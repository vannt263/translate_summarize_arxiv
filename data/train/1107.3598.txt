    "the study of aperiodic order received impetus in 1985 with the discovery of physical quasicrystals .",
    "these materials have enough long range order to produce a pure point x - ray diffraction spectrum yet they lack the strict periodicity of traditional crystals .",
    "quasicrystals are modeled by self - affine tilings of euclidean space and these tilings are effectively studied by means of an associated topological dynamical system , the tiling space .",
    "it has been established , through a beautiful circle of ideas and in considerable generality , that a pattern of points ( atoms ) produces pure point x - ray diffraction if and only if the associated tiling space has pure discrete dynamical spectrum ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "the procedure applies to tiling systems that arise from substitutions . in dimension one ,",
    "a necessary condition for a substitution tiling system to have pure discrete spectrum is that the expansion factor of the substitution be a pisot number .",

    "proposition 17.4 of @xcite ( generalized to the ` reducible ' case in @xcite ) states that it suffices to check the convergence of the balanced pair algorithm on a single balanced pair in order to determine pure discrete spectrum for a one - dimensional pisot substitution tiling system .",

    "( the proof of theorem 16.3 of @xcite , from which the one - dimensional result follows , contains a gap that is not easily plugged by the techniques of that paper .",
