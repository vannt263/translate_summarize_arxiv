    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that in the quenched - ladder approximation the gnjl model has a nontrivial phase structure @xcite in the coupling constant plane @xmath1 , where @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ critcurve ] ( @xmath3 is a cutoff ) .",
    "the critical line is @xmath4 at @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at @xmath7 , above which the gap equation for the fermion self - energy @xmath8 has a nontrivial solution .",
    "thus the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , which implies the existence of a nonzero vacuum condensate @xmath9 .",
    "one end point @xmath10 of the critical line corresponds to the ordinary njl model , while the other one @xmath11 corresponds to pure qed .",
    "the interesting feature of the gnjl model is the observation that naively irrelevant chiral invariant four - fermion operators become relevant near the chiral phase transition @xcite due to the appearance of a large anomalous dimension @xmath12 of the operator @xmath13 along the critical curve eq .",
    "( [ critline1 ] ) , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 along the part of the critical line with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore the gnjl model is believed to be renormalizable as an interacting continuum theory near a critical scaling region ( critical curve ) in the coupling plane separating a chiral symmetric phase ( @xmath16 ) and a spontaneous chiral symmetry broken phase ( @xmath17 ) .    in the ladder approximation",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the gnjl model in four dimensions is indeed renormalizable , and that the anomalous dimension @xmath18 is @xmath19 fine - tuning the coupling @xmath20 to @xmath21 in @xmath17 phase in such a way that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dynamical mass of a fermion , a nontrivial continuum limit ( @xmath24 ) can be reached just as in pure quenched qed @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of such a theory contains pseudoscalar ( @xmath25 ) and scalar ( @xmath26 ) bound states which become light and dynamically active in the vicinity of the critical line . since the phase transition is second order along the part eq .",

    "( [ critline2 ] ) , with @xmath0 is rather special .",
    "for example , an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations occurs when the line @xmath0 , @xmath27 is crossed : while light scalar and pseudoscalar excitations still persist in the broken phase , there are no such light excitations in the symmetric phase @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior has been revealed also in qed@xmath28 @xcite .",

    "computing the scalar propagator ( see fig .",

    "a technique of expansion in the chebyshev polynomials is introduced for solving the yukawa vertex with nonzero boson momentum and consequently an explicit analytical expression is derived for the propagator of the @xmath26 boson valid along the entire critical curve .",

    "further we study mainly the chiral symmetric case with @xmath47 .    with this lagrangian",
    "we define the generating functional of the gnjl model by @xmath48=n\\int { \\rm d}\\mu\\left(a,\\bar\\psi,\\psi,\\sigma,\\pi\\right ) \\ , \\exp\\left\\{is_{j } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` measure '' is defined as @xmath49 and where the source - dependent action @xmath50 is @xmath51 the last term @xmath52 represents the ultraviolet regulating part of the action .",
    "the starting point to derive the schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) is the following formal identity : @xmath53 from which the sde for the propagators and vertices in momentum space can be obtained . for our purpose",
    "it is convenient to recall the sdes for the scalar propagator and scalar vertex .",

    "the absence of kinetic terms for the @xmath26 and @xmath25 fields in the lagrangian is reflected in the constant bare propagator @xmath58 .",
    "the scalar propagator is defined as the fourier transform of the connected part of the correlator @xmath59 and the scalar vertex or yukawa vertex @xmath60 is defined as the fourier transform of the amputated vertex of the three - point correlator @xmath61_{ab}i\\delta_{\\rm s}(k - p).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the full untruncated sde for the scalar vertex in momentum space reads @xmath62_{dc } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\times(-ie_0 ^ 2)k_{cd , ab}(r , r+q , p+q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see fig .  [ fig_sde_scalvert ] ) , and the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath63 is defined as the two - fermion one - boson irreducible fermion - fermion scattering kernel . in the symmetric phase of the gnjl the pseudoscalar and scalar propagators are degenerate , so are the pseudoscalar vertex and scalar vertex .",
    "in this section we discuss the sdes for the scalar propagator and the scalar vertex in the well - known quenched - ladder approximation and introduce an approximation scheme for solving the sde for the scalar vertex .",
    "the ladder approximation is obtained by replacing the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath63 by the one photon exchange graph .",
    "furthermore the photon propagator is considered as quenched , i.e. , vacuum polarization effects are turned off , and thus the gauge coupling does not run . in principle",
    "the bethe - salpeter kernel also contains scalar and pseudoscalar exchanges .",
    "one question is whether such exchanges can be neglected .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to give a complete answer to such questions , since the answer not only depends on the short - distance behavior of the full scalar propagators and yukawa vertex which is yet unsolved , but also on the representation of the chiral symmetry . in this respect , it is interesting to note that if one includes the ladder - like one - scalar and one - pseudoscalar exchanges in the truncation of the bs kernel @xmath63 , and considers a chiral symmetry representation in which the number of scalars equals the number of pseudoscalars ( thus both scalars and pseudoscalars in adjoint representation ) , then such contributions cancel each other exactly in the symmetric phase . hence , provided scalars and pseudoscalars are considered both in the adjoint representation of the chiral symmetry , the neglect of scalar and pseudoscalar exchanges in the kernel @xmath63 seems reasonable for the sde for the yukawa vertices @xmath60 and @xmath64 .",
    "the sde equation for the scalar vertex in the ladder approximation can be written as @xmath65 ( see fig .  [ fig_sde_scalvertladder ] ) .",
    "the sde for the scalar propagator , eq .",
    "( [ sde_scalvac ] ) , is left unchanged . in the symmetric phase , the equation for the scalar vertex , eq .",
    "( [ sde_ladder ] ) , is a self - contained equation , if we note that in the landau gauge the fermion propagator is @xmath66 .",
    "the sdes in ladder approximation for scalar propagator and vertex , eqs .",
    "( [ sde_scalvac ] ) and ( [ sde_ladder ] ) , have been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , but mainly for the case of zero transfer boson momentum .    in what follows ,",
    "we present a method for solving the scalar vertex with nonzero boson momentum .",
    "the starting point is a general structure of the scalar vertex and pseudoscalar vertex .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar vertices in momentum space can be decomposed over four spinor structures with dimensionless scalar functions in the following way : @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scalar functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 depend on the squares of the minkowski momenta , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "thus by use of the notation @xmath73 we actually refer to a momentum dependence @xmath74 .",
    "unless mentioned otherwise , our investigations will be focussed mainly on the symmetric phase of the gnjl model . in the symmetric phase , the equations for the scalar functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 decouple from the equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 and @xmath76 do not contribute in scalar and pseudoscalar vacuum polarizations .",
    "in fact the integral equations for these functions are homogeneous ones and in the symmetric phase we can always take the solution @xmath79 which is a consistent one . furthermore the scalar and pseudoscalar vertex functions coincide , i.e. , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the consequence is that the scalar and pseudoscalar propagators are identical in the symmetric phase .",
    "so the problem is reduced to solving a coupled set of integral equations for two scalar functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , which has the form ( after making a standard wick rotation @xcite ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and @xmath84}{(r+q)^2 ( r - p)^2},\\label{k12}\\\\ k_{21}(p , q , r)&=&\\frac{1}{6 } \\frac{\\kappa(p , q , r)}{(r+q)^2(r - p)^4[(p\\cdot q)^2-p^2 q^2 ] } , \\label{k21}\\\\ k_{22}(p , q , r)&=&\\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{\\kappa(p , q , r)(r^2+q\\cdot r)}{(r+q)^2(r - p)^4[(p\\cdot q)^2-p^2 q^2 ] } , \\label{k22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 and @xmath86 denotes the usual angular part of the four - dimensional integration .",
    "the equations eq .  ( [ sde_vertfies ] ) are still very complicated due to the fact that the angular part of the integration can not be performed in explicit form , since the angular dependence of the yukawa vertex is unknown . without any further approximations",
    "it seems impossible to solve the equations analytically .",
    "our primary interest is the scalar propagator defined by the vacuum polarization eq .",

    "( [ k11])([k22 ] ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( for the coefficients @xmath93 see appendix  [ chebyshev ] ) .",
    "after that the angular integration can be done explicitly leading to an infinite chain of equations for harmonics @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the important thing is that only the harmonics @xmath96 contains an inhomogeneous term in the equation for it ( the constant @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ sde_vertfies ] ) ) , while other harmonics can be found iteratively once @xmath96 is computed . in other words , for the vertex function @xmath77 the scale is set by the bare vertex , i.e. , such a function has nonhomogeneous ultraviolet boundary conditions . for the vertex function @xmath78",
    "there is no such inhomogeneous term other than given indirectly by the coupling to vertex function @xmath77 .",
    "we assume that the scalar vertex function @xmath98 depends only weakly on the angle between fermion and scalar - boson momentum @xmath99 , so that an infinite set of equations for @xmath100 and @xmath101 is replaced by the equation for the zeroth - order chebyshev coefficient function @xmath96 which we shall solve exactly .",
    "the main approximation is to replace the yukawa vertex by the angular average of vertex function @xmath77 , @xmath102 since chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are precisely orthogonal with respect to such integration .",
    "then we write @xmath103 the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are respectively referred to as the ir channel ( infrared ) , and the uv channel ( ultraviolet ) .",
    "if the scalar vertex indeed weakly depends on angle between scalar - boson and fermion momentum @xmath106 flowing through the yukawa vertex , these channel functions should have the limits @xmath107 i.e. , the asymptotics of the scalar vertex are independent of the angle between @xmath106 and @xmath108 .",
