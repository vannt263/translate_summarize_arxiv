    "the einstein equations of general relativity are highly nonlinear @xcite and their solution presents a challenge that has been addressed by many researchers @xcite . an early solution of these equations is credited to schwarzschild for the field exterior to a star @xcite . however , interior solutions ( inside space occupied by matter ) are especially difficult to find due to the fact that the matter energy - momentum tensor is not zero",
    ". solutions for this case were derived for static spherical and cylindrical symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition various constraints were derived on the structure of a spherically symmetric body in static gravitational equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a conjecture stating that general relativistic solutions for shear - free perfect fluids which obey a barotropic equation of state are either non - expanding or non - rotating has been discussed in a recent review article @xcite .",
    "interior solutions in the presence of anisotropy and other geometries were considered also @xcite .",
    "in addition , interior solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations have been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive list of references for exact solutions of einstein equations ( up to the year 2009 ) appears in @xcite .    in most cases the interior solutions derived in the past considered idealized physical conditions such as constant density and pressure and ignored thermodynamic irreversible processes that might take place in the interior of the ( compact ) object which lead to the emission of radiation and heat",
    "these processes are important in the process of protostar formation due to self gravitation ( prior to nuclear ignition ) .",
    "to take this fact into account at least partially , we shall assume that the gas in the interior of these objects is isentropic .",
    "that is , the entropy produced within the object ( due to the irreversible thermodynamic and turbulent processes taking place ) is removed by heat and radiation and the gas maintains a constant entropy .",
    "the same reasoning may apply to mass ejections during gamma ray bursts .    for isentropic gas",
    "we have the following relationship between pressure @xmath0 and density @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is constant and @xmath4 is the * isentropy index*. two models for @xmath4 will be considered in this paper , one with constant @xmath4 and the other with @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 , the distance from the sphere center .",
    "it is our objective in this paper to derive interior solutions for spheres which consist of isentropic gas .",
    "in particular we shall investigate solutions to the einstein equations which represent spheres in which mass is arranged in shells .",
    "this structure might then evolve to represent the early stages of the process that leads to the formation of a solar system .",
    "in fact it was laplace in 1796 who originally put forth the hypothesis that planetary systems evolve from a family of isolated rings formed from a primitive  solar nebula \" .",
    "such a system of rings around a protostar was observed recently by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array in the constellation taurus .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the basic theory and equations that govern mass distribution and the components of the metric tensor . in section 3 we present exact , approximate and numerical solutions to these equations for spheres made of isentropic gas in which the isentropic index is a function of @xmath5 . in section 4",
    "we do the same for spheres with constant isentropic index but with @xmath6 .",
    "we summarize with some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section we present a review of the basic theory , following chapter @xmath7 in @xcite .    the general form of the einstein equations is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the contracted form of the riemann tensor @xmath11 and the ricci scalar , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the matter stress - energy tensor , @xmath14 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the speed of light in a vacuum and @xmath16 is the metric tensor .",
    "the general expression for the stress - energy tensor is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proper density of matter and @xmath19 is the four vector velocity of the flow .    in the following",

    "when matter is static @xmath26 and @xmath13 takes the following form , @xmath27 after some algebra @xcite one obtains equations for @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( where @xmath30 is the total mass of the sphere up to radius @xmath5 ) .",
    "these are @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 + \\frac{1}{2r}\\left(\\frac{d\\nu}{dr}+\\frac{d\\lambda}{dr}\\right)- \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2\\nu}{dr^2}\\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath15 is the speed of light .",
    "in addition we have the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation which is a consequence of ( [ 2.5])-([2.8 ] ) , @xmath36 in the following we normalize @xmath15 to @xmath37 ; @xmath38 remains @xmath39 .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 is known we can solve ( [ 2.7 ] ) algebraically for @xmath28 and substitute the result in ( [ 2.8 ] ) to derive the following equation for @xmath29 , @xmath40 although this is a nonlinear equation it can be linearized by the substitution @xmath41 which leads to @xmath42",
    "using the equations given in the previous section one can derive a single equation for @xmath30 for a generalized isentropic gas where both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are functions of @xmath5 @xmath43 to this end we substitute the isentropy relation ( [ 7.1 ] ) in ( [ 2.8 ] ) to obtain @xmath44 using ( [ 2.5 ] ) to substitute for @xmath1 in ( [ 7.2 ] ) , normalizing @xmath15 to @xmath37 and using the fact that @xmath45 it follows that @xmath46 using ( [ 2.6 ] ) to substitute for @xmath28 in ( [ 7.3 ] ) and solving the result for @xmath47 yields , @xmath48 differentiating this equation to obtain an expression for @xmath49 and substituting in ( [ 2.10 ] ) leads finally to the following general equation for @xmath30 @xmath50\\ } \\left(\\frac{dm(r)}{dr}\\right)^{\\alpha(r)+1 } \\\\ \\notag & & + 2r^{4 - 2\\alpha(r)}b^{1-\\alpha(r)}a(r)(2m(r)-r ) \\left(\\frac{dm(r)}{dr}\\right)^{\\alpha(r)+2}+   2r^{6 - 4\\alpha(r)}b^{2 - 2\\alpha(r)}a(r)^2 \\left(\\frac{dm(r)}{dr}\\right)^{2\\alpha(r)+1 } \\\\",

    "we explore some of the numerical solutions of this equation in the next two sections .",
    "a solution of this equation can be used then to compute the metric coefficients using ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 7.4 ] ) . with this equation",
    "it is feasible to investigate the dependence of the mass distribution on the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "although ( [ 7.5 ] ) is highly nolinear , one can obtain analytic solutions for some predetermined functional values for @xmath30 .    1 .",
    "this ansatz leads to the following relation between @xmath52 and @xmath51 : @xmath54 this relation implies that under present assumptions @xmath51 must be negative .",

    "a similar result can be obtained for @xmath67 where @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "it should be observed that the material density @xmath68 for the last three examples is constant .",
    "these examples might therefore represent different routes for the evolution of a uniform interstellar gas towards the creation of a protostar ( and nuclear ignition ) .",
    "however we were able to obtain also analytic solutions in terms of hypergeometric and heun functions for @xmath51 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "in the following we solve ( [ 2.5 ] ) through ( [ 2.8 ] ) for an isentropic gas sphere in which the isentropy index varies with @xmath5 .",
    "we discuss three examples .",

    "these conditions lead to the following equations : @xmath93 @xmath94 the solution of these equations is @xmath95 a plot of @xmath96 on a semi - log scale is given for this example in fig .",
    "this graph displays an unexpected feature which shows that @xmath4 remains close to zero except within a region in the middle of the sphere .",
