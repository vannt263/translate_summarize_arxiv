    "in recent years quantum information has been identified as an ideal ground to test the robustness of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and , at the same time , to push technology over its inherent limits . at the core of this new research field , a fundamental role",
    "is played by one of the key features of the quantum world , the superposition principle , which allows for the existence of a class of physical states without any classical analogue . given a composite bipartite system , one can engineer quantum states of the global system in which the subsystems are not in a well defined state and share some amount of genuinely quantum correlations , e.g. entanglement .",
    "quantum entanglement is recognized as an essential ingredient for most of quantum information protocols , and , therefore , a fundamental resource for quantum technology @xcite .",
    "however , the last decade has seen a great deal of attention pointed to a subtler but more general kind of quantum correlations ( qcs from now on ) .",
    "for instance , it has been established that separable ( i.e. , unentangled ) mixed states can still possess correlations of a quantum nature , which can not be described within a classical probabilistic framework @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that such general qcs play a role in performing better - than - classical algorithms for specific computational tasks @xcite , and they have been identified as a figure of merit for remote state preparation @xcite and phase estimation protocols @xcite .",
    "an intense experimental activity followed from these theoretical findings @xcite . more generally , reaching a full understanding of the deep nature of the qcs , finding out how we can exploit them , testing their accessibility and resilience under decoherence , and discovering which role they play in the study of complex and many body systems , are among the most exciting scientific challenges linking quantum information theory , complexity theory and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , general qcs are related to the disturbance induced by the measurement process on a physical system @xcite , while concepts and tools employed from information theory allow a quantitative evaluation of the amount of qcs in the state of the system .",
    "several qcs measures have been introduced @xcite and appealing operational interpretations have been associated to them @xcite . at this stage , the natural next step should be to establish a link between theoretical and experimental quantification of qcs , but , unfortunately , all the qcs measures are defined by means of a state - dependent optimization and are not directly associable with observable quantities , i.e. hermitian operators . since full state reconstruction is a tedious ,",
    "if not unfeasible , procedure , it becomes desirable to find ways to evaluate qcs by means of a smaller number of measurements than the ones required by tomographic techniques . in this direction ,",
    "appreciable attempts to detect nonvanishing qcs by observable witnesses have been realized @xcite .",
    "anyway , reminding that almost all states possess qcs @xcite and that _ the _ pivotal question around qcs is whether they are exploitable as resource , it seems worthy to pursue a more informative ( but still experimentally manageable ) quantitative characterization of qcs .    in this article",
    ", we review and update the proposal two of us presented in ref .  , which bridges the gap between theoretical and experimental evaluation of qcs .",
    "first , qcs quantifier @xmath1 for two - qubit states is introduced , directly derived from the geometric discord defined in ref .",
    ", which is given by a state - independent expression not involving any optimization procedure . also , a generalization of @xmath1 to detect bipartite qcs for states of @xmath2 dimensional systems is provided . in particular , as example given , we focus on the amount of qcs produced in the four - qubit realization of the dqc1 protocol @xcite , which recently captured the interest of the experimental community @xcite . noting that there is no need for a complete reconstruction of the state in order to calculate @xmath1 , we explore the possible direct implementation of the non - tomographic measurement scheme required to detect the value of @xmath1 on an unknown state . in particular , we express @xmath1 as a function of observable quantities @xmath3 , i.e. the expectation values of proper hermitian operators @xmath4 . the nature and",
    "the number of such operators is obviously dependent on the particular setting considered .",
    "two possibilities are taken in exam : first , we consider the nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) setting @xcite , in which we obtain information on the system by means of spin measurements . here",
    ", our protocol allows a gain ( over full state tomography ) which is linearly dependent on bob s dimension .",
    "then , we focus on the quantum optical setup , which implies to recast @xmath1 in terms of expectation values of projectors and swap operators .",
    "the number of measurements required is independent of bob s dimension @xmath0 , while the complexity of the setting , i.e. , the number of optical devices needed , increases only linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "thus , an exponential gain over tomography can be achieved in terms of required resources .",
    "the quantum circuits simulating the measurements can be designed following a well established literature @xcite . in spite of a minor advantage in terms of number of measurements , the nmr implementation is by far easier to realize than the optical one @xcite .",
    "the advantage provided by the correlation quantifier @xmath1 is even more striking in dynamical contexts . to experimentally study the evolution of qcs ,",
    "many sets of measurements need to be performed at different instants of time , thus the number of measurements required to resolve the dynamics increases dramatically .",
    "the introduction of @xmath1 and of its measurement schemes then helps in reducing the number of necessary resources compared , for instance , to those needed for full dynamical tomographic reconstruction . in view of this possibility",
    "we provide a brief discussion on the properties of the quantum correlation quantifier @xmath1 in the context of open quantum systems @xcite . due to the prominent role that qcs promise to play for realistic quantum technology , in recent years strong efforts have been made to provide a qualitative and quantitative picture on their evolution under various types of decoherence .",
    "the reader can find some relevant references of interest in the case of entanglement @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , and other quantifiers of quantum correlations dynamics @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on two different system - reservoir models for two - qubits systems .",
    "first we consider a scenario with tunable non - markovianity where each qubit is coupled with a local lorentzian environment @xcite , and we find that the quantifier @xmath1 witnesses typical non - markovian dynamical features for quantum correlation , e.g. presence of oscillations due to the non - divisibility of the associated quantum dynamical map @xcite .",
    "the second example is instead a markovian scenario where each qubit decays accordingly to a non - dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently this system has been invoked as a paradigmatic example showing a transition between a quantum and a classical decoherence regime , i.e. the presence of a time interval where quantum correlations quantified by the entropic quantum discord @xcite do not decay .",
    "other quantifiers of correlations like the geometric discord @xcite also witness a change in the decay properties of quantum correlations , despite showing a different qualitative behavior .",
    "if the quantifier @xmath1 is instead employed , however , such transition is not evident , due to the very definition of the quantity @xmath1 which does not involve minimization procedures .",
    "anyway , phenomena such as frozen discord are typical of states identified with a small number of parameters , e.g. , werner states , evolving under purpose - driven dynamics preserving such peculiarity .",
    "obviously , the state reconstruction in such occurrences does not represent a serious concern , if a prior knowledge on the form of the states under consideration is assumed .",
    "therefore the advantages of adopting @xmath1 rather than more complex measures of qcs can not be apparent in those settings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ two ] , after a brief review on geometric discord @xmath5 , we present the definition of the experimentally accessible bipartite qcs quantifier @xmath1 .",
    "we initially consider the paradigmatic two - qubit case , then a straightforward extension to @xmath2 dimensional systems is provided , and an explicit analysis carried out for the four - qubit dqc1 model @xcite .",
    "section  [ three ] describes possible implementations of the experimental schemes required to evaluate @xmath1 in laboratory . in particular , features of nmr and optical settings are explored . in section",
    "[ four ] we focus on the open system dynamics of the qcs quantifiers @xmath1 and @xmath5 in the two - qubit case , comparing their evolutions for local markovian and non - markovian channels .",
    "finally , we summarize in section  [ con ] the main points of our work , with an overview of future developments in the field .",
    "hereafter we focus on states @xmath6 of a bipartite system @xmath7 .",
    "a quantitative assessment of qcs is inherently dependent on the specific measurement we are going to make on the system . according to a conventional choice stated by the literature of the field",
    ", we consider a local measurement on one of the subsystems , say alice .",
    "the states left undisturbed by such a measurement are called `` classical - quantum '' states @xcite , and form a null - measure subset @xmath8 in the set of all density operators .",
    "their density matrix takes the following form @xmath9 where the positive coefficients @xmath10 define a probability distribution , @xmath11 are density operators of the subsystem @xmath12 and @xmath13 is an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space of subsystem @xmath14 .",
    "one can intuitively define the amount of qcs of a generic state in terms of its minimal distance from the set @xmath8 of classical - quantum states .",
    "indeed , the geometric discord @xmath5 , introduced for the two - qubit case in ref .  , is defined as @xmath15 where the hilbert - schmidt norm is employed as measure of distance between states , i.e. @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath18 .",
    "it should also be remarked that a normalization factor @xmath19 is added in the definition , in order to obtain @xmath20 as the maximum value for the @xmath5 , i.e. , in the case of bell states .",
    "geometric discord enjoys two nice theoretical interpretations .",
    "first , it quantifies the disturbance induced by local von neumann projective measurements @xmath21 on the subsystem @xmath14 @xcite @xmath22 moreover , it can be recast as the distance of a state from itself after the action of a ` root - of - unity ' local unitary operation on alice @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24 recently @xmath5 has been found out a reliable figure of merit for remote state preparation @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to remind that @xmath5 and all the discord - like measures are not symmetric under subsystems swapping , i.e. , performing the measurement on bob rather than on alice would lead to define another class of qcs signatures .",
    "geometric discord can be easily calculated for two qubits .",
    "first , one has to write the state in the bloch - fano picture@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath30 are the bloch column vectors associated to @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the entries of the correlation matrix @xmath33",
    ". then one has @xmath34-k_{\\max}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "from now on we will imply @xmath38 , assuming the same convention for all the other quantities .",
    "the minimization remaining in the definition of @xmath5 can be actually solved in closed form .",
    "since the characteristic equation of the matrix @xmath39 is a cubic with real coefficients and roots , is easily solvable by following standard techniques @xcite .",
    "indeed , the eigenvalues of @xmath39 can be found by solving an equation of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\ a_1&=&\\frac12(\\text{tr}[s]^2-\\text{tr}[s^2])\\nonumber\\\\ a_2&=&-\\frac13 ( a_1\\text{tr}[s]+a_0\\text{tr}[s^2]+\\text{tr}[s^3]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the following variables @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after a bit of algebra , one obtains @xmath43 + 2 \\sqrt{-q^3}\\cos{\\left[\\frac{\\theta+\\alpha_i}{3}\\right]}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ q&= & -\\sqrt[3]{\\frac 14 ( 6\\text{tr}[s^2]-2\\text{tr}[s]^2 ) } \\nonumber\\\\ \\theta & = & \\arccos\\left[(2 \\text{tr}[s]^3 - 9 \\text{tr}[s]\\text{tr}[s^2]+9\\text{tr}[s^3 ] ) \\sqrt{2/(3\\text{tr}[s^2]-\\text{tr}[s]^2)^3}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ \\{\\alpha_i\\}&=&\\{0 , 2\\pi,4\\pi\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now have state independent expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath39 .",
    "also , we observe that @xmath44 is an arccosine function , thus its domain is @xmath45 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath46 $ ] is therefore always reached for @xmath47 .",
    "hence , @xmath48 , and the geometric discord for an arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath6 can be recast as an explicit function of the coefficients @xmath49 @xmath50-k_1)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac23\\left(2\\text{tr}[s]-\\sqrt{6\\text{tr}[s^2]-2\\text{tr}[s]^2}\\cos\\left[\\frac\\theta3\\right]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this point , we remind that the aim is to find an observable qcs measure , i.e. to quantify correlations in terms of observable quantities .",
    "the geometric discord in expression eq .",
    "( [ dg ] ) is just a function of polynomials of the density matrix entries .",
    "protocols for writing linear and even non - linear functionals of @xmath51 in terms of expectation values of hermitian unitary operators have been extensively developed .",
    "furthermore quantum circuits estimating such quantities have been already designed @xcite . for an overview of the state of the art of the field see ref .  .",
    "thus in principle nothing prevents us from measuring geometric discord in actual experimental setups .",
    "unfortunately , in practice , the implementation of the required architecture seems rather challenging , hence it can be valuable to make a further effort and trying to define a qcs measure endowed with an even simpler and more accessible experimental evaluation .    moved by the previous considerations , we observe that in eq .",

    "[ geo ] we compare the two quantities , showing that @xmath1 is a very tight lower bound of geometric discord .",
    "more important , @xmath1 is still a faithful qcs measure .",
    "indeed , the following properties hold .",
    "* @xmath55 , being zero only for classical - quantum states @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 . to prove this , notice that the condition for vanishing @xmath1 is @xmath58 ^ 2=\\text{tr } [ s^2]$ ] . by the cayley - hamilton theorem",
    ", this implies @xmath58 ^ 3=\\text{tr}[s^3]$ ] and consequently @xmath59 . * for pure states , @xmath1 is equal to geometric discord , as it can be easily proven .",
    "the schmidt decomposition of a pure state @xmath60 of a two - qubit system reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the schmidt coefficients and @xmath63 .",
    "simple algebraic steps return @xmath64 , thus @xmath65 .    in general , for two - qubit states ,",
    "numerical and partial analytical evidences show that the following chain of inequalities holds : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the negativity , a computable entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "all those quantities coincide on pure states , completing the picture presented in ref .  .",
    "for a more advanced study of the interplay between qcs and entanglement , see ref .  .",
    "here we address the problem of measuring bipartite qcs for states of @xmath2 systems , where subsystem @xmath14 is the qubit .",
    "a generalization of geometric discord to catch bipartite qcs in such a case has been derived ( for finite @xmath0 ) in ref .  .",
    "its expression is the very same as eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the bloch - fano form for the state is @xmath68 where we can pick the generalized and normalized gell - mann matrices as basis @xmath69 of the @xmath0-dimensional subsystem @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , @xmath70 is now a @xmath0-dimensional vector and @xmath33 is a @xmath71 correlation matrix .",
    "one can notice that the matrix @xmath72 has still @xmath73 dimension , thus its characteristic equation remains a cubic and we can repeat all the previous steps to write closed expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath1 formally equivalent to eq.([dg],[q ] ) .",
    "the procedure can be extended to @xmath74 according to the prescription of ref .  .",
    "to conclude this section , we include a simple but meaningful case study to showcase a comparison of qcs measures . the dqc1 algorithm , introduced in ref .  , is a non - universal quantum computing protocol estimating the trace of a @xmath75-qubit unitary matrix @xmath76 .",

    "in nmr experiments , quantum states are realized by spinorial configurations of magnetic nuclei . at room temperature ,",
    "the @xmath75-qubit state of a nmr system is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the average thermal energy .",
    "every manipulation is implemented by varying the deviation matrix @xmath96 , which carries the actual information content of the state .",
    "a peculiarity of the nmr setting is that there is negligible entanglement in the produced states . in spite of that ,",
    "several quantum computational tasks have been satisfyingly studied and implemented by means of such a technique .",
    "it is supposed that qcs could be the key resources for the supraclassical performances in nmr environments .",
    "indeed , the dqc1 model of computation we treated in the previous section was designed thinking about nmr implementation of quantum information processing @xcite . in any case",
    ", it appears a well suited ground for investigating qcs potentialities , and definitely this is not a coincidence",
    ". measures of qcs such as geometric discord and @xmath1 are the easiest to manage at theoretical level , built by considering the density matrix of the state in the bloch - fano picture .",
    "this theoretical framework was just introduced in the refs .   for efficiently describing the resonance of magnetic nuclei under the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , what seems at first sight a merely formal coincidence , underlines in fact a privileged interweaving between geometric quantification of qcs and nmr techniques .",
    "an overview of the recent studies of qcs in this setting can be found in ref  .    in the nmr context , performing global and local spin measurements is the most convenient method for gaining information about a state .",

    "on the other hand , evaluating geometric discord @xmath5 and the lower bound @xmath1 , by definition , does not entail to know anything about bob s subsystem , i.e. , we can drop the @xmath98 measurements related to the bloch vector @xmath99 , that is @xmath100 $ ] . therefore , denoting by @xmath101 the observables to be linked with the qcs measures , one can write @xmath102 , \\nu=1,\\ldots,3 , ; \\lambda=0,\\ldots , d^2 - 1\\nonumber\\\\ d_g&=&f[\\langle o_i^{\\text{nmr}}\\rangle]\\nonumber\\\\ q&=&\\tilde{f}[\\langle o_i^{\\text{nmr}}\\rangle].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , it is relatively easy to quantify qcs in nmr setting @xcite .",
    "an experimental trick for further simplifying the considered procedure allows to restate global spin measurements as local ones on alice only , by just running a global operation on the state before the measurements @xcite . for each particular measurement ,",

    "one could maintain that when @xmath107 the global spin measurements , i.e. , estimations of the expectation values of @xmath108 as introduced in eq .",
    "( [ ext ] ) , seem extremely intricate , and the realization of the global rotation might be beyond the current technological possibilities .",
    "in such a case , at least for the paradigmatic instance in which bob is a @xmath75-qubit subsystem ( @xmath0 is even ) , we can pick , as basis @xmath69 for the @xmath0-dimensional subsystem , the tensor products of pauli matrices @xmath109 reducing the detection of @xmath32 to local spin measurements on single qubits only . in summary , for the nmr set up , the qcs quantification , by both geometric discord and @xmath1 , demands @xmath110 measurements , against the @xmath111 required by full state reconstruction .",

    "the optical implementation of projectors on @xmath156 , i.e. multiqubit projectors , is more complicated than the two - qubit case , see e.g.  ref .  .",

    ", the number of measurements would increase linearly with @xmath0 not compromising the scalability of the protocol .",
    "alternatively , we can directly rewrite @xmath0-dimensional swaps / projectors as matrix products of their two - qubit versions .",
    "we leave for future investigations an extensive treatment of this issue .",
    "in this section we will have a look at the properties of qcs , and in particular of the quantifier @xmath1 , in the context of dynamical open quantum systems .",
    "the general aim of the study of open quantum systems is to provide tools to characterize the dynamics of the state @xmath158 of a system of interest @xmath39 when it interacts with an environment @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "one of the possible ways to solve this problem is to derive an equation of motion for @xmath158 , which is usually obtained starting from the von neumann equation for the global state of system and the environment , then tracing out the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "the result is an operator equation for the state of the system only , whose structure depends however on the system - environment interaction and on all the physical parameters involved , e.g. frequencies of the environmental degrees of freedom or coupling strengths .",
    "the dynamics of correlations in open system contexts , e.g. entanglement or more general qcs , has been analyzed deeply and broadly in the last years @xcite .",
    "a key effect of the interaction with an environment is , for instance , the loss of bipartite correlations for long times , with the consequence of a final equilibrium state not presenting typical signatures of quantumness .",
    "while quantum features are lost during the whole evolution , it is not uncommon to observe a partial restoration of such properties for certain time intervals of the dynamics .",
    "these _ non - markovian _ effects are interpreted as a consequence of memory effects of the environment , capable of restoring quantum coherence or correlations for short periods of time .",
    "such a behavior usually is manifested in the very early stages of the dynamics ( non - markovian time scales ) at least for weakly coupled systems , e.g. optical systems , and therefore it is experimentally challenging to observe .",
    "a recent successful attempt is reported in ref .   where the authors make use of the measure introduced in ref .  .",
    "another interesting result appears in ref .  , where the authors show how qcs measured by quantum discord are frozen in the early stages of the dynamics .",
    "such a transition from a classical to a quantum decoherence appears qualitatively different if other measures of quantum correlations are employed , e.g. geometric discord @xcite .",
    "as we will review in section [ four1 ] , geometric discord does not remain constant at any time , but a change of dynamical behavior is anyway observed at the transition time evaluated in ref .  .",
    "the main point of interest of this section is to establish whether the approximate value of geometric discord captured by the quantifier @xmath1 is faithful during the open system dynamics of the system of interest . in the two examples we consider in the next section we will see that , since the state changes in time according to the open system dynamics",
    ", the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath1 will be in general function of time .",
    "differences in the dynamics of @xmath5 and @xmath1 are clearly due to the peculiar evolution of the parameter @xmath44 defined in eq . .",
    "the first open system model we introduce is a system made of two identical non - interacting qubits , each coupled with its own bosonic reservoir at zero temperature .",

    "it should be clear we are under the assumption that the environments have the same properties and are coupled with the same strength to the respective qubits .",

    "[ fig2b ] we show the maximum difference between geometric discord and @xmath1 .",

    "the results of this section show that , essentially , also in dynamical contexts ( at least in these two examples shown ) the correlation quantifier @xmath1 behaves as a good tight lower bound to the actual geometric discord and therefore its use is encouraged also in the case of open system dynamics thanks to its improved accessibility .",
    "some distinctive dynamical features are however not captured , and the origin of this has to be linked to the fact that , unlike @xmath5 , @xmath1 is defined without a minimization procedure over projective measurements .",
    "we discussed a proposal for quantifying bipartite qcs in states of @xmath2 dimensional composite systems at both theoretical and experimental level , building upon the results of ref .  .",
    "an analytical study of geometric discord led to define a tight meaningful lower bound @xmath1 for two - qubit states , successively extended to @xmath2 dimensions . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", @xmath1 is faithful and easy to calculate , being characterized by a state - independent expression . on the experimental side , @xmath1 is the friendliest measure we have so far , as its evaluation in laboratory appears to be in the reach of current technological levels and flexible enough to allow direct implementations in both nmr and optical settings .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 is just a function of polynomials of the density matrix entries , thus we can set a number of operators @xmath209 whose expectation values yield the value of @xmath1 , i.e. , the amount of qcs of the state . on this purpose , we have presented the accessible methods and the necessary and sufficient resources to detect the amount of qcs of an unknown @xmath210 state for both the setups . in particular , in the nmr implementation , deeply entwined with the geometric perspective for qcs as we discussed in this work , the detection of @xmath1 demands a number of local spin measurements smaller than tomography , with such a gain growing linearly with bob s dimension . on the other hand , considering optical devices , we identified the circuits to be implemented for the measurements of @xmath211 : swap or projective measurements over up to four copies of the state are required to detect qcs .",
    "it is known that a single observable is sufficient to _ detect _ nonvanishing qcs @xcite . on the other hand , in general , we need a set of at least four independent measurements to _ quantify _ the amount of qcs for states of @xmath2 systems .",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the system ( in particular , the knowledge that subsystem @xmath14 is a qubit ) is the only information we need _ a priori _ from the state , and this can be retrieved by a limited amount of supplemental resources @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath1 as a quantifier of qcs is even more evident when we are interested in dynamical contexts where the effort to reconstruct the state and therefore the correlations using standard tomographic approaches becomes even more demanding .",
    "being a tight lower bound to geometric discord , @xmath1 captures essentially the same features under decoherence dynamics , e.g. oscillations , sudden death and revivals .",
    "however attention must be payed in certain cases , e.g. sudden transitions in the dynamics of correlations , where instead @xmath1 may manifest qualitatively different , typically smoother features .",
    "reaching tangible advances on the theoretical and experimental characterization of general qcs is relevant for quantum information theory , quantum foundations and the study of complex and many - body systems .",
    "we hope to have achieved a useful step forward in this scientific effort by providing new insights on qcs quantification .",
    "nature is pervaded by evident and hidden manifestations of quantumness , and it seems legit to conjecture that some of its fundamental regulative processes are ruled and can be understood by electing qcs as primary tool of investigation .",
    "for example , we could envisage that the qc dynamics in a bipartite system @xmath39 is somewhat entwined with decoherence produced by the interaction of the system with an environment @xmath159 .",
    "furthermore , even if it is still not conclusively known whether qcs in absence of entanglement can provide some actual appreciable help in developing better - than - classical protocols for any quantum information task , it is undoubtedly worthy to explore such a possibility . experimentally sound recipes for measuring qcs for large dimensional systems , and serious engagement in studying their dynamics in the context of open quantum system , are pivotal to assess the role of qcs and their usefulness for the performance of such practical tasks in realistic conditions and , at the same time , to shed light on foundational questions of the broadest scientific prominence , such as the ultimate quantum picture of the measurement process .",

    "<S> we review a recently developed theoretical approach to the experimental detection and quantification of bipartite quantum correlations between a qubit and a @xmath0 dimensional system . specifically , introducing a properly designed measure @xmath1 , the presented scheme allows us to quantify general quantum correlations for arbitrary states of @xmath2 systems without the need to fully reconstruct them by tomographic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we take in exam the specifics of the required experimental architecture in nuclear magnetic resonance and optical settings . </S>",
    "<S> finally we extend this approach to models of open system dynamics and discuss possible advantages and limitations in such a context . </S>"
