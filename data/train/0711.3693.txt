    "the 2d velocity maps and the rotation curves of the remnants of retrograde elliptical - spiral mergers are analyzed at least 400 myr after the coalescence of the two systems ( see figs.[maps ] and [ curves ] ) .",
    "the rotation curves clearly show that the counter - rotating region is completely associated to stars initially belonging to the spiral galaxy and that counter - rotating cores are more extended in the case of e0-sa merger remnants rather than for e0-sb ones @xcite .",
    "+ initially , the redistribution of the orbital angular momentum affects mostly the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "as the interaction proceeds toward the final merging phase , tidal torques begin to affect inner regions too .",
    "if the tidal forces in the inner regions are not strong enough to reverse the initial spin of the spiral galaxy , the spiral continues to rotate with a spin parallel to the initial one , while , in turn , the outer parts can acquire an amount of orbital angular momentum sufficient to reverse their initial rotation .",
    "this causes the emergence of a counter - rotating region , among stars initially in the disk galaxy @xcite .              .",
