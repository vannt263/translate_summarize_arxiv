    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , with bolometric luminosities @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , are the most luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "ulirgs show signs of strong interactions and mergers ( melnick & mirabel 1990 , clements et al .",
    "1996 , borne et al .",
    "2000a ) , or even multiple collisions ( borne et al .",
    "2000b ) , and they have large amounts of gas and dust that significantly obscure the nuclear ionizing sources ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "ulirgs appear to be the low - redshift analogs of the high - redshift submillimeter galaxies ( scuba sources ) , which are responsible for the bulk of the far - infrared background radiation ( see sanders 1999 for a review ) .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy has shown that ulirgs with optical hii- and liner - like spectra are starbursts dominated ( lutz et al .",
    "1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz , veilleux , & genzel 1999 ) .",
    "however , the increased fraction of optically classified seyfert galaxies among the more luminous ulirgs ( log@xmath9 @xmath8 ) is taken as evidence for the presence of dust - enshrouded quasars powering these galaxies ( veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "the ionization structure of ulirgs is extended and rather complex , and therefore narrow - slit ( @xmath10 2@xmath11 ) optical spectroscopy along a given position angle can not adequately indicate the location , nature , and interplay of the different ionization mechanisms present in these galaxies .",
    "the spectral classification of some ulirgs are already known to depend on the size of the aperture ( kim , veilleux , & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "two - dimensional optical spectroscopy using fiber - fed spectrographs is an ideal technique to study the complex stellar and ionized gas structure of the nuclear regions of galaxies in general ( arribas & mediavilla 2000 ) , and of ulirgs in particular since it allows a simultaneous and complete mapping of the stellar populations and the ionized gas ( e.g. , see colina , arribas , & borne 1999 ) .",
    "iras 12112 + 0305 is a low redshift ( z= 0.0723 ) ulirg ( log@xmath12= 12.34 @xmath8 ) , classified in the optical as a liner ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ) , and with no evidence for a hidden broad - line region ( veilleux , sanders , & kim 1999 ) .",
    "mid - infrared diagnostics classify this galaxy as starburst - dominated ( genzel et al .",
    "near - infrared ground - based images revealed the presence of two nuclei ( carico et al .",
    "1990 ) , while _ hst _ optical and near - infrared images show a well defined compact point - like nucleus , as well as several much fainter condensations distributed in an arc - like structure ( borne et al .",
    "2000a ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this letter",
    "we highlight new results for iras 12112 + 0305 obtained using integral field optical spectroscopy and _ hst _ imaging . throughout the paper a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath5",
    "mpc@xmath5 is assumed .",
    "integral field spectroscopy of iras 12112 + 0305 was obtained with the integral system ( arribas et al .",
    "1998 ) , a fiber - fed spectrograph mounted at the naysmith no . 1 platform of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "the bundle of fibers consisted of 219 fibers , each 0.9@xmath11 in diameter and covering a 16.5@xmath11 @xmath2 12.3@xmath11 field - of - view .",
    "the spectra were taken using a 600 line / mm grating , covering the 5000@xmath137900   range , with an effective resolution of 4.8 .",
    "the total integration time was 7500 sec , split into five separate integrations of 1500 sec each , with seeing @xmath14 .",
    "the reduction has been done following the standard procedures applied to spectra obtained with two - dimensional fiber spectrographs ( arribas et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure  1 , together with the _ hst _ @xmath15-band image ( borne et al .",
    "2000a ) for comparison .",
    "the derived astrophysical properties for the main continuum and line - emitting regions are presented in table  1 .",
    "columns 2 and 3 give the relative positions .",
    "column 4 presents the internal reddening values derived from the h@xmath16/h@xmath17 ratio , assuming case b recombination .",
    "column 5 gives the apparent magnitude within an aperture of 0.5@xmath11 radius using the _ hst _ @xmath15-band image , and column 6 gives the corresponding absolute magnitude after internal reddening correction assuming @xmath18= 1.494 @xmath2 e(b@xmath13v ) .",
    "column 7 shows the observed h@xmath16 flux obtained using an aperture of 2.1@xmath11 diameter , while column 8 gives the reddening - corrected h@xmath16 luminosity .",
    "the last four columns present the logarithm of the reddening - corrected emission line ratios and the corresponding activity classification .",
    "the stellar main body of iras 12112 + 0305 is concentrated in three dominant regions , each separated from each other by about 2@xmath19 ( see the h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 continuum images in figure  1 ) .",
    "two of these regions ( called n@xmath20 and n@xmath21 hereinafter ; see table  1 for relative positions ) located along position angle pa45 , were already detected in the near - infrared , and associated with the nuclei of two galaxies involved in the final stages of a merger ( carico et al .",
    "the integral - generated continuum images extend the wavelength coverage towards the blue , clearly showing the presence of a large differential extinction towards the southern nucleus ( n@xmath20 ) .",
    "the third region ( called r2 hereinafter ) is located 3@xmath11 north of n@xmath20 at position angle pa20 .",
    "the _ hst _ @xmath15-band image ( figure  1 ) shows n@xmath20 as a high - surface brightness compact region which coincides with the k - band point - like nucleus ( scoville et al .",
    "regions n@xmath21 and r2 are made of several fainter condensations distributed along an arc - like structure of about 5.4@xmath11 ( i.e. , 8 kpc ) extent and located 3@xmath11 to 5@xmath11 ( i.e. , 4.5 to 7.5 kpc ) north@xmath13northeast of n@xmath20 .",
    "the brightest of these condensations , located 3@xmath11 ( @xmath22 4.5 kpc ) northeast from n@xmath20 , is most likely associated with the northern nucleus detected in the integral - generated continuum images ( n@xmath21 ) and in the near - infrared ( carico et al . 1990 ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although the overall structure of the ionized gas resembles that of the stellar light distribution , the dominant line - emitting regions do not coincide with the nuclei identified above but , on the contrary , are decoupled from them ( see [ oiii ] and h@xmath16 maps in figure  1 ) .",
    "the brightest line - emitting region ( called r1 hereinafter ) is located 5@xmath11 ( @xmath22 7.5 kpc ) east of n@xmath20 along position angle pa80 .",
    "this region is associated with a faint @xmath15-band continuum source ( @xmath23= 20.4 ) outside the main body of the galaxy ( see _ hst _ @xmath15-band image in figure  1 ) .",
    "the second - brightest h@xmath16 line - emitting region is associated with region r2 , and it is therefore composed of a filament of faint continuum condensations that are also detected in the h@xmath17 and [ oiii ] maps ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the optically dominant nucleus of the galaxy ( n@xmath20 ) is marginally detected in [ oiii ] and appears as the faintest h@xmath16 emission source .",
    "the arc - like structure seen in the _ hst _ @xmath15-band image corresponds to three well resolved h@xmath16 line - emitting peaks , the faintest of which is associated with the northern nucleus ( n@xmath21 ) detected in the optical and near - infrared ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the positions of the two apparently faint ionizing nuclei n@xmath21 and n@xmath20 coincide ( within the _ hst _ absolute astrometry uncertainties of @xmath240.7@xmath251@xmath11 ) with the two bright compact starburst nuclei detected at radio frequencies ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) , thus favoring dust - enshrouded nuclear starbursts as the energy sources in these nuclei .    the ionization sources in n@xmath20 and n@xmath21 are highly obscured , with visual extinctions ( @xmath26 ) of 8 and 3.5 magnitudes , respectively ( see spectra in figure 2 ) .",
    "the two nuclei appear almost equally bright with @xmath15-band absolute magnitudes of @xmath1318.9 ( n@xmath20 ) and @xmath1318.5 ( n@xmath21 ) .",
    "however , when reddening is taken into account , n@xmath20 is found to be ten times more luminous than n@xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath2722.8 ) .",
    "these magnitudes are within the range of those measured for the nuclei of other luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( surace et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the line ratios of the ionization sources associated with the nuclei n@xmath20 and n@xmath21 correspond to a mixture of weak-[oi ] liner and hii region spectra ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the presence of weak-[oi ] liners in the nucleus of galaxies has been taken as evidence for ionization by hot stars in a high - metallicity environment ( filippenko & terlevich 1992 ; shields 1992 ) or for ionization by a mixture of a low - luminosity agn and hot stars ( ho et al .",
    "the integrated mid - infrared spectrum of iras 12112 + 0305 does not show any evidence for an agn ( genzel et al 1998 ) , further supporting the idea that the ionizing sources in the nuclei n@xmath20 and n@xmath21 are associated with dust - enshrouded starbursts .",
    "although n@xmath20 and n@xmath21 are minor contributors to the observed h@xmath16 emission , the reddening - corrected flux emanating from these nuclei dominates the overall h@xmath16 luminosity with a value of 9.1 @xmath2 10@xmath28 erg s@xmath5 ( table  1 ) .",
    "if the h@xmath16 flux emitted by the two nuclei were entirely due to stars , then the corresponding star formation rate would amount to about 80 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 for a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with mass limits of 0.1 and 100 @xmath4 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the _ hst _ image ( figure  1 ) shows that the apparently more luminous line - emitting peak ( r1 ) is associated with a faint ( @xmath23= 20.35 ) region characterized by a physical size of about 600 parsecs ( @xmath22 0.4@xmath11 ) , an @xmath15-band absolute magnitude of @xmath1317.7 , an internal optical extinction of about one magnitude , and an h@xmath16 luminosity of 8.7 @xmath2 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath5 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the size , h@xmath16 luminosity and emission line ratios are typical of circumnuclear star - forming regions in nearby spirals ( gonzalez - delgado & prez 1997 ; planesas , colina , & prez - olea 1997 ) , and of giant extragalactic hii regions like ngc 5471 in m101 ( shields 1990 ) . the h@xmath16 luminosity and the equivalent widths of the h@xmath17 ( 74 @xmath24 3 ) and h@xmath16 ( 450 @xmath24 10  ) emission lines correspond to that of a 5-myr old ionizing cluster of 2 @xmath2 10@xmath30 @xmath4 , assuming a salpeter imf with mass limits of 0.1 and 100 @xmath4 ( leitherer et al .",
    "the mass of the ionizing cluster represents only a small fraction ( @xmath1 3% ) of the dynamical mass of this region ( upper limit of 7.5 @xmath2 10@xmath31 @xmath4 ) , calculated assuming virialization and an instrument - corrected emission line width equivalent to a velocity dispersion of 60 km s@xmath5 ( derived from the line - width measurements of the h@xmath17 and [ oiii]5007   lines ) .    in summary ,",
    "the derived properties of this region are characteristic of young massive hii regions and could represent a case for a tidally - induced giant extranuclear self - gravitating star - forming region , or even a dwarf galaxy , decoupled from the much older stellar body of the parent galaxies ( duc & mirabel 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "integral field optical spectroscopy and _ hst _ imaging have revealed the complex stellar and ionized gas structures in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy iras 12112 + 0305 .",
    "the two nuclei detected in the optical coincide with previously known radio and near - infrared nuclei , but appear as the apparently two faintest line - emitting regions and are consistent with dust - enshrouded ( a@xmath32= 3.5 and 8 mag ) weak-[oi ] liners .",
    "however , their reddening - corrected h@xmath16 emission dominates the overall h@xmath16 luminosity of the system and , if associated with nuclear starbursts , would correspond to a star formation of 80 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the observed structure of the ionized gas is decoupled from , and hence does not trace , the stellar light distribution .",
    "the brightest line - emitting peak is associated with a faint ( @xmath23= 20.4 ) region located 7.5 kpc from the dominant optical nucleus ( n@xmath20 ) , well outside the main stellar body of the system .",
    "this region appears to be a recent ( tidally induced ? ) star - forming region containing a young ( 5 myr ) , massive ( 2 @xmath2 10@xmath30 @xmath4 ) cluster of stars .    the results presented here for iras 12112 + 0305 stress the need for integral - field spectrographs in the study of the complex ionization and stellar light structure of ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "similar studies for high - redshift analogs of ulirgs ( i.e. , the scuba sources ) , and for other morphologically complex high - redshift galaxies , will become feasible when integral - field spectrographs on giant telescopes become operational .",
