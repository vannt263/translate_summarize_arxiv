    "there have been many debates on the nature of v  sge .",
    "@xcite suggested a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) nature from their observations .",
    "they claimed that the observed changes in the line profiles through the eclipse were similar to the rotational disturbance expected from the eclipse of an accretion disk .",

    "@xcite also found that no evidence of a rotational disturbance in their high - state spectroscopy of h@xmath4 .",
    "has been suggested to be a supersoft x - ray source ( sss ) @xcite .",
    "this suggestion stems from similarities in the orbital light curve shapes between v  sge and the lmc supersoft x - ray source cal 87 and in the long - term soft x - ray behaviors between v  sge and the lmc supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath36951 .",
    "soft x - rays were detected only during the optical low states @xcite , although this is not yet fully established in v  sge because of their sparse period coverage in x - rays .",

    "however , it should be noted that no one successfully proposed a model of the transition between the optical high and low states .",
    "the key observational features necessary to be elucidated here are : ( 1 ) v sge exhibits long - term transitions between optical high ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 days ) and low ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 days ) states with the total durations of about 300 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section",
    ", we will show how to construct our binary models that reproduce orbital modulations in the optical high and low states .",
    "we adopt a binary system consisting of a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) , a disk around the wd , and a lobe - filling , main - sequence ( ms ) companion ( see an illustration of fig . [ emission_region ] ) .      in this section , we assume the wd mass of @xmath14 taking the results of  6 in advance , i.e. , @xmath15 we adopt the ephemeris by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath16 at eclipse minima ( see also , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the secondary mass is determined as follows : @xcite estimated each component mass from the observed radial velocities .",
    "they assumed that the weaker fluorescent line correctly traces the motion of the primary while the stronger fluorescent line follows the motion of the secondary , i.e. , @xmath17 from @xmath18  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath19 from @xmath20  km  s@xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the inclination angle of the binary .",
    "radial velocities of these two sharp lines are oscillating in the same period of the eclipsing binary and in anti - phase each other .",
    "moreover , gamma velocities of these two lines are almost coincident .",
    "we do not think that the other lines such as h and are correct tracers of binary components because they are broad and their gamma velocities are not consistent with those of fluorescent lines .    here , we reexamine the companion mass . we assume , following herbig et al.s paper , that the weaker fluorescent line correctly traces the motion of the primary , i.e. , @xmath22  km  s@xmath2 @xcite , but do not think that the stronger fluorescent line correctly follows the motion of the secondary .",
    "the reason is as follows : when the companion star is strongly irradiated by a luminous ( hydrogen shell - burning ) wd , its surface temperature is much higher at the irradiated hemisphere than that of the other side ( see fig .",
    "[ emission_region ] ) .",
    "probably the stronger fluorescent line should trace more closely the irradiated hemisphere of the cool component . as a result",
    ", it is very likely that the observed orbital velocity of the stronger fluorescent line is a bit slower than the motion of the cool component as seen in figure [ emission_region ] .",
    "if this is the case , the observed velocity of @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 does not represent the true radial velocity of the cool companion .",
    "figure [ orbital_velocity ] shows the relation between the orbital radial velocities and the ms companion mass derived from kepler motion with the period of 0.514 days .",
    "this figure shows the secondary mass between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath22  km  s@xmath2 , and the orbital radial velocity of @xmath26  km  s@xmath2 . here",

    "the radius of @xmath31 zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) star is @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the secondary is a main - sequence ( ms ) star but it is undersized and probably underluminous because of thermal imbalance by the kelvin - helmholtz timescale mass - transfer .",
    "we assume @xmath33  k for non - irradiated temperature of the ms companion .",
    "the inclination angle is determined by light curve fitting as described below .",
    "it should be noted here that the thermal timescale mass - transfer is realized for the mass ratio @xmath34 and the mass transfer rate can reach @xmath35  yr@xmath2 or more ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our binary models for numerical calculation are illustrated in figure [ w125m30configure80 ] .",
    "a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "we also assume that the photospheric surfaces of the wd , the ms companion , and the disk emit photons as a blackbody at a local temperature that varies with position . the numerical method adopted here was fully described in @xcite .      the irradiation effects both of the disk and of the ms companion play an essential role in the light curve modeling .",
    "for the basic structure of the accretion disk , we assume an axisymmetric structure with the size and thickness of @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the outer edge of the accretion disk , @xmath39 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , @xmath40 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , and @xmath41 is the distance from the symmetric axis .",
    "since the orbital light curve modulations of v  sge show a nonaxisymmetric shape , we introduce an asymmetric configuration of the accretion disk as done by @xcite .",
    "they explained an asymmetric feature in the orbital light curves of the lmc luminous supersoft x - ray source cal 87 .",
    "the cause is that the gas stream from the companion hits the edge of the accretion disk and makes a vertical spray when the mass transfer rate is as high as in the luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( @xmath42  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "we have also introduced the same type of asymmetry of the accretion disk as schandl et al.s , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a parameter specifying the degree of asymmetry , @xmath47 is the starting angle of the vertical spray , at @xmath48 the vertical spray reaches its maximum height , this maximum height continues until the angle of @xmath49 , the elevated rim disappear at the angle of @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the starting radius ratio from where the vertical spray is prominent , @xmath52 is the height of the disk surface from the equatorial plane for the asymmetric case .",
    "the azimuthal angle is measured from the phase at the wd component in front of the ms companion , i.e. , from the phase at the secondary eclipse ( see fig . [ emission_region ] ) . here",

    "recent analysis on the recurrent nova ci aql 2000 outburst @xcite and the lmc supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513 @xcite indicates that the irradiation area of the disk is blown in the wind and extends up to the companion star or over ( @xmath72 or over ) as schematically shown in figure [ opaque_disk ] .",
    "this physically means that ( 1 ) the surface layer of the accretion disk is blown off and accelerated up to , at least , several hundred km  s@xmath2 like a free stream going outward , and that ( 2 ) the optically thick part of the disk surface ends somewhere far outside the roche lobe as seen in figures [ w125m30configure80]a and [ opaque_disk]a . here , we adopt @xmath57 during the massive wind phase but @xmath65 in the no massive wind phase @xcite .",

    "the temperature of the outer rim of the disk is assumed here to be 10000  k. we have checked that the light curves are hardly changed even if 8000  k or 12000  k is adopted as an outer rim temperature instead of 10000  k.      the ms companion is also irradiated by the wd . as already shown by @xcite , the irradiation effect alone can not closely reproduce the orbital modulations .",
    "@xcite adopted a redistribution of the irradiated energy with a diffusion angle of @xmath74 to reproduce a relatively round shape of orbital modulations just before / after the eclipse minima .",
    "here , we also adopt the same type of redistributions of irradiated energy , but with a bit larger diffusion angle of @xmath75 instead of @xmath74 .",
    "the irradiation efficiency is the same as that of @xcite , i.e. , assumed to be @xmath76 , i.e. , 50% of the irradiated energy is emitted but the residual 50% is converted into thermal energy .",
    "the distribution of surface temperature is determined by the constraint that the total of the emitted energy is equal to the sum of 50% of the irradiated energy and the emitted energy with the original surface temperature of 12,000  k.",

    "such a massive and fast wind affects the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "because of a large velocity difference between the wind and the disk surface , it certainly drives the kelvin - helmholtz instability at the interface .",
    "only the surface layer of the disk is dragged away outward with the velocity at least several hundred km  s@xmath2 like a free stream moving outward .",
    "this surface free stream is optically thick near the original disk but becomes optically thin somewhere outside because of geometrical dilution effect .",
    "we regard the transition place from optically thick to thin as the edge of the extended disk ( see fig . [ opaque_disk ] ) . in this sense",

    "it should be noted that a high density part of the disk ( dark - hatched region in fig .",
    "[ opaque_disk ] ) is hardly changed by this relatively tenuous disk surface free stream because the internal density of the disk is much denser than that of the wd wind .",
    "the wind mass loss rate reaches about @xmath92  yr@xmath2 and its velocity is @xmath93  km  s@xmath2 , so that the density of the wind is estimated from the continuity ( @xmath94 ) to be about @xmath95 g  @xmath96 at the distance of @xmath97 from the center of the wd .",

    "( 1 ) , @xcite have shown that an elevated edge of the disk reproduce the light curve of the supersoft x - ray source cal 87 , which is very similar to the faint state of v  sge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as for assumption ( 2 ) , @xcite also showed that a diffusion effect on the secondary surface is important to explain a wide primary eclipse ( or a round shape just outside the primary eclipse ) . the same round shape just outside the primary eclipse was also observed in the recurrent nova ci aql 2000 outburst and such a round shape can be reproduced by the same effect @xcite .",
    "as for assumption ( 3 ) , the mass transfer rate becomes as large as the eddington limit for white dwarfs in the optical low ( faint ) state , i.e. , @xmath111 as will be shown in the following section .",
    "in such high accretion rates , a part of matter overflows the inner critical roche lobe . however , the size of the disk , i.e. , @xmath112 , is still smaller than the outer critical roche lobe .",

    "@xcite counted it one of the evidences against the model in which the hotter component is a source of soft x - rays . in our model , however , the hot component ( white dwarf ) is blocked at least twice , i.e. , by the edge of the disk and by the companion as seen in figure [ w125m30configure80 ] .",
    "furthermore , in some configurations of the disk like in figure [ w125m30configure80 ] , this occultation of the hot component by the disk edge continues from binary phase @xmath113 to @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 orbital periods , which may explain a modulation frequency of a third of the orbital period .",
    "the long - term optical behavior of v sge shows a quasi - regular transition between high and low states ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent summary of the long - term variations ) . in this section , we reproduce the long - term optical variations based on an optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs @xcite .      an essential point of our wind model is that wds blow a fast and massive wind when the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for other cases of hydrogen content and metallicity ) .",

    "the disk surface flow is line - driven , therefore , we see an optically thin wind going outward along the disk surface .",
    "when the disk edge is asymmetric as illustrated in figure [ pole_on_view ] , the disk surface flow is also asymmetric because the elevated edge of the disk suppresses effective acceleration .",

    "( 4 ) from phase 0.5 to 0.8 the behavior of the line is opposite to that of phase 0.1 to 0.4 as easily understood from figure [ pole_on_view ] .",

    "phase - resolved spectra of the @xmath307 and h@xmath178 in the optical low states were obtained by @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of the emission lines were measured by a double - gaussian convolution method .",
    "their results are summarized as follows : + ( 1 ) the radial velocity amplitudes of @xmath307 and h@xmath178 agree with each other , i.e. , @xmath308  km  s@xmath2 , by gaussian components half - separated by @xmath309  km  s@xmath2 for @xmath307 and by @xmath310  km  s@xmath2 for h@xmath178 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) positive - to - negative velocity crossing occurs at phase 0.93 , that is , the largest positive velocity is reached at phase 0.68 and the smallest negative velocity is attained at phase 0.18 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the h@xmath178 line flux presents a sharp maximum during phase 0.0 , which indicates that the balmer line formation region is not eclipsed , while the @xmath307 line flux reaches minimum at phase 0.0 , indicating a partial eclipse of a highly ionized region .",
    "we attribute the @xmath307 line formation region to a relatively inner portion of the disk but the h@xmath178 line formation region both to an outer portion of the disk and the irradiated ms companion ( see fig .",
    "[ pole_on_view ] ) .",
    "the disk surface flow is accelerated by the central wd and its outflow velocity gradually increases outward .",
    "this tendency is roughly consistent with the gaussian component velocities of @xmath309  km  s@xmath2 ( inner portion of the @xmath307 line ) and @xmath310  km  s@xmath2 ( outer portion of the h@xmath178 ) .",
    "the disk structure is asymmetric as shown in figure [ pole_on_view ] , so that we observe the largest positive velocity at phase 0.65 ( midpoint between phase 0.4 and 0.9 ) and the lowest negative velocity at phase 0.15 if the disk surface flow is much faster than the orbital motion . adding the orbital motion of the wd to the disk outflow",
    ", the phase of the largest positive velocity should be shifted a bit later because the orbital motion reaches its largest velocity at phase 0.75 .",
    "therefore , phase 0.68 is reasonable . for the lowest negative velocity",
    ", the phase should also be delayed from phase 0.15 because the orbital motion of the wd component reaches the lowest negative value at phase 0.25 . in this sense ,",
    "phase 0.18 is also reasonable .    during phase 0.5 to 0.8 ,",
    "the blue shifted component of the disk flow is blocked by the elevated disk edge as seen in figure [ pole_on_view ] , so that an extended blue wing is probably cut in the spectra as well as the self - absorption feature .",
    "@xcite showed contour maps of phase - resolved line intensities both for the @xmath307 and h@xmath178 lines . the above feature is clearly shown in figures 4 and 5 of @xcite both for the @xmath307 and h@xmath178 lines .",
    "closely looking at the radial velocity change of the reddest contour in figures 4 and 5 of @xcite , we easily find that the radial velocity reaches maximum of @xmath288  km  s@xmath2 at phase @xmath114 and minimum of @xmath311  km  s@xmath2 at phase @xmath312 , which suggests an amplitude of @xmath313  km  s@xmath2 and an outflow velocity of @xmath314  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these kinematic velocities are consistent with our wd wind model .",
    "however , the bluest contour shows the minimum velocity of @xmath315  km  s@xmath2 at phase 0.2 and the maximum velocity of @xmath316  km  s@xmath2 at phase 0.6 for the @xmath307 line .",
    "this asymmetric feature is very similar to those of @xmath307 emission line in the optical high state ( see fig .",
    "[ he2_line_high ] ) , although the outflow velocity is smaller in the low state .",
    "it is therefore likely that the blue edges of these emission lines are self - absorbed even in the optical low state , unless it is significantly contaminated by @xmath232 complex in the blue edge over @xmath315  km  s@xmath2 .    to summarize , our wd wind model possibly gives us natural explanations of the observational features , i.e. , @xmath307 emission ( together with h@xmath4 ) in the optical high states and @xmath317 emissions , doublet @xmath318 and 1551 , and @xmath307 emission ( together with h@xmath178 ) in the optical low states , at least qualitatively .",
    "@xcite pointed out that soft x - ray flux of v  sge is too weak to be compatible with the typical supersoft x - ray sources , for example , at least two or three orders of magnitude lower than that of cal  87 . in this subsection",
    ", we try to resolve this problem .",
    "our numerical results are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the distance to v  sge is 3  kpc , ( 2 ) the temperature of the wd is between @xmath319  ev as seen in figure [ vmag1250m35_long_time_fit_vsge ] , and ( 3 ) the bolometric luminosity is @xmath320  erg  s@xmath2 . if we adopt the color excess of @xmath321 and the corresponding hydrogen column density of @xmath322  cm@xmath2 @xcite , the rosat / pspc count rate is calculated to be larger than 2  counts  s@xmath2 . however , the observed rate is only 0.02  counts  s@xmath2 @xcite , at least , two orders of magnitude smaller than that of our wd model",
    ".    the central wd is always occulted by the elevated disk edge in the cal  87 model ( model d ) of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a substantial part of soft x - rays can penetrate the elevated edge of the disk , i.e. , the spray is semi - transparent at short wavelength ( see private communication of f. meyer in * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , @xcite formulated x - ray radiation reprocessing in the elevated edge of the disk . in their results , some fraction of soft x - rays leak from the elevated edge that consists of many small size cloud blobs and hot ( @xmath324  k ) intercloud medium . the mass transfer rate in cal  87 is estimated to be as small as @xmath42  yr@xmath2 and two orders of magnitude smaller than that for our v  sge model .",
    "it is very likely that the density of spray is much ( e.g. , two orders of magnitude ) larger in v  sge than in cal  87 .",
    "this much more opaque elevated disk edge results in a very low flux of soft x - rays even if the system configuration ( orbital period and inclination ) is almost the same between these two systems .",
    "@xcite concluded that the model suggested for can not explain the x - ray and optical variabilities of .",
    "their reasons are as follows : ( 1 ) both the transitions , from the faint to bright and the bright to faint , are very rapid , so that they may occur in within one day ( compared to the smooth decline of several days in ) .",
    "( 2 ) the expected optical eclipse would become deeper in the brighter state , opposite to what has been observed @xcite .    their assumed model for",
    "is based on the photospheric expansion / contraction model of the wd envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their conclusions suggest only that the photospheric expansion / contraction model does not apply to .",
    "as already shown in @xcite , the photospheric expansion / contraction model can not explain the x - ray variability even for because the emergence / decay timescale of supersoft x - rays is also as short as @xmath325 days @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our model can naturally explain the above two observational features as follows : ( 1 ) the irradiated disk is a main source of the optical light and its flaring - up edge is very variable in a dynamical timescale , i.e. , a day or so .",
    "this also naturally explain the optical variability from night to night @xcite .",
    "the difference in the optical variabilities between and may come from the difference in the inclination angle , i.e. , @xmath326 for but @xmath327 for @xcite .",
    "the irradiated area of the flaring - up disk viewed from the earth varies much more largely in the binary system with a higher inclination angle .",
    "( 2 ) as recently reported in @xcite , the eclipse depth of is deeper in the optical low state than in the optical high state .",
    "this is the same as what has been observed in .",
    "our models can reproduce the orbital modulations both in the optical high and low states both for and .",
    "thus , we may conclude that is essentially the same type of objects as , and its galactic counterpart .",
    "thus , our optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs can reproduce many observational features of v  sge .",
    "we suggest that v  sge is the second example of accretion wind evolution , which is a key evolutionary process to type ia supernovae in a recently developed evolutionary scenario @xcite . in the accretion wind evolution phase , the donor transfers mass to the white dwarf at a high rate of @xmath1",
    "yr@xmath2 or more . in an old picture",
    ", the white dwarf expands to a giant size to form a common envelope and results in merging .",
    "however , the white dwarf begins to blow a massive wind in such a high mass accretion rate instead of simply expanding .",
    "a formation of common envelope is avoided and the separation of the binary is almost unchanged . in the accretion wind evolution phase ,",
    "the white dwarf accretes matter and burns hydrogen atop the white dwarf core .",
    "then , the white dwarf can grow in mass at the critical rate , @xmath328  yr@xmath2 , up to the chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes as a type ia supernova . with the first and second examples of accretion wind evolution @xcite in the lmc and in our galaxy",
    ", we may conclude that accretion wind evolution is established in the evolutionary scenario to type ia supernovae .",
    "in other words , accretion wind evolution commonly occurs in the supersoft x - ray sources when the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate of @xmath1  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the life time of phenomena is as short as @xmath329  yr , because the mass transfer rate is as large as @xmath330  yr@xmath2 .",
    "belongs to the helium - rich supersoft x - ray source channel in the type ia supernova scenario of @xcite .",
    "this channel can produce about one type ia supernova per millennium , indicating that we have a chance to observe about a hundred v sagittae stars in our galaxy .",
    "@xcite have already listed four stars in our galaxy and discussed their similar properties .",
    "although the mass of the companion star to the wd is not clearly identified yet , their orbital periods fall in the range of @xmath331 days , being very consistent with the orbital periods that the new scenario predicted ( see fig . 3 of * ?",
    "we have proposed a model of long - term optical variations in the peculiar binary v  sge based on an optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs .",
    "our binary model , which is consisting of a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) , an accretion disk around the wd , and a lobe - filling main - sequence ( ms ) companion star , reproduces orbital light curves both for the optical high and low states .",
    "moreover , our wd wind model naturally explains the transition between the optical high and low states .    here , we summarize our main results : +",
    "when the mass accretion rate to the white dwarf exceeds a critical rate , the white dwarf photosphere expands to blow a fast and massive wind .",
    "the disk surface is blown in the wind and optically thick parts of the disk extend to a large size over the roche lobe .",
    "the largely extended disk , which is irradiated by a wd photosphere , contributes much to the optical light .",
    "this corresponds to the optical high states .",
    "the fast and massive wind hits the donor star and strips off the surface layer .",
    "the mass transfer rate from the donor is attenuated . as a result",
    ", the wind gradually weakens and stops .",
    "then the disk shrinks to a size of the roche lobe .",
    "this ( no wind ) phase corresponds to the optical low states because the disk irradiation area also becomes small . +",
    "* 3 . * in the optical bright state , we are able to reproduce the orbital light curves of with a large extension of the disk . in the optical faint state ,",
    "the orbital light curves are reproduced with a small size ( similar size to the roche lobe ) of the disk having an elevated edge as seen in the supersoft x - ray sources .",
    "the massive wind easily shields supersoft x - rays .",
    "therefore , soft x - rays are not detected in the wind phase , i.e. , in the optical high state .",
    "this is consistent with the soft x - ray behavior found by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our wind model also explain the hard x - ray component during the optical high state if they are shock - origin @xcite .",
    "the observed radio flux indicates a wind mass loss rate of @xmath9  yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs naturally explain such a high mass loss rate . +",
    "various features of the emission lines both in the optical high and low states are also naturally explained by our model . +",
    "* optically thick winds from mass - accreting wds play an essential role in a recently developed evolutionary scenario of type ia supernovae @xcite . this process is called accretion wind evolution .",
    "v  sge is the second example of accretion wind evolution with the first example of the lmc supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath36951 @xcite . with these two examples of accretion wind evolution , we may conclude that optical high / low states with wind being on / off are a common physical feature in the supersoft x - ray sources if the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate of @xmath1  yr@xmath2 . +",

    "<S> v sagittae shows quasi - periodic optical high ( soft x - ray off ) and low ( soft x - ray on ) states with the total period of @xmath0 days . a binary model is presented to explain orbital light curves both for the high and low states as well as the transition mechanism between them . </S>",
    "<S> the binary model consists of a white dwarf ( wd ) , a disk around the wd , and a lobe - filling main - sequence ( ms ) companion . in the optical low state , </S>",
    "<S> the mass transfer rate to the wd is small and the size of the disk is as small as its roche lobe size . in the optical high state , the mass transfer rate to the wd exceeds the critical rate of @xmath1  yr@xmath2 , and the wd blows an optically thick , massive wind . </S>",
    "<S> surface layers of the disk are blown in the wind and the disk surface extends to the companion or over . as a result , optical luminosity of the disk increases by a magnitude because of its large irradiation effect . </S>",
    "<S> the massive wind completely obscures soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the optical high / soft x - ray off state . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between optical high and low states is driven by an attenuation of the mass transfer from the secondary . during the optical high state </S>",
    "<S> , the wind from the wd hits the companion and strips off its surface layer . </S>",
    "<S> the mass transfer from the companion gradually reduces and stops . as the mass supply stops </S>",
    "<S> , the wd wind weakens and eventually stops . </S>",
    "<S> the disk shrinks to a roche lobe size and the optical magnitude drops . </S>",
    "<S> this phase corresponds to the optical low / soft x - ray on state . </S>",
    "<S> then a rapid mass transfer resumes . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the wd envelope increases and it blows a wind again . </S>",
    "<S> this cycle is repeated like a limit cycle . during this intermittent wind phase </S>",
    "<S> , the wd can grow in mass at the critical rate and eventually reach the chandrasekhar mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> this process is called `` accretion wind evolution , '' which is a key evolutionary process in a recently developed evolutionary scenario of type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this evolutionary process was first confirmed in the lmc supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath36951 , although it commonly occurs in the supersoft x - ray sources when the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , v  sge is the second example of accretion wind evolution . </S>"
