    "the local group hosts three spiral galaxies : the milky way , m31 , and m33 .",
    "the milky way and m31 are the only massive galaxies in the local group , and there are indications that m31 is more representative of massive spirals than the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while m33 is the third most massive galaxy in the local group , it is a distant third @xcite , and it is representative of the most common type of spiral galaxy in the local universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "because m31 and m33 are at respective distances of 770 kpc @xcite and 860 kpc @xcite , we can obtain photometry of their resolved stellar populations and thus constrain their star formation histories at a fidelity exceeding that possible in the milky way , where such studies of the field population are often hampered by distance and reddening uncertainties .",
    "here , i review the observational constraints on the spheroid ( bulge and halo ) populations of these galaxies .",
    "spheroids are generally dominated by stars older than 1  gyr . in such populations , changes with age are less dramatic than they are for younger systems .",
    "the best age diagnostics come from photometry reaching low - mass ( @xmath00.8 @xmath1 ) main sequence ( ms ) stars ; such photometry enables the reconstruction of the complete star formation history with an age resolution of @xmath01  gyr , but it is difficult to obtain such photometry outside the milky way system , due to crowding and depth limitations .",
    "age constraints are also available through photometry of later evolutionary phases , such as the horizontal branch ( hb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and red giant branch ( rgb ) ; relative to ms stars , these brighter stars can be detected in more distant and crowded regions , but the age resolution is poorer , allowing one to distinguish between young ( @xmath23  gyr ) , intermediate - age ( 38 gyr ) , and old ( @xmath3813  gyr ) stars .",
    "the existence of a spheroid in m33 has been controversial for decades .",
    "while the galaxy does not appear to have a bulge , it definitely possesses a halo .",
    "i discuss these components in turn below .",
    "m33 apparently does not possess a bulge in the classical sense of that term @xcite , although this has been the subject of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "semantics aside , the galaxy hosts a small nucleus that can be fit with a bulge profile that dominates within @xmath00.1@xmath4 of the galaxy center @xcite . in a @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the brightest stars in the nucleus , @xcite find young , intermediate - age , and old stars with a mean metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath7 .",
    "it is not possible to obtain photometry of the low - mass ms stars in the nucleus with any observatory in operation or in development , so the constraints on the star formation history will be poor for the foreseeable future .",
    "the existence of a halo in m33 was also controversial in the past , such that the galaxy was sometimes referred to as a `` pure disk '' galaxy .",
    "however , in recent years a preponderance of evidence demonstrated beyond any doubt that m33 hosts a stellar halo .",
    "although some regions of the disk have _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ photometry reaching the stellar ms ( program 10190 ; pi garnett ) , the halo - dominated regions beyond the disk have not been imaged at sufficient depth , so the star formation history of the m33 halo remains poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite kinematically segregated the stellar clusters of m33 into disk and halo components .",
    "unresolved photometry and spectroscopy of the clusters enabled a rough age estimate that is prone to degeneracies between blue ms stars and blue hb stars .",
    "the young clusters in the sample have motions consistent with disk membership , but the old clusters show a much larger velocity dispersion , implying that 85% belong to the halo and 15% belong to the disk ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the clusters with halo kinematics have a spread in relative ages of 57  gyr , much greater than the globular cluster system in the milky way halo .",
    "subsequent photometry of one globular cluster in the sample was sufficiently deep to demonstrate that its blue spectrum is due to the presence of blue ms stars and not blue hb stars , proving its age is 58  gyr than the other globular clusters in their sample , but unfortunately the cluster can not be kinematically assigned to either the disk or halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a halo using 64 rr lyrae variables they identified in the galaxy .",
    "they estimated reddenings from their minimum @xmath8 colors and metallicities from their periods .",
    "the resulting distributions of reddening and metallicity imply they belong to two distinct populations , associated with the disk and halo , providing evidence for these components in the field that complements the evidence in clusters ( above ) .",
    "rr lyrae stars are only present in ancient ( @xmath310  gyr ) populations , implying that both the m33 disk and halo host at least some ancient stars . in the [ fe / h ]",
    "distribution for the halo rr lyrae stars , the peak is at @xmath9 , although the metallicities of the rr lyrae stars are not necessarily representative of the underlying population , because metallicity affects the hb temperature distribution and thus the fraction of hb stars falling in the instability strip .    @xcite also found evidence for a halo field population . from spectroscopy of 280 stars",
    ", they were able to segregate their sample into three components using both kinematics and metallicity : the halo , the disk , and a third unknown component possibly associated with a stellar stream .",
    "the halo component exhibits a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath10 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath050 km s@xmath11 , but the data provide no age constraints .    using star counts of rgb and agb stars along the minor axis",
    ", @xcite found a break in the surface brightness profile at 11  kpc , where the profile changes from that of an exponential disk to a power - law halo ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cmd of these bright stars implies the halo population is dominated by stars older than 3  gyr with a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath12 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the cmd of @xcite , who obtained @xmath13 and @xmath14 photometry in the halo outskirts and found a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath15 .",
    "the next logical step in the investigation of the m33 halo is deep photometry reaching its low - mass ms stars .",
    "this is the only way to unambiguously characterize the age distribution in the field population . while such photometry has been obtained in multiple regions of the m31 halo with _",
    "( discussed below ) , the m33 halo remains unexplored , with very loose constraints on its star formation history .",
    "while m31 certainly has both a bulge and a halo , the distinction between these components is somewhat muddled in the literature .",
    "historically , studies of the bulge and halo were driven by the appearance of m31 in wide - field shallow imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with `` bulge '' studies generally focusing on the region within a kpc of the center , and `` halo '' studies focusing on regions beyond 10  kpc on the minor axis .",
    "however , subsequent studies showed that the spheroid looks like a bulge out to @xmath020  kpc in both its surface - brightness profile @xcite and metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "it was only recently discovered that the surface - brightness profile transitions to a power - law @xcite and the metallicity drops by @xmath01 dex @xcite beyond 20  kpc , as expected for a halo .",
    "for consistency with historical studies , i will refer to all regions beyond 10  kpc on the minor axis as `` halo '' despite the persistence of some bulge - like properties out to 20  kpc .",
    "two fields in the m31 bulge were recently imaged in the near - ir at high resolution using adaptive optics on gemini north @xcite , resolving the upper 45  mag of the rgb and agb .",
    "the resulting @xmath16 and @xmath5 cmds are consistent with a population dominated by stars at an age of @xmath010  gyr , with a metallicity near solar , although the best - fit models include a minority intermediate - age component that may be spurious @xcite . as with the center of m33 ,",
    "no observatory in operation or development is capable of obtaining the detailed star formation history of the m31 bulge , because crowding precludes photometry of the low - mass ms stars .",
    "until the past decade , studies of the resolved stellar populations in the m31 halo generally focused on the metallicity distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity distributions were usually fit by assuming an old age ( @xmath310  gyr ) and then comparing the stars on the agb and rgb to isochrones or globular cluster templates , although some studies were deep enough to reach the hb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the rgb , agb , and hb distributions are , in principle , sensitive to age in broad age bins ( as noted above ) , several factors prevented these studies from exploring the age distribution , including photometric scatter , insufficient star counts , and contamination from foreground milky way dwarfs .    when the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was installed on _ hst _ in 2002 , it became possible to obtain photometry of low - mass ms stars in the m31 halo , enabling the exploration of both the metallicity and age distributions .",
    "@xcite imaged a field 11  kpc from the nucleus on the southeast minor axis , obtaining photometry of 250,000 stars down to @xmath17  mag in bands similar to @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( figure 2 ) . by providing a large number of stars with small photometric errors on the low - mass ms ,",
    "the catalog was immune to contamination from foreground milky way dwarfs .",
    "the resulting fit to the cmd found a wide age range in addition to the wide metallicity range that was already known , and speculated that this was due to a significant merger or series of smaller mergers in the galaxy . in the best - fit model @xcite , @xmath040% of the stars",
    "are younger than 10  gyr and more metal - rich than 47  tuc ( [ fe / h ]  =  0.7 ) , with significant numbers of stars down to ages of 2  gyr .",
    "besides the field population , there is evidence from integrated colors and spectroscopy that the m31 globular cluster system also extends to intermediate ages @xcite .",
    "the recent wide - field imaging surveys of m31 clearly show that it has undergone a violent merger history @xcite , including a giant stellar stream resulting from the tidal debris of a recent merger event @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies demonstrated that the inner spheroid of m31 ( within @xmath015  kpc ) is polluted by material stripped from progenitor satellite of the giant stellar stream .",
    "this evidence includes n - body simulations of the satellite disruption that reproduce the morphology of the major substructures in the galaxy @xcite , kinematical surveys that confirm the motions in the n - body simulations @xcite , and followup acs imaging of the giant stellar stream that shows strong similarities between the star formation histories of the stream and inner spheroid ( figure 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the discovery that the m31 halo becomes more like a halo beyond 20  kpc , a subsequent acs survey explored regions on the minor axis further out , at 21  kpc ( in the transition region ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 35  kpc ( where the spheroid clearly exhibits a halo surface brightness profile and metallicity ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to the field at 11  kpc , these fields host far fewer stars at ages younger than 8  gyr , but the populations clearly do not represent a classical halo formed via monolithic collapse at early times ( figure 2 ) ; in the best - fit model , @xmath030% of the stars are younger than 10  gyr , and only @xmath010% of the stars are ancient ( @xmath1812 gyr ) and metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath191.5 ) .",
    "all regions of the halo explored to date are consistent with a history whereby the galaxy forms over a prolonged period of hierarchical merging .",
    "m33 possesses a halo but not a traditional bulge .",
    "this halo exhibits secondary evidence for intermediate - age populations , such as a halo globular cluster system spanning a wide age range in integrated spectroscopy @xcite , but the age distribution in the m33 halo has not been constrained via photometry of the low - mass ms stars , as done in m31 .",
    "thus , our understanding of the star formation history in the m33 halo is in a state similar to that found in m31 prior to the advent of the _ hst _ acs . for years",
    ", m31 was assumed to host an old halo of age @xmath310  gyr .",
    "the m31 halo has now been probed in multiple locations along the minor axis , spanning the regions where the halo looks more like a bulge and where it looks more like a traditional halo , but in all of these regions it exhibits an extended star formation history @xcite .",
    "the m33 halo remains the last spiral galaxy halo unexplored via photometry of its low - mass ms stars , leaving its star formation history poorly constrained .",
    "appropriately deep imaging of the m33 halo should be obtained during the remaining _ hst _ mission , or it may be many years before such data can be obtained again .",
