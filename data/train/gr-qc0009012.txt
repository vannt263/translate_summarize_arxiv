    "within the next several years five kilometer - scale interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( geo  @xcite , ligo  @xcite and virgo  @xcite ) will begin searching for astronomical sources of gravitational waves , something the smaller tama  @xcite prototype detector has already begun .",
    "the fundamental limitation on the sensitivity of these terrestrial detectors is seismic noise at low frequencies , thermal excitations of the mirror substrates and their suspensions at intermediate frequencies , and laser shot noise at higher frequencies .",
    "here we focus on that part of the suspension noise associated with the _ violin modes _ of the suspension wires .",
    "gravitational waves interact with interferometric detectors by changing the separation , and thus the round - trip light travel time , between the mirrors in the detector arms . in order to be sensitive to passing gravitational radiation , the mirrors in terrestrial interferometeric detectors",
    "are suspended as pendula in order that they be approximately inertially free above the pendulumn frequency .",
    "nevertheless , thermal and other excitations of the suspension wires move the mirrors and lead to ( narrow - band ) data stream artifacts , located at the violin - mode resonance frequencies of the suspension wires .",
    "these narrow - band features , which stand some 4060  db above the shot noise background in the ligo  i detector , are signals themselves that , unless properly treated , can confound efforts to detect actual gravitational wave signals .    in the waveband of the detectors now under development the transfer function , which determines how the detector output at a particular frequency is related to incident radiation at that frequency , is constant .",
    "the time evolution of the signal arising from any incident gravitational waves is thus determined solely by the waves themselves .",
    "the time evolution of the signal arising from suspension violin mode excitations , on the other hand , is strongly influenced by the the dynamics of the modes .",
    "we make use of that distinction to design a kalman filter  @xcite that can , in real - time , detect violin mode excitations  thermal or otherwise  as distinct from actual gravitational wave signals . the measured excitation can be used to subtractively remove the modes from the detector output , significantly reducing the rms detector noise and simplifying the down - stream analysis .",
    "additionally , these measured excitations can be used to diagnose the instrument s behavior .",
    "other techniques have been described for the identification and removal of resonant line features in gravitational wave detector data . in particular ,",
    "sintes and schutz @xcite have discussed methods suitable for addressing nearly periodic artifacts that appear in a range of harmonics and whose phases , in each harmonic , are linearly related .",
    "these methods are not suitable for isolating the violin modes , however : though a full spectrum of violin mode harmonics do appear in the detector output , these modes are all independent and independently excited .",
    "allen and ottewill @xcite have applied the multi - taper spectral method of lees and park@xcite to estimate the contributions of these resonant features to the power spectrum .",
    "this non - parametric method does not and can not provide a time - domain estimate of the mode state or its instantaneous contribution to the detector output and so can not be used for conditioning the data prior to analysis .    in section  [ sec : kfilter ]",
    "we summarize the theory of kalman filtering , laying the ground for its application to identifying gravitational wave detector suspension violin modes .",
    "the construction of the kalman filter for a particular problem requires a dynamical model for the underlying physical process giving rise to the signal .",
    "we discuss our model and how it comes to be represented as a set of state - space difference equations on the physical observables . in section  [ sec : investigation ] we investigate the performance of the filter using both simulated data sets , whose `` signal '' and `` noise '' content is known exactly , and experimental data taken at the ligo  40  m prototype detector during november 1994 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a kalman filter is a mechanism for predicting the multi - dimensional _ state _ of a dynamical system from a multi - dimensional _ observable . _",
    "the observable is assumed to be linearly related to the system s state , which is assumed to evolve linearly with time .",
    "the observable is assumed to be contaminated by an additive gaussian _ measurement noise _ of known co - variance .",
    "the dynamical system described by the state may be driven by a known input in addition to gaussian _ process noise _ of known co - variance .",
    "for example , the system may be a pendulum , the state may be the pendulum bob s instantaneous position and momentum , and the observable may be the bob s position .",
    "the process noise is the thermal fluctuation in the wire and the measurement noise in this case may be the photon shot noise background .    when the process and measurement noise are normal ( _ i.e. , _ gaussian ) the kalman filter gives the optimal estimate of the system s state , in the least - squares sense . when the noise is more complex than gaussian the kalman filter gives the best estimate of the state assuming that only the second order statistical characterization of the noise is known . alternatively ,",
    "when the evolution equations are not linear or the observables are not related linearly to the state , then the kalman filter has a natural generalization that makes it the optimal means of predicting the state from the observables in a least - squares sense @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the kalman filter equations is straightforward and instructive . in the particular application",

    "we expect that the continuously updated mode amplitude and phase estimates as a function of time , either analyzed directly or displayed in a strip chart of which the top two panels of figure  [ fig : sim1c ] may be considered a snapshot , will be particularly useful for monitoring the state of the detector .      in deriving the kalman filter we assumed that the process and measurement noise were white ; however , we never required that they be gaussian . here",
    "we investigate the effectiveness of the filter when these noises are non - gaussian and when there are several modes present , at least two of which are very close together in frequency .",
    "this is a critical application , since in actual data there are multiple closely spaced violin modes resulting from several suspension wires of the mirrors , which can not be estimated separately ( cf .",

    "correlated process noise leads to correlations in the states of the individual modes . even in the absence of an explicit correlation in the assumed process noise covariance ( _ i.e. , _ off - diagonal terms in @xmath9 )",
    ", the filter will , if warranted by the observations , correlate the state estimates . lacking knowledge of the driving noise ( beyond contact with independent thermal baths ) , assuming that the process noise is uncorrelated guarantees that there is no prejudice that the mode states are correlated without constraining the state estimates to be uncorrelated .",
    "to evaluate the effectiveness of the kalman filter in treating multiple modes driven by non - normal noise , we applied a single kalman filter to this three mode system , choosing @xmath188 equal to 578.6  hz and @xmath72 equal to 18  hz . the top panel of figure [ fig : mixsub ] shows the power spectral density of the simulated gravity wave channel in a 60  hz bandwidth about the carrier frequency @xmath188 , while the bottom panel shows the power spectral density of the residual difference between the simulated observation and the filter s prediction of the contribution from the violin modes .",
    "the residual broad feature that remains following the subtraction of the mode estimate is due to the non - gaussian nature of the process noise that drives the mode .",

    ", however , the variance provides a very incomplete picture of the process noise .",
    "still , the filter has clearly identified approximately 45  db of the approximately 55  db of the mode contribution to the measurement .",

    "the two modes are known to be uncorrelated ; consequently , we expect that the state estimates should also be uncorrelated , which we have found to be the case .      to evaluate the effectiveness of the kalman filter in estimating the filter state in the presence of a transient excitation , we have simulated a single mode observed in the presence of the same mixture - gaussian measurement noise described above ( cf .  equation [ eq : ex2ngparms ] ) .",

    "there is , not surprisingly , a sudden increase in the error at the moment of the excitation ; however , the filter quickly adjusts to the new state .",
    "sudden excitations in the observed time series may arise from sources other than excitations of the violin modes . to evaluate the effectiveness of the kalman filter in discriminating between excitations of the mode and measurement noise transients we simulate a single line , driven by gaussian noise . this mode is embedded in the same mixture - gaussian measurement noise as described in section [ sec : case2 ] , but with a pulse in the measurement noise 14 seconds into the simulation .",
    "the pulse lasts for a single sample and has an amplitude of @xmath203 , where @xmath204 rms amplitude of the measurement noise .",

    "[ eq : delta ] ) , measuring the magnitude of the difference in the estimated and actual mode state ; the upper panel shows the estimated state itself .",
    "the error in the mode state estimate always remains quite small , showing that the filter discriminates between excitations of the modes and excitations in the measurement noise .",
    "the kalman filter described here is able to correctly determine instantaneous state of the violin mode suspensions .",
    "this is true whether the mode is driven by , or observed in the presence of , gaussian or non - gaussian noise .",
    "the filter does not require that the measurement or process noise be stationary : it correctly tracks the mode after it has been impulsively excited and can distinguish between excitations of the mode and transients in the measurement noise .",
    "in this section we discuss the application of the kalman filter to data taken at the ligo  40  m prototype detector during november 1994 .",
    "the general parameters of this run are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the particular results presented here all refer to the particular locked segment beginning at gps time 469357019  s on 19 november 1994 and lasting for 2665.54496  s.      at the time of the november 1994 data run each of the four cavity mirrors in the 40  m prototype was suspended by four cylindrical wires .",
    "setting aside the coupling of the wires through their attachment to the suspended mirror there are two fundamental modes associated with each wire : one with motion nominally along the optical axis and one with motion perpendicular to that axis . owing to imperfections in the wires , the attachments of the wires to the test masses , and",
    "the coupling of the modes through the motion of the mass all the modes will have some component along the optical axis .",
    "we thus expect 32 fundamental violin modes .",
    "a high resolution power spectrum focused on the bandwidth ( 570  hz , 606  hz ) and taken of the data from a single locked - segment ( _ i.e. , _ a single epoch during which the interferometer operated without interruption as a gravitational wave detector ) of 44  m duration shows 28 distinct resonant features .",
    "one of these is clearly identified as the ninth harmonic of the 60  hz power - main , leaving 27 different modes whose frequencies and quality factors are listed in table [ tbl : lines ] .    referring to table [ tbl : lines ]",
    "note that , apart from modes 7 , 16 , 19 , 24 , and 25 , the lines appear in pairs , with a high amplitude line closely associated with a lower amplitude line at a slightly higher frequency ( less than or of order 0.2  hz ) .",
    "this association of lines is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : sat1 ] .",
    "of the five apparently unpaired lines , three show companions in a high resolution power spectrum taken in the band of the first harmonic , suggesting that all five of the `` missing modes '' may be so closely spaced in frequency with other , identified modes , that we are unable to resolve them .      using the techniques described in section [ sec : model ] we have applied a kalman filter designed to track the 27 violin modes identified in table [ tbl : lines ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig:40power ] shows the power spectrum of the ifo_dmro ( interferometer differential mode read - out , or `` gravity wave '' ) channel in the 45  hz band beginning at 565.0 hz , with the violin modes clearly present .",
    "the bottom panel shows the power spectrum of the residual after the modes identified by the filter have been subtractively removed .",
    "very little power associated with these modes remains .",
    "figure [ fig:40power ] also shows an overall approximately 2  db reduction in the background noise level within the band , which is due to the `` wings '' of the predicted contribution of the violin modes to the total noise . our experience with simulated data ( cf .",
    "[ sec : case1][sec : case4 ] ) shows that the filter generally makes fractional prediction errors whose magnitude is on order 1% and that , as we have implemented the filter , this error tends to systematically over - estimate the contribution of the mode wings to the total noise .",
    "this is consistent with spectrum of the residual found here .",
    "the kalman filter provides us with a decomposition of the observation into the contributions from the individual violin modes and a residual , which is , in a least - squares sense , as free from the influence of the modes as we can make it .",
    "the noise character of the violin modes , which are instrumental artifacts , can thus be studied separately from the noise character of the residual .",
    "figure  [ fig:40expstat ] shows in histogram form the frequency with which samples of given amplitude ( normalized by rms amplitude ) appear in the @xmath205 bandwidth of the original data ( `` raw '' ) , in the contribution to this band from the modes as identified by the kalman filter , and in the residual difference between the raw data stream and the estimated contribution from the modes . if the detector noise were strictly gaussian the distribution of squared - amplitudes ( normalized by the mean - squared amplitude ) would follow an exponential distribution and the resulting curves would be , on the semi - log graph as shown , a straight lines with slope @xmath206 .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath207 for each histogram , using the left - most 47 bins shown in figure [ fig:40expstat ] and with the remainder of the data bins collapsed into a single additional bin , so that no bin has fewer than 40 events .",
    "the same binning was used for all three @xmath207 statistic evaluations .",
    "table [ tbl : chi2 ] gives the resulting @xmath207 , the number of degrees of freedom , and the corresponding @xmath208-value .    referring to table [ tbl : chi2 ] we see that the kalman filter has resolved the total noise in this band into two components that have very different noise character . while in all cases",
    "the statistical character of the noise is far from gaussian , the contribution identified as arising from the violin modes is much better behaved ( _ i.e. , _ much closer to gaussian ) than the residual . the close correspondence between the @xmath207 for the `` raw '' data and the identified violin mode contribution reflects the fact that the violin mode contribution , even while it is narrow - band , is of such great amplitude that it dominates the total detector noise in this band .",
    "recalling our earlier results ( cf .",
    "[ sec : case3 ] and [ sec : case4 ] ) , which show how the kalman filter is able to discriminate correctly between excitations of the modes and impulses in the measurement noise , we conclude that the difference in the noise character is real and that , in the ligo  40  m , the violin mode contribution to the overall noise has many fewer outliers than the non - mode background . since , in a real detector , it is the residual that will contain the gravitational wave signal , the importance of removing instrumental artifacts like the violin modes in order to discover the noise character of the residual can not be overstated .",
    "a still closer examination , focusing on the contributions from the individual modes , shows that certain modes have much greater excess noise than others .",
    "figure  [ fig : indstat1][fig : indstat3 ] shows , for twelve different violin modes , the frequency distribution of mode amplitudes .",
    "all of the modes shown here have a strong excess of high amplitude noise events : _ i.e. , _ they are subject to strong , non - thermal forces .",
    "violin modes of the test mass suspensions are a significant instrumental artifact in the signal band of modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors : at the mode resonant frequencies they stand between 40 and 50  db above the ambient noise floor .",
    "these modes are not excited or otherwise disturbed by the passage of a gravitational wave ; yet , they contribute almost all of the noise power in a wide bandwidth . correspondingly , the ability to identify and remove their contribution to the detector noise and characterize the residual noise can significantly increase the detector s sensitivity in the affected wave - band .    treating the modes as a stochastic signal in a measurement noise background we have developed and demonstrated the use of a kalman filter for identifying the state of the suspension wires and the contribution of the violin modes to the detector noise .",
    "a kalman filter uses the known dynamics of the process that underlies a noise component ( in this case the stochastic excitation of the suspension violin modes ) to identify that component s contribution to total system noise from measurements made on the total noise alone . when the stochastic driving force is normal ( _ i.e. , _ gaussian ) the kalman filter is optimal in the least squares sense .",
    "when the process noise is non - gaussian , the kalman filter estimate is optimal when only the second order statistics of the noise ( _ i.e. , _ its power spectrum ) is known .",
    "using simulated data , whose mode and measurement noise contribution is known exactly , we have shown that the filter works well in the presence of both gaussian and non - gaussian measurement noise and excitations of the violin modes .",
    "we have also shown that the filter easily discriminates between transients in the measurement noise and transient excitations of the violin modes themselves , capturing the latter in its estimate of the mode state while rejecting the former as not arising from excitation of the mode . using data taken at the ligo  40  m",
    "we have demonstrated the use of the filter by isolating and subtractively removing the noise owing to 27 distinct violin modes , each standing between 40 and 50  db above the ambient noise floor , over an approximately 40  hz bandwidth .",
    "the kalman filter describes here operates in the time domain , providing instantaneous estimates of the suspension violin modes states .",
    "the computational cost is negligible , making it suitable for use as an on - line diagnostic as well as for on- or off - line data analysis .",
    "thermal and other excitations of the violin modes dominate the detector noise over a wide band .",
    "this additive contribution to the detector output will never include any gravitational wave signal , however . separating the mode contribution from the total noise",
    "dramatically increases the detector s sensitivity by significantly reducing the mean - square noise amplitude .",
    "it also , however , reveals a new `` layer '' of non - gaussian and transient noise that must be characterized and , where possible , removed through its association with other instrumental and physical environment monitors . using the kalman filter to separate the total noise into a violin mode contribution and a residual",
    "we find that , in the ligo  40  m prototype , the noise owing to the violin modes is much `` cleaner '' ( _ i.e. , _ much closer to normal ) than the residual noise , which is strongly leptokurtic . since , in a real detector , it is the residual that will contain the gravitational wave signal , the importance of removing instrumental artifacts like the violin modes in order to discover the noise character of the residual can not be overstated . as we dig deeper into the detector noise the challenges of identifying the origin of the newly uncovered noise components",
    "becomes greater ; however , this is a challenge that must be faced and overcome if we are to make the most of the opportunities provided by the these new detectors .",
