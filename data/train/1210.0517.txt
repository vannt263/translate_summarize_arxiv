    "each multilayer was deposited on ion - cleaned si / sio@xmath13 substrates , with buffer layers of ta(5nm)/cu(3 nm ) to promote ( 111 ) fiber texture@xcite , and was capped with py(5nm)/cu(3nm)/ta(5 nm ) .",

    "the samples were mounted in a vacuum chamber inserted between poles of an electromagnet generating a magnetic field of 0.6 t. the incident x - ray beam was parallel / antiparallel to the direction of applied magnetic field , while the angle of incidence at the sample was @xmath2615@xmath29 .",

    "the so - called magneto - optical sum rules@xcite were applied to the normalized xmcd spectra , using    @xmath32    and @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the integrated xmcd intensities at the @xmath31 and @xmath30 edges , respectively , @xmath36 is the number of holes in the pd @xmath8 bands , @xmath37 is the total absorption cross - section corresponding to @xmath38 transitions , and @xmath39 is the expectation value of the spin magnetic dipole operator . in the analysis ,",

    "an pd xmcd signal is clearly present in the py / cu / pd superlattice , roughly 3% in magnitude that observed for pd in the py / pd superlattice .",
    "it is also apparent in the spectra that the relative weights of the pd @xmath30 xmcd and the pd @xmath31 xmcd are reduced and increased , respectively , through addition of the 3 nm cu spacers .",

    "we regard this to be a real effect , due to changes in the @xmath45band occupation in the multilayer .",
    "second , there are spectral features at 3187 and 3345 ev in the xmcd , corresponding to the first exafs wiggles in the corresponding absorption spectra .",

    "the greater spin - type component is consistent with rkky - type exchange through cu , which possesses induced spin moments with negligible orbital components@xcite , acting on pd .",

    "qiu et al@xcite determined an interfacial exchange coupling parameter of @xmath69 from magnetooptical kerr effect ( moke ) measurements of wedged trilayers , or a saturation field of @xmath26 80 g , after the second antiferromagnetic maximum .    in our experiment , the interfacial interlayer exchange coupling creates a magnetic moment in pd , rather than simply shifting its saturation field .",
    "we will infer an exchange energy from the induced moment assuming the bulk paramagnetic susceptibility of pd .",
    "the induced moment @xmath70 from an exchange energy splitting @xmath71 is @xmath72 , where @xmath5 is the stoner factor , @xmath11 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath73 is the density of states at the fermi energy of pd .",
    "we estimate the total iec exchange energy acting on the pd , to generate the moment , as    @xmath74    we find that the moment induced through indirect exchange is significantly larger than that expected from interlayer exchange coupling and the bulk paramagnetic susceptibility . taking the observed @xmath75 , @xmath76@xcite , and the bulk @xmath77 gives @xmath78 .",
    "an atomic volume of @xmath79 can be applied to estimate the interfacial exchange coupling by @xmath80 , given an assumed value of @xmath5 .",
    "note that the estimate of @xmath23 would not change if we assumed that the pd magnetic moment is generated only in a few interface layers : the experimental moment @xmath81 and the conversion @xmath82 would change by the same proportionality .    in the experiment , we can probe only the @xmath83 product . assuming the bulk paramagnetic susceptibility enhancement factor @xmath5 , the interfacial indirect exchange coupling energy , @xmath84 , will be two orders of magnitude ( 215 x ) stronger than that seen in @xcite for epitaxial co / cu / co(001 ) at 3 nm cu thickness ( @xmath260.02 erg/@xmath85 ) .",
    "alternatively , assuming an identical value of exchange coupling yields an estimate of susceptibility enhancement factor @xmath86 , two orders of magnitude above the bulk susceptibility .",
    "fe@xmath2(10nm)/cu(3nm)/pd(10nm)/al(3 nm ) . ]",
    "previously , ir magnetic moments of @xmath26 0.01 @xmath57 have been observed in a [ co(0.4)/ pt(1.1)/ ir(0.8)/ pt(1.1nm)]@xmath87 heterostructure@xcite .",
    "this is an `` existence proof '' that magnetic order can be induced in one bulk paramagnet through another bulk paramagnet .",
    "however , adjusted for thickness , the induced ir moment is significantly weaker than our observation for pd in [ py(5nm)/ cu(3nm)/ pd(2.5nm)/ cu(3nm)]@xmath3 : the moment - pd ( -ir ) thickness product is comparable , and a variation as @xmath88 would reduce the ir moment by an order of magnitude at 3 nm .",
    "moreover , the mechanism may be different , as it is also less clear that the induced ir moment relates to rkky through the pt , given the absence of oscillatory coupling seen in co / pt.@xcite    a possible interpretation for the large exchange coupling @xmath23 in the py / cu / pd structure is that the measured value is dominated by direct contact of py and pd through discontinuities ( `` pinholes '' ) in the 3 nm cu layers .",
    "however , we do not believe that this is likely .",
    "first , a cross - sectional tem image ( figure [ fig3 ] ) for a single , thicker pd(10 nm ) layer , seeded similarly , shows continuous coverage , with cu / pd interface roughness conformal with the top surface roughness .",
    "this reproduces findings of older tem investigations which show conformal coverage of pd or pt in multiple - repeat ( x20 ) heterostructures with pd as thin as 1 nm@xcite .",
    "second , ferromagnetic coupling between identically seeded @xmath89/cu(3nm)/@xmath90 structures is @xmath27 20 oe for 8 nm co layers in ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr)@xcite ; this places an upper bound of @xmath91 , likely dominated by dipolar ( neel ) coupling .",
    "third , direct exchange would require that roughly one pd atom out of 30 is in direct contact with the py layer ; given the thickness of the cu layer , @xmath26 15 monolayers , this is an unrealistically large value .",
    "finally , the xmcd shape ( l / s ratio ) is quite different for the py / pd and py / cu / pd structures .",
    "this signal is sensitive to only the magnetically active pd atoms in the structure .",
    "the lower orbital moment component observed for the py / cu / pd structure is consistent with ( spin - mediated ) indirect exchange through cu .",
    "finally , we note that dramatically enhanced susceptibilities @xmath5 have been reported for ultrathin pd before .",
    "brodsky and freeman@xcite observed susceptibility enhancements up to a factor of 500 over bulk values in au / pd / au , attributed to lattice distortion of the ultrathin pd .",
    "there was some discussion in this work regarding a possible role of fe impurities or entrapped o@xmath13 . in our experiments ,",
    "the xmcd technique provides confidence that the enhanced moments are located on pd sites .",
    "we have shown that pd , with its greatest tendency towards ferromagnetism of all paramagnets , can have significant magnetic order induced through long - range indirect exchange through 3 nm of cu . estimated values for the exchange coupling strength between ferromagnetic permalloy ( py ) and pd",
    "are two orders of magnitude larger than those found in the co / cu / co system .",
    "our results have some implications for the understanding of damping enhancement through spin pumping , or dynamic exchange coupling@xcite .",
    "static and dynamic interlayer exchange couplings are not typically calculated on equal footing . widely used models for the damping enhancement@xcite assume that electron momenta are randomized at the interfaces .",
    "this implicitly assumes near - zero static exchange coupling , justified to date because the cu thicknesses typically investigated in spin pumping studies , @xmath28 3 nm , are beyond the range where rkky is strong , and since no rkky mechanism has been obvious in heterostructures of f / cu/@xmath92 `` spin sink '' metals .",
    "our experimental results call both these assumptions into question for f / cu / pd : the rkky mechanism is evidently nonnegligible at 3 nm and stronger than expected from studies with two f layers .",
    "it is possible that where the iec is strong , it has a measurable effect on the damping enhancement @xmath93 : costa et al@xcite predict that a component of @xmath93nearly half the asymptotic value for co / cu / co(100 ) , for @xmath94 of a few monolayers  does indeed oscillate with the same period as the iec . because of the complicated nature of the fmr spectra for",
    "strongly coupled f layers , it has been difficult to investigate the predicted behavior .",
    "our results suggest that the py / cu / pd system , with a single fmr mode but evidently strong coupling , is suitable for studies of the interplay between static and dynamic coupling .",
