    "<S> we are interested in ( uniformly ) parabolic pdes with a nonlinear dependance of the leading - order coefficients , driven by a rough right hand side . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a space - time periodic setting with a single spatial variable : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the projection on mean - zero functions , and @xmath2 is a distribution and only controlled in the low regularity norm of @xmath3 for @xmath4 on the parabolic hlder scale . </S>",
    "<S> the example we have in mind is a random forcing @xmath2 and our assumptions allow , for example , for an @xmath2 which is white in the time variable @xmath5 and only mildly coloured in the space variable @xmath6 ; any spatial covariance operator @xmath7 with @xmath8 is admissible .    on the deterministic side </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a @xmath9-estimate for @xmath10 , assuming that we control products of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 solving the constant - coefficient equation @xmath14 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain existence , uniqueness and stability with respect to @xmath15 of small space - time periodic solutions for small data . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate how the required products can be bounded in the case of a random forcing @xmath2 using stochastic arguments .    for this we extend the treatment of the singular product @xmath16 via a space - time version of gubinelli s notion of controlled rough paths to the product @xmath17 , which has the same degree of singularity but is more nonlinear since the solution @xmath10 appears in both factors . </S>",
    "<S> the pde ingredient mimics the ( kernel - free ) krylov - safanov approach to ordinary schauder theory . </S>"
