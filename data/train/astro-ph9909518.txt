    "the analysis of the distribution of dark matter in clusters of galaxies provides an important insight into the history of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the epoch of formation of clusters and their evolution with redshift are dependent on cosmological parameters and the nature of ( dark ) matter .",
    "for example , the existence of even a few massive clusters at redshift z = 1 would be a strong pointer to a low-@xmath7 universes .    in order to follow the cosmic history of clusters with look - back time ,",
    "it is important to have reliable tools at hand to study the nature of matter ( the mass , its distribution , the fraction of baryonic and non - baryonic matter etc ) .",
    "gravitational lensing and bremsstrahlung emission from hot intra - cluster gas are two processes which help us probe these issues .",
    "unfortunately , the results from these two approaches have not yet provided a mutually consistent picture .",
    "indeed , x - ray mass estimates show discrepancies with weak and strong lensing mass estimates of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is not yet fully understood ( see mellier 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the total mass inferred from lensing exceeds the x - ray mass by a factor of about two for some clusters including well studied clusters like a2218 ( miralda - escud & babul 1995 ) .",
    "investigations of a dozen clusters by smail et al ( 1997 ) , allen ( 1998 ) or lewis et al ( 1999 ) have not illuminated the reasons for the discrepancy . in an attempt to solve the problem , allen ( 1998 ) compared cooling flow and non - cooling flow clusters and observed that the former do not show the mass discrepancy .",
    "this result suggests that the assumptions regarding the dynamical and thermal state of the hot intra - cluster gas , a key ingredient for the x - ray mass estimate , are not realistic enough to result in a satisfactory model of non - cooling flow ( i.e. presumably non - relaxed ) clusters of galaxies .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by bhringer et al ( 1998 ) who found an excellent agreement between the x - ray , the strong and the weak lensing analyses of the relaxed cluster a2390 .",
    "however , lewis et al ( 1999 ) did not find similar trends in their cluster sample .",
    "they argue that even some cooling flow clusters show significant discrepancies between x - ray and lensing mass , particularly with strong lensing estimates .",
    "it is likely that this mass discrepancy is the result of several other less - than - valid assumptions .",
    "for example , the comparison between x - ray and weak gravitational lensing is done by extrapolating the best fit of the x - ray profile far beyond the region where data are reliable , where uncertainties are obviously significant and the shape of the ( assumed ) analytical profile used for extrapolation also has a considerable impact on the mass estimate ( lewis et al , 1999 ; bhringer et al , 1999 ) .",
    "lensing mass estimates are not free from bias either .",
    "n - body simulations by cen ( 1997 ) and metzler ( 1999 ) show that projection effects of in - falling filaments of matter towards the cluster centre can significantly bias the projected mass density inferred from weak lensing analysis to values higher than from x - ray .",
    "the amplitude of the bias seems to range between 10 and 20 per cent , but more generally , projection effects generated by any structures along the line of sight , can overestimate the total mass by about 30 per cent ( reblinsky & bartelmann 1999 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to explore ways which could improve the accuracy of the total mass estimate from lensing inversion algorithms in order to disentangle the systematics from random errors and to separate the contributions of gravitational lensing analyses to the discrepancy from those of the assumptions in the x - ray analyses .",
    "very deep observations of clusters of galaxies in multiple bands and with subarcsecond seeing can considerably improve the reliability of mass estimates from weak lensing ; the depth increases the number density of lensed galaxies thereby improving the resolution of the mass reconstruction ; multicolor observations allow estimation of photometric redshifts to be obtain the redshift distribution of background sources ; finally , subarcsecond seeing makes for a good determination of object shapes and accurate psf correction .",
    "rarely are all of these stringent requirements satisfied simultaneously in ground based observations .",
    "fortunately , the recent observations obtained during the science verification programme for the fors ( focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ; appenzeller et al 1998 ) and the isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ; moorwood et al 1999 ) instruments mounted on the first very large telescope , ut1/antu , provide an excellent dataset on the lensing cluster ms 1008 - 1224 .",
    "the images obtained at paranal have a seeing better than 0.7 arcsecond in b , v , r and i bands over a 6 arcminute field of view , as well as on the 2.5 arcminute field covering the central part of the cluster in j and k - bands .",
    "the quality and depth of these vlt images are therefore among the best data ever obtained from the ground for weak lensing mass reconstruction of a cluster .",
    "ms 1008 - 1224 is a galaxy cluster selected from the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( gioia & luppino 1994 ) .",
    "it is one of the 16 emss clusters observed by le fvre et al ( 1994 ) in which they found strong lensing features .",
    "the cluster is at redshift @xmath8 ( lewis et al , 1999 ) and is dominated by a cd galaxy .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath9(0.3 - 3.5 kev)=4.5 @xmath10 erg.s@xmath11 ( from lewis et al 1999 , with @xmath12=100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath13 ) and its temperature inferred from asca observation is @xmath14 kev ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "according to lewis et al ( 1999 ) , the x - ray contours are centered 15 arcseconds to the north of the cd and show a rather circular pattern outward with an extension towards the north .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations , the data analyses and some optical properties of the vlt images , including the description of some lensed features and magnified distant objects .",
    "the mass reconstructions , from weak shear analysis as well as from depletion produced by magnification bias , are presented in section 3 .",

    "the gravitational distortion pattern is obvious even on a casual inspection of the vlt images . together with the x - ray observations of lewis et al ( 1999 ) , these high quality multi - band images are well suited for a thorough analysis of the distribution of mass within the cluster .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed in a standard manner using the latest version of the release 2.1.0 of the sextractor software ( bertin & arnoults , 1996 ) which is publicly available on the terapix web site ( http://terapix.iap.fr/sextractor/ ) .",

    "the stars in the field were identified by their location on the magnitude - half - light radius plot ( see fahlman et al 1994 ) .",

    "unfortunately , from its morphology alone , it is not easy to identify the lens configuration .",
    "its shape and its position very close to the cd suggest that this is a radial arc , but its shape on none of the images shows a double structure which would convincingly demonstrate that it is composed of two merging parts of the same source .",
    "alternatively , it could be a tangential arc . in that case",
    ", its curvature indicates that the main deflector is to its north .",
    "this would imply that the cd is not located at the center of the potential well .",
    "further , an inspection of its image in different bands ( fig .",
    "[ arc4bvrijk ] ) shows that we can not even exclude that this simply comprises galaxies superimposed along the line of sight .",

    "unfortunately , an accurate calibration is not possible , unless a complete @xmath20 and @xmath21 photometric coverage of the total fors field provides the photometric redshifts of the galaxies with @xmath22 located far beyond the cluster centre .",
    "therefore , we can not expect better results from magnification bias than the gravitational shear ones until then .",
    "+ the mass from depletion has many sources of errors : poisson noise statistics on very low numbers and galaxy clustering which seems obvious from the bump observe between @xmath23 pixels , whose a fraction comes from a background lensed cluster at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , the zero - point looks a critical issue .",
    "the lower limit of the density of foregrounds seems rather well determined .",
    "the intersection of the depletion of the fors field is a good indication since this curve should have an inflexion because it can not decrease down to zero .",
    "this means that the value of the foreground has probably been minimized .",
    "if so , then the density of galaxies with redshift larger than 0.4 could be lowered .",
    "+ alternatively , the position of the background galaxy could be estimated by simply offsetting the depletion curve of @xmath22 galaxies in order to superimpose to the fors curve .",
    "a crude estimate of the offset , assuming @xmath25 is settled to 1 @xmath26 , leads to @xmath27 . as shown in table 2 ,",
    "this strongly lower the total mass .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with x - ray and virial analyses . from fig . 4 of lewis et al",
    ", we see that the mass inside one arc - minute inferred from the x - ray emissivity is @xmath28 , that is between 1.8 to 2.4 times lower than the shear analysis , @xmath29 .",
    "the depletion provides a marginally similar value if @xmath30 is lower than 2.4 , but is difficult to reconcile with the x - ray .",
    "the depletion approach is , however , not sufficiently reliable , since we can not accurately calibrate the zero - point of the photometric redshift sample .",
    "it is necessary to have near infrared data over the whole of the fors field for this purpose .    on larger scale , the agreement is better . @xmath31 and @xmath32 monotonically increase and reach @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 . at that radius , which is the limiting distance to which the x - ray data are reliable , the relative discrepancy is about 20% is within the errors .",
    "however , even if we assume that the 20% difference is constant beyond @xmath36 , the baryon fraction is not changed significantly with respect to the value quoted by lewis et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "it only decreases from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we have compared the mass profile inferred from the shear analysis to three models ( see fig .",
    "[ radialprofile ] ) : a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , an isothermal sphere with core radius and the `` universal profile '' ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) . a sis with velocity dispersion of @xmath39 km.sec@xmath11 fits the data marginally .",
    "the agreement is good at large distance , but the discrepancy is important close to the center . a better fit is obtained with an isothermal sphere with a core radius . using the parameters of the lens configuration ( namely the redshift of the lens and the photometric redshift of the lensed galaxies ) , the isothermal model with core radius can be expressed as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is expressed in arc - minutes , @xmath42 , @xmath43 the mass inside the radius @xmath44 and @xmath45 the three - dimension velocity dispersion at infinity .",
    "the best fit predicts @xmath39 km.sec@xmath11 ( as expected from the fit of a sis ) and @xmath46 kpc .",
    "this small value for @xmath41 is robust because it is constrained by the change of curvature of the mass profile at small radial distance which imposes an upper limit regardless of the mass at large radius .",
    "the presence of strong lensing features also indicates that matter is strongly concentrated at the centre and is consistent with the small core radius .",
    "the velocity dispersion is similar within the errors to the galaxy velocity dispersion obtained by carlberg et al ( 1996 ) who measured 1054 km.sec@xmath11 .",
    "this confirms that the method they used to measure the velocity dispersion , though it leads to somewhat lower values than previous works , is valid and gives a reliable estimator of the dynamical mass .",
    "the universal profile ( nfw ) fits the mass profile equally well .",
    "the nfw profile may be expressed for this cluster as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the dimensionless mass profile ( bartelmann 1996 ) and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the critical density . though both the isothermal sphere with core radius and the nfw profiles are within the error bars , the latter fits the data better . in particular on small and intermediate scales , the shape of the radial mass distribution is well reproduced by the nfw .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath52 kpc and @xmath53 .    fig .",
    "[ lightrelated ] shows the radial luminosity profile of the cluster galaxies ( selected from the colour - magnitude plot ) .",
    "the luminosity was computed assuming non - evolution models and by using a @xmath21-correction of elliptical / s0s galaxies for the whole sample .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since the galaxies selected with the color - magnitude diagram are mainly early - type systems and contains the brightest galaxies which contribute most of the luminosity of the cluster .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ lightrelated ] assumed a constant magnitude error of @xmath54 regardless the signal - to - noise of the individual galaxies .",
    "this conservative estimate makes allowance for the underestimation of the @xmath21correction for late - type galaxies of the sample .",
    "the @xmath21-corrections have been computed from the most recent bruzual & charlot models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "the light profile is remarkably linear .",
    "hoesktra et al ( 1998 ) found similar results in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the best fit to the profile gives a slope @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( that is , almost zero , as expected ) .",
    "assuming that the mass - to - light,@xmath57 ratio is constant over the field , this linear profile indicates that an isothermal sphere is an acceptable model for the lens at least up to a radial distance of 700 @xmath3 kpc .",
    "however , the profile of the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath58 , is more puzzling and does not bear this out .",
    "the integrated @xmath57 over the field is @xmath59 , in excellent agreement with the value of the cnoc analysis ( @xmath60 , carlberg et al 1996 ) .",
    "[ lightrelated ] shows its radial profile .",
    "the lines are the @xmath57 profiles computed from the best fit of the mass distributions ( isothermal models or nfw ) divided by the best fit of the light distribution ( straight line ) .",
    "clearly , the mass - to - light ratio depends on the radial distance . in the center",
    ", it is lower than the average , which expresses the dominating contribution of the cd galaxy to the total luminosity and the fact that this cd is much brighter than normal ellipticals . at large distance , the mass - to - light ratio seems to converge towards a constant value .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath58 is better reproduced by the nfw profile , basically because , if the light distribution increases linearly with radius , the @xmath57 of the nfw profile varies as @xmath61 which shows a maximum at intermediate scale .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath57 is really not constant with radius it would favor the nfw profile against the isothermal sphere .",
    "unfortunately , the error bars are large enough to be consistent with both the profiles .",
    "it is worth noting that both profiles underestimate the @xmath57 on intermediate scales .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy could be the clustering of sources .",
    "in particular , the second cluster at redshift 0.9 certainly increases the amplification and the gravitational shear of galaxies having a redshift larger than one and which are located inside the radius @xmath62 pixels ( one arc - minute ) .",
    "thus , all the galaxies beyond @xmath63 are magnified twice . from the depletion point of view",
    ", the most distant galaxies are deflected twice , which increases the depth and the angular size of the depleted area . from the gravitational shear point of view",
    ", the distant cluster also enhances the distortion that the weak lensing analysis mistakenly interprets as a strong gravitational effect of ms 1008 - 1224 .",
    "this could explain why the mass from the weak lensing analysis , and therefore the radial distribution of the mass - to - light ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ lightrelated ] , increase rapidly at small radius ( @xmath64 pixels ) despite a linear increase of the cluster luminosity .",
    "a similar effect is also discernable in the depletion which has a very steep growth curve .",
    "the discrepancy between x - ray and lensing mass only appears on small scales .",
    "but it is a factor of 2 , which is significantly lower than the factor 3.7 obtained by wu & fang ( 1997 ) from the analysis of strong lensing features .",
    "the decrease of the discrepancy with radius seems to be a general trend which has already been reported ( athreya et al 1999 , lewis 1999 , see mellier 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "it must be noted that in most of the studies the comparison has been done between x - ray and strong lensing features and not weak lensing analysis .    some of the discrepancy observed in ms 1008 - 1224 can be produced by the distant cluster we have discovered behind it by biasing the mass estimate for ms 1008 - 1224 towards a higher value .",
    "however , such a projection effect , similar to those discussed by reblinsky and bartelmann ( 1999 ) , can not explain a factor of 2 discrepancy because the distant cluster is only a tiny fraction of the lensed area .",
    "it is confined to just one quadrant of the isaac field , where , additionally , only background galaxies with redshift higher than 0.9 are magnified twice .",
    "the magnitude of its impact on the mass estimate is roughly the ratio @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fraction of lensed galaxies with redshift larger than @xmath67 and the factor 1/4 is the fraction of the isaac area covered by the cluster . using photometric redshifts",
    ", we estimate that this ratio is about 30 per cent , as predicted by reblinsky and bartelmann ( 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , as it is obvious from the mass reconstructions , though we see an extension westward of the mass map at the position of the cluster , no prominent clump of matter is visible and the distortion of the mass maps generated by this second lens seems rather weak .",
    "it is worth noting that apart from this distant cluster , contaminations by other projection effects are not visible at the center , where photometric redshifts provide a good idea of the clustering along the line of sight .",
    "the total area covered by isaac encompass the region where strong lensing features are visible , where the mass estimate from lensing exceeds the x - ray prediction .",
    "we find no evidence that biases like the ones proposed by cen ( 1997 ) or metzler ( 1999 ) are significant in the central region .",
    "in contrast , there is some evidence that the innermost regions of ms 1008 - 1224 is complex , which makes the modeling of the hot gas a difficult task .",
    "in particular , there is compelling evidence that the center of mass does not coincide exactly with the cd galxy :    * lewis et al ( 1999 ) reported an offset of the x - ray centroid about 15 arcseconds north of the cd galaxy .",
    "* the mass reconstructions show an offset of 15 arcseconds north and 15 arcseconds west for the low resolution mass maps , * the depletion area is offseted by 15 arcseconds north and 10 arcseconds west with respect to the cd .    while each of the above results are not highly significant in themselves , the fact that all of them independently point to the offset , and in fact in the same direction strongly suggests that the cd is not at the centroid of the mass distribution .",
    "as seen in our high resolution mass reconstruction , it may coincide with the lower subclump .",
    "the isoluminosity and number density contours clearly show that the light distribution is clumpy , in particular along the north direction , as in the mass maps .",
    "if those clumps overlap along the line of sight they will look like merging system by projection effect and the projected mass density produced by the weak lensing analysis will be centered on the projected centre of mass , if the resolution is too low to separate each component .",
    "in fact , the x - ray , the luminosity and the number density contours show elongated and clumpy filaments along the north direction which all indicate that ms 1008 - 1224 is still experiencing merging processes .",
    "if this assumption is valid , then the hot gas is not in equilibrium .",
    "the merging process produces shocks and gas flows between clumps , such as those seen in schindler & mller simulations ( 1993 ) or those reported by kneib et al ( 1996 ) and neumann & bhringer ( 1999 ) in the lensing cluster a2218 .",
    "athreya et al ( 1999 ) reported similar trends in a370 , with remarkable similarity with ms 1008 - 1224 : a good agreement with x - ray and weak lensing analysis on large scale and a discrepancy of a factor of 2 also in the inner region . since a370 is clearly composed of merging clumps , athreya et al also interpret the discrepancy as a result of an oversimplification of the physics of the hot gas .",
    "we then suspect that the x - ray analysis oversimplified the dynamical stage of the gas inside ms 1008 - 1224 , producing a wrong estimate of the mass and thus a discrepancy between the x - ray and the weak / strong lensing analysis .",
    "this , as suggested earlier by miralda - escud and babul ( 1995 ) , easily explains the good agreement on large scale between the weak lensing , the x - ray and also the virial mass ( see lewis et al 1999 ) and the apparent contradiction between x - ray and strong lensing .",
    "thanks to the deep multicolor subarcsecond images obtained with fors and isaac by the science verification team , it has been possible to map the mass distribution of the lensing cluster ms 1008 - 1224 , to evaluate the reliability of non - parametric reconstruction and to scale the mass carefully . the comparison between the mass map from weak lensing analysis , the x - ray reconstruction and the light distribution from optical data lead to several interesting insights .    *",
    "the weak lensing analysis of the fors data provide stable and reliable mass maps which look similar in b , v , r and i filters .",
    "this shows that the psf correction and the mass reconstruction algorithms work well . *",
    "good bvrijk photometry allowed for photometric redshift estimation which in turn allowed us to obtain the absolute mass from weak - lensing . * using the sample with photometric redshift , we discovered a very distant cluster of galaxies located behind ms 1008 - 1224 .",
    "this is the first observational evidence of cluster - cluster lensing . * unfortunately , this lensed cluster partly compromises the use of the depletion curve to estimate the mass of the cluster independent of the weak shear analysis .",
    "the slope of the growth curve shows irregularities produced by the excess of galaxies in the lensed clusters .",
    "this kind of clustering is is an intrinsic limitation of the practical usefulness of the magnification bias which has already been stressed by fort et al ( 1996 ) and hoesktra et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "* on a more optimistic view , ms1008 - 1224 can be used as a gravitational telescope in order to study the population of a cluster of galaxies at redshift one . thanks to the magnification",
    ", the number density contrast of the distant cluster increases and many more galaxies than the usual fraction visible in such distant clusters can be studied .",
    "we have not dwelt on this point since it is far beyond the scope of this work ; but a join multicolor and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster could be valuable . * on large scales , the total mass inferred from weak lensing is in good agreement with the x - ray analysis .",
    "in contrast , we still have a considerable discrepancy on small scales .",
    "the clumpiness of the light distribution , the elongated shape , the x - ray emissivity and the double peak mass contours are indications that the cluster is still in the throes of a merger .",
    "we therefore believe that the x - ray gas is not in equilibrium in the innermost part of the cluster and that this is the principal reason for the mass discrepancy .    in order to go",
    "further in the analysis of this cluster we need first a larger coverage of the fors field in the infrared",
    ". this will provide us photometric redshifts of galaxies beyond one arcminute from the cluster center and hence a better estimate of the zero point of the depletion curve",
    ". it would be also valuable to get hst images of the center in order to model the innermost regions using strong lensing features .",
    "this will provide with a better accuracy the cluster center and can be used to check if the contradiction between the x - ray and the lensing mass can be sorted out by a more accurate lensing model of the cluster center .",
    "photometric redshifts will be particularly helpful since they will provide the redshift of each arc(let ) .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to get the spectrum of the arc candidate # 4 .",
    "if confirmed as a gravitational arc , then its position and curvature would immediately imply that the center of mass of the cluster is not located on the cd galaxy .",
    "we believe that such a detailed weak - lensing analysis should be carried out on many clusters of galaxies with ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "however , the technical requirements for such an investigation are stringent .",
    "one must combine very deep observations , subarcsecond images and multicolor photometry , from the b - band up to the infrared k - band . the exceptional combination of fors and isaac on the vlt is the best tool available at present for such a project .",
    "it is only after doing similar investigations on a large sample of cluster , that we may be able to obtain a clear understanding of the amount and distribution of dark matter in clusters , understand the reasons behind the the x - ray / lensing mass discrepancy and in general to use weak lensing analysis of clusters as a reliable cosmological tool .",

    "<S> we present a gravitational lensing analysis of the cluster of galaxies ms 1008 - 1224 ( @xmath0 ) , based on very deep observations obtained using the vlt with fors and isaac during the science verification phase . </S>",
    "<S> + we reconstructed the projected mass distribution from the b , v , r and i band data using two different algorithms independently . </S>",
    "<S> the mass maps are remarkably similar , which confirmed that the psf correction worked well , thanks to the superb quality of the images . </S>",
    "<S> + the j and k band data ( isaac ) were combined with the bvri ( fors ) data to measure the photometric redshifts of galaxies inside the isaac field and to constrain the redshift distribution of the lensed sources . </S>",
    "<S> this enabled us to scale the gravitational convergence into an accurate mass estimate . </S>",
    "<S> + the total mass inferred from weak shear is 2.3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 m@xmath4 on large scales ( within @xmath5 @xmath3 kpc ) which is in good agreement with the x - ray mass . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - to - light ratios are also in excellent agreement ( 319@xmath6 , against 312@xmath6 from the x - ray ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured mass profile is well fit by both navarro , frenk and white and isothermal sphere with core radius models although the nfw appears to be slightly better . </S>",
    "<S> + in the inner regions , the lensing mass is about 2 times higher than the x - ray mass , which supports the long - held view that complex physical processes occuring in the innermost parts of lensing - clusters are responsible for the x - ray / lensing mass discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the central part of the cluster is composed of two mass peaks whose the center of mass is located 15 arcsecond north of the cd galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an explanation for the 15 arcsecond offset between the cd and the center of the x - ray map already reported elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> + the optical , x - ray and the mass distributions show that ms 1008 - 1224 is composed of many subsystems which are probably undergoing a merger . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the gas is not in equilibrium in the innermost regions which vitiates the x - ray mass estimate . </S>",
    "<S> + ms 1008 - 1224 shows a remarkable case of cluster - cluster lensing . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric redshifts show an excess of galaxies located 30 arcseconds south - west of the cd galaxy at a redshift of about 0.9 </S>",
    "<S> . this distant cluster is lensed by ms 1008 - 1224 , which enables the detection of many of its galaxies . hence , ms 1008 - 1224 can be viewed as a gravitational telescope facilitating the study of a distant cluster . + </S>",
    "<S> these results show that detailed investigations of lensing clusters require very deep imaging with sub - arcsecond seeing in multiple bands ( bvri and jk ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis demonstrates that a thorough investigation of clusters of galaxies and a careful handling of the biases can not be performed without a dataset which fulfills these requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the outstanding capabilities of the vlt at cerro paranal make it a unique tool which makes such studies possible .    </S>",
