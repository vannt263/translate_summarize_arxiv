    "in its first phase of operation ( years 19962001 ) , the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment has provided , among other important results , compelling evidence for atmospheric @xmath7 disappearance @xcite .",
    "this evidence , now firmly based on a high - statistics 92 kton - year exposure @xcite , has not only been corroborated by consistent indications in the macro @xcite and soudan  2 @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments , but has also been independently checked by the first long - baseline kek - to - kamioka ( k2k ) accelerator experiment @xcite , using sk as a target for @xmath7 s produced 250 km away with @xmath8  gev .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations , interpreted in terms of nonzero mass - mixing parameters ( @xmath9 ) in the @xmath0 channel , provide by far the best and most natural explanation for the observed @xmath7 disappearance @xcite .    in section 2 we review the phenomenological status of the standard oscillations in the @xmath0 channel , in the light of the latest sk atmospheric zenith distributions @xcite and of the first spectral results from the k2k experiment @xcite .    on the solar neutrino front",
    ", the chlorine @xcite , gallium @xcite , super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite solar neutrino experiments have convincingly established that the deficit of the observed solar @xmath10 flux with respect to expectations @xcite implies new neutrino physics .",
    "in particular , the charged and neutral current ( cc and nc ) data from sno have proven the occurrence of @xmath10 transitions into a different active state @xmath11 with a statistical significance greater than @xmath12 @xcite .    barring sterile neutrinos and nonstandard @xmath6 interactions ,",
    "such transitions can be naturally explained by the hypothesis of flavor oscillations @xcite in the @xmath13 channel ( @xmath11 being a linear combination of @xmath7 and @xmath14 ) driven by nonzero @xmath6 squared mass difference and mixing angle parameters ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 combination orthogonal to @xmath11 is probed by atmospheric @xmath6 oscillations @xcite , with different parameters @xmath17 @xcite . the third mixing angle @xmath18 , needed to complete the @xmath19 mixing matrix ,",
    "is constrained to be small by additional reactor results @xcite , and can be set to zero to a good approximation for our purposes .",
    "the recent results from the kamioka liquid scintillator antineutrino detector ( kamland ) @xcite have provided a beautiful and crucial confirmation of the solar @xmath10 oscillation picture through a search for long - baseline oscillations of reactor @xmath20 s .",
    "the observed of @xmath20 disappearance in kamland has confirmed the previously favored solution in the @xmath21 parameter space , often referred to as the large mixing angle ( lma ) region @xcite in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the kamland data have basically split this region into two allowed subregions , which we will refer to as lma - i and lma - ii , following ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sections",
    "3 we analyze the first kamland spectral data @xcite and combine them with current solar neutrino data @xcite , assuming two - flavor oscillations of active neutrinos @xcite , in order to determine the surviving sub - regions of the lma solution . in the analysis we include the chooz reactor data @xcite .    finally , in section 4",
    "we briefly illustrate how emerging indications of solar matter effects can be corroborated in the lma parameter region . in particular , we show that the amplitude of matter effects ( introduced as a free parameter @xmath22 ) can be significantly constrained by using prospective data from sno and kamland .",
    "a careful analysis of the sk and k2k data sets used in the following can be found in @xcite . concerning sk atmospheric neutrino data ( 92 kton - year @xcite )",
    ", we use the usual zenith angle @xmath23 distributions of leptons : sub - gev @xmath24-like and @xmath25-like events , divided in 10 + 10 bins ; multi - gev @xmath24-like and @xmath25-like events , divided in 10 + 10 bins ; upward stopping and through - going @xmath25 events , divided in 5 + 10 bins .",
    "the calculation of the theoretical events rates @xmath26 in each of the 55 bins is done as in @xcite .",
    "the sk statistical analysis is considerably improved with respect to @xcite .",
    "now the set of systematic errors has been enlarged to 11 entries , leading to a more complex structure of correlated errors affecting the @xmath26 s , as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "concerning the k2k data , we use the absolute spectrum of muon events in terms of the reconstructed neutrino energy @xmath27 @xcite , which provides a total of 29 events ( here divided in 6 bins ) . in this sample ,",
    "the parent neutrino interactions are dominantly quasi - elastic ( qe ) , and the reconstructed energy @xmath27 is thus closely correlated with the true neutrino energy @xmath28 .",
    "let us now discuss the updated bounds on the parameters @xmath29 , governing the scenario of standard oscillations ( here @xmath30 ) .",
    "channel : bounds on the parameters @xmath31 from sk atmospheric data ( left panel ) , k2k spectral data ( middle panel ) , and their combination ( right panel ) .",
    "_ ]    fig .",
    "1 shows the joint bounds on the @xmath29 parameters from our analysis of sk , k2k , and sk+k2k data .",
    "the bounds in the left panel are very close to the official sk ones , as presented in @xcite .",
    "the bounds in the middle panel are instead slightly weaker than the official k2k ones @xcite , especially in terms of @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , we do not find a lower bound on @xmath33 at 99% c.l .",
    "( for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the reason is that we can not use the additional ( dominantly ) non - qe event sample of k2k ( 27 events ) , which would help to constrain the overall rate normalization and thus @xmath35 .",
    "this fact might also explain why we find the k2k best fit at @xmath36 rather than at 1.00 as in @xcite . by comparing the left and right panels of fig .  1",
    ", the main effect of k2k appears to be the strengthening of the upper bound on @xmath37 , consistently with the trend of the first k2k data ( rate only @xcite , no spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that , for @xmath38@xmath39 ev@xmath4 , the first oscillation minimum would be located at  or just above  the k2k energy spectrum peak , implying a strong local and overall suppression of the expected events .",
    "2 shows on the left the sk and sk+k2k bounds on @xmath37 , when the @xmath35 parameter is projected ( minimized ) away .",
    "the linear scale in @xmath37 makes the k2k impact on the upper limit more evident .",
    "notice that , up to @xmath40 , the global ( sk+k2k ) @xmath41 function is approximately parabolic in the _ linear _ variable @xmath37 , so that one can define a one- standard - deviation error for this parameter .",
    "this feature was already argued on the basis of a graphical reduction of the official sk and k2k likelihood functions @xcite , and is here confirmed through a full analysis . by keeping only the first significant figure in the error estimate , a parabolic fit provides the @xmath42 range @xmath43 the bounds on @xmath35 are instead entirely dominated by sk .",
    "this is shown on the right of fig .  3 , where the @xmath44 function in terms of @xmath35 is reported , for @xmath37 projected ( minimized ) away in the sk fit . here",
    "the addition of k2k data would insignificantly change the bounds ( not shown ) , which thus hold for both the sk and the sk+k2k fit .",
    "also in this case , the nearly parabolic behavior of @xmath45 allows to properly define a @xmath46 range ,    @xmath47    with the lower @xmath48 error scaling linearly with @xmath49 ( up to @xmath50 ) .",
    "equations  ( [ dm2range ] ) and ( [ sinrange ] ) concisely review the current fit to the standard oscillation parameters , as anticipated in the introduction .    ) , compared with the corresponding theoretical ones at the global ( sk+k2k ) best - fit point . all distributions are normalized to the unoscillated predictions in each bin . for the theoretical event rates , we show both the central values @xmath26 ( dashed histograms ) and the `` shifted '' values @xmath51 ( solid histograms ) , which embed the effect of systematic pulls .",
    "the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath26 shows how much ( and in which direction ) the correlated systematic errors tend to stretch the predictions in order to match the data .",
    "_ ]    fig .",
    "3 shows the comparison between observations and best - fit predictions for the sk zenith distributions .",
    "in particular , the comparison between solid and dashed histograms shows that the systematic shifts are often comparable in size to the statistical errors , implying that just increasing the sk atmospheric @xmath6 statistics will hardly bring decisive new information on the standard oscillation scenario . in the sg and mg samples",
    ", the fit clearly exploits the systematic uncertainties to increase the @xmath24-like event normalization , especially in the upward direction , so as to reduce the `` electron excess '' possibly indicated by sk data .",
    "concerning @xmath25-like events in the sg and mg samples , the fit shows an opposite tendency to slightly decrease the normalization of ( especially down - going ) events .",
    "the tendency appears to be reversed in the high - energy ut sample . taken together , these opposite shifts of @xmath24-like and @xmath25-like expectations in the sg and mg samples seem to suggest some systematic deviation from the predicted @xmath52 flavor ratio which , although not statistically alarming , should be kept in mind : deviations of similar size might have their origin in neutrino physics beyond @xmath53 oscillations .",
    "unfortunately , since such effects are typically not larger than the systematic shifts in fig .",
    "3 , they are likely to remain hidden in higher - statistics sk data .",
    "parameter space , restricted to the lma region .",
    "the best fit is indicated by a black dot . _ ]    the kamland recent observation of @xmath20 disappearance @xcite confirms the current interpretation of solar neutrino data @xcite in terms of @xmath54 oscillations induced by neutrino mass and mixing @xcite , and restricts the corresponding parameter space @xmath21 within the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) region . in this region , globally favored by solar neutrino data , matter effects @xcite in adiabatic regime @xcite",
    "are expected to dominate the dynamics of flavor transitions in the sun ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the kamland spectral data appear to exclude some significant portions of the lma solution @xcite , where the predicted spectrum distortions @xcite would be in conflict with observations @xcite .    in the @xmath53 case , we find that the inclusion of the kamland spectrum basically splits the lma solution into two sub - regions at `` small '' and `` large '' @xmath55 , which we call lma - i and lma - ii , respectively ( the lma - i solution being preferred by the data ) @xcite .",
    "such regions are only slightly modified in the presence of @xmath56 mixing , namely , for nonzero values of the mixing angle @xmath18 .",
    "we also present updated bounds ( as of june 2003 ) in the @xmath56 parameter space @xmath57 .    in our kamland data analysis @xcite",
    ", we use the absolute spectrum of events reported in @xcite , taken above a background - safe analysis threshold of 2.6 mev in visible energy @xmath27 .",
    "the events below such threshold might contain a significant component of geological @xmath20 s @xcite , whose large normalization uncertainties are poorly constrained at present by the kamland data themselves @xcite . above 2.6 mev ,",
    "a total of 54 events is found , against 86.8 events expected from reactors @xcite .",
    "finally , the observed energy spectrum of events is analyzed as in @xcite , with the improvements reported in @xcite .",
    "an updated @xmath53 analysis of current solar+chooz neutrino data , @xcite , is presented here .",
    "the fit includes 81 solar neutrino observables @xcite and 14 chooz spectrum bins @xcite , for a total of 95 data points .",
    "the @xmath44 expansion around the minimum , relevant for the estimation of the oscillation parameters @xmath58 , is shown in fig .  4 , where we have restricted the @xmath55 range to the only three decades relevant for the lma solution and for the following kamland analysis .     parameter space .",
    "a `` tower '' of octant - symmetric regions is allowed at different values of @xmath59 .",
    "the symmetric best fits are indicated by black dots .",
    "the left dot is remarkably close to the solar best fit in fig .",
    "_ ]    in fig .",
    "5 we report the @xmath53 analysis of kamland @xcite : there appears to be a `` tower '' of solutions which tend to merge and become indistinguishable for increasing @xmath55 ; the lower three ones are , however , rather well separated at 90% c.l .",
    "notice that our allowed regions are slightly larger ( i.e. , less constraining ) than those in the rate+shape analysis of @xcite .",
    "one of the two octant - symmetric best fits points in fig .",
    "5 ( black dots ) is remarkably close to the best fit in fig .",
    "the difference in location with respect to the kamland official best - fit point at @xmath60 @xcite is not statistically significant , amounting to a variation @xmath61 .",
    "parameter space . with respect to fig .",
    "4 , the lma region is significantly restricted , and appears to be split into two sub - regions ( lma - i and lma - ii ) , well - separated at 99% c.l . _ ]    the combination of the solar+chooz results in fig .  4 with the kamland results in fig .",
    "5 gives the global @xmath53 results shown in fig .",
    "two rather distinct solutions , that we label lma - i and lma - ii , are seen to emerge . the lma - i solution is clearly preferred by the data , being close to the best fit points of both solar+chooz and kamland data .",
    "the lma - ii solution is located at a @xmath55 value about twice as large as for the lma - i , but is separated from the latter by a modest @xmath62 difference ( dominated by solar neutrino data ) . indeed , if we conservatively demand a 99.73% c.l .  for the allowed regions ,",
    "the lma - i and lma - ii solutions appear to merge ( and extend towards @xmath63 ev@xmath4 ) in a single broad solution . in any case , at any chosen c.l . , the allowed regions of fig .  6 are significantly smaller than those in fig .",
    "4 . therefore , with just 54 initial events , the kamland experiment is not only able to select the lma region as _",
    "the _ solution to the solar neutrino problem , but can also significantly restrict the corresponding oscillation parameter space . with several hundred events expected in the forthcoming years ,",
    "there are thus very good prospects to refine the parameter estimate @xcite .",
    "within the lma region , solar neutrino oscillations are governed not only by the kinematical mass - mixing parameters @xmath64 ) , but should also be significantly affected by the interaction energy difference ( @xmath65 ) between @xmath10 s and @xmath11 s propagating in the solar ( and possibly earth ) background matter @xcite , through the so - called mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite in adiabatic regime @xcite . although earth matter effects ( i.e. , day - night variations of solar event rates ) remain elusive , solar matter effects seem to emerge , at least indirectly , from the combination of the available data ( and especially from sno ) , through a preference for an average oscillation probability smaller than @xmath66 at energies of a few mev .",
    "a phenomenological approach to the problem has been recently presented in @xcite , where a free parameter @xmath22 is introduced , called to modulate the overall amplitude of the interaction energy difference @xmath67 in the dynamical term @xmath68 of the hamiltonian , @xmath69 by treating @xmath22 as a continuous parameter , one can try to constrain its allowed range through global data analyses : a preference for @xmath70 would then provide an indirect indication for the occurrence of matter effects with standard size , as opposed to the case of pure `` vacuum '' oscillations ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we have verified that the current solar neutrino data , by themselves , place only very loose and uninteresting limits on @xmath22 , as far as the mass - mixing oscillation parameters are left unconstrained . in fact , since the oscillation physics depends mostly on the ratio @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the neutrino oscillation wavenumber , a variation of the kind @xmath74 is largely absorbed by a similar rescaling of @xmath75 ( i.e. , of @xmath55 ) . in order to break this degeneracy , we need to include explicitly an experiment which is highly sensitive to @xmath55 and basically insensitive to matter effects , such as kamland .",
    "a ssm - independent preference for @xmath76 has been provided first by the combination of sno cc and sk data @xcite and then by sno data alone through the cc / nc double ratio @xcite , but not yet with a significance high enough to rule out @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "let us consider , in particular , the latest sno constraints in the plane @xmath78 charted by the solar @xmath10 and @xmath79 fluxes , as shown in fig .  3 of the original sno paper @xcite .",
    "in such a figure , although the sno best - fit point clearly prefers @xmath80 ( corresponding to @xmath81 ) , the 95% c.l.ellipse is still compatible with @xmath82 ( namely , @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , future sno nc and cc data can considerably improve the constraints on @xmath84 , by reducing both the statistical and the systematic error on the cc / nc ratio @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "although the combination of all current solar neutrino data suggests a pattern of @xmath84 compatible with the lma energy profile and indicates an overall preference for the first octant of @xmath85 @xcite , the emerging indications in favor of solar matter effects from this data set are not strongly compelling yet .    until now we have illustrated how a single datum ( the sno cc / nc double ratio ) can discriminate the case of standard matter effects @xmath86 from the case of zeroed matter effects @xmath87 in the lma parameter region . by using further experimental information from kamland",
    ", one could try to test @xcite whether the `` solar  +  kamland '' combination of data can constrain matter effects in the sun to have the right size [ @xmath70 ] . in this kind of analyses ,",
    "kamland basically fixes the oscillation parameters @xmath58 , and thus the kinetic part of the hamiltonian , @xmath89 .",
    "the role of solar neutrino data is then to check that the overall amplitude @xmath22 of the interaction energy difference @xmath67 in the dynamical term @xmath68 is consistent with the standard electroweak model ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we have thus performed global analyses including both current solar neutrino data and current ( or prospective ) kamland data , with @xmath91 unconstrained . in particular , the analysis of current kamland data is based on the binned energy spectrum of reactor neutrino events observed above 2.6 mev ( 54 events ) @xcite .",
    "prospective kamland spectral data have instead been generated , with the same energy threshold and binning , by assuming either the lma - i best - fit point ( @xmath92 ev@xmath4 and @xmath93 ) or the lma - ii best - fit point ( @xmath94 ev@xmath4 and @xmath95 ) @xcite , and increased statistics ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 events ) .",
    "the chooz reactor data @xcite are also included .     for unconstrained @xmath98 , including current solar and chooz neutrino data , as well as current or prospective kamland data .",
    "the solid curve refers to the fit including current kamland spectrum data above 2.6 mev threshold ( 54 events ) , and shows that the hypothetical case of zeroed matter effects is already disfavored .",
    "the other curves refer to simulated kamland data , generated by assuming the lma - i solution , and statistics increased by a factor of five ( dotted curve ) and of ten ( dashed curve ) . _ ]    figure  7 shows the results of such global fits , in terms of the function @xmath99 for variable @xmath22 and unconstrained ( i.e. , minimized away ) mass - mixing parameters .",
    "the @xmath100 bounds on @xmath22 are then given by @xmath101 .",
    "let us focus first on the solid curve , which refers to the fit with _",
    "current _ kamland data .",
    "it appears that such curve can already place @xmath102 upper and lower bounds on @xmath22 . in particular , the hypothetical case of zeroed matter effects is already disfavored at @xmath103 , thus providing an indirect indication in favor of matter effects in the sun .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath22 is close to the standard prediction ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "however , the overall @xmath104 range for @xmath22 , spanning about three orders of magnitude , is rather large .",
    "the width of this range can be understood by recalling the following facts : ( 1 ) the lma range of @xmath55 constrained by solar neutrino data , which covers about one decade @xcite , can be shifted up or down by shifting @xmath22 with respect to 1 , since the lma oscillation physics depends on @xmath105 ; ( 2 ) the range of @xmath55 constrained by current terrestrial data ( including kamland+chooz ) , which covers about two decades @xcite , is much less affected by @xmath22 variations . as a consequence , by appropriately shifting @xmath22 , it is possible to overlap the reconstructed ranges of @xmath55 from solar and from reactor data over about @xmath106 decades .",
    "when the overlap sweeps through the degenerate @xmath55 intervals allowed by kamland alone @xcite , the fit is locally improved , leading to a `` wavy '' structure in the @xmath44 . in conclusion , although current solar+reactor data strongly disfavor @xmath107 ( zeroed matter effects ) and provide a best fit close to @xmath90 ( standard matter effects ) , the presence of other local minima in the @xmath44 function , as well as the broad @xmath108 allowed range for @xmath22 , do not allow to claim a clear evidence of standard matter effects from current data .",
    "the broken curves in fig .",
    "7 refer to prospective kamland data , generated by assuming as true solution the lma - i best - fit point .",
    "the energy threshold , the binning , and the systematic uncertainties are assumed to be the same as for the current kamland data .",
    "the dotted ( dashed ) curve refers to a number of reactor neutrino events five ( ten ) times larger than the current statistics .",
    "it can be seen that the global fit will progressively constrain @xmath22 within one decade at @xmath109 and , most importantly , will lead to a marked preference for @xmath110 , which is not yet evident in the present data . in conclusion , if the lma - i solution is the true one , there are good prospect to test unambiguously the occurrence and size of standard matter effects in the sun .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the current sk atmospheric neutrino data and and the first k2k spectral data , in order to review the status of standard @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "we have then provided updated bounds for the standard oscillation parameters . in particular",
    ", the statistical analysis of the uncertainties reveals that k2k will lead further progress in this field , especially through higher - statistics tests of the low - energy spectrum bins .",
    "going to solar neutrinos , the kamland experiment has clearly selected the lma region as the solution to the solar neutrino problem , and has further reduced the @xmath111 parameter space for active neutrino oscillations . in the @xmath53 case ,",
    "we find that the post - kamland lma solution appears to be basically split into two sub - regions , lma - i and lma - ii .",
    "the lma - i solution , characterized by @xmath112 ev@xmath4 and @xmath113 , is preferred by the global fit .",
    "the lma - ii solution represents the second best fit , at about twice the value of @xmath55 .    in the simplest picture ,",
    "solar neutrino oscillations depend on the kinematical parameters @xmath111 and on standard dynamical msw effects in matter .",
    "these effects in current solar neutrino data are starting to emerge through an increasingly marked preference for @xmath76 , but still remain not clearly identified . in order to quantify statistically the occurrence of msw effects ,",
    "we have introduced a free parameter @xmath22 modulating the amplitude of the @xmath6 interaction energy difference in the neutrino evolution equation . by treating @xmath22 as a continuous parameter ,",
    "we have then performed a global analysis including current solar , chooz , and kamland data .",
    "the results are encouraging , since upper and lower bounds on @xmath22 appear to emerge at the @xmath102 level .",
    "in particular , the case of `` zeroed '' matter effects is significantly disfavored . moreover , the best - fit is tantalizingly close to the standard expectations for matter effects ( @xmath90 )",
    ".    the situation will improve through higher kamland statistics . in both the lma - i and lma - ii cases",
    ", it appears possible to reduce the current uncertainty on @xmath22 by about two orders of magnitude . in conclusion , the selection of a single solution in the lma oscillation parameter space appears to be crucial , before any definite conclusion can be made on the emerging indications of standard matter effects in the sun .",
