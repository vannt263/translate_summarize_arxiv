    "solar cell structures of n - sns : ag / pedot : pss were fabricated on etched indium tin oxide ( ito ) substrates of low resistivity ( @xmath5/sq ) . a 200  nm layer of aqueous solar grade pedot : pss ( 1.3  % ) was spin coated on the substrates . followed by this ,",
    "composite thin films of tin sulfide ( sns ) and silver ( ag ) were grown on the pedot : pss layer .",
    "the films were grown at room temperature by thermal evaporation technique using hind hi - vac ( 12a4d ) coating unit at vacuum better than @xmath6  torr . before evaporation , pellets were made by mixing sns powder and ag nano - powder .",
    "the sns powder ( 99.99  % pure ) was provided by himedia ( mumbai ) and the ag nano - powder was provided by nanoshel ( usa ) . for mixing , the ( mass ) ratio of sns :",
    "ag taken was in a proportion of 2:1 .",
    "the thickness of the composite films were measured using veeco s dektak surface profiler ( 150 ) on films grown simultaneously on glass substrates .",
    "finally , aluminum electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation using standard masks .",
    "the thicknesses of the sns : ag composite films were varied while that of the spin coated pedot : pss was maintained fixed .",
    "the structural characterizations of the sns films were done using a bruker d8 diffractometer at an operating voltage of 40  kv in the @xmath7 mode with cu target giving x - ray of @xmath8 .",
    "the current - voltage ( j - v ) measurements were done with a computer monitored keithley 2400 source meter unit . a solar simulator of @xmath9 , air mass ( am ) 1.5 spectrum was used as illumination source .",
    "the measurements were made with light incident from the ito side .",
    "in our previous study @xcite we showed that ag nano - clusters embedded in sns acts as center for light scattering thus increasing the optical path length of light within the active layer .",
    "as stated , this is expected to increase the efficiency of the solar - cell . in the following passages we investigate this and compare the photo - voltaic parameters of our plasmonic - device with pristine sns solar cells .",
    "0.3 cm    0.3 cm [ jvnew2 ]    fig  2 compares the j - v characteristics of sns solar cell with that of a plasmonic sns : ag solar cell .",
    "the curves selected are of cells with 800  nm thick photo - active layer and are representative of all measurements made . an increase in the efficiency of the plasmonic sns : ag cell can be judged by the increase in area enclosed by the j - v curve in the forth quadrant . in our study on pristine cells ,  @xcite we had discussed the properties as a function of sns grain size .",
    "however , the analysis of our previous work  @xcite suggests that ag nanoparticle s efficiency to scatter light into the dielectric sns background depends on the ag nanoparticles s grain size , it would be necessary to compare conversion efficiencies as a function of a parameter on which both ag and sns grain size would depend on .",
    "fortunately , both sns grain size  @xcite and ag nanoparticle s grain size  ( fig  3 ) show a linear trend with the active layer s thickness ( within region of experimental interest ) .    0.3 cm    0.3 cm [ grainrel ]    hence , in fig  4 , we plot the efficiency of sns thin film solar cells and sns : ag plasmonic solar cells as a function of the active layer s thickness .",
    "the conversion efficiency increases with increasing film thickness .",
    "in fact , for an active layer of thickness  800 nm , the conversion efficiency of the device is enhanced by 42@xmath10 when the ag nanoparticles were introduced in sns films . the increase ( rate ) in efficiency with film thickness",
    "can not be explained merely by the insignificant variation in absorbance with film thickness reported .",
    "@xcite    0.3 cm    0.3 cm    the increase in efficiency is hence related to the scattering from ag nanoparticles .",
    "larger metal nanoparticles results in more scattering .",
    "this increases the optical path of incident light within the cell leading to more charge carriers being released .",
    "a relook at fig  2 shows that the increase in efficiency of ag : sns solar cell is due to the increasing short - circuit current density , @xmath11 ( point at which j - v curve cuts the ` y'-axis ) with marginal or no increase in open circuit voltage , @xmath3 ( point at which j - v curve cuts the ` x'-axis ) .",
    "fig  5 shows a plot between ag nanoparticle s grain size and @xmath11 .",
    "the trend confirms that more charge carriers are generated with increasing ag nanoparticle s size .",
    "a maximum enhancement of 27@xmath10 in the photo - current was measured in sns : ag solar cells as compared to the pristine cells .",
    "plasmonic solar cells of sns were fabricated by co - evaporation of silver metal during the fabrication of ito - pedot : pss - ag : sns - al structures . a substantial increase in the conversion efficiency of the device",
    "was observed as compared to the pristine ( non - plasmonic ) ito - pedot : pss - sns - al structures .",
    "the increase in efficiency is shown to be due to increasing photo - current generated due to increase in light scattering within the cell due to the ag nanoparticles .",
    "the results are promising considering that we now can manipulate the inorganic , non - toxic sns solar devices for higher efficiency .",

    "<S> solar cells with the structure ito - pedot : pss - ag : sns - al were fabricated with the active layer of tin sulphide with silver nano - particles ( ag : sns ) grown by thermal co - evaporation . to understand the influence of the silver nanoparticles on the energy conversion process , </S>",
    "<S> various cells with varying active layer thicknesses were compared . </S>",
    "<S> results showed that the ag nanoparticles act as scattering centers , resulting in longer optical path lengths for incident light . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn results in more charge carriers being generated and thus enhances the efficiency of the structure as compared to the pristine ito - pedot : pss - sns - al structure . </S>",
    "<S> the plasmonic solar cells of sns showed an improvement of more than 40% . </S>",
    "<S> the results are encouraging and suggests more concerted effort needs to be made on sns .    </S>",
    "<S> present commercial solar cells are silicon wafer based with standard efficiency around 24.7% .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , using the single crystal wafers cut to micro - meter thicknesses , increases the cost and makes utilization of solar energy economically unattractive . </S>",
    "<S> researchers hence have started looking into organic  @xcite and inorganic  @xcite materials in thin film state either in amorphous or polycrystalline state .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the hope is to increase efficiency at a lower cost , effectively decreasing the energy conversion cost . </S>",
    "<S> the inorganic solar cells have not matched the efficiency of silicon wafer solar cells as yet , with the best efficiency reported at 16.5% for cadmium telluride ( cdte )  @xcite film solar cells . </S>",
    "<S> however , with concerns on the toxicity of tellurium used , search has moved to other inorganic materials such as tin sulphide ( sns )  @xcite and lead sulphide ( pbs ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the basic idea of solar cells are to absorb photons and generate charge carriers within the junction which should readily separate and reach their respective electrodes without recombination . to improve efficiency </S>",
    "<S> one requires a good absorbing material for the photo - active layer . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved either by using an active layer of good absorbance or increase its thickness .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the thickness of the layer is limited by the carrier diffusion length , i.e. the thickness of the active layer should always be less than the carrier diffusion length .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite if the thickness of the active layer is larger than the carrier diffusion length , the carriers would recombine before being collected at the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> this would reduce the current in the external circuitry and hence diminish the performance of the cell . </S>",
    "<S> also , increasing the dimension of the absorber layer would raise the cost of the device . </S>",
    "<S> selection of the second layer with opposite charge carriers ( n or p type ) to that of the semiconducting nature of the photo - active layer ( p or n type ) also plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> the selection is made in view of matching the conduction and valence energy levels of the two layers such that the separation of the generated charge carriers is encouraged .    </S>",
    "<S> to increase the absorbance of the active layer without increasing the thickness , researchers are now investigating effects of embedding metal nanoparticles within the active layer . when light is incident on the metal / dielectric or a metal / semiconductor interface , it gives rise to collective oscillation of electrons known as  surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) \" .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at this particular resonance frequency , the nanoparticles either effectively absorbs light or scatters it .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the amount of light scattered or absorbed depends on the size of the metal nanoparticles .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite reported a significant enhancement in the photo - current for n - cdse heterojunction solar cells containing au nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> stenzel et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reported an improvement in photo - current by a factor of 2.7 when au or cu nanoparticles were embedded into ito - copper phthalocyanine - in structures . </S>",
    "<S> similar studies have been made in organic solar cells too ,  @xcite however till date , this plasmonic enhancement approach has not seen in sns thin films . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it would be interesting to see if the formation of lspr improves the efficiencies of sns solar cells .    </S>",
    "<S> sns based solar cells today have very low conversion efficiency ( at best 2%  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> various research groups hence have focused on the factors that can improve the efficiency of sns solar cells  @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while majority of research try to address issue of selecting an appropriate companion ` p ' or ` n'-layer ,  @xcite few groups have focused on improving the absorption of the photo - active sns layer ,  @xcite by varying the thickness ,  @xcite or as in the stray example by embedding metal clusters within the film thickness  @xcite ( however , it must be noted that ristov et al did not talk of spr in their work ) .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    0.3 cm [ experiment1 ]    tan et al  @xcite in 2010 reported a solar cell structure based on @xmath0 quantum dots with pedot : pss on ito substrate . </S>",
    "<S> both the pedot : pss and @xmath0 layers were fabricated by spin - coat technique . </S>",
