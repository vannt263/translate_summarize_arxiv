    "<S> topological defects in ordered states with spontaneously broken symmetry often have unusual physical properties , such as fractional electric charge or a quantised magnetic field - flux , originating from their non - trivial topology . </S>",

    "<S> hexagonal manganites provide an extra degree of freedom : in these materials , both ferroelectricity and magnetism are coupled to an additional , non - ferroelectric structural order parameter . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a theoretical study of topological defects in hexagonal manganites based on landau theory with parameters determined from first - principles calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the observed flip of electric polarisation at the boundaries of structural domains , the origin of the observed discrete vortices , and the clamping between ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> we show that structural vortices induce magnetic ones and that , consistent with a recent experimental report , ferroelectric domain walls can carry a magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental and theoretical advances in the field of multiferroics have clarified the microscopic mechanisms of coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism in _ </S>",
    "<S> bulk _ materials and led to the discovery of many families of materials in which ferroelectricity is induced by a spin ordering . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting electric polarisation is highly susceptible to an applied magnetic field and can be easily rotated or reversed@xcite . however , this magnetically - induced polarisation is usually too small to allow manipulation of spin states by an applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> much larger electric polarisations are found in multiferroics such as bifeo@xmath0 and the hexagonal rare - earth manganites , in which ferroelectricity results not from spin ordering but from electronic and lattice instabilities@xcite . yet in these materials , the electric control of magnetism is not straightforward@xcite , since the direction of spins in the magnetically ordered state is not correlated with the sign of the macroscopic electric polarisation@xcite .    while enhancing _ </S>",
    "<S> bulk _ </S>",
    "<S> couplings between polarisation and magnetism is difficult , practical switching of a ferroic order parameter with an applied field invariably involves motion of the domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> magnetoelectric _ switching _ therefore depends crucially on interactions between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domain walls , which are not as well understood . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the observed clamping between ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain walls in multiferroic hexagonal manganites@xcite provides a unique prototype for investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal manganites , @xmath1mno@xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a small - radius rare earth ion ( dy , ho , er , tm , yb , lu ) , y or sc , are improper ferroelectrics ; electric polarisation appears as a by - product of a primary structural transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure consists of corner - sharing mno@xmath2 trigonal bipyramids , which form triangular layers , separated by layers of @xmath1 ions . </S>",
    "<S> the structural transition above @xmath3k results in periodic tilts of the mno@xmath2 bipyramids and displacements of the @xmath1 ions along the @xmath4 axis normal to the layers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this periodic @xmath5 lattice distortion makes the size of the unit cell three times larger and is often referred to as the trimerisation transition ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trim](a - c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anharmonic coupling between the trimerisation mode and a polar optical phonon mode induces the observed electric polarisation along the @xmath4 axis , @xmath6@xmath7@xcite .    at much lower temperatures , @xmath8k , an antiferromagnetic ordering of mn spins </S>",
    "<S> emerges . while there is a large body of evidence for the strong interplay between the microscopic spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom in hexagonal manganites@xcite , the sign of the overall antiferromagnetic order parameter is decoupled from the direction of the macroscopic electric polarisation , as such correlation is forbidden by symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore came as a surprise when non - linear optical measurements of ymno@xmath0  demonstrated that ferroelectric domain walls are locked to magnetic ones@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this clamping was found to be non - reciprocal , as `` free '' magnetic domain walls , not associated with the electric polarisation reversals , were also observed . </S>",
    "<S> proposals for the clamping mechanism have included strain mediation@xcite and renormalisation of spin interactions at ferroelectric walls@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , new observational evidence has shed light on the mechanism for clamping . a combination of conducting atomic - force microscopy and transmission - electron microscopy demonstrated that the ferroelectric domain walls are pinned to the boundaries of the structural domains that appear upon transition to the trimerised state.@xcite these measurements also revealed intricate patterns of unusual line defects . </S>",
    "<S> these so - called ` cloverleaf ' defects,@xcite at which six different structural and ferroelectric domains merge , have also been seen in piezoresponse force microscopy.@xcite in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested that the line defects are discrete analogues of vortices , and that the change of polarisation sign at structural domain boundaries is a consequence of the special form of the coupling between the lattice distortion and electric polarisation originating from the `` geometric '' nature of ferroelectricity in hexagonal manganites@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results put the clamping between the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain walls into an entirely new perspective .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the interplay between structural , ferroelectric and magnetic defects in hexagonal manganites using an expansion of the free energy in powers of the corresponding order parameters and their gradients . based on symmetries of ordered states of these materials , </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to identify stable topological defects and describe their mutual interactions in the most economical way . in ref .   </S>",

    "<S> the free energies per unit area of the two walls are @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> this is because the tilts of the oxygen bipyramids , described by the angle @xmath9 , determine the in - plane magnetic anisotropy axes . a shift by one lattice constant ( of the non - trimerised lattice ) within the uniform domain results in a @xmath101 rotation of the anisotropy axes , since @xmath127 . </S>",
