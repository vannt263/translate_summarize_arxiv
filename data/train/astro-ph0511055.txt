    "discovered by the _ voyager",
    "_ spacecraft in 1980 and 1981 , prometheus and pandora are two small moons of saturn .",
    "properties of their orbits are summarized in table [ tab : eqterms ] .",
    "a series of observations starting in 1995 found that the orbital longitude of each satellite deviated by about 20 degrees from its value as predicted by the _",
    "voyager _ ephemeris ( bosh & rivkin , 1996 ; nicholson et al . , 1996 ; mcghee et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "further , each satellite s mean motion underwent an abrupt change in 2000 ( french et al . , 2002 ) ,",
    "seen as `` kinks '' in their mean longitudes .",
    "goldreich & rappaport ( 2003a ; gr03a ) pinpointed chaos due to the satellites mutual gravitational interactions as the cause of these discrepancies .",
    "the system was found to have a lyapunov exponent @xmath00.3 yr@xmath1 .",
    "jumps in the mean motion were attributed to the stronger interactions that occur when the orbits apses are antialigned .",
    "orbital integrations in gr03a reproduce the observed gradual drifts away from the _ voyager_-based predictions .",
    "kinks in the mean longitudes are apparent every 6.2 years , at times of apse antialignment .",
    "goldreich & rappaport ( 2003b ; gr03b ) captures the essential dynamics of the system by including only interactions due to the 121:118 mean motion resonance .",
    "more complete numerical simulations of the system , which include the influences of other saturnian satellites , have been performed by cooper & murray ( 2004 ) ; jacobson & french ( 2004 ) ; and renner , sicardy & french ( 2005 ) .",
    "these confirm that the simplified dynamics in gr03b is sufficient to describe the chaotic motions of prometheus and pandora .",
    "physical explanations for the mean motion jumps have not advanced beyond those proposed by goldreich & rappaport : all of the above papers cite enhanced interactions at apse antialignment as the reason for the kinks in the mean longitudes observed in 2000 .",
    "they do nothing to dispel the expectation that the mean longitudes will continue to display the same drift - kink behavior indefinitely into the future .",
    "a practical consequence of this belief is that orbits fitted to cassini data avoid times around apse antialignment and assume freely precessing ellipses between these times ( porco et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we show that a proper understanding of the dynamics of the prometheus - pandora system is more subtle than previously recognized . in doing",
    "so we exploit an analogy with the dynamics of a parametric pendulum to reinterpret numerical integrations presented in gr03b .",
    "we confirm that separatrix crossings are the cause of chaos and that their rate determines the magnitude of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "our focus is on the precessional phase at which separatrix crossings occur .",
    "currently the two that take place during each 6.2 yr precessional cycle occur near apse antialignment and the kinks arise during intervals of libration separated by long stretches of circulation .",
    "more generally , separatrix crossings can occur at any precessional phase , with large changes in these phases predicted on timescales of one to two decades .",
    "when crossings take place near apse alignment , the system remains chaotic but displays qualitatively different features than at present .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : eq ] we demonstrate the similarity between the dynamics of the prometheus - pandora interaction and that of a parametric pendulum .",
    "we study the behavior of an adiabatic parametric pendulum in  [ sec : behave ] . in ",
    "[ sec : panprom ] we apply these findings to the prometheus - pandora system , and discuss both the implications and the limitations of our analogy .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "gr03b showed that the chaotic motions of prometheus and pandora arise from their 121:118 mean motion resonance .",
    "differential precession of the two eccentric orbits splits the resonance into four discrete components whose arguments are @xmath2 , with @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the mean longitudes of prometheus and pandora , and @xmath6 gr03b note that because of the rapid precession caused by saturn s oblateness , interactions between the satellites produce negligible effects on their apsidal angles and orbital eccentricities .",
    "therefore it is adequate to only treat changes in mean motions , or equivalently in the angle @xmath7 .",

    "the potential in which @xmath19 moves is given by @xmath20 plots of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are displayed in figure [ fig : pot ] . , we approximate @xmath15 to be constant at @xmath25 when we calculate the action for the prometheus - pandora system .",

    "the term @xmath69 is proportional to the difference between the system s energy and the separatrix energy when the system makes its last passage through a potential trough prior to crossing a separatrix .",
    "we construct the probability distribution @xmath70 of jump sizes under the assumption that @xmath69 is uniformly distributed between @xmath71 . over many separatrix crossings the action performs a quasi - random walk in which the diffusion constant is proportional to @xmath72 . from the plot of the integrand in figure [ fig : djdist ]",

    "the pendulum mostly librates or mostly circulates , according to whether its action is close to the minimum or maximum value in the chaotic zone .",

    "as expected , the system samples each type of behavior .",
    "now we return to the prometheus - pandora system and detail similarities between its behavior and that of a parametric pendulum .",
    "although our interpretation of the satellites motions rests on the pendulum analogy , we integrate the full equation of motion ( eq . [ eq : full ] ) for @xmath46 and the linear equation for the tangent vector @xmath77 derived from it . because the system is chaotic , it explores the entire accessible region of phase space for arbitrary initial data .",
    "we find it most convenient to adopt the initial data used by gr03b for easier comparison between their results and ours . a long integration yields a lyapunov exponent @xmath78 yr@xmath1 , in agreement with that found by gr and other authors ( see figure [ fig : pp_lyap ] ) .    the variations of @xmath79 and @xmath7 for the satellite system ( plotted in figure [ fig : libcirc ] ) are reminiscent of those of the analogous variables pertaining to the parametric pendulum as illustrated in figure [ fig : model_plc ] .",
    "similar patterns of switching between libration and circulation are exhibited by each system .",
    "fractional variations of the action are larger in the satellite system because of its lower adiabaticity .",
    "gr03ab and subsequent authors state that jumps in the mean motions occur near apse antialignment .",
    "apse antialignment corresponds to the time of maximum amplitude of the potential .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : libcirc ] that separatrix crossings currently occur in that region .",
    "a similar behavior is seen in figure [ fig : hilo]a , in which the action is close to its maximum value in the chaotic zone .",
    "jumps in mean motion correspond to intervals spent in libration amidst stretches of circulation during which @xmath7 increases monotonically .",
    "changes in the slope , @xmath80 , from one episode of circulation to the next reflect changes in the action at the intervening separatrix crossings .",
    "the jumps are not _ due _ to chaos ; rather they are due to the separatrix crossings , which _ also _ give rise to chaos .",
    "changes in the circulation rate can be predicted , but only with an error that increases at every separatrix crossing .",
    "a chaotic system explores the entire chaotic zone in phase space .",
    "we expect the prometheus - pandora system to sample states that are unlike its current state in which the separatrix crossings occur near apse antialignment as seen in figure [ fig : hilo]a . averaged over time",
    ", separatrix crossings should not be restricted to a narrow range of precessional phase .",
    "in particular , states in which the separatrix crossings take place near apse alignment , such as shown in figure [ fig : hilo]b , must also be sampled .",
    "results from our integrations displayed in figure [ fig : range ] confirm this expectation ; the system experiences both states in which it is mostly in circulation and those in which it is mostly in libration .",
    "separatrix crossings , accompanied by sudden changes in the behavior of @xmath46 , happen at all precessional cycles .",
    "switching between regimes of behavior does not require a `` kick '' as such ; the requirement is that the potential change so that the system action moves to the other side of the separatrix action .",
    "this can happen as easily near apse alignment as near apse antialignment .",
    "a long integration confirms that the action wanders throughout the chaotic zone ( figure [ fig : pp_jwander ] , cf .",
    "also figure [ fig : jwander ] ) . eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : tc ] ) predict that it takes @xmath0 170 years for the action to diffuse all the way across the zone . due to the weak adiabaticity in this case ,",
    "a single large jump can span a large fraction of the total range of action . flipping between moderately high and moderately low action states",
    "can therefore occur in a much shorter time , as seen in figure [ fig : pp_jwander ] .    within measurement errors ,",
    "a variety of orbits fit the best orbital data for prometheus and pandora .",
    "renner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that after two separatrix crossings ( their 2004 point ) , there is an uncertainty of 0.2@xmath81 in the longitude of each satellite .",
    "starting from this level of positional uncertainty and holding all other orbital elements fixed , we integrate forward in time a set of 3 trajectories spanning the error range .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : whenchange ] , in which the action for each trajectory is plotted against the separatrix action . in only 15 years from the start of our integration , one of the trajectories has already transitioned from a state of high to low action ( due to experiencing a large jump ) .",
    "this illustrates that only a small uncertainty in positions can rapidly amplify to give a qualitative change in system behavior .",
    "the prometheus - pandora system is not strongly adiabatic , since only about 3 periods of oscillation take place during the modulation of the potential .",
    "because the amplitude of the potential varies substantially over the period of motion , we expect our frozen potential assumption to lead to uncertainties of order half a period of the motion in the positioning of the separatrix crossings .",
    "however , we have seen that the crossing positions are adequately located by this method .",
    "a more serious problem is the fact that we do not fulfill the condition @xmath82 throughout all of the precessional cycle .",
    "the dashed line plotted in figure [ fig : pot ] shows the magnitude of the @xmath83 term in comparison with @xmath84 . for about one third of the time ( around apse alignment )",
    ", we do not fulfill this condition , and the pendulum equation does not describe the system well at all . during these times , the system is essentially governed by @xmath85 , so @xmath19 appears to circulate .",
    "perhaps then we can not define a separatrix crossing near apse alignment .",
    "we do find some evidence ( not detailed in this paper ) that greater jumps in the separation of trajectories occur near apse antialignment than near apse alignment .",
    "undeniably however , changes in the evolution of @xmath46 occur throughout the precessional cycle ( figure [ fig : range ] ) , and this statement is independent of the pendulum analogy , since it is based on integrations of the full equation of motion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : full ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the orbits between apse antialignments certainly can not always be fitted using freely precessing ellipses .",
    "the equations of motion of the prometheus - pandora resonant system are well represented by those of a parametric pendulum . despite the low degree of adiabaticity of the system ,",
    "the same regimes of behavior exist as found in a more adiabatic model system . using this analogy ,",
    "we have explained the nature of the `` kinks '' in mean longitude seen in both observations and simulations as short episodes of libration between long stretches of circulation .",
    "we caution that the system will not continue indefinitely to display periods of drift with intervening kinks : in as little as 15 years , the evolution of the mean motions could be drastically different .",
    "sudden changes in behavior ( and increased uncertainties in predictions ) can happen far from times of apse antialignment .",
