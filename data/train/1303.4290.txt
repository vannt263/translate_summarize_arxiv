    "ever since the early days of condensed matter physics , quantum magnets have played an integral role in shaping our understanding of interacting quantum many - body systems . following the experimental discovery of the high - temperature superconductors whose undoped parent compounds typically are antiferromagnets ,",
    "the study of quantum magnets has further intensified yielding a plethora of deeper insights .",
    "early on , quantum spin chains  typically one - dimensional arrangements of su(2 ) spins  have become prototypical systems that proved to be fruitful ground for analytical descriptions and quasi - exact numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "one seminal result was the exact solution of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg chain via the bethe ansatz and its description in terms of conformal field theory .",
    "another crucial contribution was haldane s realization @xcite that the antiferromagnetic spin-1 heisenberg chain forms a gapped state with characteristic zero - energy edge states for open boundary conditions  a principle observation that holds true for all half - integer and integer spin chains .",
    "more recently , it has been found that the gapped haldane phase of the spin-1 chain is an example of a symmetry protected topological phase @xcite making it a one - dimensional cousin of topological insulator states in two and three dimensions @xcite , which have attracted much recent interest .    over the years",
    ", a plethora of physical systems that connect to the elementary physics of quantum spin chains have been identified , including transition metal oxides @xcite , au quantum wires on semiconducting surfaces @xcite , or ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been realized that certain ` deformations ' of quantum spins can be used to describe some of the more peculiar topological properties of exotic quasiparticles , so - called non - abelian anyons , that arise in certain topologically ordered systems , including certain fractional quantum hall states@xcite , @xmath6 superconductors @xcite , heterostructures of topological insulators and superconductors @xcite , heterostructures of spin - orbit coupled semiconductors and superconductors @xcite and possibly certain iridates @xcite which may effectively realize the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite . to be more specific , the deformations of quantum spins are representations of the anyon theories called su(2)@xmath0 , which can be described as theory of ordinary su(2 ) quantum spins that is deformed in such a way that only the first @xmath1 ( generalized ) angular momenta @xmath7 can occur .",
    "these generalized angular momenta capture the non - abelian properties of the anyonic quasiparticles present in the su(2)@xmath0 theory .",
    "for instance , the non - abelian nature of the so - called majorana fermion is captured by the generalized angular momentum 1/2 of the su(2)@xmath8 theory .",
    "the same holds for so - called ising anyons , while fibonacci anyons can be represented by the generalized angular momentum 1 of the su(2)@xmath9 theory .",
    "similar to the coupling of two ordinary spins , a pair of generalized angular momenta can be combined ( or ` fused ' ) into a new set of joint quantum numbers .",
    "for instance , for @xmath10 , two generalized angular momenta @xmath11 can be combined to form either a state with generalized angular momentum @xmath12 or a state with generalized angular momentum @xmath13 , which is written as @xmath14 reminiscent of two ordinary spin 1/2 s forming either a singlet or triplet state .",
    "similarly , two generalized angular momenta @xmath13 can be combined into @xmath15 for deformation parameters @xmath16 . for lower values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the rules differ because the number of representations is limited by @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath17 , one finds @xmath18 , while for @xmath19 , one has @xmath20 . finally , for @xmath21 , the general momentum @xmath13 is not allowed . for the anyonic theories , the above equations are often referred to as fusion rules .",
    "the many - body physics of a set of interacting non - abelian anyons can be captured by a hamiltonian that is formed by pairwise interactions which assign energies to the different outcomes in the above fusion rules .",
    "such an approach is a straightforward generalization of the conventional heisenberg model , whose pairwise interaction term @xmath22 is simply a projector onto the singlet state , which is energetically favored for antiferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath23 ) or penalized for ferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the first step in this direction was taken by some of us for anyonic spin-1/2 chains in ref .",
    "( ) and later generalized to spin-1 chains in ref .",
    "( ) by the current group of authors . the careful analysis of the ground states of these one - dimensional systems has resulted in a number of insights .",
    "first , anyonic spin-1/2 chains typically form gapless ground states which can be described in terms of conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "these gapless states turn out to be protected by a topological symmetry inherent to the anyon chains that renders them stable against local perturbations@xcite .",
    "moreover , these gapless states can in fact be interpreted as edge states that reveal the true ground state of a two - dimensional set of anyons  a novel topological liquid that is separated by the original topological liquids ( of which the anyons are excitations ) by an edge @xcite .",
    "this picture has been verified by a careful analysis of ladder systems , in which multiple chains are coupled@xcite .",
    "going beyond spin-1/2 chains , we began to study the physics of anyonic spin-1 chains with first results being reported in a preceding ( much more condensed ) paper @xcite . in the manuscript at hand",
    ", we provide an in - depth discussion of these anyonic spin-1 chains .",
    "we find that many of the distinctive features of ordinary su(2 ) spin-1/2 and spin-1 chains also hold for their anyonic cousins .",
    "for instance , anyonic spin-1 chains exhibit a gapped topological phase for antiferromagnetic couplings  the anyonic generalization of the haldane phase . exploring the phase diagram of chains of pairwise interacting spin-1 anyons",
    ", we find a striking resemblance of the anyonic phase diagram to the one of the ordinary bilinear - biquadratic spin-1 chain .",
    "in particular , we find multiple gapless phases ( and phase transitions ) in addition to the gapped haldane phase .",
    "for the former , a similar topological protection mechanism and edge state interpretation holds as for the gapless phases of the anyonic spin-1/2 chains @xcite .",
    "the focus of this manuscript is to provide an exhaustive description of the phase diagram(s ) of the anyonic spin-1 chains .",
    "our exploration of these systems has led to a large amount of results as the phase diagrams turned out to be much richer than initially anticipated .",
    "in particular , we find two families of phase diagrams depending on whether the deformation parameter @xmath3 of the su(2)@xmath0 anyonic theories is odd or even .",
    "moreover , we obtain a distinct phase diagram for @xmath25 , a result that can be explained by the special role played by the generalized angular momentum @xmath13 in the su(2)@xmath5 theory .    in order to guide the reader through these various results",
    "we have taken some care to structure the manuscript as follows : we will start with an introduction to the anyonic su(2)@xmath0 theories and a description of the anyonic generalization of the heisenberg model in section ii .",
    "the following sections will then give a detailed expos of our results , devoting sec .",
    "iii to the discussion of anyonic spin-1 chains with odd deformation parameters @xmath4 , followed by a discussion of the case of even deformation parameters @xmath26 in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v we will turn to the case of @xmath25 for which the spin-1 representation plays a special role and a rich phase diagram is obtained .",
    "we will then turn to anyonic spin-1/2 chains and discuss their physics , in particular their topological stability in sec .",
    "we will end with a broader discussion of our results , in particular in light of other deformations of conventional spin chains such as continuous su(2)@xmath27 deformations or so - called ( fused ) temperley - lieb spin chains .",
    "the main part of the manuscript is followed by an appendix that provides the technical details of our calculations .",
    "in light of the recent interest in topological phases of matter , it is of great importance to gain an understanding topological models in their simplest incarnation , and we will thus study one - dimensional chains of interacting non - abelian anyons . in this section , we will briefly explain the models by drawing parallels with ordinary one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "moreover , we will explain why the ` topological ' nature of these models goes beyond the fact that they are constructed from ` topological ' particles , namely non - abelian anyons .",
    "one of the prototypical one - dimensional spin chain models is the heisenberg model , in which su(2 ) spins interact via a ` spin - spin ' interaction of the type @xmath28 , where the labels @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the locations of the interacting spins .",
    "often , one restricts the interaction to nearest - neighbor , or next - nearest - neighbor pairs of spins . for the description of the anyonic quantum spin chains",
    ", it will be beneficial to think of this interaction in terms of the total spin of the two interacting spins . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "as a first example , we look at conventional su(2 ) spin-@xmath11 , and consider the total spin @xmath31 @xmath32 of two interacting spins @xmath33 and @xmath34 , whose magnitude is characterized by the eigenvalue of @xmath35 @xmath36 . because the total spin @xmath37 can be either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , with @xmath38 eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath39 , we can write @xmath40 where the projection operator @xmath41 projects onto the total spin @xmath42 channel of the two spins @xmath43 and @xmath34 . evaluating the left hand side , one obtains @xmath44 where in the last step we used that we can rewrite the identity operator as @xmath45 , which holds in the case of spin-@xmath11 .",
    "we conclude that the heisenberg interaction assigns energy to two interacting spins , depending on their combined spin , and the heisenberg hamiltonian can be written in terms of projectors as @xmath46 where @xmath47 corresponds to an antiferromagnetic coupling , and @xmath48 to the ferromagnetic version .",
    "for spin-@xmath13 , one can similarly write the bilinear and bi - quadratic terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , in terms of the projection operators @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". in particular , the relations @xmath53 can be rewritten as @xmath54 consequently , the bilinear - biquadratic spin-@xmath13 hamiltonian @xmath55 can be expressed in terms of the projectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 as follows , @xmath56 here , the relation between the two angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 is given by @xmath59    we will now shift our attention to anyonic degrees of freedom .",
    "details about anyon models , in particular those of type su(2)@xmath0 , can be found in appendix  [ app : su2k - anyons ] .",
    "a general introduction can be found , e.g. , in references ref .",
    "( ) . here , we will only introduce those concepts that are necessary for defining the chain hamiltonians .",
    "the hamiltonians for the anyon chains that we will consider in this paper are of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin1-hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the projectors @xmath60 in that equation have however a different meaning for anyons ( as compared to ordinary spins ) which will be defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalprojector ] ) below .",
    "anyons are labeled by generalized angular momenta , or - in the language of anyons models - ` topological charges ' .",
    "these generalized angular momenta correspond to quantum numbers , just as in the case of ordinary spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the notion of combined spin , or tensor product of spins , corresponds to the notion of ` fusion ' in the language of anyons , and can in general result in more than one type of anyon .",
    "the possible outcomes are called ` fusion channels ' . the generalization of the heisenberg interaction for spins to the anyonic case is to assign an energy to two interacting anyons based on their fusion channel .",
    "how this is done in practice , will be described in more detail below and in appendix  [ app : hamiltonians ] .",
    "the class of anyons considered in this paper is derived from su(2 ) where spin-@xmath61 ranges from @xmath62 .",
    "in contrast , su(2)@xmath0 anyons contain only a subset of generalized angular momenta , namely @xmath63 the truncation , characterized by the ` level ' @xmath3 , has two important consequences which we will describe in the following .",
    "the first consequence concerns the fusion rules of the anyons .",
    "the tensor product of two su(2 ) spins @xmath64 and @xmath65 decomposes as @xmath66 the process of taking tensor products is associative , and the same is true for the fusion rules . because of the truncation in the su(2)@xmath0 theory , the su(2 ) tensor product rule has to be modified .",
    "it turns out that there is only one way of doing this , consistent with the requirement that the fusion rules are associative .",
    "in particular , the fusion rules of su(2)@xmath0 anyons read @xmath67    the second important consequence of the truncation follows from the fusion rules .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space of a number @xmath68 of ordinary su(2 ) spin-@xmath11 s is equal to @xmath69 , and the spins can add up to a maximum spin of @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the dimension of the hilbert space of a number @xmath68 of @xmath71 anyons in the su(2)@xmath0 theory is smaller than @xmath69 . in appendix  [ app : su2k - anyons ]",
    ", it is shown that the dimension of the hilbert space for @xmath68 @xmath71 anyons grows as @xmath72 , asymptotically for large @xmath68 , where @xmath73 is the so - called _ quantum dimension _ of the @xmath71 anyon . for @xmath74",
    ", this implies that the effective number of degrees of freedom for each anyon is irrational .",
    "this is less mysterious than it sounds : all this is saying is that one can not think of the hilbert space of @xmath68 anyons as a tensor product of @xmath68 one - anyon hilbert spaces .    because the hilbert space does not have a tensor product structure , an alternative description of the state space and the hamiltonian acting on it is needed .",
    "we will describe here how this can be done , but leave the details for the appendices where we also give an explicit description of the hamiltonians studied in this paper .",
    "the hilbert space of a chain of anyons can be described in terms of a so - called ` fusion tree ' . in figure",
    "[ fig : spin1-chain ] , the fusion tree for a chain of ` spin-1 ' anyons is displayed .",
    "the lines in the fusion tree carry a label indicating the type of anyon the line corresponds to .",
    "the lines coming from above correspond to the spin-1 anyons which constitute the chain .",
    "the horizontal lines , labeled by @xmath75 , are the actual degrees of freedom .",
    "the possible ` values ' of the @xmath75 are the same as those of the anyons present in the anyon model , namely @xmath76 , in case of su(2)@xmath0 anyons .",
    "the @xmath75 can not be chosen arbitrarily , but may only take values such that the fusion rules are obeyed at the trivalent points .",
    "for example , the anyon type @xmath77 has to appear in the fusion product of @xmath78 , the anyon type @xmath79 appears in the fusion product @xmath80 , and so on .",
    "each labeling of the fusion tree that is consistent with the fusion rules corresponds to a ( orthonormal ) state in the hilbert space , and these states span this space",
    ".    typically , we will use periodic boundary conditions @xmath81 , which implies that @xmath82 has to appear in the fusion product @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the number of sites of the chain .",
    "states in the hilbert space will be written as @xmath85 .",
    "the hamiltonian assigns an energy based on the fusion channel of two neighboring anyons in the chain .",
    "however , in the above discussed representation of the hilbert space ( see figure  [ fig : spin1-chain ] ) , the fusion channel of two neighboring anyons is not explicit . to remedy this problem",
    ", we employ a local basis transformation which changes the order in which the anyons are fused .",
    "this is permissible because of the associativity of the fusion rules . for ordinary su(2 )",
    "spins , this basis transformation is described in terms of the wigner @xmath86-symbols . in the case of anyons ,",
    "this basis transformation is described by what are known as the @xmath87-symbols .",
    "a detailed discussion of the @xmath87 symbols , as well as explicit representations for su(2)@xmath0 anyons can be found in appendix  [ app : f - symbols ] .",
    "the basis transformation is depicted in figure  [ fig : spin1-basistransformation ] . on the left hand side ,",
    "@xmath77 is fused with a spin-@xmath13 anyon , resulting in @xmath79 , which is subsequently fused with the next spin-@xmath13 anyon , resulting in anyon type @xmath88 . after the basis transformation , one first fuses the two spin-@xmath13 anyons , resulting in @xmath89 , which is fused with @xmath77 , resulting in the anyon type @xmath88 . both bases are equivalent ; however , in the second basis , the fusion channel of the two spin-@xmath13 anyons is explicit , namely @xmath89 .",
    "thus , after performing this basis transformation , one can assign the appropriate energy based on the value of @xmath89 .",
    "subsequently , one transforms back to the original basis .",
    "the operator projecting onto the anyon@xmath90 channel of two neighboring anyons @xmath29 and @xmath91 is thus given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is shorthand for the local basis transformation depicted in figure  [ fig : spin1-basistransformation ] .",
    "the operator @xmath94 projects onto the fusion channel @xmath95 , i.e. , the fusion of two anyons into an anyon of type @xmath30 is penalized with energy @xmath96 , while the other possible fusion channels are assigned @xmath97 .",
    "for explicit matrix representations of @xmath98 we refer to appendix  [ app : hamiltonians ] .",
    "it is important to realize that the form of the projector is universal and applicable to anyonic chains composed of arbitrary types of anyons . changing to a different anyon model",
    "will merely result in a different structure of the hilbert space and different @xmath87-symbols .",
    "in this section , we present a detailed discussion of the ` topological symmetry operator ' .",
    "the hamiltonians considered in this paper commute with the topological symmetry operator , and the associated symmetry plays a crucial role in the analysis of the anyonic chain models . in ` equation ' ,",
    "a chain of type-@xmath30 anyons with periodic boundary conditions is displayed ( in this particular case , @xmath99 ) .",
    "@xmath100{./topsym1}\\ ] ] for each type of anyon @xmath101 , there exists a topological operator @xmath102 .",
    "the action of this operator @xmath102 on the state @xmath103 , displayed in for @xmath99 , can be described as follows .",
    "first , an additional anyon of type @xmath101 is created inside the spine of the fusion tree , as displayed in .",
    "@xmath104{./topsym2}\\ ] ] this additional spin-@xmath101 anyon is ` merged ' with the fusion diagram by applying an @xmath87-matrix , namely , @xmath105 , resulting in the state @xmath106 as depicted in .",
    "@xmath107{./topsym3}\\ ] ] next , one ` moves ' the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon around the ring , by applying additional @xmath87-matrices .",
    "after the first step , one obtains the state @xmath108 as illustrated in .",
    "@xmath109{./topsym4}\\ ] ] another move of this sort gives @xmath110 as shown in .",
    "@xmath111{./topsym5}\\ ] ] finally , after @xmath84 steps , one has come full circle , giving rise to the states @xmath112 as depicted in , for @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath113{./topsym6}\\ ] ] from the general properties of anyon models ( see e.g. ref .",
    "( ) ) , we find that @xmath114 ( the overall topological quantum number of an isolated set of anyons can not change ) .",
    "we can now remove the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon in the same way as we added it , thereby finishing the operation of acting with @xmath102 on the state @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we obtain the expression @xmath115 we can now state the matrix elements of the topological operator @xmath102 in the fusion tree basis @xmath116    the above definition of the topological operator does not depend on whether the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon is encircled by the anyon chain ( as in figures - ) or whether the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon encircles the entire anyon chain .",
    "when using the latter description of the topological operator , one can think of the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon as going around the ` fusion product ' of all the spin-@xmath30 anyons constituting the anyonic chain , or better , encircling the flux through the chain .",
    "this flux through the chain is related to the additional spin-@xmath101 anyon as follows , @xmath117{./topsymev1 } \\hspace{.25 cm } \\raisebox{.65cm}{{\\large $ = \\frac{s_{l , i}}{s_{0,i}}$ } } \\hspace{.25 cm } \\includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{./topsymev2 } \\ , \\label{eq : topsymev}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the flux going through the chain , and the matrix @xmath61 is the modular @xmath61-matrix of the anyon model . for a derivation of eq .  , see e.g. ref .",
    "( ) , and the explicit form of @xmath61 in the case of su(2)@xmath0 anyons is given in appendix  [ app : su2k - anyons ] .",
    "the definition of the topological operator contains elements of the @xmath87 matrices only .",
    "this is also true for the anyonic spin hamiltonians we consider in this paper .",
    "it follows that the operators @xmath102 commute with the hamiltonian and that a topological quantum number can be assigned to all the eigenstates .",
    "this has far reaching consequences for the stability of the critical phases .",
    "excited states which are relevant in the renormalization group sense ( i.e. , have energy smaller than 2 ) may lie in a different topological sector than the ground state and thus do not drive the system into a different phase .",
    "in addition , we will see that the operators @xmath102 play an important role in the zero - energy ground states at the aklt point in the haldane - gapped phase of the spin-@xmath13 models .",
    "we will start our discussion of anyonic quantum spin chains with the anyonic version of the ordinary su(2 ) spin-1 heisenberg chain , which has long been appreciated as one of the paradigmatic spin chain models .",
    "for antiferromagnetic couplings the spin-1 chain is well known to form a gapped phase , in distinction from the gapless spin-1/2 heisenberg chain@xcite .    in the following sections , we discuss in detail the anyonic su(2)@xmath0 deformations of the ordinary su(2 ) spin-1 chain .",
    "we will see that much of the seminal features of the su(2 ) spin-1 chain carry over to these anyonic deformations with a number of new subtleties arising .",
    "one is a dependence of the observed phases and phase diagrams on the deformation parameter @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we find an even / odd effect in @xmath3 for @xmath4 and a distinctive behavior for @xmath25 .",
    "we have therefore split our discussion of the anyonic spin-1 chains into three different sections",
    ". we will address anyonic spin-1 chains with _",

    "even_. finally , an entire section is devoted to a detailed account of the physics for the special case of @xmath25 .        before addressing the physics of the anyonic spin chains we briefly recapitulate the phase diagram of the ordinary su(2 ) spin-1 heisenberg chain .",
    "while the latter is typically discussed as a circle phase diagram in terms of bilinear and biquadratic spin exchange , we will recast the phase diagram in terms of the projector representation in eq .",
    "- the generic representation of anyonic spin chains .",

    "we investigate the phase diagram of our model numerically using exact diagonalization . in our analysis , we follow a standard procedure to determine the conformal field theory describing the behavior of the extended critical regions and the critical points : the numerically obtained spectrum is first shifted ( by some constant offset ) such that the ground state has zero energy zero . the spectrum is then rescaled such that the energy of the lowest lying excitation matches the energy of the lowest lying excitation of the conformal field theory describing the phase .",
    "the so obtained energy spectrum is finally compared to the energy spectra of candidate cfts .",
    "the cft ( if any ) which matches the numerically obtained energy levels is the one describing the system at the angle @xmath154 .",
    "we note that the list of candidate cfts is limited : if the chain is critical , each energy level in the spectrum corresponds to a field in the applicable conformal field theory .",
    "these fields satisfy fusion rules which have to be compatible with the fusion rules of the underlying su(2)@xmath0 theory .",
    "this constraint restricts the candidate conformal field theories that could describe the criticality of anyonic quantum chains .",

    "this shift can be determined from the numerics , and is not fixed by conformal symmetry .",
    "thus , different microscopic realizations of the same conformal field theories can give rise to different values for @xmath169 .    as explained in section  [ sec : top - sym ] , the anyonic spin chains have a topological symmetry ; all the states in the spectrum can therefore be assigned a topological quantum number .",

    "one of the phase boundaries of this phase is located at @xmath152 .",

    "we indicate the locations of the energies of the states corresponding to the primary fields by green squares , while blue crosses correspond the numerically obtained energy levels .",
    "we find good agreement between numerically obtained energy spectra and the @xmath142 parafermion cfts for both the su(2)@xmath170 and su(2)@xmath171 anyon models .",
    "for su(2)@xmath170 , we also indicate the location of a few descendant fields that match the numerical prediction . generally , the identification of descendant fields is more difficult due to finite size effects .",
    "the fields of the @xmath142 parafermion theory carry two labels , @xmath172 that take the values @xmath173 , and @xmath174 .",
