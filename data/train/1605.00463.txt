    "one of the main challenges for the innermost tracking detectors after the upgrade to the hl - lhc with an instantaneous luminosity of up to will be the exposure to high radiation .",
    "the atlas pixel system will be prospectively exposed to particle fluences up to ( 1 mev neutron equivalent )  @xcite . to maximize the hit efficiency and reduce the leakage current and power dissipation after irradiation , thin sensors are being developed .",
    "sensors with a thickness of 100 and 150 were found to reach the same hit efficiency as thicker sensors already at a bias voltage of 300 v shown in fig  [ effthick4 ] .         + a highest hit efficiency of around 97% was obtained for perpendicular incident tracks at a fluence of , the expected fluence for the second layer at hl - lhc  @xcite .",
    "the main inefficiencies are caused by the bias dot and the bias rail , as described in  @xcite for fluences up to . in this",
    "paper , different designs of n - in - p planar hybrid pixel modules are investigated at the expected fluence of the second layer .",
    "alternative biasing structures were implemented in a cis sensor production with thickness and compared to the standard design . to cope with the highest occupancy at hl - lhc , smaller pixel dimensions with respect to the ones presently implemented in the fe - i3 chip ( 50x400 ) and the fe - i4 chip ( 50x250 ) , developed for the atlas insertable b - layer ( ibl ) , are mandatory  @xcite .",
    "the new read - out chip for the atlas pixel systems at hl - lhc is being developed by the cern rd53 collaboration with a pixel cell of 50x50 in the 65 nm cmos technology and is expected to be ready at the beginning of 2017  @xcite .",
    "sensors compatible with this chip have been implemented in a recent mpg - hll pixel production with a thickness of 100 and 150 .",
    "first results on the electrical characterization of these devices will be shown .",
    "in the present design of the atlas pixel sensors it is possible to bias the pixel via the punch - through mechanism with an n@xmath1 implant dot implemented in the pixel cell , connected to the bias ring through an aluminium rail . it has been observed that these structures introduce a loss of efficiency after irradiation  @xcite . to reduce this effect ,",
    "an optimization has been carried out , comparing the performance of the different designs shown in fig .",
    "these were implemented in two fe - i4 compatible sensors in a cis n - in - p production on 6 \" wafers with a thickness of 270 .",
    "the sensors were irradiated to a fluence of and then studied with a beam test at cern sps .",
    "the hit efficiency was determined performing track reconstruction with eutelescope software  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty associated to the efficiency measurements is 0.3% , as estimated in  @xcite .",
    "also at this higher fluence the relative performance remained similar to the one observed at : the bias rail superimposed to the pixel implant as in fig .",
    "[ pts]b yields a higher hit efficiency with respect to the standard geometry .",
    "a still better hit efficiency was found for the common punch - through dot , placed externally to the pixel implant and serving four neighbouring pixels , fig .",
    "this geometry was implemented in a 25x500 pixel cell , still compatible with the fe - i4 chip .",
    "+ at a bias voltage of 500 v a hit efficiency of 93.9% was obtained for the standard design where the new arrangement of the bias rail in the modified design in fig .",
    "[ pts]b improved the hit efficiency to 94.6% .",
    "the common punch - through yields even 96.0% , while it increases to 98.0% at 800 v. these values are about 3% lower than what was obtained at a fluence of",
    ". the smaller pixel dimensions of the future pixel read - out chips are indicated in the pixel cells in fig .",
    "[ pts ] using a 50x50 ( a and b ) and 25x100 ( c ) pixel cell .",
    "a smaller pixel with the current designs would show even lower efficiencies .",
    "therefore , further optimization of the biasing structures is mandatory .",
    "it is planned to repeat the hit efficiency measurements with sensors in a fluence range up to to confirm the better performance observed within the new biasing design .      since modules with small pixel cells are not available yet , the hit efficiency for a 25x100 pixel cell at an irradiation fluence of was estimated based on the existing prototype of the 25x500 pixel cell with the new common punch - through design .",
    "since inefficiencies appear at the edges of the pixel caused by charge sharing as well as by the punch - through structure , the hit efficiencies in the first 40 and in the last 60 were combined to estimate the efficiency for an effective pixel cell of 25x100 .",
    "a value of 95.5% was obtained and is indeed lower compared to the 25x500 pixel cell , but only a bit lower compared to the hit efficiency of 96.5% obtained with the standard implementation of the punch - through in a 50x250 pixel cell .",
    "since smaller pixel cells are challenging for the tracking in high pseudo - rapidity regions ( high @xmath0 ) , the hit efficiency for a cell of 50x50 at @xmath0=2.5 was determined .",
    "fe - i4 modules were placed in the beam at desy and cern sps in such a way that the particles were crossing the pixel along the short side ( 50 ) at an angle of @xmath2=80@xmath3 .",
    "such measurements were previously performed at cern with a 100 thick not irradiated module from the vtt production and at desy with a 200 thick irradiated module from a cis production .",
    "the cluster size along @xmath0 strongly depends on the sensor thickness : thinner sensors produce smaller clusters and result in a lower pixel occupancy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] .",
    "there was no possibility to reconstruct tracks for these data sets , implying that the analysis needs to be performed using the hit information of the long clusters compatible with the hypothesis a single particle passing through the sensor .",
    "given the particle path of approximately 50 in each pixel cell , a collected charge of 3100 e was estimated  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a dedicated tuning was performed with a low target threshold of 1000 e. a not irradiated 200 thick sensor was recently investigated in a beam test at cern sps again at @xmath2=80@xmath3 .",
    "an average cluster size of 20 pixels was reconstructed , slightly less than the expected value of 23 - 24 .",
    "this was due to a misplacement of 2@xmath3 of the module with respect to the nominal position .     in the beam ,",
    "as a function of beam incidence angle .",
    "the relationship is also valid for a pixel sensor with a 50x50 cell at high @xmath0 with respect to the beam  @xcite.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]     + the collected charge is shown in fig .",
    "[ highphi ] for the different pixels belonging to the cluster .",
    "it is almost constant over the sensor depth , except for the entrance and exit pixels that are not entirely crossed by the track .",
    "the obtained hit efficiency of a single pixel for the 200 thick sensor is 94.9% and hence it is ( 4 - 5)% lower than the one of 100 thickness presented in  @xcite .",
    "the hit efficiency was calculated with varying assumptions on the allowed number of holes between two pixels inside the cluster , up to a maximum of 10 .",
    "the single hit inefficiency is the total number of holes divided by the cluster length not including the entrance and exit pixels that are 100% efficient by construction .    .",
    "the pixel number equal to zero correspond to the sensor back - side and 20 to the sensor front - side.,scaledwidth=28.0% ]",
    "new pixel cells were designed , compatible with the 50x50 grid of the read - out chip being developed by the rd53 collaboration : one with the same cell size and an alternative version with 25x100 . for both designs",
    "the best performing biasing structures were combined .",
    "the common punch - through design was chosen together with the bias rail running as much as possible superimposed to the pixel implant .",
    "both new layouts , displayed in fig .  [ newdesign ] , have been implemented in the recent mpg - hll production described in the next section .          at cis ,",
    "an innovative method was explored to produce thin sensors without the use of a handle wafer .",
    "the technology employs anisotropic koh etching to create backside cavities in the wafer leaving thicker frames around each single structure .",
    "[ thinningcis ] describes the process flow , starting from the partial front - side processing of 525 thick wafers and continuing with the cavity etching and the implantation of a p@xmath1 layer on the back - side and the p - spray on the front - side followed by a common thermal annealing .",
    "the processing finishes with the last metallization and passivation steps on the front - side  @xcite .",
    "the individual thinning steps are shown in fig .",
    "[ thinningcis ] .",
    "thanks to the optimized procedure , only small thickness fluctuations in the cavities were measured , up to a maximum value of 10 , even over the large surface of the quad sensors , see fig .",

    "they show very low currents below 10 na .",
    "the breakdown voltages are in the range of 150 - 250 v and well above the depletion voltage measured to be 15 - 20 v.",
    "pixel modules were investigated for the upgrade of the atlas pixel system at hl - lhc . it has been shown that the main inefficiency regions coincide with the biasing structure of the pixel implants on the sensor front side . new punch - through structures with an external bias dot , common for four pixel cells and a new arrangement of the bias rail ,",
