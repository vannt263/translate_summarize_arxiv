    "this demonstrates that the change in both the populations and the coherences plays a crucial role in the flow of information between the system and the environment .",

    "we conclude that the measure for non - markovianity is positive , @xmath65 , if and only if the dynamical map is nondivisible .",
    "a positive measure for non - markovianity is not only linked to a breakdown of the divisibility of the dynamical map , but also to the emergence of a negative rate in the corresponding master equation .",

    "the maximum of the measure was obtained for the initial states @xmath95 and @xmath96 , i.e. for the invariant ground state and the excited state .",
    "the difference in the maximization for the resonant and the off - resonant case arises from the fact that the rate at which the populations and the coherences initially decay is much larger for the resonant case .",
    "consequently , the growth of the trace distance occurs after the excited state population and the coherences have reached the value zero . after this point , the increase of the coherences yields the dominant contribution to the increase of the trace distance .",

    "the flow of information is characterized by the change of the distinguishability between a pair of quantum states which , in turn , is linked to the change of the trace distance between these states . we have also argued why the trace distance represents the most suitable distance measure for quantum states to be used in this context .",
    "furthermore , since we have developed a genuine quantitative measure , the results presented here also allow to compare the degree of non - markovianity of different types of physical systems .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a nonzero measure for non - markovianity requires the dynamical map to be nondivisible , a property which is thus necessary for the presence of memory effects in the open system dynamics .",
    "it has also been shown that markovian semigroups and time - dependent markov processes are divisible and , hence , lead to @xmath43 .",
    "the examples discussed here illustrate how the measure can be calculated for a given open system dynamics and that a nonzero measure for non - markovianity is linked to the emergence of negative decay rates in the corresponding master equation .",
    "our measure for non - markovianity has a clear operational meaning based on the interpretation of the trace distance in terms of the distinguishability of states , and suggests various ways to experimentally decide whether a system under study is non - markovian .",
    "the measurement scheme discussed here has the great advantage that it does not presuppose any knowledge about the structure of the environment or about the system - environment interaction and , therefore , also gives valuable information on the theoretical modelling of the open system dynamics . if , for example , a substantial increase of the trace distance is observed experimentally , a mathematical description of the dynamics through any equation describing a markovian or time - dependent markovian process is excluded .",
    "this shows that our measure is a useful tool for the characterization of non - markovianity , both in experiments on open systems and in their theoretical analysis and modelling .",
    "we have argued that the characteristics of the information exchange between the system and its environment determine the degree of non - markovian behavior in an open system .",
    "this exchange of quantum information has been defined here in very general terms through the change of the distinguishability of quantum states , and does not presuppose anything about the specific physical carriers of the information , e.g. , energy or particles . moreover , the measure does not depend on any specific representation of the open system s dynamics .",
    "it therefore opens the possibility to compare and assess different mathematical formulations of dynamical processes in their ability to describe memory effects , in order to understand better the mathematical description of non - markovian quantum dynamics .        here",
