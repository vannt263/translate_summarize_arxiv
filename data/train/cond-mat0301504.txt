    "the internet and the world wide web ( www ) , the electricity power grid , networks of flight connections , of social contacts , and neuronal networks of the brain are few of the many examples of networks that surround us and that may be usefully described as graphs  @xcite .",
    "graph theory is rooted in the 18th century , beginning with the work of euler .",
    "early efforts focused on properties of special ( and usually small ) graphs . in the 1960s ,",
    "paul erds and alfrd rnyi  @xcite initiated the study of _ random graphs _ , known also as er graphs .",
    "the unlimited size and randomness of er graphs made them natural contenders for models of large networks encountered in everyday life .    in 1967",
    "the psychologist stanley milgram asked himself how many acquaintances , on average , connect between a person on the east coast and another on the west coast of the usa .",
    "following some research he finally concluded that the number of acquaintances is surprisingly small , just about six  @xcite .",
    "this celebrated `` six degrees of separation '' achieved widespread popularity .",
    "it was later realized that an average short path , typically of order @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the number of nodes , or the _ size _ of the network ) , connects between randomly selected nodes in most naturally occurring networks .",
    "recognizing milgram s contribution the effect came to be known as the _ small world _",
    "property of networks .",
    "er graphs possess the small world property .",
    "however , an important ingredient was still missing . in networks of social contact",
    "the people that are connected to a certain individual ( such as family , acquaintances at work , and friends ) are highly likely to be connected among themselves .",
    "this high degree of _ clustering _ is absent in er graphs .",
    "_ small world networks",
    "_ , introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite , exhibit high degrees of clustering as well as the small world property .",
    "they mark an important stage in the modeling of everyday networks and are studied in their own right .",
    "it was recently realized that in addition to a high clustering index and the small world property real life networks exhibit yet a third important characteristic : a _ scale - free _ degree distribution .",
    "the _ degree _ of node @xmath2 is the number of links , @xmath3 , connected to the node .",
    "the likely degree of the various nodes in most observed networks follows a power - law distribution : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an appropriate normalization factor , @xmath6 is the minimal degree of any given node , and the cutoff degree @xmath7 depends on the size of the network , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the term _ scale - free _ refers to the fact that the moments @xmath9 for @xmath10 do not exist(diverge ) , in the limit of @xmath11 .",
    "scale - free networks possess the small world property , and it is possible to construct them with a high degree of clustering .",
    "many important examples follow this pattern , including the internet  @xcite and the www ( both for incoming and outgoing links )  @xcite , social networks , and virtually any large network arising in some natural context .",
    "see  @xcite , for excellent reviews , and  @xcite , for a timely anthology .",
    "an oft - neglected aspect in the modeling of everyday - life networks is the fact that they are embedded in physical ( euclidean ) space and possess a _ geography _",
    ", in addition to their _",
    "topology_. the spatial location of nodes and the length of the connecting links is never a consideration in the models of networks discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , routers of the internet and social networks lay on the two - dimensional surface of the globe ; neuronal networks in brains occupy three - dimensional space , etc . the likelihood of connections between the nodes in such networks is certainly affected by their geographical proximity , and one expects nontrivial consequences arising from this interplay between geography and topology  @xcite",
    "yet , most studies so far have focused on topological networks , where the nodes and links exist in some abstract space , devoid of metric .    in this paper",
    "we consider the embedding of networks in euclidean space . in section  [ general ] ,",
    "we discuss general aspects of embedding and introduce a specific algorithm for the embedding of random networks of arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "this algorithm favors connections to nearest nodes and economizes on the total length of the links .",
    "we show that infinite networks can be thus embedded if and only if the degree ditribution has compact support , that is , provided that there exists a sharp upper cutoff @xmath12 for the degree of any given node .",
    "if the distribution has no compact support , then embedding introduces an artificial cutoff and is only possible in a restricted sense . in section",
    "[ scale - free ] we apply the embedding algorithm to the widespread case of scale - free networks and study key structural properties of the resulting lattices .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of open work and a comparison to an interesting related algorithm , proposed by warren , sander , and sokolov  @xcite , in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "our general problem is that of embedding a given infinite graph in euclidean space .",
    "suppose first that the graph contains no cycles ( loops ) , i.e. , it is a tree .",
    "let the volume of a node be @xmath13 . the total volume of nodes within chemical shell @xmath14 ( nodes up to @xmath14 links away from a given node ) increases as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the average degree of the nodes . on the other hand , the volume enclosed within a euclidean distance @xmath17 scales as @xmath18 ( in @xmath19-dimensions ) .",
    "unless the links become progressively long , the exponential growth in @xmath14 can not be sustained within the much slower algebraic growth in @xmath17 .",
    "if the network is to be statistically homogeneous , a lengthening of successive links is unacceptable .",
    "we conclude that infinite trees , such as the cayley tree ( fig  [ cayley - hex]a),are not embeddable in euclidean space  @xcite . allowing for loops ,",
    "the volume constraint is reduced to the extent that embedding might be possible while retaining homogeneity , and without a change in the degree distribution .",
    "an example is shown in fig  [ cayley - hex]b .    ) without loops .",
    "it can not be embedded in euclidean space , unless one allows for loops : the hexagonal lattice  ( b ) is one example of embedding achieved in this way .",
    "notice that the degree distribution remains unchanged.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] ) without loops .",
    "it can not be embedded in euclidean space , unless one allows for loops : the hexagonal lattice  ( b ) is one example of embedding achieved in this way .",
    "notice that the degree distribution remains unchanged.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to make further headway we restrict ourselves to _ random _ graphs , of arbitrary degree distribution @xmath20 , and the following embedding algorithm  @xcite .",
    "to each site @xmath2 of a @xmath19-dimensional lattice assign a random connectivity @xmath3 , taken from the degree distribution @xmath20 .",
    "select site @xmath21 at random and connect it to its closest neighbors , until its preassigned connectivity @xmath22 is realized , or until all sites within distance @xmath23 have been explored . a link to site @xmath14",
    "is allowed provided that : ( a )  the site is not saturated ( its connectivity has not yet reached the preassigned @xmath24 ) , and ( b )  its distance from site @xmath21 is smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "repeat for all sites .",
    "this algorithm makes sense in the context of social networks , where connections are typically confined to one s immediate neighborhood .",
    "the implied economy in the physical length of links might render the algorithm useful for the modeling of other networks of interest .",
    "suppose that one attempts to embed an infinite network , of degree distribution @xmath20 , in an infinite lattice , by the above algorithm .",
    "nodes with a connectivity larger than a certain cutoff @xmath26 can not be realized , because of the possible saturation of surrounding sites .",
    "consider the number of links @xmath27 entering a generic node from a surrounding neighborhood of radius @xmath17 .",
    "sites at distance @xmath28 are linked to the node with probability @xmath29 thus , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface area of the @xmath19-dimensional unit sphere . reversing the order of integration and carrying out the spatial integral",
    ", we obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume of the @xmath19-dimensional unit sphere . finally ,",
    "taking the limit @xmath34 , we derive the cutoff @xmath35    we distinguish between two cases for the degree distribution @xmath20 : with and without compact support .",
    "the distribution @xmath20 has compact support if there exists a @xmath12 such that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "all finite networks have a distribution with compact support , however infinite networks might too have compact support ( an example is the cayley tree of fig .",
    "[ cayley - hex]a ) . if this is the case , then @xmath38 is finite , and one can always select @xmath39 large enough so that @xmath40 . in other words , _ if there is compact support the network is embeddable_.    if the network is infinite and without compact support , then if @xmath41 , for any finite @xmath39 the cutoff @xmath42 is finite and the tail of the distribution for @xmath43 is chopped off .",
    "( infinite networks with diverging @xmath44 are pathological we are not aware of any important practical application  though they might be embeddable . )",
    "the cutoff connectivity @xmath42 implies a cutoff length @xmath45 the embedded network displays the original ( chopped ) distribution up to lengthscale @xmath46 and repeats , statistically , at lengthscales larger than @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , @xmath46 is analogous to the correlation length in percolation theory , above criticality , where the infinite cluster is _ fractal _ for @xmath47 and is homogeneous for @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the cutoff @xmath42 is of consequence even if the distribution @xmath20 is narrow , that is , even if @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , even in such a case the lengthscale @xmath46 is finite ( and controlled mainly by  @xmath39 ) .",
    "in summary , finite networks ( all practical situations ) are always embeddable by ourproposed algorithm .",
    "infinite networks are strictly embeddable only if their degree distribution has compact support .",
    "otherwise , they are embeddable in a restricted manner , with a cutoff @xmath42 imposed by the embedding , and statistical repetition at lengthscales @xmath50 .",
    "we now apply the embedding algorithm to the widespread case of scale - free networks , eq .",
    "( [ pscale - free ] ) .",
    "generally , we consider embedding in @xmath19-dimensional lattices of size @xmath51 , though in the numerical simulations shown below we limit ourselves to two - dimensional square lattices with periodic boundary conditions . because the lattice has a finite number of sites , @xmath52 , the degree distribution  ( [ pscale - free ] ) has compact support  @xcite : @xmath53 this , in conjunction with  ( [ r - k ] ) , implies a natural cutoff length @xmath54    the interplay between the three lengthscales , @xmath51 , @xmath46 , @xmath55 , determines the nature of the network .",
    "the embedding cutoff @xmath42 is imposed only if @xmath56 , and there is statistical repetition for @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise ( @xmath57 ) , the natural cutoff of @xmath7 is attained .",
    "as long as @xmath58 , the finite size of the lattice imposes no serious restrictions .",
    "otherwise ( @xmath59 ) , finite - size effects become important . in short , there exist @xmath60 different regimes , characterized by the relative ordering of @xmath51 , @xmath46 , and @xmath55 : regime a : @xmath61 .",
    "natural cutoff @xmath7 is attained , and no finite - size effects .",
    "statistical repetition occurs at lengthscales @xmath62 , rather than @xmath46 .",

    "[ distrib]a , various values of @xmath39 were selected such that @xmath56 , and the distribution terminates at the imposed cutoff @xmath42 .",
    "the scale - free distribution is altered slightly , for @xmath76 , due to saturation effects , but the overall trend is highly consistent with the original power - law .",

    "we now turn to the relation between the euclidean metric and chemical length in our embedded scale - free networks .",
    "the chemical distance @xmath14 between two sites is the minimal number of links @xmath14 connecting the two .",

    "infinite networks are strictly embeddable only if the degree distribution has compact support . if not , an artificial cutoff @xmath42 results from our embedding technique , and the networkrepeats itself , in a statistical sense , at lengthscales greater than @xmath104 .",
    "we have applied our embedding algorithm to scale - free graphs , and studied the resulting networks .    concurrently with our work ( and independently ) , warren , sander and sokolov  @xcite proposed an embedding algorithm very similar to ours .",
    "the main difference in their approach is that connecting to saturated sites is allowed , and a node is connected to as many of its closest neighbors as necessary , until its target connectivity is fulfilled . in this case , our computation of @xmath42 in section  [ general ] is still valid , only that now it is a _ lower _",
    "cutoff for the connectivity of the sites . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no restriction , in this version of embedding , on the upper cutoff of the distribution .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath46 here plays the role of a ` geometrical ' lengthscale , similar to the lattice spacing for a critical percolation cluster grown on a lattice .",
    "( the cluster is self - similar only at lengthscales larger than the lattice spacing . )",
    "embedding scale - free networks in euclidean space results in some dramatic changes from the original graphs .",
    "consider , for example , the small world property , common to off - lattice scale - free networks grown by any of the known techniques .",
    "the small world property disappears at lengthscales greater than @xmath46 : two sites separated by a physical distance @xmath105 , @xmath106 , would be connected by at least @xmath107 intervening links , due to the statistical repetition .",
    "the number of sites withinradius @xmath17 is @xmath108 , so @xmath109 .",
    "not surprisingly , this is the same scaling as for euclidean @xmath19-dimensional lattices . for distances @xmath47 , wehave @xmath110 , which represents small - world behavior , since it improves on the euclidean @xmath109 , but a far cry from the off - lattice @xmath111 .",
    "another example of a dramatic change is the qualitative difference between percolation inoff - lattice and embedded networks . indeed , warren et al .",
    ",  @xcite find that the percolation transition takes place in embedded lattices even for @xmath112 , in contrast to off - lattice scale - free networks  @xcite . in view of the fact that many everyday - life networks are embedded in physical space ,",
    "we ought to reconsider how the topological properties of scale - free graphs  properties that we normally attribute to the physical networks  are affected by the embedding .",
