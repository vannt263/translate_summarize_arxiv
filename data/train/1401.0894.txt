    "in recent years , there has been a growing need for including uncertainty in mathematical models and quantifying its effect on outputs of interest used in decision making .",
    "this is the well known uncertainty quantification ( uq ) . in general , a probabilistic setting can be used to include these uncertainties in mathematical models . in a such framework ,",
    "the input data are modeled as random variables , or more generally , as random fields with a given correlation structure .",
    "thus , the goal of the mathematical and computational analysis becomes the prediction of statistical moments of the solution or statistics of some quantities of physical interest of the solution , given the probability distribution of the input random data .",
    "a fundamental problems in uq is to approximate a multivariate function @xmath0 with random parameters @xmath1 where @xmath2 might be a solution resulting from a stochastic pde problem or other kinds of complex model .",
    "numerical methods for such problems have been well developed in recent years : see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "a popular approach that has received considerable attention is the generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) method @xcite , which is the generalization of the wiener - hermite polynomial chaos expansion developed in @xcite . in gpc methods ,",
    "one expands the solution in polynomials of the input random variables .",
    "this method exhibits high convergence rates with increasing order of the expansion , provided that solutions are sufficiently smooth with respect to the random variables .",
    "however , in traditional  intrusive \" gpc approaches , solvers for the resulting coupled deterministic equations are often needed , which can be very complicated if the underlying differential equations have nontrivial and nonlinear forms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    to efficiently build a gpc approximation",
    ", one could also consider a discrete least squares projection onto a polynomial space .",
    "the least squares approach using different types of sampling grids ( such as randomly generated points , quasi - monte carlo points , etc ) has already been proposed in the framework of uq , and has been explored in several contexts @xcite .",
    "one can also find comparisons between the use of random samples , quasi - monte carlo points and sparse grid points @xcite .",
    "the corresponding numerical analysis for the least squares approach with random samples is also addressed in much of the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "for bounded measures , the authors proved an optimal convergence estimate ( up to a logarithmic factor ) for the one dimension case , provided the number of samples scales quadratically with the dimension of the polynomial space . using different techniques",
    ", the authors of @xcite proved a more general result .",
    "in particular , the approach in @xcite is not limited to polynomial spaces .",
    "we remark that in @xcite , the convergence results are in probability , e.g , convergence with high probability or convergence in expectation , and such conditions on convergence are inescapable when random samples are used .",
    "the aim of this paper is to employ specially designed _ deterministically _ generated points to approximate multivariate functions by a discrete least squares projection , which is different from other works where random points ( with noisy or noise - free data ) are used .",
    "our deterministic points are inspired by one of andr weil s theorems in number theory .",
    "not only are our deterministic points easy to compute and store , but also the corresponding analysis is also _ deterministic _",
    "( convergence is not qualified by a probabilistic condition ) . in our approach ,",
    "weil s theorem guarantees that the use of design points results in a good regression matrix , and thus guarantees stability .",
    "more precisely , by considering the chebyshev polynomial approximation , we prove stability and an optimal convergence estimate , provided that the number of points scales quadratically with the dimension of the polynomial space .",
    "we also show the application of such an approach for quantifying the epistemic uncertainties in parameterized problems . using hermann weyl s equidistribution criterion from diophantine approximation , we are able to conclude that the geometric distribution of the deterministic grid converges weakly to the tensor - product arcsine ( chebyshev ) measure .",
    "this results allows us to extend the chebyshev polynomial approximation to more general polynomial approximations by considering the weighted least squares framework .",
    "numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of our deterministic sampling method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the problem of approximating a function in @xmath3 underlying variables by discrete least squares projection onto a polynomial space . some common choices of high dimensional polynomial spaces are described and the deterministic collocation points are introduced . in section 3 , by considering chebyshev polynomial approximations , we prove the stability and convergence properties for the proposed numerical method .",
    "we then extend the approach in section 3 to general polynomial approximations by considering the weighted least squares approach .",
    "several numerical examples are given in section 4 to confirm the theoretical results .",
    "we finally give some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we follow closely the notations of @xcite and give a basic introduction for the discrete least squares approach .",

    ". for high dimensional least squares approaches , randomly generated samples are often used , e.g. , one generates the collocation points in a monte carlo fashion with respect to the pdf of the random variable @xcite . unlike the traditional random sampling approach , we will discuss the use of _ deterministically _ generated samples .",

    "an observation worth noting is that the quadratic rule ( figure [ fig : condnumber - td ] , right ) admits decay properties of the condition number with respect to @xmath45 , even with a relatively small scaling @xmath266 .",
    "in contrast , the linear rule ( figure [ fig : condnumber - td ] ) admits a growth of the condition number with respect to the polynomial order @xmath45 ( @xmath267 dotted lines ) .",
    "however , when a relative large @xmath268 is used ( @xmath269 solid lines ) , the problem becomes much better conditioned .",
    "this shows that our analysis in theorem [ th : stablility ] might not be optimal , and the linear rule with a relative large coefficient @xmath268 seems enough in practice to obtain stability .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors indeed proved that linear scaling is enough to guarantee stability when working with monte carlo - generated points from the chebyshev measure .",
    "such a result does not directly extend to our setting because our grid is deterministic .",
    "the results for the two dimensional tp space are shown in figure [ fig : condnumber - tp ] .",
    "again , the left plot is for the linear scaling @xmath264 and the right plot is for the quadratic scaling @xmath257 we observe similar results when compared to the td space results of figure [ fig : condnumber - td ] .",
    "condition numbers for linear scaling in higher dimensional cases are also provided in figure [ fig : condnumber - td - highd ] .",
    "we observe that a linear rule with a large coefficient @xmath268 might still guarantee stability for high dimensional problems .      now , we test the accuracy of our method by measuring the convergence rate with respect to the number of collocation points .",
    "we measure the error in the @xmath270 norm , computed as the discrete norm on a set of 2000 points that are independent samples from a uniform distribution .",
    "we use the target function @xmath271 where the parameters @xmath272 are generated randomly .",

    "obtained with linear scaling @xmath264 and the right - hand pane shows quadratic scaling @xmath273 for reference .",
    "the results from figure [ fig : convergence - rates - td - d2 ] show both the linear rule and the quadratic rule display the exponential convergence with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "the convergence stagnates at machine precision , which is expected .",
    "however , one can observe that the error for linear rule with random points with small @xmath268 ( @xmath274 squares with dotted line ) exhibits some erratic behavior .    the convergence results in two dimensional td space are shown in figure [ fig : convergence - rates - tp - d2 ] .",
    "the results are similar to figure [ fig : convergence - rates - td - d2 ] .",
    "numerical tests for other target functions ( in the four - dimensional td space ) are also provided in figure [ fig : convergence - rates - td - d4 ] .",
    "the left pane uses the target function @xmath275 while the right pane uses the target function @xmath276 .",
    "we notice that the convergence rates depend closely on the regularity of the target function , as expected .",
    "the results above suggest that the linear rule is enough to obtain the best expected convergence rate .",
    "the convergence result of theorem [ th : convergence ] leverages the stability results from theorem [ th : stablility ] , and therefore the analysis might not be optimal with respect to scaling @xmath258 versus @xmath265 .",
    "one might be able to loosen the assumptions theorem [ th : convergence ] and obtain the same result without relying on the quadratic - scaling stability proven in theorem [ th : stablility ] ; this investigation is the subject of current ongoing work .",
    "we now work with the uniform measure  our basis functions @xmath277 are tensor - product legendre polynomials .",
    "although corollary [ co : measure ] implies that the approximation using chebyshev polynomials is efficient , one might prefer to use other polynomial approximations and the legendre approximation , corresponding to unweighted @xmath270-approximation is a prime candidate for investigation . as discussed in section [ sec : weighted - ls ] , the weighted least squares approach will be used for non - chebyshev approximations .",
    "we will compare the performance of the deterministic points and monte carlo random points generated from the uniform measure . in our plots , we denote by _ pre deterministic _ results obtained using our deterministic weil points @xmath64 , and by _ pre random _ the results obtained from uniform - measure monte carlo collocation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have suggested to use the standard ( unweighted ) least squares approach with uniformly distributed randomly - generated points . for the purposes of comparison",
    ", we will display numerical results for that method , and these results are referred to as _",
    "direct random_.    in figure [ fig : condnumber - td - legendre ] , condition numbers with respect to the polynomial order @xmath45 in the two - dimensional td space are shown using linear scaling @xmath256 . the left plot shows the scaling @xmath267 while the right plot uses the scaling @xmath278 the corresponding results for the two dimensional tp space are shown in figure [ fig : condnumber - tp - legendre ] , where again the left - hand plot uses scaling @xmath267 and the right - hand plot uses scaling @xmath279 it is clear that _ direct random _ approach ( dotted line with squares ) admits an undesirable ( apparently exponential ) growth of the condition number with respect to the polynomial order .",
    "however , the weighted approach results in condition number behavior that is similar to the chebyshev approximation . namely , the linear rule ( with a reasonably large @xmath268 ) results in an almost - bounded condition number .",
    "the corresponding convergence results are shown in figure [ fig : convergence - legendre ] , both for the the td space ( left ) and the tp space ( right ) .",
    "we observe that linear scaling for _ direct random _ ( squares ) exhibist convergence deterioration for increasing polynomial order .",
    "this deterioration is due to the ill - conditioning of the design matrix for large @xmath45 .",
    "these results are consistent with what is shown in @xcite , where the authors claim that a quadratic scaling of @xmath258 versus @xmath265 is needed when working with the uniform measure using uniformly - distributed monte carlo points . in constrast our weighted approach ( star plots )",
    "displays a stable , exponential convergence with linear scaling .",
    "essentially , the weighted approach inherits all the advantages of the chebyshev approximation .",
    "in this work , we discuss the problem of approximating a multivariate function by discrete least - square projection onto a polynomial space using specially designed _ deterministic _ points that are motivated by a theorem due to andr weil . the intended application is parametric uncertainty quantification where solutions are parameterized by random variables .    in our approach",
    ", stability and optimal convergence estimates are shown using the chebyshev basis and approximation , provided the number of collocation points scales quadratically with the dimension of the polynomial space .",
    "we also indicate the possible application of derived results for quantifying epistemic uncertainties where the density function of the parametric random variable is not entirely determined .",
    "extensions to general polynomial approximations are discussed by considering a weighted least squares approach .",
    "we prove that the deterministic weil points distribute asympototically according to the tensor - product chebyshev measure , and this knowledge allows us to prescribe the least squares weights in an explicit fashion .",
    "numerical comparisons between our deterministic points and random ( monte carlo ) points are provided .",
    "we observe that the deterministic points work as well as randomly generated chebyshev points .",
    "the numerical results also suggest that for legendre approximations using our weil points , using the weighted approach is superior to standard ( unweighted ) least squares approaches .    in this work ,",
