    "the superconducting fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase is characterized by the nonzero total momentum of the cooper pairs . according to the original idea , proposed by fulde and ferrel  @xcite as well as independently by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite",
    ", the nonzero momentum pairing appears in the presence of external magnetic field as a consequence of the fermi wave vector mismatch between particles from two spin subbands with opposite momenta .",

    "the difficulties in experimental observation of the fflo state are caused by the stringent conditions for its appearance .",

    "the multiband effects caused by the confinement lead to the thickness - dependent oscillations of the superconducting properties ( shape resonanses ) .",
    "so far , the thickness - dependent oscillations of the energy gap  @xcite , critical temperature  @xcite , and critical magnetic field  @xcite have been experimentally observed , as well as theoretically studied . in spite of the mutiband behavior of a variety of superconductors , such as mgb@xmath1 or the iron - based superconductors  @xcite ,",

    "@xcite it has been found that a competing effect can arise from the coupling in two bands each of which has their own favorable momentum of the cooper pairs .",

    "we have shown that the shape resonance conditions are detrimental to the fflo phase formation . as a consequence , the magnetic field for which the fflo state is stable oscillates as a function of the film thickness with the phase shift equal to one half of the period corresponding to the critical magnetic field oscillations . moreover",

    "[ fig1 ] . based on these results",

    "the wave vector mismatch ( induced by the zeeman spin splitting ) , which corresponds to different subbands , may vary significantly . as a consequence",
    ", each subband has its own favorable value of the cooper pair total momentum @xmath80 .",
    "however , the situation in which there is a number of independent modulation vectors @xmath80 simultaneously , each corresponding to a different subband , can not be realized in the system because all the subband gap parameters @xmath51 are coupled ( c.f .",
    "[ eq : delta_fflo ] ) .",
    "since there can be only one value of the cooper pair total momentum in the system , a competition between the subbands appears . for the resonant thicknesses",
    "there is one leading quasi - particle branch @xmath81 ( with the energy gap @xmath82 ) which is responsible for the enhancement of the paired phase  @xcite .",
    "its dominant influence on the formation of the superconducting state results form the high density of states at the fermi level which appears each time when the bottom of a subband is close to the fermi level .",
    "however , the closer to the fermi level the bottom of a subband is , the grater is the wave vector mismatch which corresponds to this subband in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "therefore , for the leading quasi - particle branch the favored cooper pair momentum @xmath83 is significantly greater than the ones which correspond to the remaining bands , as schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . due to this fact it is not possible to adjust a single cooper pair total momentum in order to compensate all the wave vector mismatches , what leads to the suppression of the fflo phase . on the other hand , for the film thicknesses for which the resonance conditions are not fulfilled ( non - resonant thickness )",
    ", the contribution to the superconducting bcs phase coming form all the subbands is comparable . since the energies corresponding to the bottoms of all the subbands are far below the fermi level the total momenta of the cooper pairs @xmath80 which compensate the wave vector mismatches for all the subbands differ only slightly as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "in such situation it is possible to adjust the @xmath72 vector to compensate each fermi wave vector mismatch to a large extent . in this case",

    "this dominant resonant subband leads to the enhancement of the energy gap [ compare fig.[fig6](b ) and ( d ) ] and is detrimental to the fflo state formation .",
    "on the other hand , for the non - resonant thickness @xmath79  ml the three subbands are far below the fermi energy .",
    "since they have comparable total momentum of the cooper pairs the adjustment of a single @xmath72 vector for all the bands is possible giving raise to the fflo state stability region .",
    "as it has already been mentioned for the case of multiband superconductors the competing effect leads to a complex structure of the fflo state stability region , which is divided into @xmath87 subregions , with @xmath87 being the number of superconducting subbands .",

    "[ fig7 ] one can distinguish between three fflo phases , labeled by fflo-@xmath26 ( n=1,2,3 ) . for a given fflo-@xmath26 phase the total momentum @xmath72 of the cooper pairs is mainly determined by the fermi wave vector mismatch in the @xmath26-th band .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the rest of non - resonant thicknesses . in fig .",

    "further increase of the thickness makes the orbital effect more relevant what is detrimental to the fflo state formation . due to the orbital effect the range of the magnetic field in which the fflo state exists gradually decreases with increasing film thickness and for @xmath29 greater than @xmath91  ml",
    "this phase completely disappears .",
    "the multiband effects on the fflo state induced by the in - plane magnetic field in pb(111 ) nanofilms has been investigated in the framework of the bcs theory .",
    "we have studied the interplay between the fflo phase and the shape resonances , as well as the influence of the multiband and orbital effects on its stability .",
    "we have found that for the resonant thicknesses the fflo phase stability region is suppressed due the difference between the fermi wave vector mismatch corresponding the resonant subband and the one corresponding to the remaining subbands . as a consequence ,",
    "the range of the magnetic field for which the fflo phase is stable oscillates as a function of the film thickness with the phase shift equal to one half of the period corresponding to the critical field oscillations .",

    "it is worth mentioning that so far there have been no reports on the fflo phase stability in metallic nanofilms .",
    "this fact is mainly due to the quality of the films most of which are in the dirty limit while the non - zero momentum paired phase is easily destroyed by the nonmagnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "other experimental difficulties such as surface roughness or the magnetic field direction , which has to be applied precisely parallel to the plane , are also detrimental to the fflo phase formation .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope that the technological progress will allow for the fabrication of very clean nanofilms in the future and investigate experimentally some of the effects studied theoretically in this paper .",
