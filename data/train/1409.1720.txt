    "dielectric engineering has been used to achieve the highest mobilities in top gated samples with high-@xmath15 gate dielectrics . in this case , the scattering due to impurities can be drastically suppressed by screening  @xcite and mobilities close to intrinsic phonon - limited mobility of @xmath16  @xmath14/vs can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "the applied bias @xmath17 results in a quasi - equilibrated hot - electron distribution characterized by a temperature @xmath3 larger than the temperature @xmath18 of the crystal lattice . due to",

    "this results in a reduction of the cooling power due to the so - called hot - phonon effect . ]    besides , unlike the conventional semiconductor heterostructures , there is no intrinsic roughness over the 2d plane in atomically thin semiconductors and the absence of surface roughness , in principle , makes it possible to attain still higher mobilities .",
    "efforts are still on going to realize the highest possible room temperature mobilities largely limited by electron - phonon ( el - ph ) scattering .    in photoexcited samples and samples subject to high electric fields ,",
    "electrons are appreciably heated and driven out of equilibrium with the lattice .",
    "this is an important phenomenon as it affects thermal dissipation and heat management which are key issues in nanoscale electronics and will play a role in any future mx@xmath0 based devices .",
    "in addition , hot electrons mediate energy transport which finds applications in variety of devices such as calorimeters , bolometers , infrared and thz detectors , and furthermore gives rise to the photothermoelectric effect observed in monolayer mos@xmath0  @xcite . understanding the important pathways for hot - electron cooling",
    "is thus of high importance .",
    "an important channel for cooling of hot electrons is by energy transfer to the host lattice , i.e. phonons .",
    "hot electrons loose their energy by emission of acoustic phonons at low temperatures and optical phonons at higher temperatures , and the dependence of the hot - electron relaxation on temperature and carrier density can provide useful insight into the mechanisms responsible for their cooling .",

    "this includes intravalley scattering by acoustic phonons via deformation potential and piezoelectric interaction , intravalley scattering by optical phonons via deformation potential and the frhlich interaction , as well as intervalley scattering by both acoustic and optical phonons via deformation potential interaction .",
    "heating of the phonons due to relaxation of hot carriers is included through an explicit solution of the phonon boltzmann equation .",
    "this so - called `` hot - phonon '' effect is important to account for when electronic reabsorption of excited phonons becomes a limiting factor for the hot - electron cooling power .",
    "coupling to surface - polar optical phonons of the substrate / gate dielectric has been demonstrated to be an important factor for the relaxation of hot electrons in supported graphene  @xcite . in monolayer",
    "mos@xmath0 , however , the optical phonon energies are significantly lower compared to those in graphene .",
