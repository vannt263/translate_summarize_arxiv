    "in an introductory course on quantum theory one commonly discusses some of the simplest models , such as , for example : free particle , particle in a box , harmonic oscillator , tunnelling through a square barrier , etc . with the purpose of making the students more familiar with the principles or postulates of quantum theory .",
    "some time ago gibbs@xcite introduced the quantum bouncer as a model for the pedagogical discussion of some of the relevant features of quantum theory .",
    "he derived the solutions to the schrdinger equation in terms of airy functions and obtained the energy spectrum for two different model settings .",
    "a closely related model , the harmonic oscillator with a hard wall on one side , had been discussed earlier by dean@xcite and later by mei and lee@xcite .",
    "this model is as simple as the quantum bouncer and both can therefore be discussed in the same course .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that it may in principle be useful to simulate a particle attached to a wall like , for example , an atom adsorbed on a solid surface@xcite .",
    "although it is an oversimplified one  dimensional model of the actual physical phenomenon we deem it worthwhile to discuss some of its properties in this paper .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model , write the schrdinger equation in dimensionless form , and discuss some of the properties of its solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we obtain the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues explicitly in terms of the well known weber functions@xcite and show the behavior of the eigenvalues and excitation energies with respect to the distance between the particle and the wall .",
    "we also calculate the zero  point energy for values of the model parameters corresponding to de adsorption of h on pd(100)@xcite and outline the application of the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method to the schrdinger equation . finally , is sec .",
    "[ sec : comments ] we give further reasons why this model may be useful in a course on quantum theory .",
    "we consider a simple one  dimensional model for a particle of mass @xmath0 attached to a surface located at @xmath1 that separates free space ( @xmath2 ) from the bulk of the material ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the potential exhibits an attractive tail for @xmath2 that keeps the particle in the neighborhood of the surface and a repulsive one for @xmath3 that prevents the particle from penetrating too deep into the material . since we want to keep the model as simple as possible we choose @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "we note that the particle oscillates about @xmath6 but the motion is not harmonic because of the effect of the hard wall .",
    "the schrdinger equation reads @xmath7 where the boundary condition at @xmath1 comes from the fact that in this simple model the particle can not penetrate into the material and , consequently , @xmath8 for all @xmath3 .",
    "since it is more convenient to work with a dimensionless equation we define the length unit @xmath9 and the dimensionless coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the dimensionless schrdinger equation reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 it is worth noting that @xmath13 increases with @xmath14 , @xmath0 , and @xmath15 .",
    "it is precisely eq .",
    "( [ eq : schr_dim ] ) that was discussed by dean@xcite and mei and lee@xcite .    when @xmath16 we have the well  known harmonic oscillator with eigenvalues @xmath17 on the other hand , when @xmath18 we have the harmonic oscillator in the half line and @xmath19 note that these are merely the harmonic  oscillator eigenvalues with odd quantum number ( the corresponding eigenfunctions have a node at origin ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : de / db_2 ] ) in the appendix that @xmath20 from which we conclude that the energy eigenvalues decrease monotonously between the following limits : @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the number of zeros of @xmath23 remains unchanged as @xmath13 goes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : de / db_2 ] ) is useful for obtaining the asymptotic behavior of the energy as @xmath16 . to this end",
    "we simply integrate it from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 for the ground state we expect that @xmath29 as @xmath16 .",
    "the normalization factor is approximately given by @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the error function .",
    "since @xmath32 we write @xmath33 and expand @xmath34 in a taylor series about @xmath35 : @xmath36 finally , eq .  ( [ eq : e(-q0 ) ] ) yields @xmath37 in order to obtain this result we substituted @xmath38 after the integration and neglected a term proportional to @xmath39 because it is much smaller than the exponential one retained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0(-q0 ) ] ) .",
    "this result agrees with the one derived by mei and lee@xcite by means of perturbation theory ( note that their parameter @xmath40 is @xmath41 ) .",
    "proceeding in the same way for the first excited state we obtain @xmath42 that is slightly different from the result of mei and lee@xcite .",
    "however , they are equivalent for most purposes because the difference between them is smaller than their absolute errors .",
    "( [ eq : virial_2 ] ) gives us the virial theorem@xcite for this model @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the right  hand side of this equation is the virial of the force exerted by the surface .",
    "( [ eq : hv2 ] ) provides us with another interesting relation @xmath45 that clearly reveals the asymmetry of the interaction between the particle and the surface . in both cases",
    "we recover the well  known results for the harmonic oscillator @xmath46 and @xmath47 when @xmath16 .",
    "if we define the new independent variable @xmath48 and write the energy as @xmath49 then we realize that @xmath50 is a solution to the weber equation@xcite @xmath51 the general solution is@xcite",

    "we solve @xmath59 for @xmath0 and then calculate the dimensionless energy @xmath49 .",

    "( [ eq : en_bounds ] ) .",
    "the gap between two consecutive energy levels of the harmonic oscillator is @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "[ fig : de ] shows @xmath64 for @xmath65 where we note that the energy gap increases with @xmath66 revealing that the presence of the wall results in an anharmonic oscillation .",
    "it becomes more harmonic as @xmath13 increases ( by increasing either @xmath14 , @xmath0 or @xmath15 ) .    in order to have a clearer physical idea of the kind of predictions of this simple model we may choose the parameters for the adsorption of hydrogen on pd(100 ) .",
    "gladys et al@xcite estimated @xmath67  and @xmath68 for hydrogen that lead to @xmath69 .",
    "the zero  point energy for such model parameters is approximately @xmath70 instead of the value @xmath71 chosen by those authors .",
    "although they fitted the potential energy of the vertical displacement of the h atom from the pd surface to a cubic polynomial they simply chose the zero  point energy of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "present model predicts that the zero  point energy is slightly greater than the harmonic ",
    "oscillator one because of the repulsive effect of the surface .",
    "we agree that a hard wall may not be the most adequate representation of the short  range interaction between the h atom and the pd surface , but we think that the model is a reasonably simple first approach to the physical phenomenon .",
    "for deuterium we have @xmath72  which , together with the same force constant and about twice the mass , yields @xmath73 and @xmath74 that is closer to the harmonic  oscillator zero  point energy@xcite .",
    "we note the effect of the distance to the surface and the mass of the particle on the vibrational energies .",

    "we do not show results here and simply mention that the calculation is greatly facilitated by the fact that one calculates the integrals @xmath85 and @xmath86 analytically .",
    "the model discussed here is suitable for a course on quantum theory because it does not require much more mathematical background than it is necessary for the discussion of the well known harmonic oscillator or the quantum bouncer@xcite .",
    "it is useful for introducing a numerical calculation of the eigenvalues that the student does not find in the treatment of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "one can approach the problem by means of either the weber functions or the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method .",
    "the student will also learn that it is necessary to modify the form of the well known virial theorem and other mathematical expressions in order to take into account the effect of the wall .",

    "[ sec : model ] and in the appendix is simpler than those available in the scientific literature@xcite .",

    "one introduces nonlinear oscillations by means of cubic , quartic , and other terms of greater degree in the potential  energy function . in this case",
