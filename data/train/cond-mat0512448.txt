    "the bump formations in recurrent neural networks have been recently reported in several investigations concerning linear - threshold units @xcite , binary units @xcite , small - world networks of integrate and fire neurons @xcite and in a variety of spatially distributed neural networks models with excitatory and inhibitory couplings between the cells @xcite .    as has been shown",
    ", the localized retrieval is due to the short - range connectivity of the networks and could explain the behavior in structures of biological relevance as the neocortex , where the probability of connections decreases with the distance @xcite .",
    "in the case of linear - threshold neural network model , the signal - to - noise analysis has been recently adapted @xcite to spatially organized networks and has shown that the retrieval states of the connected network have non - uniform activity profiles when the connections are short - range enough , even without any spatial structure of the stored patterns .",
    "the increase of the gain or the saturation level of neurons enhance the level of localization of the retrieval states and do not lead to a drastic decrease of the storage capacity in these networks even for very localized solutions @xcite .",
    "an interesting investigation of the spontaneous activity bumps in small - world networks ( sw ) @xcite of integrate - and fire neurons @xcite , has recently shown that the network retrieves when its connectivity is close to the random and displays localized bumps of activity , when its connectivity is close to the ordered .",
    "the two regimes are mutually exclusive in the range of the parameter governing the proportion of the long - range connections on the sw topology of integrate - and - fire network , while the two behaviors coexist in the case of linear - threshold and smoothly saturated units .",
    "moreover , it has been stated that the transition between localization and retrieval regimes , in the case of sw networks of integrate - and - fire neurons , can occur at a degree of randomness beyond the sw regime and it is not related , in general , to the sw properties of the network .",
    "the bump formations have been also investigated in spatially distributed neural network models with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic couplings .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that a neural network only with excitatory couplings can exhibit localized activity from an initial transient synchrony of a localized group of cells , followed by desynchronized activity within the group .",
    "this activity may grow or may be reduced when depression with a given size of the frequency of the inputs is introduced .",
    "it is also very sensitive to the initial conditions and the range of the parameters of the network .",
    "the result of bump formations have been recently reported by us , @xcite in the case of binary hebb model for associative network .",
    "we stated out that these spatially asymmetric retrieval states ( sas ) can be observed if an asymmetry between the learning and the retrieval states is imposed .",
    "this means that the network is constrained to have a different activity compared to that induced by the patterns .    in the present investigation",
    "we regard a symmetric and distance dependent connectivity for all neurons within an attractor neural network ( nn ) of hebbian type formed by @xmath0 binary neurons @xmath1 , storing @xmath2 binary patterns @xmath3 .",
    "the connectivity between the neurons is symmetric @xmath4 , where @xmath5 means that neurons @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected .",
    "we are interested only on connectivities in which the fluctuations between the individual connectivity are small , e.g. @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mean connectivity .",
    "the learned patterns are drawn from the following distribution : @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 is the sparsity of the code @xcite .",
    "we study the hopfield model @xcite : @xmath12 with hebbian learning rule @xcite @xmath13 further in this article we will work in terms of variables @xmath14 .    in the case of binary network and",
    "symmetrically distributed patterns , the only asymmetry between the retrieval and the learning states that can be imposed , independent on the position of the neurons , is the total number of the neurons in a given state .",
    "having in mind that there are only two possible states , this condition leads to a condition on the mean activity of the network , which is introduced by adding an extra term @xmath15 to the hamiltonian @xmath16 this term favors states with lower total activity @xmath17 that is equivalent to decrease the number of active neurons , creating asymmetry between the learning and the retrieval states .    for @xmath18",
    ", this model has been intensively studied @xcite and shows no evidence of spatial asymmetric states .",
    "for @xmath19 , the energy of the system increases with the number of active neurons ( @xmath20 ) and the term @xmath15 tends to limit the number of active neurons below @xmath21 .    in the present work",
    "we show explicitly that the constraint on the network level of activity is a sufficient condition for observation of spatially asymmetric states in binary hebb neural network .",
    "similar observations have been reported in the case of linear - threshold network @xcite , where in order to observe bump formations , one has to constrain the activity of the network .",
    "the same is true in the case of smoothly saturating and binary networks @xcite , when the highest activity level , they can achieve , is above the maximum activity of the units in the stored pattern .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss in details the binary neural network model , giving a complete analytical derivation of its properties . we explain the minimal conditions for the formations of spatially asymmetric states in a recurrent network with metrically organized connectivity .",
    "we compare the results for three different topologies of the network and show interesting multi - bump formations in the case of the sw - like topology",
    ". further extension of the analysis to the information , carried by the network , reveals that the retrieved states can be well recovered by a limited amount of information .",
    "we show that the stability of the network s retrieval , when starting from the bump , is larger than the stability , when starting even from the whole pattern .",
    "this could be useful in practical retrieval tasks with minimal information transmitted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section _ analytical analysis _ and using replica theory , we present our detailed mean - field analysis in the case of distance - dependent connectivities .",
    "we derive the equations for the corresponding order parameters ( op ) for finite and zero temperatures . in section _",
    "simulations _ we present the results of the simulations , done for the case of different topologies of the network , and we compare them with the analytical results . in section _ discussion _ we focus on the stability of the phase diagram of the network and especially on the dependence of the sas region on the parameters of the model .",
    "we discuss the behavior of the critical storage capacity when bump formations are present , as well as their effect on the information capacity of the network .",
    "the conclusion , drawn in the last part , shows that only the asymmetry between the learning and the retrieval states is sufficient to observe spatially asymmetric states .",
    "for the analytical analysis of the sas states , we consider the decomposition of the connectivity matrix @xmath22 by its eigenvectors @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the corresponding ( positive ) eigenvalues . for convenience",

    "the simulations also confirm this hypothesis .",
    "this avoids the introduction of infinite number of parameters , dependent on the state of the system , that would make impossible the analytical solution of the problem .    after taking the averages over the pattern , for the first term we get :    @xmath57",

    "the last result seems to be coherent with the picture of localized activity in a neural network with metric organization of the synaptic activities .",
    "in this paper we have studied the spatially dependent activity in a binary neural network model when retrieval and learning states have certain degree of asymmetry .",
    "we have shown that nor asymmetry of the connections , neither sparsity of the code are necessary to achieve bump solutions for the activity of the network , but rather different symmetry between the retrieval and the learning states .",
    "the extension of the classical method of amit et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of spatially dependent connectivity has permitted , within some approximations , the derivation of the above results analytically . the good correspondence with simulations , tested for different topologies of the network , is also discussed through the paper .",
    "we have shown that the region of the spatially asymmetric states is relatively large in the parameter space @xmath151 and we have measured quantitatively how the bumpiness of the network depends on these two parameters .    a drop of the critical storage capacity is observed in the transition form symmetric to sas states , which is due to the fact that effectively only the fraction of the network in the bump can be excited and the storage capacity drops proportionally to the size of the bump .",
    "when the recovering of the pattern starts from a state corresponding to the bump formation , the network behaves in a better way in terms of stability and capacity , compared to the case of uniform initial conditions .",
    "this happens even if the overlap with the uniform initial conditions is significantly larger .",
    "the latter result could argue the biological relevance of the bump formations for effective retrieval of information .",
    "finally we have discussed the behavior of the information capacity versus the asymmetry retrieval factor @xmath122 and we have discussed its sharp decrease in the parametric region , where bump formations are present .",
