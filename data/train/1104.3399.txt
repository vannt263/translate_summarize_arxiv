    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are studied by the detection of the extensive air showers ( eas ) that they produce in the atmosphere . at present , there are two main observation techniques .",
    "one , the so called fluorescence technique , employs telescopes to collect the fluorescence light emitted by atmospheric nitrogen molecules after being excited by the charged particles of the cascade .",
    "the other one , the surface technique , is based on the analysis of a discrete sampling of the shower front at the ground level , performed by surface detectors .",
    "uhecrs produce few observables .",
    "they are , basically , the arrival direction , the energy and some statistical hint about the identity of the primary particle .",
    "of these three pieces of information , the geometrical one is the most reliable for both detection techniques @xcite .",
    "the energy of the shower can be inferred with an accuracy of around 20% in the case of stereo fluorescence reconstruction @xcite . in the case of hybrid detectors ,",
    "this accuracy can be transferred to surface arrays using as calibrators events which are observed simultaneously by both techniques .",
    "the auger observatory was the pioneer of this strategy @xcite which is likely to become a standard for accuracy in the field @xcite .",
    "the need for such cross calibration already highlights the existence of as yet either unidentified problems with our understanding of the physics involved in shower generation and development or inconsistencies in our implementation of those physical processes into the available shower simulation codes .",
    "most of these problems certainly have their roots in the uncertainties associated with the extrapolation of cross sections , multiplicities and inelasticities from accelerator measurements at much lower energies , required to treat the first hadronic interactions experienced by the incoming cosmic ray in the upper layers of the atmosphere .",
    "given the indirect nature of the detection of cosmic rays at the highest energies , those uncertainties permeate , to a larger or lesser extent , all measurements done afterwords . in particular , they have their strongest manifestation on the interpretation and reliability of mass composition tracers , since variations in cross section or inelasticity can easily be misinterpreted as changes in baryonic composition ( see @xcite and @xcite for a thorough discussion on the relevance of hadronic interaction models to shower development ) .",
    "each observation technique has specific composition indicators .",
    "the fluorescence technique is , at present , the most reliable one for composition studies since the longitudinal development of the charged component of the atmospheric shower is a relatively straightforward observable .",
    "differences in composition , manifest themselves through differences in the cross section for interactions with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "these , in turn , are mapped as different average depths of maximum development of the electromagnetic component in the atmosphere ( @xmath0 ) for different nuclei and as different statistical dispersions for the @xmath0 distributions of different nuclei ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if , for example , proton and iron primaries are compared , the smaller cross section of the former will produce larger @xmath0 and @xmath1 than the latter @xcite",
    ". however , unforeseen changes in cross section as a function of energy can affect these parameters in much the same way as true changes in composition would @xcite .",
    "surface detectors , on the other hand , sample the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of the eas at discrete points while they traverse the ground level . beyond a few tens of meters from the shower axis , the particle content of the shower at ground level is dominated by just two components , electromagnetic ( i.e. , electrons , positrons and photons ) and muonic .",
    "these two sets of particles propagate differently through the atmosphere : the electromagnetic component propagates diffusively , while the muons do so radially from the last hadronic interaction region , which produces their parent mesons .",
    "therefore , in a simplified way , the shower front can be thought of as the composition of two fronts , a muonic one , which arrives first and is temporally thin and an electromagnetic disk , more extended in time that follows the muon front .",
    "furthermore , the muon shower front has a much better defined and larger curvature radius than the electromagnetic front .",
    "one of the practical effects of these differences is that information about the relative intensity of both components inside the shower and , therefore , of the identity of the primary nuclei , is encoded simultaneously in a non - trivial way in several properties of the shower front at ground level : the slope of the lateral distribution function of particles , the radius of curvature and its time structure .",
    "thus , several parameters have been proposed to extract composition information from the surface measurements of eas .",
    "the discrimination power of each parameter depends on the type of detector selected , water cherenkov tanks ( e.g. , haverah park , auger ) or scintillators ( e.g. , volcano ranch , agasa , telescope array ) . the former are sensitive to both the electromagnetic and muonic components ( although the number of muons is much smaller than the electromagnetic particles , they generate a large amount of cherenkov photons in the tanks ) while the latter are sensitive to the charged particles of the cascade which are dominated by electrons and positrons .",
    "scintillators are also shielded or buried underground to measured the muonic component of the showers .",
    "the most useful parameters so far have been the slope of the ldf @xcite , the curvature of the shower front , the number of muons in the shower @xcite , several indicators of the time structure of the shower like the rise time and other related parameters @xcite , and the azimuthal asymmetries in the signals @xcite .    in general terms ,",
    "fluorescence composition indicators are regarded as easier to observe and interpret , as well as less prone to systematic errors than surface parameters do .",
    "however , fluorescence detectors are constrained by a duty cycle of approximately 10% , while well operated , stable surface detectors can reach duty cycles near 100% .",
    "this factor alone , which makes the statistics per unit time of surface arrays an order of magnitude larger than that of fluorescence detectors , gives a great attractive to the search for reliable surface composition parameters .",
    "in the present work , we propose a new surface parameter which , we argue , for the same integration time can deliver better discrimination power than @xmath0 . the proposed parameter is defined as : @xmath2\\ ] ] where the sum extends over all the triggered stations _",
    "n _ , @xmath3 m is a reference distance , @xmath4 is the signal measured at the @xmath5th station and @xmath6 is the distance of this station to the shower axis in meters .",
    "@xmath7 is sensitive to the combined effects of the different muon and electromagnetic components on the lateral distribution function of proton and iron initiated showers .    as a case study",
    ", we analyze hereafter the behavior and main properties of @xmath7 by assuming general arrays of water cherenkov detectors .",
    "the results , however , should be still qualitatively valid for any other detector which produces comparable signals for the muonic and electromagnetic components of the showers . therefore , the signal and @xmath7 are measured in vem ( vertical equivalent muons , as in haverah park and auger experiments ) . in this case",
    ", we will demonstrate later that the primary identity discrimination power goes through a maximum around @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis has been performed considering different array geometries and varying the detectors separation , showing the general applicability of the parameter .",
    "@xmath7 could also be applied to scintillator arrays as the future telescope array experiment @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 shows an analytical discussion of the properties and stability of the new parameter .",
    "section 3 shows in some respects an equivalent numerical study performed with simulations taking into account the effects of reconstruction and experimental uncertainties . in section 4 we perform a realistic comparative study among the stability and reliability of the inferred composition by using @xmath9 , @xmath0 and the rise time at 1000 m from core .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 for a given event is constructed from the total signal in each triggered cherenkov detector . therefore , it depends on the normalization and shape of the lateral distribution function of the total signal .",
    "close to the impact point of the shower , the signal is dominated by the electromagnetic particles ( photons , electrons and positrons ) whereas at larger distances it is dominated by muons .",

    "a brief discussion follows on specific details about the determination of these two parameters :    * rise time at @xmath3 m from core , @xmath109 [ ns ] : the rise time of a single station is defined as the time it takes to increase from @xmath110 to @xmath111 of the total signal .",
    "the spread of the arrival times of the shower particles at a fixed core distance increases for smaller production heights , so the rise time is expected to be smaller for heavy primaries that develop higher in the atmosphere .",
    "@xmath109 is obtained by fitting the rise time of each triggered station using the function @xmath112 ns and evaluating the fitting function at @xmath3 m. parameters _ a _ and _ b _ are free in the fit .",
    "only stations whose distance to shower axis is in the range from 600 to 1500 m and whose signal is greater than 10 vem are included in this fit in order to avoid signals dominated by large fluctuations and saturated ones . since",
    "three stations are required at least in the fit , the number of events for which is possible to evaluate @xmath109 is significantly reduced , specially at larger zenith angles .",
    "* @xmath0 [ @xmath113 : up to now , @xmath0 is regarded as the most useful parameter for composition analysis .",
    "@xmath0 is very sensitive to the identity of the primary and less affected by uncertainties in energy determination compared to surface parameters , since it depends logarithmically on primary energy . in order to calculate a realistic @xmath0",
    ", we use the value calculated by aires and fluctuate it by using a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation is a typical value for the resolution achieved in fluorescence experiments @xcite , accounting for the response of the detector and the effects of the reconstruction method .    the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath0 are almost independent of zenith angle , so it is possible to combine events of different zenith angles in a given sample .",
    "obviously , this is not the situation for @xmath109 . to compensate this dependence a quadratic fit",
    "is performed @xmath109 vs. @xmath107 for each primary and hadronic model , and using average values of the fitted parameters , we correct , in a simple way , for the zenith angle dependence of @xmath109 : @xmath114 the correction does not increase the fluctuations and @xmath115 shows a strong reduction on the zenith angle dependence .",
    "for the subsequent analysis , we consider the lowest energy bin ( form @xmath86 to @xmath116 ev ) where we have the largest number of events .",
    "the samples corresponding to a given primary , him and one of the mass sensitive parameters considered are binned .",
    "let us call @xmath117 and @xmath118 to the number of events in the @xmath5th bin , normalized to the total number of events in the sample , corresponding to a given parameter and for protons and iron nuclei , respectively .",
    "the histograms @xmath119 and @xmath120 are assumed to be the distribution of the universe .",
    "the proton abundance or composition of a sample is defined as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the number of protons and iron nuclei in a given sample .",
    "we consider samples of @xmath124 from @xmath125 to @xmath126 in steps of @xmath94 .",
    "for each value of @xmath124 , we generate 500 samples of @xmath127 events each by taking at random values from the histograms @xmath119 and @xmath120 . for each of these new samples",
    "we generate a histogram @xmath128 , with the same binning used in @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which is not normalized and then satisfies @xmath129 .",
    "thus , assuming poisson statistics , the probability of having a configuration with @xmath130 events in the @xmath5th bin is given by , @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the unknown parameter .",
    "therefore , the inferred proton abundance is obtained by minimizing @xmath134 .",
    "[ fig : cp ] shows the inferred composition as a function of the true composition corresponding to qgsjet - ii . for sibyll 2.1",
    "similar results are obtained but with smaller error bars ( which represent the @xmath135 and @xmath136 c.l . ) , in agreement with the fact that the merit factors are in general greater for this him .",
    "the statistics available for each mass sensitive parameter corresponding to a given exposure time , is a key value to compare their discrimination capabilities . due to the limited duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes ,",
    "only 10% of the events are detected , so the statistics for @xmath0 is significantly lower than that for surface parameters ( ground detectors have almost full operation time ) .",
    "this fact has been considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] . just to illustrate the significance of taking into account the limited statistics for @xmath0 when",
    "doing composition studies , it is also shown the result for @xmath0 if the same statistics as the surface parameters were available .",
    "then , the error bars are reduced becoming the smallest ones , but ten times more exposure would be required .",
    "a second study has been performed .",
    "now , a fix true proton fraction @xmath137 is assumed and the inferred proton fraction is calculated in the energy range from @xmath80 to @xmath87 ev . in this case , in order to improve the small statistics in the higher energy bins , the histograms @xmath117 and @xmath118 corresponding to a given parameter , energy bin and him are fitted .",
    "the fitting function used is the so - called asymmetric generalized gaussian ( agg ) @xcite which is defined as , @xmath138 & if~ y < \\mu\\cr   % \\frac{c\\ , \\gamma_a}{\\gamma(1/c ) }   \\ \\exp[-\\gamma_r^c\\ ( y-\\mu)^c\\ , ] & if ~ y \\geq \\mu \\end{cases } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath139 @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the variances of the left and right sides of the probability density function , respectively , and @xmath142 is the gamma function .",
    "if @xmath143 , the agg is symmetric .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath143 and @xmath144 , agg reduces to the regular gaussian distribution function and , for @xmath145 , it represents the laplace distribution .",
    "[ fig : aggfits ] shows one example of these fits for each parameter considered .",
    "as can be seen , the agg function allows us to fit asymmetric distributions with longer tails and sharper ( or flatter ) maximums compared to a gaussian distribution . by using the distribution functions obtained in these fits",
    ", we could get the needed events to perform the calculation with enough statistics .",
    "samples of events corresponding to a given primary type , parameter , energy bin and him are generated by sampling the corresponding fitting function .",
    "the histograms @xmath119 and @xmath120 used as the universe have 1000 events each .",
    "the number of events of the test samples ( used to calculate the error of the inferred composition ) varies as a function of primary energy because of the steepness of the spectrum .",
    "the number of events expected by auger in 1 and 5 years of full operation are considered ev and around 30 at @xmath87 ev ] , and to reproduce real conditions , the number of events with available @xmath0 is @xmath110 of the total in the sample .",
    "the procedure to infer the composition is the same as explained before .    as in previous case",
    ", there is no significant bias in the inferred proton abundance .",
    "[ fig : deltacp_agg ] shows the uncertainty ( at @xmath135 of c.l . ) on the determination of the proton abundance as a function of primary energy for samples of @xmath146 .",
    "it can be seen that the best results are obtained for @xmath9 . as mentioned before , the errors corresponding to sibyll 2.1 are smaller than for qgsjet - ii because the shower to shower fluctuations are in general smaller for sibyll 2.1 .    as mentioned in section [ simulations ] ,",
    "the reconstructed energy considered in this work is obtained fluctuating the real one with a gaussian uncertainty .",
    "this procedure does not take into account the possible correlation between the reconstructed energy and primary composition , which has the potential to degrade the discrimination power of any mass composition parameter . in order to assess the magnitude of such effect , we consider the energy estimator @xmath147 as in the case of auger @xcite .    it is expected that , for the same energy , different primaries will produce showers with different @xmath148 parameter , giving rise to systematic effects on the reconstructed energy depending on the unknown composition of the impinging cosmic ray flux . in fact , from the simulations , we calculate the difference in @xmath147 between iron and proton showers with the same real energy and , as fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas38_vs_realenergy ] shows , @xmath149 increases almost linearly with the real primary energy .",
    "the relative value @xmath150 is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reldeltas38_vs_realenergy ] ( which is in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "this difference translates into a spurious difference , @xmath151 , between the estimated energy for proton and iron primaries of the same arrival energy .",
    "therefore , in order to assess the influence of the correlation between the reconstructed energy and composition on the stability of our @xmath9 parameter , we modify the reconstructed energy of each iron event by adding to its originally estimated energy the systematic error , @xmath151 , calculated from its own @xmath147 . on the other hand ,",
    "the procedure for the reconstruction of the energy of proton primaries is not modified .",
    "the energies thus obtained are used to repeat the process described above for composition discrimination in the case of surface parameters .",
    "[ fig : deltacp_sib_corr ] shows the results obtained for @xmath126 and @xmath152 years of integration time .",
    "the error in the measured composition using @xmath9 increases but still remains smaller , or of the order of those obtained using rise time or @xmath0 as discriminator parameters .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ fig : deltacp_sib_corr ] were calculated using sibyll 2.1 as hadronic interaction model , but are qualitatively similar for qgsjet - ii .     but considering the correlation between the reconstructed energy and the primary composition .",
    "see text for details.,width=377 ]",
    "a new family of parameters , that we call @xmath7 , has been proposed for composition analysis in cosmic ray surface arrays .",
    "the parameters are determined on a shower - to - shower basis from the total signal deposited in each triggered detector and their distance to the shower axis . despite the fact that surface composition parameters are usually more affected by systematic errors than the corresponding parameters obtained from the fluorescence technique ,",
    "the former are of great interest because of their larger duty cycle ( around 10 times larger ) .",
    "@xmath7 is of general applicability : its discrimination power has been studied for different surface arrays , varying the distance between detectors and the array geometry ( square and triangular grids ) . the separation power of @xmath7 increases rapidly as the array spacing decreases and remains strong for any array geometry .",
    "we have performed an extensive analytical study of the most relevant properties of @xmath7 .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a well defined value of the parameter @xmath51 which maximizes the discrimination capability of @xmath153 . in the case of a binary mixture or proton and iron ,",
    "that optimal value is @xmath154 .    furthermore , motivated by experimental results that suggest an excess of muon shower size with respect to numerical simulation expectations , we have analyzed the stability of @xmath51 under such conditions , showing that the optimal fit for @xmath51 is still @xmath155 and that ,",
    "furthermore , the discrimination power of @xmath156 , for an fe - p mixture , is actually enhanced .",
    "numerical simulations have also been carried out to account for experimental conditions and the uncertainties involved in the reconstruction procedure .",
    "the previous analytical results have also been validated from the simulations which include the detector response and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the numerical results support that @xmath157 is the value that maximizes the discrimination power of @xmath7 , in agreement with the analytical method , and independently of the array geometry or the distance between detectors .    additionally , we demonstrate that @xmath9 is almost independent on zenith angle , which represents an advantage over other mass sensitive parameters , and it is almost linearly dependent on the primary energy .    a realistic comparison between @xmath9 and the most useful parameters from the surface and fluorescence technique , i.e. , the rise time , @xmath158 , and @xmath0 respectively , has been performed .",
    "our simulations show that the accuracy on the determination of the composition obtained by using @xmath156 is , at constant integration time , greater than the one obtained using the other parameters considered .",
    "even if a realistic correlation between the reconstructed energy and the primary composition is included in the analysis , the discrimination power of @xmath156 , albeit degraded , still remains greater or of the order of the one obtained using the other parameters .",
    "the application of @xmath9 or any other composition parameter in a real experiment is not straightforward .",
    "the most significant problems that could affect @xmath9 have been considered in this work , such as the energy uncertainty , zenith angle dependence , surface array density and geometry , the effect of detectors very far from the core and the uncertainties in the hadronic interaction models ( specially in the muon component ) . on the other hand , @xmath0 is less prone to systematic errors but several circumstances must be considered to achieve reliable results .",
    "for instance , the longitudinal profile reconstruction suffers significant uncertainties coming from the fluorescence yield or possible direct cherenkov light towards the telescopes .",
    "atmospheric monitoring is also needed to account for the effect of clouds and aerosols . in hybrid experiments",
    "it requires an optimum synchronization with a surface detector as well .",
    "in addition , only those events whose @xmath0 is in the field of view of the telescopes could be properly reconstructed and this selection cut could introduce artificial biases that must be carefully corrected @xcite .",
