    "the sensitivities of all - sky monitoring vhe gamma - ray experiments are also expected to improve by the future projects such as the high altitude water cherenkov experiment ( hawc ) and the tibet - iii / md experiment .",

    "therefore , it would be possible to do a statistical study of vhe blazars in the cta / agis era , which would provide a crucial key to understand agn populations and high energy phenomena around super massive black holes in agns and jets .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the prospect of future blazar surveys by iacts , especially for the statistical power of future vhe blazar sample that can be obtained by realistic observing time of next - generation iacts . for this purpose , blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) and spectral energy distribution ( sed )",

    "we utilize this it09 model to predict the expected number and distributions of physical quantities of vhe blazars in future iact surveys .",

    "vhe observations provide a completely independent constraint on ebl , since vhe gamma - ray photons propagating the universe are absorbed via electron - positron pair creation with the ebl photons ( gould & schrder 1966 ; jelley 1966 ) . some useful limits have already been obtained by vhe blazar observations ( aharonian et  al . 2006a ; magic collaboration , albert , et  al .",

    "a catalog of objects obtained by such a survey is important for a statistical study , such as construction of luminosity function .",

    "typical total observable time for iacts are 1000 hrs in a year , and a more ambitious survey using @xmath39 1000 hrs may be required to construct a sufficiently large sample .",
    "another important implication is that the contamination of extragalactic objects will be small in the galactic plane survey by cta .",
    "it should be kept in mind that there is a considerable uncertainties in the numbers predicted above .",
    "the use of the blazar sed sequence is the key to convert the blazar luminosity function in the gev band into vhe band , but the validity of the blazar sequence is still a matter of debate .",
    "furthermore , vhe sed of our new sequence model is constrained by only 12 vhe blazars .",
    "we did not consider the time variability of blazars , because it is difficult to formulate the variability .",
    "the luminosity function model parameters have been determined only by about 50 egret blazars , but a much larger statistics by _ fermi _ will soon allow us a more accurate determination of the parameters of blazar sequence and glf . finally , our model includes only known blazar population .",

    "therefore , the redshift information may also be useful to select fermi blazars as the targets for cta observations , though using redshift information might introduce a further bias in the resulting sample .",
    "[ fig : survey ] shows the region in the fermi flux versus redshift plane for blazars than can be detected by cta for three different sensitivities .",
    "we denote @xmath42 ( depending on observed gamma - ray energy @xmath43 ) as the redshift at which the absorption optical depth becomes @xmath44 .",
    "it should be noted that , even for the same fermi flux , higher-@xmath45 blazars are more difficult to detect in vhe bands .",
    "this is not only by the effect of intergalactic absorption ; another effect is that vhe flux becomes relatively smaller compared with the fermi band at larger distances , because of the larger absolute luminosity and the assumed sed sequence .",
    "if the sed sequence is valid , one must be careful to discriminate between these two effects in the future analyses .    these two figures will be useful to design the follow - up strategy of _ fermi _ blazars by cta ( e.g. , the _ fermi _ flux and redshift thresholds for cta targets ) .",
    "the spectral index in the fermi band may also be useful for efficient target selection .",
    "a variety of target selection strategies are possible , and the best observing strategy must be determined according to the scientific purposes .",
    "now we consider to measure ebl by future vhe observations of blazars by cta , as a particular application of our result .",
    "an obvious approach is to use the brightest blazars and measure their vhe spectra precisely , to measure the intergalactic absorption feature and hence ebl .",
    "the improved cta sensitivity would allows us to measure the absorption features in a wider range of photon energy , and correspondingly , redshift . the optical depth to a source at a redshift @xmath45 is an integration of ebl from redshift zero to @xmath45 along the photon path , and the optical depth is mainly contributed by ebl photons whose frequency satisfies the relation @xmath46 .",
    "therefore ebl measurements by blazars having a variety of redshifts would give us information about evolution of ebl as well as spectrum .",
    "another possible approach to measure ebl is using a break in redshift distribution by intergalactic absorption .",
    "although this approach would require a larger sample than using a single vhe spectrum of bright blazars , the uncertainty concerning the intrinsic spectrum could be minimized by looking a statistical signature in redshift distribution . here",

    "we found that cta will detect a few vhe blazars by a blind survey using a total survey time of 100 hours .",

    "it will also be possible to construct a statistically large sample ( @xmath58 ) of blazars at @xmath59 0.100.36 to constrain ebl by the sharp break in the redshift distribution .",
    "this approach could avoid or minimize the uncertainty about intrinsic blazar spectra , and hence could be complementary to using a few spectra of brightest blazars .",
