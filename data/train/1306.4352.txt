    "the maxwell s demon paradox suggested that one can lower the entropy of a gas of particles without expending energy , and thus violate the second law of thermodynamics , if one has information about the positions and momenta of the particles @xcite . during the resolution of this puzzle it became however clear that thermodynamics imposes physical constraints on information processing @xcite .",
    "rolf landauer @xcite recognized that it is the logically irreversible erasure of information that necessitates a corresponding entropy increase in the environment @xcite ; i.e.  information erasure from the information - bearing degrees of freedom of a memory register or computer causes entropy to flow to the non - information - bearing degrees of freedom . at inverse temperature @xmath0 ,",
    "this entropy increase causes heat @xmath1 to be dissipated , where @xmath2 denotes the entropy decrease in the memory .",
    "this consequence is _",
    "landauer s principle _ , and the inequality ( [ landauersbasicinequality ] ) is also called the _ landauer bound _ or _",
    "limit_.    since its inception @xcite , the above argument has been controversially discussed on different levels . for example , it has been disputed whether it is necessary to assume the validity of the second law of thermodynamics in order to derive landauer s principle or whether , conversely , the second law itself is actually a consequence of the principle ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "situations have been reported  both theoretically @xcite and in experiment @xcite  which supposedly violate landauer s principle . and it was actually already recognized by bennett @xcite that all computation _ can _ be done reversibly , thereby avoiding irreversible erasure and requiring no heat dissipation in principle . on the other hand ,",
    "the principle was successful in exorcising maxwell s demon @xcite , and a recent experiment @xcite approached landauer s limit but could not surpass it .",
    "attempts to formulate and prove landauer s principle by more microscopic methods followed later ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but they still have deficiencies as we discuss more detail in section [ subsectpreworks ] .    much of the misunderstanding and controversy around landauer s principle appears to be due to the fact that its general statement has not been written down formally or proved in a rigorous way in the framework of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "to remedy this situation is the first goal of the present work .",
    "we formulate in precise mathematical and statistical mechanics terms the setup for landauer s principle .",
    "the four assumptions are listed at the beginning of section [ setupsubsection ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ figsetup ] for an overview of the setup ) .",
    "our formulation encompasses processes more general than `` erasure '' , and the setting is minimal in the sense that landauer s bound can be violated when any one of our assumptions is dropped . our first main result is a proof of landauer s principle in the form of a sharpened equality version ( theorem [ landauereqntheorem]):@xmath3where the mutual information @xmath4 quantifies the correlations built up between system and reservoir during the process and the relative entropy @xmath5 can be physically interpreted as the free energy increase in the reservoir .",
    "closer examination reveals that landauer s bound @xmath6 can be tight only if @xmath7 .",
    "the landauer bound ( [ landauersbasicinequality ] ) can thus be improved for all non - trivial processes .",
    "our second main result is then an explicit improvement of landauer s bound ( section [ finitesizesect ] ) , which will be possible when the thermal reservoir assisting in the process has a finite hilbert space dimension @xmath8 .",
    "a paradigmatic result is here ( see theorem [ maintheoremcombined]):@xmath9this is illustrated in fig .  [ relentropygraphs ] :  for small reservoirs , the necessary heat expenditure @xmath10 lies several ten percent above the landauer limit ( [ landauersbasicinequality ] ) .",
    "the main technical tool in deriving these finite - size effects is a tight entropy inequality between relative entropy and entropy difference @xcite .    in section [ extendednotionssection ] and appendix [ extendednotionssectionapp ]",
    ", we present a few extensions of the setup from section [ setupsubsection ] .",
    "section [ attainingsection ] forms a counterpart to results like eq .",

    "here we formalize the exact setting in which we prove  and improve ",
    "landauer s principle .",
    "we avoid unnecessary excess structure that is present in some previous works ( discussed in section [ subsectpreworks ] ) , and aim to motivate each necessary ingredient .",
    "this is the first step to a rigorous treatment of landauer s principle in sections [ lprinciplesharpened ] and [ finitesizesect ] . our setup and the subsequent statements will be quantum - mechanical , but apply to the classical ( probabilistic ) case as well upon restriction to commuting states and hamiltonians . in section [ extendednotionssection ] and appendix [ extendednotionssectionapp ]",
    "we discuss some extensions of the setup described here .",
    "as commonly conceived , landauer s process @xcite is supposed to `` erase '' or `` reset '' the state of a system by having it `` interact '' with a `` thermal reservoir '' , bringing the system into a `` definite '' state , such as a fixed pure state .",
    "we use this conception as a motivation , but our setup will be more general and precise .    the four assumptions needed for landauer s principle are as follows ( see also fig .  [ figsetup ] ) :    1 .",
    "the process involves a `` system '' @xmath12 and a `` reservoir '' @xmath13 , both described by hilbert spaces , 2 .",
    "the reservoir @xmath13 is initially in a thermal state , @xmath14}$ ] , where @xmath15 is a hermitian operator on @xmath13 ( `` hamiltonian '' ) and @xmath16 $ ] is the `` inverse temperature '' , 3 .",
    "the system @xmath12 and the reservoir @xmath13 are initially uncorrelated , @xmath17 , 4 .",
    "the process itself proceeds by unitary evolution , @xmath18 .",
    "we now discuss each of these four assumptions in more detail , arguing that this setup is minimal .",
    "the process acts on two subsystems , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and we call @xmath12 the `` system '' and @xmath13 the `` reservoir '' .",
    "we model these as quantum systems with hilbert spaces of finite dimensions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( see fig .  [ figsetup ] ) .",
    "the extension of our treatment to infinite - dimensional state spaces is discussed in appendix [ sectioninfinitedim ] .",
    "secondly , we require a hamiltonian @xmath21 of the reservoir to be given , i.e.  a hermitian operator @xmath22 .",
    "we furthermore assume that initially , i.e.  before the process starts , the reservoir is in a thermal state @xmath23}}\\ ] ] at inverse temperature @xmath16 $ ] ( for @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the maximally mixed state on the ground space of @xmath26 ; see appendix [ thermodynamicappendix ] for more details on statistical mechanics ) .",
    "the assumption of an initially thermal reservoir state to be consumed during the process is reasonable , since such states may be considered cheaply available ; this is due to the physics intuition  verified in several computable models  that a reservoir governed by @xmath15 and at inverse temperature @xmath0 will generically relax to the state ( [ definethermalstateinsetup ] ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or to a state close to it ( e.g.  @xcite ) . furthermore , if @xmath25 would not be a thermal state as in eq .",
    "( [ definethermalstateinsetup ] ) , then it would be possible to violate landauer s bound ( see section [ subsectpreworks ] ) ; this is related to the fact that thermal states are the only _ completely passive _ states , meaning that from an arbitrary number of state copies one can not extract work by unitary operations alone @xcite .",
    "lastly , the appearance of the initial thermal reservoir state ( [ definethermalstateinsetup ] ) is motivated already by the mathematical need to have a definite value for @xmath0 appearing in landauer s bound as stated in eq .",
    "( [ landauersbasicinequality ] ) .",
    "we do not put any assumption on the initial system state @xmath27 ; in particular , it need not be a thermal state .",
    "the following developments and results are in fact completely independent of the system hamiltonian , and it does not even need to be specified .    as the third assumption , we require system and reservoir to be initially uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath28 this assumption will be important for landauer s principle to hold : if the initial state @xmath29 would for instance be such that the reservoir @xmath13 had perfect classical correlations with @xmath12 , then a unitary process could reduce the system entropy without any heat dissipation , in violation of landauer s bound .",
    "this can be seen from the example in section [ memorysection ] , in which the system @xmath12 is brought into a final pure state without any change of the reduced state of the reservoir .",
    "the product state assumption ( [ productstateassumptioninsetup ] ) is standard in the theory of thermodynamics and in many common tasks in information processing , e.g.  in the paradigmatic examples of resetting a register in a computer or when performing error correction . in these cases ,",
    "the assisting reservoir @xmath13 is often assumed not to have previously interacted with the register @xmath12 , such that their states are independent . when however system and reservoir have undergone prior interactions ,",
    "they may be correlated , and we give a landauer - like bound for this case in eq .",

    "( [ definethermalstateinsetup ] ) ) , correlations in @xmath30 would be unnatural unless the full initial state @xmath29 were also thermal , but this would then require a ( hamiltonian ) interaction term between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; see also @xcite .",
    "some reported `` violations '' of landauer s bound @xcite can be explained by their not respecting the initial product state assumption ( [ productstateassumptioninsetup ] ) .",

    "the fourth and last assumption is that the process itself happens by any unitary evolution @xmath34 where the unitary @xmath35 acts jointly on @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "importantly , the unitarity assumption implies that no unspecified environment @xmath36 may participate in the process and take on entropy , which is what may happen during a dissipative process described by quantum channels . instead",
    ", the description ( [ unitaryevolsetupsect ] ) forces one to explicitly include all resources used during the process in the description by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , if a general quantum channel were allowed for the evolution @xmath37 , then there obviously could not be any restriction on the entropy changes and heat flows ( defined below ) and no version of landauer s bound could hold .",
    "the unitary @xmath38 in ( [ unitaryevolsetupsect ] ) may for example be effected by a time - dependent schrdinger evolution , where an interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 is switched on at some point in time by an external agent and then switched off later , such that a total unitary @xmath38 acts on the initial state @xmath29 and gives the final state ( [ unitaryevolsetupsect ] ) .",
    "our setup and results below do however not require any such structure for @xmath38 ; in fact , they do not even depend on the concrete unitary @xmath38 , but merely on the fact that the evolution @xmath37 was effected by _ some _ unitary .    the joint final state @xmath40 of system and reservoir may be correlated , which is the generic case . by @xmath41",
    "$ ] we denote the final state of the system ( `` state after the process '' ) , by @xmath42 $ ] the final state of the reservoir .",
    "note in particular that we do not require @xmath43 to be a pure state .",
    "this assumption is frequently made in the literature , but may not always be achieved as discussed in section [ boundonpureness ] .    for a process as just described , _",
    "landauer s principle _ relates the _ entropy decrease of the system _ @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 denotes the von neumann entropy , eq .",

    "the term `` heat '' is justified because this energy is not `` ordered '' since @xmath13 is an initially thermal reservoir , which may absorb entropy from @xmath12 during the process and spread the energy over many states @xcite .",

    "but unless explicitly stated otherwise , our derivations also apply to the case where the entropy of @xmath12 increases , corresponding to @xmath48 , and we subsume this by the term `` process '' as well . similarly ,",

    "<S> most theoretical justifications of landauer s principle either use thermodynamic reasoning or rely on specific models based on arguable assumptions . here , we aim at a general and minimal setup to formulate landauer s principle in precise terms . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple and rigorous proof of an improved version of the principle , which is formulated in terms of an equality rather than an inequality . the proof is based on quantum statistical mechanics concepts rather than on thermodynamic argumentation . from this equality version , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain explicit improvements of landauer s bound that depend on the effective size of the thermal reservoir and reduce to landauer s bound only for infinite - sized reservoirs . </S>"
