    "the use of quantum master equations ( me ) for weakly coupled systems is well - spread , notably in various resonance spectroscopies and in experimental realization of ensemble quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the traditional system plus bath models seek to derive an me to describe the non - unitary behavior of the system by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom @xcite . though the mes typically involve a second - order perturbative expansion of the system - bath coupling , the application of any external drive on the system is usually treated in the linear response regime @xcite .",
    "a parallel approach assumes that the coupling and the drive induce independent rates of variation in the system resulting in a unitary evolution due to the drive @xcite .",
    "therefore the system - bath coupling remains the only source of damping and hence non - unitary behavior in such systems . on the contrary , the semi - classical theory of bloembergen , purcell and pound hints at the existence of nonlinear response terms in the mes which lead to additional damping of the population differences @xcite .",
    "other semi - classical models used to explain the phenomenon of saturation also indicate the presence of higher order terms of the drive @xcite .",
    "but the existing prescriptions to derive mes are not well - suited to obtain time - nonlocal higher - order contributions of the drive .    here",
    "we attempt to resolve this conflict by considering the finite memory effects of the bath originating from the equilibrium fluctuations of its energy levels .",
    "the bath - memory renders the higher order perturbations of the drive to be time - nonlocal and therefore opens up the possibility of a perturbative expansion up to any desired order .",
    "restricting ourselves upto second - order , we subsequently derive a modified form of the bloch equations having drive - induced damping terms and also provide a direct experimental verification of its validity .",
    "to begin with , we consider an ensemble , each member of which is described by the following hamiltonian in the angular frequency unit ( t ) = _ ^s +",
    "_ ^l + ^sl + ^s(t ) + ^l(t ) , where , @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the static hamiltonians of the relevant and the non - relevant degrees of freedom respectively , which are weakly coupled by the term @xmath2 . the collection of the relevant degrees of freedom constitute our system of interest whereas the non - relevant degrees of freedom together form a heat bath .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the external drive to the system .",
    "it is assumed that the bath is in thermal equilibrium at an inverse temperature @xmath4 and experiences equilibrium fluctuations @xmath5 , which solely act on the bath .",
    "@xmath5 may assume different values for different ensemble members while respecting the constraints imposed by the requirement of sustained thermal equilibrium .",
    "apart from @xmath5 , the other terms in the hamiltonian are identical for all ensemble members and as such @xmath1 determines the equilibrium density matrix of the bath .",
    "since the fluctuations do not drive the bath away from equilibrium , we choose @xmath5 to be diagonal in the eigen - basis @xmath6 of @xmath1 , represented by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8-s are assumed to be independent , gaussian , @xmath9-correlated stochastic variables with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath10 .",
    "we further assume that the fluctuation @xmath5 and the state experiencing it at the time instant @xmath11 are statistically independent so as to preserve causality .    starting with this description , we perform all subsequent calculations in the interaction representation of @xmath12 and all hamiltonians in this representation are denoted by @xmath13 with relevant superscripts .",
