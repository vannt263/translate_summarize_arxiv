    "are extracted from this simulation , and the optical depth of ly-@xmath0  absorption is calculated based on the neutral hydrogen density along the line of sight .",
    "the spectra are smoothed with a 1-d gaussian of dispersion @xmath49 @xmath5 , equivalent to boss spectral resolution at @xmath50 .",
    "dm skewers that correspond to the spectra are also extracted from this simulation , and the dm is smoothed three - dimensionally with several smoothing scales @xmath51 . the optical depth along each spectrum is converted to ly-@xmath0  forest flux by @xmath52 , and pdfs for the values of the flux conditional on dm overdensity can thus be determined .",
    "lymas operates on the assumption that the flux in one pixel is not correlated with the flux in a separate pixel _ except _ through correlations in the underlying dark matter .",
    "the flux in pixel 1 is drawn from the conditional distribution @xmath53 without reference to the value @xmath54 drawn from @xmath55 in pixel 2 , but @xmath56 and @xmath54 are correlated because of the correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this _ ansatz _ , that the relation between flux and matter density is `` locally stochastic , '' can be expressed by the equation @xmath59 along each individual line of sight , coherence among neighboring pixels is imposed by generating a  percentile field \" that governs draws from @xmath18 , rather than drawing each pixel value independently .",
    "the correct 1-d flux power spectrum is imposed , on average , by multiplying line - of - sight fourier modes by numerically calibrated correction factors . except for the change in the calibrating simulations themselves , our procedures here are the same as those presented by p14 .",
    "we apply lymas to dm simulations with side lengths 300 @xmath5  and 1 @xmath6 , the same sizes studied in p14 , but with cosmological parameters matched to those of the hydro simulations .",

    "while the gas density field ( green ) is similar in both simulations , regions of high temperature ( red ) and high metallicity ( blue ) are more extended in the agn feedback run .",
    "agn feedback has a considerable impact on the mass function and morphologies of the simulated galaxy population @xcite , but the impact on conditional flux pdfs is small , and ( as we show below ) the impact on halo - flux correlations is negligible . when extracting ly-@xmath0  forest spectra from the simulated gas distribution , the uv background intensity is chosen to give a mean transmitted ly-@xmath0  forest flux @xmath61 , matching the metal - corrected @xmath1 value measured from high - resolution spectra by @xcite .",

    "we fit a model to the numerical cross - correlation results and analyze its dependence on halo mass .",

    "reproduces the cross - correlations @xmath27  predicted using the full hydrodynamic ly-@xmath0  forest spectra almost exactly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lymas_vs_hydro ] ) .",
    "the lymas predictions are insensitive to the dark matter mass resolution or smoothing scale over the range investigated here ( fig .",

    "furthermore , the predicted @xmath27  is almost completely insensitive to agn feedback as implemented in horizon - agn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agn ] ) , implying that this measure of cosmological structure is insensitive to feedback assumptions even at scales @xmath77 @xmath5 .",
    "we have applied lymas to a @xmath4-particle @xmath20-body simulation of a 1 @xmath6   box , with the same wmap7 cosmological parameters used for the horizon simulations , to predict @xmath27  for halo masses in the range @xmath80  @xmath237 at @xmath1 . our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1000_fitted ] ) can be described by the empirically chosen lorentzian form of equation ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) , which can be used along with equations ( [ eq : depth ] ) and ( [ eq : fwhm ] ) and the parameters in tables  [ tab : mass_params ] and  [ tab : delta ] to reproduce our results for any of the fr12/fr13 @xmath29 bins and any halo mass in this range .",
    "the difference between the lorentzian fit and the numerical results is significant at the level of our simulation s tiny statistical errors , but it is small compared to current observational errors . except for the @xmath77 @xmath5  bin ,",
    "the trend of cross - correlation amplitude with halo mass follows the standard large scale @xmath238 relation from t10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : depvsmass ] ) . furthermore , even on small scales , @xmath27  for a halo population with a range of masses depends only on the number - weighted halo bias ( eq .",
    "[ eq : bias_eff ] ) . modeling quasar or dla observations down to these scales",
    "therefore improves constraints on the characteristic halo mass but does not provide information about the width or shape of the halo mass distribution .",
    "we have compared the lymas results to linear theory predictions using bias parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the ly-@xmath0  forest determined by fitting the lymas flux auto - correlation , and t10 values for the halo bias .",
    "we find surprisingly good agreement in @xmath27  even at @xmath77 @xmath5 , with maximum deviations of @xmath239 near @xmath97 @xmath5  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_theory ] ) .",
    "however , in a monopole - quadrupole representation , linear theory and lymas differ significantly in the quadrupole at @xmath40 @xmath5 , while agreement for the monopole is good down to @xmath240 @xmath5  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_monoquad ] ) . in a @xmath128 representation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_r5 ] ) , deviations are @xmath120-dependent , and they are larger for higher halo masses .    when comparing to the boss measurements of fr12 and fr13 , we find that any choice of halo mass that fits @xmath27  at @xmath241 @xmath5  overpredicts the amplitude of the cross - correlation at smaller scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fitted_fr ] ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is scatter between halo velocities and measured redshifts in boss , which can arise from a combination of redshift measurement errors and random peculiar velocities of quasars or dlas within their host halos ; the velocities of the halos themselves are already accounted for in the lymas predictions .",
    "we fit the quasar ( fr13 ) and dla ( fr12 ) measurements with a model that convolves the lymas predictions with a gaussian distribution of redshift offsets of rms amplitude @xmath242 , which removes the tension between large - scale and small - scale predictions . for quasars ,",
    "we also incorporate the @xmath196 km s@xmath22 mean redshift offset inferred by fr13 from the asymmetry of @xmath27 .    for quasars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qso_zerr ] ) we find @xmath243 km s@xmath22 , a magnitude that is compatible with other estimates of quasar redshift errors from boss spectra @xcite .",
    "our best - fit halo mass is @xmath80  @xmath203 , which corresponds to a halo bias @xmath244 at @xmath1 for our wmap7 cosmology ( using the t10 halo bias relation ) . for dlas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dla_zerr ] ) we find @xmath245 km s@xmath22 , a value that appears high for pure measurement errors but may reflect a quadrature sum of measurement errors and halo internal velocities .",
    "our best - fit halo mass is @xmath80  @xmath246 , with corresponding @xmath247 at @xmath1 .",
    "relative to linear theory modeling , the lymas results have the advantage of fitting a fully non - linear model to the full range of measurements , and ( as a necessary consequence ) fitting for redshift scatter as well as effective halo mass .",
    "however , there are several caveats to our numbers .",
    "first , the slight mismatch between our simulation s @xmath1 redshift output and the @xmath35 central redshift of the boss measurements introduces ambiguity ; our best - fit halo masses correspond to bias factors that are about 10% lower at @xmath35 than at @xmath1 ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) , and it is not clear which is the more appropriate characterization of our inferred halo bias .",
    "second , the flux auto - correlation from the 1 @xmath6  lymas box is significantly below that from the linear theory fit of @xcite to the boss auto - correlation measurements at @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : auto ] ) , and our best - fit values of @xmath124 and @xmath248 do not agree with the values extrapolated from smaller volume hydro simulations by @xcite .",
    "this difference could reflect a combination of incorrect thermal structure of the diffuse igm in our calibrating hydro simulations ( e.g. , if the real universe has a different history of helium reionization ) , inaccurate prediction of the large scale flux auto - correlation by lymas , uncertainties on scaling results between @xmath35 and @xmath1 , and errors in the @xcite measurements , which themselves require substantial corrections for the impact of continuum determination in the observed spectra .",
    "finally , for quasars , our fit has a statistically unacceptable @xmath137/d.o.f .",
    "the largest contribution to @xmath137 comes from our innermost @xmath250-bin , where predictions are most sensitive to our assumption of gaussian velocity errors . if we eliminate this bin from our mass fit ( but retain the best - fit @xmath251 ) we find @xmath80  @xmath252 , with corresponding @xmath253 at @xmath1 .",
    "we regard this as our most reliable estimate of halo mass and halo bias for boss quasars because of its lower sensitivity to our @xmath251 model . the @xmath137/d.o.f .",
    "improves to 197/142 , but it is still high , reflecting a tension between lower masses favored by the @xmath254 @xmath5  data and the higher masses favored by @xmath255 @xmath5  data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qso_chisq ] ) .",
    "if instead we eliminate all data points with @xmath40 @xmath5  but retain our best - fit @xmath256 km s@xmath22 , we obtain a best - fit halo mass of @xmath80  @xmath257 , corresponding to @xmath258 at @xmath1 . the @xmath137/d.o.f . for this fit",
    "remains high at 221/132 . for dlas ,",
    "the measurement errors are larger , and our fit ( with @xmath80   @xmath246 and @xmath231 ) has an acceptable @xmath137/d.o.f . @xmath259 .",
    "our dla halo bias is consistent with that inferred by fr12 using linear theory modeling at separations @xmath260",
    "@xmath5 . our quasar halo bias is lower than that inferred by fr13 ; an exact comparison is complicated by the slight difference in model redshift , but the best - fit fr13 parameters correspond to a predicted cross - correlation that is stronger by @xmath261 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qso_zerr ] ) .",
    "the main source of difference appears to be the selection of fitting range , as fr13 s elimination of @xmath40 @xmath5  separations removes the points that are favoring lower bias in our fit .",
    "the surprisingly good agreement between lymas and linear theory predictions of @xmath27  suggests that smaller separations can be retained even in a linear theory fit , provided one accounts for quasar redshift errors .",
    "analyses of the final boss data set will allow cross - correlation measurements in bins of redshift and tracer properties ( quasar luminosity , dla metallicity ) while retaining useful statistical precision on large scales .",
    "comparison of observations , linear theory fits , and lymas modeling across these bins will allow tests for internal consistency ( e.g. , expected redshift scaling ) and investigations of the relation between tracer properties and halo mass .",
    "the importance of @xmath251 in our fits highlights a new opportunity to constrain the velocity distribution of quasars or dlas within their host halos . for quasars",
    ", one can imagine measuring the mean offset and dispersion of redshifts inferred from different emission lines as a diagnostic of gas motions and ionization states in the immediate surroundings of the central black hole .",
    "ionizing radiation from quasars should also affect cross - correlations on small scales ( the  transverse proximity effect \" ) , and it may be possible to separate this impact from redshift dispersion effects via the expected dependence on quasar luminosity . for dlas the comparison of rms velocities to halo circular velocities may be a useful diagnostic for the kinematics of the metal - line absorption , perhaps distinguishing rotating disks from more chaotic gas distributions .",
    "the first studies of ly-@xmath0  forest cross - correlations have already yielded the most precise measurements of quasar and dla clustering strength , and this tool holds considerable promise as a probe of the physics of high - redshift systems .",
