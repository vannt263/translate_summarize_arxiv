    "the electric dipole moment @xmath0 of the neutron provides a unique and sensitive probe to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it has played an important part over many decades in shaping and constraining numerous models of cp violation .",
    "while the cp violation observed in @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson decays can be accounted for by the phase of the ckm matrix , the baryon asymmetry of the universe can not be described by this phase alone , suggesting that there are additional sources of @xmath7 violation awaiting discovery .",
    "qcd allows for cp - violating effects that propagate into the hadronic sector via the so - called @xmath2 term @xmath8 in the action , @xmath9 where ( in lattice notation ) @xmath10 is the topological charge , and @xmath11 is the standard cp - preserving qcd action .",
    "thus , there is the possibility of strong @xmath7 violation arising from a nonvanishing vacuum angle @xmath2 . in a wide class of guts",
    "the diagrams that generate a high baryon to photon asymmetry contribute to the renormalization of @xmath2 , and hence to the electric dipole moment of the neutron . with the increasingly precise experimental efforts to observe the electric dipole moment  @xcite , it is important to have a rigorous calculation directly from qcd .",
    "it is practically impossible to perform monte carlo simulations with the action ( [ stheta ] ) in four dimensions for any sensible definition of the topological charge and any angle @xmath12 . absorbing the @xmath2 term into the observable  @xcite is not a viable alternative , as @xmath13 is found not to vanish if one of the quark masses is taken to zero at present values of the coupling . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the topological susceptibility @xmath14 on @xmath15 lattices taken from @xcite at spacing @xmath16 .",
    "the charge @xmath17 has been computed from the wilson flow  @xcite at flow time @xmath18 .",
    "similar results have been reported in  @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 will not vanish in the limit of zero quark mass either , except perhaps for chiral fermions .",
    "exactly that was found in  @xcite .",
    "this precludes a meaningful extrapolation of @xmath0 to the physical point .",
    "there are indications that the situation will improve for lattice spacings @xmath19 only  @xcite .",
    "it so happens that the @xmath2 term can be chirally rotated into the fermionic part of the action , making use of the axial anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of that is @xmath20 for three quark flavors with nondegenerate masses .",
    "this action lends itself to numerical simulations for imaginary values of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "as we are mainly interested in small values of @xmath2 , the results can be analytically continued to real numbers without difficulties , assuming that the theory is analytic in the vicinity of @xmath21 .",
    "in this paper we present an entirely dynamical calculation of the electric dipole moment of the neutron on the lattice .",
    "this is a challenging task .",
    "as @xmath0 quickly diminishes towards physical quark masses , the angle @xmath2 has to be chosen increasingly larger to compensate for that .",
    "this in turn leads to a substantial increase of zero modes , which slows down the simulations substantially and eventually will result in exceptional configurations  @xcite .",
    "we follow  @xcite and start from the su(3 ) flavor symmetric point @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "our strategy has been to keep the singlet quark mass @xmath24 fixed at its physical value , while @xmath25 is varied .",
    "as we move from the symmetric point to the physical point along the path @xmath26 , the @xmath27 quark becomes heavier , while the @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks become lighter .",
    "these two effects tend to cancel in any flavor singlet quantity , such as the topological susceptibility @xmath14 .",
    "the cancellation is perfect at the symmetric point  @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks to be mass degenerate , writing @xmath30 .",
    "the vacuum angle is taken purely imaginary , @xmath31 this leads us to consider the action @xmath32 which is real and vanishes at @xmath33 as well as @xmath34 .",
    "our fermion action has single level stout smearing for the hopping terms together with unsmeared links for the clover term . with the ( tree level )",
    "symanzik improved gluon action this constitutes the stout link non - perturbative clover or slinc action  @xcite . to cancel o(a ) terms the clover coefficient",
    "@xmath35 has been computed nonperturbatively . for each flavor",
    "the fermion action to be simulated reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wilson dirac operator and @xmath38 the extra term in the action ( [ saction ] ) can be treated in a similar way as we treat disconnected diagrams in calculations of singlet hadron matrix elements and renormalization factors  @xcite .",
