    "since their discovery ( about 70 years ago ) the giant resonances have been considered as the best example of coherent motion of nuclear systems@xcite . from a macroscopic point of view , this collective behavior can be considered as high frequency , harmonic vibrations of the nuclear density around its equilibrium shape .",
    "if these oscillations were harmonic then higher states of equidistant energies should exist .",
    "the first experimental indication of some structures in the excitation function in heavy ion collisions which could be interpreted as due to the population of double giant resonances dates back to 1977 ( see reviews in ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently there has been an unambiguous evidence of the existence of a double giant quadrupole resonance@xcite .",
    "more recently also the triple giant quadrupole resonance has been observed at ganil by using , for the first time , the speg spectrometer in conjunction with the indra 4@xmath0 detector@xcite .",
    "multiphonon excitations were clearly observed in double charge exchange reactions using ( @xmath1 ) and ( @xmath2 ) reactions@xcite .",
    "the study of the excitation of the double gdr of very heavy nuclei by means of relativistic coulomb excitation have been investigated in experiments performed at gsi within the land collaboration@xcite .",
    "these are exclusive experiments where projectile fragments , neutron and gamma rays from the excited fragments are measured .",
    "more recently , the same group has found a hint for a three - phonon dipole state by measuring differential cross section for electromagnetic fission of @xmath3u at relativistic energy@xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies to have a better comprehension of the multiphonon problematic have taken various directions .",
    "an extension of the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( rpa ) has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in addition to the mixing of one- and two - phonon states , also some specific three - phonon configurations have been considered as a mechanism to generate the damping width of the dgdr .",
    "other approaches exploit the so called brink - axel hypothesis@xcite : a giant resonance can be excited on top of any nuclear excited state . in this approach@xcite ,",
    "the states to which the one - phonon states decay are described in terms of goe ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) . by means of the random matrix theory",
    "the average cross section for the excitation of the double gdr is calculated as a function of the spreading and damping width .",
    "the inelastic cross sections of the double and triple giant dipole resonances in a coulomb excitation process@xcite have been also calculated .",
    "the excitation of collective vibrational states in heavy ion collisions can be viewed as due to the action of the mean field of each collision partner on the other . a rather good microscopic description of such states is given by random phase approximation .",
    "it can be introduced as the lowest order in a boson expansion leading to a boson image of the hamiltonian which is a sum of independent harmonic oscillators corresponding to each collective mode .",
    "thus the rpa states are pure one - phonon and multiphonon states and their energy is the sum of the energies of the single phonons . when further terms in the boson expansion are taken into account , anharmonicities arise and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are superpositions of multiphonon states , also with different numbers of phonons .    the mean field @xmath4 of each nucleus is a one body operator .",
    "when the ground state of each nucleus is approximated by the uncorrelated hartree - fock ( hf ) one , only the particle - hole ( ph ) part of @xmath4 enters .",
    "its bosonic image is linear in the phonon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "non linear terms arise in a natural way when the correlations in the ground state are taken into account and thus the particle - particle and hole - hole parts of @xmath4 are no more negligible .",
    "indeed , the bosonic images of such terms are non - linear in the rpa phonons .    in several previous papers@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the above mentioned anharmonicities and non - linearities bring to a much better agreement between theoretical and experimental cross sections for the excitation of double giant resonance states in heavy ion collisions .",
    "till now only the cross sections to one- and two - phonon states have been calculated within the above recalled approach .",
    "( for simplicity , we will call `` n - phonon state '' an eigenstate of the hamiltonian whose main component is a n - phonon configuration ) . in ref.@xcite , however , we have computed the vibrational spectrum of @xmath5ca and @xmath6pb by extending the previous calculations with the inclusion of three - phonon states .",
    "it was found that the two - phonon states are affected by this extension . in particular , the double giant resonances ( gr ) are appreciably pushed down .",
    "the lesson we learn from this is that one can not perform calculations on the double gr without taking into account the effect of the three - phonon states . in view of that , in the present paper we recalculate the cross section for the inelastic scattering @xmath5ca + @xmath5ca at 50 mev / a and @xmath6pb + @xmath6pb at 641 mev / a in the enlarged space in order to check how much our previous results on the cross section in the double gr region are modified .",
    "then we will present calculations of the inelastic cross sections for the triple excitation of the gr where we include the three - phonon states . in these latter calculations",
    "we will also take into account the effects of the four - phonon states .",
    "in this section we shortly recall our approach and how anharmonicities in the spectrum and non - linearities in the excitation operator are treated in it .",
    "our model makes use of standard semiclassical methods techniques .",
    "these methods are based on the assumption that nuclei move on classical trajectories , while the internal degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "let us denote by p ( h ) the single particle states which are unoccupied ( occupied ) in the hf ground state of the nucleus and introduce the mappings@xcite @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are bosonic operators @xmath11=\\delta_{pp ' } \\delta_{hh ' } \\>.\\ ] ] the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) is a correction taking care of the pauli principle .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian is then mapped onto @xmath12 where we have dropped indices for simplicity .",
    "the term @xmath13 vanishes in the hf basis .",
    "collective phonon operators are introduced by means of the bogoliubov transformation @xmath14 the @xmath15 and @xmath16 coefficients can be chosen so that the part of the hamiltonian which is quadratic in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 operators is diagonal when expressed in terms of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ones @xmath21 and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy the rpa equations .",
    "of course , the spectrum of @xmath22 is harmonic .",
    "the other terms of the bosonic hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) introduce anharmonicities since they mix multiphonon states among themselves . in our model",
    "we neglect the @xmath23 term because it is smaller than the others , as it has also been checked in an extended lipkin model@xcite . for the remaining terms we keep only @xmath24 because the others are smaller by a factor @xmath25 or powers of it .",
    "therefore our bosonic hamiltonian becomes @xmath26 the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath27 are then found by diagonalizing it in the space of the states containing up to a certain number @xmath28 of phonons .",
    "the @xmath29 term mixes multiphonon states with the same number of phonons , while the @xmath30 mixes states having number of phonons differing by one . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown the results for @xmath5ca and @xmath6pb obtained in the space with @xmath31=3 and we have compared them with those of ref.@xcite where we had @xmath31=2 . in the next section",
    "we will mention the main results obtained there .      within a semiclassical approach to nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "the excitation of one partner ( say a ) is due to the mean field of the other ( b ) acting on it .",
    "therefore the excitation operator is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the mean field of @xmath18 ( including coulomb ) which depends on time through the relative distance between the two nuclei .",
    "the indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote single particle states , both occupied and unoccupied , in nucleus a. when one neglects the correlation present in the ground state , only the @xmath37 terms of @xmath38 are effective and the boson image of @xmath38 is linear in the @xmath39 and @xmath20 operators . taking into account the correlations",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 parts of @xmath38 can not be neglected and this brings to quadratic terms @xmath42 the first term in this equation represents the interaction of the two colliding nuclei in their ground state .",
    "the @xmath43 part connects states differing by one phonon , the @xmath44 term couples excited states with the same number of phonons , while @xmath45 allows coupling between states differing by two phonons .",
    "these new routes of excitation may increase the excitation probability of the multiple gr .",
    "the inelastic scattering cross section is calculated within a semiclassical coupled channel approach .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the excited state of the nucleus of which we want to calculate the excitation probability .",
    "these states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) and therefore are superpositions of multiphonon states obtained by diagonalizing @xmath27 in the space containing up to @xmath31 phonon configurations .",
    "the excitation probability amplitudes satisfy , for each impact parameter @xmath47 , the set of coupled differential equations @xmath48 which are integrated along classical trajectories with various impact parameters @xmath47@xcite .",
    "the cross section to excite the state @xmath46 is then calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the integral is over the whole impact parameters range which is modulated by the transmission coefficient @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the results we have obtained for the structure calculation for the @xmath5ca@xcite .",
    "as stated also in the introduction , in that calculations we were guided by the results we got from a study of an extended lipkin - meshow - glick ( lmg ) model@xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the original lmg model has been extended in order to include terms that play the same role than the anharmonic terms of our hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of such extended lmg model is still exactly solvable .",
    "the relevant results can be summarized as follows : its diagonalization in an enlarged space including up to three - phonon states produces results which are very close to the exact ones@xcite .",
    "therefore we have followed this approach to calculate the spectrum of @xmath5ca in the space of one- , two- and three - phonon states .",
    "we have used a discrete selfconsistent hf+rpa with a sgii interaction , including all one - phonon states with j@xmath523 which exhaust at least 5% of the ewsr . for the nucleus @xmath5ca",
    ", we have used the nine one - phonon basis shown in table  [ basis - ca ] .",
    "we have constructed all two- and three - phonon configurations out of them , without energy cut - off , with both natural and unnatural parity .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) has been diagonalized in the space spanned by such states .",
    "the eigenstates are mixed states whose components are of one- , two- and three - phonon kind @xmath53 rpa one - phonon basis for the nucleus @xmath5ca . for each state , spin ,",
    "parity , energy and percentage of the ewsr(isovector for the gdr and the ivgqr and isoscalar for all the other states ) are reported . in the last two columns we report the energies of the phonons after the inclusion of two and three - phonon states , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     from table [ sigma - pb ] one can see that the integrated cross - section for the excitation of the gdr is large at such a relativistic energy , reaching 3.5 barns .",
    "then a factor 10 has to be paid each time a new phonon is excited still leaving some sizeable cross - section for two and three phonon excitations . in the second row",
    "we show the results for the calculations done with only one- and two - phonon states . in the three - phonon region",
    "we gain a factor 10 when we introduce in the calculation the three - phonon states .    to get a deeper insight in the excitation process , it is interesting to decompose the computed inelastic spectrum in various multipolarities .",
    "let us first start with the dipole strength which strongly dominates at relativistic energies ( see figure [ fig : pb-3pho - vs - l ] ) .",
    "the gdr , which is splitted into a main component at 12.5 mev and a smaller peak around 17 mev , is of course the main contributor but one can observe above 35 mev a small contribution of the three - gdr state coupled to spin and parity @xmath54 .",
    "the quadrupole strength is more complex .",
    "starting at low energy one observes the low lying collective @xmath55 state followed by the isoscalar gqr just above 10 mev . except for the small shoulder at 22 mev coming from the isovector gqr",
    ", the strong bump at 25 mev can be essentially attributed to the double gdr coupled to @xmath55 .",
    "this peak can be directly compared with the monopole strength which corresponds entirely to the double gdr coupled to @xmath56 .",
    "coming back to the quadrupole response one notices that the two phonon contribution appears as strong as the one phonon excitation .",
    "a multipole analysis can thus be an interesting way to experimentally isolate the multiphonon contribution .",
    "finally , the octupole response presents both a @xmath57 and heor components around 3 and 24 mev , followed by the triple gdr state coupled to @xmath57 around 35 mev .",
    "this three phonon component corresponds to the structures observed in the @xmath54 response which is nothing but the low spin member of the three - phonon multiplet .",
    "decomposition of the inelastic cross - section for @xmath58+@xmath58 at 641 mev / a ( solid line ) into different angular momenta , l=0 ( long - dashed ) , l=1 ( short - dashed ) , l=2 ( dot - dashed ) and l=3 ( dotted ) . ]",
    "in this paper we present , for the first time , microscopic calculations of inelastic cross sections for the triple excitation of giant resonances induced by heavy ion probes .",
    "we use a microscopic approach based on rpa : the mixing of three - phonon states among themselves and with two- and one - phonon states is considered within a boson expansion approach with pauli corrections .",
    "this is equivalent to introduce anharmonicities corrections to the standard harmonic approximations . at the same time",
    "we have also introduced non - linearities in the external field .",
    "the calculations were done by solving semiclassical coupled channel equations , the channels being superpositions of multiphonon states . in previous calculations we have considered only one- and two - phonon states obtaining a good agreement with the experimental cross section .    in this paper we extend these microscopic calculations by including the three - phonon states . by diagonalizing a quartic microscopic hamiltonian in the space of up to three - phonon states",
    "one realizes that a correct description of two - phonon states requires the inclusion of one and three - phonon components .",
    "the anharmonicity in most of the cases is of the order of 1 mev .",
    "calculations of the inelastic cross section for the excitation of one- , two- and three - phonons states have been performed in the framework of this model .",
    "the cross section in the dgr energy region is only slightly modified . thus the previously published results are confirmed . on the contrary , as one could expect , the contribution in the tgr energy region is quite large giving a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we have also performed calculations in the space of up to four - phonon states .",
    "although the inclusion of the four - phonon states is very important in the wave functions and energies of the three - phonon states , giving rise to a much stronger anharmonicity , their influence on the dynamics is very small .",
    "the decomposition of the inelastic cross section into one- , two- and three - phonon components shows the importance of the three contributions in different region of the excitation energy . in the case of @xmath6pb + @xmath6pb at e / a=641",
    "the separation in energy is very clear and one can distinguish the three region of interest , in the @xmath5ca + @xmath5ca at 50 mev / a case the overlap is stronger . in both cases",
    "we get an increase in the triple phonon energy region showing once again the importance of the anharmonicity in the internal hamiltonian and the non - linearity in the external field .",
