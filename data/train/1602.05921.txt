    "pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic variable in many industrial processes .",
    "the study , understanding and prediction of how changes in pressure affect different properties such as solubility parameters , activity coefficients , flory - huggins parameters and interfacial tension , amongst others , is fundamental in the design and application of multi - component products . in particular , the understanding of hydrocarbon - water mixtures at different thermodynamic conditions is essential in the process of oil recovery and other industrial applications . in these systems",
    "the effect of high pressure and temperature in different properties is particularly relevant in order , for example , to improve the displacement kinetics involved during the extraction of oil .",
    "complex capillary responses due to changes in interfacial tension and in cohesion parameters originated by variable thermodynamic conditions in the oil reservoir could have important economic consequences .",
    "the evaluation of these effects is not easy to perform in the laboratory due to the fact that experiments in such extreme conditions are expensive and difficult to handle .",
    "for this reason there are many measurements under atmospheric conditions , but only a few studies at high pressure and temperature are available@xcite .",
    "interfacial tension @xmath0 and cohesion parameters such as the cohesive energy density @xmath1 , the solubility @xmath2 and the flory - huggins @xmath3 parameters are important quantities widely used in different industrial areas such as paints and coatings , pharmaceutics , bio - polymers , membranes , smart materials , etc .",
    "a paramount goal in this area is to establish an accurate and accessible methodology to obtain these parameters for complex mixtures as a function of pressure and temperature .",
    "usually , the solubility parameters are obtained experimentally by means of the heat of vaporization at atmospheric conditions , but in a complex fluid system the components are not totally volatile at different thermodynamic conditions @xcite .",
    "other alternatives such as the use of equations of state could be employed but in this case it is necessary to have a good description of the volume and the density behavior at different temperatures and pressures which is not an easy task .",
    "another common solution has been to consider the internal pressure as a substitute for the solubility parameters @xcite but these two concepts do not describe the same phenomena especially under different thermodynamic conditions @xcite .    as an alternative for the study of this kind of complex systems , multiscale numerical simulation has shown to be a very promissing option @xcite . as different time and",
    "length scales and a big number of components are involved in complex fluids , multiscale modeling involving atomistic and mesoscopic approaches has been considered as an attractive combination for their study . the use of these two techniques permits to simulate large complex systems taking advantage of the collective properties at a mesoscopic level with relatively cheap computational requirements , and also to calculate properties at the atomistic level when necessary .",
    "as it is well known , the collective and cooperative behavior emerge in systems with many particles making possible the use of coarse grained simulations and scaling concepts for their study .",
    "one of these numerical techniques is the dissipative particle dynamic ( dpd ) methodology @xcite which is specially attractive to simulate correctly the hydrodynamics of complex liquids ( for an extensive review of this methodology see for example @xcite ) .",
    "even though the use of classical dpd has been applied to simulate different kinds of systems , its use to model and reproduce real behavior in a dpd fluid at different thermodynamic conditions ( different pressures or temperatures ) , not only in a qualitative but also in a quantitatively way , remains a challenge due to the restricted thermodynamic behavior given by the functional expressions for the conservative force employed .",
    "some efforts have been done in order to describe the thermodynamic properties of real systems with dpd using modifications of the traditional technique through , for example , the so called multibody - dpd ( mdpd)@xcite . in mdpd the conservative force depends not only on the inter - particle separation but also on the instantaneous local particle density which depends on the positions of all other neighboring particles . for this reason , the conservative force in mdpd is a many - body force . using an improved mdpd model some authors @xcite ,",
    "have performed simulations for single and multicomponent systems at constant pressure , including a modified version of the andersen barostat to suppress the unphysical volume oscillations due to pressure changes , simplifying the equilibration of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of pressure using the classical dpd technique has remained unexplored . in traditional dpd",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are obtained using only a single parameter @xmath4 in the conservative force .",
    "recently , one of us has presented the methodology to model the effect of temperature in this kind of simulations via a temperature - dependent repulsive @xmath5 parameter @xcite .",
    "this parametrization allows one to consider the thermodynamic conditions using information at an atomistic level .    in this contribution",
    "we present the technique to study the effect of pressure with the dpd approach , following a similar idea .",
    "to achieve this , we obtain and analyze first the effect of pressure and temperature on the cohesive energy density @xmath6 for the pure components via atomistic simulations , and then calculate the solubility parameters @xmath7 and the flory - huggins @xmath8 parameters in binary liquid - liquid mixtures at different pressures and temperatures . following the standard dpd methodology , we assume that the temperature and pressure dependence of the dpd @xmath9 parameters could be associated directly with @xmath8 .",
    "we probe this direct dependence by modeling the interfacial tension between binary mixtures performing dpd simulations .",
    "we use our model to predict the interfacial tension of benzene - water and n - decane - water mixtures at t = 298 , 323 and 373 k and p = 200 , 400 , 600 , 700 , 800 , 1000 and 1200 atmospheres , and compare with reported experimental data @xcite obtaining an excellent agreement . to our knowledge , this is the first time that dpd simulations at different pressures and temperatures are reported with such exactitude .    in section",
    "ii we describe the general characteristics of dpd methodology and the procedure followed to obtain the pressure dependence of the dpd interaction parameters via the solubility and flory - huggins parameters . in section iii",
    "we discuss the effect of pressure and temperature in the solubility parameters and interfacial tension .",
    "section iv presents the simulation details and the results obtained for the cohesive density energy @xmath1 and the solubility parameters @xmath2 by atomistic simulations at several pressures and temperatures , as well as for the interfacial tension @xmath0 of benzene - water and n - decane - water mixtures performing dpd coarse grained simulations .",
    "finally , some conclusions are discussed in section v.",
    "the core structure of the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation method @xcite is fundamentally the same as a classic molecular dynamics ( md ) algorithm but , in dpd , the particles correspond to coarse  grained structures representing molecular or atomic clusters instead of individual atoms .",
    "the momentum and position of each dpd particle are calculated by solving newton s second law of motion using the total force acting on it at finite time steps .",
    "the main difference involving md and dpd methodology is that , in dpd , the functional structure of the interacting force linking any two particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 is constituted by the sum of three components : a conservative ( @xmath12 ) , a dissipative ( @xmath13 ) , and a random ( @xmath14 ) force .",

    "is known as the repulsive dpd parameter acting between the pair of particles and @xmath23 represents a cutoff distance .",
    "the dissipative and the random forces are defined as :    @xmath24\\hat { \\bm{r}}_{ij } \\,,\\\\",

    "the weight functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on distance and vanish for @xmath34 , they are commonly established as :    @xmath35 ^ 2 = \\begin{cases }      ( 1-r_{ij}/r_c)^2 , & \\text{$(r_{ij } \\leq r_c)$ } \\\\      0 , & \\text{$(r_{ij } > r_c)$}.       \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    the cutoff radius @xmath23 is commonly chosen as the reduced unit of length , @xmath36 , and corresponds to the intrinsic length scale of the dpd model .",
    "the masses of all particles are chosen to be equal to the reduced unit of mass @xmath37 .",
    "the cut - off radius @xmath23 could be written as :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the bead volume , @xmath40 is the coarse graining factor ( it is the number of water molecules per dpd particle ) and can be considered as a real - space renormalization factor , and @xmath41 is the number of dpd beads in a lattice box of side @xmath23 and volume @xmath42 .",
    "for example , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45@xmath46 , we have @xmath47 .    as we have mentioned , thermodynamic quantities in dpd are calculated using only the conservative force @xcite , and for this reason a correct estimation and scaling for the repulsive @xmath4 parameter is fundamental to simulate realistic systems at different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the effect of changes in the random and dissipative forces has been recently studied @xcite showing that the average contribution of these two forces to the pressure is negligible .",
    "for this reason we will focus only on the conservative parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the dpd parametrization needs to be appropriately selected to give an accurate estimate of the real system . for sufficiently large number densities",
    "the dpd equation of state for a monocomponent system is  @xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a numerical constant and @xmath50 are the interaction parameters for identical dpd particles .",
    "this equation shows the dependence on @xmath51 of the interaction parameters . to describe the real system ,",
    "fluctuations in the liquid must be described adequately , and these are determined by the compressibility of the system .",

    "the dimensionless isothermal compressibility for water at standard conditions is @xmath56 , and may be considered to be constant in the pressure range from @xmath57 to @xmath58 mpa to be considered  @xcite . using the dpd equation of state the following relationship emerges :    @xmath59    then , the conservative force parameter for particles of the same type , @xmath50 , may be obtained as    @xmath60 k_b t. \\label{aii}\\ ] ]    these equations give the relationship between the mesoscopic model parameter and the real compressibility of the system .",
    "the free energy density for a dpd monocomponent system is    @xmath61    and for a two - component system @xmath62 where the indices @xmath63 refer to species @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "writing @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we have    @xmath67    where @xmath68 has been identified with the well known flory - huggins parameter .",
    "groot and warren  @xcite found that there is a linear relation between @xmath3 and @xmath69 given by @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we propose that the dependence on temperature and pressure could be then included in the dpd repulsive parameter via the pressure and temperature dependent flory - huggins parameter @xmath8 , and can be generalized as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is a numerical constant @xcite and @xmath8 is given by @xmath74 ^ 2 .",

    "interfacial tensions are obtained by the irving - kirkwood  @xcite method expressing the surface tension from the local components of the pressure tensor .",

    "it is known that the effect of temperature in the interfacial tension is much greater than that of the pressure . usually , the maximum change in the interfacial tension in binary mixtures as a function of pressure , in the range @xmath57 to @xmath58 mpa , is around @xmath82 to @xmath83 dynes / cm ; for this reason the effect of pressure is difficult to observe in the laboratory .",
    "experimental studies using binary mixtures ( benzene / water and n - decane / water ) have suggested the following phenomenological relation over a range of 20 to 150 @xmath84c and for pressures of 200 to 700 atm @xcite :    @xmath85    where @xmath51 is the pressure in atmospheres and @xmath86 in @xmath87c .",

    "some authors @xcite have reported that the pressure coefficient @xmath89 is very small and positive for the case of benzene / water and n - decane / water systems for pressures lower than 700 atmospheres , but experimental results obtained in @xcite for the benzene / water system at pressures higher than 700 atmospheres show a negative pressure coefficient as a consequence of the increased influence in the solubility of the phases when the pressure is increased .",
    "the decrease in the interfacial tension when the pressure is increased has been reported also for binary mixtures of co@xmath91/alkane systems @xcite .",
    "the forces involved in the interfacial tension of multicomponent fluids are intimately related to the solubility and flory - huggins parameters .",
    "the concept of the solubility parameter @xmath2 introduced by hildebrand and scott in 1950 @xcite has been fundamental in the analysis of mixtures and pure compounds in many industrial areas .",
    "it is usually assumed that the solubility parameter consists of a linear combination of contributions from dispersion interactions , polar interactions and hydrogen bonding @xcite : @xmath92    commonly , this parameter is calculated at atmospheric pressure via the heat of vaporization , but in many cases high pressures and temperatures are involved in industrial processes and this procedure could lead to a poor estimate for @xmath2 .",
