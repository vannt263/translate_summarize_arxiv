    "pulsars are rotating magnetized neutron stars which emit beamed electromagnetic radiations from magnetic poles .",
    "these objects are amazing tools to test different theories of fundamental physics , including general relativity , alternative theories of gravity , particle physics , nuclear physics , magnetism , plasma physics , etc .",
    "although the emission from these objects ranges from gamma - ray to radio , here i confine myself only to radio pulsars .",
    "the first radio pulsar was discovered by jocelyn bell in 1967@xcite , and since then , there are new discoveries almost every year .",
    "a total of 2213 pulsars are listed in the atnf pulsar catalogue@xcite ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/expert.html ; march 2013 version ) , out of which 6 are in the small magellanic cloud , 15 are in the large magellanic cloud and 144 are in 28 galactic globular clusters .",
    "spin periods of these pulsars range from 1.4 ms to 12 s. it is commonly believed that pulsars are born with spin periods of around 1 s and then they slow down by loosing their rotational kinetic energy in the form of electromagnetic energy .",
    "fast pulsars are believed to gain rotational kinetic energy as a result of mass transfer from their binary companion@xcite ( or past companions , in the cases of isolated fast pulsars ) .",
    "such pulsars are known as  recycled pulsars \" or  millisecond pulsars \" ( msps ) , and slow pulsars are called  normal \" pulsars . since the exact definition of these categories varies , here i stick to the definition of msps as pulsars with spin periods less than 20 ms .",
    "although , pulsars having somewhat higher spin periods ( upto around 100 ms ) could also gain rotational kinetic energy by accreting matter from their companions ; in those cases , i prefer the term  recycled \" pulsars . in this review",
    ", i try to summarize what has been learnt so far about radio luminosities of pulsars , which is a very important intrinsic property of pulsars and is directly related to the pulsar emission mechanism , the physics of the magnetosphere and the structure of the beam .",
    "flux density is the amount of energy received from an astronomical object per unit area ( of the observing device ) per unit time per unit frequency range .",
    "the unit of flux density is watts per square metre per hertz .",
    "radio astronomers use the unit jansky ( jy ) , where 1 jansky @xmath0 watts per square metre per hertz . as pulsars are comparatively faint objects , their flux densities are usually expressed in millijansky ( mjy ) .",
    "flux density is a measurable quantity , but it is not an intrinsic property of the object .",
    "the intrinsic property of the object is the luminosity , which is the amount of energy radiated by the object per unit time . for an object radiating in a spherically symmetric manner",
    ", the luminosity can be written as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the distance of the object from the observer , @xmath3 is the flux density at any observing frequency @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the lower and upper limits of frequencies over which the object has been observed .",
    "but in the case of radio pulsars , the emission is not spherically symmetric ; rather , it is beamed from two magnetic poles .",
    "so one needs to consider the beaming geometry while defining the luminosity of a radio pulsar as:@xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the radius of the emission cone ( assumed circular ) , @xmath9 is the pulse duty cycle , @xmath10 is the spin period of the pulsar , @xmath11 is the equivalent width of the pulse ( i.e. the width of a top - hat shaped pulse having the same area and peak flux density as the true profile ) . as it is usually difficult to determine the values of @xmath8 and @xmath12 reliably ) is not valid . ] , the parameter  pseudoluminosity \" is defined as @xmath13 note that , although luminosity has the dimension of power , i.e. watts , pseudoluminosity has the dimension of watts per hertz . in pulsar astronomy , pseudoluminosity is expressed in units of @xmath14 , so physical or true luminosity can be expressed in units of @xmath15 .",
    "the common practice is to study pseudoluminosity and refer it as luminosity .",
    "i follow this convention in the present article ( unless otherwise mentioned explicitly ) , with the subscript implying the value of the observing frequency in mhz , e.g. , @xmath16 stands for the pseudoluminosity of a pulsar observed at 400 mhz and @xmath17 stands for the pseudoluminosity of a pulsar observed at 1400 mhz .",
    "it is a well known fact that pulsars are not equally bright at different frequencies .",
    "@xmath18 ( and as a result @xmath3 ) varies with frequency as @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 is known as the  spectral index \" .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is different for different pulsars . for most of them",
    ", it lies in the range of @xmath22 to @xmath23 implying that pulsars are in general brighter at lower frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralindex ] , i show the distribution of spectral indices of 294 pulsars listed in the atnf pulsar catalog ( as of march 2013 ) . this distribution has a mean of @xmath24 and median @xmath25 .",
    "extreme examples are psr j0711@xmath260931 ( @xmath27 ) and psr j1740@xmath261000 ( @xmath28 ) . earlier , maron _",
    "_ @xcite found the mean @xmath21 as @xmath29 using 281 pulsars .",

    "@xcite obtained a mean @xmath21 of @xmath30 for 19 millisecond pulsars ( out of which two are in globular clusters ) .",
    "_ et  al.__@xcite found a mean @xmath21 of @xmath30 for 20 msps in globular clusters .",
    "they used this value to convert flux densities measured at different frequencies to those at 1400 mhz .",
    "they also showed that the luminosity distribution for recycled pulsars in gcs did not vary significantly when @xmath21 changed in the range of @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "this result agreed with the earlier conclusion by hessels _",
    "_ @xcite using 37 isolated pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "recently , using monte - carlo simulations and taking care of observational limits , bates _",
    "_ @xcite have found that the true distribution of spectral indices for potentially observable radio pulsars can be modelled as a gaussian with mean -1.4 and standard deviation 1 .",
    "the rate of loss of the rotational kinetic energy of a pulsar can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rate of change of the spin period , @xmath35 is the angular frequency and @xmath36 is the moment of inertia of the pulsar .",
    "@xmath37 is called the  spin - down luminosity \" and it is the total power output by the pulsar . in the simplified assumption that pulsars are magnetic dipoles , rotating in vacuum , this power can be equated to the total electromagnetic power emitted by the pulsar ( neglecting energy losses in other forms , e.g. , gravitational energy , heat energy , etc . ) . even in that case",
    ", the total power would be distributed over a wide range of frequency .",
    "so it is clear that this spin - down luminosity is a quantity different from the radio luminosity we observe , although according to some theoretical models , this @xmath37 is related to the physical radio luminosity @xmath38 ( eq [ eq : truelum ] ) or even with the pseudoluminosity @xmath18 .",
    "the luminosity of a radio pulsar at a particular observing frequency @xmath4 is commonly expressed by the functional form :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a proportionality constant whose dimension depends upon the values of the indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the units of @xmath10 and @xmath34 . usually @xmath10 is expressed in s and @xmath34 is @xmath43 , but sometimes @xmath34 is given in units of @xmath44 , which changes the value of the constant @xmath40 .",
    "note that when one tries to fit eq .",
    "( [ eq : llppdot1 ] ) to the observed set of pulsars , selection effects play a significant role and the fitted form does not represent the actual population",
    ".    this form was first used by gunn and ostriker@xcite who obtained @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the observed @xmath16 values of 41 pulsars .",
    "this fit can be approximated as @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "they also proposed an exponential decay of the surface magnetic field ( @xmath49 ) with time resulting in a decrease in @xmath16 with time as @xmath50 ( @xmath10 in s and @xmath34 in @xmath43 ) giving @xmath51 .",
    "lyne , manchester , and taylor @xcite favoured @xmath51 law over few other laws they explored , e.g. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . on the other hand , lyne , ritchings , and smith@xcite fitted @xmath16 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 for a sample of 84 pulsars .",
    "the same set of pulsars resulted @xmath56 , @xmath57 in the study by vivekanand and narayan@xcite . using a larger set of 242 pulsars",

    "przybycie@xcite found that @xmath60 , @xmath61 using a sample of 275 pulsars .",
    "stollman@xcite tried to understand the discrepancy between the luminosity law obtained by different people .",
    "he found that @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( chosen by gunn and ostriker ) explained the distribution of pulsars in the @xmath62 plane better , but @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( chosen by prszyski and przybycie ) fitted the observed values of @xmath16 better .",
    "for the first case , he compared a simulated , flux - limited sample of pulsars with the real ones . in his simulation , he chose a normal distribution for the space velocities of pulsars ( with a standard deviation of 100 @xmath65 ) , a lognormal distribution for initial magnetic fields ( with a mean of 12.5 and standard deviation of 0.5 ) , a flat distribution between 1 - 50 ms for initial spin periods , and an exponential decay law for magnetic fields .",
    "soon he proposed a new luminosity law as@xcite :    @xmath66    [ stollmanall ]    eq ( [ stollmana ] ) can be approximated to eq ( [ eq : llppdot1 ] ) with @xmath67 which can be further simplified as @xmath68 .",
    "stollman@xcite also gave a physical explanation for this law within the framework of ruderman - sutherland@xcite model assuming @xmath16 to be proportional to the potential difference across the polar magnetospheric gap .",
    "all the works mentioned so far in this section fitted observed values @xmath16 with observed values of @xmath10 and @xmath34 , without considering the sensitivity of pulsar surveys properly , and these fits were used to explain / predict other observable parameters .",
    "emmering and chevalier@xcite fitted @xmath16 of observed pulsars by eq ( [ eq : llppdot1 ] ) with @xmath69 , @xmath70 which was very close to the fit obtained by prszyski and przybycie .",
    "they took care of selection effects and performed mone - carlo simulations to get the luminosity function for potentially detectable pulsars ( through pulsar surveys performed upto that time ) , as well as the intrinsic pulsar luminosity function .",
    "they assumed that the intrinsic luminosity function had a scatter which could be modelled with a normal distribution with the mean fitted with eq ( [ eq : llppdot1 ] ) , and the measured luminosity was the product of this intrinsic distribution and a lognormal distribution .",
    "they obtained different values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 depending upon the model , e.g. , their model i gave @xmath71 and @xmath72 for detectable pulsars but @xmath73 , @xmath74 for the intrinsic distribution .",

    "that is why instead of using any @xmath257 , @xmath34 dependent luminosity law ( as described in section [ sec : lumlawppdot ] ) , they used simple luminosity distribution functions . using those distribution functions , they generated synthetic samples of pulsar luminosities in each gc and selected only those pulsars which had simulated luminisities greater than the minimum observed luminosity for that gc , until they obtained the desired number of such bright and selected pulsars in each case .",

    "they chose @xmath208 in the range of @xmath270 , as 0.48 @xmath271 was the observed minimum luminosity among gc pulsars in their sample , and the lower value of @xmath208 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "they also chose a maximum luminosity of 50  mjy  kpc@xmath272 and argued that there was no gc pulsar with @xmath273  mjy  kpc@xmath272 , and their results were insensitive to the exact choice of the maximum luminosity cutoff over the range of 20500  mjy  kpc@xmath272 . here",

    "for terzan  5 , the power law models provided better matches to the diffuse flux overall , while the lognormal models predicted slightly smaller fluxes which lied 25@xmath197 below the nominal value found by fruchter and goss@xcite . to constrain the parameter space further , first they worked on the lognormal distribution , where they fixed @xmath195 as @xmath289 and varied @xmath197 .",
    "they noticed that there were only two possible ranges of @xmath197 which were compatible with the diffuse flux from terzan 5 : @xmath290 or @xmath291 , but they preferred the  solution \" with @xmath291 as the set @xmath198 , @xmath292 did not provide good @xmath258 fitting .",

    "the second question is that whether luminosities of radio pulsars depend on the values of @xmath10 and @xmath298 , and if yes then what is the exact form and what is the physical explanation ? why the lognormal function provides a better fit than the conventional power - law ?",
