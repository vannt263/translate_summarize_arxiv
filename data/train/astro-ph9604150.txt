    "a754 , a rich hot cluster of galaxies at @xmath3 ( bird 1994 ) has become the prototype of a merging cluster .",
    "it has been observed by every modern x - ray observatory , and a series of papers in the last few years , based on these data have established that there is evidence of a merger in progress .",
    "fabricant ( 1986 ) used the x - ray imaging data obtained by the einstein ipc and interpreted the elongated shape of the surface brightness distribution as merging subclusters .",
    "henriksen ( 1986 ) fit a @xmath4-model to the einstein imaging data to obtain the gas density profile and utilized a polytropic relationship to predict gas temperature profiles which were then constrained by the heao1-a2 spectra .",
    "these data required non - isothermality in the gas and were consistent with a monotonically decreasing temperature profile with the hottest material in the center and the coolest on the outside . in 1993 , henriksen analyzed heao1-a2 spectra along with einstein ipc and sss spectra and found further evidence of non - isothermality in the gas and that the data were also consistent with a simpler two - component model including a very hot and a cooler gas .",
    "the lack of combined spatial and spectral resolution in the data made the location of the thermal components ambiguous .",
    "henry and briel ( 1995 , hereafter hb ) analyzed rosat pspc data in the energy band 0.52  kev , which provided a high quality image of the cluster as well as spectral constraints .",
    "these authors found that the hot gas is in the general vicinity of the north - west ( nw ) galaxy clump identified by zabludoff and zaritsky ( 1995 ) , while the cluster brightness peak , in the vicinity of the south - east ( se ) galaxy group , has a lower temperature as does the outer region of the cluster atmosphere .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the effect of the subcluster merger on the intracluster medium predict the existence of relatively long - lived spatial temperature variations in the post - merger cluster gas ( e.g. , schindler &  1993 ; roettiger , burns & loken 1993 ; evrard et al .",
    "asca data have spectral and spatial resolution combined with a broad energy band which is sufficient to test these predictions and determine the evolutionary stage of clusters , and put constraints on the physics of cluster mergers . in this letter",
    ", we present an analysis of spatially resolved spectra obtained by asca of a754 , which have provided temperature and abundance maps of the cluster .",
    "a754 was observed by asca ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) for 1518 ks with the sis ( most of it in the 4-ccd mode which covers a square 22@xmath5 22field ) and for 21 ks with the gis .",
    "we used all four asca detectors in the analysis . for reconstruction of the cluster gas temperature map ,",
    "the scheme from markevitch ( 1996 , and references therein ) has been used .",
    "it consists of simultaneous fitting the temperature in all chosen image regions , taking into account the asca mirror scattering .",
    "the mirror point spread function was modeled using cyg  x-1 data for energies above 2  kev ( takahashi et al.1995 ) .",
    "for the energies 1.52  kev where these data are inaccurate , the psf data from the 23 kev interval were used after the appropriate correction for the energy dependence of the gis spatial resolution . including this energy interval in the analysis did not not change the best - fit values noticeably while improving statistics .",
    "we chose to use only energies above 1.5  kev for the spatially - resolved analysis to avoid further extrapolation of the psf model , while using all energies above 0.5  kev in the overall spectrum analysis .",
    "the psf uncertainty of 15% ( 1@xmath6 ) was included in the confidence interval calculation .",
    "there are no bright sources in the vicinity of a754 so a possible stray light contribution ( ishisaki 1996 ) is unimportant for our analysis .",
    "the background was modeled using the blank field observations normalized according to their exposures , and an uncertainty of such normalization of 20% was also included .",
    "a rosat pspc image of the cluster was used as a brightness template as in markevitch ( 1996 ) .",
    "the data from gis and sis were binned in 8 and 7 wide spectral bins , respectively .",
    "the poorly calibrated 22.5  kev interval was excluded ; including it did nt change the best - fit values significantly but made @xmath7 worse .",
    "iron abundance and the absorbing column were assumed constant at their ginga and galactic values , respectively , and varying them did nt change the best - fit temperatures significantly .",
    "the psf effects are most important for the regions of low relative surface brightness , while in many cases one can get a meaningful temperature estimate for the brightness peak regions by fitting its spectrum directly without accounting for the added scattered flux .",
    "we have performed such fits including lower energies for several regions , to cross - check the results of the general method .",
    "the gis - measured luminosity of a754 in the 0.510  kev band is @xmath8 ergs  s@xmath9 , where @xmath10 km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the emission - weighted temperature using all four detectors is @xmath11 kev ( 9  kev using the energy interval of 1.511 kev used for the temperature map ) , in agreement with the 90% confidence range for ginga , @xmath12 kev and heao1-a2 , 7.89.0 kev .",
    "the abundance , 0.26@xmath130.05 , is derived fitting a single component raymond and smith model with xspec utilizing the solar ratios in allen ( 1973 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the ginga value of 0.27@xmath130.04 , confirming that a754 has a metallicity typical of a rich cluster .",
    "the heao1-a2 values are taken from henriksen ( 1993 ) and the ginga results from arnaud ( 1994 ) .",
    "a two - dimensional temperature map is shown in fig .  1 , in which the asca temperatures ( grayscale ) are overlaid on the rosat pspc surface brightness contours . the regions in which the temperatures were reconstructed are nine 5 arcmin boxes in the inner part , and four segments of the 16 arcmin - radius circle in the outer part .",
    "as anticipated for a cluster undergoing merger , the temperature distribution is significantly non - uniform : regions 1 , 4 , 7 and 8 along the cluster axis , are hotter than the cluster average at a greater than 90% confidence , while regions 10 and 13 on the outside are significantly cooler .",
    "the obtained temperatures generally agree with hb s rosat pspc values within the much larger rosat errors .",
    "exceptions are our regions 6 and 12 whose asca temperatures are consistent with the average , while hb s",
    "values for approximately the same regions are higher , however at a low statistical significance . in the region approximately corresponding to our region 2 + 3 which includes the cluster brightness peak , hb detected a significantly lower temperature than ours .",
    "we have looked into the disagreement and found that when a smaller region centered on the pspc brightness peak is considered and the lower energies are included in the analysis ( without the psf correction , see section above ) , our best - fit temperature is lower , see table  1 .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum in this region may be multicomponent , and the origin of the discrepancy is in the higher sensitivity of pspc to the lower - temperature component while asca is picking the higher - temperature component .",
    "we have also made an estimate without the psf correction for some other selected regions .",
    "the region centered on the se galaxy group ( fabricant et al .",
    "1986 ; zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ) , 3  to the south from the pspc peak , also appears cooler . for a circle centered on the nw galaxy group ( about 4  westward from the center of the region 8 in the temperature map ) , the simple analysis yields a high temperature , 11.5  kev , in agreement with that from the full analysis .",
    "it may be worth noticing that using the concentric annuli around the cluster center , both with and without correcting for the psf , would conceal the complex temperature structure of this cluster ( see table  1 ) within the central 20 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged temperature appears to drop with radius beyond @xmath14  mpc , as seen from fig .  1 .    for the first time we have attempted to reconstruct a two - dimensional abundance map of this cluster .",
    "abundance variations may be an important diagnostic in assessing gas mixture expected from the turbulence generated by the subcluster merger . to derive the abundances in the regions for which the temperatures have been obtained while avoiding fitting an unmanageable number of free parameters",
    ", we have fixed the temperatures at their best - fit values obtained with constant abundances .",
    "it is a justifiable thing to do because the asca energy resolution and energy coverage are sufficient to separate fitting of the temperature and the abundance .",
    "the resulting abundances in the individual regions are given in table  2 .",
    "the abundance constraints are poor , due to the insufficient statistics of the asca observation , with most of the abundances consistent with the average within the 68% confidence intervals .",
    "we will return to the abundances in the section below .",
    "summarizing the findings of rosat and asca , a754 is significantly non - isothermal .",
    "there is a ridge of hot gas located approximately alongside the cluster elongation axis , with the highest temperatures in the area of the nw galaxy concentration .",
    "the x - ray brightness peak , elongated in the direction perpendicular to the cluster axis , contains gas which is significantly cooler than the cluster average , as are the cluster outskirts toward north and east .",
    "the question which we would like to address using our derived temperature distribution is the evolutionary history of a754 .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations of cluster mergers ( e.g. , schindler &  1993 ; roettiger , burns & loken 1993 ; pearce et al .",
    "1994 ) predict that as a result of a recent or ongoing merger , the cluster should have a strongly peaked temperature distribution with the highest temperature at the site of the subcluster collision , accompanied by hot lobes perpendicular to the collision axis .",
    "briel & henry ( 1994 ) reported on the detection of such hot lobes in another cluster , a2256 , using rosat pspc .",
    "however , their existence was not confirmed by asca ( markevitch 1996 ) , who also failed to detect the central temperature peak in that cluster .",
    "using asca data , arnaud et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and markevitch et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported irregular temperature structure in perseus and in a2163 , respectively , attributing it to the merger effects , although the former have ignored the psf scattering while the statistical significance of the latter result was marginal .",
    "a754 remains the only cluster for which there is a significant and unambiguous indication of the irregular temperature structure expected in a merger , providing the first possibility to compare it with theoretical predictions .    if one assumes , in line with all previous studies of a754 , that the merger in this cluster proceeds in the direction of the cluster elongation , one expects to find a temperature structure quite different from what is observed .",
    "we offer two possible explanations for this .",
    "one is that unlike in the simulations which considered highly supersonic ( @xmath1 3000 km  s@xmath9 ) mergers , the subcluster collision velocity is low and the post - shock gas temperature , proportional to the upstream shock velocity squared , is not significantly high .",
    "analysis of optical data indicates that mergers may likely occur at a lower velocity , for example , @xmath15 km  s@xmath9 for a98 ( beers , geller & huchra 1982 ) and @xmath1 1500 km  s@xmath9 for a3395 ( henriksen & jones 1996 ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity difference of the galaxy clumps in a754 is very low , about 100 km  s@xmath9 ( zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ) though application of a simple dynamical model by these authors results in a post - merger , relative velocity of @xmath16 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "however , the observed heating along the cluster axis remains to be explained in this scenario .",
    "a more plausible explanation is a merger with a non - zero impact parameter .",
    "evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show a simulation of a merger which is reprinted here as our fig .  2 and is strikingly similar to a754 .",
    "in this scenario , the merger proceeds in the image plane with the subunits infalling from north and south with the impact parameter @xmath17 mpc , as shown by the gas velocity arrows in the left panel of fig .  2 ( gas is expected to drag behind the dark matter during a merger . ) the hottest region is at the site of the nw group penetrating the larger subunit , and the brightness elongation to the south is the tail of this group .",
    "the plume of cool gas at the x - ray brightness peak is the stripped atmosphere , and perhaps even a cooling flow , belonged to the subunit associated with the se galaxy group , its elongation ( more clearly seen in the full resolution rosat image presented in hb ) pointing in the direction of that group s infall .",
    "the fact that the cold gas still exists in the cluster may indicate that the merger has not proceeded very far and this is the first encounter of the subclusters .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if any large - scale elemental abundance differences exist , indicating that the gas belonged to different subclusters and still retains its identity ( if the subunit s abundances have been different ) .",
    "we have averaged the abundances over the north - east ( regions 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 13 in fig .",
    "1 ) and the south - west ( regions 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 ) areas of the cluster associated with the two infalling subunits ( excluding the regions 1 , 5 , 9 ) , and found the abundances of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( 68% intervals ) , respectively .",
    "they are consistent within the statistical errors , although there is a hint of difference and it would be interesting to measure them with a better accuracy .    to conclude , using asca data , we have found a prominent structure in the temperature map of a754 and put some constraints on the abundances in the different cluster regions .",
    "all of the evidence , including the x - ray image and the optical galaxy distribution , is consistent with a non - head - on merger proceeding with high velocity in the image plane . with such favorable viewing angle and the merger stage",
    ", a754 is an ideal laboratory to test various evolutionary scenarios .",
