    "<S> planar reconstruction patterns at the zigzag and armchair edges of graphene were investigated with density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> it was unexpectedly found that the zigzag edge is metastable and a planar reconstruction spontaneously takes place at room temperature </S>",

    "<S> carbon is one of the most prominent elements in nature , vital for biology and life . </S>",
    "<S> although macroscopic carbon has been important since ancient times@xcite , only modern materials design , utilizing nanotubes@xcite , fullerenes@xcite and single graphene sheets@xcite , fully attempts to use its flexible chemistry . in applications for nanoscale materials and devices , it is often the atomic and electronic structure of boundaries and surfaces that is responsible for mechanical , electronic and chemical properties .    since the properties of nanomaterial depend on the precise atomic geometry , its knowledge is crucial for focused preparation of experiments and for worthy theoretical modeling . only this enables the further development of nanoelectronic components , nanoelectromechanical devices and hydrogen storage materials@xcite , or the usage of carbon in compound designs@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of precise geometry is emphasized in low - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> the strong correlations are known to bring up novel phenomena@xcite , and such should be expected also for the quasi - one - dimensional edges of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the edge chemistry plays even crucial role in the catalyzed growth of carbon nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , as two - dimensional carbon has the honeycomb lattice , edge behaviour ultimately boils down to the properties of graphene edges . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is relevant to explore different graphene edge geometries and their chemical properties beyond the standard zigzag and armchair ones .    </S>",
    "<S> this relevance is evident from the abundant literature . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic properties of graphene as well as carbon nanotube armchair and zigzag edges have been studied extensively@xcite , often in connection to nanotube growth@xcite or the so - called electronic `` edge states''@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there has been experimental and theoretical work done even on the reconstruction of graphene edges , but they have differed from the basic reconstruction patterns studied in this work . they have involved either edge roughness@xcite or more dramatic folding of the edge into a loop@xcite .    , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all geometries are strictly in plane.,width=321 ]    the edges discussed in this work are shown in figure  [ fig : edges ] , and were investigated by modeling an infinitely long carbon nanoribbon of a given width ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> tight - binding method@xcite was used to explore number of other edge candidates , but density - functional analysis only for the relevant ones is reported here . </S>",
    "<S> the most important edge is zz(57 ) , a reconstruction of zigzag edge where two hexagons transform into a pentagon and a heptagon , like an edge cut through a haeckelite structure or a line of stone - wales defects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the edge ac(677 ) is a reconstruction of the armchair edge where two separate `` armrest '' hexagons merge into adjacent heptagons by stone - wales mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the pentagonal reconstruction ac(56 ) of armchair has a slightly different nature , since it requires the diffusion of carbon atoms from distant `` armrests '' to `` seat '' positions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start analysis by looking at edge energy @xmath3 , which is calculated from the total energy of the graphene ribbon @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of carbon atoms , @xmath6 the total length of edges ( twice the length of simulation cell ) , and @xmath7  ev is the cohesion energy of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the edge energies converge rapidly as shown in figure  [ fig : width ] and justify the reference to ( semi - infinite ) graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of armchair edge is @xmath8  ev /   lower than for zigzag edge , in accord with a similar value for nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the principal result is that by edge reconstruction zigzag may lower its energy by @xmath9  ev /  . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the _ reconstructed zigzag is the best edge for graphene_. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report on the metastability of the zigzag edge , which is surprising in view of the abundant literature </S>",
    "<S> . thermal stability of this novel reconstruction was also confirmed with tight - binding simulations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ac(677 ) edge has only slightly higher energy than the armchair edge , whereas ac(56 ) reconstruction has the highest edge energy . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the reconstructions appear to be stable with respect to out - of - plane motion , a situation somewhat different from small - diameter nanotubes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .,width=302 ]    these energetics can be understood by looking at the geometries of figure  [ fig : edges ] . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have shown that armchair has low energy due to triple bonds in the `` armrests''@xcite , as realized by comparing their short bonds ( @xmath10   ) to the bond in acetylene ( @xmath11   ) . </S>",
    "<S> zigzag does not have such triple bonds and ends up with strong and expensive dangling bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed zz(57 ) has triple bonds ( @xmath10   ) but also wider bond angles ( @xmath12 ) which reduces the hybridization energy cost . </S>",
    "<S> triple bonds with wide angles can be observed also in ac(677 ) edge , but strain in other parts makes the reconstruction unfavoured . </S>",
    "<S> the ac(56 ) edge suffers from dangling bonds like zigzag , and additional high strain energy makes this reconstruction the most expensive one . </S>",
    "<S> regardless , ac(56 ) edge has relevance during the growth of armchair edges@xcite .     with coverage of one hydrogen per edge atom and lower </S>",
    "<S> faint symbols are shifted by subtracting the h@xmath13 binding energy ; positive @xmath14 means the hydrogen atom is more strongly bound to the edge than to h@xmath13 molecule.,width=302 ]    these observations are supported by hydrogen atom adsorption energies , shown in figure  [ fig : ads ] . </S>",
    "<S> the weak adsorption for armchair ( @xmath15  ev ) compared to zigzag ( @xmath16  ev ) stems from the triple bonds in the armchair edge . similarly the weak adsorption for zz(57 ) ( @xmath17  ev ) and ac(677 ) ( @xmath18  ev ) witnesses the weakening of dangling bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption for ac(56 ) is large because of the strongest dangling bonds . for insight </S>",
    "<S> , the adsorption energies in figure  [ fig : ads ] are replotted by subtracting hydrogen molecule binding energy @xmath19  ev . the resulting negative number for zz(57 ) means that the adsorption of hydrogen atom from h@xmath13 molecule is not favored due to cost of h@xmath13 dissociation energy , unless the adsorption process should be complicated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to the conclusion that _ the edge reconstruction chemically passivates zigzag edge_. however , hydrogen adsorption for zigzag@xmath20hydrogen edge has yet smaller adsorption energy of @xmath21  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge energetics are summarized in table  [ tab : ads ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the ordering of edges changes when expressed as energy per edge atom ( @xmath22 ) due to different edge atom densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> more interesting is to look at edges with hydrogen termination ( klein edge)@xcite . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the edge energy is @xmath25 , where the reference is to bulk graphene and h@xmath13 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the best edges in this case are normal armchair and zigzag edges because of dangling bonds . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the weak dangling bonds and small adsorption energy causes high energies for zz(57 ) and ac(677 ) klein edges .    </S>",
    "<S> .summary of the edge and hydrogen adsorption energies . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is the energy per edge atom , @xmath27 the hydrogen adsorption energy with full edge coverage , and @xmath28 is the edge energy with hydrogen termination . </S>",
    "<S> note that for ac(56 ) the edge atom density is @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]       wide zigzag and zz(57 ) nanoribbons , respectively , with unit cell width of @xmath30   . </S>",
    "<S> note that for zigzag this is twice the minimum unit cell and the reciprocal space is thus only half of the normal representation . the dashed line is the fermi - level . </S>",
    "<S> the bands coloured were identified directly by visual inspection of the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) show the height profiles of simulated scanning tunneling microscope images in constant current mode of the respective edges ( height variations @xmath31  </S>",
    "<S>  ) , formed by integrating the electron density from occupied bands within 0.1 ev of the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracies at the gamma - point are 2 and 4 for the dangling bonds and the flat band , respectively.,width=321 ]    let us now concentrate on the thermodynamic and electronic properties of zigzag edges . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to clarify an aspect which is ambiguous in the literature : there are two types of electronic zigzag edge states . the so - called `` flat band '' in figure  [ fig : electr]a comes from the bulk @xmath32-electrons and is indeed localized at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> but the band due to dangling bonds is the one seen in the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) image and is located spatially even beyond the edge ( figure  [ fig : electr]c ) . in zz(57 ) formation of triple bonds is evidenced by the nearly isolated dimers in figure  [ fig : electr]d , and the reconstruction removes the dangling bond bands away from the fermi - level by lifting the degeneracy almost by @xmath33  ev . </S>",
    "<S> hence for zz(57 ) the stm image shows only the `` flat band '' states . because the dangling bond bands shift to elusive energies , also chemical reactivity reduces .    in thermodynamic sense the spontaneous reconstruction of zigzag into zz(57 ) should be possible , since the activation barrier from the zigzag side is only @xmath34  ev , from the reconstructed side @xmath35  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the g - mode vibration of graphene at @xmath36  @xmath37 gives an attempt frequency of @xmath38  s@xmath39 , and elementary approach yields the rapid rate @xmath40  s@xmath39 at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructions predicted in this work are expected to survive on graphite terraces due to the weak interaction ( @xmath41  mev / atom ) between the basal planes@xcite . using appropriate sample preparation it should be thus possible to observe the reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> stm images often show irregular and blurred edges , yielding no atomic resolution , but at least for passivated edges armchair predominance is claimed , in agreement with table  [ tab : ads]@xcite . so far samples have been prepared intentionally with hydrogen passivation during heat treatment@xcite , a situation where reconstruction would not be favored . </S>",
    "<S> alternate routes for observing the reconstruction would be the radial distribution function from neutron diffraction experiments without deuterium atmosphere@xcite , or detection of triple bond -spawned high - energy modes around @xmath42  @xmath37 with raman spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> a further topic is the study of the conductance of various graphene edges , particularly the zz(57 ) edge found here . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the edge state around the fermi level makes zz(57 ) ideal for conductance measurements , in contrast to armchair ribbons where the edge state is absent . </S>",
    "<S> this may render zz(57 ) as an interesting stable model for quasi - one - dimensional carbyne with alternating single and triple bonds . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the novel thermodynamically and chemically stable reconstruction could play a role in formation of angular joints in nanoribbons@xcite , closure of the ends of nanotubes after cutting@xcite and any other system where graphene sheets are joined to produce systems with nano - scale morphology . </S>"
