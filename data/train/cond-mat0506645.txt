    "in the case of low temperatures , the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can be described in a mean  field approach by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) or gross  pitaevskii equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ( - ^2 + v(x ) + g |(x , t)|^2 ) ( x , t ) = i , [ eqn - nlse - timedep ] where @xmath0 is the nonlinear interaction strength .",
    "another important application of the nonlinear schrdinger equation is the propagation of electromagnetic waves in nonlinear media ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter 8) .    due to the possibility to control all experimental parameters accurately over wide ranges and monitor the dynamics of a bec in situ ,",
    "these have become one of the most prominent models for the study of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "an increasing number of important nonlinear phenomena has been demonstrated experimentally in the last decade , such as the motion of dark @xcite and bright solitons @xcite and the self - trapping effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the nlse in confined geometries ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an excellent review of nonlinear phenomena in becs can be found in the recent article by carretero - gonzlez _ et al .",
    "a particular important subdiscipline is the study of the nonlinear dynamics of ultracold atoms and becs in periodic potentials since these systems provide excellent model systems for fundamental problems in condensed matter physics ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) . among other phenomena , recent experiments have demonstrated the excistence of gap solitons @xcite and of looped bloch bands and the corresponding dynamical instability @xcite as well as nonlinear de- and rephasing @xcite .    in this paper paper we will present an analytic study of stationary states of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , i.e. states of the form @xmath1 , in a one - dimensional periodic potential .",
    "these states satisfy the time - independent nlse ( - + v(x ) + g |(x)|^2 ) ( x ) = ( x ) [ eqn - nlse - general ] with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    "we adopt a novel approach to nonlinear stationary states by exploiting the analogy to nonlinear dynamical systems in considering the wave function @xmath4 as a dynamical variable .",
    "although a bit unusual , this approach leads to a variety of important results , explaining several phenomena umambigiously in the language of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "for instance , the appearance of period - doubled bloch bands , as described previously in @xcite , is readily understood as a familiar period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "similarly , the bifurcation leading to the appearance of looped bloch bands is easily understood so that it is possible to calculate the critical nonlinearity for this process _",
    "analytically_. from a fundamental point of view it becomes clear that bloch states , i.e. solutions which are periodic up to a phase factor @xmath5 , are extremely fragile objects .",
    "while in the linear case @xmath6 all states are bloch states or linear combinations of degenerate bloch states according to bloch s theorem , these states are of measure zero in the nonlinear case @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that almost all solutions are only quasi - periodic for @xmath7 , approaching a true periodicity smoothly in the limit @xmath8 . with increasing strength of the nonlinearity , more and more (",
    "quasi)-periodic orbits are lost and chaos sets in in the wake of a period doubling process .",
    "spatial chaoticity usually implies a divergence of the wave function .",
    "thus , well - behaved nonlinear stationary states are very rare for certain parameter values , in fact large interaction constants .    as a convenient model for a space - periodic structure ,",
    "we consider a particular simple model system , the delta - comb potential v(x ) = _ n ( x- d n ) = _ d(x ) .",
    "[ eqn - delta - pot ] the potential ( [ eqn - delta - pot ] ) has the great advantage that analytical solutions of the nlse can be constructed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions @xcite",
    ". analytic solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation for a non - vanishing potential @xmath9 are very rare and hence it will be of interest to study such a potential in some detail .",
    "its linear counterpart represents a basic model for a quantum mechanical bloch system ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . a generalization to a more realistic setup consisting of a periodic series of gaussian potential barriers",
    "will be discussed at the end of this paper .",
    "narrow gaussian potential barriers can be realized in a good approximation in current atom - chip experiments ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for example the resonant transport of becs through two such peaks is analyzed in @xcite .",

    "up now , quite a number of articles were devoted to the important problem of nonlinear stationary states in a periodic potential and we refer to the review articles @xcite for an overview .",
    "there also have been some papers devoted to the nlse with a delta - comb potential , however focusing on completly different aspects .",
    "bound states were studied in @xcite and the nonlinear transport problem through such a series of barriers was discussed in @xcite .",

    "it should also be noted that bound states of nonlinear schrdinger equations with a nonlinear periodic microstructure where @xmath17 is space - periodic have been explored @xcite .    in particular this paper",

    "further exactly solvable examples can be found when the potential is given in terms of jacobi elliptic functions @xcite .    in quantum systems , however , we also encounter complex solutions of the nlse discussed in sections [ sec - bloch - bands ] and [ sec - gauss ] in the context of nonlinear bloch bands and the temporal evolution of a wave function , which is governed by the _ time - dependent _ nlse .",
