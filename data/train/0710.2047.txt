    "the first 26 models ( @xmath24 ) belong to the class of low - mass stars and show the universal slow cooling behavior .",
    "the next @xmath25 star has a small central kernel with the enhanced neutrino emission and shows much faster cooling ( is much colder than all observed sources ) .",
    "all other more massive stars cool even faster via the direct urca process and belong to the family of cold massive rapidly cooling stars .",
    "evidently , these cooling curves can not explain the data .",
    "a majority of realistic cooling scenarios , constructed up to now , satisfy the following basic phenomenological concept :    \\(1 ) low - mass stars undergo slow neutrino cooling .",
    "\\(2 ) massive stars cool much faster via neutrino emission from their inner cores .",
    "\\(3 ) there is a family of medium - mass stars whose cooling is intermediate between the slow and fast ones .",
    "accordingly , the density profile of the neutrino emissivity in a neutron star core can look like that plotted in fig .",
    "[ concept]a ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 mark the density range , where the slow cooling transforms into the fast one .",
    "this @xmath28 profile translates into a characteristic dependence of the neutrino luminosity @xmath29 on the stellar mass shown in fig .",
    "[ concept]b ; the transition between the slow cooling to the fast one takes place in the mass range from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "thus , at the present stage of investigation , the cooling theory _ has potential to test four main parameters _ of the neutrino emissivity function @xmath28 or the luminosity function @xmath32 .",
    "they specify the lower and upper levels of neutrino emission ( either @xmath33 and @xmath34 or @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and the position of the transition zone between the slow and fast emission ( either @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "two examples @xcite of successful realization of the above scheme are given in figs .",
    "[ cool4]c and d. the figures show the cooling curves for neutron stars of @xmath37 with strong proton superfluidity ( 1p or 2p ) in the core ( but with normal neutrons ) .",
    "the density profiles @xmath38 of the proton critical temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ tcrho]a ; they are phenomenological and can be regarded as illustrative . in the outer core ,",
    "proton superfluidity is strong and suppresses the modified urca process .",
    "accordingly , the slow neutrino emission of low - mass stars is determined by weaker neutrino bremsstrahlung in neutron - neutron collisions .",
    "this rises the surface temperature of low - mass stars and allows one to explain observations of hottest sources .",
    "in addition , proton superfluidity penetrates into the inner core ( @xmath39 ) and suppresses the direct urca process within the penetration depth .",
    "it broadens the direct urca threshold and realizes a smooth transition from slowly to rapidly cooling neutron stars with the growth of @xmath40 .",
    "superfluidity 2p penetrates deeper than 1p which widens the range of masses of medium - mass stars .",
    "one can now explain observations of all the sources , including the coldest ones .",
    "moreover , these scenarios predict the existence of very cold massive neutron stars ( which have not been observed so far ) .",
    "if the eos and the critical temperature @xmath38 in the stellar core were known , one would be able to `` weigh '' neutron stars @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mass of the vela pulsar would be @xmath41 for superfluidity 1p and @xmath42 for 2p .",
    "unfortunately , neither eos nor @xmath38 are known and the `` weighing '' procedure is ambiguous .",
    "nevertheless , as a rule , the ambiguity does not destroy the mass ordering of cooling stars .",
    "for instance , the vela pulsar is expected to be more massive than rx j08224300 .",
    "moreover , one can invert the scheme and state that had the mass of one or several cooling neutron stars been measured , one could constrain the eos and @xmath38 .",
    "one can construct many other models of cooling neutron stars consistent with the data .",
    "one can take other eoss in the core [ with other direct urca thresholds @xmath18 and functions @xmath38 ] .",
    "for instance , one can assume the presence of strong neutron superfluidity and normal protons ( because cooling curves are nearly symmetric @xcite with respect to exchanging neutron and proton @xmath38 profiles ) .",
    "the direct urca threshold can also be broadened by nuclear effects ( e.g. , of pion polarization ; see @xcite and references therein ) or by superstrong magnetic fields @xmath44  g @xcite in a nonsuperfluid neutron star core .",

    "( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) : ranges of @xmath7 ( hatched ) for the three types of fast emission compared with observations ( see text for details ) . ]    after several examples we can turn to a general analysis .",
    "one can show that it is sufficient to lower the neutrino luminosity due to the modified urca process in a low - mass star by a factor of @xmath45 to explain observations of stars hottest for their age .",
    "this low neutrino luminosity can be produced by nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the modified urca process can be reduced by nucleon superfluidity , as in the above examples ( figs .",
    "[ cool4]c and d ) .",
    "the level of fast neutrino emission in high - mass stars is less certain . to analyze it ,",
    "let us consider ( fig .",
    "[ exotica ] ) three typical levels appropriate to the direct urca process in nucleon / hyperon matter ; to pion - condensed matter ; and kaon - condensed matter . a schematic picture of the neutrino emissivity profiles through the stellar core for these scenarios is presented in fig .",
    "[ exotica]a .",
    "[ exotica]b shows the ranges of @xmath7 ( hatched regions ) which can be explained by the theory assuming the scenario with the direct urca process .",
    "the upper curve shows cooling of low - mass stars via neutron - neutron bremsstrahlung neutrino emission ( as in figs .",
    "[ cool4]c and d ) .",
    "the lower curve presents fast cooling of a maximum - mass star with direct urca process open in the inner core .",
    "any value of @xmath7 between these two curves can be explained by a cooling of a star with some intermediate mass . as discussed above",
    ", this scenario explains all the data and predicts the existence of very cold neutron stars .",
    "[ exotica]c refers to the scenario with pion - condensation .",
    "the upper cooling curve is the same as in fig .",
    "[ exotica]b ( because low - mass stars have no inner cores ) , but the lower curve goes essentially higher ( because the neutrino emission due to pion condensation is lower than due to direct urca process ) .",
    "this scenario also explains all the sources and predicts the existence of cold stars , but not so cold as in the direct urca case .",
    "[ exotica]d is a similar plot for the scenario with kaon - condensation in the inner core .",
    "high - mass stars cool slower than in the previous scenarios , but all the data are still explained and a population of stars slightly colder than the observed ones is predicted .",
    "thus , all three scenarios are currently consistent with the observations , but predict different families of cold stars .",
    "similar conclusions have been made by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "calculations show that the the neutrino luminosity in the inner core should be @xmath4630100 times higher than the modified urca luminosity to explain all the sources and leave no space for neutron stars colder than the observed ones .",
    "a discovery of very cold neutron stars would be crucial to firmly constrain the enhanced neutrino emission level .",
    "unfortunately , current observations give no reliable constraints on the position of the transition layer between slowly and fastly neutrino emitting regions in the core ( on @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ concept ] ) .",
    "we do not discuss in detail many aspects of the cooling theory but mention them here .",
    "first , cooling can also be regulated by heat conduction in the neutron star crust . the thermal conductivity in the crust can be affected by composition of the matter ( e.g. , by the presence of light elements in accreted surface layers ) and magnetic fields ( in the outer and inner crust ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , these cooling regulators are usually not as strong as neutrino emission from the core .",
    "the effects of superfluidity can be more sophisticated than described above .",
    "taking different eoss [ different direct urca thresholds and @xmath38 profiles ] one can obtain a complicated zoo of families of cooling neutron stars @xcite .",
    "neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of baryons can affect the cooling in many ways as reviewed in refs .",
    "in particular , a moderately strong neutron superfluidity in the nucleon core can enhance the neutrino luminosity over the modified urca level by a factor of @xmath4730 , allowing one to explain the coldest observed sources by neutrino emission from the nucleon ( non - exotic ) core without invoking the direct urca process .",
    "this leads to the scenario of `` minimal cooling '' @xcite .",
    "cooling of neutron stars can be accompanied by some reheating associated , for instance , with the dissipation of differential rotation , deviation from beta - equilibrium or decay of magnetic fields in neutron star interiors .",
    "the magnetic reheating can be especially strong in magnetars ( see below ) .",
    "otherwise these reheating mechanisms are expected to be significant in old neutron stars ( at the photon cooling stage ) .",
    "they are reviewed in @xcite .    finally , we have not discussed cooling of strange stars and neutron stars with quark cores .",
    "a comprehensive review is given in @xcite .",
    "with the spectacular progress of neutron star observations , cooling problem becomes more connected to other aspects of neutron star physics .",
    "first , cooling of isolated neutron stars is closely related to deep crustal heating of transiently accreting neutron stars in soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) .",
    "the matter accreted on a neutron star becomes eventually compressed by the weight of newly accreted material and sinks thus into the crust .",
    "sinking into the deep crust is accompanied by nuclear transformations @xcite and associated heating of the entire star ( @xmath48 mev per one accreted nucleon ) .",
    "this deep crustal heating can keep thermally inertial stars warm @xcite even in quiescent states of sxts when accretion is switched off .",
    "it is likely responsible for thermal emission observed from some sxts in quiescent states ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one can distinguish two heating regimes . as a rule ,",
    "accretion episodes are not too long ( weeks - months ) and do not violate isothermality of internal layers .",
    "these stars reach thermal quasiequilibrium determined by the mass accretion rates @xmath49 averaged over their global thermal relaxation time ( @xmath50 yr ) .",
    "observations of these objects test essentially the same physics of neutron star interior as observations of cooling isolated neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the data on sxts @xcite generally agrees with the above analysis of cooling neutron stars , but with important exceptions .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath51 in quiescent states of the transiently accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 and possibly the sxt 1h 1905 + 000 are very low , giving an example of very cold neutron stars ( missing so far in the data on cooling neutron stars ) . if true , these neutron stars undergo strong neutrino cooling via direct urca process .",
    "however , in view of uncertainties associated with the deep crustal heating hypothesis , determination of @xmath51 and @xmath49 , these results should be taken with caution .    some sxts ( ks  1731260 and mxb 165929 , e.g. , @xcite ) show long accretion episodes ( a few years and more ) in which the crust may become much warmer than the core .",
    "after accretion stops , the crust cools and thermally equilibrates with the core .",
    "this crust - core relaxation is reflected in the relaxation of the surface temperature @xmath52 , that is observed and can give important information on the crust and core physics @xcite .",
    "cooling theory is also employed to study thermal states of magnetars .",
    "it seems one needs to introduce a reheating ( most probably produced by strong magnetar magnetic fields ) to explain high observed x - ray luminosities of magnetars .",
    "one can study quasistationary thermal states of magnetars ( e .. g . , @xcite ) and afterburst relaxation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , cooling theory can be used to analyze the propagation of thermal waves in neutron stars during x - ray bursts and superbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to explore cooling of vibrating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "since the data are becoming numerous it is possible to combine cooling theory with neutron star statistics @xcite .",
    "the theory of cooling neutron stars of ages @xmath53 yr mostly tests the neutrino emission properties of the neutron star core .",
    "its main results are as follows .",
    "\\(2 ) neutrino emission in the inner core ( of a massive star ) is at least a factor of 30100 higher than the modified urca emission .",
    "it can be enhanced by direct urca process in nucleon / hyperon inner core or by the presence of pion or kaon condensate , or quark matter .",
    "( 3 ) the scenario with open direct urca process predicts the existence ( fig .  [ exotica ] ) of massive isolated neutron stars which are much colder than those observed now . in the scenario with pion condensate",
    ", the massive stars should be warmer ( than those with open direct urca ) but colder than the observed ones . in the scenario with kaon condensate",
    "the massive stars should be even warmer but slightly colder than the observed sources",
    ". a discovery of cold cooling neutron stars would be crucial to constrain the level of enhanced neutrino emission in the inner core .",
    "\\(4 ) observations of cooling neutron stars can be analyzed together with observations of sxts in quiescent states .",
    "the data on sxts indicate the existence of very cold neutron stars ( first of all , sax j1808.43658 ) which cool via direct urca process , but the data and interpretation require additional confirmation .",
    "\\(5 ) a transition from slow neutrino emission in the outer core to enhanced emission in the inner core has to be smooth .",
    "current observations of cooling neutron stars and sxts do not constrain the parameters of this transition . a firm measurement of masses of cooling or accreting stars would help to impose such constraints .",
    "\\(6 ) new observations and reliable practical theories of dense matter are vitally important to tune the cooling theory as an instrument for exploring physical properties of neutron star interiors and neutron star parameters",
    ". the tuning will imply a careful analysis of many cooling regulators .",
