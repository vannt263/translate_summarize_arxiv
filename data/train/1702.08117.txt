    "most stars are thought to form in clusters within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "gmcs have typical hydrogen number densities of @xmath0 , diameters of @xmath1tens of parsecs , masses of up to @xmath2 , and average temperatures of @xmath3 .",

    "* ) , high volume densities ( @xmath8 ) , relatively compact sizes ( @xmath1few pc ) , and masses ( @xmath9 ) indicate that they have the potential to be the precursors to most of the observed mass range of star clusters known in the galaxy .",
    "the initial and early stages of star cluster formation can also be traced by dust continuum emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by samples based on emission of dense gas tracers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". surveys of young embedded stars also can probe the structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and kinematics of young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently , the dominant processes that induce the collapse and fragmentation of gmcs into star - forming clumps are poorly understood .",
    "various theoretical models include regulation by turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "comparing magnetized , supersonically turbulent gmcs in colliding and non - colliding cases over a wide parameter space and investigating a varied array of potential observational signatures , they found that a number of indicators suggest similarities between the colliding scenarios to observed gmcs and irdcs .",
    "further , dynamical virial analysis suggested that dense @xmath10co - defined structures created through gmc collisions were more likely to collapse and form massive star clusters when compared with more quiescently evolving structures .",
    "the next stage in evolution  and the focus of this work  is the crucial transition from collapsing clumps into star clusters .",
    "properties of the stars that form , along with their dynamical evolution shortly thereafter , may provide insight into the dominant star formation mechanisms .",
    "the goal of this study is to answer the question : do realistic models of gmc collisions create star clusters that closely match the properties of observed young star - forming regions ?",
    "we approach this question by further building upon our previous numerical framework of gmcs through the development of star formation sub - grid models , one of which is a novel magnetically - regulated model .",
    "we combine our existing gas - focused observational diagnostic methods with additional information from the population of star particles .",
    "thus , we hope to provide insight to the star formation process by analyzing the evolution of irdc - type structures into young star clusters .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] describes our numerical setup and the various star formation models .",
    "we then present our results in section [ sec : results ] , which include : gas and star cluster morphologies (  [ sec : results - morph ] ) , properties of star - forming gas (  [ sec : results - sfcells ] ) , global star formation rates ( sfrs ) and efficiencies (  [ sec : results - sfr ] ) , spatial clustering (  [ sec : results - clust ] ) , and star particle kinematics (  [ sec : results - sfppv ] ) . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss our conclusions .",
    "we further develop the numerical framework described in paper ii and introduce two star formation routines .",
    "our gmcs are identical to those initialized in paper ii , which are motivated by observed gmc properties .",
    "the clouds are self - gravitating , supersonically turbulent , and magnetized .",
    "they are initialized with identical densities and offset by an impact parameter .",
    "the clouds are embedded in an ambient medium of ten times lower density ( i.e. , an atomic cold neutral medium , cnm ) , which for the colliding case , is converging along with the gmcs .",
    "the initial simulation properties are summarized in table  [ tab : initial ] .",
    "the simulation domain is @xmath11 and contains two neighboring gmcs .",
    "the gmcs are initially uniform spheres , with hydrogen number densities of @xmath12 and radii @xmath13  pc .",
    "this gives each gmc a mass @xmath14 .",
    "the ambient gas represents the atomic cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and has a density of @xmath15 .",
    "the centers of the gmcs are offset by @xmath16 in the collision axis ( @xmath17 ) , 0 in the @xmath18-axis , and @xmath19 in the @xmath20-axis .    to approximate the density and velocity structures observed in gmcs",
    ", our clouds are initialized with a supersonic turbulent velocity field which is random , purely solenoidal , and follows the @xmath21 relation , where @xmath22 is the wavenumber for an eddy diameter @xmath23 .",
    "conventionally , the `` @xmath24-mode '' is normalized to the simulation box length .",
    "the gas within the gmc is initialized with mach number @xmath25 ( for @xmath26  k conditions ) , of order virial .",
    "we set our fiducial @xmath24-modes to be @xmath27 , where each mode within this range is excited .",
    "this is representative of the large - scale turbulent velocities ( small @xmath24 ) spanning from the gmc diameters down to a small enough minimum scale ( large @xmath24 ) , which is numerically resolved , but expected to cascade to smaller scales .",
    "we do not drive turbulence , instead letting it decay within a few dynamical times .",
    "note also that turbulence is initialized only within the initial volume of the gmcs while we leave the ambient medium non - turbulent .",
    "note also the gmc collision will also drive turbulence in the clouds in that case .    a large - scale uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath28 is initialized throughout the box at an angle @xmath29 with respect to the collision ( @xmath17- ) axis .",
    "this choice if @xmath30 is motivated by the zeeman measurements of typical gmc field strengths , summarized by @xcite .",
    "in the fiducial colliding case , the bulk flows ( including both the ambient gas and the gmcs ) have a relative velocity of @xmath31 . in the non - colliding case",
    ", there is no bulk velocity flow .",
    "the simulations are run for @xmath32 to investigate the onset of star formation .",
    "note that this is @xmath33 longer than the simulations described in paper ii , which focused on gas properties of the pre - star - forming clump .",
    "note also that the freefall time given the initial uniform density gmcs is @xmath34)^{1/2}\\simeq 4.35 $ ]  myr .",
    "however , the values of @xmath35 for the denser substructures created by turbulence and by the collision are much shorter .",
    ".initial simulation properties [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the position - velocity information , we calculate velocity gradients of the gas ( @xmath36 ) , the velocity dispersion of the gas ( @xmath37 ) , the velocity dispersion of the stars ( @xmath38 ) , the @xmath10co - weighted average velocities of the gas ( @xmath39 ) , the mass - weighted average velocities of the stars ( @xmath40 ) , and the velocity offset between the two ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : sfkinematics ] summarizes these properties for the four models as viewed from @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 lines of sight , as well as their rms values .",
    "we note that the average @xmath42 values ( 9.86 and 9.53  @xmath43 ) in the whole domain are only slightly lower than those of the primary cluster ( 9.94 and 9.83  @xmath44 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the central cluster contains the majority of the stars and thus dominates the overall distribution .    within the non - colliding cases , both the gas and stellar kinematics",
    "agree fairly closely between different star formation models .",
    "the velocity gradients are larger in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions due to asymmetries from the impact parameter .",
    "a rms value of @xmath45 is recorded .",
    "the dispersion of the gas and stars are similar in both models , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the mean velocities of the gas and stars are also similar , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the stellar velocities in the density - regulated model have slightly lower dispersions , but higher mean values .",
    "overall , the velocity offset between the gas and the stars for the non - colliding models is approximately @xmath50 .",
    "for the colliding cases , the density - regulated and magnetically - regulated star formation models exhibit similar kinematic properties of the gas and stars . on average , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "relative to non - colliding clouds , the collision induces a much larger velocity gradient ( @xmath13 - 4 times greater ) , a larger velocity dispersion in the gas ( @xmath12 times greater ) , and a much larger stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath15 times greater ) .    as functions of position ,",
    "the mean velocities of gas , stars , and their offsets , are compared .",
    "offsets exist in both non - colliding and colliding cases , becoming most apparent in close proximity to star clusters . for the non - colliding case ,",
    "these differences are relatively small , at a few @xmath44 . however , the colliding case contains regions in which the offsets exceed @xmath57",
    ". averaged over position space , colliding gmcs result in velocity offsets a factor of @xmath14 times higher than non - colliding gmcs .",
    "this parameter may be an indicator for determining the dynamical formation history of young star clusters , as results from collisions show more disturbance kinematically .",
    "we make a first , simple comparison with the results of the in - sync survey of the onc and surroundings @xcite . this survey found offsets between gas and star velocities of",
    "approximately @xmath58  km / s , but up to @xmath59 to @xmath60  km / s in some regions .",
    "the magnitude of such offsets are in general consistent with those seen in both the non - colliding and colliding models , especially considering variations associated with the particular line of sight .",
    "given that the observational data for orion is just a single example of a star - forming region , viewed on a particular sight line , it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about whether the gas and star kinematics favor one scenario over another .",
    "larger numbers of star - forming regions need to be studied with similar methods .",
    "in addition , other metrics , such as the comparison of low and high density gas tracers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , need to be examined , which on the simulation side requires extension of the astrochemical modeling to include species such as @xmath61 .",
    "we have implemented two classes of star formation sub - grid routines into the mhd code enzo that we are using to study gmc collisions : a density - regulated model based on a threshold density and a new magnetically - regulated model based on a threshold mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "varying key parameters for each star formation routine , we explored the large - scale morphology , properties of star - forming gas , global star formation rates and efficiencies over time , spatial clustering of the stars , and gas and stellar kinematics . for each model , we investigated scenarios of non - colliding and colliding gmcs .",
    "the non - colliding cases evolved in a relatively quiescent manner , driven by the initial turbulence and interplay of self - gravity and magnetic fields .",
    "star clusters formed only in the very late stages of the simulations , from overdense clumps located within filaments and dispersed throughout the gmc complex . generally , these clusters contained hundreds of solar masses each and grew at a relatively slow rate .",
    "star clusters in the density - regulated star formation routines were smaller and more isolated .",
    "the clusters formed in the magnetically - regulated models exhibited slightly more elongated morphologies . for this simulation set up , the level of star formation activity appears to be regulated by the effective density threshold that is used in each of these models , with the mass - to - flux criterion not having a large influence .    during collisions between gmcs , stars formed earlier and in larger clusters , from high - density gas produced in the primary filamentary colliding region .",
    "by @xmath62 , individual clusters have grown and merged to form one large , dominant cluster with a total stellar mass of @xmath63 . for this simulation set - up",
    ", the final overall level of star formation is relatively independent of all the explored star formation sub - grid models .",
    "star formation appears to be limited by the ability of the collision to direct mass into high density regions , which then eventually form stars with high overall efficiency .    just prior to star formation , both density and magnetically regulated star formation result in fairly similar gas properties of parent cells .",
    "however , colliding cases experience relatively wider ranges of densities , temperatures , @xmath64 , and velocity magnitude .",
    "higher mean values for density and temperature are found , while gas is more magnetically subcritical and turbulent .",
    "the primary star clusters formed in the various models were analyzed and found to have much higher surface densities at their half - mass scale than any observed cluster .",
    "we expect the future inclusion of stellar feedback will reduce these surface densities .",
    "the angular dispersion parameter ( adp ) analysis was carried out on the primary clusters in the simulations .",
    "adp values are generally greater than those see in the onc , which may indicate the onc is dynamically older than the simulated clusters .",
    "the mst @xmath65 parameter was also used to investigate the global spatial distribution properties of the star , with non - colliding cases resulting in overall highly multi - scaled clustering due to the scattered formation of independent clusters .",
    "colliding gmcs produce clusters with @xmath65 parameters that vary between those expected of multi - scale and centrally clustered distributions .",
    "kinematically , our colliding gmc cases produce velocity gradients 3 - 4 times greater than those of the non - colliding cases .",
    "the velocity dispersions also differ , with the gas in the colliding clouds having approximately twice the velocity dispersion .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions in the simulations are dominated by the potentials of the primary clusters that form , with this leading to much greater dispersions in the colliding case .",
    "we find that the colliding cases produce typically 4 times larger offsets between the mean gas and mean star velocities compared to the non - colliding case .",
    "finally , we remind the reader of several important caveats .",
    "the young stars do not inject feedback , especially protostellar outflow feedback , into the surrounding gas .",
    "internal star cluster dynamics are not well followed because of gravitational softening at the grid scale ( @xmath66  pc ) and because the star particles lack realistic mass and multiplicity distributions .",
    "still the conditions that are simulated here may provide boundary conditions for more detailed models that are able to follow full @xmath67-body evolution of the clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , in the context of gmc collisions , a wide range of cloud ( e.g. , degree of initial magnetization ) and collision ( e.g. , velocities ; impact parameters ) parameters remain to be explored with these models .",
    "these items will be addressed in subsequent papers in this series .",
    "the authors would like to thank nicola da rio and juan pablo farias for useful discussions .",
