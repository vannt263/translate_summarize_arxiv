    "gravitational wave ( gw ) is one of the robust predictions of general relativity , and expected to be detected in the next decades . since gws have few interactions with matter and radiation , they propagate almost freely after their production . therefore , analogously to the cosmic microwave background , the search for a stochastic background of gws will give us rich informations about the early universe which has not been probed by electromagnetic waves .",
    "various mechanisms to generate gw backgrounds have been proposed , such as inflation  @xcite , ( p)reheating after inflation  @xcite , cosmic strings  @xcite , and first order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to them , we propose that domain walls , which are surface like topological defects produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken , can be another source of the stochastic background of gws .",
    "the existence of domain walls is cosmologically unacceptable , since they eventually overclose the universe  @xcite .",
    "however , if domain walls are unstable and decay at a sufficiently early time  @xcite , the energy stored in them would be radiated as gws , which become the stochastic background observed today  @xcite .",
    "there are several particle physics models which predict such phenomena .",
    "for instance , the spontaneous breaking of the discrete r symmetry in the theory with supersymmetry induces domain walls which decay when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to the scale of the gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "also , the theory of axions , which was introduced in order to solve the strong cp problem of quantum chromodynamics , naturally predicts the existence of domain walls  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of the stochastic background of gws produced by domain walls can become another probe of the theory beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the stochastic background of gws of cosmological origin is expected to be isotropic , stationary and unpolarized , and therefore characterized by its frequency spectrum @xcite . in the previous study  @xcite",
    ", we calculated the spectrum of gws produced by domain walls based on the numerical simulation of the scalar field in the expanding universe .",
    "the results were straightforwardly obtained , and it was shown that gws from domain walls have a broad and nearly flat spectrum . however , in the previous work , we chose the energy scale of the symmetry breaking as an unrealistic value @xmath0gev in order to follow the domain wall evolution from the initial thermal state , and simply extrapolated the numerical result to predict the spectrum observed today .",
    "this estimation gives the large uncertainty , which can be a factor of @xmath1 in the magnitude of gws .",
    "furthermore , we put the thermal initial condition for numerical simulations , which made an additional peak at high frequencies in the gw spectrum .",
    "this might contaminate the spectrum of gws purely generated from domain walls . in order to remove these difficulties and give more accurate predictions for future observations ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate further about the spectrum of gws .    in this work ,",
    "we apply two approach to evaluate the spectrum of gws produced by domain walls .",
    "first , we perform three dimensional lattice simulation of domain walls , and calculate the gw spectrum directly from the results of the numerical simulations . this procedure is similar to that in our previous work , but we work with different setups : while we performed the calculations only for radiation dominated background in the previous work , we calculate the gw spectrum both in radiation and matter dominated backgrounds .",
    "furthermore , we do not assume the coupling with the thermal bath .",
    "in this case , the gw spectrum would represent the feature of that purely produced by domain walls . this analysis will confirm and clarify the features of the gw spectrum which we found in the previous work .",
    "second , we reevaluate the gw spectrum indirectly by using the anisotropic stress power spectrum obtained from numerical simulations . for the evaluation of the gw spectrum , we introduce the same approximations which has been used to calculate the spectrum of gws generated by first order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "this method depends on various assumptions about the source of gws , but it might become an alternative way which enables us to evaluate the gw spectrum without relying on numerical simulations with a long dynamical range .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we describe a notation to calculate gws and derive a formula which gives the spectrum of gws produced in the arbitrarily expanding background .",
    "then , we present the results of numerical simulations and discuss the features of the spectrum of gws produced by domain walls in section  [ sec3 ] . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we take another approach and reevaluate the gw spectrum .",
    "we also give forecasts for future observations based on the result of the analysis performed there .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section , we derive basic equations for gws produced in arbitrary expanding background . we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker background in which gws are represented by the spatial metric perturbation @xmath2 where @xmath3 satisfies the transverse - traceless ( tt ) condition @xmath4 . since we will investigate the generation of gws in both radiation and matter dominated background , it is convenient to consider the arbitrarily expanding background where the scale factor evolves as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is conformal time defined by @xmath7 .",
    "the metric perturbations @xmath3 obey the linearized einstein equation @xmath8 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the tt part of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "if we work in spatial fourier space and change time variable from cosmic time @xmath9 into conformal time @xmath6 , this equation gives @xmath11 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath6 .",

    "note that this is just a generalization of the green function solution obtained in @xcite for the radiation dominated background .",
    "substituting @xmath22 , one can easily check that eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) reduces to the result in the radiation dominated universe derived in @xcite .",

    "we assume that the source is statistically homogeneous and isotropic , and introduce the unequal time correlator of the anisotropic stress tensor @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes an ensemble average for a stochastic background .",
    "we note the following relations @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a mean equation of state defined by @xmath37 . by using these relations ,",

    "( [ eq2 - 9 ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 15 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 16 ] ) , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 12 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath42    where we used the approximations for @xmath43 @xmath44    and averaged over a period of the oscillation of sine and cosine with time .",
    "we define the fraction of the energy density of gws at the time @xmath9 as @xmath45 note that , it is not the value which would be observed at the present time .",
    "we introduce this notation for convenience to present the result of numerical simulations .",
    "we will convert it into the spectrum of gws observed today in section  [ sec4 - 4 ] .",

    "@xcite , the spectrum of gws was directly obtained by calculating tt pert of the stress - energy tensor @xmath10 in numerical simulations .",
    "another way to evaluate the spectrum of gws is to estimate the anisotropic stress power spectrum @xmath48 and use eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 20 ] )",
    ". we will evaluate in both ways and compare the results . the advantage of using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 20 ] ) is that we can decompose the origin of @xmath49 dependence of @xmath50 : the tilt of the spectrum is determined by the @xmath49 dependence in @xmath48 and the time integral of the green function",
    ". this decomposition might be helpful to understand the precise form of the gw spectrum , as we see in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in this section , we show the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we consider the simple model of real scalar field @xmath51 in which a discrete @xmath52 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 in the expanding background is described by the klein - gordon equation @xmath53 where the potential is given by @xmath54 this potential has @xmath52 symmetry under which the scalar field transforms as @xmath55 . this symmetry is spontaneously broken and scalar field gets vacuum expectation value @xmath56 .",
    "domain walls can be formed around the region where the value of the classical field changes from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "if such domain walls were created in the early universe and survived until today , they eventually come to overclose the energy density of the universe and disturb the success of standard cosmology  @xcite . one way to avoid this problem is to introduce a term in the potential which explicitly breaks the discrete symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of vacua  @xcite . if such a term exists , walls become unstable and eventually disappear .",
    "we model this effect by adding a term @xmath59 to the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 , which we call  bias \" , controls the magnitude of energy difference between two vacua and determines the life time of domain walls .",
    "we assume that @xmath60 is much smaller than @xmath61 since we are interested in the circumstance in which the discrete symmetry is held approximately .",
    "in particular , the condition @xmath62 must be satisfied in order that the infinite size of domain is formed  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq3 - 1 ] ) , which describes the evolution of domain walls , is highly nonlinear and difficult to solve analytically",
    ". then we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq3 - 1 ] ) numerically on the three dimensional lattice . in the previous study  @xcite , scalar field",
    "is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath63 , and the initial field configurations are generated by considering finite temperature effects . in this primary thermal stage , the scalar field fluctuations also produce gws with the spectrum peaked at the frequency corresponding to the mass of the scalar field @xmath64",
    ". however , this setup might be irrelevant to our interest to calculate gw spectrum produced by domain walls .",
    "the reason is as follows : the amplitude of gws becomes large enough to observe if domain walls survived for sufficiently long time .",
    "this means that the spectrum of gws produced at the primary stage is negligible compared with that produced by domain walls at the late time .",
    "furthermore , the assumption that the phase transition occurred at @xmath65 gives a severe constraint on the range of parameters which we choose to perform realistic simulations .",
    "in numerical simulations , we must resolve the width of the wall @xmath66 and keep hubble radius @xmath67 smaller than the size of the simulation box .",
    "if we assume that the temperature is given by @xmath65 , the ratio of these two length scale is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the planck mass . therefore , we must choose @xmath70 close to the planck scale in order to maintain the resolution of the width of domain walls . in numerical simulations performed in  @xcite",
    ", the value of @xmath70 is chosen to be @xmath71gev , and the results of the simulations are extrapolated into lower values of @xmath70 . however , it is not obvious that this extrapolation is held for arbitrary scale of @xmath70 .    to avoid these difficulties",
    ", we omit the assumption of thermal initial conditions and give the initial field configurations as gaussian random amplitudes . in this case",
    ", we expect that only domain walls contribute as a source of gws .",
    "in addition , if we normalize all the dimensionful quantities in the unit of @xmath70 , the results of numerical simulations become independent of @xmath70 .",
    "see appendix [ seca-1 ] for more details of the setup of the simulations .",
    "now , we present the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we performed lattice simulations with @xmath72 points in both radiation and matter dominated backgrounds .",
    "the comoving size of the simulation box is set to be 50 ( in the radiation dominated era ) or 24 ( in the matter dominated era ) in the unit of @xmath73 .",
    "we fix @xmath74 and vary the value of @xmath60 . the initial time",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the area occupied by domain walls in the simulation box .",
    "we see that , if @xmath78 , the area density of domain walls decays at late time .",
    "it means that domain walls collapse due to the existence of the bias . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath79 , the comoving area density of domain walls evolves as @xmath80 .",
    "this property is called the scaling solution  @xcite and corresponds to the fact that the energy density of domain walls evolves like @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the surface mass density of the domain wall .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the energy density of the scalar field . from this figure",

    "this is due to the fact that we can not resolve the width of domain walls for a long time in the comoving box if we take account of the cosmic expansion . in particular ,",
    "the actual dynamical range in the simulation with matter dominated background is as small as @xmath86 in conformal time , where @xmath87 is the time when domain walls enter the scaling regime .",

    "let us define comoving wavenumbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 which correspond to the hubble radius and the width of domain walls , respectively , @xmath96 note that the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 vary with time .",
    "in the present numerical simulations where all of the dimensionful quantities are normalized in the unit of @xmath70 , @xmath94 changes from @xmath97 at the initial time to @xmath98 at the final time in the simulation with radiation dominated background , and it changes from @xmath99 to @xmath100 in the simulation with matter dominated background .",
    "also , @xmath95 changes from @xmath101 to @xmath102 in the simulation with radiation dominated background , and it changes from @xmath101 to @xmath103 in the simulation with matter dominated background .",
    "therefore , these two scales become separate at the late time of simulations . in fact",
    ", we see that the band of the spectra shown in figure  [ fig3 ] becomes wider as time passes .    in our previous study  @xcite , the spectrum of gws",
    "had a peak at the high frequency ( around @xmath104 ) , and the slope of the spectrum was mildly blue tilted .",
    "however , in the present results , the spectrum with @xmath79 becomes slightly red tilted as we see in figures  [ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "this difference might be caused by the fact that we use different initial conditions for numerical simulations : the spectrum obtained in  @xcite contains the gws produced during the primary thermal stage ( see section  [ sec3 - 1 ] ) , which is not completely negligible in the time scale of the simulations and gives a peak at the high frequency .",
    "therefore , we expect that if gws from primary thermal stage become negligible and the source of gws is purely domain walls , the spectrum of gws is almost flat and slightly red tilted",
    ". then , if domain walls collapse , the amplitude of gws grows at the high frequency as we see in figures  [ fig3 ] ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "this corresponds the fact that the false vacuum regions become small when domain walls decay .    to summarize",
    ", the spectrum of gws obtained by direct numerical calculations indicates that the shape of the spectrum is nearly flat ( or slightly red tilted ) and the slope of the spectrum seems to change at two characteristic frequencies corresponding to the hubble radius at the decay of domain walls and the width of domain walls .",

    "however , these results have many numerical uncertainties especially in the high and low frequency bands of the spectrum , because of the lack of the spatial resolution in the lattice simulation . in order to remove this difficulty , we take another approach to evaluate the spectrum of gws and discuss further about the shape of the spectrum of gws .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we derived eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 20 ] ) , which indicates that we can evaluate the gw spectrum if we know the anisotropic stress power spectrum @xmath48 .",
