    "the mechanism of the phase transition in magnetite ( fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ) at @xmath5 k , discovered by verwey @xcite , has remained a big puzzle in the condensed matter physics for almost 70 years .",
    "developments in experimental and theoretical methods during last years enabled to reveal subtle changes in the crystal and electronic structure below @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a simple charge ordering picture in which metal - insulator transition is induced by electrostatic interactions was replaced by a highly complex scenario in which lattice , charge , spin and orbital degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "recent theoretical studies revealed the important role of the local electron interactions and orbital correlations in the @xmath7 states on iron ions @xcite .",
    "o@xmath4 ( solid lines ) compared with the experimental points taken from ref .",
    "the order parameters @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are marked by circles.,width=291 ]    the electronic interactions are complemented by the lattice deformation , which breaks the cubic symmetry and induces a low - temperature ( lt ) monoclinic phase driven by the electron - phonon interactions @xcite . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have obtained the phonon spectrum of magnetite ( fig .",
    "1 ) using the _ ab initio _ computational technique @xcite .",
    "we have identified two primary order parameters ( ops ) at @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the @xmath0 and @xmath8 symmetry , respectively , which both play important role in the vt : ( @xmath12 ) the @xmath8 mode is responsible for the doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath13 direction in the monoclinic phase , while ( @xmath14 ) the @xmath0 phonon induces the metal - insulator transition by its coupling to the electronic states near the fermi energy @xcite . due to the electron - phonon interaction",
    "the above ops are combinations of the electron ( charge - orbital ) and lattice components .",
    "this explains why the phonon soft mode has not been observed . instead",
    ", low - energy critical fluctuations of ops were found by the diffuse neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the condensation of the ops below @xmath6 explains the crystal symmetry change as well as the charge - orbital ordering .",
    "the group theory predicts also secondary ops , which do not effect the symmetry below @xmath6 but modify the properties of magnetite close to a transition point . at the @xmath15 point",
    ", the @xmath9 mode can be classified as the secondary op , and its coupling to the shear strain explains the softening of the @xmath2 elastic constant @xcite . the lowest @xmath9 optic mode , marked in fig .",
    "1 , could contribute quantitatively to the free energy , but it does not play any significant role for the vt .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce and analyze the landau free energy for the vt , and discuss a solution corresponding to the lt monoclinic phase .",
    "we derive also the temperature dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "the landau free energy can be expanded into a series of the components of the ops .",
    "the invariant terms describing couplings between the ops were derived using the group theory methods @xcite .",
    "the only nonzero components of the primary ops @xmath0 and @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we include also the secondary op with the @xmath9 symmetry ( @xmath18 ) and shear - strain ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the free energy can be written in the form @xcite @xmath20 were @xmath21 is the part of the potential , which does not change through the transition .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 to ensure the stability of the potential at high temperatures .",
    "for the second - order terms we assume standard temperature behavior @xmath25 near the critical temperature @xmath26 for @xmath27 , which would correspond to a continuous phase transition .",
    "the coefficient @xmath28 is the shear elastic constant at high temperatures ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the coupling between the primary ops is biquadratic , between the secondary and primary ops has the linear - quadratic form , and the coupling between the components of the secondary op is of the bilinear type .",
    "taking first derivatives of @xmath30 over all ops we get @xmath31 the solution @xmath32 corresponds to the high - temperature cubic symmetry ( @xmath33 ) . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) we obtain the dependence between @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath34 which has three possible solutions : ( @xmath12 ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 if @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , ( @xmath14 ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 and @xmath42 or @xmath37 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . in the brackets we put the space group symbols , which characterize the low - symmetry phases .",
    "the solution ( @xmath44 ) which corresponds to the experimentally observed lt monoclinic phase requires simultaneous condensation of both primary ops .",
    "the necessary condition for this is a negative value of @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , it has been established by the _ ab initio _ studies that the total energy is lowered when the crystal is distorted by both @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes @xcite . for @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ qg ] ) has a non - zero solution provided that @xmath50 .",
    "it implies that for @xmath41 ( @xmath51 ) , the phase transition occurs when the op @xmath16 exceeds a critical value @xmath52 , so it has a discontinuous ( first - order ) character .    from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we get @xmath53 which shows that @xmath54 and @xmath55 only if @xmath56 . eliminating @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 using eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , the potential @xmath30 can be written as a function of @xmath16 @xmath57 where the renormalized coefficients are @xmath58 the zero - order and second - order terms depend on the parameters belonging to the primary ops .",
    "the secondary ops modify only the forth - order term . in this notation , the solution of eqs .",
    "( 2)-(5 ) , which minimizes the potential @xmath30 reads @xmath59    to study the softening of @xmath2 , we have eliminated @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) , and expressed the free energy as a function of @xmath19 only . in these calculations",
    "we have omitted the sixth - order term , which usually has a small contribution near the transition point .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath2 is obtained using the standard definition @xmath60 where @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the second and third term in eq . ( [ c44 ] ) are negative at high temperatures , so both contribute to the softening of @xmath2 .",
    "it means that all couplings included in eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) are involved in this behavior .",
    "the main temperature dependence is caused by the second term , but also the last term in eq .",
    "( [ c44 ] ) may depend on temperature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the softening of @xmath2 was explained taking into account only the bilinear coupling ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "indeed , if we assume that @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ c44 ] ) reduces to that found in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath65 . omitting the last term , eq .",
    "( [ c44 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 . since , eq .",
    "( [ ct ] ) has the same form as that one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fitting procedure will give the following values of parameters : @xmath68 k and @xmath69 k. note that the meaning of both temperatures @xmath70 and @xmath71 is here different than in ref .",
    "@xcite as they include all interactions .",
    "the softening is not complete ( only about 10 % ) since the first - order phase transition and the change of structure occurs at much higher temperature than @xmath70 .",
    "the present work shows that the vt can be analyzed using the landau theory of phase transitions .",
    "it provides a basis to study the interplay between the ops and the mechanism of phase transition with two or more ops .",
    "moreover , majority of experimental facts can be understood in one coherent picture .",
    "we emphasize that the coupling between the modes with the @xmath0 and @xmath8 symmetry plays the crucial role in the vt in magnetite and explains both the occurrence of the lt monoclinic phase and the metal - insulator transition .",
    "this results in rather complex structure of the charge and orbital ordering , with two different charge modulations characterized by @xmath72 and @xmath73 wave vectors found in diffraction studies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have discussed the conditions , which have to be fulfilled for both ops to develop simultaneously .",
    "it depends primarily on the coupling coefficient @xmath48 , which should be negative below @xmath6 and large enough to stabilize both ops .",
    "our present analysis extends also the previous studies of the temperature dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "so far , the softening of @xmath2 was studied in the models restricted to the @xmath15 point @xcite .",
    "since the phase transition is driven mainly by the ops at @xmath74 , the ops at the zone center develop solely due to their coupling to other modes .",
    "therefore , the bilinear coupling at the @xmath15 point is rather a side effect of the phase transition , not the main origin of it .",
    "the present study shows that also a direct coupling between the @xmath0 primary op and the shear strain ( @xmath75 ) influences the @xmath2 elastic constant , providing an alternative mechanism of its softening .",
