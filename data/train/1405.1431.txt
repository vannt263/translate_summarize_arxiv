    "early - type galaxies play an important role in observational studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "tight empirical correlations between the observed dynamical and stellar population properties of early - type galaxies have been derived that set useful constraints to their formation histories .",
    "these are correlations between size ( effective radius , ) , surface brightness and stellar velocity dispersion ( ) , i.e. , the fundamental plane ( fp , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the stellar mass plane @xcite , the fundamental manifold of galaxies @xcite , as well as correlations between galaxy color and stellar population age and metal abundance with galaxy mass ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "such scaling relations represent a powerful phenomenological tool to study the co - evolution of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies .",
    "the latter has been studied extensively for the local galaxy population .",
    "the tightness of the fp has been used to constrain stellar population variations or dark matter content in galaxies @xcite or to study non - homology @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamical properties and dark halo scaling relations of giant elliptical galaxies , and found that the tilt of the fp is best explained by a stellar population effect and not by an increasing dark matter fraction with luminosity .",
    "@xcite , using data from the sauron survey @xcite , suggested that dynamical to stellar mass - to - light ratios larger than one are due to dark matter , assuming a constant stellar initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite and using self - consistent models ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "other studies based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) data came to the conclusions that there is an excess over the predictions of stellar population models with a fixed imf which are luminosity dependent @xcite .",
    "these conclusions have recently been revised in @xcite by means of a large number of axysimmetric dynamical models including different representations of dark matter halos reporting a variation of imf slope with galaxy mass .",
    "in fact , as highlighted by @xcite , for instance , dark matter fraction and imf are highly degenerate .",
    "they studied a sample of coma galaxies and their detailed decomposition into luminous and dark matter reveals that for low - mass galaxies there is a good agreement between dynamical masses with dark matter halo and lensing results ( galaxies with a @xmath7  are consistent with a kroupa imf ) . for higher - mass galaxies ( @xmath8 )",
    ", the disagreement can be due to either a non constant imf ( kroupa imf under - predicts luminous dynamical masses for galaxies at @xmath9 ) or to a dark matter component which follows the light ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a promising complementary approach to detailed studies of local galaxies for breaking the degeneracy between dark matter fraction and imf is to study the evolution of fundamental plane , dynamical and stellar population properties of galaxies with look - back time @xcite .",
    "moreover , dark matter fractions can also be studied in samples of lensed galaxies at different redshifts ( see @xcite using data from both the sloan lens acs sample , slacs , @xcite , @xcite , and the boss emission line lens survey , bells , @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of such investigations have been performed in recent years , analyzing the redshift evolution of galaxy sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the bottom line is that galaxy sizes appear to decrease ( at fixed stellar mass ) and stellar velocity dispersions increase ( at fixed stellar mass ) with increasing look - back time .",
    "some of these conclusions are still controversial , however .",
    "@xcite , for example , argue that the size evolution disappears when one homogenizes literature data sets by measuring the stellar mass with the same method and provides accurate estimates of the sizes to prevent systematic effects in the  measurements of low @xmath10 high - z compact galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite also report evidence for galaxies as large as local ones at redshift higher than 1.4 suggesting that not all high-@xmath11 galaxies are compact . moreover , the effect depends on the photometric band and on whether galaxies have young or old light - weighted ages and if they reside in clusters or field ( see @xcite for clusters and @xcite for field studies ; see also @xcite for a different opinion ) .",
    "so far , galaxies in the distant universe ( look - back times of a few billion years and above ) have not been studied at the same statistical level as local galaxies .",
    "the new data set from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , @xcite ) as part of the sloan digital sky survey - iii ( sdssiii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the opportunity to investigate the dynamical and stellar population properties of a galaxy sample of unprecedented size up to redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "the survey is currently obtaining spectroscopic data for nearly 1.5 million massive galaxies at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.7 , hence up to look - back times of @xmath13gyr . the combination of this sample with local early - type galaxies from sdss - i / ii allows us to make a statistically significant link between local galaxy properties and higher redshift observations .",

    "boss galaxy targets are selected from the sdss _ ugriz _ imaging @xcite , including new imaging part of dr8 mapping the southern galactic hemisphere .",

    "the selection criteria are designed to identify a sample of luminous and massive galaxies with an approximately uniform distribution of stellar masses following the luminous red galaxy ( lrg , @xcite ) models of @xcite .",
    "the galaxy sample is composed of two populations : the higher redshift constant mass sample ( cmass , @xmath19 ) and the low - redshift sample ( lowz , @xmath20 ) . a fraction ( around 1/3 ) of those lowz galaxies derived with those cuts",
    "have been already observed in sdss - i / ii and are included in the boss sample , but they are not re - observed if they had reliable redshifts .",
    "these two population are well separated in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 colors diagram @xcite .    to extract a working set of objects from the entire boss sample we matched galaxies from different catalogs of stellar velocity dispersions and stellar masses described in the following sections using the keywords plate , mjd , fiberid that uniquely determine a single observation of a single object .",
    "the final merged catalog comprises @xmath23 galaxies that are included in dr9 .",
    "we selected objects from the lowz and cmass samples ( boss_target1 = target flags ) with a good platequality ( platequality=good ) , with object class galaxy ( class_noqso = galaxy ) , with high - confidence redshifts ( zwarning_nqso=0 ) , and for which we have a unique set of objects in the case of duplicate observations ( specprimary=1 ) .    the final sample we will analyze comprises @xmath24 objects ( 37% of the original sample ) obtained after applying some additional redshift cuts and quality cuts to stellar velocity dispersions and stellar masses that we will discuss in section  [ sec : galaxy_properties ] .",
    "in order to connect our boss galaxies to the local galaxy population , we use a sample of galaxies from the sdss data release seventh ( dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we select early - types galaxies following @xcite . galaxies had to be well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile in the @xmath25 and @xmath26-bands ( fracdev_g=1 fracdev_r=1 ) , with an early - type like spectrum ( eclass @xmath27 0 ) , extinction - corrected @xmath26-band de vaucouleurs magnitudes in the range @xmath28devmag_r@xmath29 ( this results in a tighter limit compared to that of the sdss main galaxy sample , see details in @xcite ) , measured stellar velocity dispersion in dr7 veldisp @xmath30 , and with an axis ratio in @xmath26-band of @xmath31 , to be more likely pressure supported . as described in @xcite the dr7 @xmath32 distribution shows two distinct populations separated by this axis - ratio value with a 20% of low - luminosity objects at @xmath33 . from the sdss imaging could be highly unreliable .",
    "in fact , we do not find the same clear separation in the @xmath32 distribution of boss galaxies . also , the boss @xmath32 distribution looks different probably due to the large uncertainties on @xmath32 from sdss imaging .",
    "however , we assess the typical percentage of galaxies which should have a @xmath33 by using the sub - sample of boss galaxies with cosmos photometry ( see section  [ subsec : size_cosmos ] for details ) and find that @xmath34% of galaxies have a @xmath33 , which is consistent with @xcite findings . finally , the choice of this cut does not affect appreciably our results . ]",

    "the primary aim of this work is to study the redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of boss galaxies .",
    "stellar masses are taken from @xcite and stellar velocity dispersions from @xcite . both of these quantities",
    "are included in the dr9 data release .",
    "we used a sub - sample of 240 galaxies with additional hst / cosmos photometry and boss spectra @xcite to derive a calibration for galaxy sizes from dr8 . in the following sections we describe the galaxy parameters in more detail . in section  [ subsec : galaxy_mass ] we describe how the effective radii and stellar velocity dispersion are combined to derive virial masses .",

    "boss galaxies are often not well resolved in sdss imaging .",
    "the average seeing of the sdss survey is 105 from the psf_fwhm in the @xmath50-band ( lower and upper percentile of 088 to 124 ) , which is better than in previous data releases due to the repeated images taken during the survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the median effective radius of boss galaxies ( after having applied the previous cuts on the sample ) is 124 ( upper and lower percentile 212 and 072 , respectively ) . as a consequence ,",
    "seeing effects will affect size measurements ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which we need to correct for . to develop a seeing correction we compare sdss galaxy radii with measurements based on high - resolution hst / cosmos imaging ( section  [ subsec : size_calibration ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness models used by pipeline to obtain galaxy sizes are relatively simple ( single parameter fits , i.e. exponential or de vaucouleurs profiles ) ; a more complex model is not feasible for this analysis because of the limitation of the image resolution .",
    "we tested this conclusion and found that performing srsic fits on boss images yields strong degeneracies between effective radius and srsic index , preventing robust estimate of effective radii .",
    "we estimate sdss circularized radii as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the semi - major axis of the half - light ellipse and @xmath56 is the axis ratio which is part of the dr8 catalog .    the effective radii should , in principle , be referred to a fixed rest - frame wavelength to account for the fact that early - types have color gradients , so on average their optical radii are larger in bluer bands and at higher @xmath11 this effect will make the sizes larger ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussions ) .",
    "we did not apply any correction for this trend , because uncertainties of the size calibration ( @xmath57 10 - 25% ) are larger than the typical variation in size measured in different filters ( from 4% to 10% , @xcite , @xcite ) . in section  [ subsec : mass_size ]",

    "we use a different parametrization than in section  [ subsec : size_sdss ] because we have additional information from the srsic fit ( the two parametrization would give consistent results for a wide range of @xmath73 ) .    we did not apply any correction to account for the fact that rest - frame wavelengths are different at different redshifts using only @xmath50-band data because this sample is only used for calibration purposes , and uncertainties due to the size calibration we derive using cosmos radii are much larger than the wavelength variation at the redshifts considered ( see section  [ subsec : size_sdss ] ) . moreover cosmos has just one filter available for those galaxies .",
    "cosmos radii were converted to kpc in the same way as sdss radii using the code of @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will use the notation _",
    "cosmos @xmath74 _ to represent cosmos effective radii in kpc .",
    "a significant fraction ( 23 % ) of boss galaxies with hst imaging are unresolved multiple systems in sdss imaging @xcite . to derive an accurate calibration we excluded these unresolved multiple systems from our analysis ( 44 galaxies ) using the public catalog of @xcite.mastersk / bossmorphologies/ ] the redshift range we wish to study is @xmath75 , and we discarded 4 additional galaxies at higher redshifts and 13 at @xmath44 .",
    "this leaves us a sample of 163 galaxies .",
    "cosmos redshifts are adopted , as not all of these objects ( 158 out of 163 ) have boss redshifts ( this will not change our results , because the median difference between cosmos and boss redshifts is negligible , 7.21@xmath76 ) .",
    "we do not correct for psf variations in the sdss imaging , because the psf is reasonably stable and the effect is negligible compared to the overall correction derived here .",

    "@xcite found that a single offset was reproducing their data in which they compared the ratio sdss over cosmos radii as a function of cosmos radii . in this work",
    "we compare the ratio of sdss over cosmos radii as a function of sdss radii to derive a correction for the full boss sample .",
    "as is to be expected , there is also some redshift dependence , in the sense that sdss radii overestimate most the true radii at higher redshifts .",
    "also , as expected , the scatter of the relationships increases with redshift owing to the decrease in sdss imaging quality .",
    "the size calibration could be affected by the larger uncertainties in the sdss effective radii due to the higher than typical sky background ( @xmath47 60 - 70% ) of sdss images in the cosmos field @xcite ( on the other side seeing is smaller than typical of 10 - 15% ) which could give relations between sdss and cosmos radii not universal for the full boss sample .",
    "we performed fits to these relationships in the four redshift bins independently .",
    "we tested for linear correlations applying different levels of sigma clipping in the linear fits : no sigma clipping , red line in figure  [ fig : sdss_re_cosmos_re_vs_sdss ] ; just one @xmath78 clipping green line in figure  [ fig : sdss_re_cosmos_re_vs_sdss ] ; and an iterative @xmath78 clipping blue line in figure  [ fig : sdss_re_cosmos_re_vs_sdss ] with a maximum of three iterations .",

    "the least - square fits were performed using the mpfit algorithm @xcite under the idl environment . fits with and without sigma clipping are consistent within the errors .",
    "the slope of the relation increases slightly with redshift as to be expected .",
    "the scatter about the relation is comparable in the first three redshift bins , while the last redshift bin shows a considerably higher scatter ( see table  [ tab : sizecorr ] , @xmath81 ) .",
    "for this reason , we will only use the first three redshift bins in the analysis .",
    "we tested the significance of the fits through an f - test by comparing the resulting @xmath82 values for free and fixed slope fits accounting for the number of degrees of freedom , and find a maximum probability of no relation to be @xmath572 % , which confirms the statistical validity of our fits .",
    "the final fits we adopt for the radius correction in each redshift bin are the linear fits with iterative @xmath78 clipping ( blue lines ) because they give corrections with a smaller scatter compared to other fits ( of 6 - 30% ) .",
    "the open squares in figure  [ fig : sdss_re_cosmos_re_vs_sdss ] are those galaxies that were discarded in the sigma clipping .",
    "open stars represent unresolved multiple systems not considered in the fits .",
    "we additionally searched for correlations of the effective radius with several other dr8 structural parameters like axis ratio b / a , fracdev , and the difference between fiber2mag and modelmag with the aim at finding the best parameter space for the radius correction .",
    "none of these parameters helped improving the radius correction .",
    "the size correction we derive here accounts also for the fact that galaxies in our sample could have been better described by a srsic profile rather than a de vaucouleurs , therefore we should consider our calibrated sizes as `` srsic - like '' ."
