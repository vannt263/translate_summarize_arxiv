    "recently both atlas and cms collaboration announced that there are some excess around 750 gev in the diphoton channel  @xcite : @xmath17 the best fit value of the total width of the excess from atlas is @xcite @xmath18 while the cms data prefers smaller value  @xcite @xmath19 this excess motivated a lot of phenomenological study on possible scenario of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , in particular , by introducing a composite particle of new quarks which feel qcd or qcd - like interactions  @xcite . in this paper , we discuss a possibility that this excess is due to new confining strong interaction ( which we call hypercolor interaction , or h - qcd in short ) and new particles that feels not only this new strong force but also the sm gauge interactions .",

    "depending on the mass of the h - glueball , the lightest @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) bound state which is responsible for the 750 gev diphoton excess may not decay into two h - glueballs . in this work , we consider both cases where the decay into h - glueballs are open or forbidden kinematically .",

    "one of the key questions is which one of @xmath10 or @xmath25 does explain the 750 gev diphoton excess .",
    "this can be answered by noting that the @xmath13 quantum numbers of two states are different , namely @xmath159 vs. @xmath160 .",
    "hence the polarizations of two photons in the final states should be orthogonal vs. parallel .",
    "similar issue has been studied for the 125 gev higgs to determine its @xmath13 quantum numbers .",
    "for example , one can study the azimuthal angle distribution of the forward dijet in @xmath161 .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath162 channel can be confirmed in near future , one may study the @xmath13 quantum numbers of the scalar resonance via the angular distribution of decay products of the two @xmath163 bosons .",
