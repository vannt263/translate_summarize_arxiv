    "the study of the lowest  lying hadron resonances dynamics has received a lot of attention in the last decades , in particular since it was realized that some of them can not be easily accommodated as radial or angular excitations of the constituent quark model ( cqm ) ground states .",
    "some examples are the low - lying scalar @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , or axial vector @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 mesons .",
    "the field has experimented a considerable boost in the last five years , because several clear candidates for exotic states can be found among the recently discovered hidden bottom and charm @xmath20 resonances reported by the belle , babar , @xmath21 and cdf collaborations @xmath22 and @xmath23 resonances ( which are located just a few mev above the @xmath24 and @xmath25 thresholds , respectively  @xcite ) or the @xmath26 isoscalar hidden charm state @xmath27 placed close to the @xmath28 threshold  @xcite . ] .",
    "there has been a steady activity in the context of cqm s aiming to supplement these models with exotic components due to existence of tetraquark degrees of freedom inside of the hadrons ( see for instance the discussion in ref .",
    "such components might lead to extended cqm schemes where the known exotic resonances could be generated and their main features be described . here , however , we will pay attention to a different approach , in which the hadron resonances appear as bound or resonant states of an interacting pair of ground state hadrons ( mesons of the @xmath1 octet and the @xmath2 nonet and baryons of the @xmath29 octet and @xmath30 decuplet , when the study is limited to the three lightest quark flavors ) . in this molecular picture ,",
    "hadron resonances show up as poles in the first or second riemann sheets ( frs / srs ) of certain hadron ",
    "hadron amplitudes .",
    "the positions of the poles determine masses and widths of the resonances , while the residues for the different channels define the corresponding coupling or branching fractions .",
    "the interaction among the ground state hadrons is thus the first ingredient to build this molecular scheme .",
    "these are usually obtained from effective field theories ( eft s ) that incorporate constrains deduced from some relevant exact or approximate symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this context , it is clear that chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite and heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss )  @xcite should play relevant roles , when designing interactions involving goldstone bosons or charm / bottom hadrons , respectively . in this work , we will focus in the light su(3 ) flavor sector and we will leave the extension of this discussion to heavy molecules for future research .",
    "chpt is a systematic implementation of chiral symmetry and of its pattern of spontaneous and explicit breaking , and it provides a model independent scheme where a large number of low - energy non - perturbative strong - interaction phenomena can be understood .",
    "it has been successfully applied to study different processes involving light ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) or strange ( @xmath33 ) quarks . because chpt provides the scattering amplitudes as a perturbative series , it can not describe non - analytical features as poles .",
    "thus , chpt can not directly describe the nature of hadron resonances .",
    "in recent years , it has been shown that by unitarizing the chpt amplitudes in coupled channels , the region of application of chpt can be greatly extended .",
    "this approach , commonly referred as unitary chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt ) , has received much attention and provided many interesting results , in particular in the meson - meson sector where we will concentrate our attention in this work ,  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that many meson - meson resonances and bound states appear naturally within uchpt .",
    "these states are then interpreted as having `` dynamical nature . '' in other words , they are not genuine @xmath34 states , but are mainly built out of their meson - meson components . to distinguish among these two pictures , it has been suggested to follow the dependence on a variable number of colors @xmath35 of the resonance properties by assuming that hadronic properties scale similarly as if @xmath36 was large . some interesting results are being obtained from this perspective  @xcite , and at present there exists some controversy on the nature of the @xmath11 resonance  @xcite for which accurate models are available .",
    "the present work is an update of ref .",
    "@xcite , where was derived a spin - flavor extension of chiral symmetry to study the @xmath0-wave meson - meson interaction involving members not only of the @xmath1-octet , but also of the @xmath2-nonet .",
    "the similar approach for baryon - meson dynamics was initiated in @xcite .",
    "elastic unitarity in coupled channels is restored in @xcite by solving a renormalized coupled - channel bethe ",
    "salpeter equation ( bse ) with an interaction kernel deduced from spin - flavor extensions of the chpt amplitudes . in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin - flavor symmetry was explicitly broken to account for physical masses and decay constants of the involved mesons , and also when the amplitudes were renormalized .",
    "nevertheless , the underlying su(6 ) symmetry was still present and served to organize the set of even parity meson resonances found in that work .",
    "indeed , it was shown that most of the low - lying even parity pdg ( particle data group collaboration  @xcite ) meson resonances , specially in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 sectors , could be classified according to multiplets of the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry group .",
    "however , some resonances , like the isoscalar @xmath39 or @xmath40 states , could not be accommodated within this scheme and it was claimed that these states could be clear candidates to be glueballs or hybrids  @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry ( cs ) , and its breaking pattern , is encoded in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite at leading order ( lo ) by means of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) soft pion theorem  @xcite .",
    "this cs input strongly constraints the pseudoscalar  pseudoscalar ( @xmath41 ) and pseudoscalar  vector ( @xmath42 ) channels , since the mesons of the pion octet were identified with the set of nambu - goldstone bosons that appear for three flavors ( due to the spontaneous breaking of cs ) .",
    "thus , the main features ( masses , widths , branching fractions and couplings ) of the lowest nonet of @xmath0-wave scalar resonances ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) found in ref .",
    "@xcite do not significantly differ from those obtained in previous su(3 ) uchpt approaches  @xcite .",
    "this is because these resonances are generated from the interaction of nambu - goldstone bosons , and the influence of the vector  vector ( @xmath43 ) components in these states is small .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 sectors have been also systematically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these works adopt the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons  @xcite . in the @xmath44-exchange contributions",
    "@xcite and considering only the propagation of the time component of the virtual vector mesons . ] in the @xmath45 sector , as mentioned above , cs constrains the interactions , and the interactions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and those used in ref .",
    "@xcite totally agree at lo in the chiral expansion , despite their different apparent structure and origin .",
    "as a consequence , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are in general in good agreement with those previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which among others include the prediction of a two pole structure for the @xmath19 resonance  @xcite . however , the simultaneous consideration of @xmath42 and @xmath43 channels made the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite different from that followed in ref .",
    "@xcite in few cases .",
    "one of the most remarkable cases was that of the @xmath46 resonance , which was dynamically generated for the first time in the work of ref .",
    "the interference @xmath47 amplitudes turned out to play a crucial role in producing this state in @xcite , and that is presumably the reason why the @xmath48 resonance was generated neither in the @xmath45 study of @xcite , nor in the @xmath49 scheme of ref .",
    "possibly , the situation is similar for the @xmath50 state .",
    "these two resonances helped to envisage a clearer su(6 ) pattern in  @xcite , which is also followed to some extent in nature , and that is missed in the separate works of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .    in general terms , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite provides a fairly good description of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sectors .",
    "however , from a phenomenological point of view , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite led to a much poorer description of the @xmath51 sector , which for @xmath0-wave is constructed out of @xmath43 interactions .",
    "indeed , the well established @xmath8 and @xmath10 resonances are difficult to accommodate in the scheme , which needs to be somehow pushed to its limits of validity .",
    "the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons model used in  @xcite seems to be more successful in describing the properties of the @xmath8 and @xmath10 resonances . this latter model and that of ref .",
    "@xcite are related for @xmath45 scattering , thanks to cs , but they are completely unrelated in the @xmath43 sector .    the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry is severely broken in nature . certainly it is mandatory to take into account mass breaking effects by using different pseudoscalar and vector mesons masses .",
    "however , this can not be done by just using these masses in the kinematics of the amplitudes derived in a straight su(6 ) extension of the wt lagrangian , since this would lead to flagrant violations of the soft pion theorems in the @xmath45 sector due to the large vector meson masses . instead in  @xcite",
    ", a proper mass term was added to the extended wt lagrangian that produced different pseudoscalar and vector meson masses , _ while preserving , or softly breaking , chiral symmetry_. such term , besides providing masses to the vector mesons , gives rise to further contact interaction terms ( local ) . however ,",
    "some other local interaction su(6 ) symmetry breaking terms respecting ( softly breaking ) cs can be designed , as we show in this work . the nature of the contact terms can only be fully unraveled by requiring consistency with the qcd asymptotic behavior at high energies  @xcite , which is far from being trivial . as an alternative",
    ", we will present here a phenomenological analysis of the effects on the resonance spectrum due to the inclusion of new vv interactions consistent with cs .",
    "thus , in first place , we will find in this work the most general four meson - field local ( involving no derivatives ) terms consistent with the chiral symmetry breaking pattern of qcd , and constructed by using a single trace , in the spirit of the large @xmath36 expansion .",
    "next , we will show that the inclusion of these pieces leads to a considerable improvement of the description of @xmath3 sector , without spoiling the main features of the predictions obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath52 and @xmath5 sectors .",

    "@xcite , the following mass term , which replaces that in eq .",

    ", we will compare the spectrum of resonances obtained from the pole structure of the renormalized bse @xmath141-matrix in the frs and srs with the main properties of the meson states listed in the pdg  @xcite .",
    "to better isolate the effects of @xmath198 , we will frequently refer also to the previous results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the main obstacle to carry out",
    "the above program is the enormous freedom that a priori exists for fixing the subtraction constants .",
    "this is not only true for the present model , all schemes that restore unitarity suffer from the same problem  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this freedom should be traced back to the renormalization procedure needed to render finite the unitarized amplitudes , that always involve a non - perturbative re - summation .",
    "since all meson - meson theories are effective , their renormalization inescapably requires the introduction of new and undetermined low energy constants ( rlecs ) . for the interaction of goldstone bosons ,",
    "these rlecs can be related to the low energy constants that appear in the higher order lagrangian terms of the systematic chiral expansion  @xcite , and in some cases , they might be constrained with other physical observables .",
    "however , no such systematic expansion exists when the involved bosons are vectors , and consequently , their related rlecs remain to a large extent unconstrained .",
    "often , the unknown rlecs are tuned to best reproduce the physical properties of the resonances generated by the non - perturbative unitary re - summation .    in the renormalization scheme followed in @xcite ,",
    "the rlecs are encoded by the subtraction constants @xmath129 that appear in the expression of the renormalized loop function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs ] ) .",
    "there is one such constant for each @xmath197 sector and for each channel of the associated coupled channels space .",
    "the @xmath129 are free parameters prior to supplementing more detailed information from qcd .",
    "as said , the situation is similar in the rest of the approaches applied to the study of vector mesons .",
    "a practical solution to the impasse is found in the literature  @xcite , namely , for @xmath130 , the various @xmath129 are fixed to values around @xmath199 .",
    "the @xmath129 s are let to vary around the value @xmath199 to best describe the known phenomenology in each @xmath197 sector .",
    "this default value of @xmath199 is suggested from analysis where an ultraviolet ( uv ) hard cutoff @xmath200 is used to renormalize the loop function , instead of dimensional regularization .",
    "the relation between the subtraction constant @xmath129 at the scale @xmath128 and @xmath200 is @xmath201 + m_2 \\,\\ln \\left [ \\frac{\\lambda+\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + m_2 ^ 2}}{\\mu } \\right]\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] for @xmath202 , and assuming a cutoff of the same order of magnitude , @xmath199 turns out to be a natural choice for the subtraction constant @xmath129 .    the idea behind the above choice for the range of variation of the rlecs is to focus on the resonances whose dynamics is mostly determined by the unitarity loops .",
    "a clear example of one such resonance is the @xmath11 , that is dynamically generated from @xmath203 re - scattering with a cutoff value of the order of @xmath204  @xcite .",
    "this translates to @xmath205 .",
    "however , to similarly describe the @xmath2-meson , purely from @xmath203 re - scattering , requires @xmath206  @xcite .",
    "this would lead to unnatural values for the uv cutoff , of the order of @xmath207 ( note the logarithmic dependence ) .",
    "actually , the @xmath2-meson is rather insensitive to the chiral loops and its dynamics is mostly determined by the low energy constants that appear in the @xmath208 chiral lagrangian  @xcite .    in our scheme , the mesons of the @xmath2-nonet , used to build the coupled channels space , are _ preexisting states _",
    "( to adopt the terminology of  @xcite ) , rather than dynamically generated from the re - scattering of goldstone bosons . in this view ,",
    "it looks appropriated to restrict the rlecs to values that could be related to reasonable values of the uv cutoff .",
    "specifically , @xmath200 will be allowed to lie in the interval @xmath209{\\,{\\mathrm{gev}}}$ ] .",
    "even after this constraint , there is still a large freedom in varying all different rlecs .",
    "another ambiguity in the model needs to be fixed , namely , the values of the two new couplings @xmath175 and @xmath176 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsu6new ] ) , which are totally undetermined yet . to be practical , we introduce here a further simplification by imposing the relation @xmath210 this relation between @xmath175 and @xmath176 guarantees the @xmath195 sectors are not affected by the new amplitude @xmath211 . note that in the @xmath195 sector , the @xmath45 terms are constrained by chiral symmetry and that in the previous analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath211 was neglected , this sector was quite successfully described . among other ,",
    "the @xmath212 0 ^ - ( 1^{+-})$ ] @xmath17 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 , the @xmath215 @xmath16 , the @xmath216 @xmath15 and @xmath217 resonances were dynamically generated .",
    "furthermore , the double pole structure of the @xmath218 @xmath19 resonance , firstly uncovered in @xcite , was strongly confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well .",
    "assuming natural values for @xmath176 , we have let this coupling vary in the interval @xmath219 $ ] . for each value of @xmath176",
    ", we have looked at the different @xmath220 sectors for @xmath221 and @xmath222 , and have examined the pattern of generated resonances , when the rlecs @xmath129 s are left to vary in each particle  channel in the numerical range associated to uv cutoffs comprised in the interval @xmath223{\\,{\\mathrm{gev}}}$ ] .",
    "we find that , in general , the @xmath221 sectors are not much affected by the new couplings .",
    "simultaneously , values of @xmath224 yield a definitely better description of the main features of the pdg @xmath225 low - lying resonances than that achieved in ref .",
    "specifically , in the results to be presented below we have taken @xmath226 for this value of @xmath176 , a quite good overall description of the different @xmath227 sectors is obtained .",
    "small variations around this value , keeping @xmath224 , can be compensated by the rlecs leading to descriptions of similar quality .",
    "the value of the new coupling is relatively small .",
    "a tentative argument can be advanced to explain why such small value was to be expected . in the heavy quark limit",
    ", qcd shows an approximate spin - symmetry  @xcite that requires the spin symmetry breaking terms to be suppressed by at least one power of the heavy quark mass .",
    "since the operators to which @xmath176 couples ought to be suppressed in a hypothetical large @xmath106 limit , the natural combination @xmath228 that appears in the lagrangian should be of order @xmath229 , or @xmath230 , with @xmath231 standing for some energy scale relevant in the problem , in addition to the averaged vector mass .",
    ".pole positions ( in mev ) and moduli of the couplings @xmath232 ( in gev ) in the @xmath233 sector that corresponds to the @xmath234 quantum numbers .",
    "the subtraction constant has been set to the default values @xmath235 in all channels .",
    "we also compile the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath211 was set to zero , and the available information in the pdg on masses and widths ( in mev ) of the possible counterparts .",
