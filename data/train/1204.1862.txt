    "our understanding of galaxy and black hole ( bh ) formation and co - evolution has progressed significantly in recent years @xcite with new observations being able to probe the first epoch of quasar activity , and place interesting constraints on the mechanisms responsible for bh growth and galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "gaining further physical insight requires that the bh masses be determined with good accuracy in a large sample of objects .    presently , the best means for weighing bhs in quasars is via the reverberation mapping ( rm ) technique @xcite , which measures the size of the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "this , combined with a measure of the velocity dispersion of the blr , can be used to estimate the bh mass @xcite .",
    "to date , bh masses in @xmath7 low-@xmath1 objects have been measured in this way leading to various scaling laws with other quasar properties .",
    "these relations are often extrapolated to high-@xmath1 objects to allow for the _ indirect _ estimate of their bh mass @xcite . nevertheless , it is not clear that such extrapolations are meaningful , and a more direct measure of the bh mass in such objects is highly desirable .    here",
    "we report new measurements for the blr size in a @xmath8 luminous quasar , using photometric rm @xcite , and by analyzing @xmath9 years of data from the macho survey @xcite .",
    "section 2 presents the analysis and results , with a follow - up discussion in  3 .",
    "to date , some 200 quasars have been confirmed behind the magellanic clouds @xcite . in the course of analyzing their photometric data",
    ", we report our findings for macho13.6805.324 , an @xmath10 quasar at @xmath8 having a monochromatic luminosity - magnitudes from @xcite , employ a standard k - correction , and account for the extinction behind the lmc using the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see : http://ngala.as.arizona.edu/dennis/lmcext.html ) . to this end , we average over @xmath11 stars of all types in the direction of the quasar , and identify the upper turn - over in the extinction distribution , at @xmath12mag , with the effective extinction of the background source .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainty on the luminosity to be a factor 3 , to account for the potentially patchy structure of lmc disk . our estimate is consistent with @xmath13-@xmath14 for macho13.6805.324 being larger by @xmath15mag than typical ,",
    "as concluded by integrating the @xcite composite quasar spectrum over the macho bands , and assuming a galactic extinction law . using concordance ( 0.3,0.7,0.3 ) cosmology",
    ", we find @xmath16 . ]",
    "we focus on this object as it has the best - sampled @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves , as well as the highest fractional variability ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , @xmath17 , of a high-@xmath1 quasar in the @xcite sample .",
    "this object is consistent with being radio - quiet down to a flux limit of @xmath26mjy  ( 5mjy ) at 21 cm ( 13 cm ) @xcite .",
    "a more complete analysis of the macho quasar sample is deferred to a forthcoming publication .",
    "we choose to work with the original macho bandpasses rather than transform into standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "this reduces the spectral overlap as the photometric transformations require linear combinations of the macho magnitudes .",
    "light curves were filtered against poor data : all points with errors larger than @xmath18 times the mean error or those which deviate from the light curve mean by more than @xmath18 standard deviations were discarded ( fig . [ lc ] ) .      to effectively use the photometric rm technique of @xcite ,",
    "it is helpful to identify the band with the larger contribution of emission lines to its variance .",
    "if the emission line contribution to the flux may be used as a proxy to its variable component ( e.g. , as would be the case if the relative flux variations in all emission lines were similar ; see  3 ) , then by spectral decomposition and knowledge of the instrumental throughput , one can identify the line - rich and line - poor bands .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of available spectra of macho13.6805.324 is low , and the data are not flux - calibrated .",
    "nevertheless , their broad consistency with the composite quasar spectrum of ( * ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ filters ] ) motivates us to use the latter for our purpose .",
    "prominent emission lines at @xmath19 include the ] @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as well as the iron complexes ( fig .",
    "[ filters ] ) . to account for the iron - blend contribution to the spectrum",
    ", we use the iron template of @xcite .",
    "an underlying powerlaw continuum model was assumed , @xmath22 , which is somewhat different from the one used by @xcite , and better accounts for the flux level at @xmath23  ( observed ) , where little iron blend and balmer continuum emission is present .",
    "emission lines and blends were individually convolved with a single gaussian kernel of some amplitude and width , and a qualitative agreement was sought with the @xcite composite spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ filters ] ) .",
    "the solution is not strictly unique , nor very physical , and its sole purpose is to _ qualitatively _ assess the relative contribution of the various emission components to the broadband flux .",
    "weighing the decomposed spectrum by the instrumental throughput @xcite , we find that the @xmath5-band has the greater relative contribution of emission lines to its flux .",
    "specifically , the iron emission blends contribute a net of @xmath24% to the flux in the bands , with the relative contribution of the @xmath21 and ] @xmath20 to their respective bands being @xmath25 times smaller .",
    "having identified the line - rich band , we now proceed to measure the line - to - continuum time - delay .",
    "following @xcite , we compute two statistical estimators for the line - to - continuum cross - correlation function : @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes convolution and @xmath29 are the light curves in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ xis ] ) . with these definitions ,",
    "a peak at @xmath30 indicates an emission component in the @xmath5-band , which lags behind the @xmath4-band . to calculate these statistical estimators , we use two independent schemes : the interpolated cross - correlation function ( *",
    "* iccf ) and the @xmath1-transformed discrete correlation function ( * ? ? ?",
    "the former has the advantage of being somewhat more sensitive , while the latter is less affected by sampling .",
    "results for @xmath31 and @xmath32 using the iccf and zdcf schemes , and for two levels of light curve filtering , are presented in figure [ xis ] .",
    "all analyses give consistent results : @xmath31 and @xmath32 peak at @xmath33days .",
    "unsurprisingly , the peak is more significant when modest filtering ( @xmath34 ) is applied , resulting in @xmath35 being significant at the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the standard deviation ) level , respectively .    to verify that the observed signal is indeed associated with a lagging component in the @xmath5-band",
    ", we reversed our choice of line - rich and line - poor bands , and repeated the analysis : no significant peak was detected at @xmath30 ( instead , a highly significant trough was detected at @xmath33days ; not shown ) .",
    "in addition , we carried out sets of monte carlo simulations @xcite wherein the @xmath4-band light curve was convolved with a gaussian kernel having prescribed time - delay and width ( the latter was taken to be half of the former but the results are not very sensitive to the particular kernel chosen ) .",
    "the resulting light curve was then scaled down and added to the @xmath4-band signal so that the line contribution to the flux is @xmath38 .",
    "the combined light curve was then sampled with the cadence of the @xmath5-band to create a synthetic light curve , @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40-estimators were calculated for the light curve pair @xmath41 $ ] , and the results for several input time - lags are shown in figure [ xis ] .",
    "clearly , the observed signal is qualitatively reproduced by our simulations for lags of the order of 400days .",
    "this a ) confirms that the observed signal is indeed associated with a lagging emission component in the @xmath5-band and is not spurious , and b ) that the time - lag constraints deduced below are meaningful and are not significantly biased .",
    "we estimate the time - lag and its uncertainty in the following way : the peak in @xmath31 and @xmath32 is identified with the time - lag for each monte carlo realization ( a total of 100 realizations are used for each numerical scheme ) . a time - lag distribution",
    "is then obtained whose mean is identified with the time lag and its uncertainty with the standard deviation .",
    "we find that the time - lag is @xmath42days ( zdcf ) , or @xmath43days ( iccf ) for the @xmath44 statistical estimator .",
    "we conservatively estimate the lag to be @xmath45days , which corresponds to a rest - frame lag , @xmath46days .",
    "with only photometric data at hand , interpreting our findings is not straightforward : while we have a statistically robust time lag measurement , it is difficult to associate it with a specific emission line .",
    "that being said , it is very likely that the observed time - lag is associated with the iron emission blends for the following reasons : 1 ) a positive peak in @xmath35 indicates that emission lines contributing to the @xmath5-band are responsible for the signal , 2 ) the iron contribution to the @xmath5-band typically exceeds that of the @xmath47  line by a factor @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ filters ] ) , and 3 ) the implied flux variation of the iron blend is consistent with that seen in low-@xmath1 objects @xcite , and indirectly deduced for high-@xmath1 quasars @xcite% , which is consistent with the relative variations measured for individual lines by @xcite .",
    "this implies that similar flux variations of the iron blend are characteristics of quasars [ see also @xcite for some additional constraints on the time variability of emission lines in high-@xmath1 quasars ] . ] .",
    "little is known with confidence about the physical properties of the uv iron - emitting region , and a statistically significant time - lag , reflecting on its size , exists for only one additional low - luminosity source , ngc5548 @xcite . taken together , the results imply that the size - luminosity scaling for this region is consistent with that of other broad lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see our fig .",
    "[ rel ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the inferred sizes of the iron- and @xmath49-emitting regions are comparable in ngc5548 @xcite . if true also for macho13.6805.324 then we find consistency with a simple extrapolation of size - luminosity relation for the -emitting region , as obtained for lower luminosity sources , to the more luminous quasar population ( fig . [ rel ] ) .",
    "a meaningful comparison with the size - luminosity relations for other rest - uv lines is currently limited by small number statistics .",
    "once the size of the line - emitting region is known , the black hole mass may be determined via @xmath50 ( * ? ? ? * and using the normalization of @xcite ) , where fwhm is the full width at half maximum of the relevant emission line .",
    "this expression assumes that the gas is virialized and uses the fwhm as a proxy for its velocity dispersion in the black hole s potential well .",
    "nevertheless , the fwhm of the iron blend in macho13.6805.324 can not be determined from the available spectra , and it is not clear that the iron - emitting gas is virialized in quasars @xcite . with these uncertainties in mind ,",
    "we note that currently available data point to a roughly comparable size for the iron , @xmath51 , and @xmath20 emitting regions ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see our fig .",
    "[ rel ] ) region is far from being clear : two low - luminosity objects having only loose constraints on the time - lag indicate that it may be twice the size of the @xmath49 region @xcite , while a tentative time - lag measurement in a high-@xmath1 quasar indicates that the line traces the continuum level with no apparent delay @xcite . ] .",
    "if true also for macho13.6805.324 then we may use the fwhm of the carbon lines and our iron line region size measurement to estimate @xmath52 : as noted by @xcite , the @xmath49 fwhm may be affected by non - virial motions , especially for bright objects emitting close to their eddington limit . also , line de - blending may be required to properly estimate the fwhm of the @xmath20 line .",
    "lastly , a generic problem with single - epoch fwhm estimates concerns the fact that the fwhm of the varying component of the line may differ from that measured from the mean spectrum @xcite . ] .",
    "taking fwhm=@xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fit ] ) , we estimate the black hole mass to be @xmath54 with a formal uncertainty of @xmath55dex ( see fig .",
    "[ rel ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that this mass estimate does not account for potentially important , but poorly understood , systematic effects concerning the physics and geometry of the iron - blend emitting gas .",
    "it is worth noting that , being @xmath56 quieter in the radio band than s50836 + 71 @xcite , macho13.6805.324 is _ not _ a blazar , and may well be a radio - quiet object . as such , it may have the largest black hole mass ever measured using the rm technique in a representative member of the quasar population .",
    "our findings also indicate that macho13.6805.324 is probably shining at @xmath57% of its eddington luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ rel ] ) , and in agreement with similar quasars in its class @xcite .    a more reliable interpretation of our results , as well as a more accurate bh mass determination , require a higher signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "a sparse ( one visit every two months ) spectroscopic - monitoring campaign of macho13.6805.324 , over a period of @xmath58 years , will determine the variability amplitude of the iron blend as well as potentially ( independently ) measure the time - lag in this object .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing large enough samples of macho quasars , with a similar redshift and luminosity range to macho13.6805.324 , it may be possible to statistically corroborate the results presented here @xcite . with these future tests and improvements in mind ,",
    "our present findings already demonstrate the feasibility of long - term photometric surveys in determining the blr size ( and bh mass ) in luminous high-@xmath1 quasars .",
