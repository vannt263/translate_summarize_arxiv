    "then , if @xmath204 one has the following results :    ( a ) : :    the sequence @xmath205 converges to an optimal solution to    the dual problem @xmath206 , and the primal objective    function value sequence @xmath207 converges to    the optimal value ; ( b ) : :    the sequences @xmath208 and    @xmath209 are bounded , and if assumptions    @xmath96 and @xmath97 hold , the    sequence @xmath210 and @xmath211 are also    bounded ; ( c ) : :    any accumulation point of the sequence    @xmath190 is a solution to the kkt system    @xmath197 , and if    @xmath212 is one of its accumulation    point ,    @xmath213 ,    @xmath214 ,    @xmath215    and    @xmath216    as @xmath217 ; ( d ) : :    if    @xmath218    and    @xmath219 ,    then each of the subproblems in the spadmm scheme    @xmath189 has a unique optimal solution and the    whole sequence @xmath190 converges to a    solution to the kkt system @xmath197 .",
    "let @xmath75 be an arbitrary solution to the kkt system @xmath197 of problem @xmath120 .",
    "we first establish some basic results and then prove ( a ) to ( d ) one by one . in the following ,",
    "the notations provided at the beginning of this section are used .    note that @xmath220 for any @xmath138 . then , if @xmath221 , by using and we obtain that the sequences @xmath222 are all bounded , @xmath223 and @xmath224 if @xmath225 but @xmath226 , by using the equality that @xmath227 we know @xmath228 .",

    "hence , we can get @xmath240 and @xmath241 so that @xmath242 then , by using , , , and the outer semi - continuity of subdifferential mappings of closed proper convex functions we know that @xmath243 this implies that @xmath244 is a solution to the dual problem . therefore , we can conclude that any accumulation of @xmath205 is a solution to the dual problem .",
    "to finish the proof of part ( a ) , we need to show that @xmath205 is a convergent sequence .",
    "this will be done in the following .",
    "we first consider the case that @xmath221 .",
    "define the sequence @xmath245 by @xmath246 from in proposition [ prop:2 ] and the fact that @xmath247 , we know that @xmath248 is a nonnegative and bounded sequence .",
    "thus , there exists a subsequence of @xmath249 , say @xmath250 , such that @xmath251 .",
    "since @xmath252 is bounded , it must has a convergent subsequence , say , @xmath253 , such that @xmath254 exists .",
    "note that @xmath255 is a solution to the kkt system .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can reset @xmath256 from now on . by using in proposition [ prop:2 ] we know the nonnegative sequence @xmath257 is monotonically nonincreasing , and @xmath258 since @xmath259 , we have @xmath260 which indicates that @xmath205 is a convergent sequence .",
    "second , we need to consider the case that @xmath225 .",
    "define the nonnegative sequence @xmath261 by @xmath262 from we known that @xmath263 which , together with , lemma [ lemma : sq - sum ] and the fact that @xmath264 , implies that @xmath265 is a convergent sequence . as a result , by the definition of @xmath266 we know the sequence @xmath267 is nonnegative and bounded . then by choosing proper subsequences of @xmath267 and @xmath205 and repeating the previous analysis for getting and with @xmath268 and @xmath269 being replaced by @xmath266 and @xmath270 , we can establish that @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "hence , @xmath205 is also a convergent sequence .",

    "consequently , @xmath281 by the squeeze theorem .",
    "thus , part ( a ) is proved .    *",

    ", we can use    @xmath284 & -\\sigma \\langle { { \\mathcal b}}^*(z^{k-1}-z^{k}),{{\\mathcal a}}^*y^k\\rangle - \\langle{{\\mathcal s}}(y^{k}-y^{k-1 } ) , y^k \\rangle \\end{array}\\ ] ] to get the boundedness of the sequence @xmath285 .",
    "hence , from we know the sequence @xmath208 is bounded from above . from we know @xmath286",
    "which , together with the fact that the sequences in are bounded , implies that @xmath208 is bounded from below .",
    "consequently , @xmath208 is a bounded sequence . by using similar approach",
    ", we can obtain that @xmath209 is also a bounded sequence .",
    "next , we prove the remaining part of ( b ) by contradiction .",
    "suppose that assumption [ as-2 ] holds and the sequence @xmath210 is unbounded .",
    "note that the sequence @xmath287 is always bounded .",
    "thus it must have a subsequence @xmath288 , with @xmath289 being unbounded and non - decreasing , converging to a certain point @xmath290 . from the boundedness of the sequences in",
    "we know that @xmath291 and @xmath292 are bounded",
    ". then we have @xmath293 and , similarly , @xmath294 . by noting that @xmath295 , one has @xmath296 . on the other hand ,",
    "define the sequence @xmath297 by @xmath298 from the boundedness of the sequence @xmath299 and the definition of @xmath300 we know that @xmath301 .",
    "since @xmath302 , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.2 ) we know that @xmath303 is a recession direction of @xmath304 .",
    "then from the fact that @xmath305 we know that @xmath306 , which contradicts assumption [ as-2 ] .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath211 under assumption [ as-22 ] can be similarly proved .",
    "thus , part ( b ) is proved .    *",
    "( c ) * suppose that @xmath307 is an accumulation point of @xmath308 .",
    "let @xmath309 be a subsequence of @xmath308 which converges to @xmath307 . by taking limits in along with @xmath235 for @xmath236 and using ,",
    "and we can see that @xmath310 which can imply that @xmath307 is a solution to the kkt system .",
    "now , without lose of generality we reset @xmath311 .",
    "then , by part ( a ) we know that the sequence @xmath312 defined in converges to zero if @xmath313 , and the sequence @xmath314 defined in converges to zero if @xmath315 but @xmath316",
    ". thus , we always have @xmath317 as a result , it holds that @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 as @xmath217 .",
    "moreover , by using the fact that @xmath321 and @xmath322 as @xmath323 , we can get @xmath324 as @xmath323 .",
    "this completes the proof of part ( c ) .    *",
    "( d ) * if @xmath325 and @xmath326 , the subproblems in the admm scheme are strongly convex , hence each of them has a unique optimal solution . then ,",
    "by part ( c ) we know that @xmath327 and @xmath328 are convergent .",
    "note that @xmath205 is convergent by part ( a ) .",
    "therefore , by part ( c ) we know that @xmath308 converges to a solution to the kkt system . hence , part ( d ) is proved and this completes the proof of the theorem .    before concluding this note ,",
    "we make the following remarks on the convergence results presented in theorem [ theorem : c1 ] .",
    "the corresponding results in part ( a ) of theorem [ theorem : c1 ] for the admm scheme ( [ admm ] ) with @xmath329 have been stated in boyd et al .",
    "@xcite . however , as indicated by the counterexample constructed in section [ sec : example ] , the proofs in @xcite need to be revised with proper additional assumptions .",
    "actually , no proof on the convergence of @xmath205 has been given in @xcite at all .",
    "nevertheless , one may view the results in part ( a ) as extensions of those in boyd et al .",
    "@xcite for the admm scheme ( [ admm ] ) with @xmath27 to a computationally more attractive spadmm scheme with a rigorous proof .",
    "the condition that @xmath330 and @xmath331 in part ( d ) was firstly proposed by fazel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that , numerically , the boundedness of the sequences generated by a certain algorithm is a desirable property and assumptions [ as-2 ] and [ as-22 ] can furnish this purpose .",
    "assumption [ as-2 ] is pretty mild in the sense that it holds automatically , even if @xmath31 , for many practical problems where @xmath16 has bounded level sets .",
    "of course , the same comment can be applied to assumption [ as-22 ] .",
    "the sufficient condition that @xmath225 but @xmath332 simplifies the condition proposed by sun et al .",
    "but @xmath333 was used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) . ]",
    "@xcite for the purpose of achieving better numerical performance .",
    "the advantage of taking the step - length @xmath225 has been observed in @xcite for solving high - dimensional linear and convex quadratic semi - definite programming problems . in numerical computations , one can start with a larger @xmath334 , e.g. @xmath335 , and reset it as @xmath336 for some @xmath337 , e.g. @xmath338 , if at the @xmath339-th iteration one observes that @xmath340 for some given positive constant @xmath341 .",
    "since @xmath334 can be reset at most a finite number of times , our convergence analysis is valid for such a strategy",
    ". one may refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.3 ) for more discussions on this computational issue .",
    "in this note , we have constructed a simple example possessing several nice properties to illustrate that the convergence theorem of the admm scheme ( [ admm ] ) stated in boyd et al .",
    "@xcite can be false if no prior condition that guarantees the existence of solutions to all the subproblems involved is made . in order to correct this mistake",
    "we have presented fairly mild conditions under which all the subproblems are solvable by using standard knowledge in convex analysis . based on these conditions ,",
    "we have further conducted the convergence analysis of the admm under a more general and useful spadmm setting , which has the the flexibility of allowing the users to choose proper proximal terms to guarantee the existence of solutions to the subproblems . in particular , we have established some satisfactory convergence properties of the spadmm with a computationally more attractive large step - length that can exceed the golden ratio of 1.618 . in conclusion , this note has ( i ) clarified some confusions on the convergence results of the popular admm ; ( ii ) opened the potential for designing computationally more efficient admm - type solvers in the future .",
