    "the reconstruction of diagonal elements of density matrix of quantum optical states , i.e. of their photon statistics , is fundamental for various applications ranging from quantum information @xcite to the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite and quantum optics @xcite . nevertheless , at the moment",
    ", photo - detectors well suited for this purpose are not available .",
    "indeed , the choice of a detector with internal gain suitable for the measurement is not trivial when the flux of the photons to be counted is such that more than one photon is detected in the time - window of the measurement , which is set by the detector pulse - response , or by an electronic gate on the detector output , or by the duration of the light pulse .",
    "one needs a congruous linearity in the internal current amplification process : each one of the single electrons produced by the different photons in the primary step of the detection process ( either ionization or promotion to a conduction band ) must experience the same average gain and this gain must have sufficiently low spread .",
    "the fulfillment of both requisites is necessary for the charge integral of the output current pulse to be proportional to the number of detected photons .",
    "few example exist of photo - detectors that can operate as photon counters and each one has some drawback . among these ,",
    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmt s ) @xcite and hybrid photodetectors @xcite present a low quantum efficiency , since the detection starts with the emission of an electron from the photocathode .",
    "solid state detectors with internal gain , in which the nature of the primary detection process ensures higher efficiency , are still under development .",
    "highly efficient thermal photon counters have also been used , though their operating conditions are still extreme ( cryogenic conditions ) to be suited for common use @xcite .",
    "the advent of quantum tomography did provide an alternative method to measure photon number distributions @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme , which was experimentally applied to several quantum states @xcite , needs the implementation of homodyne detection , which in turn requires the appropriate mode matching of the signal with a suitable local oscillator at a beam splitter .",
    "such mode matching , generally a not extremely simple scheme to be realized , is a particularly challenging task in the case of pulsed optical fields .    on the other hand",
    ", the photodetectors usually employed in quantum optics , such as avalanche photodiodes ( apd s ) operating in the geiger mode @xcite , seem to be by definition useless as photon counters .",
    "they are the solid state devices , which present the highest quantum efficiency and the greatest stability of internal gain .",
    "however , they have the obvious drawback that the breakdown current is independent of the number of detected photons , which in turn can not be determined .",
    "the outcome of these apd s is either `` off '' ( no photons detected ) or `` on '' _ i.e. _ a `` click '' , indicating the detection of one or more photons .",
    "actually , such an outcome can be provided by any photodetector ( pmt , hybrid photodetector , cryogenic thermal detector ) for which the charge contained in dark pulses is definitely below the output current pulses corresponding to the detection of at least one photon .",
    "note that for most high - gain pmt s the anodic pulses corresponding to no photon detected can be easily discriminated by a threshold from those corresponding to the detection of one or more photons .",
    "nevertheless , recently the possibility of reconstructing photon distribution through on / off detection at different efficiencies has been analyzed @xcite and its statistical reliability investigated in some details @xcite .",
    "in addition , the case of few and small values of @xmath0 @xcite has been addressed .",
    "a first experimental application of the method of @xcite has been presented in @xcite showing the very interesting potentialities of this scheme . in short",
    "the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the measurement of on / off detection frequencies for a certain optical field when varying the quantum efficiency of the system , i.e. in practice by interposing calibrated neutral filters on the optical path .",
    "the beauty of this scheme with respect to alternative ones resides indeed in the extreme simplicity that can allow an extensive application of it to test optical fields in various applications .    with the purpose to refine these initial studies , in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the possibility of reconstructing experimentally diagonal elements of density matrix of quantum optical states and of precisely estimating their uncertainties .",
    "various examples will be considered , as pdc heralded photons , multi - thermal and attenuated coherent states .",
    "the statistics of the `` no - click '' and `` click '' events from an on / off detector , assuming no dark counts , is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the photon distribution of the quantum state with density matrix @xmath3 and @xmath0 is the quantum efficiency of the detector , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability of a single photon to be revealed . at first sight",
    "the statistics of an on / off detector appears to provide quite a scarce piece of information about the state under investigation .",
    "however , if the statistics about @xmath4 is collected for a suitably large set of efficiency values then the information is sufficient to reconstruct the whole photon distribution @xmath5 of the signal , upon a suitable truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "the procedure consists in measuring a given signal by on / off detection using different values @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of the quantum efficiency .",
    "the information provided by experimental data is contained in the collection of frequencies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of `` no click '' events and @xmath10 the total number of runs with quantum efficiency @xmath6 .",
    "then we consider expression ( [ p0 ] ) as a statistical model for the parameters @xmath11 to be solved by maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation . upon defining @xmath12 and @xmath13 we rewrite expression ( [ p0 ] ) as @xmath14 .",
    "since the model is linear and the parameters to be estimates are positive ( linpos problem ) , the solution can be obtained by using the expectation - maximization algorithm ( em ) @xcite . by imposing the restriction @xmath15",
    ", we obtain the iterative solution @xmath16}\\ : \\label{ems}\\:\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] are the probabilities @xmath18 , as calculated by using the reconstructed distribution @xmath19 at the @xmath20-th iteration . as a measure of convergence we use the total absolute error at the @xmath20-th iteration @xmath21\\right|$ ] and stop the algorithm as soon as @xmath22 goes below a given level .",
    "the total error measures the distance of the probabilities @xmath23 $ ] , as calculated at the @xmath20-th iteration , from the actual experimental frequencies . as a measure of accuracy",
    "we adopt the fidelity @xmath24 between the reconstructed distribution and the theoretical one .",
    "our reconstruction of the photon statistics is based on the ml algorithm , which by an iterative method reaches the @xmath5 best reproducing the experimental data , _",
    "i.e _ the statistics of no - clicks @xmath25 .",
    "the confidence interval on the ml determinations may be thus evaluated according to the following argument . due to the fact that ml methods are unbiased at convergence we have @xmath26 .",
    "if in practice we stop at a given iteration @xmath27 we have fluctuations in the reconstructed @xmath28 and , in turn , @xmath29 .",
    "the fluctuations in the single components @xmath5 leads to @xmath30 where we have denoted by @xmath31 the _ true _ value of the distribution . as a consequence we may write @xmath32 and , averaging over the different values of the quantum efficiency , @xmath33    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary in this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of the possibility of reconstructing experimentally diagonal elements of the density matrix , with an accurate evaluation of uncertainties , of quantum optical states by using on / off detectors .",
    "the method that has been used @xcite is based on the measurement of on / off detection frequencies for a certain optical field when varying the quantum efficiency of the system , i.e. in practice by interposing calibrated neutral filters on the optical path .",
    "various examples have been considered extending and deepening the analysis presented in ref .",
    "in particular , we have considered pdc heralded photons , multi - thermal and attenuated coherent states .",
    "estimation of uncertainties with this technique has been discussed in detail .",
    "the results of reconstruction look very good for weak coherent and heralded photon state , while a further analysis is still necessary for clarifying the case of multithermal state , despite a qualitative agreement .",
    "altogether our results further demonstrate the potentialities of this technique , whose main advantage with respect to alternative schemes resides in the extreme simplicity that allows an extensive application for testing optical fields in a wide number of applications .",
