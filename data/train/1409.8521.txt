    "observations including the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae(sne ia)@xcite , cosmic microwave background and galaxy spectra establish that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and that two - thirds of the total energy density is in the form of dark energy with negative pressure.the most viable candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath2 with a time constant equation of state .",
    "however this model suffers from serious fine tuning problems@xcite.hence many more models have been explored in the past and this remains an active area of research.recently,an alternative class of models have been proposed which involve a slowly evolving and spatially homogenous scalar field@xcite or two coupled fields@xcite.however,these `` quintessence '' models also suffer from fine tuning problem .    as an alternative to both the comological constant and quintessence ,",
    "it is also possible to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe by introducing a cosmic fluid component with an exotic equation of state , called chaplygin gas@xcite.the attractive feature of such models is that they can explain both dark energy and dark matter with a single component.the equation of state for the chaplygin gas is @xmath3,where a is a positive constant.a more generalized model of chaplygin gas is characterised by an equation of state @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a constant in the range @xmath6(the chaplygin gas corresponds to @xmath7).the energy conservation law requires that the energy density of the chaplygin gas evolves as@xcite    @xmath8    where@xmath9 is a scale factor and b is the constant of integration.the above equation indicates that the chaplygin gas behaves like non relativistic matter at early times while at later times the equation of state is dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath10 which leads to the observed accelerated expansion.models based on chaplygin gas have been found to be consistent with sne ia data@xcite , cmb peak locations@xcite and other observational tests like gravitational lensing , cosmic age of old high red shift objects etc.@xcite , as also with some combination of some of them@xcite.it has been shown that this model can be accommodated within the standard structure formation scenarios@xcite.therefore the chaplygin gas model seems to be a good alternative to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe.the main problem of the chaplygin gas model was that it produced oscillations or exponential blowup of matter power spectrums that were inconsistent with observations@xcite .",
    "however this instability can be overcome by considering the joint effect of shear and rotation that slows down the collapse with respect to the simple spherical collapse model @xcite .",
    "subsequently a _ variable _",
    "chaplygin gas model was proposed@xcite and constrained using sne ia `` gold ''",
    "this paper we try to constrain the variable chaplygin gas model parameters using lookback time analysis and latest sne ia union2.1 data set.the basic formalism of the model is reviewed in section 2.section 3 gives the general theory for lookback time.analysis of supernovae type ia data is presented in section 4.we discuss the results and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the variable chaplygin gas@xcite is characterised by the equation of state :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a positive function of the cosmological scale factor @xmath13.@xmath14and @xmath15 are constants.using the energy conservation equation in a flat friedman - robertson - walker universe and equation ( 3),the variable chaplygin gas density evolves as :    @xmath16    where b is a constant of integration .    the original chaplygin gas behavior is restored for @xmath17 and the gas behaves initially as dust - like matter and later as a cosmological constant.however,in the present case the chaplygin gas evolves from dust dominated epoch to quintessence in present times(see @xcite ) + the friedman equation for a spatially flat universe is :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter.therefore the acceleration condition @xmath20 is equivalent to    @xmath21    which requires @xmath22.this gives the present value of energy density of the variable chaplygin gas @xmath23    where @xmath24.defining @xmath25    the energy density becomes @xmath26^{1/2}\\ ] ]",
    "we consider a homogenous , isotropic , spatially flat universe described by the freidman - robertson - walker metric with the line element @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cosmological scale factor.the speed of light has been set to unity in our analysis .    the lookback time is defined as the difference between the age of the universe today @xmath29 and its age @xmath30 at redshift @xmath31.the relation between the lookback time and redshift z can be written as @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the hubble constant,@xmath34 denotes the set of all parameters in the cosmological model and @xmath35denotes the hubble parameter as defined in the model chosen .",
    "the observed lookback time to an object , a galaxy cluster for example , at redshift @xmath36 is defined as(see @xcite )    @xmath37    where    @xmath38 is the measured total expanding age of the universe ,    @xmath39is the age of the object - defined as the difference between the present age of the universe and the age of the universe when the object was born at redshift @xmath40 .    @xmath41 denotes the incubation time or delay factor which accounts for our lack of knowldege about the amount of time since the beginning of the structure formation in the universe until the formation time@xmath42 of the object .      in order to constrain the parameters of the variable chaplygin model",
    "we do a statistical analysis of the gemini deep deep survey(gdds ) lookback time estimates of high z-galaxies.the total gdds sample consists of 20 old passive galaxies distributed over the redshift range @xmath43(mc.carthy et al,2004 @xcite )    however we build our lt sample using the criterion discuss by dantas et al @xcite - given two objects at approximately the same z , the older one is selected.going by this criterion , a set of 8 data points is obtained.these are tabulated in table 1.another important aspect of the data set , as pointed out by dantas et al is that the total age of the universe is assumed to be @xmath44.this is the result obtained by mactavish et al.(2005 ) from a joint analysis involving the most recent cmb experiments .    to estimate the best fit to the parameter set @xmath45 the likelihood function",
