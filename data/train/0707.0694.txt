    "indeed , direct nlte modelling of formation of lithium lines in the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs with clf shows their rather weak response to temperature inversions , in contrast to tio lines ( pavlenko 1998 ) .",
    "lithium lines can be affected only in the case of the strongest clf producing additional flux in the blue part of the spectra , but that is unlikely in lp944@xmath020 given its age and level of h@xmath59 and x - ray activity .    finally , comparison of our revised lithium abundance for lp944@xmath020 with the calculations of lithium depletion by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows a good agreement for a mass below 0.057 @xmath23 and an age of 320@xmath180 myr ( see fig . [ _ _ evol ] ) .",
    "this result is marginally consistent with the earlier estimate of tinney ( 1998 ) , who derived a mass in the range 0.056  0.064 @xmath23 . using the same evolutionary models ,",
    "we show that this age and a mass @xmath600.057 @xmath23 are also consistent with the location of this brown dwarf in the h - r diagram ( fig .",
    "[ _ _ evol_hrd ] ) .",
    "thus , our analysis supports the young age of a few hundred million years of lp944@xmath020 as suggested by ribas ( 2003 ) , and indicates a lower mass than previously reported in the literature .",
