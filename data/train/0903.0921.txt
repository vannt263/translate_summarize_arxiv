    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprates @xcite , enormous theoretical and experimental effort has been made to investigate the superconducting pairing mechanism which leads to an unprecedented high transition temperature @xmath0@xcite-@xcite .",
    "an additional puzzle is the unknown connection between the superconducting gap of the superconducting phase and the so - called pseudogap which is a central property of the most unusual normal state of the cuprates . in particular ,",
    "the pseudogap has been subject to intense debates .",
    "studies using angle resolved photoemssion spectroscopy ( arpes ) have revealed several key features of the pseudogap in the cuprates by elucidating the detailed momentum and temperature dependence@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found that the pseudogap opens on a part of the fermi surface ( fs ) around the anti - nodal point , leaving a nongapped fs segment known as a fermi arc around the nodal direction .",
    "the pseudogap also smoothly evolves with decreasing temperature into the sc gap and was , therefore , interpreted in favor of a `` precursor pairing '' scenario @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several experimental and theoretical reports which suggest a different origin for the pseudogap , such as caused by another order which competes with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "superconductivity is usually understood as an instability from a non - superconducting state .",
    "therefore , often in theoretical investigations , the starting point was either the fermi - liquid or the anti - ferromagnetic phase at large or low doping . in this paper , we take a different approach and only consider hole fillings , in which either a superconducting or a pseudogap phase is present .",
    "a generally accepted model for the cuprates is the @xmath1-@xmath2 model which describes the electronic degrees of freedom in the copper - oxide planes for low energies .",
    "alternatively , one could also start from a one - band hubbard hamiltonian as a minimal model .",
    "however , for low energy excitations , the latter model reduces to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model so that both models are equivalent . as our theoretical approach",
    ", we use a recently developed projector - based renormalization method which is called prm @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a stepwise elimination of high - energy transitions using unitary transformations .",
    "we thus arrive at a renormalized free hamiltonian for correlated electrons which can describe the pseudogap phase .",
    "the obtained arpes spectral function along the fermi surface is in good agreement with experiment : we find well - defined excitation peaks around @xmath3 near the nodal direction which are strongly suppressed around the antinodal point . the origin of the pseudogap can be traced back to a suppression of spectral weight of the incoherent excitations in a small @xmath4-range around the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , the usual interpretations of the pseudogap origin can not be held .",
    "instead , the pseudogap is an inherent property of the unusual normal state caused by incoherent excitations .",
    "first , after a short introduction of the model in sec .",
    "ii , it seems to be helpful , to start from a short outline of the basic ideas of our theoretical approach ( prm ) in sec .",
    "a review of this approach has been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iv , the prm will be applied to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in order to investigate the pseudogap phase at moderate hole doping .",
    "the final results will be discussed in sec .",
    "v. in a subsequent paper , the supercunducting phase will also be discussed .",
    "a generally accepted model for the cuprates is the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . in particular , in the antiferromagnetic phase at small doping , it has turned out that it can be used to describe the electronic degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "we adopt the same model also for somewhat larger hole concentrations , outside the antiferromagnetic phase , where the superconducting and the pseudogap phases appear @xmath5 the model consists of a hopping term @xmath6 and an antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 stands for the hopping matrix elements between nearest ( @xmath1 ) and next - nearest ( @xmath9 ) neighbors .",
    "@xmath10 is the exchange coupling and @xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 are hubbard creation and annihilation operators .",
    "they enter the model , since doubly occupancies of local sites are strictly forbidden due to the presence of strong electronic correlations .",
    "note that the hubbard operators restrict the unitary space to states with only either empty or singly occupied local sites .",
    "they obey nontrivial anti - commutation relations @xmath13_+ & = & \\delta_{ij } \\big ( \\delta_{\\sigma \\sigma ' } { \\cal d}_\\sigma(i ) + \\delta_{\\sigma , -\\sigma ' } s_{i}^{\\sigma } \\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath14 can be interpreted as a projector which projects on the local subspace at site @xmath15 consisting of either an empty or a singly occupied state with spin @xmath16 .",
    "finally , @xmath17 is the local occupation number operator for spin @xmath16 , and @xmath18 is the @xmath19 component of the local spin operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vector formed by the pauli spin matrices . in fourier notation",
    ", the @xmath1-@xmath2 model reads @xmath22 note that for convenience , we shall somewhat change the notation . from now on ,",
    "all energies will be measured from the chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "let us start with a short introduction to the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) @xcite which we shall use as our theoretical tool .",
    "the general idea is as follows : the method starts from a decomposition of a given many - particle hamiltonian @xmath25 into an unperturbed part @xmath26 and a perturbation @xmath27 . in @xmath28 ,",
    "no parts should be contained which commute with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 accounts for all transitions with _ non - zero _ energies between the eigenstates of @xmath29 .",
    "the aim of the prm is to construct an effective hamiltonian which has the same eigenspectrum as @xmath30 , and which can be solved .",
    "the first step is to construct a new renormalized hamiltonian @xmath31 which depends on a given cutoff @xmath32 , @xmath33 with renormalized parts @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thereby , @xmath31 should have the following properties : ( i ) the eigenvalue problem of @xmath36 can be solved @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the renormalized eigenenergies and eigenvectors .",
    "( ii ) from @xmath40 , all transition operators are eliminated which have transition energies ( with respect to @xmath36 ) larger than the cutoff energy @xmath32 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the renormalization step from @xmath41 to @xmath31 can be done by use of a unitary transformation .",
    "therefore , the eigenspectrum of @xmath31 is the same as that of @xmath41 .",
    "the realization of the renormalization starts from the construction of @xmath31 . here",
    ", the knowledge of the eigenvalue problem of @xmath34 is crucial .",
    "it can be used to define generalized projection operators , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 which act on usual operators @xmath45 of the hilbert space .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath46 are necessarily neither low- nor high energy eigenstates of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath47 projects on the part of @xmath45 which consists of transition operators @xmath48 with excitation energies @xmath49 smaller than @xmath32 , whereas @xmath50 projects on the high - energy transition operators of @xmath45 .    in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath43 , the property of @xmath31 , not to allow transitions between eigenstates of @xmath34 with energy differences larger than @xmath32 , reads @xmath52 the effective hamiltonian @xmath31 is obtained from the original hamiltonian @xmath41 by use of a unitary transformation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the generator of the unitary transformation , and the condition has to be fulfilled .",
    "the renormalization procedure starts from the cutoff energy @xmath55 of the original model @xmath41 and proceeds in steps of width @xmath56 to lower values of @xmath32 .",
    "every renormalization step is performed by means of a new unitary transformation , @xmath57 here , the generator @xmath58 of the transformation from cutoff @xmath32 to the reduced cutoff @xmath59 has to be chosen appropriately ( see below ) . in this way ,",
    "difference equations are derived which connect the parameters of @xmath31 with those of @xmath60 .",
    "they will be called renormalization equations .",
    "the limit @xmath61 provides the desired effective hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "the elimination of all transitions in the original perturbation @xmath28 leads to renormalized parameters in @xmath63 . note that @xmath64 is diagonal or at least quasi - diagonal and allows to evaluate all relevant physical quantities .",
    "the final expression for @xmath64 depends on the parameter values of the original hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath64 and @xmath65 have , in principle , the same eigenspectrum because both hamiltonians are connected by a unitary transformation .",

    "according to eq .  , @xmath66 is fixed by the condition @xmath67 . as is shown in refs .",

    "note that eq .",
    "can further be evaluated , in case the decomposition of @xmath72 into eigenmodes of @xmath69 is known .",
    "formally written , we decompose @xmath73 so that @xmath74 is given by @xmath75",
    "our aim is to apply the prm to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model which is a generally accepted model for the low - energy properties of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "we consider a regime with moderate hole - dopings .",
    "the hole concentrations should be large enough for the system to be outside the antiferromagnetic phase but small enough to be in the metallic phase .",
    "our first aim is to find the decomposition of the hamiltonian into an unperturbed part @xmath26 and into a perturbation @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the hopping element @xmath1 between nearest neighbors is large compared to the exchange coupling @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 is the dominant part of the hamiltonian in the metallic phase and should be included in @xmath26 .",
    "however , also @xmath7 has a part , which commutes with the hopping term , and which will be called @xmath76 .",
    "note that this part of @xmath7 will not lead to transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 and @xmath76 together form the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath7 does not commute with @xmath6 and forms the perturbation @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath77 in the framework of the prm , the perturbation @xmath27 will be integrated out by use of a unitary transformation . in lowest order perturbation theory ,",
    "the generator of the unitary transformation @xmath58 is given by eq .   and relies on the decomposition of @xmath7 into the eigenmodes of @xmath78 .",
    "however , it will be impossible to find the exact decomposition of @xmath7 , due to the presence of hubbard operators in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we have to apply approximations . for this purpose , we start by decomposing the electronic spin operator @xmath79 into eigenmodes of @xmath80 instead of into eigenmodes of @xmath78 . here , @xmath80 is the liouville operator corresponding to the hopping part @xmath6 of @xmath26 .",
    "the exchange @xmath7 is given by a sum over products of spin operators @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the decomposition of @xmath82 into eigenmodes of @xmath83 can be used to find an equivalent decomposition of @xmath7 .",
    "the easiest way to decompose @xmath84 is to derive an equation of motion for the time - dependent operator @xmath85 , where the time dependence is governed by @xmath6 , @xmath86 due to eq .  , the first time derivative reads @xmath87 it can be interpreted as the hopping of a hole from some site @xmath88 to a neighboring site @xmath15 and vice versa .",
    "the second derivative is characterized by a twofold hopping , @xmath89 it has two different contributions .",
    "the first one describes the hopping of the hole from @xmath15 back to site @xmath88 from which it originally came and , equivalently , the hopping from @xmath88 back to @xmath15 . the second term in eq",
    ".   stands for a twofold hopping away from the starting site .",
    "let us discuss the first contribution to eq .   in more detail .",
    "the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be interpreted as local projectors on the empty state at site @xmath15 and site @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "they assure that the original sites @xmath15 and @xmath88 were empty before the first hop .",
    "their presence results from the fact that doubly occupancies of local sites are strictly forbidden which is a consequence of the strong correlations in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . in a further approximation ,",
    "let us replace @xmath92 and @xmath91 by their expectation values , @xmath93 which can be interpreted as the probability for a local site to be empty . without the second term in eq .",
    ", we are led to the following equation of motion for @xmath85 : @xmath94 obviously , the differential equation describes an oscillatory motion of @xmath85 with frequency @xmath95 , where @xmath96 note that the averaged projector @xmath97 also agrees with the hole concentration @xmath98 away from half - filling , i.e.  @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the electron filling .    before carrying on with the physical implications of eqs .",
    ", , let us discuss the influence of the hole ( or electron ) hopping in eq .",
    "to second nearest neighbors and also to more distant sites .",
    "as long as the dynamics of @xmath85 is alone governed by the hopping hamiltonian @xmath6 , all these hopping processes are important and would have to be taken into account .",
    "for instance , for a state close to half - filling outside the antiferromagnetic regime , a hole and a neighboring electron can freely interchange their positions for a system governed alone by @xmath6 .",
    "the hole can easily move through the lattice .",
    "however , the situation is different from the case , for which the dynamics is governed by @xmath101",
    ". then , we have to decompose the perturbation @xmath27 into eigenstates of @xmath78 , where @xmath78 is the liouville operator corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of @xmath84 is not governed alone by the hopping hamiltonian @xmath6 but also by the yet unknown commuting part @xmath76 of @xmath7 . however , in appendix [ d ] , it is shown that local antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations due to @xmath76 restrict the hole motion to neighboring sites .",
    "the hopping to more distant sites is strongly suppressed by spin fluctuations . therefore , the former equation of motion for @xmath85 turns out to be a good approximation for the case that the dynamics is determined by the full unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 including the exchange part .",
    "the arguments in appendix [ d ] are based on the evaluation of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath102 as follows . using the mori - zwanzig projection formalism @xmath102",
    "can be written as @xmath103 here , @xmath104 is approximately the frequency , given in eq .  ,",
    "and @xmath105 is the selfenergy .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath105 in terms of the mori scalar product reads @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is a generalized projection operator which projects perpendicular to @xmath82 and @xmath108 ( for details see appendix d ) . due to construction , the operator @xmath109 in the bra and ket of eq",
    ".   corresponds to the second line in eq .  , and describes a twofold hopping away from the original site .",
    "therefore , the selfenergy @xmath105 provides information about the hopping processes between next nearest neighbor sites and to more distant sites . in appendix [ d ]",
    "the selfenergy @xmath105 is evaluated in a factorization approximation by including the spin fluctuations from @xmath76 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ se ] , where the imaginary part of @xmath105 for a small @xmath110-vector is plotted ( solid line ) in the presence of spin fluctuations due to @xmath76 .",
    "as is seen , @xmath105 is rather small and almost @xmath4-independent over a wide frequency range .",
    "thus , the only effect of @xmath105 is to give rise to a small damping and lineshift of the resonances of @xmath111 .",
    "we have also repeated the same calculation for @xmath112 in the absence of @xmath76 , i.e.  when @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath6 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "a strong @xmath4-dependence is found for small @xmath110-values around @xmath113 .",
    "this shows that long reaching hopping processes are important in this case . from these findings",
    ", one can conclude that the hopping to more distant than nearest neighbors is of minor importance as long as the exchange part @xmath76 is not neglected in @xmath26 .",
    "a possible explanation would be that local antiferromagnetic correlations are still present at moderate hole doping outside the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "they lead locally to strings of spin defects which are well known from the hole motion in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "let us come back to the discussion of the oscillation behavior in eq .   which can be understood as follows .",
    "when an electron hops to a neighboring site , it preferably hops back to the original site , since this was definitely empty after the first hop .",
    "in contrast , the hopping to next nearest neighbor sites is energetically unfavorable due to local antiferromagnetic order .",
    "as will be shown in a forthcoming paper  @xcite , the proportionality of @xmath114 turns out to be the basic feature for the understanding of the superconducting pairing mechanism in the cuprates .",
    "the oscillation becomes less important for larger @xmath98 which agrees with the weakening of the superconducting phase for larger hole doping .",

    "in this way , all local configurations were disregarded , where two spin operators in local space are located on neighboring sites . thereby , a possible hopping between the two sites would be obstructed .",
    "the inclusion of these processes would need additional considerations .",
    "however , they would not change our results substantially .    with eqs .",
    ", we have arrived at the intended decomposition of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath123 can be decomposed into an unperturbed part @xmath26 and into a perturbation @xmath27 .",
    "it reads @xmath124 the aim of the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) is to eliminate all transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath26 which are induced by @xmath27 .",

    "<S> this approach is based on a stepwise elimination of high - energy transitions using unitary transformations . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at a renormalized free hamiltonian for correlated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the arpes spectral function along the fermi surface turns out to be in good agreement with experiment : we find well - defined excitation peaks around @xmath3 near the nodal direction , which become strongly suppressed around the antinodal point . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the pseudogap can be traced back to a suppression of spectral weight from incoherent excitations in a small @xmath4-range around the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , both mentioned interpretations of the origin of the pseudogap can not be held . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the pseudogap is an inherent property of the unusual normal state caused by incoherent excitations . in a subsequent paper , </S>",
    "<S> also the supercunducting phase at moderate hole doping will be discussed within the prm approach@xcite . </S>"
