    "a great amount of experimental and theoretical work @xcite has followed the successful realization of the superfluid(sf)-to - mott - insulator transition in ultracold bosonic gases trapped in optical lattices , in three @xcite , two @xcite , and one @xcite dimensions .",
    "ultracold atoms on optical lattices are envisioned as ideal analog simulators of hamiltonians such as the fermion hubbard model , which so far suffers from the lack of reliable analytical and numerical results . as a first step toward this goal , intensive efforts are currently under way to validate this approach by comparing experimental and theoretical results for systems such as the bose - hubbard model that are amenable to both treatments . however ,",
    "even this is challenging , since the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model is complicated by issues such as spatial inhomogeneities ( recognized early in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , finite - temperature effects @xcite , and the limited set of experimental tools available to characterize those systems .",
    "the phase diagram of the homogeneous bose - hubbard model is known to consist of ( i ) superfluid phases for all incommensurate fillings and arbitrary values of the ratio between the on - site repulsion and the hopping parameter ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the system is also superfluid for commensurate fillings when @xmath0 is smaller than some critical value @xmath2 , which depends on the dimensionality of the system and on the ( integer ) filling .",
    "( ii ) mott insulating phases are present for commensurate fillings when @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these two phases have been shown to coexist when a confining potential is added to the model @xcite .",
    "a feature in the trap , which is advantageous from the experimental point of view , is that in inhomogeneous systems mott insulating domains appear for a broad range of fillings , as opposed to the few commensurate fillings required for the translationally invariant system .",
    "this feature comes at a price , sometimes ignored for the sake of simplicity by both experimentalists and theoreticians working on these systems . in trapped lattice bosons the critical value @xmath4 for the formation of mott insulating domains in different places in the trap not only depends on the local filling and the dimensionality of the system ( the case for homogeneous systems ) but also on the total filling @xmath5 in the trap and the curvature of the confining potential @xmath6 .",
    "a useful , but approximate , understanding of the effect of confinement , which we will not employ here , can be obtained through the use of the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "one may think that having to deal with different fillings and trapping potential parameters in different experiments makes the determination of a state diagram @xcite in one particular experimental setup not relevant to any other .",
    "this is not the case . in refs.@xcite , it was shown by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations that for lattice fermions in one dimension one can define a scaled dimensionless variable , the characteristic density @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing ) , which allows one to build a state diagram in the plane @xmath9 vs @xmath0 that is insensitive to the individual values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the form for @xmath10 can most simply be understood as arising from dimensional arguments : the trap curvature @xmath6 has units of energy / length@xmath11 , so that @xmath12 has units of inverse length .",
    "one can then define a length scale @xmath13 , which for trapped systems plays a role similar to the system size @xmath14 in the homogeneous case .",
    "the characteristic density @xmath15 is then a dimensionless quantity , which for trapped systems is the analog of the filling per site @xmath16 in the homogeneous case . in other words",
    ", @xmath10 defines how one should approach the thermodynamic limit in trapped systems .",
    "the characteristic density is not only relevant to one - dimensional systems .",
    "it can be generalized to higher dimensions @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite . in recent work ,",
    "the state diagram of the three - dimensional fermi - hubbard model in a harmonic trap was obtained by using a combination of dynamical mean - field theory ( a treatment which ignores the momentum dependence of the self - energy while retaining its time fluctuations ) and the lda @xcite .",
    "one may construct the state diagram in a trap using results for the homogeneous system combined with the lda .",
    "however , this approach is only approximate for finite systems .",
    "while lda has been shown to give reasonably accurate results in many regimes under a confining potential , it is certainly bound to fail close to the critical values of @xmath0 at which mott insulating domains are formed .",
    "this is because in the homogeneous system , there are diverging correlations when one crosses the quantum critical region , i.e. , finite - size effects in the trap not only become relevant but are also unavoidable .",
    "we will show in this paper that in those regimes where lda fails , our exact qmc - based state diagram is an accurate tool for characterization of the experimental results .    since state diagrams are not available for lattice bosons , in this paper we use world - line quantum monte carlo simulations to generate the zero - temperature state diagram for the one- and two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - hubbard model under the influence of a harmonic confining potential .",
    "the state diagram in two dimensions allows us to analyze recent experimental results for confined two - dimensional bosons in optical lattices @xcite without the need to perform simulations for the same parameters as in the experiments .",
    "we find that the critical values for the formation of mott insulating domains reported in ref.@xcite are consistent ( within experimental errors ) with our theoretical results for inhomogeneous systems .",
    "finally , we will discuss the effect that a small increase in the temperature ( @xmath1 ) has on our ground - state results .",
    "the latter is found to have little consequence in two dimensions , where the @xmath0 values which demark the boundaries between states only change by a few percent .",
    "+ in one dimension , we find that the trapping potential has an even stronger influence on the critical values of @xmath0 at which mott insulating domains appear in the trap .",
    "we will also show that low temperatures have a pronounced effect on the inhomogeneous states in the trap .",
    "the important issue of how to detect experimentally the different phases in the trap is addressed in several recent works ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) and will not be discussed here .",
    "for deep enough optical lattices and low temperatures , confined bosons in two dimensions can be described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators of a boson at site @xmath22 , located at a distance @xmath23 from the center of the trap . @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are given in units of the lattice spacing , set to unity in this work .",
    "@xmath26 is the particle number operator .",
    "the on - site interaction parameter is denoted by @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude is denoted by @xmath29 , and @xmath6 is the curvature of the harmonic confining potential . in experiments on optical lattices , @xmath29 , @xmath27 , and @xmath6 can be controlled by changing the intensity of the laser beams that produce the lattice .",
    "one can also control @xmath27 separately using feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "we performed qmc simulations in the canonical ensemble , using the world - line algorithm @xcite . for our - zero temperature study",
    ", we have taken the inverse temperature to be @xmath30 , which is sufficient to obtain ground - state results for the observables considered here ( see discussion in fig .",
    "[ profiles_difftemp ] ) , and for discretizing imaginary time we have chosen @xmath31 .    in order to create the state diagram , we will monitor three local observables .",
    "the first one is the density .",
    "plateaus with constant integer density are the so - called mott insulating domains @xcite .",
    "however , since the local density always crosses integer fillings as the total number of bosons in the trap is increased , and since close to integer local fillings and for large enough values of @xmath0 one always sees some kind of shoulder appearing in the density profiles ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , figs .",
    "[ 3d_density ] and [ profiles_difftemp ] ) , identifying the formation of mott domains only by means of the density is not accurate @xcite .",
    "the second local quantity we monitor is the quantum fluctuations of the density , also referred to as the variance of the density , @xmath32 as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , this quantity exhibits a local minimum for densities closest to integer fillings .",
    "in addition , once a mott insulating domain forms , the value at the minimum equals the value of the variance in the mott insulating phase of an equivalent homogeneous system , i.e. , a translationally invariant system with exactly the same density and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we will show here that in our finite lattice - boson systems ( such as the ones created experimentally ) , shoulders with @xmath33 can appear without the variance of the density on those shoulders attaining the value in the homogeneous mott insulator .",
    "that is , those shoulders are not local mott insulating domains .    the final quantity that we measure here is the local compressibility defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath34.\\ ] ] this local compressibility quantifies the response in the on - site density to a local change of the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath35 also exhibits a minimum around integer fillings , and it behaves , qualitatively , similarly to @xmath36 . an analogous distinction between equal - time fluctuations and susceptibilities which include unequal - time correlations plays an important role in the fermion hubbard model , where the local susceptibility carries additional information about the ( kondo ) screening beyond that contained in the equal - time local moment .      in fig .",
    "[ 3d_density ] , we show two density profiles in a two - dimensional harmonic trap for values of the on - site repulsive interaction right before ( @xmath37 ) and right after ( @xmath38 ) the formation of the mott insulator in the middle of the trap . for @xmath37 [ fig .

    "to conclude this subsection on local observables , we discuss whether the lattice size considered in figs .",
    "[ 3d_density ] and [ 3d_variancecompress ] is big enough so that _ boundary conditions _ are irrelevant , and whether the temperature is low enough so that @xmath62 , and @xmath51 behave as they will in the ground state . in fig .",
