    "there are two fundamental , principally non - perturbative phenomena of the strong interaction which should be explained by qcd : confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . soon after the advent of qcd chiral symmetry breaking has been explained by assuming that the qcd vacuum contains an ensemble of instantons and anti - instantons @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations have , however , shown that instantons can not be responsible for confinement since they account for only about ten percent of the string tension @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent lattice calculations have produced mounting evidence that confinement is due to the condensation of center vortices in the yang - mills vacuum @xcite . since on the lattice",
    "the confinement phase transition is observed to occur at the same temperature @xcite at which chiral symmetry is restored , one expects that chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are triggered by the same mechanism .",
    "since instantons can not explain confinement one wonders whether center vortices are also capable of producing chiral symmetry breaking in addition to confinement .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that in a yang - mills ensemble devoid of center vortices the relevant order parameter , the quark condensate vanishes @xcite .",
    "this does , however , not yet mean that center vortices produce chiral symmetry breaking in the qcd vacuum , since the field - configurations which produce it could be tied or attached to center vortices and simultaneously removed with the latter .",
    "it is therefore still an open question whether center vortices produce chiral symmetry breaking and what the underlying mechanism behind this is .    in order to get an idea how chiral symmetry breaking",
    "could be produced by center vortices let us first recall how it arises in the instanton picture of the qcd vacuum . in this picture the zero modes of quarks in the instanton background play a crucial role .",
    "these zero modes occur due to the topological charge of the instantons and are localized near their topological charge density @xcite .    in an instanton - anti - instanton ensemble the localized zero modes of the individual instantons spread out in space and form a continuum of quasi zero modes which by the banks - casher relation",
    "give rise to a non - zero quark condensate @xcite .",
    "in fact , independent of the instanton picture lattice calculations show a strong correlation between topological charge density and the quark condensate @xcite .",
    "this correlation is mainly due to the zero modes which exist in topologically non - trivial gauge fields with non - vanishing pontryagin index due to the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite and which are localized at topological charge .    in center vortex field configurations",
    "topological charge is concentrated at the intersection points and other singular points like twisting points @xcite . near these singular points",
    "we expect localization of quark zero modes which could play a similar role in the explanation of chiral symmetry breaking in the vortex picture as they do in the instanton picture . in a first attempt towards an understanding of chiral symmetry breaking in the vortex picture , in the present paper we study",

    "we will first study the dirac equation in this plane , i.e.  in @xmath2 .",
