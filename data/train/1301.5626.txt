    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; aihara et al .",
    "2011 ) represents the dawn of a new era in astronomy , in which wide - field sky surveys play increasingly important roles .",
    "such surveys are of key importance for our understanding of structure in the universe , both locally and at cosmological distances . in this sense",
    ", it is particularly important that the properties of key distance indicators , such as rr lyrae stars , are well - understood and properly calibrated on the basis of sdss photometric indices .    in the wake of the sdss survey itself , the sdss photometric system ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 , 2011 ) has gained much visibility , and sdss filters are now commonly available at all major observatories . indeed , many of the current and future wide - field dedicated telescopes and surveys , including the large synoptic survey telescope ( _ lsst _ ; ivezi et al .",
    "2008b ) , _ panstarrs _ ( kaiser et al . 2002 ; stubbs et al . 2007 ) , the _ vlt _ survey telescope ( _ vst _ ; kuijken et al . 2002 ) , the dark energy survey ( des ; tucker et al . 2007 ) , and _ skymapper _ ( keller et al . 2007 ; bessell et al .",
    "2011 ) , will be ( or are already ) carried out using filter systems that generally bear close resemblance to the original sdss system .    while it is known that the sdss system possesses great scientific potential for a variety of science applications , including stellar populations ( e.g. , lenz et al .",
    "1998 ; helmi et al . 2003 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2008a ; lardo et al .",
    "2011 ; vickers et al .",
    "2012 ) , the behavior of variable stars in general in such filter systems has not yet been as extensively studied as for more traditional filter systems , particularly the johnson  cousins system . for instance , no systematic studies of rr lyrae variability in globular clusters has yet been carried out in the sdss system , and similarly theoretical analyses of rr lyrae variable stars in the sdss system are almost entirely lacking , with the studies of marconi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) seemingly representing the sole exceptions . to extract the maximum amount of information from extensive rr lyrae databases that are increasingly becoming available in the sdss ( or similar ) systems ( e.g. , sesar 2011 ; sesar et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 , 2011 ) , more extensive theoretical analyses are clearly needed .    in this sense",
    ", we recently started a systematic study , based on theoretical models and synthetic calculations for horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars , to define precise relations that should allow one to calculate distances , reddening and metallicity values , and physical parameters of rr lyrae stars from sdss photometric observations .",
    "in cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) we presented the first detailed calibration of the rr lyrae period  luminosity ( pl ) and period  color ( pc ) relations in the sdss system .",
    "one shortcoming of the cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) pl and pc calibrations is that they require _ a priori _ knowledge of the metallicity , which is frequently not available , especially for field stars .",
    "currently this requires either spectroscopic information or fourier decomposition of @xmath1-band light curves , whose parameters have been calibrated in terms of metallicity ( jurcsik & kovcs 1996 ; morgan et al .",
    "however , as pointed out by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) , such calibrations of fourier - decomposition parameters are not applicable to all rr lyrae stars , requiring very well - behaved light curves .",
    "in addition , exceedingly complete phase coverage is required for the computation of reliable fourier parameters .",
    "therefore , calibrations that are based solely on the _ average _ photometric properties of the rr lyrae stars are certainly desired .",
    "the main purpose of the present project is thus to extend the cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) study , by providing an additional set of analytical expressions that allow one to compute metallicities , luminosities , temperatures , masses , gravities , and radii of rr lyrae stars , solely on the basis of their average photometric properties .",
    "our numerical experiments have shown that it is possible to derive fairly precise relations in the multiband sdss and strmgren ( 1963 ) systems , whereas we have not achieved similar success for the johnson ",
    "cousins @xmath2 system .",
    "the hb simulations computed in the present paper follow the same techniques as described in catelan ( 2004 ) and catelan et al . ( 2004 ) , to which the reader is referred for further details and references about the hb synthesis method . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the same hb simulations as already employed in our study of the pl and pc relations in the sdss filter system ( cceres & catelan 2008 ) .",
    "in this study , we define two _ pseudocolors _ in the sdss system , @xmath3 these indices are patterned after the well - known gravity and metallicity indices of the strmgren ( 1963 ) system .",
    "similarly to what happens in the latter system , both indices are fairly insensitive to reddening , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) already showed that the introduction of @xmath6 allows one to compute precise relationships for the derivations of absolute magnitudes and colors in the sdss system ; we have found that @xmath7 is also very helpful , as far as derivation of metallicity and the remaining physical parameters of rr lyrae stars is concerned .",
    "full details of this investigation will be provided elsewhere ; here we give only a brief preview of our results , showing a preliminary , small subsample of the relations derived so far . in all relations that follow , the ( fundamentalized ) period is given in days .                    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 can be obtained from the equations provided in cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient here is @xmath32 , and the standard error of the estimate is @xmath33  dex .",
    "note that , by using the previous equations , the definition of surface gravity , and the stefan  boltzmann law , one can also derive high - precision masses and radii .",
    "more specifically , masses derived on the basis of these expressions have an internal @xmath34 m@xmath35 , whereas in the case of radii one has @xmath36 r@xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37 }   = \\mathcal{a } + \\mathcal{b } \\frac{{\\rm [ fe / h]}_{0}^{2}}{(u - g)_0 } + \\mathcal{c } m_0 ( \\log p)^2                          + \\mathcal{d } m_0 { \\rm [ fe / h]}_{0}^{2 } ,   \\label{eq : metal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath37_{0 } }   = \\mathcal{e } + \\mathcal{f } c_0 ^ 2 m_{0 } ,   \\label{eq : metal0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath44 , and the standard error of the estimate is @xmath45  dex .",
    "we have run extensive tests to check the robustness of the relations provided , based on independent sets of hb models covering a wider range of metallicities than originally used in cceres & catelan ( 2008 ) , as well as empirical data , particularly for [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , de lee et al .",
    "2007 ; de lee 2008 ; and references therein ) .",
    "we find that the relations can be safely used , even outside their original range of applicability , provided that errors in the measurements of the colors and magnitudes of the ` equivalent static star ' are not larger than 0.010.05  mag . in this context ,",
    "work along the lines of bono et al .",
