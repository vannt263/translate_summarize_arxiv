    "the truncation of @xmath557 to rank @xmath89 is not transversal , yet it is a principal sum of any of its single - element deletions and a loop , both of which are transversal , so the hypothesis @xmath565 in statement ( 1 ) can not be omitted .",
    "the principal sum in figure [ prtrans ] shows the necessity of the hypothesis @xmath419 in statement ( 2 ) : in that example , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fundamental transversal , but the principal sum is not fundamental . let @xmath4 be the free extension of @xmath558 by an element @xmath112 .",
    "note that @xmath4 is a semidirect sum of @xmath568 and @xmath569 , and while @xmath4 is fundamental transversal , @xmath569 is not transversal .",

    "this example and the last paragraph of section [ sec : othercon ] also show that statements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) do not extend to the semidirect sums given by the higgs lift construction in theorem [ thm : higgsgivessd ] . along with the following remarks",
    ", this example also shows that these results also do not extend to the construction in theorem [ wedgethm ] : if @xmath0 is a free matroid , then the semidirect sums of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the coextensions of @xmath1 to @xmath5 that have rank @xmath570 ; furthermore , all such coextensions arise from the construction in theorem [ wedgethm ] .",

    "to prove statements ( 2)(4 ) , we will use the following result , the first part of which is a refinement by ingleton of a result by mason ( see @xcite ) ; the second part is from @xcite , where proofs of both assertions can be found .",

    "restrictions of transversal matroids are transversal .",
    "contractions of transversal matroids by cyclic sets are transversal .",
    "the same holds for fundamental transversal matroids .    with the essential assumption that the sets being contracted are cyclic ,",
    "it is not hard to give the required presentations of the contractions in statement ( iii ) ; alternatively , these assertions can be proven using proposition [ prop : ftmchar ] and the observation that the closure of a cyclic set is a cyclic flat , and for @xmath578 , @xmath579    to prove part ( 3 ) , assume that @xmath4 is transversal .",
    "statement ( ii ) above implies that @xmath0 is transversal since @xmath580 . to simplify the proof that @xmath1 is transversal , we first reduce it to the case in which @xmath0 is a free matroid .",
    "let @xmath581 be the largest cyclic flat of @xmath0 , so @xmath581 consists of all elements of @xmath2 other than the coloops of @xmath0 . since @xmath582 ,",
    "the set @xmath581 is cyclic in @xmath4 , so @xmath583 is transversal by statement ( iii ) above .",
    "elements in @xmath2 are loops in @xmath147 , so lemma [ lem : uniondel ] gives @xmath584 which is also a matroid union of the type in theorem [ unionthm ] .",
    "the set @xmath585 on which @xmath586 is defined is the set of coloops of @xmath0 , so @xmath586 is a free matroid .",
    "this justifies the reduction .",
    "thus , let @xmath0 be the free matroid on @xmath2 . for a circuit @xmath102 of @xmath1 , let @xmath587 be the subset @xmath588 of the basis @xmath2 of @xmath0 given by equation ( [ ibc ] ) .",
    "part ( 2 ) of lemma [ lem : ncircuits ] gives @xmath589 . for a cyclic set @xmath590 of @xmath1 , let @xmath591 be the union of all sets @xmath587 as @xmath102 ranges over the circuits of @xmath1 that are contained in @xmath590 .",
    "thus , @xmath591 is the minimum subset of @xmath2 , relative to inclusion , with @xmath592 .",
    "we will use the following results about @xmath591 , which we prove below :    * if @xmath593 is also a cyclic set of @xmath1 , then @xmath594 , * @xmath595 is a cyclic set of @xmath4 , * if @xmath596 , then @xmath597 , * all elements of @xmath598 are coloops of @xmath599 , * @xmath600 , and * if @xmath601 are cyclic sets of @xmath1 , then @xmath602    property ( a ) holds by construction , as does property ( b ) since , as noted above , if @xmath161 , then @xmath589 . for property",
    "( c ) , the set @xmath603 is a flat of @xmath147 and @xmath604 is a flat of @xmath149 that contains @xmath590 and intersects @xmath2 in @xmath591 , so , by corollary [ cor : flats ] , their intersection , which is @xmath595 , is a flat of @xmath4 ; this observation and property ( b ) prove property ( c ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that all elements of @xmath598 are coloops of @xmath605 , so @xmath595 is the largest cyclic subset of @xmath603 in @xmath149 ; by corollary [ cor : cyclicsets ] , it follows that @xmath595 is the largest cyclic subset of @xmath603 in @xmath4 , which proves property ( d ) . since @xmath606 and @xmath2 is independent in @xmath4 , we have @xmath607 ; the equality in property ( e ) follow from this equality and property ( d ) .",
    "the equality in part ( f ) follows similarly since elements in @xmath2 that are not in all @xmath608 are coloops of the restriction of @xmath4 to @xmath609 .    to show that @xmath1 is transversal , let @xmath287 be a nonempty collection of cyclic flats of @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath610 , let @xmath611 .",
