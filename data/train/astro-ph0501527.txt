    "radio signals received from distant pulsars fluctuate in time and space due to inhomogeneities in the ionized component of the interstellar medium .",
    "observations of pulsar scintillations have thus served as a valuable tool for reconstructing the statistics of interstellar electron - density fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among a variety of observational quantities ,",
    "special attention has been given to the time shape of the pulsar signal @xmath2 ( the signal intensity as a function of time ) .",
    "this function arises from the interference of waves propagating along different paths ( similar to the feynman interpretation of the propagation of a quantum particle ) .",
    "the deviation of the wave paths from a straight line causes a time - broadening of the arriving signal .",
    "the intensity function @xmath2 can be interpreted as the probability density function ( pdf ) of the time delays caused by different paths of propagation .",
    "since the statistics of the path deviations are directly related to the statistics of electron density fluctuations , the function @xmath2 provides information on the latter .",
    "@xcite recently used the observed time shapes of the measured pulses to probe the shape of the distribution function of the underlying density fluctuations .",
    "based on a comparison of analytical results and observational data , they proposed that the density fluctuations responsible for the pulse broadening are non - gaussian , with the distribution function of the resulting angular path deviations having a slowly declining , power - law asymptotic .",
    "they further deduced that the density fluctuations should be strong on very small scales ( estimated in ",
    "[ difference ] to be @xmath3 ) .    after being suitably rescaled by the pulsar distance and the observation wavelength ,",
    "the observed pulse time shapes exhibit a somewhat `` universal '' behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that similar processes govern the density fluctuations along different lines of sight .",
    "two intriguing questions then arise regarding the physics of interstellar plasma fluctuations .",
    "first , how are strong small - scale density fluctuations generated ? and second , how can density fluctuations produce a non - gaussian , power - law distribution of scattering angles ?    in addressing these questions one can consider two distinct ( although not mutually exclusive ) possibilities . in one interpretation",
    "the observed universality is attributed to a general _ statistical _ property of density fluctuations .",
    "for example , in kolmogorov - type turbulence , small - scale fluctuations arise as a result of an energy cascade from large to small scales .",
    "the properties of the observed signals might then be linked to the universal properties of such a cascade .",
    "the second possibility is that density fluctuations are strongly nonuniform and spatially intermittent ( e.g. , clumps , filaments , and shocks ) . in this case",
    ", the universality could reflect a certain inherent property of the density structures .",
    "this property should be fairly robust in view of the fact that different mechanisms ( not necessarily related to turbulence ) could in principle give rise to a particular structure .",
    "for example , scattering by shocks may be universal if the only property that matters is a sharp density discontinuity  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the first possibility .",
    "we assume that interstellar scattering occurs in turbulent ionized regions ( hii regions ) of mean density @xmath4 .",
    "such regions appear when bright stars turn on within or in the vicinity of cold molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "large - scale density fluctuations in a cold molecular cloud of mean density @xmath5 are of the order @xmath6 , since such clouds are usually turbulent with mach numbers greater than 1  @xcite .",
    "when cold neutral gas in a molecular cloud is ionized by a newborn massive star emitting @xmath7 ionizing photons  @xmath8 , the radius of the ionized sphere ( the strmgren radius ) is @xmath9 .",
    "this ionization happens very fast , during the first @xmath10 years after the radiation turns on .",
    "this time interval is much shorter than the sound crossing time in the ionized gas within the strmgren sphere , where the sound speed is @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , the initial density inhomogeneities relax due to pressure gradients , which drive turbulent internal motions in the hii region .",
    "the longest relaxation time corresponds to the largest spatial scale , and therefore the turbulence that survives over the lifetime ( @xmath12 ) of the star is effectively stirred on the scale @xmath13 , where the velocity and density fluctuations are of the order of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the interstellar medium is magnetized and the magnetic field is likely to play a role in any turbulent energy cascade . as discussed by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , density perturbations in an mhd turbulence are associated with compressible and entropy modes and are _ passively _ advected by the alfvnic cascade toward the smallest ( dissipative ) spatial scales .",
    "the cascade proceeds predominantly in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and continues until the fluctuations reach the scale of the ion gyroradius  @xmath16 .",
    "a typical strength of the magnetic field in the galaxy is a few @xmath17 @xcite . for an ion temperature @xmath18 and magnetic field amplitude @xmath19 ,",
    "the gyroradius is @xmath20 , so the density fluctuations can reach very small scales .",
    "however , a problem arises when we address the statistics of density fluctuations that are advected as a passive scalar in mhd turbulence .",
    "numerical results show that passive scalar fluctuations in an incompressible turbulence have an exponential ( or stretched exponential ) distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not the power - law distribution that we are trying to explain .",
    "another problem arises when we recall that the fluctuations were inferred to be strong on scales as small as @xmath3 . to reach these scales ,",
    "the envisioned cascade would have to pass through a scale where the eddy turnover time is comparable to the radiative cooling time of the plasma , at which point the density fluctuation may be strongly damped @xcite .",
    "the radiative cooling time for ionized gas of temperature @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 @xcite , so for @xmath4 and a kolmogorov - like turbulence , the cooling scale is @xmath23 , significantly larger than the scales we are trying to account for .",
    "in view of the foregoing arguments it appears difficult to attribute the inferred non - gaussian scattering by small - scale density fluctuations to a nearly incompressible mhd turbulence excited on scales @xmath24 . in   [ origin ] we discuss a possible means of exciting the turbulence on scales smaller than @xmath25 ( to account for the inferred strength of the small - scale fluctuations ) and appeal to kinetic effects ( which could make the turbulence compressible ) for further enhancement of the fluctuations and the possible establishment of a power - law spectrum on scales close to @xmath16 . however , our main focus in this paper is on exploring the second of the above two possibilities for the origin of the inferred density fluctuations , namely , that the spatial distribution of the scattering electrons is highly intermittent .",
    "specifically , we propose that these electrons are contained in thin , shell - like structures .",
    "although we show that the statistical properties of the scattered radio pulses are independent of the physical origin of the shells , we argue that the latter can be most plausibly identified with the thin surface layers of molecular regions ( clouds ) that become ionized by the interstellar radiation field or by ionizing photons from nearby stars .",
    "the ionized surfaces of dense molecular clouds were previously invoked by @xcite to explain ( on the assumption that these layers are magnetized and turbulent ) the observed anisotropy in the angular broadening of the radio source sgr a * in the galactic center .",
    "furthermore , localized scattering structures ( such as shocks or filaments ) have been invoked by @xcite and by @xcite to explain the observed scaling of pulsar signals with frequency and the results of certain diffractive measurements .",
    "small - scale localized electron density structures have also been inferred from observations of extreme scattering events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pulsar arclet structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and pulsar scintillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although these investigations were carried out in the context of the gaussian model and thus do not bear directly on the results presented here ( which aim to justify a non - gaussian interpretation ) , their appeal to sharply delineated scattering regions has inspired our work .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the non - gaussian , power - law statistics inferred for the angular scattering of pulsar radio pulses need not be related to the character of density fluctuations inside turbulent scattering regions but can be fully explained in terms of the spatially intermittent nature of thin ionized shells in the interstellar medium ( which in principle need not even be turbulent ) . using purely geometric - optics considerations",
    ", we show that scattering by thin spherical shells produces a distribution of angular deviations @xmath26 with an asymptotic power - law probability density @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the form deduced in @xcite by applying the non - gaussian ( lvy ) scattering theory to the pulsar scintillation data .",
    "this correspondence strongly suggests that the scattering regions that produce refractive radio scintillations have a morphology of curved shells .",
    "after briefly outlining the theory of pulsar scintillations (   [ motivation ] ) , we discuss the key differences between gaussian and non - gaussian models of density fluctuations (   [ difference ] ) . in   [ shells ] we flesh out our proposal that scattering by thin ionized boundaries of molecular clouds can naturally explain the inferred non - gaussian statistics of the scintillations . in   [ origin ] we consider the case in which the ionizing radiation is strong enough to trigger an ionization front instability and possibly the development of turbulence within the ionized cloud boundaries .",
    "our results are summarized in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we explain how the statistics of electron - density fluctuations can be diagnosed by observations of the time shapes of pulsar signals . to this end , we assume that the scattering ( refraction ) of a radio wave coming from a distant pulsar occurs in separate planar phase screens , uniformly placed along the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "we denote the line - of - sight axis by  @xmath28 and the coordinates in the perpendicular plane by a two - dimensional vector  @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the scattered wave is planar and propagates close to the line of sight . to analyze this model",
    "one can make use of the so - called parabolic approximation , which assumes that the wave amplitude changes slowly compared to its phase .",
    "the details of this analysis can be found in a number of references ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; here we only give a qualitative discussion of the results .",
    "each scattering screen generates phase fluctuations that cause the transmitted wave to contain many different angular components in its spectrum rather than follow a single direction .",
    "the spatial scale of the fluctuations that contribute to an angular deviation @xmath26 ( expressed in radians ) is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the wavelength .",
    "the difference of phases accumulated in a single screen along two lines of sight separated by the distance @xmath29 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "it is proportional to the line - of - sight integrated density difference @xmath33 d z\\ , \\label{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the integration length  @xmath36 should exceed the characteristic size of the scattering region . to produce an angular deviation @xmath26 , the phase difference should be @xmath37 on the scale @xmath30 .",
    "( where here , as in the rest of this paper , angles are measured in radians ) .",
    "the signal emitted by a pulsar has a rather short duration ( several percent of the pulsar period ) .",
    "the received signal is broader , with its intensity  @xmath2 exhibiting a sharp rise and a slow decline .",
    "this happens because waves propagating along different paths from the pulsar to earth experience different angular deviations by the electron density prisms that intercept them .",
    "this , in turn , leads to different time delays relative to straight ( undeflected ) propagation . the signal intensity corresponding to a time delay  @xmath38 is proportional to the probability for a path to be delayed by  @xmath38 ( e.g. , *",
    "assume that the number of scattering screens is  @xmath39 and the distance between two neighboring screens along the line of sight is  @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 is the distance to the pulsar .",
    "the angle of the path in the segment between screens @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a sum of the angular increments accumulated at the preceding segments , @xmath44 . in general , @xmath45 is a two - dimensional vector , pointing in the direction of the path deviation .",
    "the time delay introduced by the @xmath43th scattering segment is therefore @xmath46 , and the total time delay is the sum of the individual delays , @xmath47 ^ 2\\ .",
    "\\label{tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation the individual angular increments @xmath45 are independently and identically distributed two - dimensional vectors .",
    "the intensity @xmath2 of the received signal , which is effectively the pdf of @xmath38 , can be found numerically using equation  ( [ tau ] ) once the distribution function for the vectors @xmath48 is known .    in the classical theory of scintillations",
    "the vectors @xmath48 are assumed to have an independent and identical gaussian distribution , in which case an exact analytic solution for the @xmath38-distribution function @xmath2 can be derived ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the scaling and shapes of pulse profiles predicted by this theory seem to disagree with the observational results for distant pulsars , as first noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in a recently proposed alternative model , @xcite demonstrated that the observed profiles can be matched if the individual fluctuations @xmath48 have a non - gaussian , power - law  like declining distribution . in this case the wave path angle  @xmath49 exhibits a so - called lvy flight rather than the standard random walk .",
    "the lvy distribution function is a general distribution function whose convolution with itself produces the same function again ( appropriately rescaled ) .",
    "the gaussian distribution is a particular case of a lvy distribution .",
    "a detailed discussion of lvy distributions can be found in @xcite ; the application to wave propagation in the interstellar medium is considered in @xcite . for our present purposes ,",
    "the main relevant property of the lvy distribution is its slow ( power - law ) asymptotic decline .",
    "whereas @xmath50 for a gaussian random walk , the scaling produced by a lvy flight is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( which satisfies @xmath53 ) is the parameter of the lvy distribution .",
    "for @xmath54 , the lvy pdf exhibits a power - law decline , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a typical angular fluctuation value .",
    "pulsar signals are observed to satisfy the scaling @xmath58 ( more precisely , the observationally inferred scaling is @xmath59 , where the pulsar dispersion measure , @xmath60 , is proportional to the distance to the pulsar and , therefore , to the number of scattering events ,  @xmath39 ) , which motivated @xcite to propose that radio scintillations are described by a lvy model with @xmath61 .",
    "a gaussian distribution corresponds to @xmath62 and implies a linear scaling of @xmath63 with @xmath43 , which is not consistent with the observational data . in ",
    "3 we demonstrate that the difference in the implied scaling between these two models corresponds to a profound difference in the physics of the respective scattering mechanisms .",
    "we assume that the pdf of @xmath64 has a characteristic width @xmath57 ( corresponding , say , to the @xmath65 amplitude level ) , and we denote the width of the resulting pdf of @xmath38 by @xmath66 .",
    "equation  ( [ tau ] ) and the scaling @xmath67 imply that @xmath66 scales as @xmath68 in a gaussian model . on the other hand , if we consider @xmath66 to arise from the action of individual fluctuations , each of magnitude @xmath64 , we find ( using eq .  [ [ tau ] ] again ) that @xmath69 . by comparing these two expressions",
    "we obtain , as expected , @xmath70 , which is consistent with the notion that the typical time delay may be produced by many small deflections .",
    "the situation is quite different in the lvy case with @xmath71 .",
    "equation  ( [ tau ] ) implies @xmath72 , and if we compare this expression with our estimate in terms of individual fluctuations , @xmath73 , we infer that such fluctuations must be _ large _ ,  @xmath74 . but such large individual fluctuations have a small probability , @xmath75 , and it is therefore highly unlikely that all @xmath39 individual fluctuations are of that order . instead , the most probable situation is that _ one _ of the fluctuations is extremely large , @xmath76 , whereas all the others are small ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "thus , in each particular realization , the total scattering is most probably produced by only one , randomly chosen , screen .",
    "this behavior is a general property of sums of lvy - distributed variables with @xmath78 @xcite . when the pulse shape is averaged over a certain time interval ( or over a statistical ensemble ) , these screens can be different in different realizations , since the interstellar medium fluctuates and both the pulsar and the earth move through it .",
    "we can now estimate the width of the pulse as @xmath79 , where @xmath41 is again the pulsar distance .",
    "this expression has a geometric meaning , namely , that only one refractive event dominates the path deviation from a straight line .",
    "for the typical parameters of distant pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( corresponding to a frequency of @xmath83 ) , we obtain @xmath84 and a density fluctuation scale @xmath85 . in view of the scaling @xmath86 ,",
    "closer pulsars ( characterized by @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) correspond to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "what regions in the interstellar medium might be responsible for the indicated strong scattering events ? to address this question , we first consider whether the maximal angular deviation estimated above could be produced by regions of uniform and homogeneous turbulence . in the following discussion we therefore neglect the contribution of the boundaries of the turbulent regions or of any other structures .",
    "the amplitude of the density fluctuations that give rise to the large inferred angular deviations can be estimated from the results presented after equation  ( [ n ] ) , which imply @xmath91 this defines the value that the density fluctuations must be able to reach on the scale  @xmath92 .",
    "suppose that the density fluctuations are associated with a turbulent cascade .",
    "if the density is passively advected by the fluid turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) then the density scaling follows that of the velocity field , and for a spatially homogeneous turbulence with an outer scale  @xmath93 we have @xmath94 . here",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath96 are , respectively , the rms values of the velocity and density fluctuations on the scale @xmath93 and @xmath97 is the turbulence scaling exponent , which ranges between 2/3 ( the kolmogorov case ) and",
    "2 . this estimate neglects damping effects , which can be different for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; we discuss damping further on in this section .    as we pointed out in",
    "  [ introduction ] , the distribution function of density fluctuation amplitudes in kolmogorov turbulence declines faster than a power law .",
    "the central limit theorem then implies that the distribution of line - of - sight integrated density fluctuations is gaussian . under these conditions , the @xmath92-dependence of the integrated density difference is @xmath100 where @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "equation ( [ caln ] ) follows directly from the expression for the correlator @xmath105 ^ 2 \\rangle$ ] in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulence .",
    "note that this correlator is proportional to the integration distance @xmath36 , as expected for gaussian fluctuations .    in the standard picture of scintillations ( the first scenario discussed in ",
    "[ introduction ] ) , turbulent hii regions around bright stars are considered to be the likely sites of radio - wave scattering . in this case the outer scale of the turbulence , @xmath106 , is of the order of the size @xmath36 of the strmgren sphere . setting @xmath107 in equation  ( [ caln ] ) and comparing with equation  ( [ nperp ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following condition on the large - scale density fluctuations : @xmath108 taking the velocity difference at @xmath93 to be of the order of the sound speed in the ionized region ( @xmath109 ) and assuming ( conservatively ) that the turbulence in the h ii region indeed obeys a kolmogorov scaling ( @xmath110 ) and that @xmath111 , we find that equation  ( [ dn ] ) is satisfied on this scale for electron density fluctuations @xmath112",
    ".    although this value is consistent with the typical densities of molecular clouds , in reality the required value of @xmath96 should be much larger ( and therefore implausible ) in view of the fact that the compressible and entropy mhd modes associated with the density fluctuations are damped when the wave cascade passes through the cooling scale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is about @xmath113 in this case ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "the cooling length constraint limits the ability of the standard picture to explain the strong , small - scale density fluctuations that are required in the lvy - flight scenario .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in   [ introduction ] , the distribution of passive scalar fluctuations in the incompressible mhd model is not power - law  like .",
    "these two difficulties suggest that non - gaussian scattering can not be explained within the standard framework . in   [ shells ] we demonstrate that such scattering may be explained if it is produced in thin shells  the ionized boundaries of molecular regions ( clouds ) .",
    "a typical value for the photon flux of ionizing interstellar radiation ( @xmath114 ) through a unit surface can be estimated by converting the standard habing flux @xcite of dissociating photons ( @xmath115 ) using a blackbody spectrum of temperature @xmath116 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this gives @xmath117 . in the vicinity of a bright star the ionizing flux can be several orders of magnitude higher . for example , at a distance of @xmath118 from a star emitting @xmath119 ionizing photons",
    "@xmath8 , this flux is @xmath120 .",
    "the mean free path of an ionizing photon that penetrates a neutral medium of density @xmath121 is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the hydrogen ionization cross section at the threshold energy @xmath124 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    when a homogeneous molecular cloud is irradiated by an ionizing photon flux  @xmath125 it develops an ionized `` skin '' whose width @xmath126 can be found from the ionization balance condition @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the recombination coefficient ( @xmath129 for @xmath130 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . for @xmath131 and",
    "@xmath132 one finds @xmath133 , which can be taken as the thickness of the ionized boundary .",
    "the width of the transition layer between the ionized skin and the neutral interior of the cloud is of the order of @xmath134 ( @xmath135 for the adopted value of @xmath121 ) .",
    "[ tbp ]    we now demonstrate that thin scattering shells ( representing the ionized boundaries of molecular clouds ) can produce non - gaussian scintillations even if they are not turbulent .",
    "in particular , we show that scattering by thin curved layers ( which we represent for simplicity as thin spherical shells ) produces a power - law distribution of the scattering angles .",
    "most remarkably , the derived power - law index coincides with the value originally inferred by @xcite from an interpretation of the scintillation data in terms of the lvy theory ( see   [ motivation ] and [ difference ] ) .",
    "the agreement with the observations suggests that a shell - like structure is a general feature of the ionized scattering regions in the interstellar medium .    to derive these results",
    ", we assume that each of the electron - scattering regions has the form of a thin spherical shell of radius  @xmath136 and thickness  @xmath137 ( see fig .",

    "we denote by @xmath138 the electron - density excess in the shell relative to its surroundings and employ geometric optics to calculate the angular deviation @xmath26 experienced by a ray that intercepts the shell at a distance  @xmath139 from the center . for a typical density excess @xmath140",
    "this deviation is very small , @xmath141 , so the trajectory of the ray through the scattering region can be approximated by a straight line .",

    "we note , however , that to calculate the total probability distribution function of the angular deviation @xmath64 one needs to convolve the distribution @xmath159 ( which was obtained for a boundary of given curvature and density ) with the curvature radii and density distributions of real clouds .",

    "* ) , is conservative in that it leads to a lower bound on @xmath176 .",
    "all in all , we expect that integrating the expression ( [ p_dtheta ] ) over a cloud distribution would have little effect on the derived asymptotic form of @xmath159 and , in particular , would not change the inferred value of its power - law exponent .",
    "it is interesting to consider some observational implications of the proposed model . as we established in this section , @xmath179 . on the other hand , from ",
    "[ difference ] we know that when the scattering angles have a lvy distribution with @xmath180 , the number of scattering structures along the line of sight scales with the maximal deflection angle as @xmath181 .",

    "the overlap radius of radiatively cooled supernova shells ( within which dense clouds are envisioned to form ) in the @xcite model of the interstellar medium .",
    "the estimated number of scattering regions could in principle be smaller ( resulting in a weaker constraint on their separation ) since several independent scattering structures ( ionized boundaries ) might in practice form inside a single scattering region .",
    "the physical basis for the statistical properties of the thin , curved scattering structures in the proposed interpretation is their intermittent spatial distribution .",
    "specifically , the free electrons responsible for the scattering are envisioned to occupy only a small fraction of the interstellar medium  namely , the ionized boundaries of molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , the molecular clouds themselves are sparsely distributed in space , so the effects of two different clouds on wave propagation are uncorrelated .",
    "thus , a radio signal from a distant pulsar does not experience significant scattering over most of its propagation distance to earth .",
    "however , when its trajectory intersects a curved , ionized cloud boundary , the scattering may be strong . as discussed in  ",
    "[ difference ] , this behavior is characteristic of lvy - flight wave paths .",
    "the spatial intermittency in this scenario is distinct from the intermittent nature of turbulence that underlies the deviation angle statistics in the traditional interpretation of interstellar scintillations .",
    "in contrast with the traditional picture , the cumulative effect of many independent scatterings by different thin shells is not gaussian ( which can be understood formally from the fact that the central limit theorem does not apply to slowly declining distributions ) ; it is instead a lvy flight with @xmath61 , as implied by the observations ( see   [ motivation ] ) .",
    "the foregoing derivation of the statistical properties of scattering by thin shells is based exclusively on geometric considerations . if , however , the shells are turbulent , then the effects of turbulence need to be considered in conjunction with those of geometry .",
    "turbulence in the ionized boundary of a molecular cloud can be a natural consequence of the turbulent structure of the cloud itself or of the surrounding ionized medium .",
    "it is , however , difficult to construct a detailed model of how the turbulence is excited in the cloud or penetrates into it since the theory of compressible turbulence is still in its infancy .",
    "however , the spectrum of a homogeneous , compressible turbulence has been investigated in some detail and found to be close to the kolmogorov one @xcite .",
    "this should suffice for our qualitative estimate .",
    "we denote the outer scale of such a preexisting turbulence by @xmath185 .",
    "this value should not be confused with the outer scale of turbulence excited inside expanding hii regions , which we analyzed in   [ difference ] .",
    "we assume that the density fluctuations on this scale are @xmath186  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we neglect the interplay of turbulent fluctuations with the boundaries of the ionized shells .",
    "we consider the contribution of @xmath39  slabs of homogeneous turbulence , each of width @xmath187 , that lie along the line of sight .",
    "the integrated density fluctuations are given by an expression analogous to equation  ( [ caln ] ) , @xmath188 .",
    "when the interstellar ionizing radiation is not very strong ( @xmath189 ) , the boundaries are not fully ionized and ion - neutral collisions are important .",
    "one can assume that turbulent fluctuations are smoothed out below the collisional cutoff scale @xmath190 , which is assumed to be dominated by collisions with helium atoms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this estimate indicates that we can safely assume that the turbulence is predominantly in the inertial range ( with @xmath191 ) on the scales of interest to us .",
    "observations have revealed that the scaling of pulse broadening with dispersion measure changes from @xmath59 for distant pulsars to @xmath192 for nearby ones .",
    "the transition between the two scaling behaviors occurs at @xmath193 ( see , e.g. , fig . 4 in",
    "* ) and appears as an `` elbow '' in the @xmath38  vs.  @xmath60 diagram .",
    "this dispersion measure corresponds to a pulsar distance @xmath194 , which , by the arguments given in    [ difference ] , implies a density fluctuation scale @xmath195 .",
    "we propose that this change in the scaling behavior is a reflection of the fact that , for nearby pulsars , the scattering angle is small and the scattering is dominated by turbulence within the ionized cloud boundaries rather than by the shape of these boundaries . based on the arguments presented in   [ motivation ] , the correlation scale @xmath92 of transmitted waves due to turbulent fluctuations satisfies the condition @xmath196 . setting @xmath197 , @xmath131 , and @xmath198 , we infer a value of @xmath199 for the outer scale of the turbulence .",
    "it is gratifying to note that this estimate agrees with the value commonly attributed ( on both theoretical and observational grounds ) to the general interstellar medium ( ism ) turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of a strong turbulence inside the boundaries ( @xmath200 )",
    "it is conceivable that the properties of the turbulence itself may play a key role in establishing the non - gaussian nature of the scattering for distant pulsars ( the first scenario outlined in   [ introduction ] ) . in   [ origin ]",
    "we consider the possibility that molecular clouds that are situated in the vicinity of a bright star or near the galactic center ( so that @xmath200 ) may naturally develop turbulence that is strong and non - gaussian on small scales .",
    "we caution , however , that the properties of the envisioned turbulence are not yet well established .",
    "furthermore , to fully analyze this case , one needs to specify how the turbulence is generated and how it interacts with the boundaries of the ionized layer .",
    "the answer to both of these questions may depend on the particular mechanism of cloud formation , which may not be universal and which , in any case , is beyond the scope of the present discussion .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the robust and general conclusions that we reached in this section on the basis of purely geometric arguments , the results we obtain in   [ origin ] are at this point still tentative .",
    "we consider only the extreme case , when a bright star is turned on very close to ( or , alternatively , inside ) a molecular cloud . in this case",
    "the surrounding gas gets ionized up to the strmgren radius , @xmath201 , which can be evaluated from the ionization balance condition @xmath202 ( where , again , @xmath203 is the density of ionized gas , @xmath128 is the recombination coefficient , and spherical symmetry is assumed for simplicity ) . during the initial phase of fast ionization the gas density does not change ( @xmath204 ) and one obtains @xmath205 for @xmath206 , which for @xmath131 yields @xmath9 .",
    "the duration of the fast ionization phase is @xmath207 from the turn - on time of the ionization source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pressure imbalance between the gas inside the strmgren sphere ( which is rapidly heated to @xmath208 ) and the surrounding cold molecular gas ( @xmath209 ) then leads to an expansion of the ionized region , which proceeds at approximately the sonic speed @xmath109 .",
    "this `` intermediate '' ( or sonic expansion ) phase lasts for @xmath210 , until pressure balance with the ambient gas is restored at the final phase of the h ii region s evolution .",
    "[ tbp ]    as the lifetime of the ionizing star is typically @xmath211 , only the intermediate phase is relevant in practice .",
    "this phase nominally starts when the ionizing flux that reaches the boundary of the hii region drops below the critical value @xmath212 .",
    "after this time a hydrodynamic shock forms ahead of the ionization front ( if )",
    ". this shock compresses the neutral gas to a density @xmath213 such that a weak d - type if is set up  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this configuration ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ if ] ) the speed of the if with respect to the compressed gas is smaller than the d - critical speed @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the sound speed in the neutral gas . this is equivalent to the condition @xmath216 , which implies that the neutral gas is compressed to @xmath217 , which is @xmath218 for @xmath219 .    in the limit when the relative speed of the if and the compressed gas equals @xmath220 , the ionized gas flows out of the front at the sound speed @xmath14 .",
    "since this is also roughly the speed at which the front propagates into the ( stationary ) ambient gas , one can argue that the front should always be close to the d - critical state @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , when the ionizing flux reaching the front drops below its d - critical value , the density of the ionized gas behind the moving front drops too .",
    "since the photon absorption is proportional to @xmath221 , this would lead to an increase in the flux reaching the if , which would turn it back into a d - critical front .",
    "modeling and numerical simulations confirm that the speed of the ionized gas leaving the if is indeed near sonic , or possibly smaller by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "weak or critical d - type ifs are subject to an instability with a linear growth rate @xmath222 ( for perturbations with wavenumber @xmath223 ) , so the shortest modes initially have the fastest growth @xcite .",
    "the range of scales of unstable perturbations in real fronts is limited at the lower end by the front s width @xmath224 , which is @xmath225 in the case we consider , and at the upper end by the recombination length @xmath226 , which for our fiducial parameters is @xmath227 .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite have confirmed that this instability indeed develops and evolves into the nonlinear regime .",
    "it was found that an unstable if becomes rough , with the perturbation wavelength and the perturbation amplitude saturating below the recombination length .",
    "we conjecture ( following the original speculation by @xcite ) that the if instability would generate strong small - scale turbulence .",
    "one can , in fact , argue quite generally that , in analogy with a flow through a grid , a large  reynolds - number outflow from a rough surface should be turbulent .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite have indeed revealed the existence of large velocity shears on small scales , but the resolution of these experiments was not high enough to study the details of the indicated fine - scale structures .",
    "we note , however , that a compressible flow converging on a scale @xmath228 will in general create density fluctuations of the order @xmath229 on the same scale . for the near - sonic conditions characterizing the downstream",
    "if flow , the density fluctuations could thus be close to ( within a factor of a few of ) @xmath203 . a schematic picture of the envisioned turbulence is shown in figure  [ if ] .",
    "we propose that the turbulence likely excited behind ifs that propagate into strongly ionized clouds could generate the small - scale density perturbations inferred in the lvy model of interstellar scintillations .",
    "a strong ionizing flux gives rise to a d - type front that produces a significant compression of the upstream neutral gas , and this in turn leads to a sufficiently large value of the ratio @xmath230 for the turbulence to develop .",
    "( as we estimated in   [ shells ] , the ratio of the thickness of the ionized skin of a molecular cloud to the mean free path of an ionizing photon is only @xmath231 in the case of the typical interstellar flux @xmath232 . )",
    "the estimated outer scale of this turbulence , @xmath233 , is much smaller than the @xmath234 scale that characterizes the turbulent h ii regions invoked in the standard interpretation of interstellar scintillations ( see   [ difference ] ) . however ,",
    "if ( as can be plausibly expected ) the magnitude of the velocity fluctuations on the outer scale is @xmath235 also in this case then the perturbations should be much stronger on the scales @xmath236 of interest . furthermore ,",
    "in the present interpretation the turnover time of the largest eddies ( @xmath237 ) is typically shorter than the cooling time @xmath238 , and since the ratio of the turnover time to the cooling time decreases with the eddy scale , the difficulty associated with the expected damping of the compressible and entropy modes when these two times become comparable ( see   [ introduction ] ) would be avoided .    to illustrate the above points , we estimate the expected density fluctuation on the small scale @xmath239 .",
    "the density fluctuations at the outer scale are @xmath240 . assuming a kolmogorov scaling ( as proposed in the @xcite turbulent cascade model ) , @xmath241 . adopting an outer scale of @xmath242 ( for which radiative damping should be unimportant ) , we infer @xmath243 . for comparison ,",
    "the value obtained by adopting @xmath24 is a factor of @xmath244 smaller , and , even more significantly , in the latter case the fluctuation might be strongly damped by radiative cooling .    in the proposed picture turbulence",
    "is continuously regenerated in the layer ( of width @xmath245 ) behind the if .",
    "the energy comes from the ionizing radiation and is deposited into fluctuating streams of hot gas that leave the rough surface of the front . without such regeneration , turbulence would decay on the relatively short crossing time  @xmath246 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the outer scale of this turbulence in not the effective strmgren radius ( i.e. , the thickness of the ionized cloud boundary ) , as is sometimes assumed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but rather the recombination length in the ionized gas , which is much shorter .    to account for the inferred non - gaussian nature of the density fluctuations we make a connection with the fact that in the lvy - flight interpretation the fluctuations responsible for the observed radio - pulse broadening span a narrow range of scales , @xmath247 ( see   [ difference ] ) , which is close to the estimated scale of the proton gyroradius @xmath16 in the ionized regions of molecular clouds ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "now , the turbulent mhd cascade discussed above corresponds to shear alfvn waves only on scales @xmath248 . on scales that approach",
    "the ion gyroradius the alfvn waves become kinetic and develop an electric field component that is parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the electrons , as the most mobile particles , rapidly respond to this field by moving along the magnetic field lines in the direction of increasing electric potential .",
    "this provides a mechanism for coupling density fluctuations in the plasma to the cascade of shear alfvn waves .",
    "one can show that the coupling is strongest for transverse wavenumbers @xmath249 satisfying @xmath250 and that the fourier amplitude of the induced density fluctuations may be estimated from @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the fluctuating electric potential , @xmath253 is the temperature , and @xmath254 is boltzmann s constant  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the above coupling mechanism provides yet another means of accounting for the inferred presence of strong density fluctuations on small scales .",
    "even more significant , however , is the fact that , as the ion gyroradius scale is approached , the turbulence itself gets modified .",
    "this happens because in the presence of relatively strong electron density fluctuations and of the corresponding perpendicular electric field ( see the above estimate of @xmath255 ) , the ion polarization drift velocity becomes comparable to the velocity of fluid fluctuations , and so ions can drift compressively across the magnetic field lines .",
    "this leads to the coupling of density fluctuations to the alfvnic fluctuations ; a similar effect is at work in the so - called electromagnetic drift wave ( or drift alfvn ) turbulence , which has been investigated in the context of plasma fusion devices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , numerical simulations of such turbulence have revealed a rather high level of density fluctuations ( in equipartition with kinetic fluctuations ) and statistical properties that are clearly non - gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the basis of the foregoing results one could plausibly attribute the generation of strong , non - gaussian density fluctuations in turbulent , ionized molecular gas to the onset of compressive effects in a shear alfvn wave cascade that approaches the proton gyroradius scale .",
    "( as we discussed at the beginning of this section , if instability at the boundaries of molecular clouds provides a likely mechanism for generating such turbulence that might by itself produce strong fluctuations on small scales . )",
    "more definitive statements must , however , await further studies of this turbulence in an explicitly astrophysical context . in the meantime",
    "one could perhaps look for a signature of the compressive effects in the density spectrum inferred from the pulsar scintillations data on scales @xmath256 .",
    "a likely signature would be a flattening of the spectrum on these scales : a flattening of this type was observed in the electron density spectrum of the solar wind @xcite , where it was , in fact , attributed to kinetic alfvn wave effects @xcite .",
    "to conclude our discussion , we recapitulate the main ideas and results of this work .",
    "we have been motivated by a recent comparison of radio signals from distant pulsars with an analytical model @xcite , from which a non - gaussian power - law distribution of wave - scattering angles was inferred ( corresponding to lvy statistics ) .",
    "it was also deduced that the density fluctuations responsible for this scattering should be rather strong on small scales ( @xmath257 ; see   [ difference ] ) .",
    "these conclusions differ from the predictions of the classical theory of scintillations , which are based on gaussian statistics .",
    "the inferred non - gaussian behavior of the scattering process indicates that the scattering medium has a different structure than the one envisioned in the standard model , where the angular deviations are attributed to the cumulative effect of a large number of weak - scattering events along the line of sight .",
    "in contrast , we propose in this paper that the observed scintillations are dominated by rare scattering events in spatially intermittent density structures .",
    "we identify these structures with thin and curved layers of ionized gas , which could plausibly be the ionized boundaries of molecular clouds . in this picture",
    ", a ray propagating from a distant pulsar can experience significant scattering only when its trajectory intersects such a boundary .",
    "the angular deviation induced during such an encounter can be rather large , so a single scattering event may dominate the total angular deflection .",
    "the trajectory of the ray therefore has the character of a lvy flight .    for a simple calculation , we modeled the ionized cloud boundaries as thin spherical shells .",
    "we found that the scattering - angle probability density function predicted by this model has the asymptotic form @xmath258 for large angular deviations ( see   [ shells ] ) .",
    "remarkably , this is precisely the form predicted by @xcite on the basis of a comparison of the lvy model with observations .",
    "our analysis therefore strongly suggests that the scattering structures in the interstellar medium are likely to possess a shell - like morphology .",
    "the spatially intermittent nature of the electron - density distribution is an important ingredient of our theory .",
    "so far , analytical and numerical investigations of interstellar turbulence were mostly restricted to homogeneous settings with periodic ( or otherwise simplified ) boundary conditions .",
    "however , the actual interstellar electron density distribution is not homogeneous , and geometric boundaries of scattering regions can play a dominant role in the line - of - sight integrated density fluctuations .",
    "such boundary effects have been observed in aero - optical experiments , in which an optical beam propagated through a confined turbulent region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distant - pulsar relationship @xmath259 between the pulse time delay and the pulsar dispersion measure , for which the above model provides a natural explanation , is observed to change in nearby pulsars to @xmath260 , the expected scaling for gaussian turbulence .",
    "we have interpreted this change as a consequence of the fact that , for nearby pulsars , the scattering is dominated by turbulence within the ionized cloud boundaries rather than by the shape of these boundaries .",
    "we have found that the measured value of the transition @xmath60 ( @xmath261 ) is consistent with the inferred value ( @xmath262 ) of the outer scale of the general ism turbulence .",
    "although , as we just summarized , the non - gaussian , lvy - type statistics of scattering angles may have a purely geometric origin , we also discussed ( see   [ origin ] ) the situation in which the scattering regions are strongly turbulent , so that the contribution from turbulent density fluctuations dominates the scattering .",
    "this may happen when a molecular cloud boundary is ionized by radiation from nearby stars or by strong interstellar radiation in the vicinity of the galactic center . in this case",
    "a near - critical d - type ionization front develops and propagates into the cloud .",
    "ionization fronts of this type are known to be linearly unstable . in its nonlinear phase",
    ", this instability could lead to a strong turbulence on scales below the recombination length @xmath263 and above the ionization front thickness @xmath264 ( where the numerical values correspond to a cloud of density @xmath265 ) .",
    "the outer scale of this turbulence is @xmath266 , so the density fluctuations could be strong enough on small scales to produce the inferred scattering .",
    "we contrast this situation with the standard theory , where the outer scale of turbulence is of the order of the strmgren radius of an h ii region ( @xmath267 ) . in this case the density is passively advected by the alfvnic cascade from the large outer scale to the small dissipative one .",
    "this cascade has to pass through the radiative cooling scale ( @xmath268 ) , where the density fluctuations could be significantly attenuated , so by the time it reaches the much smaller scales implicated in the scattering process the turbulence might be too weak to account for the observed scintillations . in the case of a turbulent ionization front the outer scale of turbulence is smaller than the cooling scale and this problem is avoided .",
    "we also noted that the small scales implied by the non - gaussian interpretation happen to be close to the ion gyroscale in an ionized molecular cloud .",
    "the turbulent cascade would become compressible on these scales because of kinetic effects , with the density fluctuations becoming coupled to the alfvnic ones .",
    "this is expected to produce a flattening of the density spectrum in this range , providing an alternative means of accounting for the relative strength of the fluctuations on small scales .",
    "even more tantalizingly for our contemplated application , there have been indications from numerical simulations for a clearly non - gaussian behavior of the fluctuations in this case .",
    "however , as neither the nonlinear development of the ionization front instability nor the behavior of kinetic alfvn turbulence in astrophysical contexts have yet been studied in detail , our discussion of the properties of turbulent scattering layers must be regarded as tentative at this stage .",
