    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is a simple , robust and efficient technique for complete population transfer ( cpt ) in three - state quantum systems @xcite . in this technique , the population is transferred adiabatically in a raman transition , from an initially populated state @xmath0 via an intermediate state @xmath1 to a target state @xmath2 by two pulsed fields , pump and stokes , whose frequencies are maintained on two - photon resonance between states @xmath0 and @xmath2 . if the pulses are ordered counterintuitively , the stokes before the pump , then the dark state is associated with state @xmath0 initially and state @xmath2 in the end , thus providing an adiabatic route from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "a unique and remarkable feature of stirap is that during the transfer the population remains trapped in a dark state , which is a time - dependent coherent superposition of states @xmath0 and @xmath2 only and does not involve the intermediate state @xmath1 .",
    "state @xmath1 therefore remains unpopulated during the transfer and its properties , including possible population decay , are largely irrelevant for stirap .",
    "a very large detuning @xcite or loss rate @xcite , however , do affect stirap and reduce its transfer efficiency .",
    "the simplicity , efficiency , and robustness of stirap have attracted much attention , which has resulted in numerous applications in a variety of quantum systems . among them , we mention population transfer via a continuum , wherein the discrete intermediate state @xmath1 is replaced by an ionization continuum @xcite . because a dark state that links adiabatically states @xmath0 and @xmath2 still forms , high transfer efficiency is still possible . however , various specific features of the continuum that make it substantially different from a discrete state ( or a manifold of discrete states ) reduce the transfer efficiency .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to reduce the effects of these continuum features , resulting in increase of the transfer efficiency well above 50% .",
    "stirap via continuum has recently been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the extension of stirap to include an initial or final continuum was at first investigated for the photoassociation process producing cold molecules starting from laser - cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "photoassociation is based on the laser - driven transitions of a continuum - bound - bound system .",
    "et al _ @xcite have extended the stirap technique to the cases of initial or final continuum , proving that transfer with a good efficiency is possible .",
    "the quantum transfer in a three - level system based on bound - bound - continuum transitions arises also in the ionization of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "ionization of a rubidium bec from the ground state through a two - photon ionization ( tpi ) scheme was explored experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .    in the present paper , we follow this latter idea and introduce a continuum in stirap by replacing the final state @xmath2 by a continuum .",
    "the objective , compared to stirap _ via _ a continuum , is also changed drastically : instead of trying to _ avoid _ ionization , here we aim at _ maximizing _ ionization . as in stirap we also aim at minimizing the transient population of the intermediate state @xmath1 , in order to avoid ( possibly strong ) decay to other discrete states via spontaneous emission or unwanted excitation to other states .",
    "states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are linked by a pump pulse , and state @xmath1 is connected to the continuum by an ionizing pulse , with the ionizing pulse arriving before the pump .",
    "the challenge here is that , unlike stirap _ via _ continuum , a dark state can not be formed between the initial state @xmath0 and the continuum states , because a flat continuum is an incoherent medium .    to this end",
    ", we propose to use a laser - induced continuum structure ( lics ) @xcite created in the continuum by embedding an ancillary , control state @xmath3 into the continuum by a third , control laser .",
    "this lics creates some coherence into the continuum , which makes it possible to create a _ quasi - dark _ state , and thence a stirap - like process into the continuum .",
    "this lics - stirap allows us to produce almost complete ionization , with negligibly small population losses from state @xmath1 , even when the @xmath1 lifetime is much shorter than the interaction duration .",
    "experimental verification of this lics - stirap technique will open opportunities for many applications , for instance efficient photoionization of a bec without atomic excitation in intermediate atomic states that will improve the ion production obtained in the experiment of ref .",
    "in addition , an increase in the ionization efficiency for cold atoms will improve the brightness in magneto - optical - trap based sources producing either electron @xcite or ion @xcite beams .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : c - stirap ] we define the problem and show that a counterintuitive pulse order of the pump and ionizing pulses suppresses fluorescence and is favourable for ionization , even without a control laser . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lics - stirap ] we add lics to the scenario and derive a very accurate analytic approximation to describe this lics - stirap technique .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] provides illustrations of the proposed ionization technique and comparison of the analytical and numerical results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] presents a summary .",
    "we first consider tpi of an atom , initially in state @xmath0 , coupled to the ionization continuum via state @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - stirap ] .",
    "the transition 1 - 2 is driven by a pump laser pulse with rabi frequency @xmath4 and detuning @xmath5 , and state @xmath1 is connected to the continuum by a second laser pulse with a time - dependent rate @xmath6 .",
    "state @xmath1 can decay irreversibly via spontaneous emission ( or other mechanisms ) to other states with a constant rate @xmath7 ; we shall refer to the respective signal as the _ fluorescence signal _ , f=_-^p_2(t)dt .",
    "[ fluorescence ] the ionization signal is i=1-p_1()-p_2()-f , [ ionization ] where @xmath8 are the populations of the discrete states ( @xmath9 ) . our objective is to set up the laser pulses such that the ionization signal @xmath10 is maximized , while the fluorescence signal @xmath11 is minimal .",
    "is coupled to another discrete state @xmath1 by a resonant , or nearly resonant , pump laser field .",
    "state @xmath1 is coupled to the ionization continuum by a second , ionizing laser pulse .",

    "this objective reminds one of stirap .",
    "the significant difference here is that state @xmath2 is replaced by a continuum .",
    "the equation that describes the dynamics of the system ( in units @xmath13 ) is the schrdinger equation , i(t ) = ( t ) ( t ) .",
    "[ schroedinger ] here @xmath14^{t}$ ] is the column - vector with the probability amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 of states @xmath0 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the hamiltonian , obtained by adiabatic elimination of the continuum states and within the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite , ( t ) = 12 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the stark shifts of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , produced by virtual excitation to other atomic states .",
    "we are interested in situations when the ionization signal @xmath10 is large , i.e. in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "this implies large peak rabi frequency @xmath4 and large ionization rate @xmath21 . because we also assume that the loss rate @xmath22 is fixed and large , @xmath23 , state @xmath1 is subjected to strong population decay , due to both spontaneous emission and ionization .",
    "this implies that it receives very little transient population and can therefore be eliminated adiabatically .",
    "hence we find after simple algebra [ p1p2-ae]p_1(t ) & & , [ p1(t ) ] + p_2(t ) & & p_1(t ) , [ p2(t ) ] with @xmath24 .",
    "now we use these formulas to examine the possibilities of how to minimize fluorescence @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath25 , and simultaneously maximize ionization @xmath10 .",
    "the first choice is to use a _ large detuning _",
    "@xmath5 . indeed",
    ", this will reduce the population of state @xmath1 , because @xmath26 for large @xmath5 [ see eq . ] ; however , this decrease will be accompanied by an increase in the population of state @xmath0 , see eq . .",
    "in result , the increase in the ionization will be little , if any .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the stark shift @xmath27 , which can be induced by the ionizing laser , or , if needed , by an additional far - off - resonance laser , as in scrap technique @xcite .",
    "a straightforward alternative is to increase the magnitude of the ionizing pulse @xmath28 alone . then the population ( [ p2(t ) ] ) of state @xmath1 decreases as @xmath29 , as vs @xmath30 ; however , the increase in the population ( [ p1(t ) ] ) of state @xmath0 is smaller vs @xmath31 than vs @xmath30 . in result ,",
    "the ionization signal will increase more markedly when increasing @xmath31 .     as a function of the delay of the ionizing pulse @xmath32 and the pump detuning @xmath33 .",
    "the pulses have gaussian shapes , eqs .",
    ". the decay rate from state @xmath1 is @xmath34 , the peak ionization rate is @xmath35 , the peak rabi frequency is @xmath36 , and the stark shift is @xmath37.,width=245 ]    a closer inspection of eqs .",
    "suggests that one can decrease @xmath38 , without increasing @xmath39 ( implying thence a net increase of the ionization @xmath10 ) , by delaying the pump pulse @xmath40 with respect to the ionizing pulse @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , it is obvious that the pump pulse @xmath4 must not arrive _ before _ the ionizing pulse @xmath41 , because then the fluorescence will deplete the population even before ionization has the chance to begin ; mathematically , this implies large values for the fractions in eqs . , with resulting small population of state @xmath0 and large fluorescence signal @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , if the pump pulse @xmath4 arrives simultaneously , or _",
    "after _ the ionizing pulse @xmath28 , with some overlap , then fluorescence can only begin simultaneously with ionization . moreover , if during the ionization the ratio @xmath42 is very small , while the ratio @xmath43 is moderately large compared to @xmath44 , then both @xmath39 and @xmath38 will remain small , as easily seen from eqs . when @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , our objective of producing ionization without excitation requires that during the population depletion we have ( t)^2 t ( t ) .",

    "the pulses have gaussian shapes , eqs . .",
    "the pump detuning is @xmath33 , the decay rate from state @xmath1 is @xmath48 , the peak rabi frequency is @xmath36 , and the stark shift is @xmath37.,width=245 ]    these conclusions are illustrated in figs .",

    "figure [ fig : td ] demonstrates also that the detuning @xmath5 is of little help in respect to ionization , as predicted by eqs . .",
    "as follows from the above analysis , counterintuitive pulse order increases ionization and suppresses excitation .",
    "however , very strong ionizing laser is needed to ensure the conditions . in the following section",
    "we shall show that a lics in the continuum can help ionization and make this process very similar to stirap because of the creation of a quasi - dark state between state @xmath0 and the lics , with ensuing nearly complete ionization with moderate laser resources .",
    "the additional discrete state @xmath3 is embedded into the continuum by a control laser field , which creates a lics in the continuum.,height=302 ]    let us assume now that , in addition to the scheme in fig .",

    "given the preceding assumption for @xmath67 it is clear that the ionizing laser @xmath63 will ionize also state @xmath3 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "however , because from state @xmath3 the ionizing laser points deeply into the continuum this ionization rate is small ; moreover , as state @xmath3 remains largely unpopulated , this ionization channel ( which is actually favorable for our goal of maximizing ionization ) does not alter the dynamics markedly .",

    "we have already come to the conclusion that the pump and ionizing pulses must arrive in a counterintuitive order : ionizing before pump .",
    "the optimal timing of the control pulse can be deduced from the following arguments .",
    "because the objective is ionization , we must avoid population transfer via the continuum into state @xmath3 , which will occur if the control pulse precedes the ionizing pulse @xcite ; the control should therefore be applied after the ionizing pulse .",
    "the timing of the control pulse with respect to the pump pulse is not so significant but these pulses should not be separated too much because it is obvious that , for lics to have any effect , the control pulse must overlap significantly with the pump and ionizing pulses . we therefore conclude that for maximal ionization , the pulses should be applied in the order _ ionizing - control - pump _ , with a sufficient overlap between them .",

    "when @xmath50 is too large , a very large atomic coherence is created through the continuum , so that state @xmath3 is directly involved in the dynamics , with some atomic population transfered to this state .",
    "we have demonstrated , using analytical techniques and numerical simulations , that stirap can be used as a tool for efficient ionization of the population of a discrete state @xmath0 coupled to a continuum via a lossy state @xmath1 .",
    "the ionizing laser must precede the pump laser coupling states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and both lasers must be strong enough to enforce adiabatic evolution .",
    "the ionization probability is further enhanced when a lics is created into the continuum and stirap is directed into this lics because then a quasi - dark state composed of state @xmath0 and the lics is created , via which the population flows into the continuum .",
    "we have shown that almost complete ionization can be achieved even when the lifetime of the resonantly coupled state @xmath1 is much shorter than the laser interaction duration .",
    "we have also shown that in the adiabatic limit , the main population dynamics takes place during the rising edge of the pump pulse , when it is lost irreversibly either via ionization or fluorescence .",
    "hence in lics - stirap only the order in which the pulses arrive is important , a result significantly different from conventional stirap between discrete levels , where the order of the pulse terminations is also very important .",
    "experimental verification of these results will open opportunities for many applications , such as photoionization of ultracold atoms with efficiency close to unity and negligible population into intermediate discrete states .",
    "it should be noticed that lics - strap relies on atomic structures in the continuum reached by appropriate laser sources .",
    "an accurate examination of the atoms listed above and their experimental investigation shows that sodium is particularly suitable for experimental verification of the proposed technique .",

    "<S> we propose a technique , which produces nearly complete ionization of the population of a discrete state , coupled to a continuum by a two - photon transition via a lossy intermediate state , whose lifetime is much shorter than the interaction duration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using counterintuitively ordered pulses , as in stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , wherein the pulse coupling the intermediate state to the continuum precedes and partly overlaps the pulse coupling the initial and intermediate states , greatly increases the ionization signal and strongly reduces the population loss due to spontaneous emission through the lossy state . for strong spontaneous emission from that state , </S>",
    "<S> however , the ionization is never complete because the dark state required for stirap does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this drawback can be eliminated almost completely by creating a laser - induced continuum structure ( lics ) by embedding a third discrete state into the continuum with a third , control laser . </S>",
    "<S> this lics introduces some coherence into the continuum , which enables a stirap - like population transfer into the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> a highly accurate analytic description is developed and numerical results are presented for gaussian pulse shapes . </S>"
