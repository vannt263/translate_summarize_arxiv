    "networks of neurons which undergo `` spiky '' dynamics have been thoroughly investigated ( see e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , a theory which describes the dynamics of randomly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons is still lacking .",
    "even a system composed exclusively of inhibitory neurons@xcite appears too complicated for analytical approaches .",
    "part of the reason for this is that the dynamics of a single neuron involves many physiological features across a wide range of time scales that are difficult to incorporate into an analytical theory .",
    "our goal in this work is to describe some of the dynamical features of a purely inhibitory neural network within the framework of a minimalist model .",
    "while we sacrifice realism by this approach , our model is analytically tractable .",
    "this feature offers the possibility that more realistic networks may be treated by natural extensions of our general framework .",
    "we specifically investigate an integrate - and - fire neural network , in which the integration step is purely linear in time , and in which there exists only inhibitory and instantaneous coupling between interacting neurons .",
    "we thus ignore potentially important features such as voltage leakage during the integration , as well as heterogeneity in the external drive and in the network couplings .",
    "however , we do _ not _ assume all - to - all coupling , an unrealistic construction which is often invoked as a simplifying assumption .",
    "instead , the ( average ) number of `` neighbors '' is a basic parameter of our model .",
    "analytically , we consider _ annealed _ coupling , where the neighbors of a neuron are reassigned after each neuron firing event .",
    "however , our simulations indicate that the model with _ quenched _ coupling , where the neighbors of each neuron are fixed for all time , gives nearly identical results .",
    "each integrate - and - fire neuron is represented by a single variable  the polarization level , or voltage @xmath3 .",
    "our model has two fundamental ingredients : ( i ) the dynamics of individual neurons , and ( ii ) the interaction between them . for the former , we employ deterministic integrate - and - fire dynamics , in which the voltage on a single neuron increases linearly with time until a specified threshold is reached@xcite .",
    "at this point the neuron suddenly fires by emitting an action potential and the neuronal voltage quickly returns to a reference level ( fig .  [ if ] ) . for concreteness and without loss of generality , we assume the rate of voltage increase and the threshold voltage are both equal to 1 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath3 is instantaneously set to zero after firing , _",
    "i.  e. _ , we neglect delays in signal transmission between neurons@xcite .",
    "= 2.3in0.2 in 0.15 in    the meaning of the inhibition is illustrated in fig .",
    "when a given neuron fires , it instantaneously transmits an inhibitory action potential to @xmath0 randomly - chosen neighbors whose voltages are each reduced by an amount @xmath1 .",
    "this inhibition delays the time until these inhibited neurons can reach threshold and ultimately fire themselves .",
    "the neighbors of a given neuron are selected at random from among all the neurons in the network and they are chosen anew every time any neuron fires .",
    "thus the coupling in the network is annealed . while a network with fixed quenched coupling is biologically much more realistic , annealed coupling means that a rate equation provides the exact description of the dynamics .",
    "fortunately , the annealed and quenched systems appear to be statistically identical when the number of inhibitory - coupled neurons is sufficiently large .",
    "we shall consider only this limit in what follows .    within the rate equation approach ,",
    "the distribution of neuronal voltages in our inhibitory network is described by linear dynamics except at the isolated times when a neuron fires .",
    "the underlying rate equation admits a steady state voltage distribution whose basic properties are established analytically in sec .",
    "ii . in general",
    ", although the network has a steady response , the dynamics of an individual neuron has an interesting history between firing events .",
    "we study , in particular , the probability that a neuron `` survives '' up to a time @xmath4 after its last firing event in sec .",
    "the survival probability decays exponentially in time with a decay rate that depends on the competition between the integration and the inhibitory coupling .",
    "this provides a relatively complete picture of the dynamics of a single neuron in the network .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "iv and some identities are proven in the appendix .",
    "for the rate equation description we assume that the number of neurons is large and thus a continuum approach is appropriate .",
    "we define @xmath5 as the fraction of neurons whose voltage lies in the interval @xmath6 .",
    "then the probability density @xmath7 obeys the master equation , @xmath8,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 . the second term on left - hand side accounts for the voltage increase because of the deterministic integration . the first term on the right - hand side accounts for the increase of zero - voltage neurons due to the firing of other neurons which have reached the threshold value @xmath10 .",
    "the second set of terms accounts for the change in @xmath11 due to the processes where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( we assume @xmath14 since inhibitory neurons are being considered ) .    in the steady state ,",

    ", we first note that @xmath19 due to normalization . combining this with eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) , we obtain @xmath20 thus completing the solution .",

    "essentially identical results are obtained for quenched inter - neuron coupling but all other system parameters unchanged . after approximately one time unit ,",
    "the system has reached the steady state shown in the figure .",
    "other initial conditions merely have different time delays until the steady state is reached .",
    "in addition to the exponential decay of the distribution for the smallest voltages , there are several other noteworthy features .",
    "first , there is a linear decay of the distribution to its limiting value @xmath20 as @xmath31 from below ; this is reflective of the absorbing boundary condition at @xmath32 .",
    "there is also a sharp peak at @xmath33 , corresponding to the continuous input of reset neurons . for small @xmath1",
    ", almost all voltages lie within the range @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of the bak - sneppen evolution model@xcite in which the `` fitnesses '' of most species lie within a finite target range , together with a small population of sub - threshold species .",
    "finally we note that eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) applies even when the number of neighbors for a given neuron is not fixed . in this case , @xmath0 may be interpreted as just the _ average _ number of interacting neighbors of a given neuron .",
    "therefore @xmath0 can be any positive real number .",
    "the voltage offset @xmath1 can also be heterogeneous , _",
    "e.  g. _ , distributed in a finite range with some density @xmath34 . with this generalization , the term @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ pv ] ) should be replaced by @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting equation is still solvable by the same laplace transform technique as in the homogeneous network and we now obtain a similar solution to that in eq .",
    "( [ psol ] ) but with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the steady - state voltage distribution @xmath11 , we study the time dependence of an individual `` tagged '' neuron in the steady state .",
    "consider , for example , a neuron which last fired at time @xmath39 which we set to 0 for simplicity .",
    "the fate of this neuron may be generally characterized by its survival probability @xmath40 , defined as the probability that this neuron has not yet fired again during the time interval @xmath41 , irrespective of how many inhibitory inputs it may have received ( fig .  [ tagged ] ) .",
    "a more comprehensive description is provided by @xmath42 , the probability that the tagged neuron has not yet fired and that it received @xmath43 inhibitory inputs during @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , @xmath45 .",
    "as we now show , the survival probability and @xmath42 exhibit non - trivial first - passage characteristics .    before discussing the survival probability in detail ,",
    "let us first understand why a tagged neuron must eventually fire and why the survival probability decays exponentially at long times . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the voltage of a neuron increases deterministically with rate 1 . on the other hand , inhibitory spikes ,",
    "each of which reduce the voltage by @xmath1 , occur stochastically with rate @xmath46 .",
    "this gives @xmath47 for the rate at which the voltage decreases due to inhibition .",
    "thus , on average the voltage increases at a _ net _",
    "rate @xmath48 .",
    "consequently the voltage of a tagged neuron must eventually reach the threshold and fire .",
    "= 2.35in0.4 in 0.25 in    = 3.0in0.0 in 0.25 in    from the above argument , the mean lifetime @xmath49 of a neuron between firing events is just the inverse of this rate .",
    "thus @xmath50 notice that the density of neurons which are firing , @xmath51 , equals the inverse lifetime , as expected naively .",
    "since the evolution of the neuronal voltage is a random - walk - like process which is biased towards an absorbing boundary in a semi - infinite geometry , the neuron survival probability must decay exponentially with time@xcite , @xmath52    to understand the asymptotic behavior of @xmath40 , it is helpful to consider first the voltage evolution of a single neuron which has experienced @xmath53 inhibitory spikes .",
    "it is important to appreciate that a neuron which receives exactly @xmath43 spikes necessarily fires exactly at time @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ tagged ] ) .",
    "thus the survival probability is a piecewise constant function which changes discontinuously at @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we now determine the value of @xmath40 at each of these plateaux .",
    "when @xmath57 , the tagged neuron has no possibility of firing and @xmath58 . to survive until time @xmath59 , the neuron must receive at least one spike in the time interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "since neurons experience spikes at constant rate @xmath60 , the probability of the neuron receiving no spikes in @xmath30 $ ] is @xmath61 .",
    "the survival probability for @xmath62 thus equals @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ surv ] ) . similarly , to survive until time @xmath64",
    ", the neuron must receive one spike before @xmath65 and a second spike before @xmath59 . by writing the probabilities for each of these events , we find , after straightforward steps ,",
    "@xmath66 this direct approach becomes increasingly unwieldy for large times , however , and we now present a more systematic approach .    to this end , we first solve for @xmath42 , the probability that the tagged neuron has experienced @xmath43 inhibitory inputs but has not yet fired .",
    "for a constant rate @xmath67 of inhibitory spikes , the probability that the tagged neuron has been spiked exactly @xmath43 times , with each spike occurring in the time intervals @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath69 , equals @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 here the step function @xmath72 guarantees that the voltage of the tagged neuron is below the threshold at time @xmath4 .",
    "we must also ensure that the voltage is less than one throughout the entire time interval @xmath44 . the necessary and sufficient condition for this to occur is that the voltage is below threshold at each spike event .",
    "this determines the integration range in eq .",

    "consider first the range @xmath62 . here",
    "a tagged neuron which has not fired must have received at least one spike .",
    "consequently @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , if a neuron receives a single spike and survives until @xmath59 , the spike must have occurred in the time range @xmath30 $ ] .",

    "( [ q1 ] ) , we then find that @xmath89 in the time range @xmath62 .    generally in the time range @xmath90 , a tagged neuron which has not fired",

    "let us first use this survival probability to compute the average time interval @xmath49 between consecutive firings of the same neuron .",
    "this is @xmath118 in the first line , we use the fact that @xmath119 is just the probability that the neuron fires at a time @xmath4 after its previous firing , and the last line was derived by employing eq .",

    "equation ( [ tav ] ) agrees with this iff the identity @xmath121 holds .",
    "this is also verified in appendix .",
    "let us now interpret our results in the context of biological applications .",
    "typically , the number of neighboring neurons @xmath0 is large while the spike - induced voltage decrement @xmath1 of a neuron is small , so that the total voltage decrease @xmath122 is of order one . in other words",
    ", the limit @xmath123 appears biologically relevant . in this limit and",
    "when the time @xmath124 is large , the series for @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ sm ] ) is geometric .",
    "hence , apart from a prefactor , the survival probability is given by the first term in this series : @xmath126 using eqs .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ t ] ) , and stirling s formula , we deduce that @xmath40 decays exponentially with time , with the relaxation time in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) given by @xmath127    the different behavior of the two basic time scales , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , is characteristic of biased diffusion near an absorbing boundary in one dimension@xcite . here , the mean survival time is simply the distance from the particle to the absorbing boundary divided by the mean velocity @xmath130 . in contrast",
    ", the survival probability asymptotically decays as @xmath131 , so that @xmath132 , independent of initial distance .",
    "it is instructive to interpret these results for our neural network , where a single neuron can be viewed as undergoing a random walk in voltage , with a step to smaller voltage of magnitude @xmath1 occurring with probability @xmath133 in a time interval @xmath134 and a step to larger voltage of magnitude @xmath134 occurring with probability @xmath135 . for this random walk ,",

    "moreover , the diffusion coefficient of this random walk is simply @xmath138 .",
    "this random walk description should be valid when @xmath139 or @xmath140 , so that a tagged neuron experiences many spikes between firing events .",

    "we have determined both the steady state properties of the network , as well as the complete time - dependent behavior of a single neuron .",
    "the latter gives rise to an appealing first - passage problem for the probability for a neuron to survive a time @xmath4 after its last firing .",
    "this survival probability is piecewise constant but with an overall exponential decay in time .    given the simplicity of the model , it should be possible to incorporate some of the more important features of real inhibitory neural networks , such as neurons with leaky voltages and finite propagation velocity for inhibitory signals , into the rate equation description .",
