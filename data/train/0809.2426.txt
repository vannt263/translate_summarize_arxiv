    "supersymmetry is the unique non - trivial extension of the relativistic poincar symmetry of spacetime .",
    "it leads to field theories with improved ultraviolet behavior . because of this",
    ", supersymmetry might have direct relevance to particle physics through its stabilizing of the electroweak scale under radiative corrections .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the non - observation of supersymmetric particles means that supersymmetry manifests at low energies in softly broken form : only those supersymmetry breaking operators are allowed which do not introduce new types of divergences ( i.e.  higher than logarithmic ) .    among renormalizable operators",
    "there are only three types of soft supersymmetry breaking terms : the mass term for the lowest scalar component of a chiral superfield , the mass term for the lowest fermionic component of a vector superfield and the scalar trilinear and bilinear couplings . in the supersymmetric version of the standard model",
    ", the generic supersymmetry breaking sector contains a large number of new unknown parameters .",
    "consequently , the predictive power of the theory is compromised . furthermore , there are in general unacceptably large contributions to flavor changing neutral current processes due to the absence of a gim - like mechanism in the sector of scalar partners ( squarks ) of ordinary quarks . to avoid this problem the squark soft breaking masses must be degenerate with high accuracy , unlike the observed hierarchical structure of quark - lepton masses . to achieve universality in soft breaking masses",
    "is not an easy task .",
    "this typically requires rather complicated hidden and messenger sectors of supersymmetry breaking and , in many cases , special flavor symmetries also need to be postulated .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a conceptually different view of softly broken supersymmetric theories .",
    "namely , we define a field theory on superspace where the grassmannian coordinates are stochastic . with a suitably chosen probability distribution , to be defined below , the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters emerge upon averaging over the fluctuating superspace coordinates . at the classical level ,",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is parameterized through a single mass scale , @xmath0 , that describes the stochasticity of the grassmannian coordinates , and a very specific pattern of soft breaking terms emerges .",
    "namely , at tree - level , the @xmath1 parameter , the universal soft trilinear coupling @xmath2 , and the universal gaugino mass @xmath3 are given solely in terms of the stochasticity parameter @xmath0 , with no other arbitrary parameters involved .",
    "at the quantum level , these relations are imposed at a certain scale @xmath9 , which becomes a second free parameter .",
    "the soft scalar masses , zero at tree - level , are induced radiatively through the renormalization group equations at one - loop .",
    "the resulting pattern of supersymmetry breaking is highly desirable phenomenologically since it is capable of resolving the above - mentioned supersymmetric flavor problem and it is extremely predictive .",
    "most phenomenological studies of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model are done using explicit soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is understood that one eventually wants to derive the soft breaking parameters from a fundamental theory of spontaneous or dynamical supersymmetry breaking , and to have that theory simultaneously explain the special pattern of soft breaking terms required for agreement with experimental constraints ( degenerate squark masses , and so on ) .",
    "the idea of stochastic superspace coordinates lies conceptually somewhere in - between a full fundamental theory and pure phenomenological parameterization .",
    "it is much more specific than the latter , but it is not intended to be a fundamental theory either .",
    "our main point is that a certain line through the multi - dimensional parameter space of soft supersymmetry breaking turns out to be correlated with a non - trivial observation : it corresponds to the hypothesis that superspace coordinates fluctuate and thereby break supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , a section of this line produces phenomenologically realistic physics , and being so constrained it is ripe for experimental confirmation or falsification . if the lhc were to discover a supersymmetric particle spectrum in accord with the stochastic superspace relations , that would motivate a new perspective on the desired fundamental theory .",
    "that theory would have to produce fluctuating superspace coordinates at the effective low - energy level .",
    "we shall not speculate here as to what such a theory could be like .",
    "we begin at the beginning , namely phenomenology , and await the experimental results to come in the near future .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define stochastic superspace and as a warm up exercise compute soft breaking parameters in the simple interacting wess - zumino model . in the section 3",
    "we apply our formalism to the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we compute the low - energy soft breaking parameters using an approximate analytical solution to the renormalization group ( rg ) equations , and establish that this model is phenomenologically acceptable in a certain region of @xmath10 parameter space .",
    "we briefly mention possible extensions and then conclude .",
    "we consider n=1 8-dimensional superspace , with the grassmannian coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 being stochastic variables .",
    "one starts with the ordinary n=1 supersymmetric lagrangian density expressed in terms of superfields .",
    "the lagrangian density in ordinary spacetime is then defined as an average of the superspace lagrangian density over the different realizations of the stochastic grassmannian coordinates described by some probability distribution , @xmath13 .",
    "this probability distribution can be expanded as : @xmath14 where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are c - numbers , while @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are grassmann numbers .",
    "we demand that the probability measure ( [ 2 ] ) satisfy the following conditions :    1 .   the normalization condition : @xmath24 2 .   that all lorentz non - scalar moments vanish to ensure lorentz invariance : @xmath25 the non - vanishing moments are : @xmath26 where @xmath0 is a complex parameter of mass dimension .",
    "symmetry the phase of @xmath0 has no physical meaning and can be rotated away . below in numerical estimations we simply take @xmath0 to be real . ]    under these conditions we have the hermitian probability measure , @xmath27 for the stochastic grassmann variables .",
    "we shall use the dimensionless probability distribution @xmath28 in what follows . the probability distribution in ( [ 6 ] )",
    "can be considered as the analog of the more familiar white noise distribution for bosonic stochastic variables .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath29 chiral and @xmath30 anti - chiral distributions as well , @xmath31 the expression ( [ 6 ] ) for the probability distribution represents a spurion superfield with non - zero f and d terms : @xmath32_{\\rm f}= \\xi^{*}\\neq 0,~ [ \\tilde { \\cal p } ] _ { \\rm d}=|\\xi|^2\\neq 0~.   \\label{7}\\ ] ] therefore , upon averaging over the stochastic superspace , we expect to obtain a theory with softly broken f - type and d - type terms included .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 then defines the supersymmetry breaking scale .    to see explicitly how this goes consider the simplest theory with a single chiral superfield @xmath33 , whose expansion in component fields is @xmath34 the lagrangian of the model is the usual one modified by averaging over the distribution of the stochastic grassmann coordinates , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the usual super - lagrangian density which consists of two terms : the kinetic term , which is the d - density , @xmath37 and the superpotential term , @xmath38 ( plus the anti - chiral superpotential @xmath39 ) which is the f - density .",
    "the averaging of the kinetic lagrangian ( [ 10 ] ) results in @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the usual supersymmetric kinetic lagrangian . solving for the auxiliary field ( ignoring the superpotential for the moment ) , @xmath42 and plugging ( [ 13 ] ) back into (",
    "[ 12 ] ) we obtain that all terms proportional to @xmath0 cancel with each other , and the remaining lagrangian is invariant under the on - shell n=1 supersymmetry transformations .",
    "let us now compute the potential density : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is invariant under n=1 supersymmetry transformations .",
    "the f - term now reads : @xmath45 substituting ( [ 16 ] ) back into the total lagrangian ( @xmath46 ) , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the familiar on - shell supersymmetric lagrangian of the interacting wess - zumino model .",
    "the remaining terms in ( [ 17 ] ) break supersymmetry softly .",
    "thus we have a majorana fermion @xmath49 with mass @xmath50 and two scalar fields with masses @xmath51 and @xmath52 . to avoid tachyonic states we must assume @xmath53 . the supertrace strm@xmath54 is zero .",
    "the above simple case captures some key aspects of more generic theories with stochastic supersymmetry .",
    "namely , the averaged d - density , @xmath55 of a charged scalar superfield @xmath33 interacting with a gauge superfield ( in the wess - zumino gauge ) , @xmath56 does not produce supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "soft breaking terms emerge from the ( gauge invariant ) superpotential only .",
    "the structure of the soft breaking terms in the context of the minimal standard model with stochastic supersymmetry should now be clear .",
    "they all come from the f - densities .",
    "for example , averaging of the superpotential ( with r - parity conservation being assumed ) , @xmath57 results in the soft breaking terms @xmath58 + { \\rm h.c . } \\label{21}\\ ] ] where fields with tildes denote the scalar components of the corresponding chiral superfields ( in a self - evident notation ) .",
    "soft breaking masses for the gauginos @xmath59 appear upon averaging of the gauge - kinetic f - densities , @xmath60_f-\\frac{\\xi^*}{2}\\sum_i{\\rm tr}\\lambda^{(i)}\\lambda^{(i)}+{\\rm h.c . }",

    "the fundamental - representation generators are normalized as @xmath68 .    summarizing",
    ", we have obtained the following tree - level soft breaking terms :    * the bilinear higgs soft term with @xmath69 . * the trilinear scalar soft terms proportional to the yukawa couplings , with the universal constant @xmath70 . * the universal gaugino masses , @xmath71 . *",
    "the scalar soft masses are absent , @xmath72 .    at the quantum level , the above soft breaking terms are , of course , renormalized , so the relations hold only at some energy scale @xmath9 which joins @xmath0 as a free parameter in the theory .    remarkably , the pattern of the soft breaking terms represents a particular case of the more general pattern of the so - called constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "the cmssm soft breaking terms are usually motivated by spontaneous supersymmetry breaking within _ minimal _ n=1 supergravity .",
    "the model is defined through the following set of extra parameters ( beyond those of the standard model ) : @xmath73 . through",
    "the known standard model parameters and the bilinear soft parameter @xmath1 through @xmath74 , using the extremum conditions for the higgs potential . ]",
    "this model has been extensively studied in the literature and the constraints on the soft breaking parameters have been obtained from various astrophysical and collider experimental data .",
    "obviously , our model is even more constrained than the cmssm .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show that it is phenomenologically viable in an appropriate region of @xmath10 parameter space . to do this , we solve the renormalization group ( rg ) equations and compute the sparticle spectrum at the weak scale as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath75 .",
