    "while several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of multiplicity , fragmentation at early phases is generally regarded as the main mechanism @xcite . in particular , the turbulent fragmentation scenario , which proposes that multiplicity results from turbulent perturbations in a bound core , typically produces wide binaries with separation larger than @xmath11000 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the disk fragmentation scenario , which proposes that fragmentation occurs in gravitationally unstable protostellar disks , produces relatively close binaries with separation typically within a few hundred au ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a number of theoretical works have studied the alignment between the spin ( rotation ) axes of binary / multiple ( hereafter referred to as multiple for simplicity ) components and the binary orbital axis in protostars and stars @xcite . during the early stages of star formation",
    ", misaligned systems can be produced by turbulent fragmentation where the distribution of angular momentum is complex in the initial core , by dynamical capture in a small cluster , or by ejections in a multiple system @xcite . at later stages ,",

    "alternatively , aligned systems can form from a large co - rotating structure in a massive disk / ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by fragmentation of a core whose angular momentum vectors are aligned .",

    "these results show that the majority of the pairs have @xmath48 larger than @xmath47 by a factor of @xmath49 , implying that most systems are bound .",
    "however , this comparison is highly uncertain due to several factors .",
    "first , the separations we used in the formula are the projected separations , which likely under - estimate the actual separations . with actual separations being larger",
    ", the systems would be more unbound .",
    "in addition , the derived @xmath47 only considers components along the line of sight ; components in other directions would increase the differences in the velocities , and the systems would be more unbound .",
    "furthermore , the envelope mass estimates are uncertain by a factor of at least a few due to the choices of dust temperature and dust opacity ( sect .",
    "[ sect : continuum ] ) , and the masses from the central protostars are not included in the envelope masses . by including the masses from protostars",
    "the total masses could increase by a factor of two or more .",
    "the mass estimates also suffer from spatial filtering and do not have contributions from large scales .",
    "we argue that the level of contributions the interferometric observations resolve out are similar in both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and our @xmath48 estimates based on these masses would be lower limits considering this effect .",
    "an increase in the masses would cause the systems to be more bound . with these uncertainties , the estimates of escape velocities",
    "can easily be altered by a factor of a few .",
    "considering these uncertainties , we speculate that the systems with @xmath50 may be soft binaries ( loosely bound ) or intermediate binaries ( between loosely bound and tightly bound ; @xcite ) .",
    "soft binaries are likely to be destroyed by an encounter @xcite .",
    "intermediate binaries may be disrupted or may survive depending on the details of the individual dynamical history @xcite .      . ]    when comparing the differences in outflow orientations , we consider all the possible pairs in each system with separations larger than 1000 au and less than 10000 au @xcite . table  [ tbl : pair ] lists the difference in the outflow orientation for each pair ( @xmath51 ) derived from the data in table  [ tbl : continuum ] . to investigate if the distribution of observed outflow orientation differences , which are projected on the plane of the sky , reflects particular intrinsic distributions in the 3d space , we performed monte carlo simulations considering three distributions in 3d : tightly aligned ( outflows orientation differences less than 20@xmath3 ) , random , and preferentially anti - aligned ( outflow orientation differences between 70@xmath3 and 90@xmath3 ) .",
    "we then project these outflows generated in 3d onto the plane of the sky in 2d .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks ] shows the cumulative distribution functions of the projected outflow orientation differences from the three distributions in 3d . the black solid line shows the observed data of outflow orientation differences from table  [ tbl : pair ] .",
    "we performed kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests with three null hypotheses : the observed distribution is the same as the tightly aligned , random , and preferentially anti - aligned distributions , respectively .",
    "the p - values from the k - s tests are @xmath52 for the tightly aligned distribution , 0.18 for the random distribution , and 0.5 for the anti - aligned distribution . by adopting a significance level of 0.05",
    ", we reject the null hypothesis that the observed distribution is the same as the tightly aligned distribution .",
    "however , we can not reject the other two null hypotheses .",
    "this result suggests that the outflows in these multiple systems are misaligned .",
    "provided that most of our objects are at the youngest class 0 stage , our observations are likely the best available probe of the initial conditions of wide multiple formation .",
    "our k - s test results suggest that members of these wide multiple systems do not come from the same co - rotating structures , or from an initial cloud with aligned vectors of angular momentum .",
    "the results suggest that these wide multiple systems likely formed in environments where the distribution of angular momentum was complex and disordered .",
    "one major possibility for such an environment is turbulent fragmentation , where the distribution of angular momentum has spatial variations @xcite . in this case",
    "misaligned outflows are expected in wide systems @xcite .",
    "another possibility is dynamical interactions such as dissipative star - disc encounters via capture of a passing object , typically with a different direction of angular momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this is less likely since the frequency for such favorable encounters is low .",
    "this work is based primarily on observations obtained with the sma , a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics and funded by the smithsonian institution and the academia sinica .",
    "the authors thank the sma staff for executing these observations as part of the queue schedule , and charlie qi and mark gurwell for their technical assistance with the sma data .",
