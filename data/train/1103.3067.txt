    "the key to this understanding comes from the availability , for large numbers of individual stars , of the powerful combination of six - dimensional phase - space information ( location and velocity ) and chemical abundances .",
    "metal - poor stars , in particular , shed light on the early stages of galaxy formation and chemical evolution , as they represent the fossil record of the first generations of stars that formed shortly after the big bang .",
    "although theory suggests that the bulge of the galaxy may harbor numerous ancient ( though not necessarily the most metal - poor ) stars ( e.g. , tumlinson 2010 ) , the vast majority of presently recognized metal - poor stars are found in the halo system of the galaxy . according to carollo et al .",
    "( 2007 ; c07 ) and carollo et al .

    "2000 ; gunn et al . 2006 ) indicated that the transition from dominance by the inner halo to the outer halo occurs in the range 15 - 20 kpc from the sun .",
    "a similar transition range has been inferred from analysis of the `` vertical '' photometric stripes ( de jong et al .",
    "2010 ) , obtained during the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) sub - survey of sdss - ii ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) .    the papers by c07 and c10 also demonstrated that the inner - halo population is essentially non - rotating , with v@xmath27 = 7 @xmath28 4 km  s@xmath29 , while the outer - halo population exhibits a significant retrograde signature , with v@xmath27 = @xmath3080 @xmath28 13 km  s@xmath29 ( where v@xmath27 is the galactocentric rotational velocity ) .",
    "the velocity ellipsoids of these populations differ as well , such that ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 = ( 150 @xmath28 2 , 95 @xmath28 2 , 85 @xmath28 1 ) km  s@xmath29 for the inner halo and ( 159 @xmath28 4 , 165 @xmath28 9 , 116 @xmath28 3 ) km  s@xmath29 for the outer halo , evaluated in a galactocentric cylindrical reference frame .",
    "the observed differences in the nature of the spatial distributions and kinematics of the stellar populations associated with the inner- and outer - halo components suggests that , in the context of modern hiearchical cosmogonies , their progenitor mini - halos and subsequent merging and accretion scenarios differed as well .",
    "if the inner halo formed from a limited number of moderately massive mini - halos ( see , e.g. , bullock & johnston 2005 ; schlaufman et al . 2009 , 2011 ) , while the outer halo resulted from the accretion of more numerous , but less massive ones ( c07 ; frebel et al .",
    "2010 ; norris et al .",
    "2010a , b , c ) , one might expect to find chemical signatures associated with the presently observed stellar populations that reflect these differences .",
    "previous studies have provided hints that this may indeed be the case . for example",

    "this same study also demonstrated that stars associated with the inner halo exhibit considerably lower star - to - star abundance scatter for both the iron - peak element ratio [ ni / fe ] and the neutron - capture element ratio [ ba / fe ] than found for stars of the outer halo .",
    "the recent study by nissen & schuster ( 2010 ) demonstrated that nearby dwarfs with halo kinematics could be separated into two groups based on [ @xmath34/fe ] .",
    "they proposed that the high-@xmath34  stars may have been born in the disk or bulge of the milky way and heated to halo kinematics by merging satellite galaxies , or else were simply members of the early generations of halo stars born during the collapse of a proto - galactic gas cloud , while the low-@xmath34  stars may have been accreted from dwarf galaxies .",
    "schlaufman et al .",

    "the echos are systematically more fe - rich , but less @xmath34-enhanced than the kinematically smooth component of the inner halo .",

    "our past experience using models of lower metallicity from other sources has indicated that very little changes when dropping below [ fe / h ] @xmath78 .",
    "this is also indicated by the generally excellent agreement of our [ c / fe ] determinations with the high - resolution results discussed below .",

    "the middle panel shows the best matches to the ch g - band obtained from the three different ranges of [ c / fe ] considered .",
    "the lower panel shows the final adopted match .    note that our procedures are not traditional synthesis analyses , but are based on spectral matching . as part of this approach ,",
    "the continuum - flattened observed spectra must be registered to match similarly flattened synthetic spectra . because rectification of the stellar ( and synthetic ) continua is sometimes imperfect , small deviations over localized regions of spectral range can occasionally appear .",
    "careful inspection of the bottom panel of figure 1 reveals , for example , a slight mismatch near the red end .",
    "we have taken care to minimize the occurrence of these mismatches to the extent feasible , with particular effort made in the range that is explored for performing the match to the ch g - band . in any case , since the atmospheric parameters are set before conducting the matching , slight registration offsets outside of the ch g - band region have no effect on our derived [ c / fe ] .",
    "we note that most of the weak features in the region of the ch g - band are real , and not due to noise .",
    "similar procedures have been employed in previously published papers ( beers et al .",

    "estimates of the errors in the final determinations of [ c / fe ] were obtained based on a set of noise - injection experiments for stars over a range of temperatures and s / n ratios .",
    "these experiments indicated that , for stars with a minimum s / n @xmath82 in the region of the g - band , [ c / fe ] could be measured over the @xmath57  range of our sample with a maximum error of 0.5 dex , decreasing to 0.05 dex for the highest s / n spectra ( s / n @xmath83 ) .",

    "spectra not achieving the minimum s / n level ( or which suffered from anomalies such as pixel dropouts ) were considered non - observations ( i.e. , they were dropped from the sample ) .",

    "note that aoki et al . also identified four stars in this temperature range to be cool main - sequence stars , rather than giants , based on the weak lines of their ionized species . for these stars ,",
    "gravity estimates are obtained by matching to isochrones for metal - poor main - sequence stars ( a similar process to that carried out by aoki et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it is expected that the high - resolution analysis estimates of @xmath58  for the cooler stars are precise at a level no better than 0.3 dex .",
    "secondly , difficulty in estimation of @xmath58  for cemp stars might not be suprising , given that molecular carbon bands ( in particular for later type stars ) can easily confound gravity - sensitive features in a low - resolution spectrum . however , in our analysis we have taken care to avoid regions of the spectrum where molecular carbon bands have corrupted the gravity - sensitive features . in reality",
    ", this problem is only encountered for the coolest stars with the strongest molecular bands , which are a distinct minority of our sample .",

    "we then intentionally perturbed their input @xmath58  values by @xmath38 dex , @xmath94 dex , @xmath95 dex , and @xmath96 dex , and derived estimates of their [ c / fe ] following the procedures described above . as can be seen from inspection of figure 3 ( which shows the case for [ c / fe ] = 0.0 )",
    ", the effects on estimates of [ c / fe ] never exceed 0.5 dex ( and then only in the most extreme cases of @xmath28 1.0 dex variation in @xmath58  ) , and are generally much smaller than that .",
    "not surprisingly , the largest variations occur for the warmest stars , which have weaker ch g - band features .",
    "however , our sample included only a small fraction of stars with @xmath57  @xmath13 6500  k ( @xmath97 % ) , so this is not expected to have a major effect .",
    "the mean zero - point offsets and rms variations in the derived [ c / fe ] , relative to the known value across all @xmath57and @xmath58  considered , are shown for each panel in figure 3 , and are acceptably small .",
    "similar results apply to the case when we fix the input [ c / fe ] = + 1.5 .",
    "figure 3 considered the solar [ c / fe ] case , since we are more concerned with false positives that would cause us to count a star as carbon - enhanced when it is not .",
    "we conclude that , while some sensitivity to estimates of [ c / fe ] may exist due to errors in estimates of @xmath58  , its impact on our results should be minimal , except for truly extreme cases .",
    "in this work there are 31187 unique stars for which estimates of [ c / fe ] were carried out ( other objects were either repeats , in which case they were averaged , had insufficient spectral s / n ratios , were clear cases of qsos , cool white dwarfs , or very late - type stars , or had some spectral defect in the region of the ch g - band which prevented measurements being obtained  all such stars are dropped from the subsequent analysis ) .",
    "the remaining sample can be divided into two categories : stars that have a measured [ c / fe ] ( with the g - band detected ; n@xmath98 = 25647 ) , and stars for which only an upper limit on [ c / fe ] has been obtained ( g - band undetected ; n@xmath99 = 5540 ) .",
    "we call the associated two sets of stars subsample d and subsample l , respectively .",
    "figure 4 shows [ c / fe ] as a function of metallicity for these two categories .",
    "the  ridge lines \" in both of the panels are due to grid effects in the chi - square matching procedure .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the stars with measured [ c / fe ] ( subsample d ) exhibit carbonicity below [ c / fe ] = + 0.7 , which indeed appears to be a natural dividing threshold between carbon - normal stars and carbon - rich stars .",
    "this limit was also established by aoki et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , who also included in their analysis expected evolutionary effects on the definition of cemp stars .",
    "we adopt this value of [ c / fe ] to define the carbon - rich stars in our sample , without making any luminosity correction adjustment , since our sample includes very few cool giants .",
    "there is an evident correlation between [ c / fe ] and [ fe / h ] seen in this figure , in particular for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 1.0 .",
    "the relative number of stars with carbon excesses increases as the metallicity decreases , as does the level of carbonicity , as reported previously by several studies based on much smaller samples of stars .    adopting the definition of carbon - rich stars as above , we distinguish two subcategories within subsamples d and l : stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath100 + 0.7 ( c - norm ) , and stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.7 ( c - rich ) . in the case of subsample l ,",
    "the carbon status for a star can be assessed with certainty only when [ c / fe ] @xmath100 + 0.7 , and remains unknown for stars having [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.7 . indeed , suppose that the limit assigned to a given star is [ c / fe]@xmath101 = + 1.5 .",
    "then , all values below [ c / fe]@xmath101 can still be accepted for that star , including carbonicity well below [ c / fe ] = + 0.7 . when the upper limit is below [ c / fe ] = + 0.7 , however",
    ", the carbon status of the star can be assessed as c - norm .",
    "not surprisingly , there is a strong temperature effect in the assessment of the carbon status for stars in our sample .",
    "for example , stars with higher @xmath57  ( above @xmath57  @xmath102  k ) would require quite high [ c / fe ] for the ch g - band to be detected ; stars without a detected ch g - band are included in the l subsample .",
    "thus , the fractions of cemp stars we derive in this paper are lower limits to the true fractions . in a future paper",
    "we plan to obtain an explicit correction function to account for the `` missing '' stars due to this temperature effect , in order to assess its impact on the derived frequencies of cemp stars .",
    "taking into account the above definitions , the fraction of c - rich stars can be formulated as :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are stars belonging to subsample d and having [ c / fe ] @xmath100 + 0.7 and [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.7 , respectively , while n@xmath106 are stars in subsample l and having [ c / fe ] @xmath100 + 0.7 .",
    "stars with unknown carbon status are not included in the above definition .",
    "table 2 reports the number of stars belonging to the various categories for different ranges of metallicity , as well as the total fractions of c - rich stars .",
    "note that , when comparing the reported fractions in this table with other fractions reported in this paper , the table 2 fractions have no restriction on whether or not acceptable proper motion and radial velocity measurements were available for a given star .",
    "we begin with the 31187 unique dr7 calibration stars for which estimates of [ c / fe ] exist , and with distances slightly revised from those presented in c07 and c10 , as described below .",
    "details concerning the nature of the calibration - star sample can be found in c10 ; here we recall a few facts concerning these stars that are of importance for the present analysis .",
    "spectra of the sdss / segue calibration stars were obtained to perform spectrophotometric corrections and to calibrate and remove the night - sky emission and absorption features ( telluric absorption ) from sdss spectra .",
    "the spectrophotometric calibration stars cover the apparent magnitude range 15.5 @xmath107 17.0 , and satisfy the color ranges 0.6 @xmath108 1.2 ; 0.0 @xmath109 0.6 .",
    "the telluric calibration stars cover the same color ranges as the spectrophotometric calibration stars , but at fainter apparent magnitudes , in the range 17.0 @xmath107 18.5 .",
    "the c10 paper describes the radial velocity estimates ( which have a precision of 5 - 20 km  s@xmath29 , depending on the s / n ratio of the spectrum , and with a negligible zero - point offset ) , as well as photometric distance estimates , obtained by using the sspp surface - gravity estimate for luminosity classification , then following the procedures of beers et al .",
    "since the estimated @xmath58  is used only for classification , this means that for stars redder than than main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) , the expected large differences in surface gravity for dwarfs and giants make even approximate @xmath58  estimates sufficient  errors of 1 to 2 dex in @xmath58  would have to be routinely made in order to confound this procedure .",
    "close to the msto , any method of photometric distance estimation becomes more problematic , but the difference in the derived distances for stars just above or just below the msto decreases the closer they are to it , which mitigates against these effects .",
    "schnrich et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have criticized the beers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) method of distance determination , and the results of the c07 and c10 that relied on it .",
    "they claimed that the counter - rotating halo found in c07 and c10 is a result of biases in distance estimates for main - sequence dwarfs , and furthermore that the distance derivation is influenced by sorting a subset of the stars into incorrect positions in the color - magnitude diagram of an old , metal - poor population . in a rebuttal paper , beers et al .",
    "( 2011 ) demonstrated that the the schnrich et al .",
    "claims concerning dwarf distances are incorrect ( due to their adoption of the wrong main - sequence absolute magnitude relationship from ivezi et al .",
    "furthermore , the claimed retrograde tail in the rotation - velocity distribution was shown to arise from the measured asymmetric proper motions , and was not the result of the propagation of distance errors . in any event",
    ", we have applied the procedure suggested in the rebuttal paper to reassign intermediate - gravity stars that were originally classified as main - sequence turnoff stars into dwarf or subgiant / giant luminosity classifications , in cases where their derived @xmath57  were substantially lower than expected for the turnoff . revised distances for these stars",
    "have been adopted as well .",
    "a reassessment of the kinematics indicates that the retrograde signal for the subsample at very low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath152.0 ) remains .",
    "the interested reader can find more details in beers et al .",
    "based on the discussion in that paper , we believe that our distances should be accurate to on the order of 15 - 20% .",
    "the c10 procedures applied a series of cuts to their sample designed to better enable measurement of the kinematic and orbital properties of the various stellar populations considered .",
    "this produced a subsample of stars in the local volume ( distance from the sun @xmath110 kpc , and with 7 kpc @xmath111 10 kpc , where @xmath112 is the galactocentric distance projected onto the plane of the galaxy ) , which they referred to as the  local sample \" ( n @xmath66 17000 ) .",
    "these restrictions were made in order to mitigate against the increase in the errors in the derived transverse velocities , which scale with distance from the sun , and to improve the applicability of the simple models for the adopted form of the galactic potential . for our present analysis we do not need to redetermine the velocity parameters of the underlying stellar populations , so we can relax these cuts somewhat . as described below , in order to increase the numbers of stars in our sample with measured [ c / fe ] , we have changed the constraint on the distance from the sun , from @xmath113 4 kpc to @xmath114 10 kpc , and removed the constraint on the projected distance @xmath112 . with these relaxed cuts",
    "the total number of stars climbs to 30874 .",
    "we refer to this new sample as the  extended sample . \"",
    "the upper panel of figure 5 shows the as - observed metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) for the dr7 calibration stars belonging to the extended sample ( black histogram ) , as well as for stars in the c10 local sample , as described above ( red histogram ) .",
    "we use the term `` as - observed '' in order to call attention to the fact that the selection functions for the calibration stars were not intended to return a fair sample of stars , suitable for an unbiased analysis of the distribution of metallicity for stars in the galaxy .",
    "rather , the calibration stars were selected to emphasize the numbers of moderately low - metallicity stars that might serve to best constrain the spectrophotometry and telluric line corrections carried out as part of the sdss spectroscopic pipeline reductions .",
    "thus , these mdfs are a `` sample of convenience , '' one that is still useful for providing guidance as to the presence of various stellar populations in metallicity space , but not for obtaining estimates of their relative normalizations ( for which other samples drawn from sdss are more suitable ) . no selection for or against carbon - enhanced stars was carried out in the selecton of the calibration - star sample .    the mdfs of the two samples are clearly very similar , and comprise stars with metallicities that sample all of the primary stellar components of the galaxy ( with the exception of the bulge ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure 5 is the distribution of [ c / fe ] ( estimated as described above ) , which we refer to as the carbonicity distribution function ( cardf ) for the extended sample ( black histogram ) , and for the local sample ( red histogram ) .",
    "the inset in the panel shows a rescaling appropriate for the high [ c / fe ] tail of this distribution . as in the case of the mdfs ,",
    "the shape of the two cardfs are similar , with a strong peak at [ c / fe ] @xmath66 + 0.2 to + 0.3 , and two tails , a weak one at low carbonicity ( [ c / fe ] @xmath19 0 ) , and a strong one that extends to high carbonicity , + 0.5 @xmath19 [ c / fe ] @xmath19 + 3.0 . the total number of stars with high carbonicity is significantly different in the two samples",
    "indeed , for the extended sample we find 728 stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.7 , while for the local sample the number is reduced to 318 .",
    "we now examine the mdfs and the cardfs of the extended sample of calibration stars for different intervals in @xmath10z@xmath10 , with cuts chosen to ensure there remain adequate numbers of stars in each interval .    in figure 6 , the first ( left - hand ) column and",
    "the third column show the mdfs , while the second column and the fourth ( right - hand ) column are the cardfs . in the first and third columns ,",
    "the red arrows indicate the peak metallicities of the various stellar populations considered by c10 . in the second and fourth column ,",
    "the blue arrows show the location of the solar carbon - to - iron ratio ( [ c / fe ] = 0.0 ) , and the location of the natural threshold that divides carbon - normal stars from carbon - rich stars ( [ c / fe ] = + 0.7 ) , as identified above .    examination of the first column of panels in figure 6 shows how the mdf changes from the upper - left panel , in which there are obvious contributions from the thick - disk , the metal - weak thick disk ( mwtd ) , and inner - halo components in the cuts close to the galactic plane , to the lower - left panel , with an mdf dominated primarily by inner - halo stars . in the third column of panels , with distances from the plane greater than 5 kpc ,",
    "the transition from inner - halo dominance to a much greater contribution from outer - halo stars is clear .",
    "this demonstration is , by design , independent of any errors that might arise from derivation of the kinematic parameters , and provides confirmation of the difference in the chemical properties of the inner- and outer - halo populations originally suggested by c07 .",
    "the second and fourth columns show the results of the same exercise for the cardfs .",
    "close to the galactic plane ( second column ; up to @xmath10z@xmath10 = 3 kpc ) , where the thick disk and mwtd are the dominant components , the cardf is strongly peaked at values between [ c / fe ] = 0.0 and [ c / fe ] = + 0.3 .",
    "the cardfs of the thick disk and mwtd will be explored in a future paper .",
    "here we simply note that in the regions close to the plane , where these components dominate the sample , there are not many stars populating regions of high carbonicity . at larger distances from the galactic plane , where the inner halo begins to be the dominant component , there appears a tail in the carbonicity distribution towards higher values , [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.5 . in the fourth column of panels , where the distance from the galactic plane is @xmath10z@xmath10 @xmath13 5 kpc , and where we expect to see the beginning of the transition from inner - halo dominance to outer - halo dominance , the tails towards high [ c / fe ] values become even more evident .",
    "the cardf exhibits a strong peak at [ c / fe ] @xmath66 + 0.3 and a long tail towards high values of carbonicity , up to [ c / fe ] = + 3.0 .",
    "the nature of the cardf is likely to be influenced by the change of the mdf as a function of the distance from the galactic plane , due the well - known trend of increasing [ c / fe ] with declining [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , as discussed below , there is evidence that the observed changes may reflect _ real differences _ in the chemistry of the inner- and outer - halo populations , even at a given ( low ) metallicity .    by adopting the threshold of [ c / fe ] @xmath44 ,",
    "the fraction of sdss / segue calibration stars with high carbonicity in the subsample at @xmath10z@xmath10 @xmath13 9 is 20% , ( which , as argued above , is a lower limit ) , in line with previous estimates for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 .",
    "we now consider how the nature of our extended sample differs for the low - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) cemp ( [ c / fe ] @xmath44 ) and non - cemp ( [ c / fe ] @xmath19 + 0.7 ] ) stars .",
    "figure 7 shows two columns of panels , corresponding to the stars in our sample with different cuts on z@xmath115 ( the maximum distance of a stellar orbit above or below the galactic plane ) ; the left - hand column includes stars at all z@xmath116 , while the right - hand column only include stars satisfying z@xmath116 @xmath13 5 kpc .",

    "cemp stars are shown as red dot - dashed histograms ; non - cemp stars are shown as black solid histograms .    as can be seen in the top panel of each column , the peak of the distance distribution in both cases is , for the non - cemp stars , @xmath118 kpc , while for the cemp stars , a softer peak is seen around @xmath119 2.5 - 4 kpc ( closer to @xmath119 4 kpc for the higher z@xmath116 cut ) , with long tails extending to the 10 kpc cutoff of the extended sample . at all distances beyond",
    "kpc the relative fraction of cemp stars exceeds that of the non - cemp stars , while closer than @xmath119 3 kpc the relative fraction of non - cemp stars is greater than that of the cemp stars . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test of the distance distributions indicates that the hypothesis that the cemp and non - cemp stars are drawn from the same parent population is rejected at high significance ( @xmath120 ) for both cuts on z@xmath116 .    for the case of z@xmath121 kpc , stars classified",
    "as dwarfs represent 72% of the non - cemp sample and 42% of the cemp sample , while subgiants and giants represent 24% of the non - cemp sample and 50% of the cemp sample .",
    "for both the non - cemp and cemp samples , main - sequence turnoff stars represent less than 10% of the samples . for the case of z@xmath122 kpc ,",
    "dwarfs comprise 52% of the non - cemp sample and 29% of the cemp sample , while subgiants / giants represent 44% of the non - cemp sample and 63% of the cemp sample .",
    "again , main - sequence turnoff stars comprise less the 10% of both samples .",
    "thus , the difference in distance distribution is not solely dependent on the luminosity classes associated with the populations split on carbonicity ; dwarfs and subgiants / giants are both significantly represented in each of the non - cemp and cemp samples .    from inspection of the bottom panels of figure 7 ,",
    "the non - cemp stars exhibit a slightly asymmetric distribution of rotational velocities centered close to v@xmath123 km s@xmath29 , and a weak retrograde tail .",
    "by contrast , the cemp stars exhibit a rather strong asymmetry extending to large retrograde velocities .",
    "a k - s test of the rotational - velocity distributions indicates that the hypothesis that the cemp and non - cemp stars are drawn from the same parent population is rejected at high significance ( @xmath120 ) for both cuts on z@xmath116 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the distribution of luminosity classes for the split on [ c / fe ] for the retrograde stars with v@xmath124 km s@xmath29 . for the case of z@xmath125 kpc , stars in the retrograde tail classified",
    "as dwarfs represent 66% of the non - cemp sample and 20% of the cemp sample , while subgiants / giants represent 30% of the non - cemp sample and 73% of the cemp sample . for both non - cemp and cemp samples",
    "main - sequence turnoff stars represent less than 10% of the samples . for the case of z@xmath126 kpc , the retrograde stars classified as dwarfs comprise 48% of the non - cemp sample and 18% of the cemp sample , while subgiants / giants represent 47% of the non - cemp sample and 75% of the cemp sample .",
    "again , main - sequence turnoff stars comprise less than 10% of both samples . significant fractions of dwarfs and giants are present in the retrograde tail for both the non - cemp and cemp samples .",
    "thus , the retrograde signature is unlikely to be due to a preponderance of stars with aberrant distance estimates owing to luminosity misclassifications .",
    "if we specialize to the highly retrograde tails , we find that for @xmath127   @xmath128 kpc , the portion of the non - cemp sample in this tail is only 8% for @xmath129  @xmath130 km s@xmath29  and 4% for @xmath129  @xmath131 km s@xmath29  .",
    "for the cemp stars , these portions are 17% for @xmath129  @xmath132 km s@xmath29  and 12% for @xmath129  @xmath131 km s@xmath29  , respectively . for the case of @xmath127",
    "@xmath12 kpc , the portion of the non - cemp sample is 12% for @xmath129  @xmath132 km s@xmath29  and 8% for @xmath129  @xmath131 km s@xmath29  . for the cemp stars , these portions are 24% for @xmath129  @xmath132 km s@xmath29  and 19% for @xmath129  @xmath131 km s@xmath29  , respectively .",
    "thus , in both cases , a split on the level of carbon enhancement leads directly to rather different relative population of the retrograde tails , compared to the full distributions of non - cemp and cemp stars . identifying the highly retrograde tails with the outer - halo population",
    ", we can already infer that the outer - halo component appears to harbor a greater fraction of cemp stars than the inner - halo component .",
    "in addition , before considering a more complete discussion below , we can make use of the @xmath129  distribution to obtain an estimate of the approximate fraction of cemp stars in the outer halo .",
    "we proceed by asserting that the stars in the highly retrograde tail , with @xmath129  @xmath131 km s@xmath29  , are very likely to be members of the outer - halo population .",
    "this follows because the dispersion in @xmath129  for an essentially non - rotating inner halo is on the order of 100 km s@xmath29  , and placing a cut at two sigma below the mean rotation of the inner halo excludes all but 2.5% of likely inner - halo stars . with this assumption",
    ", we find that 11% of the stars in the highly retrograde tail ( and with @xmath127   @xmath13 5 ) kpc ) are cemp stars .",
    "this differs from the calculations immediately above , in that we are considering the fractions of cemp stars relative to the total number of stars ( including those from the l subsample , but not those with unknown carbon status ; i.e. , we are using eqn .",
    "2 ) . recall that this calculation applies only for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 . for this subsample",
    "we find a mean carbonicity of @xmath4[c / fe]@xmath5 = + 1.47 @xmath28 0.07 , where the error is the standard error of the mean .",
    "this value can be taken as a first - pass estimate of the mean outer - halo carbonicity .",
    "figure 8 shows the observed distributions of the measured proper motions in the right ascension and declination directions for the low - metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath133 ) stars in our sample , for two cuts on @xmath127 , represented by small blue dots .",
    "the same panels show , represented as red stars , the objects that populate the highly retrograde tails of the distribution of rotational velocity shown in figure 7 .",
    "note that cuts at @xmath129  @xmath15150 km s@xmath29  and @xmath129  @xmath15200 km s@xmath29  are shown in the upper and lower rows of panels , respectively . as can be appreciated from inspection of this figure ,",
    "the proper motions in both directions for the stars assigned to the highly retrograde tail are asymmetrically distributed , and explore much larger values , relative to the rest of the sample .",
    "this supports the reality of the highly retrograde signature seen in figure 7 , and indicates that it is due primarily to the proper motions of the participating stars .",
    "see beers et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for additional details concerning the veracity and interpretation of sdss proper motions for the sdss calibration - star sample .",
    "in the relatively nearby volume explored by the sdss / segue calibration - star sample , c07 and c10 have shown that the two stellar components of the galactic halo are strongly overlapped in their spatial distribution , velocity ellipsoids , and mdfs .",
    "thus , to explore possible differences in the frequencies and mean carbonicities of cemp stars , it is essential to assign inner- and outer - halo membership probabilities to each star in the sample that is likely to belong to the halo system .",
    "we describe how this is accomplished in the sections below .",
    "in the solar neighborhood , the set of parameters that best identify the presence of the main structures are the distance from the galactic plane , the rotational velocity of a star in a cylindrical frame with respect to the galactic center , and the stellar metallicity ( see c10 ) .",
    "for consideration of the disk system of the galaxy , the distance from the galactic plane is best represented by @xmath10z@xmath10 ( the present distance of a star above or below the galactic plane ) , while for the halo components , a more suitable distance is z@xmath116 , which depends on the adopted gravitational potential .",
    "the choice of z@xmath116 for the galactic halo is necessary because of the much larger spatial extent of its two primary components , relative to that of the disk components .    before seeking a deconvolution of the inner- and outer - halo components ,",
    "we need to check for possible correlations between all of the basic parameters we wish to employ . in c10",
    "we have shown that z@xmath116 has a significant correlation with v@xmath134 and v@xmath135 , but not with v@xmath27 , other than that expected from the presence of the thick - disk population at high positive rotation velocity and the halo at lower rotational velocity .",
    "a very similar behavior is confirmed for the extended sample as well ( figure 9 ) .",
    "we conclude that the galactocentric rotational velocity , v@xmath27 , and the vertical distance , z@xmath116 , when combined with metallicity , can be used to obtain useful information on the different stellar populations present in the extended sample .",
    "the primary chemical parameter of the present analysis is the carbonicity , [ c / fe ] , so it is important to check for its possible correlations with the basic parameters defined above .",
    "the result of this exercise is shown in figure 10 . here",
    ", the upper panel shows the galactocentric rotational velocity as a function of metallicity for the extended sample .",
    "the gray dots represent the stars in the sample with [ c / fe ] @xmath136 , while the red dots denote the stars with enhanced carbonicity , [ c / fe ] @xmath44 .",
    "it is worth noting that the stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.7 are _",
    "almost all _ located in the halo components of the galaxy , with few exceptions .",

    "inference of the distribution function of an observable given only a finite , noisy set of measurements of that distribution is a problem of significant interest in many areas of science , and in astronomy in particular .",
    "the observed distribution of a parameter is just the starting point , but what is desired is knowledge of the distribution that we would have in the case of very small uncertainties of the data and with all of the dimensions of the parameter measured ; in other words , the closest representation of the underlying distribution .",
    "usually , the data never have these two properties , and it is then challenging to find the underlying distribution without taking into account the uncertainty of the data ( bovy , hogg , & roweis , 2011 ; hereafter bhr11 ) .",

    "since a gaussian distribution convolved with another gaussian distribution is again a gaussian , the likelihood for each data point is a sum of gaussian distributions @xmath150 where @xmath151 the objective function is the total likelihood , obtained by simply multiplying the individual likelihoods together for the various data points @xmath152    the optimization of this objective function provides the maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution , or its parameters . in bhr11",

    "in many respects the xd technique described above is similar to the maximum likelihood technique adopted in c10 , but is more general , because it takes into account the uncertainties of the measurements and provides the membership probabilities .",
    "the basic parameters for application of the xd approach for the analysis at hand are the galactocentric rotational velocity , v@xmath27 , the maximum vertical distance , z@xmath116 , and the metallicity , [ fe / h ] .",

    "we conclude that the difference in cemp frequency at very low metallicity is not driven by metallicity itself , but rather , by the stellar populations present .",
    "* the mean carbonicity , @xmath4[c / fe]@xmath5 , remains similar for both the deconvolved inner- and outer - halo components as a function of declining metallicity .",
    "larger samples of low - metallicity cemp stars are required to see if a split in mean carbonicity emerges .      a possible scenario for the formation of the inner- and the outer - halo components has been described in c07 .",
    "the fact that the outer - halo component of the milky way exhibits a net retrograde rotation ( and a different distribution of overall orbital properties ) , clearly indicates that the formation of the outer halo is distinct from that of the inner halo and the disk components . in c07",
    ", it was suggested that the outer - halo component formed , not through a dissipational , angular - momentum conserving contraction , but rather through dissipationless chaotic merging of smaller subsystems within a pre - existing dark matter halo .",
    "these subsystems would be expected to be of much lower mass , and subject to tidal disruption in the outer part of a dark matter halo , before they fall farther into the inner part . as candidate ( surviving ) counterparts for such subsystems , one might consider the low luminosity dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the milky way . in the case of the inner halo , c07 argued that the low - mass sub - galactic fragments , formed at an early stage , rapidly merge into several more massive clumps , which themselves eventually dissipationally merge ( owing of the presence of gas that had yet to form stars ) .",
    "the essentially radial merger of the few resulting massive clumps gives rise to the dominance of high - eccentricity orbits for stars that we assign to membership in the inner halo .",
    "star formation within these massive clumps ( both pre- and post - merger ) would drive the mean metallicity to higher abundances .",
    "this would be followed by a stage of adiabatic compression ( flattening ) of the inner - halo component owing to the growth of a massive disk , along with the continued accretion of the gas onto the galaxy .",
    "this general picture is supported , at least qualitatively , by the most recent numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of large disk galaxies that include prescriptions to handle the presence of gas , and which also include approximate star - formation schemes and follow the evolving chemistry ( e.g. , zolotov et al . 2010 ; font et al .",
    "2011 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2011 ; tissera et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the large fractions of cemp stars in both halo components indicates that significant amounts of carbon were produced in the early stages of chemical evolution in the universe .",
    "the observed contrast of cemp star fractions between the inner halo and outer halo strengthen the picture that the halo components had different origins , and supports a scenario in which the outer - halo component has been assembled by the accretion of small subsystems , as discussed below . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting that the mdf of the inner halo ( peak metallicity at [ fe / h ] @xmath141 1.6 ) is in the metallicity regime associated with the cemp - s stars , which are primarily found with [ fe / h ] @xmath197 , while the mdf of the outer halo ( metallicity peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath66 @xmath302.2 ) might be associated with the metallicity regime of the cemp - no stars , which are primarily found with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 ( aoki et al . 2007b ) .",
    "the fact that , in the metal - poor regime , the outer halo exhibits a fraction of cemp stars that is larger than the inner halo ( cemp@xmath25 @xmath66 2@xmath198cemp@xmath23 ) , suggests that multiple sources of carbon , besides the nucleosynthesis of agb stars in binary systems , were present in the pristine environment of the outer - halo progenitors ( lower mass sub - halos ) .",
    "these sources could be the fast massive rotators and/or the faint supernovae mentioned in the introduction .",
    "karlsson ( 2006 ) also explored the possibility that primordial gas was pre - enriched in heavy metals by less massive sne ( 13 @xmath19 m / m@xmath199 @xmath19 30 ) , whose ejecta underwent substantial mixing and fallback , while the c ( and n , o ) originated from massive rotating stars with m @xmath200 40 m@xmath199 .",
    "if the cemp stars in the outer halo are predominantly cemp - no stars ( which has yet to be established ) , it might suggest that non - agb - related carbon production took place in the primordial mini - halos .",
    "the predominance of cemp - s stars in the inner halo , if found , would suggest that the dominant source of carbon was the nucleosynthesis by agb stars in binary systems .",
    "this would place important constraints on the primordial imf of the sub - systems responsible for the formation of the two halo components .",
    "recent efforts to model , from the population synthesis standpoint , the fractions of observed cemp stars in the halo have not managed to reproduce results as high as 15 - 20% for metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ( e.g. , izzard et al .",
    "2009 ; pols et al .",
    "however , these predictions are based solely on carbon production by agb stars .",
    "while such calculations may prove meaningful for the inner - halo population , they may not be telling the full story for carbon production associated with the progenitors of the outer - halo population .",
    "indeed , the observed increase of the cemp star fraction with @xmath10z@xmath10 ( in particular , far from the galactic plane ) we have found would be difficult to understand if the halo system represents a single population . in any event",
    ", the lower cemp fraction in the inner halo may relieve some of the tension with current model predictions .",
    "the fact that the cemp star fraction exhibits a clear increase with @xmath10z@xmath10 suggests that the relative numbers of cemp stars in a stellar population is not driven by metallicity alone .",
    "the proposed coupling of the cosmic microwave background to the initial mass function ( cmb - imf hypothesis ; larson 1998 , 2005 ; tumlinson 2007 ) is one mechanism for imposing a temporal dependence on the imf .",
    "this effect , coupled with chemical evolution models , predicts that the cemp fraction would be expected to increase as the metallicity decreases , but with similar metallicity regimes forming carbon according to the expected yields of the predominant mass range available at that time . in the hierarchical context of galaxy formation ,",
    "star - forming regions are spatially segregated , and their chemical evolution can proceed at different rates , with stars at the same metallicity forming at different times . depending on the source(s ) of carbon , this trend could lead to a spatial variation of the cemp fraction at the same metallicity , increasing in older populations and decreasing in younger ones .",
    "the larger fraction of cemp stars associated with the outer - halo component could be due to the nature of the progenitor low - mass mini - halos ( mass , density , etc . )",
    "in which they formed . a natural place to look for surviving examples are the ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the milky way discovered in the course of the sdss ( willman et al .",
    "2005 ; belokurov et al . 2006a , b ; zucker et al .",
    "2006 , and many others since ) .",
    "early hints of the possible association of cemp stars with the ultra - faint galaxies came from the recognition that a ( serendipitously ) spectroscopically targeted star from sdss in the direction of the canes venatici ultra - faint dwarf , sdss  j1327 + 3335 , is a carbon - rich giant with a radial velocity and inferred distance commensurate with this very metal - poor satellite galaxy ( zucker et al .",
    "the existence of cemp stars in ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies has now been definitively established ( norris et al .",
    "2010a , b ; lai et al . 2011 ) .",
    "norris et al .",
    "2010b reported the discovery of an extremely carbon - rich red giant , segue 1 - 7 , in the segue 1 system .",
    "this star exhibits a metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath303.5 , carbonicity [ c / fe ] @xmath201 , and a low barium abundance ratio ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath2021.0 ) , which place it in the cemp - no category .",
    "this discovery is consistent with the idea that the cemp - no stars may indeed be associated with the ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies ; further similar investigations should prove of great interest .",
