    "our approach thus contrasts with that of kirat and lau @xcite , who have studied connectedness of sets @xmath3 by generalizing the usual digit sets for base @xmath15 number systems in one dimension to consecutive colinear digit sets , which are not required to be basic digit sets in general .",
    "since the question of connectedness for the sets @xmath3 that we consider is of interest to researchers from diverse backgrounds , including in the wavelet and measureable dynamical systems communities as well as computational and algebraic number theory , we include a brief review of the jordan form .",

    "since @xmath31 is an invertible matrix ( and thus a continuous linear transformation ) , @xmath55 will be a basic digit set for @xmath1 , with digits @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "likewise , the attractors of the corresponding iterated function systems are related : @xmath58 since the mapping defined by @xmath31 is a continuous homeomorphism between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we may conclude the following .",
    "the set @xmath59 is connected if and only if the set @xmath60 is connected .    while any constant multiple of @xmath31 will define a similarity transformation between @xmath1 and @xmath29 , @xmath31",

    "this means , however , that even if @xmath29 has integer entries , the entries in @xmath31 are not necessarily integral , and thus the new digit set @xmath55 will not necessarily be in @xmath14 .",

    "however , @xmath67 also satisfies @xmath68 , and will yield a digit set @xmath55 that is in @xmath69 .    to ensure that @xmath70 , we will consider only matrices @xmath71 and will take the smallest multiple of @xmath62 such that @xmath72 .",
    "the columns of @xmath31 are eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors of @xmath1 , satisfying @xmath73 for some eigenvalue @xmath5 of @xmath1 and multiplicity @xmath74 ( @xmath75 when @xmath76 is not itself an eigenvector ) , so we see that @xmath77 is well - defined .",
    "notice that the measure of the set @xmath59 is @xmath78 times the measure of the set @xmath60 , so the new tiles @xmath59 that we find from the jordan form for @xmath1 will not have measure @xmath40 in general .    we conjecture that the centered canonical digit set @xmath52 for @xmath29 will always yield a connected attractor @xmath60 , and thus allow us to find a digit set @xmath55 for @xmath1 that gives a connected attractor @xmath59 . in this paper , we prove the result in the case that @xmath1 has rational eigenvalues .",

    "a tile @xmath3 need not have an @xmath1-invariant lattice of translations in general ; lagarias and wang give an example of a matrix @xmath1 and digit set @xmath2 such that no lattice of translations @xmath79 for @xmath3 can be @xmath1-invariant ( @xcite , equations ( 1.5 ) ) . inspection of the proof of their theorem 1.1 shows that this can only occur for so - called `` stretched tiles '' , however  @xcite .",
