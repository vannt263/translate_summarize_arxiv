    "networks are often used to describe interactions among the elements of a complex system .",
    "but until recently , the standard assumption in the literature was that networks are isolated entities and do not interact with other networks . today",
    "we understand that this assumption is a rough simplification , since real networks usually have complex patterns of interaction with other networks . in order to study more realistic systems ,",
    "network theory extended its perspective to account for these network to network interactions , and to investigate their influence on various processes of interest that may use the network topology as substrate  @xcite .",
    "networks consisting of multiple networks and the connections between them are called _ interconnected _ or _ multi - layer _",
    "networks  @xcite . in a multi - layered network",
    "each individual layer contains a network that is different from the networks contained in other layers , and the layer interconnectivity refers to the fact that nodes in different layers can be connected to each other .",
    "nevertheless , it is often possible to extend and apply methods developed for single - layer ( isolated ) networks to multi - layer networks , assuming that all layers and the connections between them are known precisely .",
    "unfortunately , when creating networks using relational data on real - world systems we are often confronted with situations where we _ lack information _ about the details of their multi - layer structure . in such situations ,",
    "ensemble - based approaches allow us to reason about the expected properties of such networks , provided that we have access to aggregate statistics which can be used to define a statistical ensemble .    for instance , there are situations in which we are able to precisely map the topology _ within _ each layer individually , but we may not be able to obtain the detailed topology of connections _ across _ different layers .",
    "as an example , we may consider the topology of connections between users in different online social networks ( osns ) .",
    "such a system can be represented as a multi - layer network , where each layer represents the network of connections between users _ within _ one osn .",
    "in addition , cross - layer connections are due to users which are members of multiple osns at the same time , and which can thus drive the dissemination of information across osns .",
    "data on the network topology within particular osns are often readily available , however it is in general very difficult to identify accounts of the same user in different osns .",
    "contrary to the situation described above , we may also consider situations in which detailed information on the topology of cross - layer links is available , while the detailed topology of connections _ within _",
    "layers is not known .",
    "for example , there may be a rather small number of static links _ across _",
    "layers , while the topology of links _ within _",
    "layers is too large and too dynamic to allow for a detailed mapping .",
    "again , in such a situation we may still have access to partial , aggregate information on the _ inter - layer _ connectivity ( such as the number of nodes or the density of links ) which we can use in order to reason about a multi - layer complex system .",
    "both the above situations lead to multi - layer networks , and both require us to reason about a system with incomplete information .",
    "this problem can be addressed from a macroscopic perspective using _ statistical ensembles _ , and in this work we extend the ensemble perspective to multi - layer networks , where we have access to mere aggregate statistics either on links _ within _ or _ across _ layers . combining both detailed and aggregate information on the links in a multi - layer network , we first define a statistical ensemble , i.e. a probability space containing all network realizations that are consistent with available information .",
    "secondly , we assume a probability mass function which assigns a probability to each possible realization in the ensemble . and finally , using either analytical or numerical techniques , we use the resulting probability space to reason about the _ expected properties _ of a network given that it is drawn from the ensemble .    the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows . in sect .  [ methods ]",
    "we present our methodological approach to model ensembles of multi - layer networks , we formally introduce the diffusion process that is assumed to run on the multi - layer network , and we introduce a method that allows to aggregate the statistics of links inside layers and across layers . in sect .",
    "[ meanfield ] we introduce a mean - field approach to approximate ensemble averages , and we investigate under which conditions it can be used to argue about diffusion in multi - layer networks . in particular",
    "we discuss three distinct cases according to different levels of information that we may have about the topology of links across the layers or inside the layers .",
    "in our analysis we investigate a diffusion process that evolves on a static multi - layer network .",
    "more precisely we focus on diffusion dynamics modeled by a random walk process . in the following we provide a short summary that highlights the important properties of this process . note that these are facts already known from the theory of random walks on single layer networks  @xcite , but",
    "later on we will extend this framework to multi - layer networks .",
    "we assume a discrete time random walk process on a network @xmath0 that consist of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "starting at an arbitrary node , at each step of the process the walker moves to an adjacent node , so that for a pair of nodes @xmath2 the probability for a walker to move from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 is given by the corresponding entry @xmath5 of a _ transition matrix _ @xmath6 .",
    "since we have @xmath7 , the transition matrix is row stochastic .",
    "we further consider a vector @xmath8 , whose entries @xmath9 indicate the probability of a random walker to visit node @xmath3 after @xmath10 steps of the process .",
    "here , we consider @xmath11 as a given initial distribution , whose entries @xmath12 give the probability that the random walker has started at node @xmath3 .",
    "the change of visitation probabilities @xmath13 can then be calculated based on the transition matrix as follows : @xmath14 since this is an iterative process starting with @xmath15 , the visitation probability vector after @xmath10 time steps can be calculated as @xmath16 , and we can investigate the long - term behavior of the random walk process for @xmath17 . for a visitation probability vector @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , we can say that the process reaches a stationary distribution @xmath18 , and if the transition matrix @xmath6 is primitive , the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees that such a unique stationary distribution @xmath18 exist .    in order to assess the convergence time of a random walk process , we can study the _ total variation distance _ between visitation probabilities @xmath20 after @xmath10 steps and the stationary distribution @xmath21 . for two distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "the total variation distance is defined according to ref .  @xcite as @xmath24 where @xmath25 indicates the @xmath3-th entry of @xmath22 .    as a proxy for diffusion speed",
    ", we can now investigate how long it takes until the total variation distance @xmath26 falls below some given threshold value @xmath27 ( for a small @xmath27 ) .",
    "in other words , we study how many steps @xmath28 a random walker needs such that @xmath29 for @xmath30    the eigenvalues @xmath31 of a row - stochastic matrix necessarily have absolute values that fall between zero and one , while the largest eigenvalue @xmath32 is necessarily one . the number of required time steps @xmath28 ( and thus the diffusion speed of the random walk process ) can be estimated by means of the the second - largest eigenvalue @xmath33 of @xmath6 , @xmath34 for a detailed derivation see ref .",
    "( [ eq : lambda2 ] ) shows that a second - largest eigenvalue @xmath33 close to one implies slow convergence , while @xmath33 close to zero implies fast convergence . therefore in the following we use the second - largest eigenvalue of a transition matrix @xmath35 as a proxy to measure and quantify the convergence behavior on a network .",
    "the purpose of our study is to investigate diffusion processes on ensembles of networks with multiple interconnected layers .",
    "thus , in the following we briefly introduce the notion of multi - layer networks used in this manuscript .",
    "let us consider a multi - layer network denoted by @xmath0 that consist of @xmath36 non - overlapping layers @xmath37 .",
    "each of these layers @xmath38 is a single - layer network @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the nodes and links of layer @xmath42 respectively .",
    "we call the links @xmath41 between nodes _ within _ the layers @xmath42 _ intra_-links .",
    "the multi - layer network @xmath0 consist in total of @xmath1 nodes , where @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we assume a set @xmath44 of _ inter - layer _ links which connect nodes _ across _ layers , i.e. for each edge @xmath45 we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "inter - layer links induce a multipartite network with the independent sets @xmath37 .    in our study",
    "we consider undirected and unweighted networks , however some of our results may hold even for directed or weighted networks . furthermore , from the perspective of a random walk process , we assume that inter- and intra - layer links are indistinguishable , i.e. transitions are made purely randomly irrespective of the type of link .",
    "as such , the multi - layer network can also be viewed as a huge single network consisting of subgraphs @xmath49 .    as mentioned above diffusion dynamics on networks",
    "can be studied analytically using transition matrices of random walkers  @xcite .",
    "the multi - layer structure of a network can explicitly be incorporated in a random walk model by constructing a so - called _ supra_-transition matrix  @xcite similar to the supra - adjacency matrix used in  @xcite .",
    "the supra - adjacency matrix of a multi - layer network @xmath0 can be defined in a block - matrix structure as @xmath50 on the diagonal we have the adjacency matrices @xmath51 corresponding to the layers @xmath37 , thus entries of these block matrices represent the _ intra - layer links _ of the multi - layer network . off - diagonal matrices @xmath52 for @xmath53 with @xmath48 represent _ inter - layer _ links that connect nodes in layer @xmath54 to nodes in layer @xmath55 . since we consider undirected networks we have @xmath56 .    based on a supra - adjacency matrix @xmath57",
    "we can easily define a _",
    "supra - transition _ matrix @xmath6 of a random walker on a multi - layer network @xmath0 . in block - matrix form",
    "such a matrix can be written as : @xmath58 here , each entry @xmath59 is defined as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the corresponding entries of the supra - adjacency matrix @xmath57 . note that , due the presence of inter - layer links , block matrices @xmath5 are in general not equal to the row - normalized version of block matrices @xmath52 .",
    "the supra transition matrix defined above can be used to model a random walk process on a multi - layer network .    from an analytical perspective",
    "the supra - transition matrix can be treated in the same way as the transition matrix of a single layer as explained above . in the case of undirected networks",
    "the eigenvalues of a transition matrix are related to the eigenvalues of the normalized laplacian matrix . in our case",
    "we study the second - largest eigenvalue of the supra - transition matrix and use it as a proxy for the efficiency of a network with respect to a diffusion process as pointed out above .    using @xmath6 we are able to model a diffusion process on a multi - layer network . since we especially want to emphasize the relevance of the inter - links , in the next section we introduce a transition matrix that only considers transitions across layers and not between individual nodes . as we will see later ,",
    "this aggregated transition matrix is useful to distinguish the influence of inter - layer and intra - layer links on the convergence behavior of a random walk process .",
    "the supra - transition matrix @xmath6 introduced previously contains transition probabilities for any pair of nodes in the multi - layer network . in this sense @xmath6",
    "could also be the transition matrix of a large network , which is not divided in separate layers . in order to understand the effects of a layered structure , in this section we focus explicitly on transitions across layers . to do this we aggregate the statistics of inter - links and the intra - links of all single layers , and",
    "thus , we homogenize all individual nodes that belong to the same layer .",
    "this way we reduce the supra - transition matrix @xmath6 of dimension @xmath1 to an aggregated transition matrix @xmath62 of dimension @xmath36 .",
    "we call this process _ multi - layer aggregation _ and the matrix @xmath62 the _ layer - aggregated _ or just _ aggregated _ transition matrix . later on",
    "we will provide a relation between the eigenvalues of @xmath6 and @xmath62 , which will allow us to decompose the spectrum of @xmath6 .",
    "this is important since the convergence behavior of a random walk process depends on the second largest eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "let us begin by discussing the construction process of the layer - aggregated transition matrix .",
    "our goal is to define transition probabilities across any two layers @xmath63 and @xmath64 by averaging the transitions between any two nodes of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . under certain conditions which will be specified in the following",
    ", these average transition probabilities can be representative for all nodes of the different layers .",
    "let @xmath0 be a multi - layer network that consists of @xmath36 layers @xmath37 .",
    "the transition probability to go from node @xmath65 to any node @xmath66 in @xmath0 is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the weight of a link connecting @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "this is a general formalism , but since we only consider unweighted networks we have @xmath69 if and only if there is a link between the nodes @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    for each node @xmath65 in layer",
    "@xmath63 we require that the transition probabilities @xmath70 to nodes in another layer @xmath64 fulfill the following equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a factor that only depends on the layers @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath73 is used to normalize the transitions , such that @xmath74 is satisfied . in other words",
    "eq.([eqn : cond ] ) implies that the probability for a random walker at node @xmath3 to stay inside layer @xmath63 is a multiple of the probability to switch to layer @xmath64 .",
    "we can see that @xmath72 is independent of @xmath3 , and therefore @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a row stochastic matrix .",
    "this means that @xmath77 resembles a scaled transition matrix , and @xmath72 represents the weighted fraction of all links starting in @xmath63 that end up in @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we can define the aggregation of a supra - adjacency matrix satisfying eq.([eqn : cond ] ) as @xmath78    if a multi - layer network @xmath0 satisfies eq.([eqn : cond ] ) we can follow that the spectrum of the aggregated matrix @xmath79 is @xmath80 and it holds that @xmath81 ( see prop .  [ prop : rev ] in the appendix ) .",
    "this relation implies that the aggregated matrix @xmath62 preserves @xmath36 eigenvalues of the supra - transition matrix @xmath6 , where @xmath36 is the amount of layers .",
    "in other words , under the condition that eq.([eqn : cond ] ) holds , we are able to make statements about the spectrum of the transition matrix @xmath6 only using the layer - aggregated transition matrix @xmath62 .    similar to the fiedler vector ,",
    "i.e. the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix , here we may use the eigenvector @xmath82 corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue @xmath33 of the transition matrix @xmath6 . the vector @xmath82 contains negative and positive entries and sums up to zero . if all individual nodes that belong to the same layer correspond to entries of @xmath82 with the same sign , we consider the layers of @xmath0 partitioned according to @xmath82 , which is also called spectral partitioning or spectral bisection  @xcite . in this case , according to cor .",
    "[ cor : eig ] in the appendix , it holds that @xmath83 .",
    "we note that the multi - layer aggregation , performed according to a spectral partitioning , has similarities to spectral coarse - graining  @xcite .",
    "the multi - layer aggregation presented here decreases the state space as well , but still preserves parts of the spectrum .",
    "the spectral properties introduced in this section are important for our ensemble estimations that follows , since we characterize the diffusion process by its convergence efficiency measured through the second - largest eigenvalue @xmath35 of the supra - transition matrix . however , as outlined before , if eq.([eqn : cond ] ) holds then this eigenvalue is equal to the second - largest eigenvalue @xmath84 of the aggregated transition matrix @xmath62 . considering that for the construction of @xmath62 we only used aggregated statistics on the network and not the detailed topologies of the inter - links or any of the intra - links of all single layers , this already provides a hint how we can treat a system in the case of limited information .",
    "with the layer aggregation introduced in the previous section , we are now able to deal with multi - layer network ensembles in case of limited information . in our case , this information concerns knowledge either of the inter - link topology between layers or the intra - link topologies of all single layers . for our purpose",
    "we define ensembles based on the inter - link densities and intra - link densities of all single layers , more precisely , by using the amount of nodes , the amount of inter - links across any two layers , and the amount of intra - links of all single layers .",
    "the number of nodes in individual layers are represented by the vector @xmath85 and the number of links between layers by a matrix @xmath86 with entries @xmath87 where @xmath88 gives the source layer and @xmath10 the target layer .",
    "intra - layer links have both of their ends in the same layer and therefore we assume that the diagonal elements @xmath89 are equal to the amount of desired intra - links multiplied by two .",
    "we denote the ensemble defined by these two quantities @xmath90 .",
    "a single random realization of this ensemble satisfies the aggregated statistics given by @xmath86 and @xmath91 .",
    "we assume a random uniform distribution of links and therefore each realization of @xmath90 has the same probability .",
    "however , instead of single realizations we are rather interested in the average values of all possible realizations . for each multi - layer network realization",
    "@xmath0 of @xmath90 we build the supra - transition matrix @xmath6 , which defines a random walk process that is different for every realization .",
    "as discussed above , a proxy of the convergence quality of these random walk processes is given by the second - largest eigenvalue @xmath35 .",
    "our goal is to estimate the average @xmath33 of the ensemble @xmath90 , and we do this using a mean - field approach on the supra - transition matrix @xmath6 that is similar to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "hereafter we will provide a mean - field approach for the general case , i.e. when the exact topology of inter - links and intra - links of all single layers are unknown .",
    "next , building on this approach , we will discuss the case for which we have full knowledge of the intra - link topology but we do not know the inter - link topology , and the case for which we have full knowledge of the inter - link topology but we do not know the intra - link topology .      for this case we only assume knowledge of the ensemble parameters @xmath86 and @xmath91 . we define a mean - field adjacency matrix @xmath92 with a block structure similar to eq.([eqn : non ] ) , and for each @xmath93 we are only given the amount of links equal to @xmath87 . since we do not know how these links are assigned to the entries @xmath94 , without loss of generality we assume a uniform distribution .",
    "thus , for the blocks of @xmath92 we have @xmath95    following the discussion of sect .",
    "[ methods ] , based on the mean - field adjacency matrix we define a mean - field transition matrix @xmath96 . the transition probability between any two nodes @xmath97 for a fixed layer",
    "@xmath88 is the same since according to the available information individual nodes can not be distinguished based on their connectivity .",
    "further , the transition probabilities between any two nodes @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the same for any two fixed layers @xmath88 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , all block transition matrices @xmath100 contain the same value at each entry .",
    "hence we have @xmath101 now , using eq.([eqn : cond ] ) we can construct an aggregated supra - transition matrix @xmath62 with entries @xmath102 the aggregated supra - transition matrix @xmath62 describes the macro behavior of the multi - layer network ignoring the detailed topology of the inter - links and the intra - links of all single layers . since @xmath62 depends on a mean - field approach it only captures probabilistic assumptions of the ensemble @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the mean - field supra - transition matrix @xmath96 can be calculated by @xmath103    to clarify the situation , let us briefly discuss the simple case of a network @xmath0 that contains only two layers @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for which we get @xmath106 hence , for the mean - field matrix of a two - layered network we obtain @xmath107 these results are remarkable , since the layer - aggregated transition matrix captures the same relevant eigenvalues as the mean - field transition matrix .",
    "so , for the case of a diffusion process in two layers the eigenvalue of interest is @xmath108 .",
    "however , so far we only considered the general case where we can only use the densities of inter - links and intra - links of all single layers . in the following two sections",
    "we will investigate cases where we may have some additional information about either the inter - link topology between all single layers or the intra - link topology of all single layers .",
    "for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to the two layer case but , as shown in the appendix , our results can be generalized to multiple layers .      for this case",
    "we assume full knowledge of the intra - link topology , i.e. we know exactly which nodes are connected in all of the single layers .",
    "but while we know the number of links between the layers we do not know how the layers are connected , i.e. we do not know the inter - link topology . with respect to the general case discussed previously , here",
    "we have more information which is expected to improve the estimates of the ensemble average .",
    "more precisely , we consider a two - layer network with unknown inter - link structure denoted by @xmath44 , but with a given amount of @xmath109 interconnecting links which connect the networks @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the diagonal blocks @xmath110 and @xmath111 of the supra - adjacency matrix are given , but the off - diagonal blocks @xmath112 and @xmath113 can take any form such that they have exactly @xmath109 entries different from zero . since there are no further constraints on the ensemble , any random link configuration that consists of @xmath109 inter - links has the same probability to occur .",
    "therefore , we define the mean - field supra - adjacency blocks that correspond to the inter - links , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , to have the same value @xmath116 in each entry .    for the supra - transition matrix",
    "we have to row - normalize @xmath110 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath117 .",
    "the row sums of @xmath114 are all equal to @xmath118 and the row sums of @xmath115 are all equal to @xmath119 , while the row sums of @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to the individual degrees of the nodes in @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "thus , we use the mean degree @xmath120 of @xmath104 and @xmath121 of @xmath105 in order to obtain the row - normalized transition matrix @xmath96 , and to define the following factors @xmath122 note that @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    accordingly we define the mean transition blocks of @xmath125 and @xmath126 . @xmath127",
    "this means that each of the off - diagonal block matrices that correspond to the mean - field inter - link structures have the same value at each matrix element , and the diagonal blocks are just rescaled transition matrices of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the row - normalized version of matrix @xmath86 .",
    "we denote the supra - transition matrix with the blocks constructed as described before by @xmath96 , @xmath130    this mean - field matrix has some special properties .",
    "first of all , the eigenvalues of @xmath131 and @xmath132 are also eigenvalues of @xmath96 .",
    "further , the multi - layer aggregation of @xmath96 is given by @xmath133 so , the second - largest eigenvalue of @xmath62 is given by @xmath134 .",
    "the second - largest eigenvalues of @xmath135 is equal to @xmath136 and of @xmath137 is equal to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "therefore the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath96 , denoted by @xmath141 , fulfills the following condition ( see prop .",
    "[ prop : spec ] in the appendix for more details ) @xmath142    we would like to remind the reader that an eigenvalue @xmath33 close to one implies slow convergence and @xmath33 close to zero fast convergence . from the above equation we can see that as long as @xmath134 is maximal the inter - links are the limiting factor of the convergence in the multi - layer network .",
    "this means that due to the inter - link topology the random walk diffusion is slowed down , and the influence of the intra - layer topologies is marginal to the process .    when either the term of @xmath143 or @xmath144 is maximal then the diffusion is limited by the single layer @xmath104 or @xmath105 , and the additional information provided by the intra - layer topologies becomes relevant as it affects the diffusion process .",
    "note that the change between @xmath33 and either @xmath145 or @xmath146 being maximal is related to the transitions pointed out in ref .",

    "the figure shows the second largest eigenvalues of @xmath147 and the sparsest layer @xmath148 for different amount of inter - links .",
    "when only a few inter - links are present the interconnectivity between layers slows the process down , as it is expected .",
    "when we increase the amount of inter - links , we can reach the convergence rate of single layers , which is the point where the single layers slow down the process .",
    "however , with an increasing amount of inter - links the single layers lose their importance and the process is again slowed down by the inter - links .",
    "this happens because a very large amount of inter - links force the random walker to switch between layers with increasing probability , thus , preventing diffusion to reach the whole layer .",
    "to conclude , the mean - field transition matrix @xmath96 is a better estimation than @xmath62 in intermediate numbers of interlinks , which for our systems is in the region of approximately @xmath149 to @xmath150 inter - links .",

    "this implies that we do not always need perfect information to make statements about a multi - layer network because , under certain conditions , we are still able to make analytical statements about the network only using partial information . in realistic situations data can be an issue either due to availability constraints or due to their vast amounts . in such cases , even though an exact analysis is impossible , we may still derive useful conclusions about processes that depend on the network spectrum ( like diffusion and synchronization ) using only aggregated statistics .",
