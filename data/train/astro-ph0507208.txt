    "recent numerical ( bromm , coppi & larson 1999 , 2002 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 , 2002 ) and semi - analytical ( omukai & nishi 1998 ; omukai 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 , 2002 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; omukai & palla 2003 ) studies consistently predict that the first , so - called population iii ( popiii ) , stars had characteristic masses of 100 - 600 @xmath0 , i.e. roughly ten times more massive than those observed today . since mass loss at zero metallicity can be neglected ( kudritzki 2002 ) , the final fate of popiii stars is essentially set by their initial mass . in the narrow range of progenitor masses , @xmath1 ,",
    "popiii stars explode as pair instability supernovae ( sn@xmath2 ) leaving no remnant and polluting the universe with metals ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "non - rotating stars with masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 will instead collapse directly into black holes ( bh ) , without metal ejection",
    ". these intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) may provide the seed for the supermassive bhs observed in the center of luminous galaxies ( e.g. , volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) . if imbhs accrete material from the surrounding medium , they will shine as `` miniquasars '' and may contribute to the reionization of the universe at high redshift ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; venkatesan , giroux & shull 2001 ; oh 2001 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004a , b ; madau et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the contribution of this population of early miniquasars to various cosmic backgrounds .",
    "we show that available observations can be used to set strong constraints on the radiative proprieties of these sources .",
    "in particular the soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) is easily overproduced unless miniquasars are very rare , or , in case more common , if their shining phase is very short . as a byproduct ,",
    "we show that , in both cases , their expected contribution to the near infrared background is negligible .",
    "the mean specific background intensity @xmath5 at redshift @xmath6 observed at frequency @xmath7 , produced by a population of sources characterized by a comoving emissivity @xmath8 , can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the proper line element . in the above expression we have neglected , for reasons that will become clear later on , any absorption of photons as they propagate in the expanding universe .",
    "the source term @xmath12 can be written , in general , at any given cosmic time @xmath13 , as a convolution of the light curve of the sources @xmath14 with the source formation rate ( per unit comoving volume ) @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 yr is the salpeter time , @xmath18 is the accretion radiative efficiency , and @xmath19 is the eddington luminosity . the second approximated equality holds averaging the light curve over a typical source lifetime @xmath20 , leading to a specific luminosity @xmath21 . and assuming a constant source formation rate over such timescale .",
    "the emissivity is then proportional to the accreted mass @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the initial bh mass .",
    "although the _ frequency integrated _ background depends only on the amount of accreted mass , and not on the details of the accretion process , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in a given narrow band may depend on the properties of the accreting bhs .",
    "for example , for fixed @xmath24 , a shorter @xmath20 would imply a smaller final bh mass ( and a larger number of those bhs ) , with a resulting hotter disk component ( see next section 3 ) .",
    "note that , since @xmath21 can be written as a fraction @xmath25 of the eddington luminosity ( see next section ) , @xmath26 is independent of this parameter .",
    "we compute the source formation rate using the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) adopting the minimum dark matter halo mass , @xmath27 , computed by fuller & couchman ( 2000 ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt the ` concordance ' model values for the cosmological parameters : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dimensionless hubble constant , @xmath35 km s@xmath36 mpc@xmath36",
    "the physical characterization of the sources is encoded in the sed @xmath37 , and in the typical lifetime @xmath38 .",
    "the uv / x  ray sed of an accreting bh , is , observationally , approximatively described in terms of two main continuum components ( see , e.g. , tanaka & levin 1995 ) .",
    "the low energy component is thought to originate from the putative accretion disk , and , at least in stellar - sized bhs ( the so - called galactic black hole candidates gbhcs ) , it is spectroscopically well described by a  multicolor disk black body \" ( mitsuda et al .",
    "the accreting gas is assumed to be optically thick , and the gravitational power locally released as black body radiation .",
    "different radii radiate at different temperatures , with the hottest planckian emitted at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "assuming eddington limited accretion , this model yields to @xmath41 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the characteristic multicolor disk spectrum is broadly peaked at @xmath42 , follows a power law with @xmath43 for energies @xmath44 , and exponentially rolls off for @xmath45 .",
    "the second observed component is a simple power - law @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the precise origin of this power - law emission is controversial ( several different models exist to date ) , and is likely to originate from synchrotron and/or inverse compton ( ic ) emission by a mixture of thermal and nonthermal electrons , located in an active corona and/or in a relativistic jet ( for e recent review see , e.g. , zdziarski & gierlinski 2004 ) .",
    "both the low and the high energy ends of the power law are not firmly known . hard ",
    "states of gbhcs and seyfert i galaxies show exponential cut - offs at @xmath48 kev ( matt 2001 ) , while in the steeper soft state of gbhcs , and in more distant objects such as qsos , observations fail due to the low s / n .",
    "the low energy end of the power law , as well , could start at @xmath49 , if the soft photon input for the ic cooling of the relativistic electrons is due to disk radiation , or , instead , could extend into the ir if local synchrotron radiation is , in the corona / jet , energetically important ( ssc models ) .    the two component spectrum , though historically motivated by studies of gbhcs and seyfert galaxies , approximates quite well the high energy emission observed in ultraluminous x - ray sources , a recently discovered population of x - ray sources possibly associated to accreting imbhs , @xmath50 ( miller et al . 2003 ) .",
    "observationally , an imbh seems to have comparable mcd and pl luminosities , although the ratio between the two components might vary among sources , and the extension of the pl is not known . in order to model in a simple , but physically motivated , way the sed of an accreting imbh , we assume that the pl component is due to ic scattering of thermal disk photons , and hence we consider energies @xmath51 .",
    "this is a clear difference with respect to the sed used by dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and by madau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who assumed the pl component to be present for @xmath52 ev , so that it is dominant with respect to the mcd in terms of emitted ionizing photons .",
    "we account for the population spread of the pl / mcd flux ratio by introducing an empirical parameter : @xmath53 it may worth noticing that , for a fixed bh mass , the value of @xmath54 determines the luminosity of the x  ray part of the emitted spectrum .",
    "we also parameterize the bolometric luminosity ( i.e. , mcd+pl ) of an imbh of mass @xmath23 as a fraction @xmath55 of the eddington luminosity , @xmath56 erg s@xmath36 .",
    "moretti et al . ( 2003 ) determined the intensity of the total sxrb in the energy range 0.5 - 2 kev to be @xmath57 erg @xmath58 s@xmath36 deg@xmath59 when combining 10 different measurements reported in the literature . including further deep pencil beam surveys together with wide field shallow surveys , they find that @xmath60% of the sxrb is made up of discrete x - ray sources ( the majority being point sources ) at low redshift , @xmath61 ( barger et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) . by reanalyzing the moretti et al .",
    "uncertainty budget , dijkstra , haiman & loeb ( 2004 ) provided a mean and a maximum intensities of the unaccounted sxrb flux , @xmath62 and @xmath63 erg @xmath58 s@xmath36 deg@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "a population of imbhs forming at high redshift can contribute to the sxrb .",
    "we compute here the expected background intensity in the energy band 0.5 - 2 kev according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i])-([eq : eps ] ) for a population of miniquasars whose formation continues down to a given redshift , @xmath64 , as a final evolutionary product of massive popiii stars .",
    "given the hard energy band and low igm metallicities we are concerned with , we neglect any absorption term in the radiative transfer equation ( eq .  [ eq : i ] ) .    in the 0.52 kev energy range ,",
    "the background intensity is dominated by the power - law component of the miniquasar spectrum , unless @xmath65 .",
    "we consider here the two extreme values of @xmath66 . in order to set upper limits on the propriety of this first population of accreting imbhs",
    ", we give the result for the maximum unaccounted sxrb flux derived by dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    unless miniquasars are extremely x - ray quiet ( and therefore @xmath67 ) , we find that the sxrb sets strong constraints on the density of miniquasars , which are summarized in the top panel fig . 1 as a function of their lifetime .",
    "the curves refer to different turn - off redshifts @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "apart from the differences in the value of @xmath64 , which introduces an uncertainty of a factor @xmath69 on the estimates , we see that for @xmath70 , the mass fraction of imbh can not exceed @xmath71 ( that is of the same order of the density of the smbh today , merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) , even for an extremely short lifetime @xmath72  yr .",
    "this constraint increases to @xmath73 in the case in which imbhs are extremely inefficient x - ray emitters ( @xmath74 ) , i.e. a large fraction of the baryon density might be locked into bhs without exceeding the sxrb constraint ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "since we have assumed the maximal sxrb residual intensity , the above values must be understood as strong upper limits .",
    "in addition , other sources , such as high redshift quasars ( dijkstra et al . 2004 ) , may contribute to the unresolved sxrb , leading to even more stringent limits .",
    "we conclude that early miniquasars were quite rare and/or their shining phase lasted only for a very short period of time .",
    "we can rewrite these limits in terms of the maximal mass growth of bhs allowed by the unaccounted sxrb . in fig .",
    "[ fig : grow ] we show the final imbh density and the growth factor , defined as the ratio between final and initial imbh density , for sources forming at @xmath75 ( different lines refer to different values of accretion radiative efficiency @xmath18 ) as function of the initial mass density of imbh , @xmath76 . for sources forming down to @xmath77 @xmath78 the limits",
    "are tighter of a factor 1.8 ( 2.6 ) .",
    "we find that for @xmath79 a strong upper limit to the final mass density @xmath80 for a wide range of initial densities , i.e. for @xmath81 .",
    "considering that low redshift ( @xmath82 ) accreting bhs are taken into account in the resolved fraction of the sxrb , we can derive an upper limit on the density of bhs ( active and not ) at @xmath83 of @xmath84 mpc@xmath85 , which is @xmath86% of present day smbh mass density ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "this value is not at odd with current models of smbh assembly in a hierarchical structure formation scenario ( volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; madau et al .",
    "as example , volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that the mass density locked into bhs is of the order of @xmath87 mpc@xmath85 at @xmath88 .",
    "this mass growth corresponds to a sxrb contribution of @xmath89 erg @xmath58 s@xmath36 deg@xmath59 , that is a not negligible fraction of the maximal unresolved intensity , and it is comparable to the mean value of this quantity .",
    "moreover , we find also a contribution in the hard - x band ( 210 kev , so  called hxrb ) of the order of @xmath90 erg @xmath58 s@xmath36 deg@xmath59 , corresponding to @xmath91% of the observed hxrb .",
    "thus , within hierarchical clustering models , a significant fraction of the unaccounted sxrb ( and hxrb ) should come from the growth of imbhs in the early universe .",
    "for example , using the madau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model we find that the sxrb ( hxrb ) is @xmath92 erg @xmath58 s@xmath36 deg@xmath59 already at @xmath93 for 3.5@xmath94 peak seeds , assuming an accreted mass corresponding to @xmath95 of the halo mass .",
    "stronger constraints on the maximal growth of imbhs in the early universe can be set by the next generation of x - ray satellites ( e.g. constellation - x , xeus ) that will be able to resolve sources 10 times fainter than the present facilities . extrapolating the @xmath96 to this flux limit will allow to resolve the sxrb entirely ( moretti et al .",
    "2003 ) . if this were the case , strong limits on the grow history of bhs in the early universe can be derived , or conversely , on the spectral energy distribution at high energies of these sources .",
    "the limits on the radiative proprieties of miniquasars derived from the sxrb constraint allow us to give a simple estimate of the role of these sources in the reionization of the universe .",
    "the number of ionizing photon per hydrogen atom can be written as    @xmath97    where @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the fraction of the bolometric power emitted as hydrogen - ionizing photons with mean energy @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath102 is the mass fraction in hydrogen . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nion ] are shown the limits on this quantity derived from the maximum unaccounted sxrb assuming @xmath79 .",
    "different lines refer to different lifetime of the miniquasar phase , @xmath20 .",
    "the labels report the number of e - folding times , @xmath103 .",
    "sources forming at very high redshift and accreting for 10 e - folding time will be able to produce just 3 photons per hydrogen atoms , but shorter lifetimes give lower @xmath104 , indicating that miniquasars can not easly reionize the universe if recombination is taken into account . at lower redshift",
    "the situation is even worst .",
    "miniquasars forming down to redshift 9 can not produce more than one ionizing photon per hydrogen atom without saturating the sxrb .",
    "moreover , these values are to be taken as strong upper limits , since we considered the maximum residual sxrb intensity . using the mean unaccounted sxrb intensity will lead to a reduction of a factor @xmath105 of @xmath104 .    in conclusion ,",
    "miniquasars unlikely account for the reionization of the universe even at high redshift , unless they are extremely x - ray quiet . in order to have @xmath106 without exceeding the maximum unresolved sxrb",
    "we must required @xmath107 ( 0.07 ) , for sources forming down to redshift @xmath75 ( @xmath108 ) and living @xmath109 .",
    "recent measures of the near infrared background ( nirb ; see hauser & dwek 2001 for a review ) show an excess with respect of the observed light from galaxies in deep field surveys ( madau & pozzetti 2000 ; totani et al .",
    "the discrepancy is maximal in the j band corresponding to @xmath110 erg s@xmath36 @xmath58 sr@xmath36 .",
    "the large uncertainty on this value is given by the different adopted subtraction of zodiacal light ( i.e. sunlight scattered by the interplanetary dust ) contribution .",
    "estimates based on theoretical models suggest that this excess can be well produced by redshifted light from the first very massive ( @xmath111 ) popiii stars ( santos , bromm & kamionkowski 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) if these form efficiently down to @xmath112 .",
    "the same stars can also account for the observed small scale angular fluctuations detected in the same bands ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to avoid over - enrichment of the igm with metals at high redshift",
    ", most of these massive stars must end up into imbhs .",
    "cooray & yoshida ( 2004 ) have speculated that if these imbhs accrete matter and shine as miniquasars , they might give an important contribution to the nirb .",
    "we have revisited this conclusion in the light of the results of the section [ sec : sxrb ] . using the limits implied by the sxrb , we find that the contribution to the nirb of these sources is completely negligible .",
    "in fact , for @xmath112 , the nirb contribution from miniquasars in the j band allowed by the sxrb constrain is @xmath113 erg s@xmath36 @xmath58 sr@xmath36 , hence well below the observed value .",
    "an appreciable contribution in the nir bands is possible only in the unlikely case in which miniquasars are extremely x - ray quiet . in this case ,",
    "@xmath65 and the limits set by the sxrb are very weak . for sources forming down to @xmath112",
    "the nirb excess data can be fitted without saturating the unaccounted sxrb . by redshift 9 and considering @xmath114",
    ", bhs can increase their mass density for almost 6 e - folding times , or about a factor 400 . in this case ,",
    "an initial bh mass density of @xmath115 is sufficient to reproduce the nirb data .",
    "on the other hand these bh have to accrete all the time down to @xmath108 resulting in a final mass density of @xmath116 .",
    "we have studied the contribution of the first generation of miniquasar to cosmic backgrounds . in particular , we have shown that the observed residual sxrb intensity ( moretti et al .",
    "2003 , dijkstra et al .",
    "2004 ) can be used to set strong constraints on the abundance and radiative efficiency of these sources . unless these objects are extremely x - ray quiet , the sxrb is easily overproduced , requiring miniquasars to be quite rare and/or have a short shining phase . should accreting imbhs",
    "saturate the sxrb , they would contribute also 6 - 7% of the hxrb .    as a consequence of our analysis ,",
    "it is unlikely that miniquasar can reionize the universe , since their are limited to produce @xmath117 photons per hydrogen atom , even at high redshift .",
    "this conclusion is similar to dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , though our limits are tighter owing to a more physically motivated description of the miniquasar spectrum .",
    "moreover our approach allow us to follow the evolution of the mass density of accreting imbhs with time , so that we can derive important constraints on the mass growth of these objects in the early universe .",
    "we derived a strong upper limit to ( active and not ) imbhs mass density at @xmath83 , being @xmath118 mpc@xmath85 .",
    "although this value is not at odd with current model of smbh assembly in the hierarchical scenario of structure formation , stronger constraints on the sxrb unaccounted fraction by future x - ray facilities ( i.e. constellation - x , xeus ) could question our ideas of the formation of quasars .",
    "in fact , given the prediction of these models we expect that a not negligible fraction of the sxrb will not be resolved , being the signature of the growth of imbhs in the early universe .    as a further byproduct",
    ", we have shown that their contribution in the near infrared bands is completely negligible . in the proposed models of the nirb ( santos et al .",
    "2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 , magliocchetti et al .",
    "2003 ) the nirb excess is due to redshifted light of popiii stars with masses larger than 100 @xmath0 . in order to avoid over - enrichment of the igm at high redshift , most of these stars must end up in imbhs , locking @xmath119% of the baryons into compact objects already at @xmath108 .",
    "though not excluded by any of the current experiments ( including gravitational lensing data , wambsganns 2002 ) , this requirement is somewhat extreme , as pointed out by madau & silk ( 2005 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that miniquasars powered by accretion onto imbh can not contribute appreciably to the nirb , as they easily exceed the sxrb constraints .",
    "in fact , the imbhs left over by the first stars must be characterized by a very short shining phase ( @xmath120 yr , assuming @xmath121 ) and/or very low accretion efficiency in order not to overproduce the sxrb . as a consequence ,",
    "imbhs can not grow appreciably in mass . only in the unrealistic case @xmath67",
    ", the contribution to the unaccounted nirb from miniquasars might dominate that of the progenitors . in this case",
