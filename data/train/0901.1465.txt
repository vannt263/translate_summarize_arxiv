    "it is written in a few months but authors try to show their way of understanding the nature or rather of understanding some aspects of the biological evolution .",
    ", , their way  means both - how they understand and what was the chronology of understanding the facts . in the first part , the simplest rules of coding the genetic information are described .",
    "everybody knows what is the genetic code , everybody knows what is the structure of the dna double helix , maybe even how it is translated for amino acid sequences in proteins , but it is not a common knowledge how nature exploits the fact that the two strands of dna differ in the mechanism of their synthesis , composition , mutation pressure and selection .",
    "it is the only part where genes are represented by long series of different elements which have to be translated into chains of other compounds and their biological functions are checked at the end of the process of the virtual evolution . in the next parts",
    "these genes with very complicated structures are replaced by single bits .",
    "reader can intuitively feel that it is a swindle .",
    "nevertheless , remember that it is not a physicist who tries to convince you that such simplification is possible - it is a biologist .",
    "physicists are very skilful in such simplifications , they were even able to count the planets paths assuming that they are just points - everybody knows that earth is not a point ! using our simplification that gene is represented by one bit we were able to answer such questions like why men are altruistic and women are egoistic , why women live longer than men , why y chromosome is short , why nature invented death and if there is any significant difference between the fruit flies and humans .",
    "all answers have been obtained assuming that at least a part of genomic information is switched on chronologically . in the third part",
    "we have even resigned from this chronology , instead , we have introduced some specific behaviour of our virtual creatures , particularly their sexual behaviour . using a very simplified mechanism mimicking meiosis ( unfortunately necessary in sexual reproduction as well as in the modelling such reproduction )",
    "we were able to show that speciation is a very simple phenomenon even in sympatry .",
    "the last results would be interesting even for darwin himself when writing his , , the origin of species by means of natural selection  .",
    "since it is a biological paper , rather , and the mathematical formal language is too difficult for biologists , you should not expect formulas in the text .",
    "but the text is dedicated for mathematicians and they simply can translate the results obtained by the monte carlo methods for their beautiful phenomenological language .",
    "i hope that everybody , after reading the text will have much more questions and problems which could be quantitatively described , and readers should judge if god should be informed about such quantitative versions of the biological facts .        before watson and",
    "crick discovered the dna ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) structure , griffith had found that there was some information in the bacterial cell which could be transferred from the dead cell to the living cell , changing the ( genetic ) property of the last one @xcite . in 1944",
    "avery s group found that it was probably the dna molecule responsible for transmitting the information between these cells @xcite .",
    "avery only warily suggested that it could be the dna but in fact he proved that .",
    "scientific world was not ready to accept the hypothesis that such a dull molecule , composed of only four different subunits can be a carrier of genetic information .",
    "proteins seemed to be much better and obvious candidates for such an important role .",
    "there were other very fundamental discoveries which enabled the discovery of the double helix - the chargaff s rules .",
    "chargaff found that the number of adenine ( a ) equals the number of thymine ( t ) while the number of guanine ( g ) equals the number of cytosine ( c ) in any dna preparation .",
    "moreover , chargaff found that the ratio @xmath0/[g+c]$ ] is constant for a species independently of the tissue where the dna was isolated from , though the ratio could be different for different species @xcite .",
    "the letters a , t , g and c will be used in the text for connotation the four nucleotides building the dna .",
    "now , more than 50 years after the dna double helix discovery , it is very easy to say what the rationale should be at the bases for creating the model - in fact , only four of them ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :     schematic structure of dna molecule .",
    "bases : a , t , g and c stand for adenine , thymine , guanine and cytosine respectively , they form the rungs of the , , ladder  while phosphate groups and sugar molecules ( deoxyribose ) built the rails .",
    "notice two antiparallel strands forming the double helix .",
    "the diameter of helix is about 2 nm and length could be measured even in centimetres or several millions of base pairs . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]      april 25th , 1953 watson and crick published in , , nature  a paper entitled , , a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid  .",
    "it begins with the sentence , , we wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid ( dna ) .",
    "this structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest ",
    "they proposed that the dna molecule is a double helix that resembles a gently twisted ladder ( ten rungs per one twist ) .",
    "the rails of the ladder are made of alternating units of phosphate and the pentose ( deoxyribose ) ; the rungs are composed of pairs of nitrogen bases : at and gc .",
    "here we find this chargaff s rules , called now the deterministic complementarity rules or parity rules i ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the dna model is very elegant but there is one very peculiar feature of the dna molecule - resulting from the third assumption - the rails are antiparallel . to be antiparallel means that the rails have their directions .",
    "deoxyribose is an asymmetric molecule with five atoms of carbon ( numbered 1 - 5 ) .",
    "phosphate links the atom number 3 of one deoxyribose with the atom 5 of the other one .",
    "it is obvious that at one end there is a free carbon number 5 while at the other end there is a free carbon number 3. for chemists it is enough to say that the whole dna strand has a direction 5 to 3. at the end of the double helix dna molecule one strand has 3 end and the other one has 5 end .",
    "do you think it is not so important ?",
    "imagine , you are in the middle of the molecule and you try to reach the end of it - where is the end ? even if you know that the end is marked by the free 3 carbon - but , of which strand ?",
    "thus , it is very important to determine the direction in the double strand or , if we accept the direction of single strand @xmath1 then we have to indicate the strand we are thinking about .",
    "please keep in mind this feature because a lot of phenomena discussed in this chapter will show the consequences of this very nuance in the dna structure for its coding capacity , control of information expression and evolution .",
    "we will see in the next sections how the information imprisoned in the dna molecule can be expressed and used by the , , body  of the host organism .",
    "now , the only issue which should be important for us is to imagine the dna molecule inside the compartments where we can find it .",
    "if we are talking about the living organisms and we assume that viruses do nt live ( i am not sure if i know why ) , then the bacteria are the smallest living creatures which use dna as their genetic data base .",
    "the whole information of one bacterial cell is called its genome .",
    "usually it is built of one dna molecule though , some species of bacteria posses the genome composed of more than one molecule .",
    "if the molecule is indispensable for life of the bacteria cell it is called chromosome , otherwise it is called plasmid",
    ". we will talk about chromosomes , only .",
    "the free living bacteria usually have larger genomes - up to 10 millions of nucleotides ( ! ) .",
    "some bacteria have found a very comfortable niche for living - the interior of other cells .",
    "those bacteria usually reduce their genome just because they do nt need the whole information indispensable for fighting for everything ; they have almost everything ready in the host cell . for",
    "such bacteria 0.5 million of nucleotides in their data base could be enough .",
    "escherichia coli , bacterium living in our alimentary tract is in the middle of this range and has dna molecule built of about 5 millions of nucleotides .",
    "the diameter of the dna molecule is about 2 nm and the length ... about million times larger - of the order of millimeters .",
    "it is about thousand times more than the diameter of the cell .",
    "this range of proportion is very common for bacterial as well as eukaryotic cells , dna molecule is three orders longer than the diameter of the compartment in which it exist .      here",
    "we present some information on the bacterial genomes .",
    "escherichia coli chromosome is circular , like most of bacterial chromosomes .",
    "all information necessary for life is enclosed in the chromosome .",
    "nevertheless , bacteria can posses a lot of additional information indispensable for surviving in the special conditions like antibiotics in the environment .",
    "this information can be encoded in plasmids , which are usually also circular and sometimes as large as chromosome .",
    "the difference between plasmid and chromosome is in the control of their replication .",
    "replication of chromosomes is both , positively and negatively controlled and perfectly synchronized with the cell division and simply it is impossible to imagine the living cell without chromosome - without plasmid it is possible .",
    "thus , we have to replicate the chromosome before we try to divide the cell .",
    "the topology of dna replication , even of such a small molecule as e. coli chromosome , is a good opportunity for mathematicians to exercise their imagination - usually the abstract thinking satisfies them entirely .",
    "imagine a rope in your living room , 1 cm in diameter and 10 km long , ends tied .",
    "the rope is made of two lines wrapped around themselves 500,000 times . during the replication you have to separate the two lines and to connect the new lines with each of the separated one .",
    "e. coli can do all that in 45 minutes . during this time it is able to build into the dna 10 millions new nucleotides ( five millions into each of the new strands ) . to make the exercise more demanding - e. coli can divide every 20 minutes in the favorable conditions and need 45 minutes to replicate its chromosome .",
    "after a few generations its genetic information would be diluted .",
    "do you imagine why it is not a case ?",
    "because the replication cycles start at 20 minute intervals , chromosome can replicate in many points simultaneously .",
    "schematic representation of dna replication .",
    "panel , , a  shows the loop close to origin of replication - oric where the replication starts in two directions . at this point",
    "the two dna strands have their , , switches  from leading to lagging mode of replication .",
    "the lower panel shows the differences in mechanisms and topology of replication of the leading and the lagging dna strands in the region of replication fork .",
    "the two replication forks shown in the upper panel will meet at the opposite pole of circular dna chromosome - terminus of replication .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the second problem is connected directly with the mechanism of dna replication .",
    "replication is performed by the specific biochemical machinery with a speed higher than 1000 nucleotides per second .",
    "this machinery is able to build the strand only in one direction from 5 to 3 end . additionally , synthesis of dna has to start with a primer - a short fragment of another kind of nucleic acid - rna .",
    "the topology of the double helix replication is shown in fig .",
    "double helix has two different ends of strands at each end .",
    "replication starts at the nonrandom point called , , origin of replication  ( ori ) and , at the beginning it proceeds only on one old strand starting from its 3 end . since the synthesized strand is antiparallel - the new strand has 5 end at the start point ( it is called , , leading strand  ) .",
    "the second old strand stay free - , , single stranded  until the replication move about 2000 nucleotides .",
    "then a starter is synthesized in the replication fork and the second new strand starts to synthesize - it is called , , lagging strand  .",
    "meantime the replication of the leading strand proceeds for further 1000 - 2000 nucleotides and another starter for the second fragment of lagging strand is synthesized .",
    "next , starters between dna fragments of lagging strands are cut off and gaps are filled up with deoxyribonucleotides .",
    "there are in fact two different mechanisms of dna replication - one for the leading strand and the other one for the lagging strand .",
    "of course , during the process of replication the new nucleotides are built into the new strand according to the rules of complementarity : a - t and g - c .",
    "there are many reasons in the whole process of replication for which more or less random errors are introduced during the replication when the rules of complementarity are not fulfilled .",
    "these errors - called mutations - are rather rare events , they happen with a frequency of the order of one per genome replication , independently of the genome size .",
    "the most frequent errors are substitutions , when the wrong nucleotide is placed in the new strand . for example instead of",
    "a opposite to t the g , c or t can be placed .",
    "there are three wrong choices for each of four nucleotides .",
    "thus , there are 12 different substitutions . since the mechanisms of replication of the leading and lagging strands are different , the distributions of the most often substitutions are also different .",
    "after many generations , the specific bias of substitutions results in the corresponding bias in the nucleotide composition of the two dna strands .",
    "they are complementary but their nucleotide compositions are different .",
    "we call this feature of dna - , , dna asymmetry  .",
    "it is easy to prove that dna is asymmetric .",
    "you remember chargaff s rules resulting from the complementarity , called sometimes parity rules i : the number of a equals t and the number of g equals c. these rules are deterministic .",
    "let s perform virtual experiment ; take a natural dna sequence , disrupt it for single nucleotides and remake the molecule drawing randomly nucleotides from the whole pool where initially the number a = t and g = c .",
    "if we try to build a dna molecule having such a balanced numbers of nucleotides , using them randomly but keeping the complementarity rules , we can expect that the number of a would equal t and the number of g would equal c in each strand , the differences should be statistically negligible .",
    "this stochastic rule is called parity rule ii .",
    "the natural dna molecules usually do not fulfill the parity rule ii - they are asymmetric . the simplest way to visualize",
    "the dna asymmetry is to perform the dna walk ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a - t and g - c dna walks . in the a - t type of a walk ,",
    "walker starts from the first nucleotide of the analyzed sequence and its moves are : a [ 1,1 ] , t[1,-1 ] , g[1,0 ] , c[1,0 ] ; in the g - c type of walk its moves are : a [ 1,0 ] , t[1,0 ] , g[1,1 ] , c[1,-1 ] .",
    "dna walks of this type show local and global asymmetry of dna molecule .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]     asymmetry of escherichia coli dna chromosome ; ( a ) - a - t and g - c dna walks performed for the real e. coli chromosome about 4.5 million base pairs long .",
    "walkers start at the terminus of replication , the extremes ( very well seen maximum for g - c walk ) are in the origin of replication region ; ( b ) - dna walks performed for the random dna sequence of the same general nucleotide composition as e. coli chromosome .",
    "no significant dna asymmetry is seen in the same scale .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we can put a walker on the first position of the dna strand and declare that it is moving in the two - dimensional space according to the rules : a [ 1,1 ] , t[1,-1 ] , g[1,0 ] , c[1,0 ] .",
    "in such a walk , called a / t walk , the walker is going up if there are more a than t in the strand . for the g / c walk the corresponding moves of the dna walker are : a [ 1,0 ] , t[1,0 ] , g[1,1 ] , c[1,-1 ] and walker is going up if there are more g than c in the dna strand .",
    "two examples of the dna analyses using the dna walks are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . the walk shown in panel b",
    "was done for random dna sequence of the global nucleotide composition characteristic for real e. coli chromosome but randomly distributed along the two strands obeying only the parity rule i ( complementarity ) .",
    "this is a sequence obtained in our , , virtual experiment",
    " described above .",
    "the second walk was done for the real e. coli chromosome .",
    "the , , real e. coli chromosome  means a sequence of nucleotides obtained during the experimental sequencing of e. coli chromosome , ( available in the genomic data bases ) .",
    "note that a sequence of nucleotides of one strand is different than the sequence of the other one but the first strand determines the sequence of the other one unambiguously .",
    "thus , it is enough to put the sequence of only one strand into the data bases .",
    "this strand is named the watson strand , the other one ( complementary ) is called the crick strand .",
    "the beginning of the circular chromosome is chosen arbitrarily and it is presented in the direction @xmath1 .",
    "it is just for better communication when describing some additional features or sequences on the chromosomes . comparing the last two dna walks ( randomly arranged sequences and the real one )",
    "it is clear that that e. coli chromosome does not obey the parity rule ii .",
    "it is asymmetric @xcite .",
    "it is divided by ori and ter regions for two parts , called replichores . at the points ori and",
    "ter the asymmetry changes its sign .",
    "again , comparing the topology of replication with the results of dna walks we can conclude that at the ori the dna strands change their role in replication from the leading to the lagging and vice versa . concluding ; two strands of one double helix dna molecule are under different mutation pressure and have different nucleotide composition .",
    "that is why it is important how genes - fragments of dna double helix - are positioned on such a molecule and how the information encoded into the dna is deciphered .",
    "the dna molecule is a data base of genetic information . to use it , the proper information from this data base",
    "should be retrieved , copied and translated into the function .",
    "usually , , , the function  is performed by the protein molecule composed of many subunits ( up to many thousands ) - amino acids .",
    "there are 20 different amino acids built into the proteins .",
    "we omit the problem of how , , the proper  information is found on the huge dna molecule and we will start just from the point of its copying . to express the desired information encoded in the sequence of deoxyribonucleotides , the very sequence is copied in the process called transcription into another nucleic acid - ribonucleic acid ( rna ) .",
    "there are some differences between dna and rna ; rna is single stranded , possesses ribose instead of deoxyribose and uracil ( u ) instead of t , complementing with a. rna is also synthesized from 5 to 3 end on the antiparallel dna strand ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .     transcription process .",
    "rna polymerase transcribes the antisense dna strand",
    ". the transcript - rna sequence - corresponds to the sense dna strand .",
    "notice that the direction of rna strand ( 5- 3 ) is the same as the direction of the dna sense strand .",
    "if in the left transcription bubble the sense dna strand is a leading strand - it is said that the genes is located on the leading strand but notice that the gene transcribed in the left bubble is located on the lagging strand and the direction of its transcription would be different that the direction of replication fork movement .",
    "this topology is very important for many mechanisms of gene expression.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    rna sequence suppose to have , , sense  thus , the antiparallel dna strand used as matrix for transcription is called antisense strand while the other one ( complementary ) is again called a sense strand .",
    "the position of sense strand of protein coding sequence and its direction describe the topological parameters of gene on chromosome .",
    "if the sense strand of gene is located on the leading strand , its transcription has the same direction as the replication fork movement and it is said that , , the gene  is located on the leading strand . if the sense strand is located on the lagging strand then the direction of transcription is opposite to the replication fork movement .",
    "the rna sequence is translated into amino acid sequence of proteins .",
    "the basis of the complicated decoding system is the genetic code .",
    "nucleic acid is composed of four different subunits while proteins are built of 20 different amino acids .",
    "that is why the genetic code has to use at least three nucleotides for coding one amino acid ( and really it uses tri - nucleotides ) resulting in 64 possible different triplets - much more than the minimum number .",
    "the tri - nucleotide coding one amino acid is called , , codon  ( or triplet ) .",
    "the meaning of all codons is shown in the table of genetic code ( fig .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .     * genetic code .",
    "* notice the way of construction the genetic code table ; codons are grouped in boxes - four codons in each box .",
    "four boxes in one column have the same second nucleotide in codons .",
    "four boxes in one raw have the same first nucleotide in codons .",
    "thus , four codons in one box differ only in the third codon positions .",
    "all four codons in each of grey boxes code for the same amino acid ( three letters abbreviations of the amino acid names are at the right side of codons ) . in all other cases",
    "pyrimidines in one box ( c or u ) code for the same amino acid and in only two cases different purines ( a or g ) change the meaning of codons .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    there are many peculiar properties of the genetic code .",
    "first of all the genetic code is universal which means that all organisms in biosphere use the same code . only some of them , usually with very small genomes , use some , , dialects  differing in the sense of single codons .",
    "we can state that all organisms communicate in the same language .",
    "the other properties of genetic code are : not overlapping , without any comas , with the fixed start and stop of translation , unambiguous and degenerate . for our purposes",
    "the last two features of the genetic code are very important .",
    "unambiguous means that any codon codes for only one amino acid while degeneration means that the same amino acid can be coded by more than one codon .",
    "one of the hypotheses of genetic code evolution assumes that initially the codon assignments varied and it was the selection pressure which optimized the code in respect to reduction of the harmful effects of mutations occurring during replication and transcription and to minimization the frequency of errors during translation process @xcite , @xcite for review see @xcite . during further evolution connected with the increase of genomes ,",
    "the genetic code was frozen @xcite and it was not possible to re - interpret the meaning of codons because every change would affect many amino acid positions in proteins and it would have catastrophic consequences for the organisms . as a result of such an evolution ,",
    "not only the degeneration of the genetic code is important but also the way it is degenerated .",
    "one mechanism of optimization results directly from the simple structural relations between nucleotides in the double helix - one large and one small nucleotide fit better to form a pair ( a rung in a ladder ) and it is much easier to overlook the mutation changing a small nucleotide for another small @xmath2 or large one for another large @xmath3 .",
    "these mutations are called transitions .",
    "the other kind of mutations , when small nucleotides are replaced by large ones or vice versa ( transversions ) , is much rarer .",
    "note that transitions in the third positions of codons change the sense of codons only in two cases : met / ile and trp / opal .",
    "all other transitions in the third positions are synonymous and even half of transversions in the third positions are synonymous .",
    "generally , mutations in the third codon positions are usually accepted by selection .",
    "furthermore , mutations in the first position could be also accepted because they change one amino acid for another one with similar chemical properties ( i.e. polarity , hydrophobicity ) .",
    "the most deleterious are mutations in the second positions of codons .",
    "such observations suggest that positions in codons vary in both , their role in coding as well as in the evolution rate , resulting in their nucleotide composition .      to analyze the nucleotide composition of coding sequences , the dna walks can be used . in this version of",
    "two - dimensional walks @xcite , the walkers moves are for : g - [ 0,1 ] , a - [ 1,0 ] , c - [ 0,-1 ] and t - [ -1,0 ] .",
    "the best results are obtained when the walks are generated separately for each position in codons ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "dna walks on protein coding sequences - spiders .",
    "there are three walks in the two - dimensional space .",
    "the first walker starts from the first nucleotide , the second walker from the second nucleotide and the third walker starts from the third nucleotide of the first codon .",
    "their jumps every three nucleotides on sequence correspond to moves accordingly to the nucleotide just visited : g - [ 0,1 ] , a - [ 1,0 ] , c - [ 0,-1 ] and t - [ -1,0 ] .",
    "each walker produces distinct walk called a spider leg numbered according to the position of nucleotides in analyzed codons.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to construct the dna walk for the first codon positions the walker starts from the first position of the first codon and jumps every three nucleotides until it reaches the first position of the stop codon . for the second codon position the walker starts from the second position of the first codon and for the third positions it starts from the third position of the first codon .",
    "three plots describing a coding sequence are called a spider @xcite .",
    "the first example of spider shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] represents three dna walks done for a single gene of e. coli .",
    "it is clear that the walks are different and correspond to different nucleotide composition of the three positions in codons .",
    "spiders for a single gene ( a ) and for all protein coding genes of e. coli located on the leading dna strand spliced together ( b ) .",
    "straight lines in the ( b ) panel suggest that the trends in nucleotide composition of all three positions in codons are universal at least for the genes located on this dna strand.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the second spider in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows walks constructed for all genes located on the leading strand of the e. coli genome spliced into one sequence .",
    "now , it is seen that trends for one gene are universal for the whole genome though , in larger scale .",
    "more about the analysis of coding capacities of genomes can be found at the web site : ` http://www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/www/dnawalk.html ` .",
    "such kinds of walks can be done also for analysis of distribution of specific codons @xcite , codons for specific amino acids or groups of amino acids @xcite or any other specific sequences occurring along the chromosomes , like sequences controlling or involved in the replication processes @xcite .",
    "the dna walks done for coding sequences show asymmetry of the coding sequences - a very specific asymmetry - different for each position in codons .",
    "it is obvious that this asymmetry is generated by selection which forces the specific amino acid composition of functional proteins and specific codons usage - if one amino acid is coded by more than one codon , some preferences of , , codon usage  are observed in the genome . a few sections above we have discussed the problem of dna asymmetry of replichores generated by different mutation pressures for leading and lagging strands .",
    "now it is time to understand what could be the consequence of specific location of coding sequence on chromosome - sense strand of gene located on the leading strand or on the lagging strand .",
    "imagine one example - leading strand is poor in c because this nucleotide is replaced by t preferentially on this strand .",
    "on the other hand , the second position of codons is reach in c and this position is very carefully watched by selection .",
    "if we put a coding sequence with sense strand reach in c on the leading strand , then it will be very vulnerable for mutations because the probability of substitution c by t is higher and such a substitution could be deleterious for the function of coded protein .",
    "coding sequences are under mutation pressure which depends on their location on chromosome and under selection pressure which demands the determined function of protein . analyzing any genome we see the results of compromise between these two forces .",
    "to characterize one force we have to describe the other one .",
    "we have succeeded in describing the mutation pressure for the genome of b. burgdorferi @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in fact",

    "it is necessary to consider the generation of stop codons inside the protein coding genes and elimination of start codons .",
    "both kinds of mutations shorten the coding sequences and it is legitimate to assume that they are deleterious and eliminate the gene . the probability of elimination of start codons is independent of the length of coding sequences because each coding sequence possesses only one start codon , while generation of stop codons inside coding sequences linearly depends on the number of codons . these specific properties and effects of substitutions allow estimating some parameters of mutational pressure .",
