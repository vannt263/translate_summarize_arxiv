    "what is the origin of the inhomogeneities we observe in the sky ? what is their typical wavelength ?",
    "how come that we are able to observe these inhomogeneities ? the term inhomogeneity is rather generic and it indicates , for the purpose of the present introduction , fluctuations both in the background geometry and in the energetic content of the universe . for simplicity , these inhomogeneities can be represented , for the purposes of the present introduction , by plane waves characterized by a comoving wave - number @xmath0 . since the evolution of the universe is characterized by a scale factor @xmath1 , a physical wave - number @xmath2 is also customarily defined .",
    "the comoving wave - number does not feel the expansion while the physical momentum is different at different epochs in the life of the universe . conversely the value of a given physical frequency is fully specified only by stating the time at which the physical frequency is `` measured '' .",
    "if a given fluctuation has a momentum comparable with the present value of the hubble parameter , ] i.e. @xmath3 , we will have that @xmath4 hz . fluctuations with momentum smaller that @xmath5 have a wave - length which is larger than the present value of the hubble radius and , therefore , they seem to be impossible to detect directly since the distance between two maxima ( or two minima ) of the wave will be , in this case , larger than our observable universe .    at the decoupling epoch the hubble rate is @xmath6 . the decoupling frequency red - shifted today will be @xmath7 .",
    "fluctuations of this typical frequency can be  detected \" through the study of the of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the rationale for this statement is that the fluctuations in the background geometry and in the density contrasts of the various species composing the primeval plasma may induce tiny spatial variations in the cmb temperature .",
    "the standard lore for the formation of the structures in the universe , is that the fluctuations detected by means of cmb temperature inhomogeneities will eventually collapse by gravitational instability to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    at the time of decoupling and , anyway prior to the recombination of free electrons with protons , the temperature of the universe was of the order of a fraction of the @xmath8 .",
    "the universe , all along its history , reached much higher temperature ( or , equivalently , much higher values of the expansion rate ) . at the epoch of the formation of light nuclei",
    "the temperature of the universe was of the order of a fraction of the @xmath9 and the corresponding value of the hubble expansion rate was of the order of @xmath10 . when ( and if ) the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition took place , the temperature of the universe was of the order of @xmath11 leading , approximately , to @xmath12 .",
    "comoving wave - numbers of the order of the hubble rate at the ew or at the bbn epoch correspond , today , to physical frequencies of the order of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . finally , in the context of the conventional inflationary paradigm the value of the hubble rate during inflation was @xmath15 . under the assumption",
    "the universe was dominated by radiation right after inflation , the present value of the correspoonding physical frequency was of the order of @xmath16 hz .    to `` observe '' fluctuations corresponding to present frequencies @xmath17 ,",
    "cmb anisotropy experiments can not be used .",
    "cmb anisotropy experiments are sensitive to present frequency scale only slightly higher than @xmath18 hz . for frequencies in the interval @xmath19 , the only hope of direct observations are the experiments on direct detection of stochastic backgrounds of gravitational radiation . in some specific configurations these instruments",
    "could detect not only tensor fluctuations of the geometry but also scalar and vector modes .",
    "the cosmological inhomogeneities are usually characterized by their correlation functions .",
    "the simplest correlation function encoding informations on the nature of the fluctuations is the two - point function whose fourier transform is usually called power spectrum .",
    "the two point function is computed by taking averages of the fluctuation amplitude at two spatially separated points but at the same time . from this quantity , with appropriate mathematical manipulations ,",
    "it is also possible to deduce other relevant physical quantities like , for instance , the energy density carried by these fluctuations .    from the physical scales discussed above ,",
    "one is led to conclude that the power spectrum of cosmological inhomogeneities is defined over a huge interval of frequencies .",
    "for instance , the tensor fluctuations of the geometry which only couple to the curvature and not to the matter sources of the universe have a spectrum ranging , in some specific models , from @xmath20 hz up to the ghz for , roughly 27 powers of ten .    from the figures obtained so far ,",
    "legitimate questions may be raised :    * given that the precise thermodynamical history of the universe above @xmath21 mev is unknown , how it is possible to have a reliable framework describing the evolution of the cosmological fluctuations ? *",
    "does it make sense to apply gr also up to curvature scales which are almost planckian ? *",
    "how is it possible to give sensible initial conditions to the various fluctuations of the geometry without having some handle on the theory of the initial singularity , i.e. the theory of the big - bang ?",
    "we do not have any ( even indirect ) test of the thermodynamical state of the universe for temperatures larger than the mev .",
    "the four light isotopes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are mainly produced at the big - bang nucleosynthesis below a typical temperature of @xmath26 mev when neutrinos decouple from the plasma and the neutron abundance evolves via free neutron decay .",
    "the abundances calculated in the simplest ( homogeneous and isotropic ) big - bang nucleosythesis model agree fairly well with the astronomical observations . this is the last indirect test of the thermodynamical state of the universe . for temperature larger than @xmath21 mev ,",
    "collider physics and the success of the electroweak standard model offer a precious handle up to the epoch of the electroweak phase transition occurring for temperatures of the order of @xmath27 gev .",
    "there is then the hope that our knowledge of particle physics could help us to fill the gap between the nucleosynthesis epoch and the physics beyond above the electroweak curvature scale .",
    "the evolution of inhomogeneities over cosmological distances may well be unaffected by our ignorance of the specific history of the expansion rate .",
    "the key concept is the one of conservation law . in the framework of einsteinian theories of gravity ( and in particular in gr",
    ") its is possible to show , on a rather general ground , that there exist conservation laws for the evolution of the fluctuations .",
    "these conservation laws are exact in the limit of vanishing comoving frequency , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this conclusion holds under the assuming that general relativity is a valid description throughout the whole evolution of the universe .",
    "similar properties also hold , with some modifications , in scalar - tensor theories of gravity ( of brans - dicke type ) like the ones suggested by the low - energy limit of superstring theory . the conservation laws of cosmological perturbations apply strictly in the case of the tensor modes of the geometry . in the case of the scalar fluctuations ,",
    "the precise form of the conservation law depends upon the matter content of the early universe since scalar fluctuations couple directly to the ( scalar ) matter sources .",
    "there is the hope that experiments aimed at the direct detection of stochastic backgrounds of relic gravitons will provide informations on the high - frequency behaviour of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "these informations could be , in principle , converted into valuable clues on the early evolution of the hubble rate .",
    "finally , there is no way of addressing the singularity problem in general terms .",
    "for instance , the conventional inflationary paradigm postulates that the evolution of the early universe was driven by the potential energy of a single ( scalar ) degree of freedom named the inflaton . during inflation ,",
    "the scale factor expands in an accelerated way ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "inflationary cosmology does `` predict '' a singularity in the far past of the universe , however , the effects of the singularity may well be invisible since the accelerated expansion of a quasi - de sitter space - time is able to dilute all the spatial gradients which may eventually arise at the time of the cosmological singularity , prior to the beginning of inflation . in conventional inflationary models",
    "the singularity is not addressed but it is just removed beyond our observational capabilities .    as a general remark",
    ", one can say that , in modern cosmology , when the description of the early universe is approached , many authors like to use a simplicity principle .",
    "this means , for instance , that instead of introducing many degrees of freedom in the description of the early universe , we are often biased towards the model containing the fewest number of degrees of freedom ( like in the case of single - field inflationary models ) .",
    "this is , however , not the typical situation arising in the context of the low - energy string effective action where various massless modes are simultaneously present .",
    "it is here useful to recall the opinion of r. feynman questioning the notion that simplicity should be a guiding principle in the search for truth about nature @xcite : `` ... the simplest solution , by far , would be nothing , that there should be nothing at all in the universe .",
    "nature is more inventive than that , so i refuse to go along thinking that it always has to be simple . ''",
    "the history of the studies on the cmb anisotropies and on the cosmological fluctuations is closely linked to the the history of the standard cosmological model ( see , for instance , the the textbooks by weinberg @xcite and by kolb and turner @xcite ) . in this introduction",
    "only few interesting points will be swiftly mentioned since the main scope of this review is not historical .",
    "furthermore , the second chapter of the excellent book @xcite of b. patridge describes in detail the excitement of experimental cosmology in the early sixties at the time when cmb was firstly discovered . in the he issue number 81 of the `` uspekhi fizicheskikh nauk '' , on the occasion of the seventy - fifth anniversary of the birth of a. a. friedmann",
    ", a number of rather interesting papers were published . among them",
    "there is a review article of the development of friedmannian cosmology by ya .",
    "b. zeldovich @xcite and the inspiring paper of lifshitz and khalatnikov @xcite on the relativistic treatment of cosmological perturbations .",
    "reference @xcite describes mainly friedmann s contributions @xcite .",
    "due attention should also be paid to the work of g. lematre @xcite that was also partially motivated by the debate with a. eddington @xcite . according to the idea of eddington the world evolved from an einstein static universe and",
    "so developed `` infinitely slowly from a primitive uniform distribution in unstable equilibrium '' @xcite .",
    "the point of view of lematre was , in a sense , more radical since he suggested , in 1931 , that the expansion really did start with the beginning of the entire universe .",
    "unlike the universe of some modern big - bang cosmologies , the description of lematre did not evolve from a true singularity but from a material pre - universe , what lematre liked to call `` primeval atom '' @xcite .",
    "the primeval atom was a unique atom whose atomic weight was the total mass of the universe .",
    "this highly unstable atom would have experienced some type of fission and would have divided into smaller and smaller atoms by some kind of super - radioactive processes .",
    "the perspective of lematre was that the early expansion of the universe could be a well defined object of study for natural sciences even in the absence of a proper understanding of the initial singularity .    during the development of the standard cosmological model",
    ", a recurrent theme has been the explanation of structures we observe in the universe .",
    "this problem goes under the name of the structure formation problem .",
    "the reviews of kodama and sasaki @xcite and of mukhanov , feldman and brandenberger @xcite contain some historical surveys that are a valuable introduction to this subject .    among the various ideas put forward through the years we wish to mention two contributions that are suitable in order to introduce some of the problems treated in the present article : the classic paper of sachs and wolfe on the possible generation of anisotropies in the cmb @xcite and a paper of sakharov @xcite where the concept of sakharov ( i.e. acoustic ) oscillations has been introduced .",
    "in @xcite the basic general relativistic effects leading to the anisotropy of the cmb were estimated assuming that the cmb itself had a cosmological origin .",
    "this effect is now one of the cornerstones of the physics of cmb anisotropies and , in light of its importance , it will be one of the first derivations of the present review . in @xcite",
    "the authors argued that galaxy formation would imply @xmath31 .",
    "however , subsequent calculations @xcite brought the estimate down to @xmath32 , closer to what experimentally observed .",
    "the paper of sakharov @xcite is rather intriguing if one thinks that it was written in 1965 , i.e. just at the time when the possible cosmological origin of cmb was recognized .",
    "sakharov was speculating on a model proposed earlier by zeldovich .",
    "the origin and details of the model are , today , rather unimportant .",
    "reference @xcite contained two ideas whose legacy , somehow unexpectedly , survived until the present day .",
    "the first idea is summarized in the abstract of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` a hypothesis of the creation of astronomical bodies as a result of gravitational instability of the expanding universe is investigated .",
    "it is assumed that the initial inhomogeneities arise as a result of _ quantum fluctuations _ ... '' .",
    "the model of zeldovich indeed assumed that the initial state of the baryon - lepton fluid was cold .",
    "so the premises were wrong , but , still , it is amusing to notice that today quantum fluctuations are what it is assumed as initial conditions in a variety of models present at a totally different curvature ( or energy ) scale as initial condition for the fluctuations of the geometry .    in a theoretical perspective ,",
    "refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite underline three important problems :    * the problem of initial conditions of the fluctuations of the gravitational inhomogeneities ( sections 4 and 6 ) ; * the problem of their evolution ( sections 5 and 7 ) ; * the problem of their imprint on the cmb temperature fluctuations ( sections 3 , 8) .    the sections quoted in connection with each of the previous items indicate where each of the mentioned topic is treated in the present article . due to the historical development of the subject",
    "some semantic ambiguities may also arise .",
    "for instance , the  initial conditions of the cmb anisotropies \" could be described either in terms of the amplitude of metric fluctuations around the time of matter - radiation equality ( i.e. in the late universe ) , or in terms of the normalization of the cosmological perturbations in the early universe .",
    "even if the present review is theoretically oriented , it is appropriate to give a swift account of our recent experimental knowledge of cmb anisotropies .",
    "a new twist in the study of cmb anisotropies came from the observations of the cobe satellite and , more precisely , from the dmr ( differential microwave radiometer ) instrument .",
    "the dmr was able to probe the angular power spectrum measures the degree of inhomogeneity in the temperature distribution per logarithmic interval of @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , a given multipole @xmath33 can be related to a given spatial structure in the microwave sky : small @xmath33 will correspond to low wavenumbers , high @xmath33 will correspond to larger wave - numbers but always around a present physical frequency of the order of @xmath34 hz . ]",
    "@xmath35 spectrum ( see section 8) up to @xmath36 ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . as the name says ,",
    "dmr was a differential instrument measuring temperature differences in the microwave sky .",
    "the angular separation @xmath37 of the two horns of the antenna is related to the maximal multipole probed in the sky according to the approximate relation @xmath38",
    ". this will give the angular separation in radians that can be easily related to the angular separation in degrees .    the angular separation explored by the cobe experiment",
    "were @xmath39 .",
    "after the cobe mission , various experiments attempted the exploration of smaller angular separation , i. e. larger multipoles .",
    "a definite convincing evidence of the existence and location of the first peak in the @xmath40 spectrum came from the boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite and dasi @xcite experiments .",
    "both boomerang and maxima were balloon borne ( bolometric ) experiments .",

    ", our understanding of the universe can be summarized in two sets of cosmological parameters : the first set of parameters refers to the homogeneous background , the second set of parameters to the inhomogeneities .",

    "the second set of parameters refers to the inhomogeneities . in the @xmath46cdm model",
    "the initial conditions for the inhomogeneities belong to a specific class of scalar fluctuations of the geometry that are called adiabatic and are characterized by the fourier transform of their two - point function , i.e. the power spectrum which is usually parametrized in terms of an amplitude and of a spectral slope . to these two parameters one usually adds the ratio between the amplitudes of the scalar and tensor modes of the geometry .",

    "having said this it is important to stress that the present article will not deal with the problem of data analysis ( or parameter extraction from the cmb data ) .",
    "the purpose of the present review , as underlined before in this introduction , will be to describe the theoretical tools allowing the calculation of large - scale temperature fluctuations in a broad range of cosmological models whose predictions may not always fall in the concordance model .",
    "finally a word of care concerning references . in reviewing this subject attention has been given to ideas emerged in the last ten years .",
    "for this reasons , various important works will only be indirectly quoted and the reader may refer to earlier review articles on the subject that have been already quoted and will be quoted again when needed . among the theoretical ideas reported here , for reasons of space two important topics have been omitted , i.e. the problem of cosmological inhomogeneities induced by cosmic defects and the problem of the ( late time ) fluctuations induced by inhomogeneous quintessence models .",
