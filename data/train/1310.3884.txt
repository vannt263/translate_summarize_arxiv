    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are instrumental as distance indicators on a cosmic scale to determine the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "they are widely believed to be caused by thermonuclear explosions of carbon / oxygen white dwarfs ( c / o wds ) in binary systems .",
    "the two favored classes of sn ia progenitors are the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario and double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario . in the dds , two c / o",
    "wds merge due to gravitational wave radiation , leading to a sn ia thermonuclear explosion ( dd scenario , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the sd scenario ,",
    "wds accrete h / he - rich matters from companions that could be main - sequence ( ms ) stars , sub - giants , red giants ( rgs ) or he stars .",
    "they ignite sn ia explosions when approaching the chandrasekhar - mass ( @xmath1 ) limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , some observational and hydrodynamical studies ( see , e.g. , ) support the viability of dd scenario .",
    "there are some observational indications ( see , e.g. , ) , suggesting that the progenitors of some sne ia may come from the sd scenario .",
    "however , the exact nature of sn ia progenitors remains uncertain ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the spectra of normal sne ia are characterized by the absence of h and he lines and a strong silicon absorption feature . to date , no direct observation shows the signature of h lines in late - time , nebular spectra of sne ia @xcite .",
    "one of the signatures of the sd scenario is that the sn ia explosion is expected to remove h / he - rich material from its non - degenerate companion star @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations with a classical sn ia explosion model ( i.e. , the w7 model , see @xcite ) showed that about @xmath2 h - rich material are expected to be stripped off from a ms companion star by the impact of the sn  ia ejecta ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "almost the whole envelope of a rg companion ( @xmath3 ) is removed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of stripped h is significantly above the most stringent upper limits on non - detection of h ( @xmath40.010.03@xmath5 , see @xcite ) which were derived from observations of normal sne  ia .",
    "moreover , @xcite obtained a lower limit of @xmath6 on detection of stripped h for sn 2011fe which is the nearest sn ia in the last 25 years and has been observed in unprecedented detail .",
    "therefore , the absence of @xmath7 in late time nebular spectra of sne ia poses some problems for the sd scenario and favors other progenitor channel such as wd merger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , all previous hydrodynamical simulations were performed with the classical w7 explosion model which is suitable for normal sne ia in nickel production and kinetic energy .",
    "sn 2002cx - like sne are spectroscopically peculiar and faint objects compared to other sne ia .",
    "their spectra are characterized by very low expansion velocities and show strong mixing of the explosion ejecta @xcite . moreover , sn 2002cx - like sne are proposed to originate from chandrasekhar mass deflagrations , i.e. , sd h - accreting progenitors .",
    "very recently , @xcite performed hydrodynamics ( see also @xcite ) and radiative - transfer calculations for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) full - star pure deflagration model ( i.e. , the n5def model , see @xcite ) which is able to reproduce the characteristic observational features of sn 2005hk ( a prototypical 2002cx - like sn ia ) . in the n5def model , only a part of the @xmath1 wd , @xmath8 , is ejected with a much lower kinetic energy ( @xmath9 ) than models for normal sne ia .",
    "the thermonuclear explosion fails to completely unbind the wd and leaves behind a bound remnant of @xmath10 which consists mainly of unburned c / o ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the small amount of kinetic energy released in this pure deflagration model might significantly decrease the stripped companion mass , potentially avoiding a signature of h lines in late - time spectra of sn 2002cx - like sne ia .    here",
    "we calculate the amount of stripped h for the n5def model ( which is the best current model for sn 2002cx - like sne  ia ) in the sd scenario using 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of the sn ejecta on ms companion stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : code ] , we describe the methods and codes used in this work .",
    "section  [ sec : simulations ] presents the results from hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the distribution of the unbound mass from population synthesis calculations is shown in section  [ sec : bps ] .",
    "some discusions based on results of impact simulations are presented in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the basic results of simulations in section  [ sec : summary ] .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to construct a detailed companion structure at the moment of the sn ia explosion , we used the same method as described in @xcite to trace binary evolution in which a wd accretes h - rich material from a ms companion star ( i.e. , wd+ms @xmath1 explosion scenario ) .",
    "we think the wd would explode as a sn ia when its mass increases to the @xmath1 limit . here",
    ", we adopted the eggleton s stellar evolution code , roche - lobe overflow and the optically thick wind model of @xcite were included into the code to treat mass transfer in the binary . with a series of consistent binary evolution calculations",
    ", we selected four companion star models as input models of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "these four companion stars were constructed with different initial wd masses , companion masses and orbital periods ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) , which leads to companion models different in mass , orbital period and detailed structure at the moment of the sn explosion .",
    "four companion models created in 1d binary evolution calculations are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] , their radial mass profiles are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we then performed 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of sn ia ejecta on the companion star employing the sph code stellar  gadget @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "all initial conditions and basic setup for the impact simulations are the same as those in @xcite .",
    "we use the healpix method described in @xcite to map the 1d profiles of density and internal energy of a 1d companion star model to a particle distribution suitable for the sph code .",
    "before we start the actual impact simulations , the sph model of each companion star is relaxed for several dynamical timescales to reduce numerical noise introduced by the mapping .",
    "a comparison of density profiles between the 1d stellar model and its consistent sph model for model_a are shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the sn ia explosion was represented by the pure deflagration model of @xcite ( i.e. , the n5def model ) .",
    "this model has been shown to reproduce the characteristic observational features of 2002cx - like sne ia well @xcite . in this simulation ,",
    "only the @xmath11 of ejected material with a total kinetic energy of @xmath12 were used to represent the sn ia explosion , we did not include the @xmath13 bound remnant of the @xmath1 wd into the simulations .",
    "based on the angle averaged 1d ejecta structure of the n5def model , sph particles were placed randomly in shells to reproduce the mass ( density ) profile and gain the radial velocities they should have at their positions .",
    "the composition of a particle was then set to the values of the initial 1d model at a radius equal to the radial coordinate of the particle . here , the effect a mild degree of asymmetry caused by off - center pure deflagration explosion of a @xmath1 wd was ignored .",
    "however , only in the direction opposites to the one - sided ignition region the velocities are somewhat lower @xcite .",
    "the orientation of an asymmetry of sn ejecta plays an inefficient role in mass stripping by the time of interaction with the companion .",
    "we used @xmath14 million sph particles to represent the he companion stars in all simulations of this work . because all sph particle was set up with the same mass , the number of particles representing the supernova explosion is then fixed .",
    "the supernova was placed at a distance to the companion star given by the separation at the moment of sn ia explosion in our 1d binary - evolution calculations .",
    "the impact of the sn ia ejecta on their binary companions was then simulated for 5000 s , at which point the mass stripped off from the companion star and its kick velocity due to the impact have reached constant values .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho ] shows the typical evolution of the density distribution in the impact simulations for the companion star model_a .",
    "compared to our previous hydrodynamical simulations for the same ms companion star model ( but with a different explosion model , see @xcite ) , the basic impact processes are quite similar .",
    "the sn explodes at the right side of the companion star . after the sn explosion ,",
    "the sn ejecta expand freely for a while and hit the ms companion star , removing solar - metallicity companion material and forming a bow shock .",
    "subsequently , the bow shock propagates through the companion star , causing an additional loss of h - rich companion material from the far side of the star . finally , the final unbound h - rich material of the companion star caused by the sn impact is largely embedded in low - velocity sn debris behind the companion star , and the strongly impacted companion starts to relax to become almost spherical again .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    after the sn explosion , the non - degenerate companion star is significantly hit by the sn ejecta .",
    "the sn impact remove h - rich material from outer layers of the companion star through the ablation ( sn heating ) and the stripping ( momentum transfer ) mechanism .",
    "the late - time spectra of sn ia probably show a signature of h lines if a large amount of h - rich material can be stripped from the companion star during the interaction with the sn ejecta . to calculate the amount of final unbound companion mass due to the sn impact",
    ", we sum the masses of all unbound sph particles ( ablated+stripped particles ) that originally belongs to the companion star at the end of the simulations .    for four different ms companion star models , our impact simulations show that the companion star received a kick velocity of @xmath15 ( model_d)@xmath16 ( model_a ) at the end of the simulations .",
    "moreover , only a small amount of @xmath17 ( model_c)@xmath18 ( model_d ) of h - rich material is removed ( ablation+stripping ) from the companion stars due to the sn impact ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .    for a comparison ,",
    "numerical results for a classical explosion model of a @xmath1 wd for normal sne ia , the w7 model , are also shown in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "because the n5def model does not burn the complete wd but leaves behind a @xmath19 bound remnant , it produces a much lower kinetic energy ( @xmath12 ) than the w7 model ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , a much smaller amount of h - rich material of only @xmath21 is removed from the companion stars by the impact of the pure deflagration explosion of a @xmath1 wd .",
    "in contrast , the amount of final unbound companion mass is more than ten times larger ( @xmath22 ) for the w7 explosion model with the same companion star models at the same separations .",
    "a large amount of unbound companion mass in the impact simulations for the w7 explosion model seems to indicate that normal sne ia are not likely produced from the wd+ms @xmath1 explosion scenario ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    ", it is shown that the mass stripping is inefficient for 2002cx - like sne ia due to the low kinetic energies of off - center pure deflagration explosions of a @xmath1 wd , leading to that a amount of unbound companion material caused by the sn impact is quite small .",
    "therefore , the h lines probably be hidden in late - time spectra of sn 2002cx - like sne ia . however , whether or not such small amount of stripped h mass would expect to show a signature of h lines in late - time spectra of sn 2002cx - like sne ia , which needs to analyze late - time spectra of 2002cx - like sne to obtain the lower limit of stripped mass for detecting the h lines",
    "different wd+ms binary systems evolve to different evolutionary stages and have different binary parameters when the wd explodes as an sn ia .",
    "consequently , the companion radius and binary separation of binary systems differ significantly from the ms companion models used in our present simulations .",
    "we therefore investigated the dependence of the numerical results on the ratio of binary separation to the companion radius ( @xmath23 ) at the time of the explosion . here",
    ", we used the same method as in @xcite to artificially adjust the binary separations for a fixed companion star model ( which means that all parameters but the orbital separation are kept constant ) .",

    "the solid and dash - dotted line show results of the models with @xmath28 and @xmath29 in wlh10.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig : fit ] presents the amount of final unbound companion mass and kick velocity as a function of the parameter of @xmath23 for four companion star models .",
    "it shows that the unbound mass and kick velocity significantly decrease when increasing the orbital separation of the binary .",
    "generally , these relations can be fitted with power law functions in good approximation ( see figure  [ fig : fit ] ) :    @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the binary separation , @xmath33 is the radius of the ms companion star at the onset of the sn explosion . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two constant , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the power - law indices ( see table  [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite(hereafter wlh10 ) performed comprehensive binary population synthesis ( bps ) calculations obtaining a large sample of wd+ms sn ia progenitor models .",
    "they predicted many properties of the companion stars and binary systems at the moment of the sn explosion ( e.g. the companion masses , the companion radii , the orbital periods , etc ) .",
    "the distributions of the ratio of binary separations to the companion radii ( @xmath23 ) in the wlh10 sample ( their model with @xmath38 ) are presented in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "it shows that most systems are concentrated at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "based on the distribution of @xmath23 , we calculated the final unbound companion masses ( and kick velocities ) due to the sn impact by adopting the power law relations of four companion star models in figure  [ fig : fit ] , which are displayed in figure  [ fig : bps ] . as it is shown , the impact of off - center pure deflagration explosions of @xmath1 wds lead to a small amount of mass loss of the companion star ( @xmath41 ) in almost all wd+ms binary systems from bps calculations .",
    "moreover , the sn impact delivers a small kick velocity of @xmath42 to the companion star .    in section  [ sec",
    ": code ] , initial ms companion star models were set up with a h abundance of @xmath43 , a he abundance of @xmath44 and a metallicity of @xmath45 when we constructed the ms companion star model at the moment of the sn explosion .",
    "therefore , pure deflagrations of the @xmath1 wds strip off a small amount of pure h of @xmath46 from the companion stars in almost all wd+ms models .",
    "these small stripped h masses are consistent with the lower mass limit for detecting @xmath7 emission lines in nebular spectra of normal sne ia ( @xmath47 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the inefficient mass stripping seems to imply the stripped h may be hidden in ( observed ) late - time spectra of most of sn 2002cx - like sne ia .",
    "however , only normal sne ia were looked at when @xcite obtained the upper limit for non - detection of stripped @xmath7 of @xmath47 , the observational limits for sn 2002cx - like sne may be smaller / larger than the value for normal sne ia . most of stripped h - rich material in this simulations ends up at velocities below @xmath48 so that it is confined to the innermost part of explosion ejecta . whether or not @xmath7 emission will be detectable ,",
    "can only be answered by performing sophisticated radiative transfer simulations on the abundance structure of our explosion models .",
    "to test influence of the ratio of binary separation to the companion radius of @xmath23 , we artificially adjusted the binary separation for a fixed companion star model .",
    "the final unbound mass due to the sn impact decreases by a factor of 10 as the parameter of @xmath23 increases by a factor of 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit ] shows that the fitting parameters of four different companion models are different , which indicates that the companion structure results from the characteristics of the original binary system and the details of the mass transfer also can affect the final unbound mass . in reality",
    ", the companion structure is not independent on the binary separation in the binary evolutions . therefore , the companion structure would be different with different @xmath23 from bps calculations .    in section  [ sec : bps2 ]",
    ", we only used the same power - law relation obtained from a fixed companion star model ( for example , the power - law relation in model_a ) to calculate the total mass loss of the companion star caused by the sn impact for all wd+ms models , which ignores the influence of details of the companion structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : bps ] show that a comparison of the results that calculated by using four different power - law relations between the final unbound mass ( and the kick velocities ) and the parameter of @xmath23 in model_a , model_b , model_c , and model_d . some differences ( but not big differences ) in the distribution of final unbound masses",
    "are seen in figure  [ fig : bps]a , c , which implies that the parameter of @xmath23 is not the only factor to determine the final stripped companion mass , the companion structure can also affect the results .      for a comparison",
    ", we performed the impact simulations for the same companion star by adopting both the n5def model and the w7 explosion model to represent the sn ia explosion .",
    "a factor of 10 lower explosion energy in the n5def model leads to the stripped material reduced by a factor of 10 ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite investigated the influence of the sn explosion energy on the interaction with the companion star .",
    "they also found that explosion energy range covers a factor of 2 therefore leads to the unbound companion mass varies by a factor of 2 .",
    "these results indicate that the sn explosion energy have only a small effect on the total mass loss of the companion star as compared to the effect of the parameter of @xmath23 discussed above .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the binary separation to the radius of companion star ( @xmath23 ) is the most important parameter to determine the final unbound companion mass ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sn 2002cx was discovered as a new class of peculiar sne ia by @xcite . from a volume - limited sample of the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) ,",
    "@xcite estimate that sn 2002cs - like sne ia contribute at about 5 per cent to the total sn ia rate .",
    "very recently , @xcite concluded that `` sne iax '' ( the prototype of which is sn 2002cx sne ) are the most common `` peculiar '' class of sne , they estimated that in a given volume sne iax could contribute @xmath49 of total sne ia .",
    "nonetheless , to date , only 25 sne iax are confirmed that they are observationally similar to its prototypical member , sn 2002cx ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this sample consists of 25 members is a very small fraction of total sne ia . in this work",
    ", the results obtained from the impact simulations only apply to the subclass of peculiar 2002cx - like sne but not the bulk of sne ia .",
    "therefore , even the off - center pure deflagration explosion of a @xmath1 wd removes h - rich material during the interaction with the ms companion star , the h stripped from the companion star may not be observed in the ejecta of such relatively rare events .      in this work",
    ", the n5def pure deflagration model was used to represent the sn ia explosion in our impact simulations .",
    "the hydrodynamics calculations of @xcite and @xcite showed that the n5def model does not burn the complete wd but leaves behind a @xmath50 bound remnant .",
    "unfortunately , this bound remnant can not be properly spatially resolved until late time in hydrodynamical simulations due to the strong expansion of the sn ejecta .",
    "our simulations show that the companion star receives a small kick velocity ( @xmath51 ) during the interaction with the sn ejecta .",
    "therefore , whether the wd+ms binary system would be destoried after the sn explosion , which depends primarily on the kick velocity of the bound remnant . if the bound remnant receives a large kick velocity that can overcome its gravitational force , the existence of abundance - enriched ms - like stars and wds with peculiar spatial velocities are indicators ( @xcite ) of this studied progenitor scenario . otherwise , the new binary system would survive the sn explosion . in this study",
    ", it is found that the post - impact radii of companions at @xmath52 after the explosion are larger than the initial binary separations used for the impact simulations due to their extreme expansions caused by the sn heating .",
    "this indicates that the surviving binary system may evolve and merge into a single object with a rapid rotation velocity , or experience a common envelope phase .",
    "the details of this post - explosion evolution should be addressed in future work",
    ". however , fully resolving the detailed structure of the bound remnants is a prerequisite for this investigation .",
    "we presented 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of sn ia explosions on their companion stars for the wd+ms scenario for the pure deflagration model presented in @xcite . for four different companion star models , we find that the much lower kinetic energy of the pure deflagration model compared to models for normal sne ia leads to a much lower stripped h - rich mass of only @xmath53@xmath54 .    moreover , using the distribution of @xmath23 from bps calculations , we discussed the distribution of the amount unbound h - rich material of the companion star using a power law relation between the total unbound mass and the ratio of binary separation to the companion radius ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we find that the off - center pure deflagration explosions strip off a small amount of h ( @xmath46 ) from ms companion stars in most wd+ms progenitor models of sn 2002cx - like sne  ia .",
    "the inefficient mass stripping may lead to the stripped h is fully hidden in their late - time spectra .",
    "therefore , it will be very interesting to analyze late - time spectra of 2002cx - like sne  ia for the presence of hydrogen emission .",
