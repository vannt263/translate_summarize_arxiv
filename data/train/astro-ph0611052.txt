    "single dish c@xmath1o , so and ch@xmath2oh spectra ( cso , @xmath1030 beam , @xcite ) tend to show more prominent emission in the red wing , suggesting that there is a significant extended component which is resolved out by the interferometer . the remaining lines ( ch@xmath2oh , ch@xmath2cn , @xmath0cs , ocs ) as well as the cores of the lines associated with wing emission are resolved , with fwhms around 3  km / s .",
    "mm2 and mm4 are not seen in any of the lines .",
    "complex organic molecules are thought to form in the dense , dusty environments around young protostars as the products of grain surface chemistry evaporate and react with each other @xcite .",

    "the detection of the @xmath35 and 5 lines ( @xmath36 and 247  k ) suggest a temperature of more than 100  k , and their brightness with respect to the lower @xmath23 lines limit the temperature to less than 200  k. the @xmath37 , and 3 lines are of similar brightness , which suggests that they are somewhat optically thick ( for the adopted temperature range , the @xmath38 line ( @xmath39  k ) should be clearly brighter than the @xmath40 line if optically thin , due to its high statistical weight ) . the observed line intensities then imply a ch@xmath2cn column density of the order of a few times 10@xmath41@xmath42 and a source size of the order of 04 , i.e. , 150 - 200  au .",
    "this is significantly smaller and somewhat cooler than ch@xmath2cn emission regions found in hot cores in massive star forming regions ( e.g. , w3(h@xmath8o ) , @xcite ) but is is comparable to the hot corinos which have now been found in a handful of other low - mass protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "only channels in which emission above 5@xmath43 is seen are used .",
    "we chose to use only ch@xmath2cn and ocs lines in this plot as it is these molecules where we see the least contamination by outflow related emission .",
    "overall , the positions of the emission maxima define a south - east to north - west oriented , elongated structure ( position angle @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is unlikely to be the result of positional measurement errors , as this would tend to produce a distribution which is elongated along the beams major axis , which is at a position angle of about 75@xmath21 .",
    "there is a clear trend for the lower velocity center positions to cluster to the south - east of the mm1 central position , and the higher velocity positions to be found to its north - west . to illustrate this further , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_veloffsets ] shows the channel velocities as a function of the offset along the disk plane .",
    "although the positional errors are larger than the offsets , a trend for velocities increasing from sout - east to north - west is consistently seen in all transitions . clearly , better data are needed to confirm this observation .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the positional arrangement of the emission maxima indicates a flattened structure around the protostellar source embedded in mm1 ; a similar result has been obtained by @xcite for the intermediate - mass protostar iras20126@xmath254104 , and has been interpreted as evidence for a circumstellar disk .",
    "the velocity gradient hints at rotation , with a rotation axis being roughly parallel to the axis of the outflow from mm1 .",
    "this would imply that the ch@xmath2cn and ocs emission arises from grain mantle evaporation in a heated disk rather than the dense , infalling envelope .",
    "however , higher angular resolution observations resolving the source is required to discriminate between these scenarios ( is it spherical or flattened ? )",
    "also , neither the angular resolution nor the velocity resolution nor the sensitivity of our data are good enough to derive estimates of the central object s mass or the size of the disk .",
    "we have presented new 1.3  mm dust continuum and molecular line observations of the l1641-n cluster area .",
    "single - dish wide field co mapping revealed the presence of several blue- and red - shifted outflow lobes , which can be grouped into at least 4 bipolar flows : a north - south oriented giant outflow b - n / r - s , driven most likely by the an04 iso source 18 ; a shorter north - east to south - west oriented outflow b - ne / r - w driven by the dominant millimeter continuum source in the cluster center ; another parsec scale outflow b - e / r - e / r - sw corresponding to the h@xmath8 flow 51 of smz2002 , driven by an embedded iso and millimeter source east of the cluster center ; and a small flow b - se / r - se driven by a near - infrared star south - east of the cluster center .",
    "moreover , some co outflow activity might also be associated with the strom  11 group further south - east of the l1641-n cluster center ( b - se2 ) .",
    "the sma observations show that there are in fact two deeply embedded sources in the very cluster center , mm1 and mm3 , each of which drives a co outflow , which together make up the b - ne / r - w outflow : mm1 is at the center of two cavity - shaped outflow lobes seen at moderate co velocities , and mm3 drives a collimated , faint jet seen only at high velocities .",
    "the flow from mm1 carries more mass as only this flow is seen in the optically thin @xmath0co .",
    "we find @xmath0co , c@xmath1o , and @xmath0cs emission tracing the core from which mm1 and mm3 are forming , ch@xmath2oh and so emission tracing the protostellar sources mm1 and mm3 as well as their outflows , and ocs and ch@xmath2cn emission from mm1 .",
    "analysis of the ch@xmath2cn @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) lines suggests that the emitting gas traces a compact ( 100 - 200  au ) , warm ( 100 - 200  k ) region deep inside the mm1 envelope",
    ". this could be the warm , innermost portion of the infalling envelope , i.e. , a hot corino , as seen in other low - mass protostars .",
    "alternatively , it may be the the heated surface layer of a disk , as suggested by our tentative detection of a velocity gradient over the ch@xmath2cn source perpendicular to the mm1 outflow axis .",
    "widespread co line - wing emission is seen virtually over the entire cluster core area . in total",
    ", we estimate that a few solar masses of molecular gas have been set into motion . this estimate does not include corrections for optical depth effects or outflow gas having low radial velocities",
    ", however , so the total outflow mass might well be larger by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "the flows are estimated to carry @xmath1016  m@xmath48  km  s@xmath34 of momentum and a kinetic energy of 75  m@xmath48  km@xmath49s@xmath50 , which are lower limits again ; correcting the mass for optical depth and for co with v@xmath51 about 0 , and correcting the velocities for inclination might well increase these values by more than an order of magnitude .    in clusters of low mass stars",
    ", protostellar outflows can impart a significant amount of energy and momentum into their surroundings and , perhaps , thereby regulate the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "they may also play an important role in replenishing turbulence , which hydrodynamic as well as magnetohydrodynamic simulations suggest decays on timescales comparable to a clouds free - fall timescale @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to maintain turbulence , kinetic energy and momentum has to be provided by the flow at a high enough rate to compensate for the loss due to the decay of turbulence .",
    "the mass of the l1641-n cluster forming core is a few times 100  m@xmath48 @xcite , a certain part of which is in the still inactive tail extending south - east of l1641-n / strom  11 ; the actual mass involved in directly building the l1641-n cluster might be about 100 - 200  m@xmath48 . using a cloud radius of about 0.5  pc ( estimated from the map shown by @xcite ) and a mass @xmath53 of 200  @xmath32 yields @xmath54yr . we estimate a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath55 of 0.94  km  s@xmath34 for the l1641-n cloud core based on the addition ( in quadrature ) of the intrinsic core dispersions of 0.72  km  s@xmath34 and core - core motion , 0.6  km  s@xmath34 in @xcite ; cores 67 and 69 ) . the rate @xmath56 at which kinetic energy is lost due to decaying turbulence is then estimated to be 0.1  l@xmath48 ( where @xmath57 ) .    the momentum available in the co flows has the potential to add significant motions to the cloud core . if the forward momentum were completely transferred to the 200  m@xmath48 of core gas , it would accelerate it by at least @xmath100.1  km  s@xmath34 and possibly up to the cloud velocity dispersion with the corrections mentioned above .",
    "in addition , sideways motions can be excited , which does not affect the flows forward oriented momentum . in terms of energy supply , even the ( lower limit on ) @xmath58 of 1.21  @xmath59 is greater than @xmath60 . however , a large fraction of that can be expected to be dissipated in shocks .",
    "the rate @xmath61 at which the cloud gas gains energy , taking into account radiative losses , can be estimated as follows : we assume that all of the outflow forward momentum is dumped in the clump and used to drive the turbulence , and that the outflows accelerate a fraction @xmath62 of the clump s mass to a velocity equal to the clump s three - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath63 .",
    "the clump mass set in motion per unit time is then @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the sum of outflow momentum input rates .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 where @xmath55 is the observed , one - dimensional velocity dispersion . with @xmath55 of 0.94  kms@xmath34 and the sum of outflow momentum rates of @xmath67  kms@xmath34yr@xmath34 from table 1",
    "the energy gain rate is @xmath68 .",
    "this result is comparable to the estimate of the clouds rate of energy loss @xmath69 , particularly if keeping in mind that the outflow mass and velocity measurements are lower limits due to optical depth and projection , respectively .",
    "the above calculation indicates that the molecular outflows can indeed provide sufficient energy and momentum to sustain cloud turbulence .",
    "protostellar outflows are known to be collimated . in regions forming only a small number of isolated and well separated protostars",
    ", the outflow will only affect a small fraction of the total cloud volume and their impact is therefore relatively small .",
    "however , in regions of clustered star formation , the protostellar density is higher and a larger fraction of the cloud volume will be affected .",
    "we have found wide - spread co line - wing emission in l1641-n , indicating that the presence of several co outflows does affect a significant volume of the cluster core . in ngc  1333 , @xcite found a system of cavities permeating the cloud and suggested , if these are relic outflow events , then @xmath47% of the cloud was affected .",
    "@xcite found that most of the co line wing emission in the omc-2 and omc-3 star forming regions is in broadly dispersed , extended features , which also suggests that a large fraction of the cloud volume is affected by outflows . from the small fraction of the high velocity emission in young , compact outflows , and using a calculation similar to the above , they also estimated that the energy injection rate was sufficient to maintain cloud turbulence .",
    "l1641-n , ngc  1333 , and omc-2/3 are regions forming modest sized clusters of a few tens to hundreds of stars . in the case of l1641-n",
    ", @xcite showed that star formation has been going on for about 10@xmath5  years at 23 stars every 10@xmath4 years . assuming that protostars drive powerful co outflows over the first 12@xmath910@xmath4 years of their evolution",
    ", the 5 co outflows we found in the region suggest that star formation is continuing at a similar pace .",
    "ngc  1333 also shows evidence for star formation over million year time scales @xcite , which is still going on , and even the ic  348 cluster might still be in the buildup phase @xcite .",
    "these modest sized cluster forming regions typically feature a handful to one to two dozens of energetic outflows . assuming that the formation of a more massive cluster ( few thousand or ten thousand stars ) also proceeds more or less steadily over a few million years rather than in one short burst",
    ", then one can expect that at any time there are many tens or hundreds of stars in their youngest evolutionary stage and driving very energetic outflows .",
    "it can then be expected that virtually the entire cluster volume is affected by outflow activity .",
    "the action of a population of outflows from low - mass protostars might also have consequences for high - mass star formation . in the ` turbulent core ' scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , massive stars form from high density cores formed within a high pressure , turbulent clump .",
    "accretion rates are high enough to overcome the radiation pressure of the central object .",
    "the formation time scale @xmath70 is comparable to the free fall timescale of the surrounding clump , i.e. , to the timescale of turbulence decay .",
    "hence it might not really be crucial to maintain the turbulence _ while _ the massive star forms .",
    "but it might be a prerequisite , to keep the turbulence in the high pressure environment _ until _ the massive star forming core has formed and reached the point when it starts to collapse .",
    "the ` competitive accretion ' scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) requires that gas falls into the central region of a forming cluster , allowing the protostars to grow beyond the masses of their original envelopes .",
    "this infall might be counteracted by outflows from the protostars in the cluster center .",
    "furthermore , @xcite claim that competitive accretion and collisional growth of protostars @xcite requires efficient removal of kinetic energy from the cluster forming gas , which could also be prevented by low - mass protostars outflows .",

    "<S> we present results of 1.3  mm interferometric and single - dish observations of the center of the l1641-n cluster in orion . </S>",
    "<S> single - dish wide - field continuum and co(2 - 1 ) observations reveal the presence of several molecular outflows driven by deeply embedded protostellar sources . at higher angular resolution , the dominant millimeter source in the cluster center is resolved into a pair of protostars ( l1641-n - mm1 and mm3 ) , each driving a collimated outflow , and a more extended , clumpy core . </S>",
    "<S> low - velocity co line - wing emission is widely spread over much of the cluster area . </S>",
    "<S> we detect and map the distribution of several other molecular transitions ( @xmath0co , c@xmath1o , @xmath0cs , so , ch@xmath2oh , ch@xmath2cn , and ocs ) . </S>",
    "<S> ch@xmath2cn and ocs may indicate the presence of a hot corino around l1641-n - mm1 . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively identify a velocity gradient over l1641-n - mm1 in ch@xmath2cn and ocs , oriented roughly perpendicular to the outflow direction , perhaps indicative of a circumstellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the energy and momentum load of the co outflows , along with the notion that apparently a large volume fraction is affected by the multiple outflow activity , suggests that outflows from a population of low - mass stars might have a significant impact on clustered ( and potentially high - mass ) star formation . </S>"
