    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start up in few months .",
    "currently , there is a great expectation that lhc will discover the higgs boson and whatever new physics beyond the standard model that may accompany it , such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , several questions remain open in the standard model , which will be probed in a new kinematical regime at the lhc and will determine the background for new physics .",
    "in particular , the description of the high - energy regime of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) still is a subject of intense debate ( for recent reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in recent years",
    "we have proposed the analysis of coherent collisions in hadronic interactions as an alternative way to study the qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in coherent hadronic collisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators ( for a review see ref .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath1 interactions at the lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the photon - hadron interactions in hadron - hadron collisions can be divided into exclusive and inclusive reactions . in the first case ,",
    "a certain particle is produced while the target remains in the ground state ( or is only internally excited ) .",
    "on the other hand , in inclusive interactions the particle produced is accompanied by one or more particles from the breakup of the target .",
    "the typical examples of these processes are the exclusive vector meson production and the inclusive heavy quark production , described by the processes @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "recently , we have discussed both processes considering @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite collisions as an alternative to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "our results demonstrate that their detection is feasible at the lhc .",
    "however , some of these results were obtained considering the saturation model proposed by golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) several years ago @xcite .",
    "that model has been improved recently considering the current state - of - the - art of saturation physics : the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates a revision of some our previous estimates .",
    "in particular , in this paper we revise our predictions for @xmath0-meson photoproduction in coherent @xmath8 collisions . we show that the rapidity distribution at rhic is strongly dependent on the behavior of dipole - nucleus cross section at the threshold energy ( and , therefore , model dependent ) , whereas the theoretical predictions based on cgc physics at lhc energy are under control .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the star collaboration data for the rapidity distribution can be described by a phenomenological model which captures the basic properties of the quantum evolution in the cgc formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of coherent hadron - hadron interactions , introducing the main formulas and discussing the qcd dynamics at high energies . in particular , we present the saturation models considered in the calculations . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we compare our results with the experimental data from star collaboration at rhic and present our predictions for the @xmath0 production at lhc .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "lets consider the hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath9 ) at ultra relativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other .",
    "the photon emmited from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( two - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) . in what follows",
    "our main focus will be in photon - hadron processes .",
    "considering the requirement that photoproduction is not accompanied by hadronic interaction ( ultra - peripheral collision ) an analytic approximation for the equivalent photon flux of a nuclei can be calculated , which is given by @xcite @xmath10\\ , \\label{fluxint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the photon energy , @xmath12 is the lorentz boost of a single beam and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the modified bessel functions .",

    ", @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the c.m.s energy of the hadron - hadron system .",
    "the coherence condition limits the photon virtuality to very low values , which implies that for most purposes , they can be considered as real . in particular , for @xmath23 collisions at lhc the lorentz factor is @xmath24 , giving the maximum c.m.s . @xmath25",
