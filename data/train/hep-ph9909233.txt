    "the standard model ( sm ) ,  @xcite gives an excellent theoretical description of the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "this theory , which is based on an @xmath0 gauge group , has proven extraordinarily robust . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , all data in the electroweak sector to date appears to be in perfect agreement with the sm predictions , and there are just a few ( quite indirect ) hints for physics beyond the sm .",
    "nevertheless , there are theoretical aspects of the sm which suggest the need for new physics . in addition , there are certain open questions within the sm whose answers can only be found by invoking physics beyond the sm .    in the last year , the observation by the superkamiokande  @xcite collaboration of neutrino oscillations provided the first experimental indication that some new physics exists which causes a large splitting among the leptonic doublets . while in the quark sector @xmath1 , it appears that in the leptonic sector @xmath2 . as we shall see , the most natural explanation for this phenomena is the existence of a new scale far above the electroweak scale .    in these lectures",
    "i will try to explore some of the new physics scenarios which are motivated by theoretical considerations and try to confront and constrain them with what we know experimentally , both from the indirect hints coming from the electroweak sector as well as from the more direct hints coming from neutrino oscillations .",
    "the standard model lagrangian can be written as the sum of four pieces .",
    "schematically , one has @xmath3 the first two terms in the above lagrangian contain the interactions of the fermions in the theory with the gauge fields and the self - interactions of the gauge fields .",
    "the precision electroweak measurements , as well as most qcd tests , essentially have checked these pieces of the sm .",
    "in fact , for the electroweak tests , all that the symmetry - breaking piece , @xmath4 and the yukawa piece , @xmath5 , provide are a * renormalizable cut - off * @xmath6 and a * large * fermion mass @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath4 also allows for the spontaneous generation of mass for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bosons .",
    "the masses of these excitations are given by the formulas @xmath10 which involve the @xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath12 $ ] , coupling constants as well as a mass scale , @xmath13 , arising from @xmath4 .",
    "this scale  the fermi scale  is related to the fermi constant @xmath14 and sets the scale of the electroweak interactions : @xmath15    it is important to note that neither the pure gauge field piece of @xmath16 nor the fermion - gauge piece of this lagrangian contain explicit mass terms .",
    "a mass term for the gauge fields @xmath17 is forbidden explicitly by the local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "masses for the gauge fields [ cf . eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] can arise after the symmetry breakdown @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , fermion mass terms of the form @xmath19 are forbidden by the @xmath20 assignments of the fermions .",
    "this follows since all left - handed fermions are part of @xmath21 doublets , while all right - handed fermions are @xmath21 singlets .",
    "because of these circumstances , mass generation in the standard model is intimately connected to the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak @xmath20 symmetry . as a result , not only are the gauge boson masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 proportional to the fermi scale @xmath13 , but so are the masses for all the fermions as well as the mass of the higgs boson @xmath24 @xmath25 the difference between eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq . ( 6 ) is that , in the latter case , the proportionality constants are * not * known . or , better said , they are related to phenomena we have not yet seen .",
    "there are , however , two important exceptions to the pattern given by eq . ( 6 ) .",
    "first of all , the masses of hadrons are not simply related to the masses of quarks .",
    "thus they depend on another scale besides @xmath13 .",
    "this scale , @xmath26 , is a * dynamical scale * whose magnitude can be inferred from the running of the @xmath27 coupling constant .",
    "a convenient definition is to take @xmath26 to be the scale where @xmath28 becomes of @xmath29 .",
    "group since its coupling becomes strong at scales much below the scale @xmath13 , where the @xmath21 group breaks down .",
    "] then @xmath26 serves to set the mass scale of the light hadrons which receive the bulk of their mass from qcd dynamical effects ..",
    "@xcite ] hadrons containing heavy quarks , on the other hand , get most of their mass from the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "thus , less of their mass depends on qcd dynamics and @xmath26 .    the second exception to eq .",
    "( 6 ) is provided by neutrinos .",
    "it is clear that for any particle carrying electromagnetic charge the only allowed mass term must involve particles and antiparticles , as detailed in eq .",
    "lorentz invariance , however , allows one to write down mass terms involving two particle fields , or two antiparticle fields .",
    "such mass terms , called majorana mass terms , are allowed for neutrinos . in particular , since the right - handed neutrinos have no @xmath20 quantum numbers , one can write down an @xmath20 invariant mass term for these states of the form @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a charge conjugation matrix needed for lorentz invariance.@xcite the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath32 contains mass scales which are totally * independent * from @xmath13 .",
    "we will return to this point later on in these lectures .    ignoring these more detailed questions ,",
    "one of the principal issues which remains open in the standard model is the nature of the fermi scale @xmath13 .",
    "the role of symmetry breakdown as a generator of mass scales is familiar in superconductivity . in that case , the formation of an electron number violating cooper pair @xmath33  @xcite sets up a mass gap between the normal and the superconducting ground states .",
    "the fermi scale @xmath13 plays an analogous role in the electroweak theory .",
    "it is the scale of the order parameter which is responsible for the breakdown of @xmath20 down to @xmath34 .",
    "although the size of @xmath13 @xmath35 is known , its precise origin is yet unclear .",
    "two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of @xmath13 :    \\i ) the fermi scale is associated with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some * elementary scalar * field , or fields @xmath36 .",
    "\\ii ) the fermi scale is connected with the formation of some * dynamical condensates * of fermions of some underlying deeper theory , @xmath37 .    roughly speaking , the above two alternatives correspond to having @xmath4 being described either by a weakly coupled theory or by a strongly coupled theory .",
    "the nature and origin of the fermi scale , of course , is not the only unanswered theoretical question in the sm .",
    "equally mysterious is the physics which gives rise to @xmath5the piece of the sm lagrangian which is responsible for the masses of , and mixing among , the elementary fermions in the theory .",
    "in contrast to @xmath13 , however , here one does not have directly a scale to associate with this lagrangian .",
    "it could well be that the * flavor problem*the origin of the fermion masses and of fermion mixing  is the result of physics operating at scales which are much larger than @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , as we will see , trying to generate @xmath5 itself from physics at a scale of order @xmath13 is fraught with difficulties .",
    "in view of the above , i will concentrate for now on only on the symmetry breaking piece of the sm lagrangian . in this context",
    ", it proves useful to begin by examining the simplest example of @xmath4 in which this lagrangian involves just one complex doublet higgs field : @xmath38 : is precisely given by this simplest option . ]",
    "@xmath39 ^ 2~.\\ ] ] in the above @xmath40 is an , arbitrary , coupling constant which , however , must be positive to guarantee a positive definite hamiltonian .",
    "the fermi scale @xmath13 enters directly as a scale parameter in the higgs potential @xmath41 ^ 2~.\\ ] ] the sign in front of the @xmath42 term is chosen appropriately to guarantee that @xmath43 will be asymmetric , with a minimum at a non - zero value for @xmath44 .",
    "this fact is what triggers the breakdown of @xmath20 to @xmath34 , since it forces the field @xmath45 to develop a non - zero vev . as the surviving @xmath46 in the breakdown .",
    "so the choice @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is automatic . ]",
    "@xmath49    because @xmath13 is an internal scale in the potential @xmath43 , in isolation , it clearly makes no sense to ask what physics fixes the scale of @xmath13 to be any given particular number .",
    "this question , however , can be asked if one considers the sm in a larger context . for instance",
    ", one can imagine that the sm is an effective theory valid up to some very high cut - off scale @xmath50 , where new physics comes in .",
    "an obvious candidate for @xmath50 is the planck scale @xmath51 , the scale associated with gravity , embodied in newton s constant @xmath52 . in this broader context",
    "then it makes sense to ask what is the relation of @xmath13 to the cut - off @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , because the @xmath53 theory is trivial ,  @xcite with the only consistent theory being one where @xmath54 , considering the scalar interactions in @xmath4 without some high energy cut - off is not sensible .",
    "let me explain .",
    "one can readily compute the evolution of the coupling constant @xmath40 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "one finds that @xmath56 evolves in an * opposite * way to the way in which the qcd coupling constant @xmath57 evolves , growing as @xmath55 gets larger .",
    "this can be seen immediately from the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for @xmath40 @xmath58 this equation , in contrast to the qcd case , has a positive rather than a negative sign in front of its first term . as a result ,",
    "if one solves the above rge , including only this first term , one finds a singularity at large @xmath55 which is a reflection of this growth @xmath59 this singularity is known as the landau pole , since landau was the first to notice this anomalous kind of behavior.@xcite    one can not really trust the location of the landau pole derived from eq .",
    "( 12 ) @xmath60~,\\ ] ] since eq .",
    "( 12 ) stops being valid when @xmath40 gets too large .",
    "when this happens , of course , one should not have neglected the higher order terms in eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "nevertheless , once the cut - off @xmath61 is fixed , one can predict @xmath56 for scales @xmath55 sufficiently below the cut - off . indeed , the @xmath53 theory is perfectly sensible as long as one restricts oneself to @xmath62 .",
    "if one wants to push the cut - off to infinity , however , one sees from ( 13 ) that @xmath63 .",
    "this is the statement of triviality ,  @xcite within this simplified context .    in the case of the sm",
    ", one can  measure \" where the cut - off @xmath61 is in @xmath4 from the value of the higgs mass . using the potential ( 9 )",
    "one finds that @xmath64 obviously , as long as the higgs mass is light with respect to @xmath13 the coupling @xmath40 is small and the cut - off is far away . indeed , using eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) one finds that even if @xmath65 , then the cut - off is very large still , of order of the planck mass @xmath66 !",
    "so , as long as @xmath6 is that light , or lighter , the effective theory described by @xmath4 is very reliable , and * weakly coupled * , with @xmath67 . in these circumstances",
    "it is meaningful to ask the question whether the large hierarchy @xmath68 is a stable condition .",
    "this question , following t hooft ,  @xcite is often called the problem of * naturalness*.    if , on the other hand , the higgs mass is heavy , of order of the cut - off @xmath69 , then it is pretty clear that @xmath4 as an effective theory stops making sense .",
    "the coupling @xmath40 is so strong that one can not separate the particle - like excitations from the cut - off itself .",
    "numerical investigations on the lattice  @xcite have indicated that this occurs when @xmath70 in this case , it is clear that @xmath71 , as the order parameter of the symmetry breakdown , must be replaced by something else .    before discussing this latter point ,",
    "let me first return to the light higgs case . here",
    "one must worry about the naturalness of having the fermi scale @xmath13 be so much smaller that the planck mass @xmath72 , which is clearly a physical cut - off .",
    "it turns out , in general , that the hierarchy @xmath73 is * not * stable .",
    "this is easy to see since radiative effects in a theory with a cut - off destabilize any pre - existing hierarchy .",
    "indeed , this was t hooft s original argument.@xcite quantities that are * not protected * by symmetries suffer quadratic mass shifts .",
    "this is the case for the higgs mass .",
    "this mass , schematically , shifts from the value given in eq .",
    "( 14 ) to @xmath74 it follows from eq .",
    "( 17 ) that if @xmath75 , the higgs bosons can not remain light . or , saying it another way , if one wants the higgs to remain light , one needs an enormous amount of fine tuning of parameters to guarantee that , in the end , it remains a light excitation .",
    "this kind of fine - tuning is really unacceptable , so one is invited to look for some protective symmetry to guarantee that the hierarchy @xmath76 is stable . does not explain why one has such a hierarchy to begin with .",
    "this is a much harder question to answer . ]",
    "such a protective symmetry exists  it is supersymmetry ( susy).@xcite susy is a boson - fermion symmetry in which bosonic degrees of freedom are paired with fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "if supersymmetry is exact then the masses of the fermions and of their bosonic partners are the same . in a supersymmetric version of the standard model",
    "all quadratic divergences cancel .",
    "thus parameters like the higgs boson mass will not be sensitive to a high energy cut - off . roughly speaking , via supersymmetry , the higgs boson mass is kept light naturally since its fermionic partner has a mass which is protected by a chiral symmetry and is of @xmath77 .    because one has not seen any of the susy partners of the states in the sm yet , it is clear that if a supersymmetric extension of the sm exists then the associated supersymmetry must be broken",
    ". remarkably , even if susy is broken the naturalness problem in the sm is resolved , provided that the splitting between the fermion - boson susy partners is itself of @xmath77 .",
    "for example , the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass due to a @xmath8-loop is moderated into only a logarithmic divergence by the presence of a loop of winos , the spin-1/2 susy partners of the @xmath8 bosons .",
    "schematically , in the susy case , eq . ( 17 ) gets replaced by @xmath78 so , as long as the masses of the susy partners ( denoted by a tilde ) are themselves not split away by much more than @xmath13 , radiative corrections will not destabilize the hierarchy @xmath79 .",
    "let me recapitulate .",
    "theoretical considerations regarding the nature of the fermi scale have brought us to consider two alternatives for new physics associated with the @xmath18 breakdown and @xmath4 :    \\i ) @xmath4 is the lagrangian of some elementary scalar fields interacting together via an asymmetric potential , whose minimum is set by the fermi scale @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of non - vanishing vevs triggers the electroweak breakdown . however , to guarantee the naturalness of the hierarchy @xmath76 , both @xmath4 and the whole standard model lagrangian must be augmented by other fields and interactions so as to enable the theory ( at least approximately ) to be supersymmetric .",
    "obviously , if this alternative is true , there is plenty of new physics to be discovered , since all particles have superpartners of mass @xmath80 .",
    "\\ii ) the symmetry breaking sector of the sm has itself a dynamical cut - off of @xmath77 . in this case",
    ", it makes no sense to describe @xmath4 in terms of strongly coupled scalar fields .",
    "rather , @xmath4 describes a dynamical theory of some new strongly interacting fermions @xmath81 , whose condensates cause the @xmath18 breakdown .",
    "the strong interactions which form the condensates @xmath82 also identify the fermi scale as the dynamical scale of the underlying theory , very much analogous to @xmath26 . if this alternative turns out to be true , then one expects in the future to see lots of new physics , connected with these new strong interactions , when one probes them at energies of @xmath77 .    in the past year , a third very speculative alternative has been suggested besides the two possibilities above.@xcite this alternative is based on the idea that , perhaps , in nature there could exist some extra  largish \" compact dimensions of size r.  @xcite in such theories , the fundamental scale of gravity in @xmath83-dimensions could well be quite different than the planck scale",
    ". in particular , it may well be that @xmath84_{d+4 } \\sim v_f~.\\ ] ] that is , at short distances @xmath85 the scale of gravity could well be different than the planck scale , the usual scale of 4-dimensional gravity valid at large distances @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , this short - distance scale could be identical to the fermi scale .",
    "the relationship between these two gravity scales depends both on @xmath87 and on the number of extra dimensions @xmath88 :  @xcite @xmath89_{d+4})^{\\frac{d+2}{2 } } r^{\\frac{d}{2 } } \\sim v_f[v_fr]^{\\frac{d}{2}}\\ ] ] where the second ( approximate ) equality holds if eq .",
    "( 19 ) holds .    obviously , if eq .",
    "( 19 ) were to be true , then there is no naturalness issue  the fermi scale is the scale of gravity in the  true \" extra - dimensional theory ! from eq .",
    "( 20 ) it follows that , if @xmath90 , then the scale of the compact dimensions needed is quite large @xmath91 ! on the other hand , if @xmath92 , as string theory suggests , then @xmath93 .",
    "these distances are small enough that perhaps one would not have noticed the modifications implied for the gravitational potential at distances @xmath94 .",
    "although these theories do not suffer from any naturalness problem , and thus are perfectly consistent with a single weakly - coupled higgs field , they do predict the existence of other phenomena beyond the sm .",
    "in particular , if this alternative is correct , one would expect copious production of gravitons at energies of order @xmath95 , as one begins to excite the compact dimensions .",
    "thus , also here there is spectacular new physics to find !    in these lectures , i will try to illustrate some of the consequences of all the three alternatives for @xmath13 alluded to above .",
    "in addition , to try to divine which of the above ideas is most likely to be correct , i want to explore in some depth some of the points which come from experiment suggesting possible traces of physics beyond the standard model . in the next section , i will try to describe in more detail what these hints of physics beyond the standard model are and what is their likely origin .",
    "there are four different experimental inputs which help shed some light on possible physics beyond the standard model .",
    "i will discuss them in turn .",
    "one of the strongest constraints on physics beyond the sm is that the sm gives an excellent fit to the data , as we already illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in practice , since all fermions but the top are quite light compared to the scale of the @xmath8 and @xmath9-bosons , all quantities in the sm are specified as functions of 5 parameters : @xmath96 ; @xmath97 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath6 ; and @xmath7 .",
    "it proves convenient to trade the first three of these for another triplet of quantities in the sm which are better measured : @xmath98 ; @xmath23 ; and @xmath14 .",
    "this trade - off has become the common practice in the field .",
    "once one has adopted a set of * standard parameters * then all physical measurable quantities can be expressed as a function of this  standard set \" . for example , the @xmath8-mass in the sm is given as a function of these parameters as : @xmath99    because @xmath98 , @xmath23 , and @xmath14 , as well as @xmath7 to better than 3% : @xmath100 gev.@xcite ] are rather accurately known , all sm fits essentially serve to constrain only * one * unknown  the higgs mass @xmath6 .",
    "this constraint , however , is not particularly strong because all radiative effects depends on @xmath6 only logarithmically .",
    "that is , radiative corrections give contributions of @xmath101 .",
    "the result of the sm fit of all precision data gives for the higgs mass the result :  @xcite @xmath102 or @xmath103 these results for the higgs mass are compatible with limits on @xmath6 coming from direct searches for the higgs boson in the process @xmath104 at lep 200 .",
    "the limit presented at the 1998 ichep in vancouver was  @xcite    @xmath105    however , preliminary results presented at the 1999 winter conferences have raised this bound to the neighborhood of 95 gev .",
    "it is particularly gratifying that the sm fits indicate the need for a light higgs boson , since this  solution \" is what is internally consistent .",
    "let me illustrate how this emerges , for example , from studies of the @xmath9-leptonic vertex .",
    "the axial coupling of the @xmath9 @xmath106e\\ ] ] gets modified by radiative corrections to @xmath107~.\\ ] ] the shift in the @xmath108-parameter , @xmath109 , gets its principal contribution from @xmath7 .",
    "however , it has also a ( weak ) dependence on @xmath6.@xcite @xmath110 the sm fit gives  @xcite @xmath111 with the higgs contribution giving , for @xmath112 gev , @xmath113 . obviously ,",
    "if @xmath6 were to be very large , the higgs contribution could have even changed the sign of @xmath109 .",
    "the value emerging from the sm fit instead is perfectly compatible with having a rather light higgs mass .",
    "in fact , one nice way to summarize the result of the sm fit is that , approximately , this fit constrains @xmath114 that is , there are * no * large logarithms associated with the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "i should remark that a good sm fit does not necessarily exclude possible extensions of the sm involving either new particles or new interactions , provided that these new particles and/or interactions give only small effects .",
    "typically , the effects of new physics are small if the excitations associated with this new physics have mass scales several times the @xmath8-mass",
    ".    one can quantify the above discussion in a more precise way by introducing a general parametrization for the vacuum polarization tensors of the gauge bosons and the @xmath115 vertex .",
    "these are the places where the dominant electroweak radiative corrections occur and therefore are the quantities which are probably the most sensitive new physics.@xcite i do not want to enter into a full discussion of this procedure here since it is already well explained in the literature.@xcite however , i want to talk about one example , connected to modifications of the gauge fields vacuum polarization tensors , because precision electroweak data serves to provide a strong constraint on dynamical symmetry breaking theories - excluding theories which are qcd - like",
    ".    there are four distinct vacuum polarization contributions @xmath116 , where the pairs @xmath117 . for sufficiently low values of the momentum transfer",
    "@xmath118 it obviously suffices to expand @xmath116 only up to @xmath119 .",
    "thus , approximately , one needs to consider 8 different parameters associated with these contributions : @xmath120 with the remaining corrections being terms of @xmath121 with @xmath50 being the scale of the new physics .",
    "in fact , there are not really 8 independent parameters since electromagnetic gauge invariance requires that @xmath122 of the 6 remaining parameters one can fix 3 combinations of coefficients in terms of @xmath123 and @xmath23 .",
    "hence , in a most general analysis , the gauge field vacuum polarization tensors ( for @xmath124 ) only involve 3 arbitrary parameters .",
    "the usual choice,@xcite is to have one of these contain the main quadratic @xmath7-dependence , leaving the other two essentially independent of @xmath7 .",

    "these authors have looked for the processes @xmath496 and @xmath497 , with the graviton experimentally being manifested as missing energy .",
    "analyses of the lep data for the process @xmath498 and of the cdf / do bounds for monojet production yield the bounds : @xmath499    obviously the lhc will be sensitive to much greater values of @xmath245 .",
    "however , at least for @xmath90 , astrophysics already puts a strong constraint on @xmath245 .",
    "basically , if @xmath245 is too low graviton emission will cool off supernovas too quickly .",
    "the fact that sn 1987a does not show any anomalous cooling then allows one to set a bound of @xmath500 tev , for @xmath90 .",
    "in these lectures i have discussed the theoretical arguments for believing that there is physics beyond the electroweak theory , related to the origin and magnitude of the fermi scale @xmath13 . each of the suggestions for new physics which i examined : dynamical symmetry breaking , supersymmetry and extra compact dimensions , had its own characteristic signals and its own set of theoretical puzzles to resolve . _ a priori _ , it is clearly not possible to select among these alternatives purely theoretically . however , from the few meager experimental hints for physics beyond the sm that we have today , supersymmetry does appear to be favored .",
    "what is exciting is that we should know quite soon which of these alternatives , if any , are correct . if one is lucky , the answer may come perhaps already from experiments at lep200 or the tevatron .",
    "however , the origin of the fermi scale should certainly become clear once the lhc starts running .",
