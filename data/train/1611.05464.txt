    "graphene - like two dimensional structures have captured the imagination of experimentalists for practical applications , because of the high hole / electron densities ( @xmath3 much larger than gaas electron gas ) achieved by gating@xcite at a small fraction of the cost and complexity of producing a two dimensional electron gas with well known semi - conductor technologies .",
    "one can also build semi - conductors from graphene by breaking the sublattice a / b symmetry , in systems such as boron - nitride@xcite , generating a gap ( @xmath4 ev ) at the k point with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "because it is undesiderable to introduce substitutional impurities to modify graphene s properties , due to the rapid degradation of electron mobilities , one can resort to proximity effects@xcite in order for graphene to inherit potentially useful couplings and properties such as a strong spin - orbit coupling@xcite , magnetism@xcite and even chirality@xcite . deposited transition metals such as co and ni have matching lattice constants and a few layers easily form on graphene with a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy@xcite .",
    "such magnetic layers can be used to introduce new effective couplings between graphene @xmath5 orbitals , thus inducing a strong rashba type coupling , inherited from the co / ni overlayer , and also an electron spin polarization with perturbative modifications of the electron mobility .    in this article",
    "we consider tight - binding modelling of co / ni on planar graphene in two configurations .",
    "as found by dft calculations@xcite , the lowest energy configuration corresponds to one sub - lattice site of the graphene atop a co / ni atom while the neighbouring sub - lattice atom is in a co / ni hcp site . for this configuration , ref .",
    "has shown that the graphene inherits an antiferromagnetic order due mostly to the sublattice asymmetry of the coupling between @xmath5 orbitals of carbon and the co. this type of order lends itself to enhanced rkky interactions between co islands on graphene@xcite , that can be tuned to be either ferro or anti - ferro by gate control .    the second configuration we consider corresponds to a global lattice shift from the previous one where all graphene carbon sites fall at hcp sites of the co / ni layer . referring to the detailed dft study of ref .",
    "we will first derive the tight - binding model for the first configuration by describing the orbital overlaps and chemical potentials .",
    "we then use such parameterization to estimate the corresponding ones from the second configuration . while the first configuration yields anti",
    "- ferro order on graphene , the second configuration is symmetric between a / b sublattices and yields ferromagnetic order in the graphene plane .",
    "the summary of this paper is as follows : in section ii we describe the two different registers we consider for the tight binding model .",
    "focusing first on the atop configuration we identify the most salient overlaps involved between the carbon @xmath5 orbitals and the @xmath6 orbitals of co / ni ( considering only nearest neighbour overlaps ) , and derive using the band folding scheme , the effective hamiltonian for @xmath7electrons of graphene in the presence of the magnetic overlayer .",
    "next , we shift the lattice register and consider the hcp configuration , where now the configuration is such that non - diagonal pseudo - spin terms arise , coupling a and b sublattices . in section iii we obtain the bloch hamiltonians for both configurations and determine the band structure and wavefunctions for the bulk samples .",
    "the new hcp configuration displays a non - trivial ferromagnetic ordering and a spin dependent kinetic term proportional to the spin - splitting energy of the co / ni covering .",

    "using this state , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 so every band has a full spin polarization in either of the two spin orientations as depicted in right - hand panel of fig.[bandstructures ] .",
    "the coupling of the spin and kinetic energy ( see last term in eq.[heff22basis ] ) induces a striking behavior which mimicks a spin - orbit coupling induced by the bias current and the magnetism of the co. in the sense of equilibrium / persistent currents@xcite , at @xmath171 all bands have occupation below the fermi energy , thus the spin polarization is zero at both k points . as @xmath172 increases e.g. in the positive direction , ( see fig .",
    "[ bandstructures ] upper - right panel ) one of the bands emerges above the fermi level and we have a net polarization which is up spin .",
    "a range of @xmath172 values preserves this polarization until a second band emerges from the fermi sea , then the polarization returns to zero .",
    "the same behavior occurs in the opposite @xmath172 direction .",

    "note that this term is not derived from the atomic soi ( as is the case for both the intrinsic and rashba interactions ) but is purely parameterized by the spin - splitting energy of the co and the wave - vector deviation from the k point .",
    "as can be seen from eqs.[identconf1 ] and [ identconf2 ] , if the spin - splitting energy @xmath173 vanishes , this term does not appear .",
    "following the lowest energy occupied states , the system is ferromagnetic in the vicinity of @xmath174 . at the k point",
    "we have degenerate bands with the same spin orientation as the co layer , nevertheless , driving a current by means of an external electric field in the graphene plane , one can tune the @xmath172 vector so that two oppositely oriented bands are the lowest occupied bands , making the magnetization ground state zero .",
    "so we have magnetic state switching controlled by the charge current on the graphene layer .",
    "various scenarios of interest can be explored by using , as proposed in ref . , a cu surface so as to sandwich the graphene layer between co and cu .",
    "the cu surface will serve to control the fermi level and access differently polarized magnetization states as a function of gate voltage and charge current .",
    "we have derived , within the perturbative tight - binding approximation , the spectral signatures of two co - graphene registries , the atop ( one co atom atop of each a carbon atom ) configuration and the hcp ( co at the centers of the hexagonal cells of graphene ) . each registry produces a very different spectrum : a ) the atop configuration generates a gap in pristine graphene with spin dependent electron heavy and light effective masses for both the conduction and valence bands that are tunable controlling orbital overlaps . as found by dft , the graphene layer becomes almost perfectly antiferromagnetic with down spin orientations at sublattice a and up spin favoured orientation at sublattice b. b ) the hcp configuration preserves the linear dispersion of graphene , with a small modification of the fermion velocities . the resulting linear dispersions shift in energy according to the spin orientation favoured on the sublattices . for this configuration ,",
    "ferromagnetic order is preferred and it is parallel to the co polarization .",
    "we have suggested ways to manipulate the magnetic state of the surface by applying a gate voltage ( in the work function regime ) and by driving a current through the system .",
    "there is peculiar coupling between spin and electron momentum induced by the magnetic state of the co. it amounts to a spin - orbit coupling induced by the driving current .",
    "this feature is worth while exploring in the future for both its transport and topological implications in graphene nanoribbons .",
    "using co and ni interchangeably in this work is a good approximation as can be judged from detailed dft calculations@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are some quantitative differences in the amount of charge transfer and the magnetic moment on the graphene mainly induced by slight changes in the bonding lengths both in the graphene and the interface layer involved . for the atop configuration",
    "the charge transfers per carbon atom are almost identical between co and ni , but the induced magnetization can be two times higher for ni for small number of layers of the metal .",
    "also the gap induced in the atop configuration can be manipulated slightly by changing the number of layers without changing the qualitative picture .",

    "<S> we build a tight - binding hamiltonian describing co / ni over graphene , contemplating atop ( a co / ni atom on top of each carbon atom of one graphene sublattice ) and hcp ( one co / ni atom per graphene plaquette ) configurations . for the atop configuration </S>",
    "<S> the orbitals involved , for the co / ni , are the @xmath0 which most strongly couples to one graphene sublattice and the @xmath1 , @xmath2 orbitals that couple directly to the second sublattice site . </S>",
    "<S> such configuration is diagonal in pseudo - spin and spin space , yielding electron doping of the graphene and antiferro - magnetic ordering in the primitive cell in agreement with dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the second , hcp configuration is symmetric in the graphene sublattices and only involves coupling to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the register of the lattices in this case allows for a new coupling between nearest neighbour sites , generating non - diagonal terms in the pseudo - spin space and novel spin - kinetic couplings mimicking a spin - orbit coupling generated by a magnetic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting proximity effect in this case yields ferromagnetic order in the graphene substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the band structure in the vicinity of the k points for both configurations , the bloch wavefunctions and their spin polarization . </S>"
