    "the initial state radiation method @xcite is a very effective method to demonstrate the cross section shape and to tag the most interesting phenomena , but the precision of this method is not known and some theoretical and experimental limits can be foreseen . * the previous experience shows us that experiments for the hadron production , @xmath61-production , and @xmath48 production can not substitute precise @xmath0 experiments for the vector meson spectroscopy .",
    "* the knowledge of the vector meson spectroscopy is incomplete . *",
    "the heavy quarkonium spectra are known much better than the spectrum of the light vector mesons . *",
    "it is required to measure a complete set of hadron production cross sections in the energy region @xmath56 with the integrated luminosity about @xmath62 .",
    "* this luminosity investment will provide an opportunity to study as traditional and exotic states , hadronic and radiative transitions .",
    "* the two new @xmath0 projects vepp-2000 @xcite at novosibirsk and pep - n at slac are intend to bring a light on the light vector meson spectroscopy .",
    "this two projects are complimentary in many aspects , so the realisation of both is very well required .",
