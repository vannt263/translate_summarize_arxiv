    "the study of the effect of the clouds and aerosol layers on the cumulative vertical profile of cherenkov light is limited to the case of a geometrically thin cloud with moderate optical depth , @xmath58 .",

    "for every eas , the number of photons in each bunch of cherenkov photons originating from the altitude @xmath59 is reduced by @xmath36 at the ground level .",
    "second effect of the cloud on the cherenkov signal is the enhancement of the flux from the cloud itself , due to the scattering of the photons in the cloud .",
    "we take this effect into account in the following way . for each bunch of @xmath60 photons originating from above the cloud ,",
    "we generate a new bunch originating from the altitude @xmath45 and containing @xmath61 photons .",
    "the direction of the new bunch differs from the direction of the original bunch by the scattering angle @xmath62 , which is a random number drawn from a distribution determined by the scattering phase function . in our model example",

    "the strength of the enhancement of the signal from the cloud altitude strongly depends on the details of the shape of the scattering phase function @xmath67 , and on the distance of the shower footprint from the telescope position .    in our model calculations",
    "we make a simplifying assumption that photon propagation in the cloud is dominated by single scattering events .",
    "this is , in general , not true for very optically thick clouds @xmath68 , in which multiple scattering becomes more and more important with the increase of the optical depth .",
    "multiple scattering effects also affect the strength of the `` cloud peak '' feature visible in fig . [",

    "[ fig : cloudy_sky ] shows a numerically calculated stacked vertical profile of cherenkov light from the a set of nearly vertical eas detected in one second exposure by a large reflector telescope ( dish size @xmath46  m ) with a fov @xmath47 in clear and cloudy sky conditions .",

    "[ fig : cloudy_sky ] shows the minimal detectable optical depth of a cloud as a function of the cloud altitude .",
    "it is determined by the condition that this distortion of the vertical profile of cherenkov light above and below the cloud should be stronger than random fluctuations of the clear sky profile .",
    "measurement of the optical depth is done via comparison of the overall normalisations of the vertical profiles above and below the cloud .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement of both normalisations is determined by the statistics of the signal from above and below the cloud , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the error of the measurement of both normalisations is @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the error of the measurement of the ratio of normalisations is @xmath91 .",

    "2 shows the minimal detectable optical depth of the cloud , derived from the condition @xmath92 .",
    "the minimal detectable optical depth is shown as a function of the altitude of the cloud for different telescope configurations .",
    "we have taken the telescopes with parameters close to those of existing and planned iact facilities , such as hess ( telescopes with 12  m dishes and @xmath93 fov ) , magic ( 17  m telescopes with @xmath94 fov ) and the telescopes of the small - size telescopes ( sst ) sub - array of the planned cta facility ( 4  m dishes , @xmath95 fov ) .",
    "longer exposure time should allow detection of the clouds with lower optical depth and also characterisation of clouds with a more complicated vertical structure ( compared to a single layer geometrically thin cloud considered in our model example ) .",
    "the improvement of the minimal measurable @xmath35 with exposure time would , however , stop as soon as the level of variations of the vertical profile induced by the presence of the cloud will become comparable to the level of the systematic uncertainties of the knowledge of the instrument characteristics and their time variability .",
    "the scattered light signal is responsible for the enhancement of emission from the altitude of the cloud , visible in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cloudy_sky ] .",
    "measurement of the strength of the scattered light peak as a function of the distance @xmath39 provides a probe of the scattering amplitude as a function of @xmath62 or , in other words , of the scattering phase function of the cloud particles .    the spectrum of cherenkov emission",
    "@xmath96 ^ 2v^2)\\right)$ ] ( @xmath97 is the refraction index of the air , @xmath98 is particle velocity ) @xcite is a continuum stretching through uv and visible bands .",
    "cherenkov light provides a `` white light '' source in the atmosphere .",
    "the use of such white light for remote sensing has certain advantages compared to typically mono - wavelength light used in lidars @xcite .",
    "namely , the broad range of the cherenkov light opens a possibility for a measurement of the optical depth as a function of wavelength .",
    "this provides a tool for the measurement of sizes of aerosol particles @xmath99 , since the scattering / extinction cross - section @xmath100 depends on the size parameter @xmath101 .",
    "modifications of existing iacts are needed for such a study , because currently existing systems measure only the intensity of cherenkov light integrated over a single spectral window of light sensors .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a novel approach for the remote sounding of the atmosphere using the uv cherenkov light generated by the cosmic ray induced eas throughout the atmospheric volume .",
    "this approach allows detection of atmospheric features , such as cloud and aerosol layers , and characterisation of their geometrical and optical properties .",
    "noticing an analogy between the uv light pulse produced by the eas and the pulse of the laser light , commonly used in the lidar devices , we demonstrated that the principles of the measurement of the properties of clouds and aerosols based on the imaging and timing of the eas signal are very similar to those used by the lidar .",
    "in fact , the equations ( [ eq : shower_eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq : shower_eq2 ] ) are the direct analogs of the well - known `` lidar equation '' commonly used in the analysis and interpretation of the lidar data .",
    "there are , however , important differences between the eas and laser light pulses , which make the new approach based on the eas light complementary to the lidar approach .",
    "most importantly , the cherenkov light is continuously `` regenerated '' all along the eas track from the top to the bottom of the atmosphere , while the laser light is generated once in a single location ( e.g. at the ground level for the ground based lidar ) .",
    "another important difference is that the cherenkov light has a continuum spectrum spanning through the visible and uv bands , while the laser light of the lidars is mono - wavelength .",
    "we have shown that the difference in the properties of the light used by the lidars and by the proposed eas + cherenkov telescope setup potentially provides new possibilities for the measurement of physical characteristics of the cloud / aerosol particles , such as e.g. size distribution and the scattering phase function .",
    "thus , the proposed technique is expected to provide data useful in the context of atmospheric physics .",
    "existing iact systems use a range of atmospheric monitoring tools to characterise weather conditions at their observation sites , including infrared / visible cameras and conventional lidars .",
    "the atmospheric monitoring data are collected with the aim to control the quality of the astronomical gamma - ray data , which are the data on the uv cherenkov emission from the eas induced by gamma - rays coming from high - energy astronomical sources .",
    "we have demonstrated that the iacts themselves could serve as powerful atmospheric monitoring tools , providing the atmospheric data complementary to those of the lidars and visible / infrared cameras .",
    "the atmospheric sounding data could be partially extracted from the background cosmic ray data of  observations by existing iacts .",
    "their collection does not require interruptions of the planned astronomical observation schedule .",
    "moreover , the atmospheric data could be collected in cloudy sky conditions when astronomical observations are difficult or impossible .",
    "availability of detailed simultaneous atmospheric sounding data should allow a better control of the quality of the astronomical  data taken by existing iacts , e.g. via a better definition of the `` clear sky '' conditions .",
    "besides , this should also open a possibility for observations in a borderline situation of the presence of moderately optically thin clouds and aerosols .",
