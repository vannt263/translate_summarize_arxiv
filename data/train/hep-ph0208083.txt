    "since penguin topologies enter in @xmath7 essentially with the same weak phase as tree - diagram - like contributions , i.e.  the phase difference is doubly cabibbo - suppressed , we obtain to a very good approximation @xcite : @xmath69 where the cp - violating weak @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 in the standard model .",
    "after important first steps by the opal , cdf and aleph collaborations , the @xmath7 mode ( and similar decays ) led eventually to the observation of cp violation in the @xmath0 system in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the present status of @xmath70 is given as follows : @xmath71 yielding the average of @xmath72 which agrees very well with the results of the ckm fits ( see ( [ ut - fit - ranges ] ) ) , @xmath73 .",
    "in the lhc era , the experimental accuracy of the measurement of @xmath70 may be increased by one order of magnitude @xcite . in view of such a tremendous accuracy",
    ", it will then be important to obtain deeper insights into the theoretical uncertainties affecting ( [ bpsik - cp ] ) , which are due to penguin contributions . a possibility to control them is provided by the @xmath74 channel @xcite .",
    "moreover , also direct cp violation in @xmath75 modes allows us to probe such penguin effects @xcite .",
    "so far , there are no experimental indications for non - vanishing cp asymmetries of this kind .",
    "although the agreement between ( [ s2b - average ] ) and the results of the ckm fits is striking , it should not be forgotten that new physics may nevertheless hide in @xmath76 .",
    "the point is that the key quantity is actually @xmath5 , which is fixed through @xmath77 up to a twofold ambiguity , @xmath78 here the former solution would be in perfect agreement with the range implied by the ckm fits , @xmath79 , whereas the latter would correspond to new physics .",
    "the two solutions can be distinguished through a measurement of the sign of @xmath80 : in the case of @xmath81 , we would conclude @xmath82 , whereas @xmath83 would point towards @xmath84 , i.e.  new physics .",
    "there are several strategies on the market to resolve the twofold ambiguity in the extraction of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they are rather challenging from a practical point of view . in the @xmath75 system",
    ", @xmath80 can be extracted from the time - dependent angular distribution of the decay products of @xmath85 k^\\ast[\\to\\pi^0k_{\\rm s}]$ ] , if the sign of a hadronic parameter @xmath86 involving a strong phase @xmath63 is fixed through factorization  @xcite .",
    "let us note that analyses of this kind are already in progress at the @xmath0 factories @xcite .",
    "the preferred mechanism for new physics to manifest itself in cp - violating effects in @xmath7 is through @xmath3@xmath4 mixing , which arises in the standard model from the well - known box diagrams .",
    "however , new physics may also enter at the @xmath75 amplitude level . employing estimates borrowed from effective field theory",
    "suggests that the effects are at most of @xmath87 for a generic new - physics scale @xmath88 in the tev regime . in order to obtain the whole picture , a set of appropriate observables can be introduced , using @xmath7 and its charged counterpart @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "so far , these observables do not yet indicate any deviation from the standard model .    in the context of new - physics effects in the @xmath75 system , it is interesting to note that an upper bound on @xmath5 is implied by an upper bound on @xmath90 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut - det ] . to be specific ,",
    "we have @xmath91 yielding @xmath92 for @xmath93 . as the determination of @xmath94 from semi - leptonic tree - level decays is very robust concerning the impact of new physics , @xmath95 would require new - physics contributions to @xmath3@xmath4 mixing .",
    "as we will see in the subsequent section , an interesting connection between the two solutions for @xmath5 and constraints on @xmath2 is provided by cp violation in @xmath8 @xcite .    concerning the search for new physics",
    ", many other promising strategies can now be performed in practice at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "an important example is the decay @xmath96 , where  within the standard model  mixing - induced cp violation is to a good accuracy equal to the one in @xmath7 @xcite , and direct cp violation is expected to be small . in analogy to the @xmath75 system @xcite , also here @xmath97 decays should be considered as well in order to obtain the whole picture @xcite .",
    "let us note that the @xmath0 factories have already observed these modes , and that first measurements of @xmath98 were reported very recently by babar and belle @xcite . in the future ,",
    "the experimental situation will improve dramatically .    at this conference ,",
    "a much more detailed discussion of @xmath0 physics beyond the standard model was given by david london @xcite .",
    "let us now focus on the decay @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7 , the relevant penguin parameter is not doubly cabibbo suppressed in the @xmath8 decay amplitude , leading to the well - known `` penguin problem '' in @xmath8 .",
    "if we had negligible penguin contributions , the corresponding cp - violating observables were given as follows @xcite : @xmath99 where we have also used the unitarity relation @xmath100 .",
    "we observe that actually the phases @xmath101 and @xmath2 enter directly in the @xmath8 observables , and not @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , since @xmath5 can be fixed straightforwardly through @xmath7 , we may use @xmath8 to probe @xmath2 .",
    "this is advantageous to deal with penguins and possible new - physics effects , as we will see below .",
    "measurements of the cp - violating @xmath8 observables are already available : @xmath103 @xmath104 unfortunately , the babar and belle results are not fully consistent with each other .",
    "this discrepancy will hopefully be resolved soon .",
    "forming nevertheless the nave averages of the numbers in ( [ adir - exp ] ) and ( [ amix - exp ] ) yields @xmath105 direct cp violation at this level would require large penguin contributions with large cp - conserving strong phases .",
    "a significant impact of penguins on @xmath8 is also indicated by data on @xmath106 decays , as well as by theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is already evident that the penguin contributions to @xmath8 _ can not _ be neglected .",
    "there are many approaches to deal with the penguin problem in the extraction of weak phases from cp violation in @xmath8 ; the best known is an isospin analysis of the @xmath107 system @xcite , yielding @xmath102 .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is very difficult in practice , as it requires a measurement of the @xmath108 branching ratio .",
    "however , useful bounds may already be obtained from experimental constraints on this branching ratio @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we may employ the ckm unitarity to express @xmath109 in terms of @xmath102 and hadronic parameters .",
    "using @xmath110 , a strong phase can be eliminated , allowing us to determine @xmath102 as a function of a hadronic parameter @xmath111 , which is , however , problematic to be determined reliably @xcite .",
    "a different parametrization of @xmath8 , involving a parameter @xmath112 and @xmath113 , is employed in @xcite , where , moreover , @xmath114 is used to eliminate @xmath2 , and @xmath115 is fixed through the standard - model solution @xmath116 implied by @xmath117 .",
    "provided @xmath118 is known , @xmath102 can be extracted from the cp - violating @xmath8 observables . to this end , @xmath26 flavour - symmetry arguments and plausible dynamical assumptions are used to fix @xmath119 through the cp - averaged @xmath13 branching ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath120 is estimated with the help of factorization and data on @xmath121 .",
    "refinements of this approach were presented in @xcite .",
    "another strategy to deal with penguins in @xmath8 is offered by @xmath9 .",
    "using the @xmath59-spin symmetry of strong interactions , @xmath5 and @xmath2 can be extracted from the corresponding cp - violating observables @xcite . in the following discussion",
    ", we shall put a particular emphasis on a variant for the @xmath10 @xmath0-factories , where @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we may then already use the @xmath0-factory data to explore allowed regions in observable space and to extract weak phases and hadronic parameters @xcite .      as can be seen from the corresponding feynman diagrams , @xmath9",
    "is related to @xmath8 through an interchange of all down and strange quarks .",
    "the decay amplitudes read as follows @xcite : @xmath122\\ ] ] @xmath123,\\ ] ] where the cp - conserving strong amplitudes @xmath124 and @xmath125 measure , sloppily speaking , ratios of penguin to tree amplitudes in @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . using these general parametrizations ,",
    "we obtain expressions for the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries of the following kind : @xmath128 @xmath129    consequently , we have four observables at our disposal , depending on six `` unknowns '' .",
    "however , since @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , the @xmath59-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions implies @xmath130 using this relation , the four observables in ( [ bpipi - obs ] ) and ( [ bskk - obs ] ) depend on the four quantities @xmath118 , @xmath131 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 , which can hence be determined @xcite . the theoretical accuracy is only limited by the @xmath59-spin symmetry , as no dynamical assumptions about rescattering processes have to be made .",
    "theoretical considerations give us confidence into ( [ u - spin - rel ] ) , as it does not receive @xmath59-spin - breaking corrections within factorization @xcite .",
    "moreover , we may also obtain experimental insights into @xmath59-spin breaking @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59-spin arguments can be minimized , if the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase @xmath5 , which can be fixed through @xmath7 , is used as an input .",
    "the observables @xmath110 and @xmath109 allow us then to eliminate the strong phase @xmath131 and to determine @xmath118 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "analogously , @xmath132 and @xmath133 allow us to eliminate the strong phase @xmath134 and to determine @xmath135 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding contours in the @xmath2@xmath118 and @xmath2@xmath135 planes can be fixed in a _ theoretically clean _ way .",
    "using now the @xmath59-spin relation @xmath136 , these contours allow the determination both of the ckm angle @xmath2 and of the hadronic quantities @xmath118 , @xmath131 , @xmath134 ; for a detailed illustration , see @xcite .",
    "this approach is very promising for run ii of the tevatron and the experiments of the lhc era , where experimental accuracies for @xmath2 of @xmath137 @xcite and @xmath138 @xcite may be achieved , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that not only @xmath2 , but also the hadronic parameters @xmath118 , @xmath131 , @xmath134 are of particular interest , as they can be compared with theoretical predictions , thereby allowing important insights into hadron dynamics . for other recently developed @xmath59-spin strategies ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .      since @xmath9 is not accessible at the @xmath10 @xmath0-factories operating at @xmath140 , data are not yet available . however , as can be seen by looking at the corresponding feynman diagrams , @xmath9 is related to @xmath11 through an interchange of spectator quarks .",

    "<S> we give an overview of direct determinations of the angles of the unitarity triangle of the ckm matrix , using cp - violating effects in @xmath0-meson decays . after a discussion of @xmath1 modes , which can be described efficiently through allowed regions in observable space and play an important rle to determine @xmath2 , we turn to extractions of the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase @xmath5 , which equals @xmath6 in the standard model , from @xmath7 , and emphasize that it is important to determine this phase unambiguously . finally , we focus on @xmath8 , where recent @xmath0-factory data point towards large penguin contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the question arises now how the cp - violating observables of this mode can be transformed into information on the angles of the unitarity triangle . a promising tool to achieve this goal is offered by @xmath9 , which is very accessible at hadronic @xmath0 experiments , and allows a determination of @xmath5 and @xmath2 . a variant for the @xmath10 @xmath0-factories is provided by @xmath11 , where data are already available , pointing to an exciting picture and a highly constrained allowed region in @xmath9 observable space .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < \" , ]     relations between the @xmath1 amplitudes that are implied by the @xmath12 isospin flavour symmetry of strong interactions suggest the following combinations to probe @xmath2 : the `` mixed '' @xmath13 , @xmath11 system @xcite@xcite , the `` charged '' @xmath13 , @xmath14 system @xcite@xcite , and the `` neutral '' @xmath15 , @xmath11 system @xcite . correspondingly </S>",
    "<S> , we may introduce the following sets of observables @xcite : @xmath16\\frac{\\tau_{b^+}}{\\tau_{b^0_d}}\\ ] ] @xmath17\\ ] ] @xmath18.\\ ] ] the experimental status of these observables is summarized in tables  [ tab : bpik - obs ] and [ tab : bpik - obs - cpv ] , where the cleo numbers refer to @xcite , and those of babar and belle to the recent updates reviewed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there are stringent constraints on cp violation in @xmath13 : @xmath19 let us note that a very recent preliminary study of belle indicates that the large asymmetry in ( [ acp - bc ] ) is due to a @xmath20 fluctuation @xcite . within the standard model , a sizeable value of @xmath21 could be induced by large rescattering effects . </S>",
    "<S> other important indicators for such processes are branching ratios for @xmath22 decays , which are already strongly contstrained by the @xmath0 factories , and would allow us to take into account rescattering effects in the extraction of @xmath2 from @xmath1 modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that also the qcd factorization approach @xcite is not in favour of large rescattering processes . for simplicity , we shall neglect such effects in the discussion given below .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , already cp - averaged @xmath1 branching ratios may lead to non - trivial constraints on @xmath2 @xcite , provided the corresponding @xmath23 observables are found to be sufficiently different from one . </S>",
    "<S> the final goal is , however , to determine @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> let us first turn to the charged and neutral @xmath1 systems in the following subsection .      </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our considerations are relations between the charged and neutral @xmath1 amplitudes that follow from the @xmath12 isospin symmetry of strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> assuming moreover that the rescattering effects discussed above are small , we arrive at a parametrization of the following structure @xcite ( for an alternative one , see @xcite ) : @xmath24 here @xmath25 measures  simply speaking  the ratio of tree to penguin topologies . using @xmath26 flavour - symmetry arguments and data on the cp - averaged @xmath27 branching ratio @xcite , we obtain @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath29 describes the ratio of ew penguin to tree contributions , and can be fixed through @xmath26 flavour - symmetry arguments , yielding @xmath30 @xcite . in order to simplify ( [ rcn - par ] ) and ( [ acn - par ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that @xmath29 is a real parameter , as is the case in the strict @xmath26 limit ; for generalizations , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath31 is the cp - conserving strong phase between trees and penguins .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the observables @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on the two `` unknowns '' @xmath31 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if we vary them within their allowed ranges , i.e.  @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we obtain an allowed region in the @xmath32@xmath33 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the measured values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 should lie outside this region , we would have an immediate signal for new physics . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the measurements should fall into the allowed range , @xmath2 and @xmath31 could be extracted . in this case , @xmath2 could be compared with the results of alternative strategies and the values implied by the `` standard analysis '' of the unitarity triangle discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , whereas @xmath31 provides valueable insights into hadron dynamics , thereby allowing tests of theoretical predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 @xmath37    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bpik - charged ] , we show the allowed regions in the @xmath38@xmath39 plane for various parameter sets . </S>",
    "<S> the crosses represent the averages of the experimental results given in tables  [ tab : bpik - obs ] and [ fig : bpik - charged ] . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is constrained to @xmath40 which corresponds to the `` standard - model '' range for @xmath2 implied by the fits of the unitarity triangle ( see ( [ ut - fit - ranges ] ) ) , a considerably more restricted range arises in the @xmath38@xmath39 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the contours in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bpik - charged ] ( c ) and ( d ) allow us to read off straightforwardly the preferred values for @xmath2 and @xmath41 , respectively , from the measured observables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the present data seem to favour @xmath42 ( see also @xcite ) , which would be in conflict with ( [ gamma - sm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they point towards @xmath43 ; factorization predicts @xmath41 to be close to @xmath44 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if future , more accurate data should really yield a value for @xmath2 in the second quadrant , the discrepancy with ( [ gamma - sm ] ) may be due to new - physics contributions to @xmath45@xmath46 mixing ( @xmath47 ) or the @xmath1 decay amplitudes . in the former case , the constraints due to ( [ dms - constr ] ) , which rely on the standard - model interpretation of @xmath45@xmath46 mixing , </S>",
    "<S> would no longer hold , so that @xmath2 may actually be larger than @xmath48 . as we shall see in section  [ sec : bpipi ] , new data on cp violation in @xmath8 would allow us to accommodate also this picture @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in the latter case , the standard - model expressions ( [ rcn - par ] ) and ( [ acn - par ] ) would receive corrections due to new physics , so that also the extracted value for @xmath2 would not correspond to the standard - model result . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed and explicit discussions of such new - physics scenarios can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the allowed regions and contours for the neutral @xmath1 system in the @xmath49@xmath50 plane look very similar to those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bpik - charged ] @xcite . unfortunately , the experimental situation in the neutral @xmath1 system is still rather unstable . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the recent belle update @xcite , the central value for @xmath49 has moved from 0.6 to 1.4 . in the neutral strategy , another interesting observable </S>",
    "<S> is provided by the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of @xmath51 , which arises in the corresponding time - dependent rate asymmetry of the following kind  @xcite : @xmath52 in the standard model , we expect @xcite @xmath53 which may well be affected by new - physics contributions , preferrably to the @xmath54 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the extraction of @xmath2 from neutral @xmath1 decays discussed above , this cp asymmetry would allow us to take into account possible rescattering effects in an exact manner @xcite , i.e.  without using flavour - symmetry arguments .      after the discussion of the charged and neutral @xmath1 systems in subsection  [ bpik - cn ] , the mixed @xmath1 system consisting of @xmath13 , @xmath11 can be described straightforwardly by just making appropriate replacements of variables : first , we have @xmath55 , where the determination of @xmath56 requires the use of factorizaton to fix a colour - allowed amplitude @xmath57 @xcite , or a measurement of @xmath58 and @xmath59-spin arguments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we may set @xmath60 , as ew penguins contribute only in colour - suppressed form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain then the following expressions : @xmath61 which are symmetric under @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> if we vary the cp - conserving strong phase @xmath63 and the cp - violating angle @xmath2 within their physical ranges , we obtain an allowed region in the @xmath64@xmath65 plane , as shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data fall well into the allowed region , but do not yet allow us to draw further definite conclusions . at present , the situation in the charged and neutral @xmath1 systems appears to be more exciting .      </S>",
    "<S> a study complementary to the one of the allowed regions in observable space discussed above was performed in @xcite , where the allowed regions in the @xmath2@xmath31 planes implied by @xmath1 data were explored . </S>",
    "<S> another recent @xmath1 analysis can be found in @xcite , where the @xmath66 were calculated for given values of @xmath67 as functions of @xmath2 , and were compared with the @xmath0-factory data . making more extensive use of theory than in the flavour - symmetry strategies discussed in subsections  [ bpik - cn ] and [ bpik - mix ] , several different avenues to extract @xmath2 from @xmath1 modes </S>",
    "<S> are provided by the qcd factorization approach @xcite , which allows also a reduction of the theoretical uncertainties of the flavour - symmetry approaches , in particular a better control of @xmath26-breaking effects . in order to analyse @xmath1 data , also </S>",
    "<S> a set of sum rules relating cp - averaged branching ratios and cp asymmetries of @xmath68 modes may be useful @xcite . </S>"
