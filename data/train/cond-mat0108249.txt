    "one incentive to use a conserved - order parameter is simply that density is conserved microscopically ( apart from applications where etching or sublimation is important ) . in general , a non - conserved phase - field will give a non - zero velocity even for a straight material interface @xcite .",

    "fracture often occurs in crystalline materials , and it therefore seems reasonable to add anisotropy to quantities such as mobility , surface tension , and elastic strain energy .",
    "there might also be unwanted anisotropy included due to the underlying grid in the numerical solver , and one might be able to repress this effect by adding `` counter''-anisotropy in the quantities mentioned above .",
    "in addition to anisotropy , one could add some noise ; either spatially in the hamiltonian or initial conditions , which would break the symmetry and add heterogeneities , or temporally , which would mimic the effects of fluctuations due to a finite temperature .    because of the fourth - order gradients , our simulation is rather numerically intensive .",
    "using a multiresolution grid would speed up the calculation@xcite .",
    "the main idea is that additional information can be added between existing grid points where a linear interpolation would give poor results ( that is , add grid points locally where the solution has high frequency components ) .",
    "this way one can achieve a solution with uniform accuracy and avoid unnecessary use of computational resources",
    ". a similar approach can be found in@xcite , where an adaptive mesh in a phase - field solidification problem is used to add detail only at the boundaries where it is needed .    currently , the numerical integration of the phase - field equations is done partly using fourier transforms .",
    "this allows us to do all the linear parts of the equations implicitly without solving huge linear systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the current implementations puts several limitations on the kind of simulations that can be done ; especially , it is hard to do simulations with other than periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it thus seems beneficial to use real - space implicit methods ( and perhaps add in multi - resolution capabilities at the same time ) .",
    "this paper is only concerned with mode i fracture in two dimensions .",
    "it would seem reasonable to try to extend the model to include mode ii and mode iii as well .",
    "mode ii could be done either by shearing the model with a crack running vertical or horizontal , or by squeezing one way and extending the other with a strain @xmath160 and 45 degree crack , where @xmath160 is equal to the shear strain divided by @xmath161 .",
    "one way to start exploring mode ii could be to use finite element calculations to get an initial sheared configuration , and then use the phase - field model to relax this system .",
    "mode iii has recently been explored in ref .",
