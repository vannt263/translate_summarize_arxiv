    "epidemic outbreak in a populated center or in a network of populated centra develops stochastically due to random interaction between individuals inside a center and due to a random migration between centers of the network .",
    "conventionally , an epidemic outbreak in a highly populated center is described by deterministic processes in according with law of large numbers ( lln ) @xcite .",
    "the mean field approximation ( hydrodynamic limits ) of the appropriate statistical models establishes the basic relation of stochastic description to the dynamical equations , say the sir model ( susceptible / infected/ removed ) and its more sophisticated modifications ( seir , sis , msir , etc . )    however , there are two important cases when stochastic effects are essential .",
    "firstly , it is obviously important when the populations in centers are not large .",
    "the second less obvious scenario can occur at the initial stage of outbreak when the number of infectives is small , then the discreteness of population can essentially affect the dynamics of the outbreak making it stochastic . for an isolated center , this case",
    "is thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "analysis of a network of interacting epidemic centers requires an account of migration fluxes between them .",
    "so , if the initial number of infectives triggering the outbreak in a particular populated center is small ( that is typical for many outbreaks ) than the lln fails at least at initial stage until the number of infectives is large enough .",
    "for this reason the observed number of infectives can be significantly different from the prediction of a deterministic model , i.e. the standard deviation of the number of infectives and the peak outbreak time can be wide even in highly populated center or a network of such centers .    in principle",
    ", the probability density function ( pdf ) , its standard deviation , and other important characteristics for the outbreak forecast could be determined by a direct numerical simulation .",
    "however , this simulation may be very costly and require too much cpu time even for modern computers .",
    "our goal is to develop a technique for a rough estimation of the outbreak statistical characteristics skipping such huge computation by applying some perturbation methods .",
    "our toolkit is the so - called small initial contagion ( sic ) approximation for the case of a large populated center when initial number of infectives is small , cf .",
    "@xcite in the case of a single populated center . for a network of",
    "highly populated sir centers in the framework of deterministic model such technique is described in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop a stochastic version of sic approach based on the assumption that in the real epidemic centra the number of infectives triggering an outbreak is still small . in a sense",
    ", the sic approach looks like a key to solving cumbersome epidemic networks .    in @xcite , a randomized analogue of the standard sir model",
    "is considered . in the sic approximation ,",
    "one distinguishes two linked stages of epidemic evolution . at the stage 1 of initial contamination",
    "the number of infectives is small and a discrete formulation is vital . at this stage",
    "the system is randomized , and governed by stochastic equations . at the stage 2 of developed outbreak",
    "when the numbers of individuals in all the components are large the lln works and the standard deterministic sir model can describe the outbreak process accurately enough . therefore it is natural to consider a deterministic system with randomized initial conditions linked to the stochastic stage  1 .",
    "the statistical characteristics of the complete model are obtained by applying deterministic equations with random initial conditions using the matching asymptotic expansions technique ( cf .",
    "in contrast to the traditional technique , the asymptotic approximation of a randomized evolution ( at a brief initial period ) is matched with a deterministic evolution with randomized initial conditions ( for all other times ) .",
    "nevertheless , as in the traditional approach , we match the approximations at some intermediate time @xmath4 in the interval where the both approximations are valid and which drops out from the final results ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the markov chain ( mc ) describing the randomized sir model has been studied previously , e.g. , in @xcite where a partial differential equation ( pde ) for the moment generating function was derived .",
    "we develop a similar approach for a pair of linked centers and obtain approximate formulae for their main statistical characteristics .",
    "the results of large - scale numerical simulation are in a good agreement with the appropriate models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mc ] we introduce a mc model describing randomized epidemic outbreak in two populated centers coupled by a random migration of all types of species .",
    "here we consider convergence of this model to a deterministic mean - field model proposed in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : migration ] we describe a model of random migration between two interacting sir centers taking place before the outbreak started to determine all the initial conditions for the mc model .",
    "migration between centers is also described as a markov chain .",
    "here we derive the master / kolmogorov s equations for the probability generating functions ( pgf ) and solve them analytically .",
    "this analysis confirms the diffusion - like model of migration heuristically proposed in @xcite . in section  [ sec : numerics ] the numerical algorithm for direct solving the mc model is described , the dependence of outbreak parameters on the population size , initial number of infectives and migration parameters are presented and discussed . in section  [ sec : sic ] the generalization of the mc model on an arbitrary network of the epidemic centers is studied , and difficulties of direct numerical modelling are estimated . here the simplified model which looks relevant for a network of a highly populated centers is proposed . in discussions",
    "we make a comparison with some previously considered models and outline the perspective of the future development .",
    "consider two populated nodes , 1 and 2 , with populations @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 be the numbers of host susceptibles , infectives and removed , respectively , in node  @xmath10 at time @xmath4 .",

    "note that in the standard sir model , removed individuals do not interact with other species , do not affect dynamics of susceptibles and infectives , and can be omitted from consideration @xcite .",
    "assume that the populations in every node is completely mixed , the contamination rate @xmath15 of a susceptible individual in node @xmath10 at time interval @xmath16 $ ] is proportional to the number of all infectives in node @xmath10 : host infectives @xmath17 at time @xmath4 plus guest infectives @xmath18 immigrated from node @xmath14 .",
    "next , every infective in node @xmath19 can be removed with probability rate @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the model is described by the migration rate @xmath21 from node @xmath10 to node @xmath14 and return rate @xmath22 for a guest individual to return to his host node , they may be different for different species , i.e.  we specify the migration process for susceptibles by parameters @xmath23,@xmath24 and for infectives@xmath25,@xmath26 ( cf .",
    "obviously , return rate of the host node should be higher than the migration rate to a neighbour node , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
