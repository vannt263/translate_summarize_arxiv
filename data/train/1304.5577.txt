    "single particle tracking experiments in biological systems often show that diffusion is not normal but rather anomalous @xcite ; that is , the mean square displacement ( msd ) does not grow linearly with time but follows a power - law scaling @xmath0 because anomalous diffusions including subdiffusion ( @xmath1 ) as well as superdiffusion ( @xmath2 ) are ubiquitously observed in many biological experiments , anomalous diffusion is believed to play significant roles in cell biology such as gene regulation @xcite and active transports @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying physical mechanisms remain controversial .    to understand the underlying mechanisms of these anomalous diffusions , phenomenological models such as continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) , lvy walk and flight , and other stochastic models of anomalous diffusion",
    "have been intensively studied @xcite . among these models",
    ", ctrw shows a prominent feature called _ distributional ergodicity _",
    "@xcite ; that is , the time average of an observable converges to a random variable , i.e. , _ convergence in distribution _ , but it does not coincide with the ensemble average as in the ordinary sense of ergodicity . it is considered that this distributional behavior of time - averaged observables in ctrw is related to large fluctuations of transport coefficients in single particle tracking experiments @xcite .",
    "it is known that such distributional behavior is universal in _ infinite ergodic theory _",
    "@xcite , where ergodicity is satisfied with respect to an infinite ( non - normalizable ) invariant measure .",
    "this is a completely different feature from other stochastic models of subdiffusion .",
    "while uncoupled ctrws , in which trapping time and jump length are mutually independent , are extensively studied , effects of a coupling between them become physically important for nonthermal systems such as cells @xcite . in such nonthermal systems , a particle in a trapped state",
    "would not be simply frozen , but rather it would be storing a sort of energy for the next jump .",
    "thus , a random walk driven by an stored energy during a trapped state is essential in such nonthermal systems , and it will also be important in complex systems such    as finance @xcite and earthquakes @xcite .    as a prototype model of such nonthermal random walks , we study a ctrw with jump lengths correlated with trapping times @xcite , which we refer to as the stored - energy - driven lvy flight ( sedlf ) .",
    "the sedlf exhibits a whole spectrum of diffusion : sub- , normal- , and super - diffusion , depending on a parameter @xmath3 , which characterizes the coupling strength between jump length and trapping time . here , we show a novel type of distributional ergodicity .",
    "in particular , time - averaged observables such as the time - averaged msds ( tamsds ) are intrinsically random even when the measurement time goes to infinity .",
    "the sedlf is based on ctrw with a non - separable joint probability of trapping time and jump length . in general ,",
    "ctrw is defined through the joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the probability that a random walker jumps with length @xmath6 just after it is trapped for period @xmath7 since its previous jump @xcite . in particular",
    ", the separable case @xmath8 , in which the jump length and the trapping time are mutually independent , has been extensively studied @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a non - separable case defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pdf of trapping times and @xmath11 $ ] is a coupling strength .",
    "note that a random walker undergoes a long trapped state before it performs a long jump ( fig .",
    "[ traf_alpha=0.7 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the pdf of trapping times follows a power law : @xmath12 as @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the stable index , a constant @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 with a scale factor @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the sedlf is just a separable ctrw with jumps only to the nearest neighbor sites . on the other hand , for @xmath19 ,",
    "the pdf of jump follows a power law : @xmath20 thus , the mean jump length diverges for @xmath21 .",
    "note that the lvy flight also has a power law distribution of jump length , which causes a divergence in the msd .",
    "by contrast , the msd of the sedlf is finite with the aid of the coupling between jump lengths and trapping times as shown below .",
    "this property makes the sedlf a physically more coherent model than lvy flight .     and @xmath22 ) .",
