    "this work is the third of a series in which we are analyzing the possible biases present in mass functions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "i have used a combination of analytical approximations and monte carlo simulations to study the effect of the stochastic sampling of the stellar imf ( simf , assumed to be kroupa ) in the determination of masses and ages of unresolved stellar custers from broad - band photometry . for this purpose",
    "i have used the new ( 3.1 ) version of chorizos ( @xcite ) , which incorporates an evolutionary synthesis module . for a given mass and age ,",
    "i generated a minimum of 10000 realizations of the simf using solar metallicity [ a ] geneva isochrones for massive stars and [ b ] padova isochrones with new agb treatment for low and intermediate masses .",
    "in each case i measured the mass ( and age , if appropriate ) assuming that the cluster has a well - sampled simf . from the individual realizations i derived [ a ] the observed cluster mass and age distributions for clusters of a ( fixed ) real mass and age and [ b ] the observed cluster mass functions ( cmfs ) for a real truncated power - law cmf with a slope of @xmath3 .",
    "three different cases in order of complexity were considered : [ a ] single - filter observations of clusters with known age and extinction , [ b ] multi - filter observations of clusters with unknown age and known extinction , and [ c ] multi - filter observations of clusters with unknown age and extinction . in the first case masses were computed directly by converting filter - convolved luminosities to masses while in the second and third cases a @xmath4 minimization code ( chorizos ) was used to derive the masses and ages .",

    "and gaussian and gamma fits for 10 ma clusters observed in @xmath5 with four real masses : 300  m@xmath6 ( upper left ) , 1000  m@xmath6 ( upper right ) , 10000  m@xmath6 ( lower left ) , and 100000  m@xmath6 ( lower right ) .",
    "the poisson mass @xmath7 for this filter and age is 566 m@xmath6 . for large real masses ,",
    "both fits provide reasonable approximations but for small values of @xmath8 , the gamma approximation is significantly better .",
