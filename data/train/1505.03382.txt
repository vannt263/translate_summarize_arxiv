    "transport of energy is a phenomenon of the utmost importance in several domains of physics .",
    "recent advancements in manipulations of systems approaching quantum scales have further triggered research on transport between single quantum entities @xcite .",
    "this interest has a two - fold reason : first , the understanding of energy fluxes is necessary for controlling micro- and nanoscale devices @xcite ; second , purely quantum effects allow for energy management not achievable in classical scenarios @xcite .",
    "probably the most celebrated of these effects is the role of quantum coherence in photosynthetic efficiency @xcite .",
    "stimulated by these results , quantum excitation transport in networks of two - level systems ( tlss ) has recently received an enormous deal of attention @xcite . in this context , the interaction of tlss with various types of environments has been largely investigated @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effect of thermal blackbody radiation has been studied using phenomenological models only including local noise acting on each atom @xcite , which typically deteriorates transport as temperature increases .",
    "this approach , neglecting non - local effects induced by the radiation , led the attention mostly on low - temperature transport , where non - locality is indeed marginal .    in this letter , through a microscopic model , we explore excitation transport along tlss in a common thermal blackbody radiation at arbitrary temperature , fully taking into account radiation - induced non - local effects .",
    "we show that the collective non - local dissipation due to the correlations of the thermal radiation may have a dramatic effect on transport : unexpectedly , transport efficiency may _ increase _ with temperature up to values far beyond @xmath0 .",
    "we consider @xmath1 identical two - level quantum emitters ( hereby referred to as _ atoms _ ) of frequency @xmath2 with ground ( excited ) state @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , embedded in a blackbody radiation at temperature @xmath5 .",

    "due to thermal excitations , energy is extracted from @xmath31 also in the absence of pumping ( @xmath43 ) : the sink , through atom @xmath31 , absorbs thermal photons from the field at a rate @xmath44 . to evaluate how effective the transport of excitations from @xmath29 to @xmath31 is",
    ", one can analyse the contribution to extracted flux due to pumping only , as expressed by the transport efficiency @xmath45 when @xmath46 , @xmath47 , i.e. , the extracted excitations are more than the sum of the thermal and the pumped ones : as will be shown in the following , efficiency will largely overcome @xmath0 thanks to the combination of thermal noise and non - local effects .",
    "the definition of @xmath48 does not include energy fluxes between atoms and the blackbody radiation and , as such , @xmath48 is not upper - limited by @xmath49 .",

    "hence both @xmath50 and @xmath51 diverge linearly in @xmath40 and @xmath52 is the fraction of total pumped energy one recovers at the extraction site .",
    "following eq .",

    "we remark that dissipation plays here an active role in transporting excitations coherently [ eq .",

    "we apply now this theory to transport through five - atom rings of radius @xmath65 m , as in fig .",
    "planar ring configurations have been studied as a simpler prototype of light - harvesting physics @xcite .",
    "the atomic frequency is @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and dipoles lie along the axis perpendicular to the ring .",
    "these parameters are in accordance with some typical values found in , e.g. , quantum dots @xcite , hyperfine structure of real atoms and molecular vibrational states . moreover , although not usually met in biological light - harvesting complexes @xcite , these parameters will permit us to highlight more clearly the general importance of the non - local dissipation in transport phenomena .",
    "the pumping rate is @xmath68 , to simulate low - intensity light impinging on the system , while the extraction rate @xmath69 , in accordance with typical sink rates in light harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "thanks to this choice , all the term in the me are proportional to @xmath70 . in",
    "what follows we will therefore work in units of @xmath70 .",
    "pumping and extraction are exerted as shown in fig .",
    "all the results reported hereafter are obtained using the open - source qutip package @xcite .",
    "three different geometrical dispositions are considered .",
    "first , atoms are placed on the vertices of a regular pentagon ( rp ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] ( blue points ) . in this case",
    "two paths , clock- and counterclockwise , exist for excitations to travel to atom @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath5 is high enough , it is known that field - induced effects can create multipartite correlations in symmetric atomic configurations @xcite : excitations get delocalised over the whole atomic system and transport efficiency is strongly reduced .",
    "[ 2d ] shows that transport is indeed rapidly killed by thermal noise .",
    "the second configuration is obtained through a displacement of atom 2 from its regular position of an angle @xmath21 ( green dots in fig .",
    "we refer to this configuration as clockwise hopping ( ch ) : the fast decay of @xmath71 with the interatomic distance @xmath72 induces a bias between the two hopping directions .",
    "excitations are mostly transmitted along the path @xmath73 with fewer destructive interference : @xmath74 for this configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] ( dashed green line ) . in accordance with hopping physics , local noise disturbs excitation transmission , continuously reducing its efficiency with increasing @xmath5 .    finally ,",
    "also the second pathway is killed by displacing the atom @xmath29 closer to atom @xmath75 , such that a symmetric configuration is obtained ( orange points in fig .",
    "a natural expectation is that transport becomes hardly possible due to the vanishing hopping amplitude ( no - hopping configuration nh ) .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath74 shows a pronounced maximum in @xmath5 , at efficiencies higher than @xmath76 : remarkably when hopping is killed , the increase in extracted excitations becomes larger than pumping .",
    "there being no hopping , such an enormous gain of excitations origins from @xmath54 , by which atoms can affect each other s internal energy through collective field - induced dissipation .    to better understand this mechanism ,",
    "the atomic system can be divided into three subsets : the pair @xmath77 where excitations arrive , the pair @xmath78 which transmits these excitations and the monomer @xmath79 in contact with the sink , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ nlhop ] .",
    "only a small fraction of excitations jumps directly from @xmath29 to @xmath31 , the largest part travelling along the main path @xmath80 .",
    "( orange solid line ) , @xmath81 ( green dashed line ) and the principal contributions to all stages of the main path .",
    "the first stage @xmath82 in ch and nh configurations happens through different physical effects : hopping @xmath83 for ch , non - local dissipation @xmath84 for nh . ]    since local heat fluxes can not affect transport due to the markovian structure of the environment , the only possible mechanisms responsible for excitation transmission between atoms are hopping and non - local dissipation . to analyse them",
    ", we introduce @xmath85 representing the fraction of pumped excitations travelling to the subset @xmath86 through either hopping ( @xmath83 ) from or non - local dissipation ( @xmath84 ) with each atom of the subset @xmath87 .",
    "[ nlhop ] shows , for both nh and ch configurations , the quantities @xmath74 and @xmath88 versus @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the mechanism responsible for the last stage @xmath89 of the main path is hopping : the curves @xmath90 ( solid orange and dotted green lines ) and @xmath91 ( dotted black and dashed blue lines ) are remarkably similar , showing that almost all the energy extracted from @xmath31 arrives there through hopping from atoms 3 and 5 .",
    "a striking difference appears however in the first stage @xmath82 : in ch case , it is again mostly due to hopping from pair @xmath77 to pair @xmath78 , as shown by @xmath92 ( brown dot - dot - dashed line ) .",
    "non - local transport @xmath93 ( not shown here ) is indeed negligible . on the other hand",
    ", the stage @xmath82 in nh setup has a large contribution from collective non - local dissipation as highlighted by the non - local energy exchanges @xmath94 ( red dot - dashed line ) : the pumping of excitations on @xmath29 triggers the electromagnetic field to inject photons into both atomic pairs .",
    "note that , as a consequence , excitations received by @xmath78 can exceed the ones pumped into @xmath29 , the difference being supplied by the field : @xmath94 accounts almost exactly for the additional parts of excitations travelling to @xmath31 .",
    "energy arriving on @xmath78 completes then its path by hopping to @xmath31 .     versus @xmath5 and angular displacement @xmath95 of @xmath29 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the dashed white line is the contour @xmath96 .",
    "the horizontal dot - dashed line represents the nh configuration ( @xmath22 ) , where transport efficiency is maximised . ]",
    "following eq .",
    ", non - local energy flux is proportional to the real part of the quantum coherence between two atoms .",
    "transport in nh configuration is thus a dissipation - induced coherent effect .",
    "the importance of the symmetric positions of atoms @xmath29 and @xmath75 in creating a pair is proved by the dependence of @xmath74 on the angular displacement @xmath95 of @xmath29 , reported in fig .",
    "there , @xmath97 corresponds to ch configuration .",
    "note that the role of symmetry on quantum correlations and quantum transport was already pointed out in different contexts @xcite .",
    "the reason why these non - local effects do not contribute when hopping is significant is twofold : first , when hopping is active there can be no isolated subset of atoms where pumping is exerted , while such subset is present in nh configuration ( pair @xmath77 ) .",
    "this subset , having a much larger excited - state population than the rest of the system due to pumping on it , drives the collective atomic state further away from a purely thermal state , thus allowing the establishing of steady quantum coherence : we develop in the next section a simple toy model able to grasp this mechanism .",
    "the second reason comes from the timescales of different dynamical processes : fig .",
    "[ chit ] shows the time- and @xmath5-dependence of @xmath98 in rp [ panel ( a ) ] , ch [ panel ( b ) ] and nh [ panel ( c ) ] configurations with initial state @xmath99 .",
    "compare panels ( b ) and ( c ) : transport through hopping ( b ) happens on much shorter timescales than the non - local one , as expectable since @xmath100 .",
    "as long as hopping is active , non - locality can not play any substantial role : by the time non - locality becomes effective , excitations have already travelled through hopping .",
    "excitations reach @xmath31 in @xmath101 in ch setup and stationarity is attained for @xmath102 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath103 becomes non - negligible in @xmath104 , while stationarity is reached for @xmath105 .",
    "nonetheless , at suitable temperatures , @xmath106 is enough for transport efficiency in nh configurations to go beyond @xmath49 ( white dashed line in panel ( c ) ) , fully entering the non - local amplification regime .",
    "the pairs @xmath77 and @xmath78 in nh configurations are almost not connected by hopping .",
    "excitations pumped in @xmath77 can thus hardly leave the pair , and the excited state populations of atoms @xmath29 and 2 grow remarkably with respect to those in @xmath78 .",
    "the effect is thus to create a gap in populations between two branches of the atomic system .",
    "this means that the system itself is no longer in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium and can thus sustain quantum coherence between its subparts . to understand this on a more quantitative basis , consider a toy model of two atoms , having the same me as eq . but",
    "with @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , a population gap is imposed by two different blackbody reservoirs , one for each atom , such that @xmath108 in eqs .",
    "- is different for the two atoms .",
    "in particular , one atom is connected to a hot reservoir with @xmath109 ( simulating the effect of pumping ) , while the other one is connected to a reservoir with @xmath110 . non - local effects are also assumed to happen at @xmath111 .",
    "the atoms coherence @xmath112 in the decoupled basis is always real and depends on @xmath113 and @xmath111 as @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] under the natural condition @xmath116 , @xmath117 shows a maximum as a function of @xmath113 at @xmath118 . despite its simplicity",
    ", then , this toy model gives already important hints to better understand the physics of non - local transport : driving a collective atomic state far from its gibbs form by imposing a population gap between two parts generates real quantum coherence between them , with a sharp peak when an optimal gap is achieved .",
    "this , in turn , means a sharp peak in the non - local energy flux involving the two subparts .",
    "the symmetric displacement characterising nh configurations produces exactly such an optimal value of population gap .",
    "we consider next a 3d setup inspired by the celebrated fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex @xcite , a pigment - protein complex used for photosynthesis .",
    "light is collected and transmitted by 7 molecular complexes ( schematically seen as tlss ) to a sink , where it is used for biological functions .",
    "nowadays , its high light - transport efficiency is believed to have quantum origins @xcite .",
    "its transport properties , as a function of temperature of a photonic bath , have been studied in @xcite , but non - local dissipation has there been neglected .",
    "the spatial configuration of the 7-site system we study is shown in fig .",
    "[ fmo ] , obtained from the fmo site configuration ( given for instance in @xcite ) by rescaling each site - site distance by a factor @xmath119 .",
    "typical lifetimes of excitations in fmo complexes are @xmath120 @xcite , while extraction time can be of the order of @xmath121 : we set @xmath122 .",
    "the ratio @xmath123 is compatible with the low - intensity light impinging on the molecule , having verified this value to be low enough for the @xmath124-dependence of @xmath74 to be flat .",
    "there being no preferential direction is this system , we choose the dipoles to lie along the @xmath125-axis of fig . [ fmo ] .",
    "versus @xmath5 in fmo geometry , with site - site distances scaled with respect to the fmo complex by a factor @xmath126 .",
    "the black dashed line represents the case @xmath127 , the solid red line is the efficiency obtained when @xmath128 . ]",
    "it is important to stress that , by this configuration , we do not intend to analyse the exact physics of transport in fmo complexes where transition frequencies , dipole orientations , intersite distances and environment are much different from the ones considered here @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "since the relative weight of non - local effects over hopping is ultimately due to configurations of sites in a network , uncovering their role in a geometry analogous to the fmo might shed light on equivalent effect during photosynthesis and suggest how to enhance transport performances in artificial realisations .",
    "the fmo geometry shows indeed two sites ( @xmath29 and @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fmo ] ) , relatively closer to each other than to the rest of the complex .",
    "plots in fig .",
    "[ fmo ] show @xmath74 versus @xmath5 in the absence ( dashed black line ) and in the presence ( solid red line ) of @xmath129 : the presence of non - local effects produces two interesting features : first , @xmath74 is always higher if @xmath128 .",
    "second , it introduces a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath5 very similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] , suggesting an important contribution of non - local energy transfer .    for completeness",
    ", we have also simulated the exact fmo complex , where absorption happens mostly around @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) @xcite , using the exact intersite distances and dipole orientations @xcite .",
    "for this high frequency , @xmath132 does not significantly change around room temperature and the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath74 is flat .",
    "nonetheless , non - local effects still play a significant role : @xmath133 when @xmath127 , while @xmath134 if @xmath128 , increasing transport efficiency of @xmath135 .",
    "we showed that the energy transport in atomic quantum systems can be considerably affected by embedding them in an electromagnetic thermal bath .",
    "non - local effects induced by the thermal field , neglected in previous investigations , are shown to play an active role in coherent excitation transport and to boost its efficiency , which grows with temperature , up to values largely overcoming @xmath0 in planar configurations .",
    "this mechanism originates from non - local self - correlations of electromagnetic radiation , which induce collective dissipation in atoms : when they are brought out of equilibrium by local pumping and extraction , thermally - activated collective effects inject a great amount of excitations in the system and drastically increase energy extraction from it .",
    "these results suggest to exploit the intrinsic non - locality of thermal noise as a resource to improve quantum energy transport , with direct applications to condensed - matter systems , to nanoscale energy management , and possibly being of great relevance also for light - harvesting      32 n. li , j. ren , l. wang , g. zhang , p. hnggi , and b. li , rev .",
