    "in the last 15 years , it has been believed that braneworld models may give a solution to the problem of the extremely large hierarchy between the planck scale , @xmath4 , and the weak scale , @xmath3 . in 1998 , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali first tried resolving the hierarchy problem by using a braneworld model@xcite .",
    "their explanation is as the follows : first , they assume a flat @xmath5-dimensional space - time , in which the extra @xmath6-dimensions are compactified by a common radius @xmath7 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath5-dimensional planck mass @xmath8 and the 4-dimensional one @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 second , they assume that the fundamental scale is only the tev scale , @xmath11 . therefore , @xmath8 should be of order @xmath11 .",
    "this means that a too large @xmath9 is specific to the 4-dimensional theory , and the large hierarchy does not exist in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , if we take the number of the extra dimensions @xmath6 as @xmath12 , eq",
    ".   implies that the radius @xmath7 is approximately @xmath13 .",
    "this does not contradict experiments , since the newton s law has been verified only at distances larger than @xmath14 .",
    "however , note that the energy scale of @xmath15 is much smaller than the weak scale . to avoid a hierarchy in the @xmath5-dimensions , we have @xmath16 independent of the number of the extra dimensions @xmath6 . ] in other words , the hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale is just replaced by the one between the weak scale and the radius @xmath7 .",
    "in keeping with this problem , randall and sundrum proposed a new braneworld model ( the rs model)@xcite .",
    "first , they assume a 5-dimensional space - time with negative 5-dimensional cosmological constant @xmath1 and warped extra dimension @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the extra dimension is compactified by @xmath18 with radius @xmath7 .",
    "under these assumptions , the metric is given by @xmath19 hence , two branes are _ naturally _ introduced at the fixed points , @xmath20 .",
    "second , they assume the energy scales ( the vacuum expectation values of the higgs boson ) on the two branes to be @xmath4 ( the planck scale ) and @xmath3 ( the weak scale ) , respectively .",
    "this means that the hierarchy does not exist on the former brane ( the planck brane ) , since its energy scale is equal to the 4-dimensional planck mass @xmath9 .",
    "we live on the latter brane ( the tev brane ) , where the energy scale is equal to the weak scale .",
    "then , the large hierarchy on the tev brane is realized by the @xmath21 hierarchy , @xmath22 , between the 5-dimensional quantities @xmath23 and @xmath15",
    ". moreover , we find that the 5-dimensional planck mass @xmath24 is of the same order as @xmath23 and @xmath15 . in this way , the 4-dimensional hierarchy is _ naturally _ explained in the 5-dimensional theory without any unnaturally large hierarchies among the 5-dimensional quantities .",
    "however , the rs model does not represent our acceleratively expanding universe , since the 4-dimensional space - time on the branes is assumed to be flat .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the models in which the 4-dimensional space - time on our brane is @xmath0 .",
    "of course , there have been some papers studying such models , for example , @xcite . in the later two papers@xcite",
    ", the author assumes one warped and uncompactified extra dimension @xmath17 with negative @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , he introduces only a single brane with @xmath0 space - time .",
    "then , the 5-dimensional metric of the model is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter and @xmath27 is an arbitrary constant . in this model ,",
    "the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath9 is given by @xmath28 however , this is divergent at @xmath29 , and therefore , we can not discuss the hierarchy problem in this model .",
    "the above divergence problem of is from the infinitely large integration range , namely , the uncompactified extra dimension .",
    "if we compactify the extra dimension by @xmath18 similarly to the rs model , two branes are naturally introduced at the fixed points .",
    "then , the integration in becomes finite , and we can discuss the hierarchy problem .",
    "in other words , for making it possible to discuss the hierarchy problem , we need to introduce ( at least ) two branes .",
    "in addition , since we have no apriori reason to restrict ourselves to the @xmath30 case , we will discuss the hierarchy problem for both the cases @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "we call this model where the space - time on the branes is @xmath0 `` the de sitter _ thin _ brane model '' for brevity . here , we have used the word `` thin '' to distinguish our model from _ thick _ brane models with smooth warp factors@xcite",
    ".    we should also examine the kaluza - klein modes for verifying the existence of the massless mode corresponding to the graviton , and non - existence of the light massive modes which could affect the newton s law .",
    "for this purpose , we need the exact expression of the wave function of the kaluza - klein modes , and this was constructed , for example , in@xcite . in the rs model ,",
    "both the lightest mass of the massive kaluza - klein modes and the intervals of the mass spectrum are of order @xmath3 , which suggests the possibility of the massive kaluza - klein particles being observed .",
    "it is interesting to study the observability of the kaluza - klein modes in our model .",
    "actually , in @xcite , the authors compactify the extra dimension and introduce two branes at the fixed points in the de sitter thin brane model .",
    "they discuss the hierarchy problem and the kaluza - klein modes in the model .",
    "however , the hubble parameter was not accurately determined at that time .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a complete analysis of the hierarchy problem and the kaluza - klein modes in the de sitter thin brane model by using the observed value of the hubble parameter .",
    "since our real universe has experienced much more complicated time evolution , namely , big - bang @xmath32 inflation @xmath32 reheating @xmath32 deceleration @xmath32 accelerative expansion ( current ) , we should introduce the time - dependent hubble parameter .",
    "however , in this paper , for simplicity , we focus only on the current universe with a constant hubble parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 appearing in the metric plays an important role in our model . before compactifying the @xmath17-direction to @xmath18",
    ", @xmath27 is merely the freedom of translation in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "however , after the compactification , if we put @xmath27 equal to zero , we will find that the brane tension is divergent and the model turns out to be _",
    "sick_. thus , for keeping the model _ sound _ , we must take non - zero @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , we will also find that the parameter @xmath27 is important in naturally explaining the large hierarchy in our model , since , after the compactification , the integration is finite and depends on @xmath27 .",
    "we will find the following three important facts for our de sitter thin brane model : recall that two branes are naturally introduced in the present model similarly to the rs model .",
    "first , in the case with @xmath30 , if we choose the energy scales on the two branes as @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively , the 5-dimensional quantities can be almost of the same order ; namely , the 4-dimensional large hierarchy is naturally realized in the 5-dimensional theory similarly to the rs model .",
    "however , for @xmath31 , we find that the large hierarchy in 4-dimensions necessarily implies a large hierarchy in 5-dimensions .",
    "thus , we conclude that we must choose @xmath30 to explain the hierarchy naturally .",
    "second , for @xmath30 , the lightest non - zero mass of the kaluza - klein modes and the intervals of the mass spectrum are both of order @xmath3 , which are insensitive to the value of the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , the lightest mass and the intervals in our model are the same as those in the rs model .",
    "finally , we find the importance of the parameter @xmath27 as we have already mentioned above .",
    "such a parameter certainly exists in the rs model .",
    "however , it only effects a constant multiplication to the warp factor , which can be offset by a rescaling of @xmath33 . on the other hand , in our model",
    ", @xmath27 has a physical meaning .",
    "especially , @xmath27 is related to the hubble parameter @xmath26 .",
    "another 4-dimensional large hierarchy between @xmath26 and the planck scale is realized by the @xmath2 hierarchy , @xmath34 , between the 5-dimensional quantities @xmath23 and @xmath35 .    from the above results , we conclude that our thin brane model with @xmath30 can represent our acceleratively expanding universe , and at the same time naturally explain the large hierarchy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we quickly review the rs model , with emphasis on the explanation of the hierarchy and the analysis of the kaluza - klein modes . in  3",
    ", we introduce the de sitter thin brane model and study various properties of it : explanation of the hierarchy problem , analysis of the graviton modes , and consideration of the important parameter @xmath27 .",
    "finally , in  4 , we discuss the possibility of making the hubble parameter time - dependent in our model .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the rs model for use in later sections .",
    "let us consider the 5-dimensional space - time @xmath36 described by the following bulk action with negative cosmological constant @xmath1 : @xmath37 where @xmath24 is 5-dimensional planck mass . under the metric assumption ,",
    "@xmath38 the solution to the einstein equation with the condition that the extra dimension @xmath17 is compactified by @xmath18 with radius @xmath7 is given by @xmath39 where the constant @xmath23 is defined by is essentially equivalent to @xmath40 .",
    "hence , we restrict @xmath23 to positive .",
    "[ fn : chansey ] ] @xmath41 the absolute value in is due to the compactification , and it causes the delta functions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in @xmath44 .",
    "because of these extra delta function terms , the einstein equation is in fact _ not _ satisfied at @xmath20 . to canceling the extra terms , we introduce the following two rigid brane actions located at @xmath20 : @xmath45 here",
    ", @xmath46 is the brane position , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the induced metric on the brane , @xmath49 from the requirement that the einstein equation of the whole system @xmath50 holds at @xmath20 , the tension @xmath51 is determined as @xmath52 in this way , the compactification to @xmath18 _ naturally _ introduces the branes .      in this subsection , we describe how the hierarchy is naturally explained in the rs model .",
    "we introduce the higgs field @xmath53 with symmetry breaking _ mexican hat like _ potential on each of the two branes located at @xmath20 : @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eq : wigglytuff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the coefficient of the kinetic term @xmath55 ( see ) is not equal to @xmath56 for the second brane , we redefine @xmath53 to normalize it .",
    "then , the vacuum expectation value @xmath57 of the redefined field @xmath58 on the brane @xmath59 is expressed as @xmath60 and their ratio is given by @xmath61 note that @xmath57 is regarded as the energy scale on the brane @xmath59 .",
    "now , we assume that the energy scale @xmath62 on the first brane is of the order of the planck scale , @xmath63 . and we assume also that our universe is on the second brane and therefore that @xmath64 ( the weak scale )",
    ". then , implies that @xmath65 which is neither too large nor too small . from now on ,",
    "we call the brane at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) `` the planck brane '' ( `` the tev brane '' ) .    to understand how the 4-dimensional hierarchy is naturally realized in the 5-dimensional theory , we need to drive the relation between the 4-dimensional planck mass @xmath9 and the 5-dimensional one @xmath24 . for this purpose , we add to the metric the following perturbation which does not depend on @xmath17 : . ] @xmath68 0\\ \\ & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{eq : squirtle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have chosen the rs gauge with @xmath69 then the 5-dimensional action ( without the cosmological constant term ) is reduced to @xmath70 where the 4-dimensional metric @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are made from @xmath75 and @xmath71 , respectively . from , we get the following relation between the 4-dimensional planck mass and the 5-dimensional one : @xmath76 note that we can neglect @xmath77 since we are taking @xmath78 .",
    "the relation is , for example , realized by taking @xmath79 in this case , all the 5-dimensional quantities , @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and @xmath15 , are approximately equal to @xmath9 , and this is a welcome result .",
    "thus , the 4-dimensional hierarchy @xmath80 is realized without introducing unnatural 5-dimensional hierarchies .    then , is the planck scale the unique 5-dimensional fundamental scale ?",
    "the answer is _",
    "no_. for example , let us adopt a new coordinate @xmath81 related to the original @xmath82 by the scale transformation @xmath83 the warp factor for the coordinate @xmath81 , @xmath84 is normalized at @xmath67 ( the tev brane position ) .",
    "since @xmath85 and @xmath86 are equal to @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , the 5-dimensional action is now given by @xmath89 this implies that the relation is modified to @xmath90 in this case , @xmath91 is realized by taking @xmath92 in which all the 5-dimensional quantities are approximately of the weak scale . in this way , we can arbitrarily change the energy scale of all the 5-dimensional quantities through the transformation . in the above two examples with the coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath81 , all the 5-dimensional quantities are of the scale of the brane at which the warp factor is normalized .",
    "since the extra dimension @xmath17 is compactified , there appear the towers of the kaluza - klein modes .",
    "we must verify the existence of the massless graviton corresponding to the zero - mode .",
    "we must also verify the non - existence of light massive modes which could affect the newton s law .",
    "let us consider the perturbation with @xmath93 now depending on @xmath17 as well as on @xmath82 . under the assumption that @xmath94 can be expanded as @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the 4-dimensional field with mass @xmath97 , the modes @xmath98 excluding the points @xmath99 are given by    [ eq : beedrill ] @xmath100",

    "note that the @xmath17 dependences of the @xmath107 term in cancel .",
    "the 4-dimensional mass @xmath97 and the ratio @xmath108 are determined by the boundary conditions at the brane positions .",
    "these conditions are derived by integrating the differential equation for @xmath98 in infinitesimal small regions containing the brane positions .",
    "we find that @xmath97 for the massive modes are determined by the following equation : @xmath109 for a very small @xmath97 with @xmath110 , . ]",
    "the first term of can be neglected , since we havelatexmath:[\\ ] ] however , this can not satisfy the boundary conditions except for the trivial case @xmath241 , implying that the tachyonic mode with @xmath238 does not exist .",
    "the same is expected to be true for other possible tachyonic modes .      in this last subsection",
    ", we discuss the importance of the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "as we saw in  3.1 , it came from the einstein equation as an integration constant .",
    "such a parameter can also appear in the rs model , though we did not consider it .",
    "if it is included , the solution @xmath124 is modified as @xmath242 and the warp factor @xmath243 as @xmath244 this implies that the parameter @xmath27 causes only a constant multiplication to the warp factor , which can be offset by a rescaling of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we do not need to consider the parameter @xmath27 in the rs model .    on the other hand , in our model",
    ", we can not offset the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath30 , @xmath245 is related to the hubble parameter @xmath26 . restoring @xmath26 and @xmath9 in ,",

    "hence , the non - zero @xmath27 keeps the model _",
    "sound_.      in the above discussion , there is no way to determine the sign of @xmath27 . in other words",
    ", we can carry out the analysis of the kaluza - klein modes for the both solutions of . for negative @xmath27 ,",
    "the warp factor @xmath243 has a zero at @xmath250 , namely , the 4-dimensional space - time shrinks to a point there . from the geodesic equation",
    ", we can show that particles go through this point .",
    "however , we can also show that the action of the fluctuation @xmath200 is divergent for negative @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , using for @xmath98 , we find that the quadratic part of the 4-dimensional fields @xmath96 in is multiplied by @xmath251 this integral is divergent at @xmath250 , since both @xmath252 and @xmath253 are divergent at @xmath250 .",
    "( the mode @xmath98 can be chosen to be real . )",
    "thus , we conclude that the negative @xmath27 case must be excluded , and , among the two candidates of , only @xmath254 is the acceptable one .      in  3.3.2",
