    "how big does an object have to be before quantum mechanical effects disappear ?",
    "a cat is presumably too large , but a molecule may not be . interference with @xmath0 molecules",
    "was demonstrated as early as 1930 @xcite , and there have been a number of subsequent experiments with small molecules @xcite . in a series of recent experiments , the group at the university of vienna has shown that molecules consisting of many atoms , such as fullerenes or fluorofullerenes can produce an interference pattern after travelling through a grating @xcite .",
    "molecules , however , come in many sizes , so one might expect that , in regard to their translational degrees of freedom , small molecules behave quantum mechanically while large ones do not . where is the boundary between these behaviors , and what causes the transition , if indeed it takes place ?",
    "there are several mechanisms that can destroy an interference pattern produced by matter waves .",
    "for example , a decoherence of molecule in a beam can be caused by to collisions with lighter particles from the environment ( see e.g. refs .",
    "other destructive environmental influences are grating vibrations , the finite size of a grating , or even coriolis forces ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . obviously , the chief destroyer of quantum coherences is thermal radiation through which the molecules become entangled with external ( light ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this mechanism , which leads to disappearance of the interference pattern , has been studied theoretically by several groups .",
    "the interference pattern found by the group in vienna disappears if the internal temperature of the molecules is sufficiently high ( 2000 k)@xcite .",
    "this experimental result has been analyzed in detail and theoretically explained by k. hornberger _",
    "in particular , these authors have studied the effect of thermal radiation at different temperatures of the molecule on the decoherence of fullerenes , taking into account that these molecules are not black body radiators . under this assumption",
    "they have been able to find a good agreement with experimental results .",
    "another possible source of decoherence is the coupling between the translational motion of the molecule and its internal states @xcite .",
    "the vibrational and rotational states of the molecule can be thought of as a reservoir that the molecule carries with it .",
    "when the molecule passes through a region in which there is a potential , the translational motion of the molecule and its internal modes can become entangled .",
    "therefore , the molecule s internal reservoir can cause different outgoing momenta or different paths the molecule can take through the region of nonzero potential to decohere .    here",
    "we wish to examine the effect of the internal states of the molecule on its interference .",
    "we shall do so by considering a simple model that is a version of two - slit interference , the most fundamental quantum mechanical interference phenomenon .",
    "our molecule will be a rigid rotator , consisting of two equal masses separated by a fixed distance , and , for simplicity , it will be confined to two dimensions .",
    "the molecule has both translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "it will scatter off of a potential , which will initially be taken to be one consisting of two peaks ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the molecule will interact with both parts of the potential , and the two scattered waves will both be incident on a detector at some distant point .",
    "the result of this process is described by the scattering cross section , and we shall be interested in whether or not it exhibits interference fringes . it is straightforward to extend our model to the case in which the potential has more than two peaks , in particular to the experimentally relevant situation in which it represents a diffraction grating , and interference pattern resulting from the scattering from this type of potential will be studied as well .",
    "entanglement between internal and translational states can , in fact , contribute to washing out an interference pattern , but only in certain parameter regimes .",
    "we shall examine two ways in which this can happen .",
    "the first is a result of the fact that after the scattering , different internal states of the molecule have different wave vectors describing their translational motion , i.e.  the outgoing momenta and the internal states of the molecule become entangled .",
    "for example , if the molecule is initially in a plane wave state of its translational motion and not rotating , and the outgoing state contains components that correspond to rotational motion of the molecule , then these components will have a wave vector whose magnitude is smaller than that of the original wave vector .",
    "this follows from energy conservation ; some of the translational kinetic energy has been transformed into rotational kinetic energy by the scattering .",
    "this mechanism was proposed by hegerfeldt and khler as a means of separating an excited state of a molecule from its ground state @xcite .",
    "molecules , which either have or have not been excited , pass through a transmission grating , and , because of the difference in their wave vectors , the ground and excited state molecules scatter in different directions . in our case",
    ", the different parts of the state of the scattered molecule , each part having a different wave vector , result in a total interference pattern made up of patterns with different spacings between their peaks , and this causes a smearing out of the overall pattern .",
    "the second way in which the pattern can be degraded comes into play if the potential is different in different regions , in particular if it consists of two peaks , which are not the same .",
    "then the path the molecule takes and its internal state can become entangled . if the internal states are sufficiently different , then they will reveal which path the molecule took , and there will be no interference pattern . our model will allow us to study both of these mechanisms .",
    "we calculate the cross section for our scattering in the born approximation , which we must modify to take into account the internal ( rotational ) states of the molecule .",
    "this calculation is relatively standard , so we have relegated it to an appendix .",
    "we begin the next section with the expression for the cross section , and proceed to analyze its implications .",

    "in addition , the classical path will be the most probable , so that the object will simply follow this path through the potential .",
    "there are clearly many gaps to be filled in before we can claim that this picture is correct .",
    "the calculations in this paper are a first step .",
    "more sophisticated models and treatments are called for . however",
    ", even this very simple model shows that internal states can act as a reservoir and cause different states of translational motion to decohere .",

    "here we calculate the cross section for the scattering of our molecule from a potential , to first order in the potential . if the initial state of the molecule is @xmath14 , and we want to find the amplitude to scatter into the state @xmath149 .",
    "to lowest order in the potential , the s - matrix element for this process is @xmath150 in order to find the scattering amplitude for a more general initial state , @xmath151 we simply multiply both sides of eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) by @xmath152 , integrate over @xmath15 , and sum over @xmath16 .    in order to find the cross section",
    ", we shall follow the treatment in reference @xcite .",
    "the scattered wave function , @xmath153 is given by @xmath154 if @xmath8 is a unit vector in the @xmath155 direction , then the probability of the particle scattering in the @xmath8 direction , @xmath156 is @xmath157 substituting eq .",

    "now let us consider an incoming beam of particles that scatter off of the potential .",
    "the particles are in wave packets @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is highly localized about @xmath162 .",
    "the incoming beam is of width @xmath163 , so that the center of the wave packets can be displaced in the @xmath3 direction anywhere between @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , we consider incoming wave functions of the form @xmath165 where @xmath164 . consequently , we replace @xmath166 in eq .",
    "( [ p(u ) ] ) by the above expression , and then average the result over @xmath3 , i.e.  we find @xmath167 . now @xmath168 is just the length of the part of the incoming beam that scatters in the direction @xmath8 , and this is just the cross section , @xmath169 .",
    "we , therefore , have @xmath170 assuming the scattering center is much smaller than the beam width , we can take the limit @xmath171 in this equation , which introduces a @xmath172 into the integrals appearing in eq .",

    "then the effect of doing the @xmath184 integral is simply to set @xmath185 in the integrand .",
    "the result is @xmath186 we only get a substantial contribution to the remaining integral when @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "note that this implies that only the @xmath189 in the sum over @xmath189 and @xmath190 contributes .",
    "these two conditions imply that @xmath191 , which further implies that @xmath192 . doing the @xmath193 integral , then , has the effect of setting @xmath194 and @xmath192 in the integrand , and the result is eq .",
