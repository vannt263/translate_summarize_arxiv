    "in the recent years , many initiatives have been started in order to perform optical astronomical surveys in the time domain . some of the projects intend to focus on a few specific discipline , e.g. the _ kepler _ mission ( on exoplanetary and asteroseismology research , see e.g. borucki et al .  2007 ) or cover dozens of independent scientific key projects , such as the pan - starrs ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) or the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , ivezi et al .",
    "these surveys attain their success due to the extreme light collecting power or _",
    "tendue _ , which is the multiple of the net aperture area and the effective field - of - view of the imaging optics ( basically a measure of light collecting power ) .",
    "the aforementioned projects perform observations by either covering a smaller celestial area with frequent sampling ( such as _ kepler _ ) or a larger areas with sparser sampling ( pan - starss or lsst ) , however , all of these deal with high imaging resolution .",
    "the goal of the fly s eye project is do develop , and operate a high coverage , high cadence , but lower imaging resolution instrumentation with a comparable tendue to the previously mentioned projects the scientific goals of our project also cover dozens of astrophysical phenomena , as it is described in pl et al .",
    "our expectation is to achieve photometric precision in the millimagnitude level for stars with a brightness of sloan @xmath2 as well as a faint depth of @xmath3 with s / n of 5 or more for isolated objects .",
    "the high coverage and high cadence is attained by observing the visible sky simultaneously using numerous wide - field cameras ( similarly to deeg et al .",
    "2004 or pepper et al .",
    "although the imaging resolution is essentially low ( @xmath4 ) , even high cadence images require precise sidereal tracking during the exposures . in our design",
    ", this tracking is achieved by a hexapod mount ( also known as steward - platform ) , which has many advantages due to conventional bi - axis mechanisms , including the lack of proper adjustment and the usability of the same instrument independently from the geographical location . in this paper",
    "we briefly summarize the key concepts of the hexapod itself as well as the results of our first tests related to the sidereal tracking .",
    "due to its complexity , hexapods are barely involved as a primary mount in astrophysical applications .",
    "mainly , these are used as a support for secondary mirrors ( see e.g. geijo et al .  2006 ) , and there are direct applications in the field of radio astronomy ( koch et al . 2009 ) as well as optical spectroscopy ( chini 2000 ) . since with the exception of the fly s eye initiative , there is no direct application for optical imaging , in this section , we summarize the key concepts of our hexapod design .

    "+ + + + + + + + + +    as its name suggests , our hexapod involves six identical linear actuators with two universal joints mounted at both ends .",
    "our choice of electromechanical actuators exploit a jack screw in order to transform rotary motion into linear one .",
    "the total stroke of our actuator is limited to @xmath5 while the net length of a single leg in `` home position '' is approximately @xmath6 .",
    "the net length is defined as the distance between the two corresponding universal joint center points while the `` home position '' is defined at halfway between the fully retracted and full stroke state .",
    "magnetomechanical switches ensure the proper limiting of each actuator while the position feedback is done by a hall effect based rotary encoder having a resolution equivalent to @xmath7 stroke .",
    "both on the base and the payload platform , the universal joints are mounted to a triangle - shaped structure whose side is approximately @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the characteristic instrument size and the actuator travel length ( @xmath5 ) yield us approximately @xmath9 of rotary domain of the hexapod , that is sufficient for more than an hour of sidereal tracking . the cad view as well as the complete hexapod ( with a camera and optics at the current state ) can be seen in fig .",

    "the core of each board is an avr architecture microcontroller with identical firmwares .",
    "the real - time code multiplexes the communication with the control bus ( see below ) , the motor driver circuit and the position encoder .    [",

    "this bus system allows a complete synchronized operation : the leg movement parameters ( duration , stroke / retract , higher order polynomial coefficients etc . )",
    "are uploaded in a unicast manner to each leg while the `` start '' command is a broadcast message . during motion",
    ", the status of the legs can be polled directly .",
    "although rs485 lets distant parts to be connected , this bus is also driven locally by a single - board computer ( sbc ) which serializes commands received on tcp / ip to the rs485 bus .",

    "the electric lens focusing is realized via an spi ( serial peripheral interface ) bus , also hosted on a rs485 node , connected to the same bus .",
    "hence , the traffic of the whole device , including the camera , filter , hexapod mount control , as well as other housekeeping sensors ( humidity , temperature , etc . )",
    "are tunnelled via multiple tcp / ip channels .",
    "the data acquisition could therefore be controlled by any machine connected to the internet . in our tests , while the device was located at piszkstet station , in most of the time , data acquisition was managed by a computer located at budapest .",
    "during our first test runs , we acquired more than 4,000 individual frames in a filter sequence of g-r-i-r. for simplicity , the subsequent data acquisition steps ( hexapod repositioning between exposures , filter changing , focusing , readout ) were not done in parallel , hence the duty cycle is currently somewhat smaller than our final goal ( 70% instead of 90%+ ) .",

    "properly the actuator stroke speeds using this 3 combinations , one is able to attain proper sidereal tracking with the hexapod . as a self - calibration procedure , we gathered 4 series of subsequent image pairs in order to obtain the numerical derivative of the field centroid coordinates with respect to the pitch , roll and yaw speed offsets .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the device is exactly aligned to the compass points and to the horizon . for this analysis",
    ", we employed the tasks of the fitsh package ( pl , 2012 ) .",
    "since the hexapod geometry ( determined by the universal joint center positions ) is known with a significantly better relative accuracy ( @xmath15 , assuming an assembly precision of @xmath16 ) than the alignment ( @xmath17 ) , we could set up a set of equations by saying that 1 ) the rotation speed must be equal to the sidereal and 2 + 3 ) the apparent drift of the centroid ( on the ccd plane ) must be zero . by solving these 3 equations , we could determine the offsets that should be added to the pitch , roll and yaw speeds .",
    "our initial results show that despite of its simplicity , the above procedure yields indeed proper sidereal tracking on the time scale of few minutes , even considering that actuator stroke speeds are constants on the timescale of exposures .",
    "we performed these tests not only with the @xmath11 lens but also with a catadioptric optics of @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , see also fig .",

    "the latter tests yielded a tracking drift of @xmath21 ( see left four panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : stamps ] ) which is equivalent to a relative error of @xmath22 .",
    "this value is well comparable to the _ a priori _ assumption of the assembly precision .    as it is discussed in pl et al .",

    ", we could reliably characterize the repeatability of the instrument since the hexapod performs hundreds of independent movements between two respective frames .",
    "we found that this repeatability is in the level of some tenths of pixels using the @xmath11 optics , that is in the range of a few arcseconds .",
    "this paper described the first results of the fly s eye project related to the sidereal tracking as it is performed with a hexapod mount . despite of the very simple tracking algorithm and self - calibration procedure",
    ", we found that the precision is well beyond within a magnitude than our needs , justifying that the hexapod is an adequate mount for such an optical imaging instrument .",
