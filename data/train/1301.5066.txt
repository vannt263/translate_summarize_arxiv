    "x - ray radiation has been , ever since its discovery over a century ago , one of the most effective tools to explore the properties of matter for a broad range of scientific research .",
    "successive generations of radiation sources have been developed providing radiation with always higher brightness , shorter wavelength and shorter pulse duration @xcite . despite remarkable progress on x - ray generation methods , there is still a need for light sources delivering femtosecond pulses of bright high - energy x - ray and gamma - ray radiation , emitted from source size of the order of a micron @xcite .",
    "indeed , the intense activity on the production of such radiation is motivated by countless applications in fundamental science , industry or medicine.@xcite . for example , in the studies of structural dynamics of matter , the ultimate time scale of the vibrational period of atoms is a few tens of femtoseconds .",
    "fundamental processes such as dissociation , isomerization , phonons , and charge transfer evolve at this time scale .",
    "high - energy radiation is used to radiograph dense objects that are opaque for low - energy x rays , while micron source size allows one to obtain high - resolution images and makes possible phase contrast imaging to see what is invisible with absorption radiography .",
    "several techniques are being developed to produce femtosecond x rays . in the accelerator community , large - scale free - electron laser facilities can now deliver the brightest x - ray beams ever , with unprecedented novel possibilities @xcite .",
    "the slicing technique , combining a conventional accelerator with a femtosecond laser to isolate short electron slices , allows synchrotrons to produce radiation pulses with duration of the order of 100 fs @xcite .",
    "high - energy radiation can be delivered by radioactive sources , x - ray tube , and compton scattering sources based on a conventional accelerator . however , even if widely used these high - energy radiation sources have limitations in terms of storage , pulse duration , spectrum tunability , energy range , and source size .    in parallel , alternative and complementary methods based on laser - produced plasmas have been developed to produce ultrashort compact radiation sources covering a wide spectral range from the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) to the gamma rays . while several laser - based source schemes were proposed in the early 1970s , this field of research has seen rapid development when lasers have been able to produce intense femtosecond pulses @xcite . at laser intensities on the order of @xmath0 w/@xmath1 , xuv radiation , in the few tens of electronvolts ( ev ) energy range , can be produced using the mechanism of high - order harmonics generation from gas targets @xcite or by xuv laser amplification in a laser - produced plasma @xcite .",

    "relativistic effects become significant .",
    "electrons can be accelerated within the laser field or in the wakefield of the laser up to relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "in particular , laser wakefield acceleration has led to the production of high - quality femtosecond relativistic electron bunches @xcite created and accelerated up to the gigaelectronvolt level @xcite within only a few millimeters or centimeters plasma . using these relativistic electrons ,",
    "several novel x - ray source schemes have been proposed over the past decades to produce collimated and femtosecond radiation in a spectrum ranging from the soft x rays to gamma rays .",
    "most of these schemes are based on the wiggling of relativistic electrons accelerated in a laser wakefield . in this article , the physics of these sources is reviewed , and the opportunities offered by these relativistic electrons to generate ultrashort x - ray radiation @xcite are highlighted .",
    "these sources can deliver x rays or gamma rays as short as a few femtoseconds , as they inherit the temporal profile of the laser - plasma electron bunch , whose few - femtosecond duration was recently experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",

    "the relevant parameters describing the properties of the radiation , such as its spectrum , divergence , number of emitted photons and duration , can be extracted . as the x - ray sources presented here",
    "are based on electrons accelerated by laser wakefields [ _ i.e. _ , by the laser wakefield accelerator ( lwfa ) ] , a description of the most efficient laser - based electron accelerator to date is given in sec .",

    "[ chap4 ] , [ chap5 ] and [ chap6 ] , different methods for the production of incoherent x rays from relativistic electrons are reviewed ; the objective is to define the relevant regimes to accelerate and wiggle electrons in such a way that they emit x rays . in sec .",
    "[ chap4 ] , betatron radiation is described . in that case , a plasma cavity created in the wake of an intense laser pulse acts as both an electron accelerator and a wiggler ( referred to as a plasma undulator ) .",
    "the scheme presented in sec .",
    "[ chap5 ] relies on the use of laser wakefield accelerated electrons , transported and wiggled in a meter - scale periodic arrangement of permanent magnets ( conventional undulator ) .",
    "this method is the closest to synchrotron technology . in sec .",
    "[ chap6 ] , the nonlinear thomson scattering and the thomson backscattering sources are reviewed . in nonlinear thomson scattering , electrons are directly accelerated and wiggled in an intense laser field .",
    "for the thomson backscattering case , the plasma is used to accelerate electrons which are then wiggled in a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave ( em undulator ) .    in sec .",
    "[ chap7 ] , an introduction to the topic of the free - electron laser is given and the conditions for realizing such an ultrahigh - brightness and coherent source of radiation with wavelength down to the angstrom ( hard x rays ) from laser - accelerated electrons are discussed for different types of undulators ( plasma , conventional , and em ) .",
    "other radiation sources based on the laser - plasma interaction have been developed and could provide photons in the kev range .",
    "for example , high - order harmonics from gas @xcite or solid targets @xcite , sources based on the flying mirror concept @xcite , or the @xmath3 source @xcite can produce femtosecond xuv or x - ray radiation .",
    "however , they are not based on the same physical principle of acceleration and wiggling of relativistic electrons , and will therefore not be reviewed here .",
    "in this section , the radiation from relativistic electrons is introduced .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the phenomenon is highlighted and analytical results for the relevant general parameters determining the radiation features are given .",
    "the formalism described here is general and will be common to all the sources presented throughout the article .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and provide the basic results necessary for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a complete and detailed description of synchrotron radiation from bending magnets , undulator , and wiggler insertion devices ( e.g. for the angular distribution of individual undulator harmonics , for polarization or spatial and temporal coherence properties ) .",
    "relativistic electrons can produce bright x - ray beams if their motion is appropriately driven .",
    "for all the laser - based x - ray sources discussed in this article , the radiation mechanism is the emission from accelerated relativistic electrons .",
    "the features of this relativistically moving charge radiation are directly linked to the electron trajectories .",
    "obtained from the linard - wiechert field , the general expression that gives the radiation emitted by an electron , in the direction of observation @xmath6 , as a function of its position , velocity , and acceleration along the trajectory is written @xcite @xmath7 } \\frac{\\vec{n } \\times \\left [ ( \\vec{n}-\\vec{\\beta } ) \\times \\dot{\\vec{\\beta } } \\right ] } { ( 1-\\vec{\\beta}.\\vec{n})^2 } dt \\right    \\end{split}\\ ] ] this equation represents the energy radiated within a spectral band @xmath8 centered on the frequency @xmath9 and a solid angle @xmath10 centered on the direction of observation @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the electron position at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the velocity of the electron normalized to the speed of light @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the usual acceleration divided by @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that this expression assumes an observer placed at a distance far from the electron so that the unit vector @xmath6 is constant along the trajectory . the expression ( [ chap2eq1 ] ) for the radiated energy shows an important number of generic features :    1 .",
    "when @xmath16 , no radiation is emitted by the electron .",
    "this means that the acceleration is responsible for the emission of electromagnetic waves from charged particles .",
    "2 .   according to the term @xmath17 , the radiated energy is maximum when @xmath18 .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , a relativistic electron ( @xmath21 ) will radiate orders of magnitude higher than a nonrelativistic electron , and its radiation will be directed along the direction of its velocity .",
    "this is simply the consequence of the lorentz transformation : for an electron emitting an isotropic radiation in its rest frame , the lorentz transformation implies that the radiation is highly collimated in the small cone of typical opening angle of @xmath22 around the electron velocity vector , when observed in the laboratory frame ( see fig .",
    "[ chap2fig1 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider ultrarelativistic electrons , @xmath23 , and all angles which will be defined are supposed to be small so that @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath25 , together with the relation @xmath26 and @xmath27 between applied force and acceleration ( respectively for a force longitudinal or transverse with respect to the velocity @xmath13 ) , indicate that applying a transverse force @xmath28 is more efficient than a longitudinal force .",
    "the term also shows that the radiated energy increases with the square of the acceleration @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radiated power .",
    "thus , it is much more efficient to use a transverse force in order to obtain high radiated energy .",
    "4 .   the phase term @xmath33}$ ] can be locally approximated by @xmath34 .",
    "the integration over time will give a nonzero result only when the integrand , excluding the exponential , varies approximately at the same frequency as the phase term which oscillates at @xmath35 .",
    "given that the velocity @xmath13 of the electron varies at the frequency @xmath36 , the condition @xmath37 is required to have a nonzero result .",
    "the electron will radiate at the higher frequency @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the usual doppler upshift is directly extracted from this general formula .",
    "this indicates the possibility to produce x - ray beams ( @xmath39 ) by wiggling a relativistic directional electron beam at a frequency far below the x - ray range : @xmath40 .    this analysis underlines the directions for the production of x rays from relativistic electrons : the goal for x - ray generation from relativistic electrons is to force a relativistic electron beam to oscillate transversally",
    "this transverse motion will be responsible for the radiation .",
    "this is the principle of synchrotron facilities , where a periodic static magnetic field , created by a succession of magnets , is used to induce a transverse motion to the electrons .",
    "the laser - based sources presented here rely on this principle . in the next sections ,",
    "the properties of moving charge radiation in two different regimes are reviewed .",
    "the different laser - based x - ray sources which will be discussed can work in both regimes depending on the interaction parameters .",
    "we consider ultrarelativistic electrons with a velocity along the direction @xmath41 executing transverse oscillations in the @xmath42 direction .",
    "two regimes can be distinguished .",
    "the undulator regime corresponds to the situation where an electron radiates in the same direction at all times along its motion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chap2fig1 ] .",
    "this occurs when the maximal angle of the trajectory @xmath43 is smaller than the opening angle of the radiation cone @xmath22 .",
    "the wiggler regime differs from the undulator by the fact that the different sections of the trajectory radiate in different directions .",
    "thus , emissions from the different sections are spatially decoupled .",
    "this occurs when @xmath44 .",
    "the fundamental dimensionless parameter separating these two regimes is @xmath45 .",
    "the radiation produced in these two regimes have different qualitative and quantitative properties in terms of spectrum , divergence , and radiated energy and number of emitted photons .",
    "is the maximum angle between the electron velocity and the propagation axis @xmath41 and @xmath46 is the opening angle of the radiation cone .",
    "when @xmath47 ( undulator ) , the electron always radiates in the same direction along the trajectory , whereas when @xmath48 ( wiggler ) , the electron radiates toward different directions in each portion of the trajectory.,width=321 ]      the shape of the radiation spectrum can be determined using simple qualitative arguments . in",
    "most of the cases discussed throughout the article the electron trajectory can be approximated by a simple transverse sinusoidal oscillation of period @xmath49 at a constant velocity @xmath50 and constant @xmath51 .",
    "the orbit can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the wave - vector norm , @xmath54 is the transverse amplitude of motion , and @xmath43 is the maximum angle between the electron velocity and the longitudinal direction @xmath41 .",
    "since the electron energy is constant , an increase of the transverse velocity leads to a decrease of the longitudinal velocity .",
    "this can be explicitly derived from the assumed trajectory ( [ chap2eq2 ] ) , @xmath55    with the trajectory of the electron periodic , the emitted radiation is also periodic since each time the electron is in the same acceleration state , the radiated amplitude is identical .",
    "the period of the radiated field can be calculated to obtain the fundamental frequency of the radiation spectrum .",
    "the radiation emitted in the direction @xmath6 , forming an angle @xmath56 with the @xmath41 direction , is considered , as represented in fig .

    "the parameter @xmath92 can be considered as the number of decoupled sections of the trajectory . with each section radiating toward a different direction , the radiation is spatially decoupled and",
    "leads to bursts of duration @xmath74 in each direction and to a broad spectrum with harmonics of the fundamental up to @xmath85 .",

    "have been considered in order to simply discuss the effect of summation of the radiation from each electron . however , in realistic bunches , electrons have slightly different energies and momenta . more precisely ,",
    "inside the bunch , electrons that are at the same location can have different energies and momenta .",
    "this implies , for example , that the bunch can not be focused and compressed on an infinitely small point .",
    "this limitation is fundamental and inherent to the bunch , it does not depend on practical realization .",
    "the parameter which accounts for that is called the emittance and is related to the volume occupied by the electrons in the 6d phase space @xmath173 at a given time @xcite .",
    "the 6d phase volume is constant in time if only smooth external forces are applied and if collisions are neglected ( the phase volume conservation is a consequence of the collisionless boltzmann equation ) .",
    "the emittance reflects the quality of the electron beam because it quantitatively indicates if electrons have the same coordinates , direction , and energy .    for a relativistic electron beam traveling in the @xmath41 direction ,",

    "the electron beam is focused in the device , with a transverse size @xmath197 and a divergence @xmath56 satisfying @xmath198 . because of the angular spread , the radiation angular distributions from each single electron are slightly shifted from one another , leading to a redshifted broadening of harmonic bandwidths [ an electron with direction @xmath56 with respect to the propagation axis contributes on axis with higher wavelength @xmath199 , see eq .",

    "the possibility to accelerate electrons in laser - produced plasmas was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "they suggested to use the intense electric field of a relativistic plasma wave , created in the wake of an intense laser pulse , to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "the main advantage of plasmas relies on their ability to sustain an accelerating gradient much larger ( on the order of 100 gev / m ) than a conventional radio frequency accelerating module ( on the order of 10 mev / m ) .",
    "this means that electrons could be accelerated up to 1 gev in millimeter- or centimeter - scale plasmas @xcite while a few tens of meters would be necessary to reach the same energy in conventional accelerators .",
    "this acceleration method has experienced a remarkable development over the past decades , mainly thanks to the advent of high - intensity lasers and to a better understanding of the physical mechanisms driving the acceleration .",
    "different plasma accelerator schemes have been developed over the years , leading to electron bunches with ever - increasing quality .",

    "this slow drift motion of the plasma electrons leads to a charge density distribution @xmath76 responsible for a coulomb force @xmath208 ( by virtue of the poisson equation @xmath215 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a small charge density perturbation in a plasma oscillates at a characteristic frequency , the plasma frequency @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the electron density of the plasma .",
    "for example , if we translate an electron slice ( continuously , without crossing between different electrons ) from its initial position , the slice will oscillate around its initial position at the plasma frequency because of the restoring coulomb force from the plasma ions .",
    "these plasma oscillations , called plasma waves , are excited by the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse , which creates the initial charge density perturbation .",
    "the phase velocity of the plasma wave @xmath218 , excited in the wake of the laser pulse , is approximately equal to the laser group velocity .    for a low - intensity laser pulse , with a normalized vector potential amplitude @xmath219 ,",

    "in addition , the laser intensity must be sufficiently high ( @xmath229 ) to expel most of the electrons out of the focal spot .",

    "several techniques have been explored to produce plasma waves appropriate to accelerate electrons .",
    "a typical experiment for laser - plasma acceleration consists in focusing a laser pulse into a gas jet , the interaction parameters being essentially the laser intensity , focal spot size and duration , the propagation length , and the plasma density .",
    "depending on the choice of these parameters the features of the produced electron bunch can be very different .",
    "prior to 2004 , experiments used relatively high plasma densities ( @xmath237 @xmath238 ) and the produced electron bunches were characterized by broadband spectra , extending up to about 100 mev .",
    "these spectra were either nearly maxwellian in the direct laser acceleration ( dla ) regime @xcite or non - maxwellian in the self - modulated laser wakefield accelerator ( sm - lwfa ) and forced laser wakefield ( flwf ) regimes @xcite .",
    "in 2004 , major advances were made by setting the laser pulse duration close to the plasma period , increasing the interaction length and matching the dephasing to the propagation length .",
    "three groups reported simultaneously on the production of monoenergetic electrons in the 100 mev range @xcite , collimated within a few milliradians and with charge on the order of 100 pc .",
    "however , despite these remarkable progresses , the high nonlinearity of the mechanism resulted in electron bunches which were neither stable nor tunable in energy ; in addition electron energies remained below the gev level .    to overcome these limitations , improved schemes",

    "an external and controlled electron injection into the wakefield was proposed @xcite and recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it consists of colliding the main laser pulse generating the plasma wave with a second laser pulse , creating a beat wave whose ponderomotive force can preaccelerate and locally inject background electrons in the wakefield @xcite .",

    "a collimated beam of x - ray radiation is emitted by the electron bunch .",

    "this scheme remains a feasibility study since it requires an electron bunch quality which has not been achieved yet .",

    "in this section , the topic of free - electron laser ( fel ) is introduced , especially in the xuv to x - ray range , and we discuss the perspectives to get fel light from laser - accelerated electron bunches .",
    "the free - electron laser concept was first proposed by @xcite who , having experience with insertion devices ( undulators and wigglers ) for light sources , realized that a laserlike amplifier could be constructed by combining a high - quality electron beam with an undulator or wiggler and an input radiation beam .",
    "a few years later , the principle was demonstrated experimentally by madey and co - workers @xcite .    the electron beam inside the undulator acts as an active medium and provides the amplification of the radiation beam .",
    "the undulator is the coupling component , which permits energy exchange between the radiation and electrons . in practice , injecting an electron beam in an undulator will naturally lead to incoherent synchrotron emission , as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "this incoherent emission provides the input radiation beam and can be amplified by the fel process when certain conditions are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "the mechanism can be explained as follows . a single electron experiences the radiation from other electrons in the bunch .",
    "this interaction between the bunch and its own radiation can lead to a microbunching of the electron distribution within the bunch at the fundamental wavelength of the radiation and its harmonics .",
    "this microbunching in return leads to coherent emission from the overall electron bunch , whose power is orders of magnitude higher than the usual incoherent synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , this free - electron laser mechanism requires restrictive conditions on the electron beam quality and an important number @xmath93 of oscillations to take place .",
    "this situation , where the incoherent synchrotron or spontaneous emission is amplified in a single pass , is commonly named the self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) configuration , and brings a fluctuating radiation output ( shot to shot ) with poor temporal coherence . in the opposite way , injecting in the undulator an input coherent radiation beam , _",
    "i.e. _ , an external seeding beam , gives a stable radiation output with good temporal coherence",
    ". nevertheless , the latter case requires a coherent source at a given radiation wavelength with a power higher than the synchrotron one @xcite , and such coherent sources are not yet available in the x - ray domain .",
    "hence , the sase configuration seems to be the simplest route toward the production of hard x rays .    many projects with a compact free - electron laser in the x - ray range of the spectrum (",
    "x - fel ) and operating fel facilities are based on the sase approach .",
    "the first facility which has provided sase radiation in the soft x - ray domain is the free - electron laser at hamburg ( flash ) which is currently working at wavelengths down to @xmath720 nm @xcite .",
    "the linac coherent light source @xcite and the spring-8 angstrom compact free - electron laser @xcite have demonstrated fel saturation at angstrom wavelengths , while the european x - ray free - electron laser @xcite is under preparation . on the other hand ,",
    "seeded free - electron lasers are considered to improve the beam quality [ for example , seeded flash ( sflash ) and fermi@elettra @xcite ] , but they generally aim to less energetic photons ( soft x rays ) .    for our purposes ,",
    "the electron beam is generated using a laser - plasma accelerator and the undulator can be a conventional meter - scale undulator ( see sec .",
    "[ chap5 ] ) , an electromagnetic wave undulator ( see sec . [ chap6 ] ) , or the plasma undulator of the blowout regime ( see sec .",
    "[ chap4 ] ) .",
    "this latter differs significantly from the others because the strength parameter of the undulator depends on the amplitude of the betatron oscillation and on the electron energy .",

    "finally , the required conditions for the fel amplification are used to investigate its feasibility from laser - accelerated electron bunches for three specific cases of undulator : the conventional one , the electromagnetic wave one , and the icl one .",
    "we focus especially on the conventional undulator , since it represents the most promising route for near - future developments toward a compact x - ray free - electron laser .        to understand the physical mechanism of fel amplification , it is instructive to begin by the interaction of a single electron with the radiation beam and the undulator @xcite . in the following ,",

    "superradiance , as defined by @xcite , is a spontaneous emission from a coherently prepared system , whose energy scales as the square of the number of electrons .",
    "fel superradiance is slightly different , because electrons begin to bunch when interacting with the spontaneous emission and evolve toward a coherently prepared system .",
    "the radiation energy of the weak superradiance regime then scales as @xmath136 instead of the @xmath777 steady - state dependence , but is much lower than the steady - state radiation energy .",
    "in contrast , for long electron bunches , strong superradiance can occur if the weak superradiance radiation emitted by the trailing edge of the bunch propagates and slips through the overall bunch and is subsequently amplified . in that case",
    ", the peak power is much greater than the steady - state saturation value .",
    "the notion of cooperation length also indicates that the condition on the energy spread does not have to be applied on the overall electron bunch .",
    "it is sufficient that each sub - bunch of length @xmath791 has an energy spread smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "the energy spread calculated within a cooperation length is called the slice energy spread . the condition ( [ chap7eq7 ] ) is relaxed and replaced by @xmath793 requiring transverse emittance",
    "can also be replaced with the same conditions applying slice transverse emittance , defined in the same way as slice energy spread .    _",
    "d. space - charge effects _ another effect which influences the fel performance is space charge .",
    "when the fel amplification process tends to microbunch the electron beam at the radiation wavelength , longitudinal space - charge forces , on the contrary , tend to debunch the beam . the inverse plasma frequency @xmath794 ( time scale of plasma oscillations ) can indicate over which distance debunching occurs , while the gain length characterizes the distance over which bunching forces are significant . in the electron rest frame ,",
    "the longitudinal distance is @xmath51 times higher than in the laboratory frame , so the density is divided by @xmath51 and the plasma frequency by @xmath795 .",
    "hence plasma oscillations take place on a time scale @xmath796 in the rest frame , and because of time dilatation , they take place on a time scale @xmath797 in the laboratory frame , corresponding to a covered distance of @xmath798 .",
    "longitudinal space - charge forces are then negligible when @xmath799 where @xmath216 is the plasma frequency without any relativistic correction .",
    "+ transverse space - charge forces can also influence the fel performance . in the envelope equation for the electron beam , the focusing field , emittance term , and the space - charge term appeared . to neglect transverse space - charge forces ,",
    "the corresponding term in the envelope equation has to be small compared to the other terms , _",
    "i.e. _ , the focusing one and the emittance one @xcite .    _",
    "e. undulator errors and wakefields _ the practical realization of a free - electron laser consists in many undulator sections and transport devices .",
    "the magnetic field of undulators has small errors and sections can be slightly misaligned , resulting in a degradation of the fel performance .",
    "in addition , a high - current electron beam propagating between the two resistive walls of small - gap undulators induces a wakefield which can modify the beam properties along the propagation , altering the fel process .",
    "see @xcite for a description of these effects .    _",
    "f. quantum fel _ the fel process described above is based on a classical treatment , so it is relevant to ensure that quantum phenomena are unimportant by determining the limit for which the dynamics is effectively described by classical mechanics .",
    "the fel dynamics becomes quantum if the momentum recoils @xmath800 of an electron emitting a photon of wave vector @xmath801 is greater than the fel bandwidth @xmath802 , _",
    "i.e _ , if the electron becomes off - resonance after emitting a photon .",
    "hence , in a quantum fel , each electron radiates only one photon . in all realizable cases ,",
    "@xmath803 and quantum effects are completely negligible so that the classical fel theory correctly describes the process .    to conclude",
    ", we emphasize that 1d formulas are useful for simple estimations , and ming xie formulas @xcite for corrections due to energy spread , diffraction , and emittance . for quantitative study of a given configuration and for time - dependent effects and space - charge force effects ,",
    "self - consistent , 3d , and time - dependent codes such as genesis can be used @xcite .      in the above description of the fel amplification process",
    "we did not discuss where the input radiation field came from .",
    "the fel radiation can be started either by an initial seeding field or by a random modulation of the electron beam ( sase regime ) .",
    "the above description of the fel amplification process directly applies to the seeding case .",
    "this case provides high - quality output radiation , but requires that a relatively intense coherent radiation field at the given wavelength @xmath63 can already be generated , which is not the case for high - energy photons as x rays . in principle , high - order harmonics ( hhg ) generated in gas allow one to seed fel up to the extreme ultraviolet part of the spectrum at the present state of the art .",
    "a recent experiment has demonstrated the fel amplification of a seeding beam at 160 nm by 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these schemes , and , in particular , hhg on solid targets @xcite , could be extended to x - ray photons in the near future and could provide a seed for x - fel . however , the seeding power has to be higher than the power of the incoherent synchrotron or spontaneous emission @xcite , and this latter is proportional to the desired photon energy .",
    "this means that it will be more and more difficult to have a suitable seeding beam for smaller radiation wavelength and higher photon energy because the required power will be higher .",
    "the case of an initially randomly modulated electron beam ( sase configuration ) is different and the theoretical description is more complex .",
    "no radiation input enters with the electron beam inside the undulator . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ chap2secf ] , electrons inside bunches delivered by conventional or laser - plasma accelerators are randomly distributed in space . whereas if the electron distribution in space is uniform no radiation is emitted , for a random one , incoherent radiation is emitted ( synchrotron radiation , whose power is proportional to the number of electrons ) and this incoherent radiation provides a seed for the fel amplification process .",
    "moreover , the incoherent radiation is emitted at the wavelength given by eq .",
    "( [ chap7eq4 ] ) , and therefore the resonance condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "the main advantage of this method is straightforward : it allows one to extend fel radiation to high - energy photons because no external coherent radiation is needed . a major experiment demonstrating self - amplified spontaneous emission gain , exponential growth , and saturation",
    "was achieved by @xcite and highlighted the possibility to develop an operational x - fel . nowadays ,",
    "most of the x - fel projects ( @xmath804 nm ) are based on this approach . however , because the input is a fluctuating quantity shot to shot , the quality of the output radiation is very low compared to the seeding case , in which the output inherits the quality of the external input . for the sase case",
    ", the output power has very large fluctuations and very poor temporal coherence .",
    "the temporal profile and the spectrum are constituted of many spikes ; the spikes of the temporal profile have typical durations of @xmath805 while the spikes of the spectrum have typical relative width of @xmath806 , where @xmath807 is the bunch length ( the fel process smooths the parameters of the electron beam and the radiation over the scale of the cooperation length ) .      from the different required conditions on the electron beam parameters ( see sec . [ chap7secasec2 ] ) , the feasibility of a fel from a laser - plasma accelerator can be investigated for each specific undulator or wiggler type . the above results which are strictly valid for the conventional undulator give only good estimations for the other ones [ for example , see @xcite for the comparison between electromagnetic wave and conventional undulators ] .",
    "conventional undulators have typically centimeter period and strength parameter of unity .",
    "hence , according to the resonance condition ( [ chap7eq4 ] ) , using electron bunches at the 100 mev level , the fel radiation wavelength is in the uv to xuv range , whereas at the 1 gev level it reaches the soft x - ray and hard x - ray ranges . in the following ,",
    "we consider two different scenarios , x - fel 1 and 2 , which are speculative and can be seen as future perspectives in the short term and long term , respectively , of laser - plasma accelerators .",
    "all input parameters of these scenarios and the corresponding output fel parameters are given in table [ chap7tab1 ] .",
    "table [ chap7tab1 ] contains the results obtained by 3d time - dependent genesis simulations in the sase configuration .",
    "the choice of the electron beam parameters is motivated by extension of the 100 mev range state - of - the - art laser - plasma accelerator performance to higher electron energies .",
    "the electron beam peak current is maintained constant when going to higher electron energies because the requirement of small energy spread imposes an optimized beam loading which flattens the accelerating electric field along the bunch @xcite .",
    "the optimized peak current scales as the normalized vector potential @xmath211 of the laser pulse and is independent of the electron density of the plasma @xmath217 . because the electron accelerator efficiency scales as @xmath808 , @xmath211 , and therefore the electron beam peak current ,",
    "should not be increased when designing a higher energy laser - plasma accelerator . the absolute energy spread and",
    "the normalized emittance can remain constant in the acceleration process if beam loading is optimized and if quasistationary forces are applied to the electron beam .",
    "therefore , in principle , the low absolute energy spread ( a few mev ) @xcite and normalized emittance @xmath809 @xcite achievable for electrons at the 100 mev range could also be obtained at 1 and 5 gev .",
    "note that the bunch rms transverse size @xmath197 is experimentally chosen by the transport configuration .",
    "of course , this choice determines the rms angular spread @xmath810 . in order to have the pierce parameter as high as possible",

    "third , the electron bunch transport from the plasma source to the undulator is specific : even if the emittance is comparable to that of conventional accelerators , at the exit of the plasma , the transverse size is very small ( a few microns ) when the divergence is higher ( a few milliradians ) .",

    "chromatic aberrations of quadrupoles ( which are proportional to the electron beam energy spread ) are large , leading to an enormous growth of emittance , and because electrons cover different distances , the longitudinal bunch length also grows .",

    "additional conditions have to be fulfilled : all electrons have to oscillate in the same plane ( for the radiation to be polarized identically for all electrons ) and with the same strength parameter ( to radiate at the same wavelength ) @xcite .",
    "the main difference between icl and fel is that , in icl , the strength parameter @xmath92 depends on both the energy and the transverse amplitude of motion @xmath335 , when fel it is a constant defined uniquely by the undulator parameters . in icl , different values of @xmath92 lead to an effective energy spread in @xmath822 . imposing that this energy spread is smaller than the pierce parameter @xmath76 leads to the condition @xmath823 for the admissible relative spread in the amplitude of motion @xmath335 .",

    "in addition , the repetition rate is problematic : while synchrotron facilities work at mhz repetition rate allowing one to considerably increase the signal - to - noise ratio , laser - based sources work at 10 hz on paper , but in practice they work in the single - shot regime in most 50 tw - class laser facilities to prevent rapid damage on optics such as in compressors .",

    "thanks to the high brightness of fel radiation , many experiments could be performed in single shot or with small data accumulation such that the low repetition rate of laser facilities becomes a more benign disadvantage than for incoherent sources .    in conclusion , this article gives a comprehensive review of the different mechanisms proposed for the production of femtosecond x - ray radiation from laser - plasma accelerators .",
