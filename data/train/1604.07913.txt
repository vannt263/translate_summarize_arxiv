    "helicity is the projection of the spin of a particle onto the direction of its momentum .",
    "helicity plays an important role in modern physics and a good understanding of the associated rules is important for interpreting many atomic , nuclear , and particle physics experiments .",
    "thus , development of intuition with respect to different aspects of helicity in quantum mechanics is a worthwhile exercise for classes that are taught to advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the angular correlations ( for example , between the spin of parent nucleus and the direction of emitted @xmath0 particle ) that arise in nuclear @xmath0 decays due to the combination of conservation of angular momentum and the helicity of the leptons . because we concentrate on nuclear @xmath0 decays we will use `` weak interaction '' as a synonym of `` _ charged _ weak interactions '' .",
    "measurements of correlations from nuclear @xmath0 decay originally established the vector minus axial - vector nature of the weak currents , known as @xmath1 , about 50 years ago .",
    "we will explain the significance of @xmath1 and describe new measurements of decay correlations being pursued in search of new physics with helicity properties that differ from the prescriptions of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "the correlations can be calculated using trace techniques of dirac s @xmath2 matrices and are sometimes brought up in this context as exercises for students learning relativistic quantum mechanics or field theory . on the other hand , the calculated expressions",
    "are often presented to students without this training along with comments to show their plausibility .",
    "in contrast , we present a more accessible derivation using tools learned in the elementary quantum mechanics classes for which most advanced undergraduates should be well equipped . moreover , those students capable of doing the calculations via trace techniques may not appreciate that the correlations arise simply from the conservation of angular momentum and the left - handedness of the emitted leptons .",
    "it is often far too easy to let the mathematical formalism overshadow the elegant and beautiful physical principles at work .",
    "the present paper is intended for a broad audience ; it is well suited for students that have completed an introductory quantum mechanics course , while providing supplementary material for the more advanced readers with experience in quantum field theory .",
    "we begin with a simple derivation of the @xmath0 asymmetry with respect to the polarization of the parent nucleus in sect .",
    "[ sec : helicity ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : currents ] we will present a brief description of the weak - interaction hamiltonian . although we present here the interactions using dirac s @xmath2 matrices , we think all that is needed to follow that section is a brief introduction to the dirac equation and instructors can use appendix  [ sec : appendix1 ] as a guideline . in sect .",
    "[ sec : fierz ] and [ sec : enu correlation ] we derive the so - called _ fierz interference _ term and the @xmath3 correlation . correlation '' to represent both electron - antineutrino and positron - neutrino correlations . ]",
    "the derivations are presented alongside a brief historical narrative , including the story of several experiments which wrongly led physicists to an incorrect theory of the weak interactions .",
    "a few contemporary experiments involving @xmath0-decay correlations are introduced in section  [ sec : contemporaryexp ] .",
    "the main features of @xmath0 decay are described in many textbooks.@xcite here we briefly discuss the aspects that are relevant for the present discussion .",
    "we start by considering the correlations between the spin polarization of the parent nucleus and the direction of the emitted electrons in the famous experiment of wu et al .",
    "@xcite which was one of the first experiments to confirm the hypothesis of parity violation by the weak interactions put forward by lee and yang.@xcite wu and collaborators polarized a sample of radioactive @xmath4 atoms and observed the distribution of emitted electrons relative to the direction of the initial nuclear spin polarization .",
    "the corresponding decay scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:60co - scheme ] .",
    ".,width=153 ]    in this section , we first consider the transition from the @xmath5 initial state ( @xmath6 is the `` magnetic quantum number '' ) to the @xmath7 final state . following the @xmath0-decay transition one unit of angular momentum along the direction of the initial polarization is lost from the nucleus , and this angular momentum must be carried away by the lepton spins . and",
    "@xmath8 ) carry no orbital angular momentum so only spins are of concern . ]",
    "thus , the spin projections of the two leptons onto the @xmath9 axis have to be @xmath10 each , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spincorrelation ] .",
    "one unit of angular momentum is lost by the nucleus and has to be carried out by the leptons . since the latter are spin-1/2 objects they have to both align their spins in the direction of the initial polarization .",
    "this , in conjunction with the helicities of the particles , determines the emission probabilities.,width=153 ]    for an electron ( or any other spin-1/2 particle ) emitted at an angle @xmath11 relative to the @xmath9-axis , the positive or negative helicity states @xmath12 can be expressed as linear combinations of spin - up and spin - down states along the @xmath9-axis @xmath13:@xcite@xmath14 @xmath15 for electrons in the negative - helicity state @xmath16 , the probability of finding the @xmath10 spin projection onto the @xmath9 axis is @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the probability per solid angle @xmath18 of emitting such an electron is given by : @xmath19 on the other hand , for positive - helicity electrons @xmath20    the parity transformation ( which inverts the sign of coordinates ) turns a negative - helicity particle into a positive - helicity particle . under the assumption of parity conservation",
    "the emitted leptons from @xmath4 should show no preference for either helicity state .",
    "the sum of the distributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helicity01 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : positive_helicity_distribution ] ) with equal weights does not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "thus , one would expect the electrons to be emitted uniformly in all directions .",
    "in one of the greatest surprises in modern physics wu and others@xcite found quite the opposite to be true .",
    "they discovered that the electron angular distribution was close to eq .",
    "( [ eq : helicity01 ] ) .",
    "it appeared as though only negative helicity electrons were being emitted .",
    "much to the surprise of researchers at that time , and still a surprise to many of us today , the laws of nature appear to have a preferred handedness .    in order to understand how this fact has been implemented into the standard model we need a new concept :",
    "_ chirality_. note that for a massive particle the helicity of a particle is not a lorentz invariant which does not change under rotations or boosts of the reference frame .",
    "an observer moving faster than the particle will see its helicity in the opposite direction .",
    "by contrast , chirality is a lorentz invariant .",
    "we follow konopinski@xcite who gives an intuitive description of chirality .",
    "consider an electron moving in the @xmath21 direction with momentum @xmath22 , energy @xmath23 , and spin along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "if we want to measure the velocity of this electron , we need to take an infinitesimal time period , so the energy uncertainty goes to infinity according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "however , particles with infinite energy move at the speed of light , @xmath24 , so the results of such a measurement are @xmath25 .",
    "we call this _ internal velocity_. the physical state moving at velocity and @xmath26 . ] @xmath27 can be described as a combination of a `` forward - motion '' along the path at speed @xmath24 with a probability @xmath28 and a `` backward - motion '' at speed @xmath24 with a probability @xmath29 .",
    "the physical velocity @xmath30 is just the mean velocity of this motion .",
    "we use @xmath31 to represent physical states with definite momentum , energy and spin ( up or down ) along the @xmath9 direction , and @xmath32 to represent the states with internal velocity @xmath33 or @xmath34 and spin up or down along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "then the physical state @xmath35 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38 a particle s chirality can be defined as `` the spin projection onto its internal velocity direction '' . in this sense , the state @xmath39 has right - handed chirality and @xmath40 has left - handed chirality .",
    "therefore , a state with well - defined helicity , momentum and energy , like @xmath35 , is a linear combination of two states with opposite chirality and relative amplitudes as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chirality_decompose ] ) .",
    "if we build up a state like @xmath41 which has definite right - handed chirality , it is not a free - particle state because its spin projection is not @xmath42 .",
    "if the particle is massless , then only one internal velocity state describes it , so the free - particle state contains only one chirality component . in this case",
    "helicity and chirality describe the same property of the particle .",
    "left - handed chirality is equivalent to negative helicity for massless particles .",
    "a formal description of free fermions is shown in appendix  [ sec : appendix1 ] using dirac spinors .",
    "the motion of a free fermion is governed by the dirac equation , which has two positive energy solutions , i.e. particle solutions , with well - defined energies , momenta and helicities ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac solutions ] ) ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that both momentum and helicity operators commute with the free particle hamiltonian .",
    "the spinor parts of these two solutions @xmath43 have opposite helicities , but both of them have non - zero left - handed chirality projections with amplitudes @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the left - handed chirality projection operator .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chirality_decompose ] ) . in the sm weak interactions involve only particles with left - handed chirality .",
    "therefore , for massive particles like electrons , both helicity states are involved in the weak interaction with amplitudes expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chirality_projection ] ) , and eq .  ( [ eq : helicity01 ] ) for @xmath46 has to be modified to take this into account .",
    "the correct expression for @xmath46 ( for `` @xmath47 '' transitions ) in the sm is @xmath48    in general , given that the nuclei experience a change of projection of angular momentum @xmath49 ( defined as @xmath50 ) along a quantization direction @xmath9 , the electron will have an angular distribution : @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "if the @xmath4 nucleus is in a state with @xmath53 ( for example @xmath54 ) , the final state can have different @xmath6 values ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "usually the spin projection of the final state of the daughter nucleus is difficult to detect , so one may sum over the probabilities of final states with different @xmath6 .",
    "the probabilities of decaying into these final states are not equal , but proportional to the square of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the spin and spin projection of the initial nuclear state , @xmath58 are the spin and spin projection of the final nuclear state , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the total angular momentum and its projection taken away by the leptons . after summing over the final nuclear states ,",
    "one gets the angular distribution : @xmath61 the proof of this equation is a bit too long to reproduce here , but it can be a good exercise for students when learning angular momentum raising and lowering operators and clebsch - gordan coefficients . defining the polarization vector for the initial ensemble of nuclei as @xmath62 , it follows that @xmath63 with the @xmath0 asymmetry correlation coefficient decays such as the decay of @xmath64co , because eq .  ( [ m / j ] ) does not apply for other cases .",
    "more advanced readers can try to derive the @xmath0 asymmetry coefficient @xmath65 for all initial and final @xmath66 s , and the results can be found in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath67 for the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "note that the expressions above show that the decay rate varies under the parity transformation which flips the sign of @xmath68 but not @xmath69 .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath65 by wu et al.@xcite showed clearly that parity conservation was violated by the weak interactions .",
    "another observable worth discussing is the polarization of emitted electrons , @xmath70 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chirality_projection ] ) , one can derive @xmath71 this was later directly confirmed by several experiments.@xcite    we have shown that assuming electrons emitted in @xmath0 decay have left - handed chirality leads to good agreement with experiment , but this does not completely determine the formalism of the weak interaction .",
    "one important missing piece of the theory is the helicity of the antineutrino , which is almost impossible to measure directly .",
    "the relationship between chirality and helicity for _ antiparticles _ is discussed in appendix  [ sec : appendix1 ] . according to the sm the chirality of antineutrinos involved in weak interactions is also left - handed , and left - handed antiparticles have _ positive _ helicity .",
    "if we take the sm description of antineutrinos for granted , namely that they have positive helicity , the angular distribution of the antineutrino around the direction of nuclear polarization is : @xmath72 with the antineutrino asymmetry correlation coefficient @xmath73 for the decay of @xmath4 . as we shall see in the following sections , neutrino helicities were determined through indirect measurements and the complete weak interaction formalism was built in the 1960s",
    "to understand the fierz interference and the @xmath3 correlation described in the following two sections , one has to go one level deeper into the weak interaction theory and understand the formalism of its hamiltonian . at the time when lee and yang proposed that parity was violated , little",
    "was known about the weak interaction .",
    "dirac had already shown how to solve problems involving electromagnetic interactions within a quantum theory that correctly takes into account relativity.@xcite for example , for electron scattering from a proton at low - momentum transfer ( so that internal nucleon excitations can be neglected ) the interaction can be expressed as a product of a nuclear current , a _",
    "propagator _ for the photon , and an electronic current:@xcite @xmath74 here the @xmath75 are dirac spinor operators which can annihilate a particle ( with certain momentum , energy , etc . ) in the initial state or create an antiparticle from vacuum , @xmath76 means @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the square of the 4-momentum transfer in the scattering process .",
    "the @xmath79 s are dirac s @xmath2 matrices with the properties : @xmath80 where @xmath81 stands for a @xmath82 identity matrix . to follow the derivations in the rest of this paper",
    ", it is adequate to remember the properties of the @xmath2 matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : commutation ] ) without mastering the full expressions of them shown in appendix  [ sec : appendix1 ] .",
    "fermi proposed a similar structure for the weak interactions:@xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 indicates the hermitian conjugate .",
    "the first term in @xmath85 describes an incoming neutrino ( or an outgoing antineutrino ) and an outgoing electron , while the @xmath84 term describes an incoming electron ( or an outgoing positron ) and an outgoing neutrino . for massive bosonic force carriers",
    "the propagator denominator is @xmath86 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the carrier . because the mass of the carrier for the weak interactions is much larger than the momenta involved in the nuclear weak transitions the propagator is constant to a very good approximation . when fermi proposed this form for the interaction it was unknown what the mass of the carrier was , but nowadays we know @xmath87 gev while the momentum transfer in nuclear @xmath0 decay is of the order of a few mev .",
    "in fact , the _ weakness _ of the weak interaction in nuclei is due to the large mass of the w compared to the energy released in @xmath0 decays .",
    "although fermi focused on the hypothesis of the vector interaction he indicated that other possibilities were allowed .",
    "many years later lee and yang@xcite explicitly included parity violation .",
    "thus , the general hamiltonian for the weak interaction can be expressed as : @xmath88 the @xmath89 s are constants that could be determined experimentally and the operators @xmath90 s are @xmath91 the corresponding currents @xmath92 are called , respectively , scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector , axial - vector ( or pseudo - vector ) , and tensor .",
    "the additional gamma matrix included here , @xmath93 , can be expressed in terms of the other four , @xmath94 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : commutation ] ) one can show that @xmath95 the property of the operators under parity transformation becomes evident if one considers what happens when the coordinates are inverted .",
    "note that under the parity transformation the spatial components of @xmath96 are odd and its time - like component ( energy ) is even .",
    "the kinetic term in the dirac equation @xmath97 is a lorentz scalar that is a lorentz scalar . ] ( or lorentz invariant ) .",
    "because a lorentz scalar has even parity , a lorentz scalar can only be the inner product of two vectors with the same parity .",
    "therefore , the spatial components of @xmath79 should be parity - odd , while its time - like component should be parity - even . because the @xmath93 matrix is the product of one time - like matrix and 3 space - like ones , it is parity - odd , and multiplication by it reverses the parity property of all operators .",
    "this @xmath93 matrix is by definition the chirality operator.@xcite consequently , the operators : @xmath98 are the projectors onto left- and right - handed chirality states . under parity transformation , @xmath99 turns into @xmath100 , so a left - handed state transforms to a right - handed state . in the relativistic limit ,",
    "when the masses of the particles are negligible compared to their energies , chirality is equivalent to helicity , so @xmath93 becomes the helicity operator and the two projectors above become the projectors onto the helicity states .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyhamiltonian ] ) can be re - written in terms of left- and right - handed lepton spinors .",
    "for the vector and axial - vector currents : @xmath101 for the scalar and tensor currents ( potentially new physics ) : @xmath102 the notation @xmath103 is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrva ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrst ] ) .",
    "we have ignored the pseudo - scalar currents because they turn out to be very small in nuclear @xmath0 decays . in this article",
    "we will assume the constants @xmath89 to be real .",
    "as we will describe later , present limits on these non - standard model couplings ( @xmath104 ) are of order @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite allowing for complex phases brings in time - reversal symmetry violation , which is very interesting,@xcite but subject for another paper . notice that while the vector and axial - vector currents couple incoming and outgoing particles with identical chiralities , the scalar and tensor currents do the opposite",
    "this is a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : commutation2 ] ) .",
    "though wu et al . found that the electrons from nuclear @xmath0 decays mostly have negative helicity and thus only electrons with left - handed chirality are involved in nuclear @xmath0 decays , they could not determine the helicity of the emitted antineutrino .",
    "additional experiments were proposed to determine whether the currents were scalar , vector , axial - vector or tensor , or some combination of these . as we will see , eventually they determined that the weak interaction is primarily mediated by vector and axial - vector currents .",
    "the form of hadronic currents also affects the changes of nuclear angular momenta in @xmath0 decays .",
    "conventionally , nuclear @xmath0 decays are classified according to the change in angular momentum @xmath66 and isospin @xmath106 .",
    "some basics on isospin are given in appendix  [ sec : appendix3 ] .",

    "the differential decay rate is proportional to the product of the transition matrix element @xmath117 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the initial and final states . using the decomposition of @xmath121 into @xmath122 and @xmath123 ,",
    "there are two cross terms in the differential decay rate , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are also called interference terms . if both vector ( axial - vector ) and scalar ( tensor ) currents existed this interference effect should be present . to fix ideas we first consider fermi transitions , so that only vector and scalar currents contribute .",
    "we also assume neutrinos are massless so the antineutrino final state with definite helicity has only one chirality component . therefore , after substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrva ] ) and eq .",

    "a summary of the values of @xmath162 for different cases is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : enucorrelation ]          in 1932 heisenberg noted that the nuclear force between nucleons seemed to be independent on whether the nucleons were neutrons or protons .",

    "thus , one can approximately treat the nucleons as identical particles , except that protons and neutrons are fermions and the pauli exclusion principle has to be satisfied within each species .",
    "heisenberg realized that the problem is similar to that of having identical fermions with two possible spin orientations .",

    "the quantum number for the total isospin number @xmath106 is restricted to @xmath182 .",
