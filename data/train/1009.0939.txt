    "the aim of this paper is to explore the appearance of planar algebra structure in three areas of mathematics : subfactor theory ; free probability theory ; and random matrices .",
    "jones subfactor theory has lead to a revolution in understanding what may be termed `` quantum symmetry '' .",
    "the standard invariant of a subfactor  the so - called lattice of higher relative commutants , or `` @xmath1-lattice '' @xcite is a remarkable mathematical object , which can represent a very general type of symmetry .",
    "for example , a subfactor inclusion ( and so its standard invariant ) can be associated to a lie group representation . in this case , the vector spaces that make up the standard invariant are the spaces of intertwiners between tensor powers of that representation .",
    "thus the standard invariant of such a subfactor can be used to encode the representation theory of a lie group , and thus symmetries associated with lie group actions .    in his groundbreaking paper @xcite jones",
    "( building on an earlier algebraic axiomatization of standard invariants by popa @xcite ) showed that there is a striking way to characterize standard invariants of subfactors : these are exactly _ planar algebras _",
    "( see  [ sub : planar - algebras ] below for a definition ) .",
    "very roughly , one can think of a planar algebra as a sequence of vector spaces consisting of vectors invariant under some `` quantum symmetry '' , together with very general ways ( dictated by planar diagrams ) of producing new invariant vectors from existing vectors .",
    "the planar algebra thus _ encodes _ the underlying symmetry . in the context of the present paper",
    ", we shall use the terms `` quantum symmetry '' and `` planar algebra '' interchangeably .    curiously , planar diagrams also occur in random matrix theory . certain random multi - matrix ensembles ( see [ sub : free - analogs - ofgibbs ] below ) are asymptotically described by combinatorics involving counting _ planar maps _ ( these objects are very much like planar diagrams appearing in the definition of planar algebras ) .",
    "this fact has been discovered and extensively used by physicists , starting from the works of t hooft , brezin , iszykson , parisi , zuber and others ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a rigorous proof of convergence was obtained by guionnet and maurel segala ( see @xcite and references therein ) and ercolani and mclaughlin @xcite .    finally ,",
    "turning to voiculescu s free probability theory @xcite , it was shown by speicher @xcite and others that many important free probability laws ( such as the semicircle law , the free poisson law and so on ) have combinatorial descriptions involving counting planar objects ( such as non - crossing partitions , which are also very closely related to planar diagrams ) .",
    "thus one is faced with two natural questions .",
    "first , why do these planar structures appear in these three areas ? and second , how can these similarities be exploited ?    concerning the first question ,",
    "we do not know a fully satisfactory answer .",
    "however , if one grants that planar structure is necessary to describe `` quantum symmetries '' ( i.e. , subfactors ) , then one is able to find explanations for appearances of planar structure in free probability theory and random matrices .",
    "we show that one has a natural notion of a _ non - commutative probability law having a quantum symmetry _  this law is given by a trace on a ring naturally associated to a planar algebra .",
    "mathematically , this is accomplished by a `` change of rings '' procedure , where we replace the ring of non - commutative polynomials in @xmath2 variables with a certain canonical ring associated to a given planar algebra ( see  [ sub : planaralgebraprobspace ] ) .",
    "this `` change of rings '' is analogous to the passage from some probability space @xmath3 to the quotient space @xmath4 in the case that the laws of some family of random variables are invariant under the action of a group @xmath5 .",
    "also , we show how to construct random matrix ensembles , which asymptotically give rise to a non - commutative law with a given quantum symmetry .",
    "this means that any time one considers a natural equation in free probability theory , or a natural equation giving the asymptotics of a random matrix ensemble , this equation must make sense not only as an equation involving polynomials in @xmath2 non - commuting indeterminates , but also arbitrary planar algebra elements .",
    "thus the equation ( and so its solutions ) must have a natural planar structure .",
    "concerning the second question , we give a number of applications of our techniques .",
    "one such application is a version of the ground - breaking theorem of popa @xcite which states that every planar algebra @xmath0 arises from a subfactor @xmath6 with @xmath7 isomorphic to free group factors .",
    "it turns out that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 can in fact be chosen to be natural non - commutative probability spaces `` in the presence of the symmetry @xmath0 '' . on the random matrix side",
    ", our approach gives a mathematical framework to formulate the work of a number of physics authors @xcite on the so - called @xmath10 matrix model .",
    "in fact , using our techniques one can make rigorous sense of the @xmath10 matrix model for @xmath11 ( non - integer values of @xmath12 are used in the physics literature ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss some basic notions from free probability theory and subfactors .",
    "next , we discuss a notion of a non - commutative probability law having a symmetry encoded by a planar algebra @xmath0 and present some applications to subfactor theory .",
    "finally , we show that one can construct random matrix ensembles that model certain non - commutative laws with a given planar algebra symmetry @xmath0 , and explain connections with a class of random matrix ensembles used in the physics literature , and derive some random matrix consequences .",
    "this paper is based on the joint work with a. guionnet and v.f.r .",
    "jones @xcite .",
    "recall ( see for example @xcite ) that an algebraic non - commutative probability space @xmath13 consists of an algebra @xmath14 with unit @xmath15 and a unital linear functional @xmath16 .",
    "we often make the assumption that @xmath14 is a @xmath17-algebra and @xmath18 is a _ trace _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "elements of @xmath14 are called _ non - commutative random variables_. here are a few examples :    \\(a ) if @xmath21 is a measure space and @xmath22 is a probability measure , then @xmath23 is a non - commutative probability space .",
    "+ ( b ) for any @xmath8 , the algebra of @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 is a non - commutative probability space .",
    "+ ( c ) consider @xmath26 , with @xmath21 as in ( a ) .",
    "thus elements of @xmath14 are _ random matrices_. then @xmath27 is a non - commutative probability space .    note that in all of these examples , @xmath18 is a trace : @xmath28 .    in order to be able to do analysis on non - commutative probability spaces",
    "we make the assumption that the algebra @xmath13 is represented ( by bounded or unbounded operators ) on a hilbert space @xmath29 by a faithful unital representation @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 for some fixed vector @xmath32 .",
    "elements of non - commutative probability spaces are called non - commutative random variables .      given @xmath33 classical real random variables @xmath34 , which we can think of as an @xmath35-valued function @xmath36 on some probability space @xmath21 , their joint law is defined to be the push - forward by @xmath37 of @xmath22 to a probability measure on @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath22 has finite moments , we obtain a linear functional on the algebra of polynomials on @xmath35 .    by analogy , given non - commutative random variables @xmath38 ,",
    "their _ non - commutative law @xmath39 _ is the linear function on the algebra of all non - commutative polynomials in @xmath2 indeterminates @xmath40 $ ] obtained by composing @xmath18 with the canonical map sending @xmath41 to @xmath42 . in other words@xmath43 for any non - commutative polynomial @xmath44 .    if @xmath45 , non - commutative laws are the same as commutative laws , modulo identification of measures with linear functionals they induce on polynomials by integration .",
    "for example , in the case of a single self - adjoint matrix @xmath46 , its non - commutative law corresponds to integration against the measure @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are the eigenvalues of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath49 is a random matrix , its non - commutative law captures the expected value of the random spectral measures associated to @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the classical notion of independence of random variables can be reformulated algebraically by stating that @xmath51 is independent from @xmath52 in a non - commutative probability space @xmath53 if the law of @xmath54 is the same as that of the variables@xmath55 here @xmath56 , @xmath57 are two natural embeddings of @xmath14 into @xmath58 .",
    "voiculescu developed his _ free probability theory _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) around another notion of independence , free independence . for this notion",
    ", we say that @xmath51 is freely independent from @xmath52 in a non - commutative probability space @xmath53 if the law of @xmath54 is the same as that of the variables@xmath59 where @xmath17 denotes the free product @xcite , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 are the natural embeddings of @xmath14 into @xmath62 ( into the first and second copy , respectively ) .    if @xmath18 is a non - commutative law satisfying positivity and boundedness requirements , the gns construction yields a representation of @xmath40 $ ] on @xmath63 and thus generates a von neumann algebra @xmath64 .",
    "the non - commutative case here differs significantly from the commutative case . in the commutative case , @xmath65 , and ,",
    "notably , all measure spaces @xmath66 are isomorphic ( at least for laws @xmath18 which are non - atomic ) . in the non - commutative case ,",
    "the von neumann algebras @xmath64 are much more diverse , and it is in general a very difficult and challenging question to decide , for two laws @xmath67 , when @xmath68 , or to somehow identify the isomorphism class of @xmath64 .",
    "consider a complex - valued classical random variable @xmath69 ; thus we actually have a pair of random variables @xmath70 , whose joint law is described by a probability measure @xmath22 on @xmath71 : for any function of two variables @xmath72 , we are interested in the value@xmath73 in this way , the law of @xmath74 is a functional on the space of functions on @xmath75 .",
    "assume that we know that the law of @xmath74 is invariant under rotations : @xmath76 for any @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "then the joint law of @xmath74 is completely determined by its `` radial part '' , the integrals of the form@xmath79 and thus defines a linear functional on the space of rotation - invariant functions , i.e. , effectively on the space of functions on @xmath80 .",
    "thus the _ presence of a symmetry dictates that we use a different probability space_. our aim is to extend this observation to the non - commutative setting , allowing the most general notions of symmetry possible .",
    "we defined a non - commutative probability law to be a linear functional @xmath18 defined on the algebra @xmath81 $ ] of non - commutative polynomials in @xmath2 variables .",
    "if symmetries are present , this choice of the algebra @xmath14 may not be suitable . in this case",
    "the algebra @xmath14 ( the non - commutative analog of the ring of polynomials on @xmath35 ) must be replaced by the analog of the ring of functions on a different algebraic variety .",
    "for instance , one may be interested in @xmath17-probability spaces , i.e. , we want to have an algebra @xmath14 that has a non - trivial adjoint operation ( involution ) .",
    "this can be accomplished by considering the algebra @xmath82 $ ] and defining @xmath83 to be the adjoint of @xmath42 .",
    "an even more interesting situation is the case that our algebra @xmath84 has a natural symmetry .",
    "for example , we may consider the action of the unitary group @xmath85 on @xmath84 given on the generators by@xmath86 in this case we may only be interested in a part of @xmath84 , the algebra @xmath87 consisting of @xmath85-invariant elements .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath87 is not even a finitely - generated algebra , but it is the natural non - commutative probability space on which to define @xmath85-invariant laws .    more generally , in this paper we will be interested in non - commutative laws defined on a class of `` symmetry algebras '' , which are the analogs of algebras such as @xmath87 above for more general symmetries ( including actions of quantum groups ) .    as is well - known , subfactor theory of jones provides a framework for considering such very general symmetries . to formalize our notion of a `` non - commutative probability law with a quantum symmetry '' , we shall first review jones notion of planar algebras @xcite .",
    "planar algebras @xcite were introduced by jones in his study of invariants of subfactors of ii@xmath88 factors .",
    "let @xmath89 be an inclusion of ii@xmath88 factors of finite jones index @xcite .",
    "then @xmath90 can be regarded as a bimodule over @xmath91 by using the left and right multiplication action of @xmath91 on @xmath90 . using the operation of the relative tensor product of bimodules ( see e.g. @xcite ) one can construct other @xmath92-bimodules by considering tensor powers@xmath93 one can then consider the intertwiner spaces@xmath94 consisting of all homomorphisms from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , which are linear for both the left and the right action of @xmath91 . because the index of @xmath89 is finite ,",
    "these spaces turn out to be finite - dimensional . the system of intertwiner spaces @xmath97 has more structure than the algebra structure of the individual @xmath97 s .",
    "for example , having an intertwiner @xmath98 one can also construct an `` induced representation '' intertwiner @xmath99 .",
    "more generally , one can restrict intertwiners , take their tensor products , etc .",
    ", thus providing many operations involving elements of the various @xmath97 s .",
    "the following example explains how classical representation theory of a lie group can be viewed in subfactor terms .",
    "similar examples exist also in the case of quantum group representations :    let @xmath5 be a lie group and @xmath100 be an irreducible representation of @xmath5 , and denote by @xmath101 the representation on the dual of @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a ii@xmath88 factor carrying an action of @xmath5 satisfying a technical condition of being properly outer ( such an action always exists with @xmath9 a hyperfinite ii@xmath88 factor or a free group factor ) .",
    "consider the `` wassermann - type '' inclusion@xmath102 here @xmath103 denotes the fixed points algebra for an action of @xmath5 on @xmath8 , and @xmath5 acts on @xmath104 by conjugation .",
    "then@xmath105 is the space of all @xmath5-invariant linear maps on @xmath106 .",
    "the main theorem of jones @xcite is that there is a beautiful abstract characterization of systems of intertwiner spaces associated to a subfactor ( also called `` standard invariants '' , `` @xmath1-lattices '' , systems of higher - relative commutants ) : such systems are exactly the _ planar algebras_. his proof relied on an earlier axiomatization of @xmath1-lattices by popa @xcite .      to state the definition of a planar algebra ,",
    "let us introduce the notion of a _",
    "planar tangle @xmath107 _ with @xmath108 input disks or sizes @xmath109 and output disk of size @xmath110 ( we ll write @xmath111 for the set of such tangles ) . such a tangle is given by drawing ( up to isotopy on the plane ) @xmath108 `` input '' disks @xmath112 inside the `` output '' disk @xmath113 .",
    "each disk @xmath114 has @xmath115 points marked on its boundary ( one of which is marked as the `` first '' point ) .",
    "the output disk @xmath113 has @xmath116 points marked on its boundary , one of which is marked `` first '' .",
    "furthermore , all marked boundary points are connected to other marked points by non - crossing paths .",
    "are colored by two colors , so that adjacent regions are colored by different colors .",
    "we shall , however , ignore this part of this structure in this paper . ]",
    "figure [ fig : planar - tangles](a ) shows an example of a planar tangle in @xmath117 ; the first point on each interior disk is labeled by a @xmath17 .",
    "note that tangles may contain loops which are not connected to any interior disks .",
    "tangles can be composed by gluing the output disk of one tangle inside an input disk of another tangle in a way that aligns points marked `` first '' and preserves the orientation of boundaries ( see figure [ fig : planar - tangles](b ) , which illustrates the composition of a tangle in @xmath117 with three tangles , from @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "( this is only possible if disks are of matching sizes ) .",
    "let @xmath121 be a collection of vector spaces .",
    "we say that @xmath122 forms a planar algebra if any planar tangle _ _ @xmath123 gives rise to a multi - linear operation @xmath124 in such a way that the assignment @xmath125 is natural with respect to composition of tangles and of multilinear maps .",
    "very roughly , one should think of the spaces @xmath126 as the space of `` intertwiners '' of degree @xmath116 for some quantum symmetry ( see  [ sub : planar - algebras - of - polynomials ] below ) .",
    "the various operations @xmath127 correspond to the various ways of combining such intertwiners to form new intertwiners .",
    "we also often make the assumption that the space @xmath128 is one - dimensional and all @xmath126 are finite - dimensional .",
    "in particular , a tangle @xmath107 with no input disks and one output disk with zero marked points and no paths inside gives rise to a basis element of @xmath128 , which we ll denote by @xmath129 .",
    "if we instead consider a tangle @xmath130 with no input disks , one output disk with no marked points , and a simple closed loop inside of the output disk , then @xmath130 produces an element @xmath131 in @xmath128 ( where @xmath132 is some fixed number ) .",
    "furthermore , it follows from naturality of composition of tangles that if some tangle @xmath107 is obtained from a tangle @xmath130 by removing a closed loop , then @xmath133 .",
    "the tangle in figure [ fig : canonical - bilinear - form - and - tl](a ) gives rise to a bilinear form on each @xmath134 , which we assume to be non - negative definite .",
    "we endow each @xmath126 with an involution compatible with the action of orientation - preserving planar maps on tangles .",
    "finally , we assume a spherical symmetry , so that we consider tangles up to isotopy on the sphere ( and not just the plane ) .    a planar algebra satisfying these additional requirements",
    "is called a _ subfactor planar algebra _ with parameter @xmath132 .",
    "it is a famous result of jones @xcite that @xmath135 , and all of these values can occur .",
    "planar algebras can be thought of as families of linear spaces consisting of vectors `` obeying a symmetry '' , where the word symmetry is taken in a very generalized sense ( such `` symmetries '' include group actions as well as quantum group actions ) .",
    "we consider a few examples :      let @xmath136 be indeterminates , and denote by @xmath14 the algebra spanned by alternating monomials of the form @xmath137 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the linear subspace of @xmath14 consisting of all elements that have degree @xmath116 .",
    "we claim that @xmath138 is a planar algebra if endowed with the following structure .",
    "given a monomial @xmath139 , associate to it the labeled disk @xmath140 whose @xmath116 boundary points are labeled ( clockwise , from the `` first '' point ) by the @xmath116-tuple @xmath141 .",
    "now given a planar tangle @xmath123 and monomials @xmath142 of appropriate degrees , we define@xmath143 here the sum is over all monomials @xmath144 and @xmath145 are integers obtained as follows .",
    "glue the disks @xmath146 into the input disks of @xmath107 and then the output disk of @xmath107 into @xmath140 .",
    "we obtain a collection of disks , whose marked boundary points are connected by curves .",
    "then @xmath145 is the total number of ways to assign integers from @xmath147 to these curves , so that each curve has the same label as its endpoints .",
    "( @xmath148 if no such assignment exists ) .    in this case",
    ", @xmath0 is actually a subfactor planar algebra with parameter @xmath149 ( the number of ways to assign an integer from @xmath147 to a closed loop ) .",
    "the corresponding subfactor inclusion is rather trivial : it corresponds to the @xmath150 matrix inclusion @xmath151 , for any ii@xmath88 factor @xmath9 .",
    "consider the action of the unitary group @xmath85 on each @xmath126 defined by .",
    "in other words , we identify @xmath126 with the @xmath110-th tensor power of @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the basic representation of @xmath85 .",
