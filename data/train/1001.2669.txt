    "the patterns formed in dewetting processes have attracted strong interest since reiter analysed the process quantitatively in the early nineties . in these experiments , that proved to be a paradigm in our understanding of dewetting , a uniform thin film of polystyrene ( tens of nanometers thick ) is deposited on a flat silicon oxide substrate",

    "the gold core of 2  3 nm diameter is coated by a layer of alkyl - thiol molecules .",
    "the length of the carbon backbone of the thiol used in the experiments ranges from 6 to 12 carbon atoms ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) @xcite . by varying the chain length",
    ", one can control to a certain extent the particle - particle attraction .",
    "normally , the solution is deposited on to a plain silicon substrate that is covered by the native oxide layer only @xcite .",
    "however , one may locally change the wetting behaviour of the solvent by further oxidising the substrate @xcite . by adding excess thiol",
    "one can also vary the properties of the solvent @xcite .",
    "two different procedures are employed for the deposition of the solution on to the substrate : spin - coating or a meniscus technique @xcite .",
    "the choice is important as it strongly influences the evaporation rate and , as a result , the pattern formation process .",
    "when using spin - coating , one finds that directly after deposition , evaporation competes with dewetting until all the solvent has evaporated .",
    "the resulting deposits of nanoparticles are imaged by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) . for spin - coated films ,",
    "the evaporation rate is high and structuring is normally finished before the spin - coater is stopped .",
    "conversely , the solvent evaporation rate is strongly decreased when employing the meniscus technique @xcite , i.e. , by depositing a drop of solution on a teflon ring that is wetted by the solvent .",
    "this allows for a better control of the process and enables the use of contrast - enhanced microscopy to observe the dewetting process in situ @xcite .",
    "all pattern formation is confined to the region of the receding contact line of toluene , silicon and air . with both techniques",
    "one may find mono - modal or bi - modal polygonal networks @xcite , labyrinthine spinodal structures , or branched patterns ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : finger ] ) .",
    "the meniscus technique allows for the study of branched structures in a more controlled manner . the work in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that fingering strongly depends on the interaction strength of the particles , i.e. , on the chain length of the thiol molecules coating the gold cores . for short chains ( c@xmath5 and c@xmath6 )",
    "no formation of branched structures is observed . at similar concentrations ,",
    "well - developed branched structures are formed for longer chains ( c@xmath7 and c@xmath8 ) . for even longer chains ( c@xmath9 )",
    ", however , one again finds less branching .",
    "it also depends on the amount of excess thiol in the solvent ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .    when following the evolution of the branched patterns in situ ( see the complementary video material of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one clearly observes that different processes occur on different lenght scales .",
    "first , a macroscopic dewetting front recedes , leaving behind a seemingly dry substrate",
    ". the macroscopic front can be transversely unstable resulting in large - scale ( @xmath10 m ) strongly anisotropic fingered structures . for fronts that move relatively quickly these macroscopic structures cover all the available substrate .",
    "however , when at a later stage the macroscopic front becomes slower , those fingers become scarce and ` macroscopic fingering ' finally ceases . at this stage",
    "it is possible to appreciate that the seemingly dry region left behind by the front is not at all dry , but covered by an ultrathin ` postcursor ' film that is itself unstable .",
    "the thickness of this film is similar to the size of the nanoparticles . at a certain distance from the macroscopic front ,",
    "the ultrathin film starts to evolve a locally isotropic pattern of holes .",
    "the holes themselves grow in an unstable manner resulting in an array of isotropically branched structures as shown , e.g. , above in fig .",
    "[ fig : finger ] .",
    "this indicates that at least some of the patterns described in the literature may have arisen from processes in similar ultrathin ` postcursor ' films .",
    "the existence of the ultrathin ` postcursor ' film is an experimental finding that can be drawn on when choosing a theoretical approach to account for the pattern formation ( see below ) .",
    "note however , that at the moment there exists no explanation for its existence .",
    "a possible hypothesis is that the substrate strongly attracts the nanoparticles . as a result they form a dense suspension layer having a thickness roughly equal to the diameter of the nanoparticles .",
    "the observed mesoscopic dewetting front then actually correspond to an autophobic dewetting of a low concentration suspension from the higher concentration suspension on the surface of the substrate .",
    "models of dewetting thin films of pure liquids or polymers are often based on thin film hydrodynamics .",
    "starting from the stokes equations , together with continuity and boundary conditions at the substrate and free surface , one applies a long - wave approximation ( assuming small surface slopes and contact angles ) @xcite and obtains a non - linear evolution equation for the film thickness profile @xmath11 . in the case of volatile liquids",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath12 \\,-\\ , q_{\\mathrm{e}}\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta h } , { \\label{eq : film}}\\ ] ] with the mobility functions @xmath13 ( assuming poiseuille flow in the film and no slip at the substrate ; @xmath14 is the dynamic viscosity ) and @xmath15 for the convective and evaporative part of the dynamics , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is a rate constant that can be obtained from gas kinetic theory or from experiment @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : film ] ) only applies if the pressure in the vapour above the film is close to the saturation pressure . for alternative expressions that are used to describe",
    "the non - conserved evaporative dynamics see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",

    "since @xmath25 corresponds to a chemical potential , the term @xmath26 may either bias the system towards the liquid or towards the gas state .",
    "the variation of @xmath27 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath28 gives the pressure .",
    "it contains the curvature ( laplace ) pressure @xmath29 and the disjoining pressure @xmath30 .",
    "many different forms for the latter are in use ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the present system a thin film description using eq .",
    "( [ eq : film ] ) is not appropriate because the nanoparticles are not taken into account .",
    "however , under certain conditions one can augment equation  ( [ eq : film ] ) for the evolution of the film thickness by coupling it to an equation for the evolution of the mean particle concentration .",
    "the resulting model is able to describe the behaviour of an evaporating solution on the meso- and macroscale .",
    "such an approach is briefly discussed below in section  [ sec : tfh ] .",
    "we should expect such a model to describe the mesoscopic dewetting front discussed above .",
    "however , the theory is less suited to a description of the dewetting dynamics of the ultrathin postcursor film .",
    "the dewetting of the ultrathin film of highly concentrated suspension may be described by a discrete stochastic model such as , for instance , a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) model based solely on evaporation / condensation dynamics of the solvent and diffusion of the solute @xcite .",
    "the validity of this strong assumption regarding the relevant transport processes can be confirmed from an estimate based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : film ] ) : the pressure @xmath31 drives convection and evaporation .",
    "the convective mobility is proportional to @xmath32 , i.e. , it is large for thick films but decreases strongly with reduced film thickness . the evaporative mobility , however , is a constant , implying that evaporation will dominate below a certain ( cross - over ) thickness . for the parameter values of ref .",
    "@xcite and a small contact angle ( @xmath33 ) , the cross - over thickness is in the range of 1 - 5 nanometers .",
    "this estimate justifies the neglect of convective transport in a description of the postcursor film and may explain why one has such good agreement between the experimentally observed patterns and the patterns obtained from a purely two - dimensional ( single layer ) kinetic monte carlo model @xcite .",
    "we introduce the kmc model below in section  [ sec : kmc ] .",
    "in several respects , however , the kinetic monte carlo model is rather simplistic , limiting its potential applications .",
    "for instance , the thermodynamic chemical potential as well as any wetting interaction of the solvent with the substrate are collected in a single parameter  an effective chemical potential .",
    "this implies that any influence of a disjoining pressure is ` smeared out ' over the whole system and that no distinction between the short- and the long - range parts of the disjoining pressure is possible .",
    "it is furthermore based on the assumption that evaporation / condensation is the dominant dynamic process , but does not allow one to probe this assumption . in section  [ sec : ddft ] we show how one may develop a dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) that describes the system at a similar level to the kmc .",
    "however , the ddft may also be easily extended to include other effects such as fluid diffusion , that the kmc does not incorporate .      the kinetic monte carlo model for two - dimensional dewetting nanofluids @xcite",
    "was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended to include next - nearest neighbour interactions in @xcite .",
    "the two key assumptions used are : ( i ) the relevant processes can be mapped on to a two - dimensional lattice gas model , thereby neglecting continuous changes in the thickness of the evaporating film , and ( ii ) all relevant dynamics results from diffusing nanoparticles and evaporating / condensing solvent .",
    "the model builds on an ising - type model for the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the surface is divided up into a regular array of lattice sites whose size is dictated by the nanoparticles .",
    "one then considers each lattice site to be occupied either by a nanoparticle , liquid or vapour .",
    "this effectively maps the system onto a two - dimensional two - component lattice gas having two fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting three possible states of a cell are : liquid ( @xmath36 ) , nanoparticle ( @xmath37 ) , and vapour ( @xmath38 , i.e. , cell empty ) .",
    "the energy of an overall configuration is given by the hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a sum over nearest neighbour pairs and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the liquid - liquid , particle - particle and liquid - particle interaction energies , respectively .",
    "fixing the three interaction strength parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the effective chemical potential @xmath25 determines the equilibrium state of the system .",
    "we choose @xmath41 as unit of energy ",
    "i.e.  we set @xmath44 .",
    "the hamiltonian determines the equilibrium state and the energy landscape of the system .",
    "however , as the system ` dries in ' during the course of the solvent evaporation , the final nanoparticle configurations do not necessarily represent equilibrium structures .",
    "this implies that the system dynamics is of paramount importance .",
    "it is determined by the possible monte carlo moves , their relative frequencies , and the probabilities for their acceptance .",
    "two types of moves are allowed : ( i ) evaporation / condensation of liquid and ( ii ) diffusion of nanoparticles within the liquid .",
    "a mobility @xmath45 corresponds to the ratio of cycles of particle and solvent moves and reflects the physical ratio of time scales for evaporation and diffusion .",

    "a straight liquid - gas interface will recede [ advance ] for @xmath70 [ @xmath68 ] , i.e.  one finds evaporative dewetting [ wetting ] fronts . if one starts , however , with a substrate covered homogeneously by the liquid , for @xmath70 the film will dewet via a nucleation or spinodal - like process . if the nanoparticles are present , they form dried - in structures when all the liquid evaporates .",
    "the final structures do not normally change any further  at least on short time scales .",
    "however , if the liquid wets the particles ( i.e.  is attracted to the particles ) , over long times there might be a coarsening of the structures , facilitated by the adsorbed liquid .",
    "the dried - in patterns depend on the particular pathway taken by the evaporative dewetting process .",
    "they range from labyrinthine to polygonal network structures or holes in a dense particle layer .",

    "they look very similar to the patterns seen for the pure solvent and one might argue that the particles solely act as passive tracers and preserve the transient volatile dewetting structures of the solvent .",
    "this was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite for dewetting collagen solutions .",
    "however , panels ( c ) and ( d ) indicate that the particles may at times play a rather more significant role .",
    "when the diffusion of the particles is slow , the evaporative dewetting fronts become transversely unstable and may result in strongly ramified patterns .",
    "this instability is caused by the nanoparticles . the lower their mobility , the stronger the fingering effect , i.e. , there are more fingers in ( c ) than in ( d ) because in the latter the mobility is larger .",
    "the front instability is intriguing as it results in strongly branched structures . as the dewetting",
    "front moves , new branches are continuously created and existing branches merge at the moving contact line . however , the mean finger number in the streamwise direction of the resulting ramified pattern is a constant .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast to the front instabilities found for dewetting polymers which only result in fingers without side - branches @xcite or fields of droplets left behind @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis shows that the mean number of fingers depends only very weakly on the average concentration of the nanoparticles @xmath73 ; only the mean finger width increases with increasing concentration . however",
    ", decreasing the mobility ( i.e. , decreasing the diffusivity of the particles ) leads to a much denser finger pattern and also causes the front instability to appear at an earlier stage , i.e. , when the front instability is in its initial linear regime , it has a higher growth rate and a smaller characteristic wavelength ( cf .",
    "[ fig : nanopatt](c ) and ( d ) ) . decreasing the effective chemical potential ( increasing its absolute value ) has a similar but less strong effect .",
    "for details see @xcite .",
    "these findings lead to the conclusion that the determining factor for the front instability is the ratio of the time - scales of the different transport processes .",
    "in particular , the front becomes more unstable when the velocity of the dewetting front increases as compared to the mean diffusion velocity of the nanoparticles .",
    "if the particle diffusivity is low , the front ` collects ' the particles , resulting in a build up of the particles at the front that itself is slowed down .",
    "this makes the front unstable and any fluctuation along the front will trigger a transverse instability that results in an evolving fingering pattern .",
    "this happens even when the particle - liquid and particle - particle attractive interactions do not favour clustering ( i.e.  demixing of the liquid and the nanoparticles ) . in this regime",
    ", the instability is a purely dynamic effect and energetics plays no role in determining the number of fingers .",
    "we call this the ` transport regime ' .    to illustrate the influence of energetics ( characterized by the interaction parameters @xmath74 ) on fingering in fig .",
    "[ fig : fingers - enl ] we display the dependence of the mean finger number on particle - liquid interaction strength @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath75 the mean finger number @xmath76 is nearly constant ; this is the transport regime .",
    "however , on decreasing @xmath43 below 1.5 , we observe a marked increase in the value of @xmath76 , indicating that energy plays an important role in determining the number of fingers in this regime . in this parameter range ,",
    "demixing of particles and liquid occurs at the moving front and increases its transverse instability . in this ` demixing regime ' , the wavelength of the fingering instability is determined by the dynamics _ and _ the energetics of the system .",
    "decreasing @xmath43 further ( below @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fingers - enl ] ) one first observes in regime ( iii ) a slight decrease in the average finger number .",
    "this is a geometric effect resulting from our one - dimensional finger counting routine : the fingers increasingly break up and the dried - in pattern looks progressively isotropic . in regime ( iv ) , the measure @xmath78 does not represent a finger number but instead indicates a decrease in the typical distance between particle clusters resulting from the demixing process that occurs already in the bulk liquid and is not related to the front instability at all . note that one finds a similar sequence of regimes ( i ) to ( iv ) when increasing the particle - particle interaction strengths for fixed @xmath43 ( see ref .",

    "[ fig : fingers - enl ]    we note also that the fingering process may be viewed as self - optimising the front motion ",
    "i.e.  the front keeps its average velocity constant by expelling particles into the fingers . a similar effect exists for dewetting polymer films @xcite , where liquid is expelled from the growing moving rim which collects the dewetted polymer .",
    "there , the surplus liquid is left on the surface as a droplet pattern .",
    "the kinetic monte carlo model is a very useful tool that helps one to understand the pattern formation in drying nanoparticle suspensions .",
    "one has , however , to keep in mind the restrictions on the model ( see above ) .",
    "the purely two - dimensional character of the kmc was extended to a ` pseudo three - dimensional ' one by making the effective chemical potential dependent on the mean liquid coverage @xcite .",
    "as the latter is related to a mean film thickness , this corresponds to the introduction of a ` global ' thickness - dependent disjoining pressure into the evaporation term without an explicit consideration of a film thickness .",
    "the amended model can reproduce bimodal structures that are beyond the scope of the purely two - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "fully three - dimensional models are also discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the limitations of the kinetic monte carlo model introduced in the previous section are related to its character as a two - dimensional lattice gas with only three states : gas , liquid or particle .",
    "this implies that ( i ) no liquid can be transported to a site on the surface already filled with liquid , i.e. , diffusion of the liquid can not be incorporated in a sensible way and ( ii ) one is not able to distinguish between the influence of the short- and the long - range parts of the interactions with the substrate , as all such interactions are absorbed into the effective chemical potential .",
    "however , using dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite one can develop a model for the processes in the ultrathin postcursor film without these limitations , although here we limit ourselves to developing the theory at the level of the kmc and solely discuss how to extend it to incorporate the influence of the liquid diffusion over the surface .",
    "such a ddft model describes the coupled dynamics of the density fields of the liquid @xmath84 and the nanoparticles @xmath85 .",
    "the densities @xmath84 and @xmath85 are defined as the probabilities of finding a given lattice site on the surface to be occupied by a film of liquid or by a nanoparticle , respectively .",
    "note that the probability densities correspond to number densities as we use the lattice spacing @xmath86 as our unit of length .    to develop the ddft",
    ", one must first derive the underlying free energy functional @xmath87 $ ] , and secondly , devise dynamical equations for both density fields that account for the conserved and the non - conserved aspects of their dynamics , i.e. , transport and phase change processes , respectively .    for a system governed by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] )",
    ", we may construct a mean - field ( bragg - williams ) approximation for the free energy of the system @xcite which contains an entropic contribution and contributions from the interactions between the different species ( nanoparticles and liquid ) .",
    "the free energy is a semi - grand free energy , since the liquid is treated grand canonically ( it is coupled to a reservoir with chemical potential @xmath25 ) , whereas the nanoparticles are treated in the canonical ensemble .",

    "<S> we review recent experiments on dewetting thin films of evaporating colloidal nanoparticle suspensions ( nanofluids ) and discuss several theoretical approaches to describe the ongoing processes including coupled transport and phase changes . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches range from microscopic discrete stochastic theories to mesoscopic continuous deterministic descriptions . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on ( i ) a microscopic kinetic monte carlo model , ( ii ) a dynamical density functional theory and ( iii ) a hydrodynamic thin film model .    models ( i ) and ( ii ) are employed to discuss the formation of polygonal networks , spinodal and branched structures resulting from the dewetting of an ultrathin ` postcursor film ' that remains behind a mesoscopic dewetting front . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight , in particular , the presence of a transverse instability in the evaporative dewetting front which results in highly branched fingering structures . the subtle interplay of decomposition in the film and contact line motion </S>",
    "<S> is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss a simple thin film model ( iii ) of the hydrodynamics on the mesoscale . </S>",
    "<S> we employ coupled evolution equations for the film thickness profile and mean particle concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the model is used to discuss the self - pinning and de - pinning of a contact line related to the ` coffee - stain ' effect .    </S>",
    "<S> in the course of the review we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different theories , as well as possible future developments and extensions . </S>"
