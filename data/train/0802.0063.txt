    "the phenomenon of segregation , in which a homogeneous mixture of particles of different species becomes spatially non - uniform by sorting themselves in terms of their size and/or mass , is ubiquitous in numerous chemical and pharmaceutical industries , dealing with the transport and handling of bulk granular mixtures @xcite . for most industrial processes",
    ", it is required to maintain a homogeneous mixture during processing , with the segregation being the ` unwanted ' phenomenon . despite its unwanted consequences",
    ", however , segregation occurs spontaneously in driven granular mixtures @xcite .",
    "when a mixture of different particles is subjected to vertical shaking in a container , the larger particles ( intruders ) rise to the free surface .",
    "this is known as the _ brazil - nut phenomenon _",
    "( bnp ) , and is one of the most puzzling phenomena of granular materials research , still lacking a proper theoretical explanation .",
    "the early experimental investigations on the brazil nut phenomenon @xcite were mainly concentrated on the effect of size of the intruder particle in vibrated systems . besides experiments , computer simulations have been extensively used to study segregation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the current interest within the physics community on granular segregation was stimulated by the monte carlo simulations of rosato and co ",
    "workers @xcite .",
    "they explained bnp as a _",
    "percolation _ effect since the smaller particles can easily percolate down to fill the void , created behind the larger particles due to external shaking , which , in turn , pushes the larger particle to the top .",
    "however , we need to point out that such percolation effects are likely to be active in a dense bed only under weak - shaking conditions .    in many experimental setups",
    "convection is unavoidable @xcite and seems to be a key ingredient to drive segregation @xcite . in the regime of convection - driven segregation @xcite",
    ", it has been experimentally verified that the large particles rise with an _ upward - plume _ of the surrounding bed at the center of the container , but can not sink to the bottom since they are unable to fit themselves in a narrow _ downward - plume _ near the side - walls .",
    "it has subsequently been verified , via careful md simulations @xcite , that convection - driven segregation dominates ( over percolation ) in deep beds . in this scenario",
    "the intruder particles with different sizes rise at approximately the same rate @xcite .",
    "however , a regime where convection is negligible has also been found in some experiments @xcite as well as in many idealized simulations @xcite . the most striking observation in this case is the dependence of the segregation - rate on the particle - size , where the ascending velocity of the intruder particle increases with its size @xcite .",
    "it has been found that there is a _",
    "threshold size - ratio _ for the intruder above ( /below ) which the intruders rise ( /sink ) .",
    "a series of recent discoveries have shown that the brazil nut phenomenon is more intricate than it might seem .",
    "the subject took a major step forward with the papers of shinbrot and muzzio @xcite and hong , quinn and luding @xcite . in 1998 shinbrot and muzzio @xcite discovered a _",
    "reverse buoyancy _ effect : while a large heavy intruder rises to the free surface , an equally large but light intruder sinks to the bottom of the granular bed .",
    "three years later hong , quinn and luding @xcite introduced a phenomenological theory for the _ reverse brazil nut phenomenon _ ( rbnp ) : a competition between percolation and condensation , depending on the size and the mobility of the intruder particles , could drive the intruders to sink to the bottom of the container and vice versa .",
    "the key idea of this theory is that a mono - disperse system of particles can be fluidized above a critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) , assuming that the system is shaken uniformly .",
    "hence , if a binary mixture is vibrated such that the mixture temperature lies between the critical temperatures of two individual species , then one species will be in a fluidized state and the other condenses at the bottom , leading to segregation .",
    "immediately the subject attracted the attention of researchers who performed new experiments @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the segregation phenomenon , for example , percolation @xcite , arching @xcite , convection @xcite , inertia @xcite , condensation @xcite and interstitial - fluid effects @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , while the observational evidence accumulates @xcite , relatively little work exists on a unified theory for the dynamics of brazil nuts @xcite .",
    "recently , jenkins and yoon @xcite developed a theory for the segregation of elastic particles using hydrodynamics equations of binary mixtures .",
    "they investigated the upward - to - downward transition introduced in @xcite even though their prediction of the phase diagram for the bnp / rbnp - transition did not match with the simulation results of hong et al .",
    "interestingly , none of these early theories considered either the non - equipartition of granular energy ( which is a generic feature of granular mixtures ) or the effect of external driving forces .",
    "thus , it appears that a comprehensive theoretical description for the dynamics of brazil nuts is still lacking .",
    "a hydrodynamic model to include the effect of the non - equipartition of granular energy was postulated in ref .",
    "@xcite where a new mechanism for segregation due to buoyant forces was introduced , drawing a direct analogy with the buoyancy forces in fluids .",
    "more recently , a _",
    "minimal _ hydrodynamic model for segregation was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from the boltzmann - enskog - level continuum equations for a dense binary mixture of fluidized granular materials . the important effect of dissipation , which is responsible for the non - equipartition of the granular energy , was also incorporated .",
    "this latter work clearly shows how one could derive a time - evolution equation for the relative rise velocity of the intruder from first principles , thereby making the analogy with standard fluids transparent ( which has a history of more than a century , with the seminal works of stokes , oseen , boussinesq , etc ) .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bnp / rbnp segregation dynamics results from a competition between buoyancy and geometric forces .",
    "this analysis @xcite appears to be compatible with the experimental observations reported by breu _",
    "_ @xcite and also agrees with the molecular dynamics simulations reported by hong _",
    "_ @xcite .    in view of the good qualitative agreement of our model @xcite with the experimental observations presented by breu _",
    "@xcite , it is worth attempting to construct a theory for segregation in granular materials using the kinetic theory of inelastic hard particles .",
    "we show that a _ granular hydrodynamic _ theory does indeed provide a good description for the dynamics of brazil nut segregation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ kt ]",
    "we introduce the kinetic theory for inelastic hard particles , by summarizing the principal definitions of the model and presenting the balance equations for the mixture .",
    "the problem of the non - equipartition of kinetic energy is considered in [ ske ] .",
    "the main results of this paper are presented in section [ st ] , where the detailed theory for segregation is outlined . the evolution equation that governs the segregation dynamics of intruders in the dense collisional regime",
    "is outlined in [ sd ] .",
    "we then comment on the _ origin _ of different ` gravitational ' segregation forces derived from the model in section [ sf ] , followed by a discussion on the _ origin _ of the unsteady forces that act on the intruders in section [ usf ] . in section [ pd ]",
    "we discuss the phase - diagram for the bnp / rbnp transition in three - dimensions ( i.e. for spherical particles ) , thereby verifying that the competition between the buoyancy and geometric forces drives the segregation process in a fluidized mixture .",
    "in addition , we explain the _ reverse buoyancy effect _ of shinbrot and muzzio @xcite in section [ rb ] . in section [ dsi ]",
    "we apply our theory to probe the dynamics of intruders in the tracer limit , thereby explaining some recent experimental observations on the _ non - monotonic _ rise - time ( mbius et al .",

    "the conclusions and the limitations of our theory are detailed in section [ con ] .",
    "we assume that granular matter can be described at the ` macroscopic ' level by a set of continuous hydrodynamic equations as a fluid  mechanical medium .",
    "the balance equations and the constitutive relations can be derived from a kinetic theory description . for granular media the kinetic equations",
    "are modified to account for the inelastic nature of the collisions between particles@xcite .",
    "these equations have been extended to binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "the validity of the hydrodynamic approach even in the dense limit has recently been justified via a comparison of the theory with various experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies for binary granular mixtures have shown that the two components have different kinetic ( fluctuation ) energies @xcite which has also been confirmed in vibrofluidized experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , alam and luding @xcite have demonstrated that a proper constitutive model for granular mixtures must incorporate the effect of the non - equipartition of granular energy .",
    "therefore , in the present model we consider this breakdown of equipartition on the kinetic energy and this is a fundamental difference with previous related studies @xcite .",

    "for example , the thermal buoyancy force ( @xmath174 ) can be measured by measuring the granular energies ( @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) from the snapshots of successive particle configurations .",
    "these snapshots can also be used to measure the pair correlation function ( @xmath66 and hence the compressibility factor @xmath63 ) and the dynamic geometric force ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the other two forces ( @xmath304 and @xmath232 ) are then easily obtained .",
    "knowing all these forces from experiments , one could construct each term of our theory independently .",
    "we hope that the present investigation will stimulate future experiments to measure these quantities .",
    "one of our motivations has been to explore whether the hydrodynamic  description of granular materials can be applied to the derivation of a time ",
    "evolution equation for the segregation velocity of intruders in a dense fluidized bed .",
    "we have done that in our previous paper @xcite , starting from the kinetic - theory of binary mixtures .",
    "based on this time  evolution equation , here",
    "we have tried to provide a unified theoretical description for the segregation dynamics of brazil - nuts in a vibrated granular mixture .",
    "we have discussed a novel mechanism for segregation and argued that the onset of segregation is due to a competition between the _ buoyancy _ and _ geometric _ forces .",
    "apart from the standard archimedean buoyancy force , we have introduced the notion of a pseudo - thermal buoyancy force that results from the fact that the intruder particle fluctuates at a _",
    "different _ energy level than the smaller particles .",
    "( the microscopic dissipation , due to the inelastic nature of particle - collisions , is responsible for the non - equipartition of granular energy . )",
    "the size - difference between the intruder and the bed - material results in two geometric forces , one compressive and the other - one tensile in nature the net geometric force is always compressive .",
    "thus , the net buoyancy force competes with the net compressive geometric force , thereby deciding the onset of bnp / rbnp transition .    for a mixture of perfectly hard - particles with elastic collisions ,",
    "the pseudo - thermal buoyancy force is zero but the intruder has to overcome the net compressive geometric force to rise . for this case , the competition between the net geometric force and the archimedean buoyancy force yields a threshold density - ratio , @xmath0 , above which the _ lighter intruder sinks _",
    ", thereby signalling the _ onset _ of the _ reverse buoyancy _ effect . for a mixture of dissipative particles , on the other hand ,",
    "the non - zero pseudo - thermal buoyancy force gives rise to another threshold density - ratio , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , above which the intruder rises again .",
    "this theory is applied to study the dynamics of a single intruder ( i.e. in the tracer limit of intruders ) in a vibrofluidized granular mixture , with the effect of the base - plate excitation being taken into account through a ` mean - field ' assumption .",
    "the rise ( /sink ) time _ diverges _ near the threshold density - ratio for reverse - segregation .",
    "the most interesting result is that the rise - time of the intruder could vary _ non - monotonically _ with the density - ratio . for a given size - ratio ( in the zone of bnp ) , there is a threshold density - ratio for the intruder at which it takes maximum time to rise and above(/below ) which it rises faster .",
    "this implies that _ the heavier ( and larger ) the intruder , the faster it ascends _ ; a similar effect has been observed in some recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the peak on the rise - time curve decreases in height and shifts to a lower density - ratio as we increase the magnitude of the pseudo - thermal buoyancy force .",
    "the main message emerging from our analysis is that the pseudo - thermal buoyancy force that results from the non - equipartition of granular energy ( @xmath154 ) plays an important role in the segregation process .",
    "even though the source of this energy non - equipartition is inelastic dissipation , it can be argued that the effects of the bulk - convection will also lead to a separation between the granular energies of the intruder and the bed - particles even in the limit of perfectly elastic collisions .",
    "thus , the increased pseudo - thermal buoyancy force ( i.e. with increasing dissipation - levels in our model ) can also be related to the presence of the bulk - convective motion . in this connection",
    "it may be pointed out that a different functional form for the equation of state might change the precise threshold of segregation , but the presence of additional pseudo - thermal buoyancy force , for example , due to convection , is likely to retain the overall phase - diagram similar .",
    "it is remarkable that our theory can explain several experimental observations in a unified manner , despite having many simplifying assumptions .",
    "in addition to explaining the experimental results of breu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the reverse brazil - nut segregation , we have suggested a plausible explanation for the _ origin _ of the onset of the reverse - buoyancy effect of shinbrot and muzzio @xcite as well as the _ origin _ of the non - monotonic ascension - dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of air - pressure on the non - monotonic ascension - dynamics @xcite seems to be more subtle and needs further work . this can be done by considering a three - phase mixture , with separate balance equations for the air and taking into account the resulting interactions on both the smaller particles and the intruders .",
    "lastly , the effects of coulomb friction and the particle roughness need to be incorporated in our model in future .",
    "the work on ` reverse segregation ' was started when m.a .",
    "was a humboldt fellow at ica1 , stuttgart , and l.t .",
    "was a doctoral student at pmmh , espci , paris .",
