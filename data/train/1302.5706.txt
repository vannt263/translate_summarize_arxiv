    "tracking the values of the fundamental constants such as the proton to electron mass ration @xmath0 and the fine structure constant @xmath3 has been shown to be an effective way of discriminating between different mechanisms for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( @xcite , @xcite , hereinafter t12 and tmv13 ) .",
    "in particular rolling scalar field cosmologies where the rolling field also couples with the electromagnetic field predict changes in the values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "comparison of the predicted changes in @xmath0 with the observed constraints translates to equivalent constraints on the cosmologies and the new physics required by the cosmology .",
    "a new constraint on the change in @xmath0 at a redshift of 0.89 has just been published by @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath8 in the radio absorption spectrum of pks 1830 - 211 at a redshift of 0.88582 .",
    "this more than a factor of six improvement over the previous limit of @xmath9 in the same object @xcite and almost a factor of 4 improvement over the previous lower limit at a redshift of 0.6847 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 constraint is based on 4 methanol absorption lines observed with the 100 m effelsberg radio telescope .",
    "two of the absorption lines are normal rotational transitions while the two other transitions are mixed torsion - rotation transitions .",
    "the sensitivity constant @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 for the two pure rotational transitions is -1 while the two torsion - rotation transitions have sensitivity constants of - 7.4 and -32.8 .",
    "the differences in sensitivity constants provides a means of testing for a change in @xmath0 using transitions in a single molecular species rather than comparison between two or more molecular species .",
    "* the connection between rolling scalar fields and changes in the values of the fundamental constants has been considered for more than 10 years , eg .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . *",
    "it is assumed in most rolling scalar field cosmologies that the rolling scalar field @xmath2 is also coupled with the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this coupling then alters the values of the fundamental constants as the field changes with time ( rolls ) .",
    "this has been discussed by @xcite , hereinafter nl4 in the context of a linear coupling @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the coupling constant and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planck mass .",
    "the same physics applies to both @xmath0 and @xmath3 and the two are related by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the qcd scale , @xmath20 is the higgs vacuum expectation value and r is a scalar often considered to be on the order of -40 to -50 @xcite .",
    "nl4 further show the relationship between the rolling field and the equation of state parameter @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dark energy density . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate differentiation with respect to cosmic time and to @xmath26 respectively where @xmath27 is the scale factor of the universe . t12 and tmv13 then showed the relation between changing fundamental constants and the evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath28 for the case of the proton to electron mass ratio equation  [ eq - wmu ] establishes the connection between the product of a new physics parameter @xmath29 and a cosmological parameter @xmath30 such that @xmath31 where z is the redshift . * in creating figures  [ fig - thmplot ] and",

    "@xmath32^{-1}\\ ] ] *    the observational limits on @xmath33 therefore impose limits on the @xmath34 - @xmath30 parameter space that a rolling scalar field cosmology can live in .",
    "this parameter space was first discussed in t12 , however , the new methanol observation has greatly reduced the available parameter space .",
    "figure  [ fig - con ] shows the existing constraints on @xmath33 where the most stringent constraint for each object is indicated .",
    "the radio results are @xmath10 constraints while the optical constraints are @xmath35 measurements .",
    "all of the measurements are from the references in table 1 of t12 except for the new pks 1830 - 211 measurement by @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - con ] that the current radio results are the most restrictive in terms of @xmath33 and provide a condition at @xmath36 that must be satisfied by any cosmology",
    ".    figure  [ fig - thmplot ] shows the effect of the new measurement on the @xmath34 - @xmath30 parameter space along with the other radio restriction at @xmath37 @xcite and the most restrictive optical measurement at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the parameter space diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig - thmplot ] is similar to the equivalent diagram in t12 with different constraints .",
    "the shaded areas indicates the parts of the diagram that are forbidden .",
    "all of the area above the bottom line are forbidden at the redshift listed just above the line .",
    "all of the light shaded area and above is forbidden by the constraint on @xmath33 at @xmath39 and all of the shaded areas and above are forbidden by the new @xmath33 measurement at @xmath40 .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - thmplot ] indicates the expected lower limit on @xmath4 from new physics .",
    "* @xcite use the work of @xcite to set limits on the expected value of the coupling with the fine structure constant @xmath41 of @xmath42 . with the expected value of @xmath43 for r in eq .",
    "[ eq - amu ] this produces the expected range for @xmath44 of @xmath45 . the lower bound from @xcite was determined by setting @xmath46 , about a factor of 100 below the reported value of @xmath47 by @xcite .",
    "*    it is always possible to accommodate any value of @xmath30 by lowering the value of @xmath4 , and of course the standard model of physics expects @xmath4 to be zero .",
    "this , however , is a test of non - standard models with rolling scalar fields that do interact with the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - thmplot ] that if we set @xmath4 at it lowest expected value of @xmath48 then , at a redshift of 0.89 , the value of @xmath5 is very close to @xmath7 . since the value of @xmath49 is the difference between the value of @xmath0 today and its value at @xmath50 this implies that @xmath5 has been very close to @xmath7 for the entire time between now and @xmath50 unless the scalar field deviates from its value at @xmath50 and then returns to that value at the present time .",
    "most rolling scalar field models do not exhibit this behavior so they must conform to having @xmath5 close to @xmath7 for roughly half the age of the universe .",
    "to better quantify the restriction fig  [ fig - small ] shows an expanded view of the region near @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig - small ] indicates that if we hold to the lowest expected value of @xmath4 we must place the limit of @xmath6 for all redshifts of @xmath52 or less .",
    "this is an extreme restriction that puts the validity of current models of rolling scalar fields * that also couple with the electromagnetic field * as the driving force for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe in doubt .",
    "the results are , however , consistent with a @xmath53cdm universe and the standard model of physics .",
    "some areas for possible modification of the current rolling scalar field models are discussed in section  [ s - ar ] .",
    "the @xmath33 constraints at the various redshifts provide parameter space `` wickets '' through which valid cosmologies must pass .",
    "since all of the current `` wickets '' include the space where @xmath54 , @xmath53cdm with the standard model of physics clears all of them as do most modified gravity theories . rolling scalar field models with non - standard physics",
    "do not necessarily pass the test .",
    "tmv13 investigated some quintessence and k - essence models to determine the parameter space that fit the observations , where in this case the parameter space included those individual parameters that define the particular model such as an initial value of @xmath5 at a given value of redshift . in the following the models examined in tmv13",
    "are used with the new restriction and the same individual model parameters with only @xmath4 being varied to achieve a fit . as described in tmv13 the value of @xmath33 at any scale factor @xmath27",
    "is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 determined by the details of the particular cosmology .",
    "table 2 of tmv13 lists the values of the parameters used in each of the cosmologies .",
    "note that the matches will be slightly different in the individual cases than in the general case discussed above since in the general case we use equation  [ eq - omega ] for @xmath56 whereas in the individual cases we use the more accurate @xmath58^{-1}\\ ] ] figure 5 from tmv13 plots the values of @xmath59 versus redshift for the 4 cosmologies , slow roll quintessence , hilltop quintessence , non - minimal quintessence , and k - essence , and is repeated here as fig .",
    "[ fig - w ] for ease of reference .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - w ] that none of the three thawing cosmologies come close to satisfying the limit of @xmath6 at a redshift of @xmath52 .",
    "although not obvious from the scale of the plot even the freezing slow roll quintessence cosmology does not satisfy the constraint .",
    "since the constraints are in a parameter space that has both a cosmology and a new physics component , solutions can be sought in either area .",
    "the easiest is to simply adjust the new physics parameter @xmath4 downward , lower than the expected value , to open up the @xmath60 parameter space .",
    "the results of doing this are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - fit ] .",
    "the required value of @xmath4 needed to make all of the cases fit the constraints is shown in each figure . in some cases , such as k - essence",
    "the required value of @xmath4 is more than a factor of @xmath61 below the expected lower limit .",
    "quantitative and definitive new models for rolling scalar fields are beyond the scope of this paper and will be reserved for future papers .",
    "there are , however , obvious areas for modification which are discussed briefly below .      *",
    "the lower bound on @xmath4 as discussed in section  [ s - met ] is relatively arbitrary , therefore , the most straight forward method to recover viable rolling scalar field models is to simply reduce the value of @xmath4 by a factor on the order of 10 .",
    "this recovers most of the @xmath30 parameter space appropriate for reasonable cosmological models .",
    "this can be accomplished by either making the two terms in equation  [ eq - amu ] roughly equal to each other or by lowering the time variation of each of the terms .",
    "the former is equivalent to reducing the value of r while the latter reduces all of the coupling between the rolling scalar field and the electromagnetic field .",
    "further discussion of this point is beyond the scope of the present paper . *      @xcite",
    "use a simple linear form of coupling between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field ( equation  [ eq - dmu ] ) .",
    "this is quite reasonable given the lack of information on the true form of the coupling and can be considered as the first term in a taylor series expansion of the actual coupling .",
    "the coupling , however , may be of a quite different form which could lower the effect on the electromagnetic field from the expected range .",
    "the coupling has also been considered to be constant with time which may also be an erroneous assumption .",
    "the new limit on @xmath33 of @xmath62 by @xcite places significant constraints on rolling scalar fields as the origin of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the measured invariance of @xmath0 should be considered in the formulation of cosmologies invoking rolling scalar fields .",
    "current results are consistent with acceleration due to a cosmological constant @xmath53 and the standard model of physics . if the expected limits on the coupling constant @xmath4 are accepted then the invariance at a redshift of 0.89 implies that the value of the equation of state variable @xmath5 has been within @xmath63 of @xmath7 for the last half of the age of the universe . * if , however , the coupling between the rolling scalar field and the electromagnetic field is weaker than expected then the constraints on @xmath5 are significantly relaxed .",
    "this , on the other hand , has implications for new physics . *",
    "more accurate measurements of @xmath0 at higher redshift will be very useful in the further consideration of rolling scalar fields as the origin of the late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
