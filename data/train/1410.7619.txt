    "nested lattice coding for communication over gaussian networks has received considerable attention in recent times .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that nested lattice codes with closest lattice - point decoding can achieve the capacity of the power constrained additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel .",
    "they are also known to achieve the capacity of the dirty - paper channel  @xcite . inspired by these results ,",
    "they have been applied to design protocols for reliable communication over wireless gaussian networks .",
    "they have been used with much success for the interference channel  @xcite , the gaussian bidirectional relay channel  @xcite , and generalized to the problem of physical layer network coding  @xcite for multiuser gaussian channels .",
    "nested lattice coding has also been used for security in wiretap channels  @xcite and bidirectional relay networks  @xcite . for a more comprehensive treatment of lattices and their applications in communication problems ,",
    "see  @xcite",
    ".    constructing lattices that have good structural properties is a problem that has been studied for a long time .",
    "poltyrev  @xcite studied lattices in the context of coding for reliable transmission over the awgn channel without power constraints , and showed that there exist lattices which are `` good '' for awgn channel coding , i.e. , achieve a vanishingly small probability of error for all sufficiently small values of the noise variance .",
    "in addition to coding for the awgn channel , lattices were also studied in prior literature in the context of several other problems such as sphere packing , sphere covering , and mse quantization . in the sphere packing problem , we want to find an arrangement of non - intersecting spheres of a given radius that maximizes the average number of spheres packed per unit volume . on the other hand , the covering problem asks for an optimal covering of space by spheres of a given radius , that minimizes the average number of spheres per unit volume . in the mse quantization problem ,",
    "we want to find a minimal set of codewords which will ensure that the average mean squared error / distortion is less than a specified quantity .",
    "the use of lattices to generate good sphere packings , sphere coverings , and quantizers is a well - studied problem  @xcite .",
    "finding lattices with good stuctural properties is of particular importance in designing lattice codes that use nested lattice shaping for power constrained gaussian channels .",
    "a poorly designed shaping region leads to loss in transmission rates .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that using nested lattice codes , where the fine lattices are good for awgn channel coding ( in the sense of poltyrev s definition ) and the coarse lattices are good for mse quantization , we can achieve the capacity of the power constrained awgn channel .",
    "furthermore , the rates guaranteed by  @xcite for bidirectional relaying and the compute - and - forward protocol are achievable using nested lattices that satisfy the aforementioned properties .",
    "it was shown that if in addition to the above properties , the duals of the coarse lattices are also good for packing , then a rate of @xmath0 ( where snr denotes the signal - to - noise ratio ) can be achieved with perfect ( shannon ) secrecy over the bidirectional relay  @xcite .    instead of studying arbitrary lattices ,",
    "it is easier to study lattices that have a special structure , i.e. , lattices constructed by lifting a linear code over a prime field to @xmath1 .",
    "one such technique to obtain lattices from linear codes is construction a  @xcite , where the lattice is obtained by tessellating the codewords of the linear code ( now viewed as points in @xmath1 ) across the euclidean space .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that if we pick a linear code uniformly at random , then the resulting construction - a lattice is asymptotically good for covering , packing , mse quantization , and awgn channel coding with high probability .",
    "the problem with general construction - a lattices is the complexity of closest lattice - point decoding .",
    "there is no known polynomial - time algorithm for decoding construction - a lattices obtained from arbitrary linear codes . a natural way of circumventing this is to restrict ourselves to ldpc codes to construct lattices .",
    "we can then use low - complexity belief propagation ( bp ) decoders instead of the closest lattice - point decoder which has exponential complexity .",
    "such lattices , termed low - density construction - a ( lda ) lattices , were introduced in in  @xcite .",
    "simulation results in  @xcite showed that these lattices perform well with bp decoding . while there is no formal proof that these lattices are good under bp decoding , it was proved in  @xcite that lda lattices are good for awgn channel coding , and subsequently shown in  @xcite",
    "that nested lda lattices achieve the capacity of the power constrained awgn channel with closest lattice - point decoding . in this paper , we show that lda lattices have several other goodness properties .",
    "we will prove that a randomly chosen lda lattice ( whose parameters satisfy certain conditions ) is good for packing and mse quantization with probability tending to @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we will show that the dual of a randomly chosen lda lattice is good for packing with probability tending to @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the capacities of the power constrained awgn channel and the dirty paper channel , the rates guaranteed by compute - and - forward framework  @xcite , and the rates guaranteed by  @xcite for perfectly secure bidirectional relaying can all be achieved using nested lda lattices ( with closest lattice - point decoding ) .",
    "however , showing that the aforementioned results can all be achieved using belief propagation decoding still remains an open problem .",
    "even though other awgn - good lattice constructions that permit low - complexity decoding algorithms have been proposed  @xcite , this is the first instance where such a class of lattices have been shown to satisfy other goodness properties , and this is the main contribution of this work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe the notation and state some basic definitions in the next two subsections .",
    "section  [ sec : lda_ensemble ] describes the ensemble of lattices , and the main result is stated in theorem  [ theorem : lda_simultaneousgoodness ] .",
    "some preliminary lemmas are stated in section  [ sec : prelim_lemmas ] .",

    "channelcoding ] , the goodness of these lattices for channel coding is described .",
