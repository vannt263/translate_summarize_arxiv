    "david divincenzo put forward a low decoherence criterion for the candidates of quantum computing hardware to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "an approximate benchmark of the criterion is a fidelity loss no more than @xmath2 per elementary quantum gate operation . in general , the loss of the fidelity results from quantum leakage as well as decoherence .",
    "the josephson junction is considered to be a promising physical realization of the qubit .",
    "it has been shown that the quantum leakage of josephson charge qubit ( jcq ) is not serious @xcite .",
    "so it is very interesting to investigate the decoherence of the jcq . to perform the quantitative study of the decoherence for a qubit , in general one needs to solve the quantum dynamical problem of the qubit coupling with its environment",
    "however , the solutions of the coupling system can not be obtained easily , usually a kind of approximation must be appealed .",
    "the markovian approximation @xcite is the most familiar one .",
    "this approximation has been used to study the decoherence of qubits in last years @xcite prb68 - 060502 - 2003 .",
    "but it is not a suitable tool for researching the short - time decoherence of the qubits @xcite .",
    "however , the short - time processes is very important because almost all of the gate operations of the quantum devices are short time .",
    "fortunately , a short - time approximation scheme for the reduced density matrix has been developed recently privman .",
    "another core of the issue to investigate the decoherence of qubit is to make certain what the model of the environment and the coupling form of the qubit with its environment are . in general , according to the characteristic of the environment we set it a bosonic ( or fermi ) bath .",
    "the coupling of the qubit - bath can be supposed linear because the interaction between the qubit and the modes of the bath is very weak . under these suppositions ( linear coupling and short - time approximation ) , v. privman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite @xcite investigated the decoherence of many kinds of open systems and we also investigated a concrete jcq model in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinearly coupling forms of qubit - bath certainly exists physicae18 - 2003 - 29 . in this letter , we firstly introduce a model that jcq nonlinearly couples with its bath and then use the short - time approximation to investigate the decoherence of the jcq in the qubit - bath model .",
    "though the combined effects of the bath modes on the qubit may be large enough , the coupling of the qubit with each of the modes of the bath is very weak and the qubit - bath can be considered a linear coupling . however , due to the development of low temperature technique and fabrication technique of high quality quantum systems the nonlinearly coupling qubit - bath models can not be excluded in the devices of quantum .",
    "the linearly coupling qubit - bath model is analogous to the amplitude damping model . in this letter",
    ", we introduce a nonlinearly coupling qubit - bath model which corresponds to the phase damping model @xcite .",
    "we begin our investigation by considering a general open quantum system@xmath3here , @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the investigated quantum system ; @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the bath ; and @xmath6 describes the interaction of the system and the bath .",
    "the bath is traditionally modeled by a large number of uncoupled harmonic oscillators ( with ground energy shifted to zero),@xmath7if the interaction is linear , in the rotating - wave approximation the interaction hamiltonian is@xmath8with the interaction constants @xmath9 if the investigated system is a two - level system then @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the short - time decoherence of this model has been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "suppose the bath be ohmic then@xmath12where @xmath13 is the density of states of the bath and @xmath14 is the cutoff frequency .",
    "for the model of jcq coupling with the bath ( see fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) , the damping coefficient can be calculated with @xmath15where @xmath16 is the ( superconducting ) resistance quantum . when we investigate the short - time decoherence of this model , we can directly use @xmath17 and do not need solving @xmath13 then @xmath18    as well known that the interaction hamiltonian of a oscillator in the phase damping bath is @xcite @xcite@xmath19which is a nonlinear coupling .",
    "if we replace the oscillator with a two - level system , namely , @xmath20 @xmath21 then the total hamiltonian becomes@xmath22where @xmath23 and @xmath24 this hamiltonian models a kind of nonlinear coupling of the bath to the exposed qubit .",
    "this bath can be considered resulting from the fluctuations of the josephson nanocircuits and the surrounding circuits .",
    "a more general model which includes other sources of decoherence , such as quasiparticle tunneling , fluctuating background charges and flux noise has been put forward @xcite @xcite .",
    "suppose the bath is also ohmic then eq.([e4 ] ) will be held .",
    "but in this case , in order to investigate the decoherence of the qubit we must find out @xmath25 through solving @xmath26 .",
    "we suppose that the initial state of the environment state is @xmath27 which is the product of the bath modes density matrices@xmath28where @xmath29 because the degrees of freedom of the bath are much larger than that of the qubit , in the short time we can take the bath s states unchanged and consider the bath keeping in their thermal equilibrium state .",
    "we take the bath to be a mix of infinite harmonic oscillators at temperature @xmath30 thus , the density of state of the bath reads @xmath31for @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant . by using eq.([e4 ] )",
    "in this section we will investigate the general expression for the time evolution operator of the qubit in the nonlinear qubit - bath model within the short time .",
    "the definition of the short - time concept has been stated in ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite . the evolution operator is@xmath36 in the following we set @xmath37 due to non - conservation of @xmath38 in this system",
    ", the evolution operator can not be in a general way expressed as @xmath39 but in the sort - time approximation , the operator can be approximately expressed as split - operator01 @xcite@xmath40it has been proved that the expression is accurate enough for the time being short to the characteristic time .",
    "so the density matrix elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath41 in the basis of operator @xmath42 can be expressed as@xmath43here , we suppose that the initial state of the system is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial state of the qubit and @xmath46 . by using the completeness relation of the eigenstates of @xmath47 @xmath48",

    "in the following we shall study the short - time decoherence of the jcq .",
    "in order to investigate the decoherence of the qubits , one must designate the measure to be used .",
    "there are many choices for this purpose .",
    "when the evolution time is very long , the qubit interacting with the large bath will fall into the thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath74 . in this case , markovian type approximation can be used to quantify the decoherent processes and it usually yields the exponential decay of the density matrix elements in the energy basis of the hamiltonian @xmath75 in this time scale the measures of entropy and the first entropy can be used to quantify the decoherence .",
    "but the decoherence of the qubit gates can not be characterized by this methods because the time of the elementary quantum gate operations are much shorter than the thermal relaxation time .",
    "it has been shown that the norm @xmath76 is useful for describing the decoherence of the short - time evolutions . in this section , we will review the measure according to @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath77 is the deviation operator defined as@xmath78where @xmath41 and @xmath79 are density matrixes of the real  evolution ( with interaction ) and the ideal  one ( without interaction ) of the investigated system .",
    "@xmath80 is defined as @xmath81for a qubit , the norm can be given by@xmath82 in general , the norm @xmath76 increases with time , reflecting the decoherence of the system .",
    "however , it is oscillating at the system s internal frequency .",
    "thus , the decohering effect of the bath is better quantified by the maximal operator norm , @xmath83 which is defined as @xmath84it has been shown that the measure can rightly describe the short - time decoherence of qubits . in the following we will use this measure to investigate the short - time decoherence of jcq in nonlinearly coupling jcq - bath model .",
    "in this section we firstly review the jcq model .",
    "the single jcq hamiltonian is @xcite@xmath85here , @xmath86 is the charging energy ; @xmath87 is the josephson coupling energy , where @xmath88 is the critical current of the josephson junction , @xmath89 denotes the flux quantum ; @xmath90 is the dimensionless gate charge , where @xmath91 is the gate capacitance , @xmath92 the controllable gate voltage .",
    "when the josephson coupling energy @xmath93 is much smaller than the charging energy @xmath94 , and both of them are much smaller than the superconducting energy gap @xmath95 , the hamiltonian eq.([e28 ] ) can be parameterized by the number of the cooper pairs @xmath96 on the island as prl1997 @xcite@xmath97 \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{e29}\\end{aligned}\\]]when the temperature @xmath74 is low enough the system can be reduced to a two - state system ( qubit ) because all other charge states have much higher energy and can be neglected .",

    "three pure initial states are chosen , they are @xmath113 ( corresponding to points in the following figs . ) ; @xmath114 ( corresponding to above lines ) ; @xmath115 ( corresponding to below lines ) , [ because it has been shown that evaluation of the supremum over the initial density operators in order to find @xmath116 see eq.(e27 ) one can do over only pure - state density operators @xcite ] . here , the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath53 are@xmath117the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath118 are@xmath119thus , by using eq.([e23 ] ) we can obtain@xmath120@xmath121 ,   \\label{e36}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath122 in the following , we numerically investigate the decoherence of the jcq in this model .",

    "thus , we can plot the norms @xmath131 versus time @xmath105 in fig.1 .",

    "in this letter we firstly constructed a qubit - bath model where we supposed that the qubit nonlinearly couples with its environment . then using the model we investigated the short - time decoherence of the jcq .",
    "the decoherence is described by the norm of the deviation density operator , @xmath157 we define the biggest @xmath158 the quantity of decoherence @xmath112 . in the previous paper @xcite by using the same setup of the jcq and bath s parameters we calculated the decoherence of the jcq , where the jcq is supposed linearly coupling with its bath . in the linearly coupling model ,",
    "the decoherence is not larger than the divincenzo low decoherence criterion so the jcq can be taken as the qubit for quantum computations .",
    "however , the results of this letter show that at the same experimental temperature @xmath159 when the jcq nonlinearly couples with its bath , it is not a ideal block to build the quantum computer because the decoherence is larger than the divincenzo low decoherence criterion .",
    "but when the temperature decreases to @xmath160 the decoherence decreases to a endurable grade .",
    "it suggests that in order to make the jcq become a block of quantum computing hardware developing the technique of low temperature may be important .",
    "it should be noted that this is a pilot study to the decoherent problem of jcq .",
    "the frequencies of the harmonic oscillators of the bath modes are chosen tentatively .",
    "they may only be obtained by virtue of some ingenious experiments .",
    "a further numerical simulation shows that when the frequencies are larger than our setting the jcq will adapt a higher temperature .",
    "but , no matter what they are , we can find out a proper temperature for the jcq in low decoherence by using our method .",
