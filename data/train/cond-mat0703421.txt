    "the general subject of vortex physics in superconductors is quite interesting since there seems to be a large variety of possible equilibrium vortex phases in superconductors  .",
    "the term `` vortex matter '' has been coined to emphasize the complexity and diversity of vortex phases in superconductors when compared to atomic and molecular matter .",
    "one can think of a one to one correspondence between phases in atomic and molecular matter ( amom ) and phases in vortex matter ( vm ) .",
    "a liquid in amom corresponds to a vortex liquid in vm  @xcite ; a crystalline lattice in amom corresponds to a vortex lattice in vm  @xcite ; an amorphous or glassy solid in amom corresponds to an amorphous or glassy vortex system in vm  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a quasi - crystal is another very interesting state which has been experimentally discovered in amom  @xcite , but there are no corresponding experiments for vortex matter .    the possibility of vortex quasi - crystals was initially discussed several years ago  @xcite , but more recently quasi - periodic arrangements of vortices were discussed in the presence of underlying quasiperiodic pinning potentials  @xcite . in these recent theoretical and experimental studies it was suggested that the physical properties are quite unconventional due to the quasi - periodic pinning potentials . however , unlike these studies , the present paper is dedicated to a discussion of vortex quasi - crystalline phases in superconductors without quasi - periodic pinning potentials .",
    "this manuscript is an extension of our previous unpublished work  @xcite , where it was argued that vortex quasi - crystals maybe stabilized by boundary effects and surface energies in finite systems .",
    "the present situation is quite distinct from the case of quasi - periodic pinning of vortices  @xcite and from the case encountered in some atomic and molecular matter , where certain types of interactions can lead to colloidal quasi - crystals  @xcite .",
    "the central question of this manuscript is : under what conditions a quasi - crystalline arrangement of vortices is at all possible ?",
    "a definite possibility is to argue that a stable vortex quasi - crystal can arise from an imposed quasi - periodic potential like for instance in the case of a superconductor with quasi - periodic pinning potentials  @xcite , or in heterostructures consisting of a superconductor film grown on top of a quasi - crystal film .",
    "another possibility is to create a quasi - periodic optical lattice with laser beams , trap and cool atoms , and produce vortex quasi - crystals in bose or fermi superfluids .",
    "this experiment is natural since the production of vortex lattices in superfluid bose or fermi ultra - cold atoms has become standard  @xcite , and more recently square optical lattices were used to induce transitions between triangular and square vortex lattices using a mask technique  @xcite .",
    "thus , the generation of five - fold quasi - periodic optical lattices using a mask with five holes as the vertices of a regular pentagon ( or other methods ) may also be used to produce transitions between triangular and five - fold symmetric vortex lattices .    however , in this manuscript , we concentrate on the possibility of stabilizing vortex quasi - crystals only due to boundary effects in finite superconducting samples , where the sample size and shape play an important role .",
    "this option is motivated by recent experimental studies of the vortex structure in disk , triangular , square , and star - shaped mesoscopic samples  @xcite .",
    "these works provide us with the technology that allows the preparation of pentagonal ( pentagon - cylinders ) or decagonal ( decagonal - cylinders ) samples as potential candidates to produce 5-fold vortex quasi - crystals .",
    "furthermore , in these mesoscopic systems of cross - sectional area @xmath0 , the number of vortices @xmath1 is essentially given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the quantum of flux , and @xmath4 is the magnetic field",
    ". therefore samples with large upper critical field @xmath5 may produce a large enough number of vortices even the cross - sectional area is small , and the appearance of quasi - crystalline order is a definite possibility .",
    "for example , for a sample of cross sectional area @xmath6 and upper critical field at zero temperature @xmath7 , the number of vortices @xmath8 is quite substantial close to @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , since superconductors with large @xmath5 are usually associated with short coherence lengths , the vortex quasi - crystalline phase proposed is more likely to be observable in proper samples of short coherence length superconductors at high magnetic fields and low temperatures .    this possibility is considered here under the following program . in this manuscript only the case of an isotropic type ii superconductor in a magnetic field is considered .",
    "first , the bulk free energy is calculated for a triangular , a square and a 5-fold quasi - crystal array .",
    "the 5-fold quasi - crystal array is modeled by a penrose tiling of the plane as shown in fig .",
    "it is shown that the penrose tile array ( vortex quasi - crystal ) has a bulk free energy which is just a few percent higher than the triangular array .",
    "second , instead of considering an infinite ( bulk ) system , a pentagon cylinder sample is discussed .",
    "the pentagon cylinder has a pentagonal cross - section ( in the @xmath10 plane ) with side dimension @xmath11 , and with height @xmath12 along the @xmath13 direction . in this case , when the sample size gets smaller the contribution of the boundaries ( surface energy ) to the total free energy of the system becomes more important .",
    "the surface energy is highly sensitive to the symmetry and to the surface area of the boundaries .",
    "taking into account the surface free energies , it is shown that the penrose tiling ( vortex quasi - crystal ) has lower free energy than the triangular lattice in certain regions of the magnetic field versus temperature phase diagram .",
    "this is suggestive that a `` first order phase transition '' may occur between the triangular lattice and the penrose tiling ( vortex quasi - crystal )  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ginzburg - landau ] , we discuss a ginzburg - landau approach to obtain the free - energy of the triangular , square and penrose - tiling in the bulk . in section  [ sec : boundaries ] , we present the effects of pentagonal boundaries on the free energy of the triangular lattice and penrose - tiling , and obtain the critical magnetic field where the transition from triangular vortex lattice to a vortex quasi - crystal occurs . in section",
    "[ sec : thermodynamics ] , we discuss thermodynamic quantities like the change in magnetization and entropy , while in section  [ sec : neutron - scattering ] , we discuss neutron scattering , bitter decoration and scanning tunneling microscopy as possible probes to identify the quasi - crystalline structure .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we state our conclusions and summarize .     and 144@xmath14 ( thin lozenge ) and the other with internal angles 72@xmath14 and 108@xmath14 ( thick lozenge).,width=264 ]",
    "the starting point of our analysis to describe the vortex - quasicrystal state is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy density @xmath15 for a bulk isotropic superconductor with no disorder , where @xmath16 is the free energy density difference between the superconducting state @xmath17 and the normal state @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the penetration depth , @xmath25 is the coherence length , and @xmath26 is the unit flux . here ,",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 is the gl parameter .",
    "notice that when @xmath30 the system is fully superconducting , and when @xmath31 the system is normal , thus @xmath32 always . considering the minimization of free energy density with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "it is easy to arrive at equations for the dimensionless functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the microscopic field is @xmath37 - \\frac{g(x , y ) } { 2 \\kappa},\\ ] ] with @xmath38 parallel to the @xmath13 direction , and the equation for @xmath36 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a positive definite function .",
    "notice that @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath31 @xmath43 .",
    "the most general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : glinear ] ) has the form  @xcite @xmath44 \\exp \\left [ \\gamma(x , y ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath45 satisfies laplace s equation @xmath46 .",
    "this means that @xmath47 is a harmonic function excluding the locations of vortices , and can be expressed as the real part of an analytic function of @xmath48 .",
    "this observation has very important consequences for the microscopic field profile @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hsolution ] ) , which depends strongly on the structure of @xmath50 .",
    "the bulk gibbs free energy density is given by  @xcite @xmath51 where the parameter @xmath52 is a geometrical factor independent of @xmath53 .",
    "the notation @xmath54 indicates average over volume .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath55 no matter what is the form of @xmath50 because of the schwartz inequality .",
    "in addition , notice that the gibbs free energy above is a minimum , whenever @xmath56 reaches its minimum value .    for the purpose of calculating the parameter @xmath56 and the free energies corresponding to different vortex configurations , the analytical structure of @xmath50 in the complex plane",
    "is used to rewrite it as @xmath57 where @xmath58 . here , each @xmath59 corresponds to a zero of @xmath60 in the complex plane , and @xmath61 is the number of zeros .",
    "the zeros @xmath59 indicate the location of vortices . from now on it is assumed that there is only one vortex with flux @xmath3 at each position @xmath59 , i.e. , each zero is non - degenerate . in this case",
    ", @xmath61 corresponds to the number of vortices , and thus the total flux threading the sample is @xmath62 .",
    "the normalization coefficient @xmath63 just guarantees that @xmath64 . depending on the locations of the zeros of @xmath65 , it is possible to study several possibilities of periodic and quasi - periodic vortex arrangements . in this study",
    "only vortex crystals corresponding to triangular and square lattices and vortex quasi - crystals corresponding to the 5-fold penrose tiling of the plane are considered .",
    "both the square lattices and triangular lattices can be generated via the tiling method , i.e. , via the periodic arrangements of identical square tiles or identical lozenges of internal angles ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "the penrose lattice , however , requires quasi - periodic arrangements of two types of tiles ( lozenges ) , one with internal angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the other with internal angles @xmath70 and @xmath71 . using the representation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gzzbar ] ) , the values of @xmath56 for the triangular , square and penrose tiling are respectively @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this immediately indicates that the triangular lattice has lower free energy than the square lattice which has lower free energy than the 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal ( penrose tiling ) , as expected .",
    "however , the fact that the free energy difference between the triangular and 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal is only a few percent suggests that appropriate boundaries can favor 5-fold symmetry as the sample size gets smaller , as can appropriately imposed quasi - periodic potentials .",
    "thus next , we discuss boundary effects and the magnetic field versus temperature phase diagram .",
    "in order to investigate how boundary effects can modify the total free energy of the system , a sample in the shape of a pentagon cylinder of side @xmath11 and height @xmath12 is considered . imposing that no currents flow through the sample boundaries leads to the condition @xmath75 \\psi(x , y ) = 0\\ ] ] at all five side faces .",
    "the unit vector @xmath76 points along the normal direction of each facet of the pentagon cylinder .",
    "the boundary conditions can be translated in terms of the harmonic function @xmath47 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the @xmath80 and @xmath81 components of the normal unit vector @xmath76 at each one of the pentagon cylinder side faces .",
    "the solution for this boundary value problem can be obtained using a schwarz - christoffel conformal map of the pentagon into a semi - infinite plane @xmath82 where the vertices of the pentagon located at @xmath83 are mapped into the points @xmath84 on the real axis of the @xmath85-plane .",
    "the full solution of this problem is complicated , and requires heavy use of numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "however , the free energy density can be estimated when the bulk solution in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gzzbar ] ) is treated as a variational solution of the boundary value problem determined by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : glinear ] ) , ( [ eqn : bound - gamma ] ) and ( [ eqn : sc - transf ] ) .",
    "the gibbs free energy density difference @xmath86 between the triangular and the 5-fold quasi - periodic penrose structure then becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the thermodynamic critical field , and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . the effective length of the sample @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the golden mean . here , @xmath96 corresponds to the radius of the circle that circumscribes the pentagonal sample .",
    "this expression for @xmath97 is valid only when @xmath98 .",
    "the second term in @xmath97 takes into account the boundary mismatch energy , and indicates that as the size of the pentagon cylinder gets smaller it becomes more favorable to have a 5-fold quasi - crystal rather than a regular triangular lattice .",
    "notice , however , that when @xmath99 the triangular lattice has lower gibbs free energy as it must , and no transition to a 5-fold quasi - crystal occurs . thus , this possible transition may occur for finite sized samples only . from the condition that @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101,\\ ] ] where the transition to a quasi - crystal occurs . here , @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig:1].,width=264 ]    in addition to magnetization measurements , it is also interesting to perform calorimetric experiments .",
    "however , specific heat measurements are very difficult because they require large samples . since sample size is important for the present discussion it is not clear that such experiments can be successfully performed .",
    "nevertheless , the thermodynamic relationship between the magnetization and entropy jumps is revealed in the clapeyron equation @xmath126 since @xmath127 , and @xmath124 implies that @xmath128 , the entropy @xmath129 of the triangular vortex lattice is less than the entropy @xmath130 of the 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal , indicating that latent heat @xmath131 is required to cause this phase transition .",
    "thermodynamic quantities can provide a good understanding of properties averaged over the entire sample , and can characterize the signature of the crystal - quasicrystal phase transition .",
    "however , as discussed above , a good measurement of these quantities may require an array of identical samples , which introduces experimental complexity and difficulty .",
    "as another possibility , the use of local probes discussed next is much desired in order to reveal the change in structure from a triangular vortex crystal to a 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal .",
    "for instance , neutron scattering , bitter decoration or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments may help elucidate the structure of the vortex arrangement in mesoscopic samples .",
    "in neutron diffraction experiments periodic or quasi - periodic variations of @xmath49 will result in bragg peaks .",
    "the position of these peaks determine the characteristic length scale of the vortex structure and its symmetry .",
    "the neutron scattering amplitude in the born approximation is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the neutron magnetic moment and the @xmath134 is the neutron mass .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath135 is directly proportional to the fourier transform @xmath136 [ @xmath137 of the microscopic field @xmath138 [ @xmath139 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hsolution ] ) .",
    "the neutron scattering cross section @xmath140 has sharp peaks at @xmath141 ( central peak ) and at @xmath142 ( first bragg peaks ) , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 , with @xmath145 . for the triangular lattice",
    "@xmath146 the first bragg peak occurs at @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the lattice spacing . for the 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal ( penrose lattice , @xmath149 )",
    "the first bragg peak occurs at @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the side of a tile .",
    "since the sample size is important for the observation of a 5-fold quasi - crystal , neutron scattering experiments may be difficult to perform .",
    "however , bitter decoration might be a useful technique if magnetic nanoparticles could be used to decorate the magnetic field profile , and then be seen by a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) ( magnetic or non - magnetic ) .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to use just an stm to scan over the pentagonal sample and probe the local density of states which is substantially different inside and outside of vortex cores , due to the presence of vortex cores states . in this case",
    ", it may be also useful to make a periodic pattern of pentagonal samples , to obtain an ensemble average .",
    "it should be possible as well to perfom stm scans at different fields and temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath152 , which would reveal the real space locations of vortices .",
    "the pattern obtained could then be fourier transformed ( ft ) to obtain a 6-fold pattern for the triangular vortex lattice and a 10-fold pattern for the 5-fold vortex quasi - crystal ( penrose lattice ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fivefold ] .        now that the phase diagram , thermodynamics , and the local signatures of a vortex quasi - crystal have been discussed , it is important to say a word on the stability of such structures .",
    "a stability analysis in the free energy can be performed by moving the vortices away from their equilibrium positions @xmath59 to @xmath153 .",
    "the eigenvalues associated with these displacements indicates that for @xmath154 the vortex quasi - crystal lattice is stable , and therefore potentially realizable in mesoscopic samples .",
    "before concluding , we would like to make several comments in connection with the approximations used and the observability of the vortex quasi - crystal phase discussed .",
    "first , it should be emphasized that our free energy analysis provides a preliminary understanding of the vortex quasi - crystal phase , but further detailed numerical work is necessary .",
    "for instance , the vortex quasi - crystal sitting on a penrose lattice is only one possible state in a pentagon superconducting sample .",
    "although we have shown that this state has lower free energy than a triangular or rectangular lattice , we can not rule out other possibilities based on the present calculation .",
    "second , since there is no full compatibility of the 5-fold penrose lattice with the pentagon cylinder geometry , the appearance of disclinations and dislocations is possible . as a result",
    "there is an additional possibility of a solid ( crystal or quasi - crystal ) vortex structure in the center of the sample , which melts or gets disordered at the sample boundaries  @xcite .",
    "third , the number of vortices in superconducting samples is restricted by @xmath155 , which means that for superconductors with high @xmath5 a large number of vortices is possible .",
    "one can make a simple estimate for @xmath156 by using the ginzburg - landau relation @xmath157 , leading to @xmath158 ^ 2 $ ] . for conventional type ii superconductors ,",
    "the number @xmath156 is only about @xmath159 , thus the thermodynamic limit and hence the definition of the quasi - crystal phase is questionable .",
    "however , for materials with short coherence length ( and large upper critical fields ) , such as high-@xmath160 superconductors , where @xmath161 is about @xmath159 , then @xmath156 can be as large as @xmath162 , and the quasi - crystalline structure can be well defined and observed .",
    "thus , the observation of a vortex quasi - crystal state is more likely to occur in short coherence length superconductors at low temperatures and high magnetic fields .",
    "finally , strong disorder in the sample can also destroy the quasi - crystal structure due to the pinning of vortices , however , clean mesoscopic superconducting materials already exist and shell structures have been observed for niobium samples of @xmath163 sizes  @xcite .",
    "thus , we suspect that experimentally this should not be an issue as vortex lattices ( triangular ) are routinely observed in reasonably clean superconducting samples .",
    "therefore , the choice of pentagonal mesoscopic samples of superconductors with sufficiently large @xmath5 should allow for the observation of the vortex quasi - crystal state .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that vortex quasi - crystals may be experimentally observed in mesoscopic samples of type ii superconductors with large upper critical fields ( short coherence lengths ) . by taking into account boundary effects , sample shape and size , we proposed that a first order phase transition occurs between a vortex crystal and a vortex quasicrystal , as magnetic field and temperature are varied ."
