    "acceptable theories of structure formation are those whose parameters have been tuned to match the most up - to - date cosmological observations . at high redshift ,",
    "the current leading constraint on models is the data from cobe ( @xcite ) , which fixes the amplitude of the power spectrum on very large scales ( @xmath11mpc ) to an accuracy of about 12% . at low ( essentialy zero ) redshift , we demand that models fit current observations of our local universe , primarily those concerning the distributions of galaxies in @xmath12 space .",
    "these include the abundance of clusters of galaxies , which fixes the amplitude of the power spectrum on scales of @xmath13mpc to about 10% accuracy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; pen 1996 ) , the power spectrum of galaxies , which constrains the shape of the power spectrum on the intermediate - to - large scale of @xmath14mpc ( peacock & dodds 1994 ; feldman , kaiser & peacock 1994 ) , the ratio of gas to total matter in galaxy clusters , which determines @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the current measurements of the hubble constant ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1993 ; freedman 1994 ; @xcite ; hamuy 1995 ) and the age constraint from the oldest globular clusters ( bolte & hogan 1995 ) limit the range for @xmath16 and the combination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    this observational suite has been examined by ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) to constrain flat cold dark matter models with a non - zero cosmological constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the exercise is repeatable for other models ( not necessarily flat ) including the tilted cold dark matter model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the mixed dark matter model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the open cold dark matter model ( gott 1982 ; bucher , goldhaber , & turok 1995 ) and the primeval isocurvature baryon model ( peebles 1987a , b ; cen , ostriker , & peebles 1993 ) . the allowed parameter space for the family of gaussian cosmological models with the tunable parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , r@xmath19",
    ", @xmath20 , iso , adia ) is thus quite limited . in this context ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the hubble constant , the density parameter , and the value of cosmological constant , all in the present epoch .",
    "r@xmath19 is the mass ratio of hot to cold matter , @xmath20 is the asymptotic power spectral index on large scales , and iso and adia denote isocurvature and adiabatic models . although it is possible to further tighten this parameter space simply by making more accurate observations of the forementioned quantities , we should not overlook any other _ independent _ tests which could help to distinguish between contending models .",
    "the @xmath0 forest lines observed in the spectra of high redshift quasars have two unique qualities which distinguish them from other observationally accessible phenomena , at redshifts between the epoch observed by cobe and our local universe .",
    "first , each line of sight indiscriminately samples the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas over a wide redshift range ( @xmath21 ) along random lines of sight ( i.e. , foreground objects are unrelated to the background quasar ) .",
    "second , each individual spectrum contains a large amount of information about low absorption regions ( e.g. voids , fluctuating gunn - peterson absorption ) as well as information from high absorption `` cloud '' lines ( number densities of clouds at different redshifts , @xmath22-parameters of the individual clouds , correlations of the clouds , relationship with other cosmic entities ) . with a database of thousands of observed quasars ,",
    "the total amount of information available is very large , allowing for very detailed statistical studies ( e.g. , carswell 1991 ; rauch 1993 ; petitjean 1993 ; schneider 1993 ; cristiani 1995 ; hu 1995 ; tytler 1995 ) .",
    "these facts , taken together , suggest that the @xmath0 forests constitute perhaps the most rich and unbiased sample available for studying the universe at moderate redshift .",
    "recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by several independent groups have consistently shown that @xmath0 clouds are an integral part of the cosmic structure , resulting naturally from the gravitational growth and/or collapse of density fluctuations on small - to - intermediate scales of @xmath23 kpc to a few mpc in comoving units ( cen 1994 , cmor hereafter ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "several simple population models have been designed to examine the ( local ) physical as well as ( global ) statistical properties of @xmath0 clouds ( sargent 1980 ; ostriker & ikeuchi 1983 ; ikeuchi & ostriker 1986 ; bahcall & spitzer 1969 ; arons 1972 ; rees 1986 ; ikeuchi 1986 ; bond , szalay , & silk 1988 ) . one of the essential simplifications in almost all these models is to assume that individual @xmath0 clouds are spherical .",
    "while the clouds produced in the new simulations may have some physical properties in common with these simple models , a visual inspection of the new simulation results reveals that the @xmath0 absorbing structures resulting from small - to - intermediate scale structure formation at high redshift are _ far from spherical_. furthermore , they seem to have a wide range of sizes .",
    "we presented these results first in cmor , and then in much more detail in miralda - escud ( 1996 , mcor hereafter ) . here , we present a quantitative study of the topological aspects of the @xmath0 clouds , complementing the topics covered in cmor and mcor .    in the redshift range from two to four ,",
    "@xmath0 clouds exhibit a rich spectrum of structure , ranging in shape from semi - spherical to filamentary and even sheet - like .",
    "the spherical structures often reside at density maxima ( with @xmath24@xmath6 ) located in the centers of extended structures , while the filaments and sheets tend to have a low @xmath25 ( @xmath26@xmath6 ) , and form a web - like , interconnecting network covering large portion of the simulation box ( @xmath27mpc comoving ) .",
    "we also show that it is not unusual for pairs of quasar sightlines to contain absorption features at close wavelengths .",
    "in particular , we show that `` common '' absorption features ( coincident lines ) in sightline pairs separated by @xmath28 proper kpc or more are probably due to absorption by _",
    "different clouds _ , while on separations smaller than @xmath29kpc , double sightlines are mostly likely to actually pierce a common cloud .    finally , we show that @xmath0 clouds are spatially significantly clustered , with a correlation length of roughly @xmath30mpc comoving ( for the high column density clouds of @xmath5@xmath6 ) at redshift @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests the possibility of an intriguing connection to faint blue objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some brief descriptions of the simulations ( for more details see mcor ) and our cloud identification method are presented in  2 . results and conclusions",
    "are given in  3 and  4 .",
    "we simulate the formation of @xmath0 clouds in a spatially flat cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath32cdm ) , using the following cosmological parameters : @xmath33km / s / mpc , @xmath34 , @xmath2 , @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "walker 1991 ) , @xmath3 ( the simulations we use in this paper are the same as those used in cmor and mcor ) .",
    "the primary motivation for choosing this model is that it best fits the available observations which were summarized in the introduction .",
    "the simulation box size is @xmath36 comoving mpc per side , and contains @xmath37 cells and @xmath38 dark matter particles .",
    "the cell size is @xmath39 comoving kpc , corresponding to a average baryonic cell mass of @xmath40 , with the true spatial and mass resolutions being about 2 and 8 times worse than those values , respectively . at @xmath41 ,",
    "the jeans length , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , is equal to @xmath44 in comoving units , or 11 cells .",
    "the power spectrum transfer function is computed using the method described in cen , gnedin , & ostriker ( 1993 ) .",
    "we use a new shock - capturing total variation diminishing ( tvd ) cosmological hydrodynamic code described in ryu ( 1993 ) .",
    "all the atomic processes for a plasma of ( h , he ) of primeval composition ( 76%,24% ) in mass are included , using the heating , cooling , and ionization terms described in cen ( 1992 ) .",
    "we calculate self - consistently the average background photoionizing radiation field as a function of frequency , assuming the radiation field is spatially uniform ( i.e. , optically thin ) .",
    "the evolution of the radiation field is calculated given the average attenuation in the simulated box and the emission ( both from the gas itself and from the assumed sources of ionizing photons ) .",
    "the time - dependent equations for the ionization structure of the gas are solved by iteration using an implicit method , to avoid the instabilities that arise in solving stiff equations . in general , the abundances of different species are close to ionization equilibrium between recombination and photoionization after most of the gas has been photoionized .",
    "we model galaxy formation as in cen & ostriker ( 1992 , 1993a , b ) .",
    "the material turning into collisionless particles as  galaxies \" is assumed to emit ionizing radiation , with two types of spectra : one characteristic of star formation regions and the other characteristic of quasars , with efficiencies ( i.e. , the fraction of rest - mass energy converted into radiation ) of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we adopt the emission spectrum of massive stars from scalo ( 1986 ) and that of quasars from edelson and malkan ( 1986 ) .",
    "details of how we identify galaxy formation and follow the motions of formed galaxies have been described in cen & ostriker ( 1993a ) .",
    "note that in this simulation supernova energy feedback into the intergalactic medium from aging massive stars is not included .",
    "perhaps the most critical decision which must be made in a study such as this is how to define a @xmath0 `` cloud '' .",
    "this is not as simple as it may seem , because the smooth transition in density between the global intergalactic medium and the local structures within it can blur the distinction between actual clouds and the intercloud medium .",
    "however , in order to examine the structure of @xmath0 clouds in any quantitative way , it is absolutely necessary to adopt some sort of definition of the boundary of a cloud .",
    "the simplest approach which we believe to be meaningful is to identify clouds as regions with densities above a chosen threshold .",
    "there are two major motivations for defining our clouds in this manner .",
    "first of all , this method allows us to associate the clouds found at each density cut with a particular column density , once we obtain information about the characteristic sizes of the clouds .",
    "this is a desirable feature because we can only observe @xmath0 forest clouds through absorption lines in qso spectra .",
    "second , density perturbations with amplitudes larger than a certain threshold become self - gravitating , bound clouds . for a spherical cloud , the average overdensity at which a cloud breaks away from the general hubble expansion and becomes self - gravitating is @xmath47 .",
    "thus , our cloud defintion also has physical motivation in that structures above some high density threshold are gravitationally bound , distinct systems .",
    "having chosen a general strategy for defining our clouds , we now describe the details of the grouping procedure .",
    "cells with a baryonic density below a chosen value ( 3,10 , and 30 will be used ) in units of the global mean of the baryonic density are cut out of the original density array .",
    "then , clouds are defined by grouping the remaining cells using the denmax scheme ( @xcite ) as follows .",
    "first , two sets of baryonic densities are stored .",
    "one is the original density output array from the simulation ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 elements ) , and the second is a smoothed version of @xmath48 with a gaussian smoothing window of radius 1.5 cells ( @xmath50 , @xmath49 elements ) .",
    "the smoothing is performed to eliminate any small , cell - to - cell density fluctuations , which could be physical in the form of small discontinuities or oscillating sound waves , or just numerical noises .",
    "such small - scale fluctuations could result in the identification of small unwanted clouds with sizes on the order of one cell . at the same time , since the true resolution of the simulation is close to 2 - 3 cells , a gaussian smoothing window of radius 1.5 cells should preserve all information regarding `` real '' adjacent structures . a larger smoothing window could merge real and separate entities which are actually well - resolved in the simulation .",
    "we have made rather extensive experiments on the smoothing operation and conclude that the adopted smoothing window size is appropriate , as will be shown below .    after the smoothing operation is performed , we cut out all elements of @xmath50 and @xmath48 whose @xmath48 values are below a chosen value , @xmath51 .",
    "we then collect the uncut cells of @xmath48 ( using the denmax scheme ) by propagating each cell along the gradient of @xmath50 until it reaches a local density maximum .",
    "all the cells collected at a particular local maximum are grouped into one  cloud \" .",
    "once the cells have been grouped , we examine the shapes and sizes of the resultant  clouds \" by approximating them as _ ellipsoids_. a symmetric @xmath52 moment tensor is created for each cloud of the form @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; @xmath55 and so on .",
    "this tensor is diagonalized , and the square roots of the eigenvalues yield the lengths of the semi - major and semi - minor axes , @xmath56 , in descending order of length . for cells",
    "where @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , we account for the finite size of a single cell by finding @xmath60 for a 1 cell square and adding that to the tensor component for a particular cloud .",
    "this method underestimates the actual axial lengths of an ellipsoid , because it only computes moments .",
    "we attempt to correct this by scaling up the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( determined above ) by a factor of @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the actual volume of the cloud computed by summing over all the member cells of the cloud .",
    "we first present a three dimensional visual description of the structure of the @xmath0 clouds produced in the simulation .",
    "figures ( 1a , b , c ) display the isodensity contour surfaces at @xmath41 for @xmath66 , respectively . here , @xmath51 is the baryonic density in units of its global mean .",
    "the box size is @xmath36 comoving mpc .",
    "the most striking visual feature is the network of sheets and filaments spanning the box . in figure",
    "1a we see that most of the structures are connected over the entire box , and it is apparent that most of the covering areas [ i.e. , cross section for quasar lines of sight at low column densities ( @xmath26  @xmath6 ; see below ) ] are sheet - like objects .",
    "although this result is for the particular @xmath32cdm universe simulated here , we expect this qualitative picture to be fairly generic for any cdm - like model ( hdm - like models should show even more prominent sheets , while models like pbi are likely to be less coherent ) . at a higher density of @xmath67 ( figure 1b )",
    "most structures become filamentary and more isolated .",
    "when the isodensity reaches @xmath68 ( figure 1c ) , most of the filaments are replaced by relatively round systems , which are typically isolated with separations of about one comoving megaparsec .",
    "the second noticeable visual feature is the existence of a large , low density region at the center of the box , occupying more than half of the simulation volume .",
    "since the initial condition of the simulation is not constrained ( i.e. , it is only a random realization of the cosmological model in such a volume ) , this void indicates that the simulation box may still not be large enough to contain a  fair \" volume for the structures under consideration .",
    "it may be necessary to use a larger simulation box , perhaps @xmath69mpc on a side , in order to properly sample the objects in question .",
    "different properties will be affected by the simulation volume to varied degrees .",
    "we expect that the most significant differences will be in quantities like void sizes , or correlations .",
    "let us now examine the individual clouds to assess the general accuracy of our grouping scheme .",
    "figure 2a shows clouds at @xmath70 for two randomly selected slices of size @xmath71mpc@xmath72 with thickness of @xmath73kpc ( all lengths are in comoving units ) at @xmath41 .",
    "the two left panels show the density contours of levels @xmath74 , and the two right panels show the identified @xmath0 clouds in the same slices .",
    "two symbols are used to show two types of clouds : the filled dots represent  large \" clouds with the dot size roughly proportional to the actual size of the cloud , and the open circles are for the  small \" clouds .",
    "a cloud is called  small \" if its smallest axis does not exceed 3 cells in length , and  large \" if it does .",
    "figure 2b is similar to figure 2a , but with @xmath67 , and for two different slices .",
    "we note that  large \" clouds are typically embedded in larger , extended density structures while  small \" ones are more isolated . a close",
    ", one - by - one examination of the density maxima in the density contour plots indicates that each identified cloud corresponds to a well defined density maximum ( some clouds , especially ",
    "small \" ones , have no corresponding density maxima simply because their densities fall below the contour levels when averaged over the slice thickness to be displayed ) .",
    "it appears that our smoothing operation and cloud identification scheme indeed yield well defined , distinct clouds with one particularly desirable feature : they are neither over - merged in the sense that a single cloud contains multiple structures of comparable size ( over - smoothed ) , nor over - separated in the sense that artificial clouds are created by small - scale small - amplitude density fluctuations ( undersmoothed ) .",
    "when the clouds are classified into  large \" and  small \" groups , we find that most of the clouds are ",
    "small \" : the fraction of  small \" clouds at @xmath66 at @xmath41 is ( @xmath75 ) , containing ( @xmath76 ) of the total cloud mass .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of the baryonic mass is in  small \" clouds indicates that a _ higher resolution simulation is perhaps needed _ before we can be absolutely sure that these clouds are resolved properly .",
    "inclusion of more initial small scale power , which is limited by the nyquist frequency of a simulation , might further increase the fraction of  small \" clouds .",
    "we note in passing that we also experimented with the conventional friends - of - friends grouping algorithm , with a linking length of one cell .",
    "the resulting clouds were obviously not useful for our analyses .",
    "for example , at @xmath70 , most of the volume , as well as mass , wound up in a single supercloud because the distinct clouds as shown in figure 2 were linked together by touching boundaries . in other words , the friends - of - friends grouping scheme picks out large , inter - connected networks ( see figure 1a ) but not the individual structures embedded within them .      we have chosen to focus on three quantitative aspects of the identified @xmath0 clouds : their sizes , shapes , and correlations .",
    "in addition , double quasar sightline analysis is performed .    to facilitate quantitative discussions ,",
    "we relate the mass density of a cloud to its column density . assuming that the clouds are in photoionization equilibrium , the column density of a cloud can be related to the parallel size and density of the cloud ( assuming that the density is uniform across the cloud along the line of sight ) as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the baryonic density parameter , @xmath79 the temperature in kelvin , @xmath80 the hydrogen photoionization rate , @xmath81 and @xmath82 the baryonic density of the cloud and the mean baryonic density at the redshift in question , @xmath83 the proper size of the cloud along the line of sight , and @xmath84 the redshift . for a photoionization radiation field with power - law form @xmath85 , @xmath86  sec@xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the intensity of the photoionization field at the lyman limit in the usual units ( @xmath89erg / cm@xmath72/hz / sec / sr ) . taking @xmath91 , @xmath92sec@xmath87 , @xmath93  kelvin , @xmath94  kpc as typical values at @xmath41",
    ", one finds that @xmath95 for @xmath66 . of course , exact column densities would depend on exact values of the assumed quantities as well as the actual density distribution .",
    "we expect that the actual density distribution , which is non - uniform , will increase the column densities .",
    "for example , redistribution of the same mass within @xmath83 into a ( one dimensional ) coreless , non - uniform one would result in a column density @xmath96 times that of the uniform density distribution , where @xmath97 is the slope of the density profile .",
    "we simply increase the above estimates by a factor of four to account for the gradient in the density distribution of a cloud [ note that this factor of four is fairly plausible for a reasonable @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) in the one dimensional singular case or a relatively lower @xmath97 value for a non - singular profile .",
    "we also note that this factor of four can also be achieved if @xmath78 is twice the value adopted here , in the light of recent new measurements on the deuterium abundance ( @xcite ) ] , thus obtaining @xmath99 we will use the above relation for quantitative discussions .      before engaging in a more detailed quantitative discussion of cloud properties , we present a few simple , global quantities . listed in table 1",
    "are the numbers of clouds at each redshift and density threshold , the baryonic mass fraction of such clouds , the mean inter - cloud separation in proper units , and the mean cloud mass .",
    "two points are interesting .",
    "first , while the average cloud increases its mass by a factor of about @xmath100 from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , the number of clouds decreases by a factor two .",
    "this indicates that the merging of old clouds and creation of new clouds are of comparabe importance .",
    "second , the fraction of baryonic mass contained in @xmath0 clouds is large . for example , at redshifts ( 2,3,4 ) , ( 31% , 29% , 26% ) of baryons are found in regions with densities between @xmath70 and @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath103@xmath6 ) .",
    "we define the characteristic  size \" of a cloud as    @xmath104    where @xmath105 , @xmath22 , and @xmath106 are the semi - axes of the ellipsoid approximating the cloud , measured in proper physical units ( see  2.2 for definition of @xmath107 ) . for a true ellipsoid cloud , the volume is @xmath108 .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of cloud sizes at @xmath41 for @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the thin curves are weighted by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and the thick curves are weighted by mass .",
    "@xmath109 is an approximation of the average covering area of a cloud on the sky , which is proportional to the probability of the cloud intersecting a line of sight .",
    "the @xmath109-weighted and mass - weighted distributions are very similar , implying that @xmath109 and mass are correlated .",
    "clouds are larger at lower @xmath51 , as expected , and they exhibit a wide range in size , from a few to about a hundred proper kiloparsecs .",
    "the median size varies from @xmath111  kpc at @xmath112 to @xmath113  kpc for @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 is only the cube root of the effective volume of a cloud , so the distribution of cloud sizes would be more varied , if we used @xmath105 ( semi - major axis of an ellipsoid ) instead of @xmath115 as a measure of size .",
    "figure 4 shows the redshift evolution of the median size of the @xmath0 clouds .",
    "note that here the size ( vertical axis ) is in comoving length units , which might be easier to interpret .",
    "our data indicates that @xmath0 clouds grow with time in comoving length units at a moderate rate , and that this rate depends _ weakly _ on the density ( i.e. , three curves for the three density cases are almost parallel to each other ) . the fact that denser regions are not shrinking , but rather expanding at a rate similar to that of less dense regions implies that the merger / accreation rate is _ higher _ in the dense regions than in less dense regions . without merger / accretion effects",
    ", the high density regions would appear to shrink due to gravitational collapse .    to summarize , we find that @xmath0 clouds exhibit a wide range of sizes from a few proper kiloparsecs to about a hundred proper kiloparsecs at z=3",
    ". the comoving size of these clouds tends to increase slowly with time , implying that the proper physical size increases with time more rapidly than @xmath116 .",
    "figures ( 5a , b , c ) show the distributions of cloud shapes in the @xmath117  -  @xmath118 plane for clouds at @xmath66 at @xmath41 .",
    "each dot represents one cloud and the contours indicate the density of clouds ( weighted by @xmath109 ) in the plane .",
    "the contour levels are incremented up linearly from outside to inside .",
    "we see that the most common cloud at @xmath70 and @xmath119 is an ellipsoid with axial ratios of @xmath120 .",
    "however , at @xmath121 the situation is interestingly different .",
    "two major concentrations of clouds are seen at @xmath122 and @xmath123 , indicating the existence of two distinct populations : filaments and near - spherical ellipsoids .    in order to conveniently show the evolution of shapes of the clouds and to relate shapes to other quantities ,",
    "we define a simple  shape \" parameter of a cloud as    @xmath124    for an ideal ( spherical , filamentary , disk ) cloud , @xmath125 . some degeneracy exists for any value of @xmath126 with such a simple definition .",
    "for example , @xmath127 and @xmath128 both give @xmath129 .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath126 as a function of size @xmath115 at @xmath41 for @xmath66 . there is a trend , albeit with a large scatter , that larger clouds tend to be less spherical .",
    "figure 7 represents the @xmath109-weighted cumulative distribution of @xmath126 for three cases at @xmath41 .",
    "we note two points .",
    "first , we see that there is negligibly small fraction of clouds with the shape parameter @xmath126 greater 1.5 , indicating that spherical clouds ( @xmath130 ) contribute only a tiny percentage to the total covering area of the clouds at all three density cuts .",
    "second , we find a larger fraction of round clouds ( large @xmath126 ) _ and _ filamentary clouds ( @xmath126 close to zero ) at high densities than at a lower densities .",
    "this is due to the fact that the large sheets and filaments present at lower densities are broken up into both filaments and turn into roundish regions at higher densities , respectively .",
    "this quantitative result is consistent with the visual impression that structures go from sheets to filaments and spheres as the density goes from low to high ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the fact that there are more filaments than spheres at all densities is probably a consequence of nonlinear evolution coupled with hydrodynamic ( pressure ) effects .",
    "the situation for dark halos might be different , since dark matter distributions tend to be more unstable in lower dimensional structures .    finally , we show in figure 8 the redshift evolution of the median shape paramter @xmath131 .",
    "it indicates that at @xmath70 the median shape of the clouds do not change with time , while at @xmath68 the clouds progress toward the shape of spheres ( larger @xmath126 ) in time with a dramatic upturn from @xmath41 to @xmath102 , possibly related to the collapse / merging of gas along the longest axis .",
    "the situation at the intermediate @xmath67 is between the above two cases .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that @xmath0 clouds display a variety of shapes ranging from semi - spherical clouds to filaments and sheets , with the most common shape being a  flattened cigar \" with an axial ratio of @xmath120 at column density of @xmath132 @xmath6 , and being either a thin cigar with an axial ratios of @xmath133 or near sphere with an axial ratios of @xmath134 at column density of @xmath135@xmath6 .",
    "larger clouds tend to be less spherical .",
    "the shapes of clouds with densities a few times the mean density of the universe evolve very weakly with time , whereas the clouds at higher densities ( @xmath136 ) grow more spherical with time .",
    "none of our analyses so far have been directly comparable with observables .",
    "here we attempt to project our theoretical models onto the observational plane .",
    "cmor and mcor have examined many of the properties of these clouds in detail , and found that the simulation results match observations fairly well . here ,",
    "we focus on the observations of double quasar sightlines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "let us first describe our procedure for modeling these observations .",
    "once three dimensional clouds in the simulation box are identified ( see  2.2 ) , each cell is labelled with an integer @xmath20 , meaning that it belongs to cloud @xmath20 ( if @xmath20 is zero , it means that the cell does not belong to any cloud , i.e. , its density is below @xmath51 ) .",
    "a random pair of sightlines separated by @xmath137 is selected .",
    "since the simulation box has no preferred orientation , we simply choose a direction perpendicular to one of three faces of the simulation box as the direction for the double sightlines .",
    "\\3 . along each of the two sightlines we identify cells whose labels @xmath20 ( see step 1 ) are non - zero , and then separate regions of different @xmath20 into separate clouds , which we call clouds - along - line - of - sight ( calos s ) .",
    "note that each calos inherits its 3-d parent cloud label @xmath20 .",
    "we define the location of each calos in @xmath84-space by finding the @xmath138 weighted center of the calos cells located along the sightline .    \\5 . for each calos along sightline # 1 , if a calos within a velocity space separation @xmath139 along the sightline # 2 is found , the following operation is performed : an integer counter @xmath140 is incremented if the two calos s share the same @xmath20 , i.e. , they belong to the same 3-d cloud",
    ". otherwise an integer counter @xmath141 is incremented by @xmath142 .",
    "if both a common and a clustering line are found , we consider it to be a common pairing .",
    "the above exercise is repeated for each calos along sightline # 2 .",
    "we note that the bulk peculiar velocity of each calos is ignored in this calculation , i.e. , the line - of - sight velocity difference between a pair of coincident lines simply reflects the line - of - sight real space distance difference .",
    "this should be a good approximation , because the peculiar velocity gradient is typically smaller than the hubble constant on the scale @xmath139 ( see below ) in which we are interested .",
    "we perform this exercise on 10,000 randomly selected pairs of sightlines for each value of @xmath66 at six different perpendicular separations , @xmath143  cells .",
    "figure 9 shows the fraction of lines which are coincident at @xmath41 , @xmath144 , as a function of @xmath137 , where @xmath145 and @xmath146 is total number of lines .",
    "six curves are shown , corresponding to three values of @xmath66 , each at two values of @xmath147  km / s .",
    "we see that _ the line coincident rate decreases with increasing column density_. at a perpendicular proper separation of @xmath28kpc and @xmath70 ( corresponding to clouds with @xmath148@xmath6 ) about @xmath149 to @xmath150 of the sightlines should have coincident absorption features for @xmath151km / s to @xmath152km / s .",
    "the line coincident rates drop to @xmath153 and @xmath154 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( corresponding to clouds with @xmath155@xmath6 and @xmath156@xmath6 ) , respectively , at @xmath147km / s .",
    "figure 10 shows the redshift evolution of @xmath144 at @xmath157  kpc in proper units , for four cases with @xmath158 of @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "the indicated neutral hydrogen column densities in figure 9 are approximately computed as follows .",
    "combining equation ( 2 ) for @xmath163 at @xmath41 ( with the adopted fiducial values of various quantities ) with the result that the physical sizes of clouds go roughly as @xmath8 ( figure 4 ) gives @xmath164@xmath6 .",
    "we see that , _ at a fixed column density _ , the rate of coincident lines ( at @xmath165  km / s ) _ increases with redshift at a moderate pace _ , and higher column density clouds and/or smaller @xmath139 yield weaker evolution , assuming that @xmath80 is _ constant _ over the redshift range in question .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath80 is merely for the convenience of illustration .",
    "in fact , the self - consistently produced photoionization field during the simulation is constant from @xmath101 to @xmath102 to within a factor of two .",
    "in other words , the results would not have significantly differed if the actual photoionization field had been used .",
    "given the three dimensional nature of the simulations , we can distinguish between two kinds of coincident lines : one of which ( @xmath140 ) occurs when a pair shares the same 3-d parent cloud , the other of which ( @xmath166 ) occurs when the lines intersect two separate 3-d clouds .",
    "the former set of coincident lines is due to the extended size of a single cloud , while the latter set of coincident lines is due to the clustering of several clouds .",
    "figure 11 shows @xmath167 at @xmath41 .",
    "six curves are shown for @xmath66 with @xmath151  km / s and @xmath152  km / s .",
    "we see that at @xmath168kpc about half of the coincident line pairs share the same clouds and the other half pierce separate clouds . at @xmath157kpc only 10 - 20% of the total coincident line pairs",
    "share the same clouds , i.e. , clustering of separate clouds dominates the coincident events at this and larger separations .",
    "the observational signature of clustering dominated coincident lines is that the difference in line of sight velocity between the two absorption lines should be a weak function of the separation perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "figure 12 shows rms velocity difference of coincident line pairs along the line of sight , @xmath169 , as a function of the perpendicular separation , @xmath137 , for @xmath151  km / s and 150km / s at @xmath66 .",
    "the two long - dashed horizontal lines show the rms difference for the two @xmath139 values , if clouds are small ( compared to perpendicular separation ) and randomly distributed ( i.e. , no clustering ) .",
    "we see that @xmath169 depends rather weakly on @xmath137 when @xmath170kpc , and it approaches the asymptotic limit of a random distribution of clouds at @xmath171kpc .",
    "we predict that for quasar double sightlines at large separations ( @xmath172kpc ) , the rms velocity difference between absorption features common to both sightlines , @xmath169 , should depend on the range being searched in @xmath84-space , @xmath139 , as @xmath173    figures ( 13a , b ) show the redshift evolution of @xmath174 for @xmath175@xmath6 and @xmath176@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "four cases are shown in each figure with two separations , @xmath177kpc and @xmath157kpc both in proper units , and with @xmath151km / s and @xmath152km / s .",
    "we see that the fraction of coincident lines with a separation of @xmath178 proper kpc due to common clouds _ decreases with increasing redshift at fixed column density _ , presumably because clouds are smaller and more crowded at high redshift than at low redshift .",
    "we remind the reader that the total line coincident rate _ increases with redshift _ ( see figure 10 ) , indicates that a higher cloud number density ( crowding of clouds ) at high redshift dominates the line coincident events .",
    "this is consistent with results shown in figure 11 .",
    "the combined results of our quasar double sightline analysis suggest a few basic trends which should be kept in mind when analyzing qso spectra .",
    "the most important of these is that line coincident events can be caused by two different phenomena . at small perpendicular separations ( @xmath179kpc proper )",
    "a pair of coincident lines is most likely to pierce a common cloud , as is usually assumed when analyzing such observations to infer the actual cloud size .",
    "however , at larger @xmath137 , a pair of coincident lines is more likely to penetrate two different clouds which are spatially clustered . at @xmath157 kpc ,",
    "only 10 - 20% of the total coincident line pairs share the same clouds . and at very large separations of @xmath172kpc , the coincident line events can be explained as the random intersection of two unrelated clouds , whose rms difference @xmath169 should relate to the velocity interval @xmath139 as indicated in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "it is tempting to make a connection between @xmath0 clouds and dwarf galaxies and/or moderate redshift faint blue galaxies .",
    "we approach this problem by examining clustering properties of the @xmath0 clouds .",
    "a few cautionary words about the limitations of the simulation are in order here . the simulation box size ( @xmath27mpc comoving ) places severe limits on our ability to study the clustering properties of clouds on large scales with a high degree of accuracy , because it sets an upper limit on the scale of the input power spectrum .",
    "waves longer than the simulation box size would have made a considerable contribution to clustering on larger scales , since the density fluctuations on scales comparable to the simulation box length have started to approach nonlinearity even at redshift @xmath102 ( @xmath180 at @xmath102 on the box scale ) .",
    "the situation becomes even more serious at lower redshift .",
    "nevertheless , we may gain some insight into the distribution of mass on smaller scales , and say somthing useful about the more local clustering properties of clouds .",
    "the three dimensional correlation of the @xmath0 clouds at @xmath41 is shown in figure 14 for @xmath181 .",
    "higher column density clouds seem to be more strongly clustered than lower column density ones .",
    "since most of the faint blue galaxies are thought to be in the redshift @xmath182 , we show in figure 15 the evolution of correlation length @xmath183 ( solid curve ) .",
    "this is defined as the length where the correlation is unity and is plotted for the redshift range @xmath184 , where we have the most confidence in the accuracy of the simulation .",
    "all lengths are shown in comoving units .    in order to estimate the effect of missing power at box - sized scales , we computed the correlation function of the clouds in eight subboxes .",
    "these subboxes were created by dividing the original simulation box into eight equal cubes and pretending that each subbox also has periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dotted line in figure 15 shows the median value of the correlation length for the subboxes , and the vertical bars indicate the full width of the distribution at each redshift ( i.e. , highest and lowest values of @xmath183 ) .",
    "we see that the median correlation length drops about 30 - 40% for a box of size @xmath185mpc .",
    "our best estimate is that the true correlation length at each redshift would be larger than values indicated by the solid curves by perhaps 50% , were the simulation box sufficiently large .",
    "simple extrapolation of the solid curve in figure 15 to lower redshifts is unlikely to give us accurate values of @xmath183 at @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect the value of @xmath183 at these redshifts to be significantly larger than @xmath186mpc comoving , when one takes into account the effect of the missing longer waves .",
    "this correlation length is interestingly close to the observed correlation length of the faint blue galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although an accurate conversion from observed angular correlation function @xmath187 to the 3-d correlation function as computed here requires detailed knowledge of the redshift distribution of the observed faint blue objects , which is currently unavailable .",
    "furthermore , the average mass of these objects is close to @xmath188 ( see table 1 ) , which is in accord with what the mass of the faint blue galaxies is thought to be or required [ , e.g. , babul & rees ( 1992 ) starburst dwarf galaxy model ] .",
    "finally , the number density of the clouds ( with a mean separation of @xmath189mpc at z=2 for @xmath68 ) and its increasing trend with redshift indicate that it is probably quite close to what is thought to be for observed faint blue objects .",
    "these three considerations lend tentative support to the conjecture that the high redshift @xmath0 clouds ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) are the progenitors of the faint blue galaxies .",
    "we have presented a quantitative study of the sizes , shapes , and correlations of @xmath0 clouds in a spatially flat cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant , utilizing state - of - art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including detailed atomic physics for a plasma of primordial composition .",
    "keeping in mind the unavoidable limitations of such numerical experiments due to limited boxsize and limited resolution as well as some approximate treatment of physical processes , a few findings are probably fairly reliable .",
    "structures formed at high redshift @xmath190 due to gravitational growth / collapse of cosmic density perturbations at small - to - intermediate scales ( 100kpc to a few mpc comoving ) are responsible for the observed @xmath0 forest .",
    "these @xmath0 clouds can not be described by a simple model which characterizes their sizes and shapes .",
    "their sizes vary in a wide range from a few kiloparsecs to about one hundred kiloparsecs in proper units with the median size being @xmath191kpc at @xmath41 , and their shapes vary from nearly - spherical ellipsoids to filaments and pancakes .",
    "a typical @xmath0 cloud resembles a  flattened cigar , \" with an axial ratio of @xmath120 at column density of @xmath132 @xmath6 , and is either a thin cigar with an axial ratios of @xmath133 or near sphere with an axial ratios of @xmath134 at column density of @xmath135@xmath6 .",
    "larger clouds are , on average , less spherical than smaller ones .",
    "the physical size of a typical cloud grows with time roughly as @xmath8 while its shape hardly evolves ( except for the most dense regions @xmath9 where tend to be more spherical with time ) .",
    "analysis of simulated quasar double sightlines indicates that coincident absorption features observed in the two spectra can have two different causes . at small perpendicular sightline separations ( @xmath179kpc proper ) , a pair of coincident lines most likely represents absorption from a common cloud",
    "this is usually assumed when analyzing such observations to infer the actual cloud size .",
    "however , at larger @xmath137 , a pair of coincident lines most likely samples two separate clouds which belong to the same cloud cluster . in other words ,",
    "clustering of separate clouds dominates the coincident events at larger double sightline separations . at @xmath157kpc ,",
    "80 - 90% of coincident line pairs can be explained in this fashion . at very large separations , @xmath172kpc ,",
    "the coincident line events are entirely due to random intersections of two unrelated , uncorrelated clouds , whose rms velocity difference @xmath169 should relate to the velocity interval being examined , @xmath139 , as @xmath192 .",
    "analyzing observed coincident absorption lines to infer the actual sizes of @xmath0 clouds by assuming a population of clouds with simplified geometry ( e.g. spheres , disks ) is reasonably accurate only when the double sightline separations are small ( @xmath10kpc ) . for larger",
    "@xmath137 , this exercise is not very meaningful .",
    "the inferred sizes are not related to true sizes of the clouds and are grossly inflated .",
    "we attempt to make a connection between the high column density @xmath0 clouds ( @xmath5 ) and the faint blue galaxies .",
    "the supportive evidence for such a conjecture is threefold .",
    "first , when extrapolated to @xmath182 , the correlation of the high column density @xmath0 clouds ( @xmath193mpc comoving ) is close to that of the observed faint blue galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the typical mass of these objects ( @xmath188 ) is close to that of a dwarf galaxy [ , e.g. , babul & rees ( 1992 ) scenario ] .",
    "finally , the number density of the clouds is reasonably close to what is observed for faint blue objects .",
    "finally , we caution that it may be necessary to extend the simulation s dynamic range to @xmath194 cells in each dimension , in order to have both a larger box ( @xmath195mpc comoving ) and a finer resolution ( @xmath196kpc comoving ) to ensure both a  fair \" sample and fully resolved structures of the objects in question , while maintaining a sufficient mass resolution .",

    "<S> finally , we conjecture that high column density @xmath0 clouds ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) may be the progenitors of the lower redshift faint blue galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this seems plausible because their correlation length , number density ( extrapolated to lower redshift ) and their masses are in fair agreement with those observed .    </S>",
