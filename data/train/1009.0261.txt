    "the evolution of collisionless dark matter is computed with an n - body solver that uses a particle - mesh ( pm ) gravity solver @xcite .",
    "the amr functionality of ` enzo ` provides the capability to dynamically add resolution to regions of the computational domain where it may be required for a variety of reasons , such as baryonic or dark - matter overdensity , resolving the jeans length or shocks .",
    "this makes it possible to have high resolution in regions of interest while ignoring less important areas , thus limiting computational costs .",
    "however , since the whim is thought to reside in regions of relatively low overdensity ( @xmath41 ) , a very large fraction of the computational domain must be properly resolved . rather than allowing for vast regions of adaptive refinement throughout the domain ,",
    "which can introduce significant computational cost simply to manage to the hierarchy of grid patches , we instead choose to run with amr disabled and to perform simulations with large , static grids , referred to here as `` unigrid '' simulations .",
    "star formation is a process that occurs on physical scales many orders of magnitude below the resolution limit of cosmological simulations , yet the products ( radiation , thermal energy , and heavy elements ) have significant influence on the evolution of structure on large scales .",
    "numerical simulations must employ models based on our limited understanding of the physical conditions that produce stars and the impact they have on their surroundings , on the physical scales relevant to the simulations .",
    "numerous prescriptions for feedback have been introduced with slightly varying parameterizations , ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that are capable of broadly reproducing the observed star formation history @xcite .",
    "we use a modified version of the prescription of @xcite in our simulations , which we describe briefly here .",
    "any grid cell is capable of forming stars if the following criteria are met : baryon overdensity , defined here and only here as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the critical density at @xmath1 ; the velocity divergence is negative ; and the cooling time is less than the dynamical time . in all other places , we define baryon overdensity as @xmath44 .",
    "the original prescription of @xcite calls for the additional check of jeans instability . however , we find that in large - scale , fixed - grid simulations , this final criterion is always met , following satisfaction of the first three requirements",
    ". therefore , we ignore the check for jeans instability as a cost - saving measure .",
    "if all three listed criteria are satisfied , then a  star particle , \" representing a large collection of stars , is formed within the grid cell with a total mass , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an efficiency parameter , @xmath47 is the baryon mass in the cell , @xmath48 is the dynamical time of the combined baryon and dark matter fluid , and @xmath49 is the hydrodynamical timestep .",
    "subsequently , this much gas mass is also removed from the grid cell as the star particle is formed , ensuring mass conservation .",
    "while the star particle is formed instantaneously within the simulation , feedback is assumed to occur over a longer time scale , which more accurately reflects the gradual process of star formation . in a single timestep of the simulation , the amount of mass from a star particle converted into newly formed stars is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the current time and @xmath52 the formation time of the star particle .",
    "stellar feedback is represented by the injection of thermal energy and the return of gas and metals to the grid , all in amounts proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "the thermal energy , @xmath54 , and metal mass , @xmath55 , returned to the grid are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the speed of light , @xmath58 is the ratio of thermal energy output to total rest - mass energy of the star particle , and @xmath59 is the fraction of stellar mass returned to the grid as metals . as per equation [ eq : m_star_form ] , the rate of star formation , and hence the rate at which thermal energy and metals are injected into the grid by the star particle , rises linearly , peaking after one dynamical time , then decays exponentially after that .",
    "for a given star particle , 30% , 60% , and 90% of the total feedback production has occurred by 1 , 2 , and 4 dynamical times , respectively . for a threshold baryon overdensity ( as defined above ) of 100 , corresponding roughly to a total overdensity of 600 ( assuming the cosmic ratio of baryonic to dark matter ) , @xmath60 gyr .",
    "we choose parameters for the prescriptions of star formation and feedback similar to those adopted by @xcite .",
    "we assume a star - formation efficiency , @xmath61 , a 25% fraction of stellar mass returned to the grid as gas , and @xmath62 . of the gas returned to the grid ,",
    "10% is returned in the form of metals , for a total metal yield , @xmath63 , consistent with the calculations of @xcite .",
    "this metal yield , @xmath64 , is consistent with average values in the milky way , with a mean star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath65  yr@xmath66 , a core - collapse supernova rate of 1 sn every 40 years ( from pulsar counts ) , and an imf - averaged metal yield of @xmath65 per supernova . for a salpeter imf , the ratio of supernova energy to metal ejecta rest - mass energy is @xmath67 @xcite . with our choice of @xmath59 and @xmath58",
    ", this implies that approximately 27% of the total supernova energy is converted into feedback energy .",
    "as one of the main goals of this work is to understand the relation between metals and the whim , we have also run three additional simulations with the metal yield decreased by a factor of 5 to @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependence of the global star formation history on the various star formation and feedback parameters , finding it difficult to induce a significant deviation .",
    "a parameter study performed as a part of this project showed the star formation history to be robust to changes in the prescription parameters .",
    "this effect is primarily due to the fact that star formation is limited by the amount of cold , collapsing gas , which is independent of the choice of parameter values .    in this paper , we investigate two different methods for injecting feedback into the grid : ( 1 ) depositing all of the feedback into the grid cell where the star particle exists ; and ( 2 ) distributing an equal amount among the central cell and its 26 nearest neighbors .",
    "since this entire procedure is designed to account for processes unresolvable by the simulation , neither method should be considered to be representative of the actual physical processes that are occurring , but are , rather , an attempt to mimic the end state of those processes at the multi - kpc scale . injecting feedback into a single cell has well - known practical limitations : in particular , the great increase in temperature produced by the injection of kinetic or thermal energy in a grid cell with reasonably high density can lead to cooling times that are much shorter than the hydrodynamical timestep , and thus , over - cooling .",
    "this diminishes the ability of the stellar products to propagate away from the source .",
    "this issue can be mitigated by making the assumption that feedback is able to spread to neighboring grid cells before energy is lost through radiative cooling .",
    "this technique was employed by @xcite to mimic the effect of galactic superwinds . in this work , we distribute feedback to the neighboring cells in the form of thermal energy , gas , and metals , and we do not find it necessary to add kinetic energy .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the method of injecting stellar feedback into the central cell and its 26 neighbors as the _ distributed _ method , and the method of inserting feedback solely into the central cell as the _ local _ method .      of utmost importance to properly modeling",
    "the evolution of the whim is an accurate determination of the thermal state of the baryons within the simulation .",
    "@xcite showed that including both the radiative cooling from metals and the photoelectric heating from the uv metagalactic background @xcite is vital for simulations of large - scale structure .",
    "unfortunately , a direct calculation of the heating and cooling rates , including metals , requires solving a network of rate equations that is far too large to be viable for millions , and now billions , of grid cells .",
    "we use an efficient computational method , originated by @xcite and similar to @xcite , of coupling a multidimensional table of heating and cooling values , precomputed with the photoionization software , ` cloudy ` @xcite , to a non - equilibrium , primordial chemistry network @xcite .",
    "the primordial chemistry network solves for the evolution of six species ( h , h@xmath69 , he , he@xmath69 , he@xmath70 , and e@xmath71 ) , including collisional ionization and photo - excitation / ionization rates , using a backward differencing formula .",
    "we use ` cloudy ` version 07.02.01 to construct a grid of heating and cooling rates that vary with density , metallicity , electron fraction , redshift , and temperature .",
    "the redshift determines the nature of the uv metagalactic background , given by @xcite .",
    "we construct an analogous grid of values run with h and he and subtract this from the larger grid , so that only the metal heating and cooling rates remain .",
    "the rates are normalized by the h number density times the electron number density ( @xmath72 ) . during the simulation",
    ", we use the electron density from the primordial network plus a small , metallicity - dependent correction to calculate the heating and cooling contributions of the metals .",
    "we turn on the ionizing ( uv ) background at @xmath73 .",
    "the primordial chemistry network follows the photoionization of h and he , and we interpolate from the grid of data made with ` cloudy ` to include both the heating and cooling due to the metals . for @xmath74 , we use a similar grid of heating and cooling data , created with no radiation background , assuming collisional ionization only .",
    "the metal heating and cooling terms are included within a coupled chemistry and cooling solver . in order to maintain accuracy",
    ", the solver subcycles the cooling and chemistry routines together on timesteps that are no larger than 10% of formation / destruction timescales ( @xmath75 ) of e@xmath71 and h , 10% of the cooling time ( @xmath76 , where @xmath54 and @xmath77 are the internal energy and its time derivative ) , and half of the hydrodynamic timestep .",
    "coupling of the chemistry and cooling solver is particularly crucial in regions of high density and metallicity , where the cooling time is very short and the gas can transition from ionized to neutral within a single hydrodynamic timestep .",
    "we first attempt to quantify the effect of the radiative cooling method chosen by comparing it with a set of four simulations run with less complete treatments .",
    "each of these test simulations has a 25 mpc/@xmath32 box with 512@xmath78 grid cells and dark matter particles , with stellar feedback injected into only one cell .",
    "these simulations are compared to run 25_512_1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sf_cooling_test ] , we plot the comoving star formation rate density for run 25_512_1 and all of the test simulations , along with the compilation of observational data on comoving sfr density by @xcite .",
    "the results of this experiment can be summarized very simply : a higher cooling rate results in a higher sfr .",
    "the removal of radiative cooling from metals results in a significant decrease in the sfr from @xmath79 to the present . in the absence of both metal cooling and the radiation background ( purple line in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] ) ,",
    "the peak in the star formation rate is lower by a factor of a few than the control run , and occurs slightly earlier ( just before @xmath80 , as opposed to just after . )",
    "the low - redshift slope is also much steeper , resulting in a sfr at @xmath1 that is lower by an order of magnitude . @xcite",
    "observe a similar reduction in the peak sfr , but they do not see the steepening of the slope at low redshift reported here .",
    "the uv background provides additional heating to the gas , making it more difficult to form stars . with only primordial cooling ,",
    "the addition of the ionizing background has a far greater influence on the ability of the gas to form stars than when metals are included . in the simulation with the radiation background but no metal cooling ( green line in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] ) , the sfr is more than half an order of magnitude lower than the simulation with no radiation background and no metal cooling , or over one and a half orders of magnitude below the control run , which has both a radiation background and metal cooling .",
    "when metal cooling is included , the presence of the radiation background makes much less of a difference , as can be seen with the blue and black lines in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] .",
    "photoionization is more effective at reducing the cooling efficiency of primordial gas because of the relative ease with which h and he ( compared with heavier elements ) are fully ionized , thus eliminating the ability to cool via line emission .",
    "because primordial coolants alone are reduced more efficiently by the presence of the radiation background , it is much more difficult for the gas in these simulations to continue to cool and form stars . finally , if the metal cooling method does not account for the influence of the radiation background , as was neglected in @xcite , the potential exists for a significant overestimate in the total cooling",
    "this may have been the primary reason that the above work reported the existence of much colder  absorbers than had previously been claimed or is seen in this work .",
    "the red line in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] represents a simulation in which the metal cooling rates do not reflect the presence of the radiation background .",
    "interestingly , we do not see such a dramatic influence on the sfr , as is evidenced by the nearly identical red and black lines in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] .",
    "not all simulations treat the radiative cooling rate consistently with the ionizing background and metal transport .",
    "because the peak of the radiative cooling rate , at temperatures @xmath81 , arises primarily from electron - impact excitation of bound states of abundant metal ions ( , , , ) , a strong uv radiation field will photoionize away those coolants and decrease the cooling .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : sf_cooling_test ] , our most complete cooling model over - predicts the sfr at @xmath82 in this series of simulations , owing to the inability of the feedback prescription to drive the metals away from their source @xcite . as discussed below , we are able to bring the predicted sfr into better agreement with observations simply by distributing the thermal energy and metals over multiple grid cells .",
    "@xcite note the difficulty of matching the observed sfr at both low and high redshift within a single simulation . at high redshift",
    ", extreme resolution is required to resolve the low - mass halos that dominate the global sfr . at low redshift",
    ", a large box size is needed to capture the most massive objects forming from large - scale perturbations in the primordial density field that are only recently becoming nonlinear . in figure",
    "[ fig : sf_comparison ] , we plot the sfr versus redshift and the corresponding stellar density evolution for all simulations listed in table [ tab : sims ] with metal yield , @xmath63 .",
    "we do not see convergence in the sfr at high redshift , as noted in previous studies @xcite .",
    "increasing the spatial and gas / dark matter mass resolution , which do not vary independently in our simulations , allows more low - mass halos to be resolved at progressively higher redshifts , continually increasing the sfr .",
    "convergence at @xmath1 is achieved in our lowest - resolution simulation when using the local feedback method .",
    "when using the distributed method , convergence at @xmath1 is achieved in our second - lowest - resolution simulation .",
    "as the resolution is increased , the redshift at which the sfr is converged also increases , as was noted in @xcite . with the local feedback method ,",
    "the sfr of the two highest resolution runs ( 25_512_1 vs. 25_768_1 and 50_768_1 vs. 50_1024_1 ) agree to within 10% for @xmath83 . for the distributed - feedback simulations ,",
    "this occurs slightly later , at @xmath84 .",
    "since the interval from @xmath85 represents a majority of the age of the universe , the resulting stellar densities at @xmath1 are reasonably converged for all but the most poorly resolved simulations .",
    "all simulations that employ the local feedback method overpredict the sfr at low redshift .",
    "this is due to the over - cooling that occurs when feedback is injected only into the central cell , unphysically driving up the gas temperature and the cooling rate @xcite .",
    "the local feedback simulations with equal resolution have nearly identical sfrs at high redshift .",
    "however , those with the larger box size show slightly lower peak rates and a steeper decline at low redshift .",
    "this is likely due to the ability of the large - box simulations to form structures with higher virial temperatures , in which much of the gas becomes too hot to form stars .",
    "the simulations that use the distributed method display the best agreement with observations . in comparison to their local feedback counterparts ,",
    "the distributed - feedback simulations have peak sfrs lower by 3540% .",
    "the slope of the sfr with redshift ( at @xmath82 ) is also noticeably steeper in the distributed feedback runs .",
    "however , unlike the local feedback simulations , there are no discernable differences between the small - box and large - box simulations of equal resolution when using the distributed method . comparing the highest resolution simulations of each feedback method",
    ", we find the use of local method results in the formation of approximately 1.7 times more stars than the distributed method . in comparison with observational measurements by @xcite of the stellar mass density",
    ", our simulations still appear to produce too many stars by a factor of a few .",
    "however , @xcite point out that independent observations of the sfr and the stellar mass density are not consistent with each other ; the observed sfr implies a stellar density 2 - 3 times higher than what is seen .",
    "the final conclusion is that spreading stellar feedback over 27 cells , rather than just 1 , is largely able to overcome the classic over - cooling problem , yielding a much better fit to fit to observations .      in figure",

    "there are no notable differences for varying baryonic physics . in comparison with the analytical fit of @xcite",
    ", we find our simulations to provide a good match for halos with approximately 400 particles or more , regardless of particle mass .",
    "this result is in good agreement with numerous , prior ` enzo ` simulations , e.g. , @xcite .        in figures [ fig : mass_fraction_convergence_25 ] and [ fig :",
    "mass_fraction_convergence_50 ] , we plot the evolution of the baryon fraction in various igm phases as a function of redshift for the majority of our simulations .",
    "we group the plots in rows and columns , showing box size and feedback parameter so as to focus on convergence .",
    "we divide the baryons into four phases : _ warm _",

    "( @xmath89  k , @xmath87 1000 ) ; and _ condensed _ ( @xmath90 1000 ) .",
    "we also include the total mass in stars in the condensed phase . in practice , the gas in the condensed phase is almost entirely warm . if we define gas with @xmath87 1000 as _ diffuse _ , we see that the ratio of diffuse to condensed whim gas is generally around 20:1 at @xmath1 .",
    "the masses of diffuse and condensed hot gas are within a factor of a few of each other , but neither contributes significantly to the total baryon budget within our simulations , mainly due to the somewhat small box sizes .",
    "note that these phase cuts are slightly different from those of other work , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the results are insensitive to these minor differences in definition . we have also measured the evolution of the baryon fractions , with the overdensity threshold dividing the condensed phase from the other three phases set to 200 , and find the variations to be marginal .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_fraction_convergence_25 ] , we focus on the simulations with the 25 mpc/@xmath32 box size . the top row of figure [ fig : mass_fraction_convergence_25 ] , which shows the evolution of the adiabatic simulations , reaffirms the idea that shock heating from structure formation plays the primary role in the evolution of the whim @xcite . without radiative cooling , star formation , and the uv background ,",
    "the general trends are similar .",
    "warm , photoionized gas makes up roughly 90% of the total baryon mass at @xmath91 , decreasing to @xmath9240% by @xmath1 .",
    "this is offset primarily by an increase in whim gas from @xmath9210% to 40 - 50% over the same interval . in the adiabatic simulations , the mass fractions of warm and hot gas evolve identically , independent of resolution .",
    "since the box size in these simulations is rather small , massive halos with virial temperatures @xmath93 k are practically non - existent .",
    "thus , the fraction of hot gas remains neglible at all times .",
    "the spike in the hot gas fraction at low redshift seen in all of the simulations shown in figure [ fig : mass_fraction_convergence_25 ] occurs due to a merger .",
    "one resolution effect that exists in the adiabatic simulations is a tradeoff between decreasing whim gas and increasing condensed gas with increasing resolution .",
    "as the resolution increases , the increased gravitational force resolution allows more low - mass halos to collapse and cross the critical overdensity threshold to be considered condensed gas ( @xmath94 ) before becoming pressure supported .",
    "in addition , higher resolution allows for smaller - scale perturbations to be resolved in the initial density field , which will also increase the mass in collapsed objects .",
    "the addition of the full complement of physical processes to the simulations significantly alters the convergence properties . for both feedback methods , an increase in resolution yields a slightly lower fraction of warm gas at @xmath1 .",

    "since the star formation rate is the aspect of these simulations that is furthest from convergence , this may suggest that creation of whim gas via gravitational shock heating dominates over stellar feedback for larger box sizes .",

    "the `` bh '' model of @xcite also shows a decreasing whim fraction at low redshift .",
    "however , that simulation , which was also the only one in that work to feature this result , was designed specifically to have feedback from super massive black holes , which we do not include .",

    ", we also see a net flux _ from _ the warm - whim _ to _ the hot - whim . at low redshift ( @xmath102 ) , where the evolution of the warm fraction appears to flatten out , the flux reverses with warm - whim gas now moving back into the warm phase .",
    "likewise , hot - whim gas now begins flowing back into the warm - whim phase . in simulations without radiative cooling ,",
    "the only means of cooling is adiabatic expansion .",
    "this seems to suggest that , irrespective of cooling and feedback , the universe undergoes an epoch of heating fueled by shocks from structure formation followed by an epoch of cooling due simply to the acceleration of the hubble flow . for the cosmological parameters used in this work , the expansion factor ( @xmath103^{1/2}$ ] )",
    "is dominated by @xmath31 for @xmath104 , which is consistent with the epoch at which the whim fraction begins to decrease in our simulations .",
    "when analyzing run 50_1024_2 in the same manner , we find a similar picture . in figure",

    "the overall contribution of radiative cooling and feedback to the evolution of the baryon phases is less clear , as they add both heating and cooling . with cooling and feedback",

    "[ fig : mass_fraction_50_768 ] , we focus on the influence of feedback on the evolution of the baryon phases . for both box sizes ,",
    "the simulation with distributed feedback has roughly 10% more whim than the simulation with local feedback .",
    "the additional whim in the distributed feedback simulations comes at the expense of condensed gas .",
    "this is another example of the ability of the distributed method to overcome the over - cooling problem associated with local feedback .",
    "interestingly , the runs with lower metal yield , denoted with the letter _  b \" _ in their labels , reach their peak whim fraction at systematically higher redshifts than their higher metal - yield counterparts .",

    "higher redshift , the low - yield runs have slightly more whim gas .",
    "however , the whim begins to decrease at earlier times , and the resulting whim fraction at @xmath1 is lower .",
    "the low - yield runs also have lower condensed fractions , except in the case of run 50_768_2b . in every case , these offsets are balanced by a higher fraction of warm gas . in comparison to their high - yield analogs ,",
    "the low - yield runs reach their peak sfr slightly earlier ( @xmath108 as opposed to @xmath109 ) and have significantly lower sfr at low redshift ( roughly 0.5 dex compared to their higher - yield counterparts ) .",
    "both of these can be attributed to the lower radiative cooling efficiency resulting from the decreased metal yield .",
    "these clues highlight the importance of accurate treatments of cooling and feedback in the evolution of the whim .",
    "the use of distributed feedback increases the whim fraction by transporting stellar feedback into the igm with greater efficiency . lowering the metal yield produces a similar effect , but it also suppresses the sfr more effectively .",
    "interestingly , the single simulation of @xcite to show a decline in whim fraction at low redshift also happens to be the run in which the star formation rate is reduced by the greatest amount during that epoch .",
    "while radiative cooling may be responsible for some additional amount of gas that is just above @xmath12 k , cooling into the warm phase , the majority of baryons residing in the whim are at low enough density that their cooling time exceeds the hubble time .",
    "thus , it seems that the role of radiative cooling is to enhance the ability of dense gas to cool and continue to form stars , which then inject thermal energy into the igm , heating the gas into the whim phase .",
    "ultraviolet absorption lines of  ( 1032 , 1038  ) are believed to be excellent probes of the cooler portion of the whim , as the peak fraction of collisionally ionized  occurs at @xmath110 k. however , @xcite have claimed that the majority of  absorption comes from warm , photoionized gas ( @xmath111 15,000 k ) , although their results are likely to be affected by the significant over - cooling within their simulations .",
    "they suggest that  may not be a reliable whim tracer .",
    "nonetheless , there exists a number of large surveys of  absorption lines at low redshift @xcite that provide excellent tests of numerical simulations . in this section ,",
    "we make such comparisons .",
    "our simulations provide a useful database that can be compared to observations of  and other ions along sight lines to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "since the @xmath113 corresponding to the length of our simulation boxes is much smaller than the desired redshift depth , our sight - line generation technique involves stacking multiple rays cast through simulation boxes from different epochs . before running the simulations , we compute the exact number of data outputs and their location in redshift space required to traverse the comoving distance from @xmath112 to @xmath1 , using ray segments no longer than the box length .",
    "for example , at @xmath112 , a comoving distance of 50 mpc/@xmath32 corresponds to @xmath114 .",
    "thus , in this case , the next data output in the series is chosen to be at @xmath115 .",
    "we continue this process until reaching @xmath1 . for the 25 ( 50 ) mpc/@xmath32 boxes , 47 ( 23 ) data outputs are required to span the redshift range . in this method ,",
    "each sight line is able to sample the simulation box at continuously earlier epochs as it extends further away .",

    "quantities such as the temperature and metallicity of a smoothed lixel are taken as the mass - weighted averages of all contributing lixels .",

    "when considering the distribution of metals , the two simulations appear even more distinct .",
    "a significant portion of the gas - phase metals in the local feedback run exist in the warm , high - density gas that is not present in the distributed - feedback run .",
    "these metals are newly created by stars , yet unable to escape their points of origin due to over - cooling . while the two runs produce roughly the same number of gas - phase metals , the run with local feedback produces significantly more metals in stars . defining @xmath196 and @xmath197 to be the total amount of metals in stars and gas with respect to closure density of the universe , we find @xmath198 and @xmath199 for the run with local feedback and @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the run with distributed feedback .",
    "in contrast , the distributed - feedback simulation shows far more metals in the whim phase . to be exact , of the metals not in stars , 44% by mass are in the whim phase in the local simulation , whereas 73% are located in the whim in the distributed simulation .",
    "differencing the two panels of figure [ fig : t_od_metals_25 ] reveals that the greatest increase in metal mass , from the local to the distributed simulations , lies on an adiabat extending from @xmath194 k and @xmath202 directly into the heart of the whim .",
    "these are metals outflowing from galaxies into the igm , cooling adiabatically as they expand into underdense gas . in summary , even though the local feedback simulation produces more metals , most of them become locked up in their host galaxies , unable to escape into the igm . in contrast , the distributed - feedback simulation creates overall fewer metals , but it transports them into the whim far more efficiently .      in order to answer this question , we plot the distribution of   mass from the c+p model in bins of temperature and baryon overdensity for run 50_1024_2 at @xmath1 in the left panel of figure [ fig : t_od_ovi_cloudy_50_2 ] . from this",
    ", we can see that the impression given by figure [ fig : absorber_stats_25 ] that the mean temperature of  absorbers is @xmath184  k is misleading .",
    "instead , it appears that  has a bimodal distribution in temperature , with populations existing at @xmath203  k ( mostly photoionized ) and at @xmath204  k ( primarily collisionally ionized ) .",
    "we do not see any significant fraction of  at @xmath205 k , as claimed by @xcite . for the simulation shown , the fractions of total",
    "mass are : 55% in the whim , 37% in the warm phase , and 8% in the condensed phase .",
    "the fraction of  in the hot phase ( @xmath89  k ) is negligible .    given these statistics , the next question is : _ are these phases proportionally represented by the absorbers ? _ in the right panel of figure [ fig : t_od_ovi_cloudy_50_2 ] , we plot each one of the synthetic absorbers created for run 50_1024_2 , using the c+p model , on the plane of baryon overdensity and temperature with which they are associated , coloring each absorber according to column density . with respect to the total column density ,",
    "59% of the synthetically observed is in the whim , with 36% in the warm phase and 5% in the condensed phase . given the somewhat arbitrary definition of the condensed phase , the calculated fraction of  in this phase is not likely to be a very robust quantity .",
    "if we consider only  absorbers with column densities greater than 10@xmath206 , closer to the observable range of  with hst and fuse , the fraction in the whim decreases to 57% , the warm fraction increases to 37% , and the condensed fraction increases to 6% .",
    "this indicates that there is little biasing of the observed  away from the true  distribution .",
    "in contrast , the simulations of @xcite show a similar distribution of  mass ( bottom panel of figure 3 in that work ) , yet do not produce a significant number of  absorbers in the warm phase .",
    "we have performed a series of cosmological simulations designed to study the evolution of the whim and its observability in low - redshift   absorption lines .",
    "the primary goals of this work are to find an optimal parameterization of the processes of star formation and feedback and to understand the extent to which the results of these simulations are converged and can be trusted .",
    "we investigated two methods of depositing stellar feedback onto the simulation grid : ( 1 ) injecting all of the gas , metal , and thermal energy created by a star particle into the single cell in which it is located ( local feedback ) ; ( 2 ) distributing this feedback evenly over the central cell and its 26 nearest neighbors ( distributed feedback ) . at low redshift ( @xmath102 ) ,",
    "the local - feedback simulations show star formation rates ( sfrs ) much higher than observed .",
    "this appears to be the result of over - cooling that occurs when the injection of thermal energy into a single grid cell results in an unphysically high cooling rate .",
    "we find that using the distributed - feedback method significantly lowers the low - redshift sfr and provides a much better fit to observations .",
    "for both feedback models , the sfr appears converged with respect to spatial and mass resolution at low redshift . at high redshift ,",
    "the simulations are far from converged , even though the sfrs of the highest - resolution runs are not in significant disagreement with observations , however unreliable these observations may currently be . nevertheless , the final mass in stars is reasonably well converged , as the bulk of cosmic time occurs at low redshift .",
    "the choice of feedback method has a significant impact on the fraction of baryons in the whim . for our highest - resolution simulations",
    ", there is a 10% difference in whim fraction at @xmath1 , with @xmath207 of baryons in the whim in the local - feedback simulation and @xmath208 in the distributed - feedback simulation .",
    "however , these results are not totally converged .",
    "there is a significant lack of convergence in the whim fraction for the 25 mpc/@xmath32 box simulations with local feedback .",
    "the distributed - feedback simulations appear much closer to convergence on the whim fraction .",
    "however , those runs still show a slight increase in condensed gas and a decrease in distributed gas with increasing resolution .",
    "it is encouraging that the baryon fractions for the distributed - feedback simulations of both box sizes are in good agreement with each other .",
    "in slight contrast to other work on this subject , e.g. , @xcite , we do not see the fraction of whim gas continuing to rise at @xmath1 .",
    "instead , all our simulations show the whim fraction to peak at @xmath105 , then decrease by a few percent by the present day . as noted above in  [ sec : baryon_phase_feedback ] , a small number of simulations in other works have shown a decline in whim fraction at late time .",
    "however , none of those studies see this phenomenon to be as ubiquitous as we do .",
    "we find that the decline in whim is offset by a leveling off of the warm gas fraction that is decreasing until @xmath105 and a continual increase in the condensed fraction . by measuring the flux of baryons from one phase to another",
    ", we see that the universe undergoes an epoch of heating fueled by the formation of structure , followed by an epoch of adiabatic cooling when the hubble flow begins to accelerate due to the influence of @xmath31 .",
    "encouragingly , the redshift at which @xmath31 becomes dominant ( @xmath209 , with the cosmological parameters used here ) is consistent with when we observe the whim fraction starting to decrease .",
    "radiative cooling has two effects .",
    "the total amount of condensed gas is increased by the addition of radiative cooling , coming at the expense of whim gas .",
    "however , radiative cooling , primarily from metals , also enables dense gas to recool after being heated by stellar feedback , allowing it to continue to form stars and inject heat into the igm .",
    "we used our highest - resolution simulations to create populations of synthetic  absorbers .",
    "we compared these with the observed number density per unit redshift ( @xmath23 ) of  absorbers from @xmath1 to @xmath112 as measured by @xcite .",
    "we experimented with two methods for calculating the fraction of oxygen in : the cie model , which assumes collisional ionization equilibrium , and the c+p model , which adds photoionization from the uv background of @xcite .",
    "overall , the distributed - feedback simulations , in conjunction with the c+p model for computing @xmath130 , provide the best match to the observations .",
    "the c+p model provides an exceptional fit for low column density absorbers with @xmath3  @xmath148 , but it slightly over - predicts the number of higher column density absorbers , although still within the error for the distributed - feedback simulations .",
    "the cie model fits the @xmath23 of the higher column density ( @xmath3  @xmath210 @xmath211 ) absorbers better than the c+p model .",
    "previous studies have also noted that low column density absorbers are better matched with photoionization models , while high column density absorbers are better matched with collisional ionization models @xcite .",
    "@xcite used relatively simple arguments to predict the maximum column density of characteristic  absorbers to be slightly over @xmath212 @xmath5 . in nearly all of our models ,",
    "we observe the @xmath145@xmath3@xmath146 of  to drop below unity at roughly similar column densities .",
    "@xcite noted , as do we , that there is some dependence of the number of low column density absorbers on feedback method , with distributed - feedback methods producing more than local - feedback methods .",
    "this difference is much more significant when using the cie model to calculate @xmath130 .",
    "as is shown in figure [ fig : projections_50_2 ] , the cie model produces large amounts of  at great distances from collapsed structures , precisely where distributed - feedback methods excel over local feedback . on the other hand , the c+p model limits  to regions much closer to galaxies where the choice of feedback model is less likely to make such a difference .",
    "given that the c+p model appears to be a much better fit to the observed number density of low column density absorbers , the prospects for constraining the properties of galactic outflows with  may be limited . in ionization equilibrium with the c+p model , collisional",
    "ionization is dominant for @xmath213 ( figure [ fig : ion_balance ] ) .",
    "however , the mean baryon density associated with  absorbers with the high column density  absorbers is between @xmath214 @xmath140 and @xmath215 , or overdensities ranging from @xmath216 232,300 at @xmath1 .",
    "future simulations that incorporate radiation transport will likely be required to fully understand why the influence of photoionization appears to be reduced in these regions .",
    "the average physical conditions sampled by the two  ionization models are quite different , especially for low column densities .",
    "the highest column density absorbers , with @xmath3  @xmath217 , have similar properties in both models and typically result from the rare combination of high physical density , high metallicity , and high @xmath130 .",
    "in general ,  absorbers from the cie model have higher associated baryon densities , lower metallicities , higher temperatures , and higher @xmath130 than those in the c+p model . in a later paper",
    ", we will investigate the implications of the covariance in these parameters for the ( -based ) igm baryon census . while  absorbers from the cie model probe temperatures in a narrow range around the peak in @xmath130 ( @xmath218 k ) , the average  absorber temperature in the c+p model is much closer to @xmath219 k. this is noteworthy , as it differs significantly from the recent simulations of @xcite who find absorbers to have average temperatures of @xmath220 k. although the mean absorber temperature is @xmath221 k in the c+p model , a closer inspection reveals two distinct populations of  at @xmath222 k and @xmath218 k. we find that 55% of all   is in the whim , 37% is in warm gas , and 8% is in condensed gas .",
    "these proportions , which come from summing the total  mass in the simulation box at @xmath1 , are reasonably well represented by the sample of synthetic   absorbers , with only a few percent bias toward the whim .",
    "we acknowledge a number of caveats to our current work .",
    "radiation transport and ionizing sources are not explicitly present in our simulations , nor do we include any ionizing sources or spatially varying radiation background .",
    "the radiation background is treated by altering the h / he photoionization rates in a time varying , yet spatially uniform manner .",
    "the addition of radiation transport and ionizing sources may change the results significantly , given that the  absorbers are observed to be clustered around filaments @xcite and thus statistically nearer to sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "we also do not track the non - equilibrium evolution of @xmath130 , as has been done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while @xcite showed that non - equilibrium calculations of @xmath130 can alter the @xmath23 distribution in  column density , we were still able to fit the observations remarkably well with the c+p model .",
    "in future work , we will include a non - equilibrium calculation of the evolution of ionization fractions for oxygen and other heavy elements .",
    "we have shown that the number of  absorbers depends sensitively on the metal yield from stars , but we have not included feedback processes that release metals in varying abundance patterns .",
    "for instance , @xcite consider the feedback from type ia and type ii supernovae separately .",
    "this also changes the rate of injection of thermal energy .",
    "the parameters we have chosen for our star formation and feedback methods reflect our assumption that stars form with a salpeter imf at all times , which is not necessarily true . @xcite",
    "have pointed out inconsistencies between the observed star formation rate and the observed stellar density ; the observed sfr implies a much higher stellar density than observed .",
    "since we are able to match the observed evolution of sfr , our simulations are also producing too many stars .",
    "@xcite claim that this problem could be solved if the stellar imf was more top - heavy at high redshift ( @xmath223 ) , an idea also supported by @xcite .",
    "other recent works have cited observational discrepancies that may be potentially solved with an evolving imf with characteristic mass increasing with redshift , e.g. , @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the high - redshift cmb can suppress fragmentation in star forming clouds , leading to an imf that evolves with cosmic time and creates additional massive stars in the past .",
    "a varying imf would have a significant effect on the creation and dispersal of metals in the early universe , and may be sufficiently important to consider in studies of the enrichment of the igm .    in subsequent papers , we will address the observability of the whim in  and and other important elements , such as c , n , and ne . we will also investigate other radiation backgrounds and their influence on photoionized absorbers .",
    "the slope of @xmath23  at low column density is sensitive to the shape and intensity of the radiation background , offering a means of constraining this background with simulations . in the very near future",
    ", it will be feasible to include radiation transport in these simulations .",
    "we will combine radiation transport hydrodynamics simulations with non - equilibrium treatment of ionization balance in the metal species to study the effect of local , non - uniform radiation on whim observables .",
