    "the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0mesons has been recently a subject of thorough studies at hera @xcite , and serves to elucidate the physics of the qcd pomeron and/or the small@xmath6 gluon density in the proton ( for a recent review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "being charged particles , protons / antiprotons available at e.g. rhic , tevatron and lhc are a source of high energy weizscker ",
    "williams photons , and photoproduction processes are also accessible in hadronic collisions .",
    "hadronic exclusive production mechanisms of mesons at central rapidities in @xmath7 collisions were intensively studied in the 1990-ies at energies of a few tens of gev @xcite , and raised much theoretical interest for their potential of investigating exotic hadronic states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently there was interest in describing diffractive exclusive production of heavy scalar @xcite and pseudoscalar @xcite mesons in terms of off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions , which may provide insight into the related diffractive production mechanism of the higgs boson ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a purely hadronic mechanism for the exclusive production of @xmath2 mesons in proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions was suggested as a candidate in searches for yet another exotic object of qcd , the elusive odderon exchange @xcite . in order to identify the odderon exchange one",
    "has to consider all other possible processes leading to the same final channel which in the context of the searches for the odderon will constitute the unwanted background .",
    "one of such processes ( and perhaps the only one at the level of fully exclusive @xmath2-production ) is pomeron - photon or photon - pomeron fusion @xcite , which we study in this communication at a more detailed level than available in the literature .",
    "we feel that its role as a background for odderon searches warrants a more detailed analysis including energy dependence and differential distributions of the photoproduction mechanism in hadronic collisions . as will be discussed , the process considered here",
    "is interesting also in its own rights .",
    "an important concern of our work are absorption effects .",
    "more often than not absorption effects are either completely ignored or included as a multiplicative reduction factor , which is simply wrong for many observables ( like distributions in @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) as we shall show in our paper .",
    "we think this point requires broader public spread as it often appears to be forgotten or ignored .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of several differential distributions in order to identify the absorption effects .",
    "we also put a special emphasis on interference phenomena .",
    "we will discuss also more subtle phenomena like the spin flip in the electromagnetic vertices and a charge asymmetry by comparing differential distributions in proton - proton and proton - antiproton exclusive @xmath0 production .",
    "in this work , we do not include a possible odderon contribution .",
    "we wish to stress , that the photoproduction mechanism of exclusive @xmath2 s must exist without doubt , and does not die out as energy increases .",
    "a related purely hadronic ( odderon ) contribution with the same properties has not been unambiguously identified in other experiments , and hence can not be estimated in a model - independent way . while certain qcd - inspired toy - models for cp - odd multigluon t - channel exchanges exist , they do not allow reliable calculations of hadronic amplitudes .",
    "in practice the magnitude of the corresponding born amplitude strongly depend on the details of how to treat gluons in the nonperturbative domain , as well as on the modeling of proton structure .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence of the full ( beyond the born approximation , and beyond perturbation theory ) amplitude is unknown and it can even not be excluded that this contribution would vanish with rising energy .",
    "it is not the issue of our paper to further discuss such models , we rather think that in the search for an odderon one should take further initiative , if substantial deviations from the more conservative physics discussed here are found .",
    "here we present the necessary formalism for the calculation of amplitudes and cross  sections .",
    "the basic mechanisms are shown in fig.[fig : diagram_photon_pomeron ] .     the sketch of the two mechanisms considered in the present paper : @xmath11 ( left ) and @xmath12 ( right ) .",
    "some kinematical variables are shown in addition . ]",
    "the distinctive feature , when compared to photoproduction in lepton ",
    "hadron collisions , is that now both participating hadrons can serve as the source of the photon , and it is necessary to take account of the interference between the two amplitudes . due to",
    "the coulomb singularities in the photon exchange parts of the amplitude , the electromagnetic vertices involve only very small , predominantly transverse momentum transfers .",
    "their effect is fully quantified by the well  known electromagnetic dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon . regarding the photoproduction amplitude",
    ", we try to be as far as possible model independent , and take advantage of the precise knowledge of diffractive vector meson production over a broad energy range available from experiments at hera .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath10 process of fig.[fig : diagram_photon_pomeron ] can be decomposed as @xmath13 the outgoing protons lose only tiny fractions @xmath14 of their longitudinal momenta.in terms of their transverse momenta @xmath15 the relevant four  momentum transfers squared are @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the familiar mandelstam variables for the appropriate subsystems . due to the smallness of the photon virtualities , denoted by @xmath19 , applies only to the photon lines . ]",
    "it is justified to neglect the contribution from longitudinal photons , recall that @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "we have given only that part of the current , which gives rise to the logarithmic @xmath31 longitudinal momentum spectrum of photons , which dominates in the high  energy kinematics considered here .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall , that for a massive fermion , that includes a spin  flip contribution originating from its anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath32 .",
    "notice its suppression at small transverse momenta .",
    "the parametrization of the photoproduction amplitude which we used in practical calculations can be found in the appendix . above",
    "we already used the assumption of @xmath33channel  helicity conservation in the @xmath34 transition , which for heavy vector mesons is indeed well justified by experiment @xcite . in summary",
    "we present the @xmath10 amplitude in the form of a 2dimensional vector as @xmath35 the differential cross section of interest is given in terms of @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the rapidity of the vector meson , and @xmath39 is the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the interference between the two mechanisms @xmath11 and @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath43 and introduces a charge asymmetry as well as an angular correlation between the outgoing protons .",
    "clearly , the interference cancels out after integrating over @xmath39 , and the so integrated distributions will coincide for @xmath7 and @xmath44 collisions .",
    "we still need to correct for a major omission in our description of the production amplitude .",
    "consider for example a rest frame of the proton 2 ( the target ) of the left panel of fig [ fig : diagram_photon_pomeron ] . here",
    ", the virtual photon may be viewed as a parton of proton 1 ( the beam ) , separated from it by a large distance in impact parameter space .",
    "it splits into its @xmath45fock component at a large longitudinal distance before the target , and to obtain the sought for production amplitude we project the elastically scattered @xmath45 system onto the desired @xmath2final state @xcite .",
    "we entirely neglected the possibility @xcite that the photon s spectator partons might participate in the interaction , and destroy the rapidity gap(s ) in the final state .",
    "stated differently , for the diffractive final state of interest , spectator interactions do not cancel , and will affect the cross section . as a qcd ",
    "mechanism consider the interaction of a @xmath46beam system with the target by multiple gluon exchanges ( see fig [ fig : multigluon ] ) .",
    "then , for the @xmath2 final state of interest , the interaction of the @xmath47color singlet state is dominated by small dipole sizes @xmath48 ( the scanning radius of @xcite ) .",
    "it can be exhausted by the minimal two  gluon color ",
    "singlet exchange , and will be quantified by the color ",
    "dipole cross section @xmath49 @xcite , respectively its non  forward generalization @xcite .",
    "let @xmath50 be the tranverse separation of the @xmath2 and the target , and @xmath51 the size of the @xmath45dipole as shown in fig [ fig : multigluon ] .",
    "then , the @xmath10 amplitude of section [ 2_to_3 ] will involve , besides the vertex for the @xmath52 transition , the expectation value @xmath53 of @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an optical density of the target . systematic account for the spectator interactions in qcd",
    "however is a difficult problem , as one can not rely on the abramovsky - gribov - kancheli ( agk ) @xcite cutting rules , when due account for color is taken @xcite . to obtain at least a qualitative account of absorptive corrections",
    "we restrict ourselves to only a subclass of absorptive corrections , the diffractive cut , which contribution is model independent @xcite .",
    "regarding our @xmath46system , with @xmath56 denoting the constituent quarks impact parameters , and @xmath57 the impact parameter of the beam proton , the absorbed amplitude in impact parameter space will contain @xmath58 in effect , we merely multiply the born  level amplitude @xmath59 by the probability amplitude for beam and target to pass through each other without inelastic interaction . in momentum space , we obtain the absorbed amplitude as @xmath60 and with @xmath61 the absorptive correction @xmath62 reads mb , @xmath63 @xcite . ] @xmath64 a number of improvements on this result can be expected to be relevant .",
    "firstly , a more consistent microscopic treatment of spectator interactions along the lines of @xcite would be desirable .",
    "experience from hadronic phenomenology @xcite suggests that at tevatron energies , the purely elastic rescattering taken into account by eq.([absorptive_corr ] ) are insufficient , and inelastic screening corrections will to a crude estimate lead to an enhancement of absorptive corrections by a factor @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the cross sections for single , and double  diffractive processes , respectively .",
    "secondly , also the @xmath68 production amplitude will be affected by unitarity corrections .",
    "for example , with increasing rapidity gap @xmath69 between @xmath2 and the target , one should account for additional @xmath33channel gluons , and for sufficiently dense multiparton systems ,",
    "the two - gluon exchange approximation for the @xmath70 transition used above , ultimately becomes inadequate .",
    "for relevant discussions of unitarity / saturation  effects in diffractive @xmath2production , see @xcite , the scaling properties of vector meson production in the presence of a large saturation scale are found in @xcite . in our present approach , where the production amplitude is taken essentially from experiment , one must content oneself with the fact , that ( some ) saturation effects are effectively contained in our parametrization , and any extrapolation beyond the energy domain covered by data must be taken with great caution .     a sketch of the elastic rescattering amplitudes effectively taken into account by eq.([rescattering_term ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall present results of differential cross sections for @xmath2 production .",
    "we shall concentrate on the tevatron energy @xmath71 , where such a measurement might be possible even at present .",
    "while in this paper we concentrate on the fully exclusive process @xmath72 , @xmath73 , it is important to realize , that from an experimental point of view there are additional contributions related to the exclusive production of @xmath74 mesons and their subsequent radiative decays to @xmath75 .",
    "it may be difficult to measure / resolve the soft decay photons and therefore experimentally this contribution may be seen as exclusive production of @xmath0 .",
    "we note in this context that besides the scalar @xmath76 meson , which exclusive production has been discussed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the axial ",
    "vector and tensor states @xmath77 and @xmath78 have larger branching fractions into the relevant @xmath75 channel . although their exclusive production cross sections can be expected to be suppressed at low transverse momenta @xcite , a more detailed numerical analysis is not existing in the literature and would clearly go beyond the scope of the present paper .       @xmath79 as a function of the @xmath2 rapidity ( @xmath80 ) for w = 1960 gev . for a better understanding of the results we also show ( dashed lines ) the subsystem energies @xmath81 and @xmath82 in gev .",

    "this is interesting by itself and requires further detailed studies . in turn",
    ", this means that our estimate of the cross section far from midrapidity region requires extrapolations above the measured energy domain . in fig.[fig : dsig_dy_energy ] we collect rapidity distributions for different energies relevant for rhic , tevatron and lhc .",
    "we observe an occurence of a small dip in the distribution at midrapidities at lhc energy .",
    "the shape of the rapidity distribution at lhc energies however relies precisely on the above mentioned extrapolation of the parametrization of hera  data to higher energies .",

    "the dependence of absorption on @xmath100 is quantified by the ratio of full and born  level cross sections shown by the dotted lines .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_pv_abs ] we show the suppression factor @xmath135 as a function of the @xmath2 transverse momentum at @xmath131 .",
    "it is important to emphasize once more the strong functional dependence on @xmath136 , which is different for @xmath97 and @xmath7 collisions . again , playing with the strength of absorptions shows a modest effect .",
    "the different behaviour of absorptive corrections in @xmath7 and @xmath97 collisions is an interesting observation .",
    "it derives from the fact that rescattering corrections lift the cancellation of the interference term after azimuthal integration .",
    "finally , let us comment on the expected reduction of rapidity distributions from absorptive corrections .",
    "these are , finally , rather flat functions of @xmath80 . for the ratio @xmath137",
    "we obtain , in @xmath97 collisions @xmath138 and for @xmath7 collisions @xmath139 we note that this results in a small charge asymmetry @xmath140 which derives entirely from absorptive corrections .",
    "in this paper we have calculated differential cross sections for exclusive @xmath0 production via photon - pomeron(@xmath11 ) and pomeron - photon ( @xmath12 ) exchanges at rhic , tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "measurable cross sections were obtained in all cases .",
    "we have obtained an interesting azimuthal - angle correlation pattern due to the interference of the @xmath89 and @xmath12 mechanisms .",
    "the interference effect survives over almost the whole range of @xmath0 rapidities . at the tevatron energy one can potentially study the exclusive production of @xmath0 at the photon - proton center - of - mass energies 70 gev @xmath141 1500 gev , i.e. in the unmeasured region of energies , much larger than at hera . at lhc",
    "this would be correspondingly 200 gev @xmath141 8000 gev . at",
    "very forward rapidities this is an order of magnitude more than possible with presently available machines . due to the photon ",
    "pole , the differential cross section is concentrated in the region of very small @xmath8 or / and @xmath9 .",
    "imposing cuts on @xmath8 and @xmath9 lowers the cross section considerably .",
    "electromagnetic helicity - flip processes play some role only when both @xmath142 and @xmath143 are large , that is in a region where also the hypothetical hadronic , odderon exchange , contribution can be present .",
    "it is a distinctive feature of the production mechanism , that mesons are produced at very small transverse momenta , where the interference of @xmath89 and @xmath42 mechanisms induces a strongly different shape of vector ",
    "meson @xmath144 distributions in @xmath7 vs. @xmath97 collisions .",
    "we also estimated absorption effects on various distributions .",
    "in some selected configurations the absorptive corrections lead to the occurence of diffractive minima . naturally , the exact place of diffractive minima depends on the values of the model parameters , but they are washed out when integrated over the phase space or even its part .",
    "absorptive corrections for differential distributions are lively functions of transverse momenta , and can not be accounted for simply by constant suppression factors .",
    "we have found that absorptive corrections induce a small charge ",
    "asymmetry in rapidity distributions and total production cross sections . in the present paper",
    "we have concentrated on exclusive production of @xmath0 at energies @xmath145 gev .",
    "the formalism used here can be equally well applied to exclusive production of other vector mesons , such as @xmath39 , @xmath146 as well as to the lower energies of e.g. fair , j - parc , rhic . for @xmath0production , especially recent parametriztions",
    "@xcite of the photoproduction cross section from threshold to the highest energies may prove useful .",
    "we leave such detailed analyses for separate studies .",
    "the processes considered here are also interesting in the context of recently proposed searches for identifying the odderon .",
    "we find that the region of midrapidities ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath148 gev@xmath91 seems the best in searches for the odderon exchange .",
    "should data reveal deviations from the conservative predictions given by us , a detailed differential analysis of both , photon and odderon ",
    "echange processes , including their interference , in @xmath149 will be called upon .",
    "we thank mike albrow for useful comments regarding the experimental possibilities of exclusive @xmath2production at the tevatron .",
    "we are indebted to tomasz pietrycki for help in preparing some figures .",
    "this work was partially supported by the grant of the polish ministry of scientific research and information technology number 1 p03b 028 28 .",
    "in ref.@xcite the differential cross section @xmath150 for the reaction @xmath151 was parametrized as @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "the values of parameters found from the fit to the data are : @xmath154 = 326 nb / gev@xmath91 , @xmath155 = 95 gev , @xmath156 = 4.63 gev@xmath157 , @xmath158 = 1.224 , @xmath159 = 0.164 gev@xmath157 , @xmath160 = 2.486 .    assuming the dominance of the helicity - conserving transitions , and neglecting the real part , one can write @xmath161 identical for each combination of particle helicities . in our case of hadroproduction",
    "the amplitude is a function of either @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
