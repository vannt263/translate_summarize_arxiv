    "the problem we consider in this paper is the following : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 $ ] are polynomial functions in @xmath5 variables @xmath6 .",
    "hereafter , we fix the set of constraints @xmath7 and denoted by @xmath1 the basic semi - algebraic set defined by these constraints .",
    "the points @xmath8 which satisfy @xmath9 are called the _",
    "minimizers points _ of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "if the set of minimizers is not empty , we say that the _ minimization problem is feasible_.    the objectives of the method we consider are to detect if the minimization problem is feasible and to compute the minimum value of @xmath0 and the minimizer points where this minimum value is reached , when the problem is feasible .",
    "though this global minimization problem is known to be np - hard ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a practical challenge is to devise methods which can approximate or compute efficiently the solutions of the problem .    about a decade ago",
    ", a relaxation approach has been proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) to solve this difficult problem . instead of searching points where the polynomial @xmath0 reaches its minimum @xmath10 , a probability measure which minimizes the function",
    "@xmath0 is searched .",
    "this problem is relaxed into a hierarchy of finite dimensional convex minimization problems , which can be solved by semi - definite programming ( sdp ) techniques .",
    "the sequence of sdp minima converges to the minimum @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this hierarchy of sdp problems can be formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities on moment matrices associated to the set of monomials of degree @xmath11 or less , for increasing values of @xmath11 .",
    "the dual hierarchy can be described as a sequence of maximization problems over the cone of polynomials that are sums of squares ( sos ) .",
    "a feasibility condition is needed to prove that this dual hierarchy of maximization problems also converges to the minimum @xmath10 , i.e. that there is no duality gap .",
    "this approach provides a very interesting way to approximate a global optimum of a polynomial function on @xmath1 .",
    "but one may wonder if using this approach , it is possible to compute in a finite number of steps , this minimum and the minimizer points when the problem is feasible . from a computational point of view , the following issues need to be addressed :    1 .",
    "is it possible to use an _ exact _ sdp hierarchy , i.e. which converges in a finite number of steps ? 2 .",
    "how can we recover all the points where the optimum is achieved if the optimization problem is feasible ?    to address the first issue ,",
    "the following strategy has been considered : add polynomial inequalities or equalities satisfied by the points where the function @xmath0 is minimum .",
    "a first family of methods are used when the set @xmath1 is compact or when the minimizer set can be bounded easily . by adding an inequality constraint , one can then transform @xmath1 into a compact subset of @xmath12 , for which exact hierarchies can be used @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if the complex variety defined by the equalities @xmath13 is finite ( and thus @xmath1 is compact ) , then the hierarchy of relaxation problems introduced by lasserre in @xcite is exact .",
    "it is also proved that there is no duality gap if the generators of this ideal satisfy some regularity conditions . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that if the real variety defined by the equalities @xmath13 is finite , then the hierarchy of relaxation problems introduced by lasserre is exact , this answers an open question in @xcite .    in a second family of methods , equality constraints which are naturally satisfied by the minimizer points",
    "are added .",
    "these constraints are for instance the gradient of @xmath0 when @xmath14 or the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) constraints , obtained by introducing lagrange multipliers . in @xcite , it is proved that a relaxation hierarchy using the gradient constraints is exact when the gradient ideal is radical . in @xcite , it is shown that this gradient hierarchy is exact , when the global minimizers satisfy the boundary hessian condition . in @xcite , it is proved that a relaxation hierarchy which involves the kkt constraints is exact when the kkt ideal is radical . in @xcite , a relaxation hierarchy obtained by projection of the kkt constraints",
    "is proved to be exact under a regularity condition on the _ real _ minimizer points . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar relaxation hierarchy is shown to be exact under a stronger regularity condition for the _ complex _ points of associated kkt varieties .",
    "these regularity conditions require that the gradient of the active constraints evaluated at the points of @xmath1 or of some complex varieties are linearly independent .",
    "thus they can not be used for general semi algebraic sets @xmath1 , for instance when @xmath1 is a real non - complete intersection variety .",
    "moreover , the assumption that the minimum is reached at a kkt point is required .",
    "unfortunately , in some cases the set of kkt points of @xmath1 can be empty .",
    "as we shall see , this obstacle can be removed using fritz john variety ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is not much work dedicated to this issue ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the case where the infimum value is not reached has also been studied . in @xcite , relaxation techniques are studied for functions for which the minimum is not reached and which satisfy some special properties `` at infinity '' . in @xcite ,",
    "tangency constraints are used in a relaxation hierarchy which converges to the global minimum of a polynomial , when the polynomial is bounded by below over @xmath12 . in @xcite ,",
    "generic changes of coordinates and a partial gradient ideal are used in a relaxation hierarchy which also converges to the global minimum of @xmath0 on @xmath12 .    in the cases studied so far",
    ", the exactness of the relaxation is proved under a genericity condition or a compactness property . from an algorithmic point of view",
    ", the flat extension condition of curto - fialkow @xcite is used in most of the works @xcite to detect the exactness of the hierarchy , when the number of minimizers is finite . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that the curto - fialkow flat extension criterion is eventually satisfied on truncated moment matrices under some regularity conditions or archimedean conditions .",
    "in @xcite , a sparse extension @xcite of this flat extension condition is used to compute zero - dimensional real radical ideals .",
    "the second issue is related to the problem of computing all the minimizer points , which is also important from a practical point of view . in @xcite , the kernel of moment matrices",
    "is used to compute generators of the real radical of an ideal .",
    "this method is improved in @xcite to compute a border basis of the real radical , involving sdp problems of significantly smaller size , when the real radical ideal is zero - dimensional .",
    "the case of positive dimensional real radical ideal is analysed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problem of computing the minimizer ideal for general optimization problems from exact relaxation hierarchies has not been addressed , though it is mentioned in @xcite for zero - dimensional minimizer ideals    notice that problem can be attacked from a purely algebraic point of view .",
    "it reduces to the computation of a ( minimal ) critical value and polynomial system solvers can be used to tackle it ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but in this case , the complex solutions of the underlying algebraic system come into play and additional computation efforts should be spent to remove these extraneous solutions .",
    "semi - algebraic techniques such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition or extensions @xcite may also be considered here , providing algorithms to solve problem , but suffering from similar issues .    * contributions . *",
    "our aim is to show that for the general polynomial optimization problem , exact sdp relaxations can be constructed , which either detect that the problem is infeasible or compute the minimal value and the ideal associated to the minimizer points .",
    "the main contributions are the following :    * we prove that exact relaxation hierarchies depending on the variables @xmath15 can be constructed for solving the optimization problem ( see theorem [ thm : exact ] and theorem [ cthprin ] ) . * we show that even if the minimizer points are not kkt points , we can find them using the fritz john variety ( see section 3.3 and section 3.4 ) .",
    "we describe an approach , which splits this minimizer set into the kkt minimizer set and the singular minimizer set which can be recursively computed using the same method . *",
    "we prove that if the set of kkt minimizers is empty , the sdp relaxation will eventually be empty ( theorem [ thm : exact ] ) .",
    "* we prove that the kkt minimizer ideal can be constructed from the moment matrix of an optimal linear form , when the corresponding relaxation is exact , even if the ideal is not zero - dimensional ( theorem [ cthprin ] ) .",
    "* we prove that the exactness of the relaxation depends only on the real points which satisfy these constraints ( theorem [ cthprin ] ) .",
    "* we provide a general approach which allows us to treat in a uniform way and to extend results on the representation of polynomials which are positive ( resp .",
