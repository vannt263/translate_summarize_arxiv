    "quantitative determination of the shape of capillary surfaces has been one of the standard problems in hydrodynamics , and several different techniques have been developed to deal with this .",
    "one typical example is the stationary pending droplet . from its surface profile",
    "one can deduce the surface tension @xcite . nowadays",
    ", digital imaging is used to determine the edges of the photographed object , and the intensity change at the surface is imaged with a limited amount of pixels on the camera chip . a standard high resolution procedure used to reconstruct the interface",
    "is based on an evaluation of the intensity gradient @xcite by using a gauss filter and a sobel operator @xcite .",
    "the latter is a discrete differentiation operator that calculates the gradient of the image intensity function .",
    "typically , heuristic fitting functions , e.g. a sigmoid , are then used to model the interface , and the resolution can be improved by an educated guess on the model function . in this way",
    ", one goes already beyond the ideal view that the imaged contours correspond to a step function , and these procedures allow significant sub - pixel resolution     fold objective under white light illumination .",
    "left : measured diffracted light intensity pattern from a typical section of the right image .",
    "the straight red lines indicate the intensity level at infinity and at @xmath2 of this level .",
    "the one - fourth level indicates the actual position of the interface .",
    "the inset shows the diffraction pattern for the case of a fully absorbing object of diameter @xmath3 , illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the distance perpendicular to the optical axis and q is related to the edge - detector distance ( see text ) . ]",
    "there are different approaches to improving the optical resolution beyond abbe s diffraction limit @xcite , often by evaluating the intensity profile of the diffracted light in the near field .",
    "a simple fitting function can be used to evaluate the shape of the interface .",
    "this super - resolution technique was being developed several years ago @xcite and applied successfully in near field scanning optical microscopy at a resolution down to 12 nm@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite some of the authors of the present studies have shown that in extensional rheometry experiments one can resolve the amplitude of the sinusoidal deformation of the cylindrical liquid filament down to a resolution of @xmath6 nm . a capillary break - up rheometer ( caber ) consists of two steel plates with a droplet of a viscoelastic sample liquid placed between them .",
    "the steel plates are drawn apart and due to the action of the capillary forces , the capillary bridge starts to shrink , and , at least in polymer solutions , one typically observes a long lasting filament that shrinks exponentially in time and eventually becomes unstable to a rayleigh - plateau like instability .",
    "the flow in the filament is purely elongational and the polymers are very efficiently stretched , therefore , the resistance to the flow is much stronger than in shear flow , which is described by the elongational viscosity . with knowledge of the surface tension one can deduce this elongational viscosity by simply evaluating the thickness of the filament as a function of time . in simple , newtonian fluids ,",
    "the elongational viscosity is simply three times the shear viscosity due to geometrical scaling ; this is trouton s ratio .",
    "the aim of the present manuscript is to describe the optical procedure in more detail .",
    "our experimental method is closely related to what is called laser diffraction edge detection in industrial applications @xcite .",
    "the edge position of an object from its fresnel diffraction pattern can be detected either by illumination with a monochromatic light of wavelength @xmath4 or with a polychromatic light of a given bandwidth @xmath7@xmath4 .",
    "the diffraction pattern in the near field depends on the distance of the object from the source , and the full relation between the object and the electromagnetic field in the full space is quite complex .",
    "however , if one is interested only in the position of the edge , one can devise a simple formula from which information on the position of the object s edge can be deduced , and where only the ( averaged ) distance between the imaged electromagnetic intensity distribution and the object has to be taken as a fitting parameter .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fresnelbeugung ] shows the textbook case of fresnel diffraction with monochromatic light at the edge of a fully absorbing object , as well as the distances of the intensity maxima and minima from the edge scale with 1/@xmath8 , where q is the distance between the object and ( imaged ) measuring position .",
    "it can be shown that the edge of the object is located at @xmath2 of its intensity at infinity @xmath9 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fresnelbeugung ] the measured intensity distribution pattern around one edge is shown in the case of white light interacting with a human hair .",
    "our home - made caber consists of two steel discs with a diameter of @xmath10 .",
    "the lower disc is fixed and the upper disc can be drawn apart with a linear motor ( p01 - 23x80 , linmot , spreitenbach , switzerland ) . a @xmath11 halogen lamp with a dichroic reflector is used to produce a shadow graph image of the capillary bridge .",
    "optically , the fluid filament is similar to a cylindrical lens .",
    "the light beam that passes through the center of the filament is not diffracted and produces a bright line in the middle of the filament ; the light that passes close to the edges gets diffracted and so they appear dark .",
    "the optical set - up for the caber is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the filament is filmed by a @xmath12 high speed camera ( x - stream xs-5 , idt , tallahassee , usa ) at @xmath13 frame rate and @xmath14 shutter time .",
    "the camera has @xmath15 pixels with a size of @xmath16 .",
    "microscope objectives ( nikon ) with different magnifications of 10 and 20 fold were used .",
    "the latter was a long working distance objective ( @xmath17=7 mm ) with a numerical aperture of @xmath18=0.45 . at the shortest light wave length with reasonable sensitivity of the camera of @xmath19",
    "this yields a diffraction limited resolution of @xmath20=0.6@xmath21 m .",
    "such a length is magnified to 12@xmath21 m on the ccd chip .",
    "the depth of field was @xmath22 , which made it very difficult to obtain sharp images during the final stages .",
    "filaments with a thickness of the order of @xmath23 near the end of the thinning process were very sensitive to the slightest distortions caused by air currents , or showed non reproducible lateral movements in the order of several microns even when air currents were mostly suppressed by an additional glass box around the capillary bridge .",
    "calibration with a reference object is needed in order to carry out this measurement method correctly . for this",
    "propose we use an optical glass fiber manufactured by nu - fern , with specified diameter of @xmath24 .",
    "with @xmath25 the characteristic time scale ( red line ) .",
    "the events between 3 and 4 correspond to the formation of the first bead at the lower end of the filament .",
    "the first generation of beads on the filament appear between 4 and 5 ; from 5 to 6 the filament thins linearly . ]",
    "our sample solution was a 1000 or 2000 ppm polyethylene oxide ( peo ) with a mw of @xmath26 amu dissolved in water .",
    "its physical properties under elongation are reported in several publications @xcite .",
    "figure [ timeline ] shows the evolution of the fluid capillary bridge .",
    "after the filament is formed , one sees exponential shrinking until it becomes unstable to a rayleigh - plateau instability and then a final pinch off which is governed by self - similar laws . at this stage ,",
    "the shrinking of the filament follows a linear law @xcite .",
    "both time periods , the exponential thinning between the numbers 1 and 2 , and the linear thinning between 5 and 6 are indicated with the corresponding fitting curves ( red lines ) , and the first wavy surface distortion on the filament ( sinusoidal waves or single droplets ) appears between the numbers 3 and 4 ; the first generation of beads is visible in the photographs from 4 and 5 .",
    "we analyze the intensity profile of diffracted light at the edge of an object , i.e. the capillary bridge .",
    "the intensity distribution of the electromagnetic light field around the object is imaged by the microscope lens on the cmos chip . and we and we only have to evaluate the near field by use of fresnel theory @xcite by considering a white illumination",
    ". the calculation should take into account the integration over the spectral range that is determined by the cmos chip sensitivity . in our case",
    ", it is the range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 nm , with a peak around @xmath29 nm and still non negligible sensitivity in the near infra - red .    in principle , for the light source we have to consider the differential radiant energy density of a black body    @xmath30    with @xmath31 the planck s constant , @xmath32 the boltzmann s constant , @xmath33 the speed of light , @xmath34 the frequency of the light , and we estimate a temperature of @xmath35=3000k .",
    "however , our halogen spot is equipped with a dichroic mirror and in this combination the spectrum is better approximated by the rectangular window function , which is @xmath36 around a central wave length @xmath4 within the wide band @xmath7@xmath4 and @xmath37 outside this range .",
    "we define the two fresnel integrals    @xmath38    when the midsection of the liquid filament is at a distance p from a point source , the intensity distribution at a point p(q , x ) with q being the distance from the filament along the optical axes and @xmath5 the one perpendicular to it is given by @xmath39    with @xmath40 the intensity of the incoming light and the auxiliary function    @xmath41    for our case where the light source is far away from the filament compared to the near field ( @xmath42 ) it follows that :    @xmath43    for the experimental data evaluation q is taken as a fit parameter . in principle one would have to integrate q over the thickness of the depth of field but our main interest lies in the steep first flank of the first fresnel peak that is not sensitive to this integration procedure and instead we can fit a kind of effective q.    we still have to determine the bandwidth @xmath44 of the light source ; the set of curves for different values of @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "[ wideband ] .",
    "again we find that the rising flank of the first fresnel peak is not sensitive to @xmath44 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ wideband ] the theoretical curve for @xmath45 is compared to the experimental result for the profile of a human hair from fig .",
    "[ fresnelbeugung ] .",
    "similar agreement between the measured points and these calculations is observed for an optical fiber in fig .",
    "[ fresnelfiber ] .     .",
    "the inset shows the measurement for a section of the human hair of fig .",
    "[ fresnelbeugung ] by folding the two edges together ( right and left triangles ) and comparing with the calculated pattern for a band width @xmath7@xmath4= @xmath46 nm around the peak intensity wave length of @xmath47 of our cmos - chip . ]",
    "fold objective under white light illumination . left : measured points for one of the edges of the optical fiber and calculated ( line ) intensity distribution around the optical fiber for a band width @xmath7@xmath48 nm with central wave length @xmath49 nm .",

    "as q is a fitting parameter , the technique works best if we calibrate the set - up with an object of known dimensions and geometry .",
    "therefore , we measure an optical fiber ( nu - fern , with well known specifications ( fig .",
    "[ fresnelfiber ] ) .",
    "the calibration is not only to introduce the length scale into our algorithm , but also for mapping the optical aberration of the @xmath1 fold objective .     along the @xmath50- axis of the fiber shown in fig .",
    "[ fresnelfiber ] . ]    for this calibration , in front of the objective we set up a hanging optical fiber with a weight glued on one end that acts as a plumb line .",
    "this allow us to assume the fiber is a straight line , thus we are able to map the optical aberration by moving this vertical in front of the lens .",
