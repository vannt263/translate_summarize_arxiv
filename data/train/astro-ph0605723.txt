    "2005 ) , the precise influence of the secondary on the outflowing gas , and in particular its role in shaping the bipolar nebula@xmath3the homunculus@xmath3is only poorly understood .",
    "the @xmath4 homunculus ( smith et al .  2003 ) was formed during the 1837 - 1856 great eruption , and is now expanding outward at a velocity of @xmath5 ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "the similarity of the homunculus morphology to the morphologies of many planetary nebulae and symbiotic nebulae suggests that during the great eruption the secondary accreted mass from the primary along the entire orbit and blew two jets , which shaped the homunculus ( soker 2001 ; 2004 ) . unlike the case during the 19th century great eruption , presently the companion does not accrete mass during most of its orbital motion .",
    "however , recently soker ( 2005a , b ) has suggested that for several weeks near periastron passages the secondary does accrete mass from the primary .",
    "this accretion shuts down the secondary s wind , hence the x - ray emission , leading to the long x - ray minimum ( soker 2005a , b ; akashi et al .",
    "the formation of an accretion disk in the present day @xmath1 car binary system ( albeit only for a short time ; soker 2003 , 2005a ) is in agreement with some of the suggestions made earlier by van genderen et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "according to the accretion model , the basic accretion process near periastron passages is as follows ( soker 2005b ) : the collision between the two winds creates ( two ) shock waves that heat the winds to x - ray temperatures , which later escape the system .",
    "the post - shock primary wind material cools to a very low temperature , @xmath6 , and is prone to instabilities that might lead to the formation of dense blobs .",
    "while during most of the 5.54  years orbital period the secondary s gravity has a negligible effect on the winds , near periastron the collision region is close to the secondary star , and the secondary s gravitational field becomes significant , to the extent that the primary wind falls onto the secondary , which in turn accretes primary wind fragments .",
    "namely , near periastron passage the collision region of the two winds is assumed to collapse on the secondary star , a process that is further assumed to shut down the secondary wind ( soker 2005b ) .",
    "this substantially reduces the x - ray luminosity ( akashi et al .",

    "these estimates are associated with large uncertainties since most likely the secondary underwent a massive accretion event @xmath31  yr ago ( soker 2001 ) and hence it is likely to be out of thermal equilibrium .",

    "consequently , we assume a fixed temperature of @xmath50 . the velocity , density , and the temperature profiles of the wind model are plotted in the upper panel of figure [ accf ] . the bottom panel shows the column density and optical depth into the wind .",

    ", the results of sk90 imply that the x - rays do not penetrate the wind deep enough to influence the mass loss rate .",
    "however , the x - rays do ionize the wind , and by that reduce the efficiency of the radiative acceleration of the wind . hence , with the presence of x - rays , the wind in the acceleration zone is slower and denser .",
    "the important parameter that determines the wind ionization by x - rays is the photoionization parameter , which is define as ( sk90 ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance from the x - ray source and @xmath77 the nucleon number density .",
    "we are interested in the effect of photoionization by the primary and secondary shocked winds on gas just off the surface of the secondary , where its wind is launched .",

    "the resulting ionization parameter as a function of orbital phase is drawn in the third row of figure [ lxf ] for photoionization due to both the primary ( @xmath82 , thick line ) and secondary ( @xmath83 , thin line ) shocked winds .",
    "learning from the results of sk90 ( their figure 8 and table 2 ) who use a temperature of 10  kev for the x - ray emitting gas , which is similar to that of the shocked secondary wind , we find that for @xmath84 , a typical region where the he  ii  @xmath8  emission forms , the x - rays start slowing down the secondary wind when @xmath85 erg  s@xmath86  cm . for @xmath87 erg  s@xmath86",

    ". the mass loss rate does not change .",
    "therefore , without considering other effects , the third row in figure [ lxf ] suggests that the secondary wind will slow down and become denser approximately between phase -0.05 and + 0.04 .",
    "we postulate that at this time , the he  ii  @xmath8 line intensity will be enhanced .",
    "when x - ray absorption by the secondary wind is taken into account , the effect of the soft x - rays from the shocked primary wind ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) is eliminated . the proton column density from infinity to the relevant region @xmath92",
    "is @xmath93 . for this column density ,",
    "practically all x - ray emission below @xmath94 ( e.g. , primary shocked wind ) will thus be absorbed before reaching this region . only the much harder x - rays emanating from the shocked _ secondary _ wind can reach @xmath92 and effect the secondary wind by means of @xmath83 . sk90",
    "consider both absorption and harder x - ray radiation . to estimate the influence of absorption on the secondary wind x - rays we compare figure 6 of sk90 with their figure 1 , and for harder x - ray emission their figure 7 with figure 1 .",
    "crudely , a column density of @xmath93 reduces @xmath83 by a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "our assumptions , on the other hand underestimate @xmath91 : ( @xmath96 ) the optical depth should actually be calculated from @xmath97 inward , making its real value smaller , and the influence of the x - ray emission higher . however , for our goal it is adequate to use the column density from infinity and to avoid unnecessary complications , remembering that we overestimate x - ray absorption by the secondary wind .",
    "( @xmath98 ) we also underestimate the influence of the x - ray emission by taking the x - ray source to be at the stagnation point , at a distance @xmath22 from the center of the secondary .",
    "the secondary wind shock wave is actually closer to the secondary than the contact discontinuity surface , by a factor of @xmath99 ( akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) . over all",
    ", we estimate that the third row of figure [ lxf ] overestimates @xmath100 by a factor of @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is negligible after absorption ) . considering the many uncertainties involved",
    ", we cautiously propose that as periastron passage approaches , say after orbital phase @xmath103 , i.e. 100 days within periastron passage , the x - ray emission from the shocked wind can slow down the secondary wind by up to a few 10% .",
    "venero et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the he  ii  @xmath8 emission line intensity is sensitive to the wind temperature and increases as the wind temperature increases and/or as the region of maximum temperature in the wind moves outward .",
    "we therefore examine the heating of the wind by the x - ray . we neglect heating by the optical+uv energy flux of the primary star because the primary optical+uv spectrum is similar to that of the secondary star , but its flux is much smaller than the secondary flux in the relevant region at @xmath84 .",
    "the x - ray emission , on the other hand , is much harder and it ionizes the gas and heats it .    as can be seen in figure (",
    "15 ) of venero et al .",

    "the particle number loss rate by the wind in the hemisphere facing the x - ray source is @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the mean mass per particle .",
    "therefore , the x - rays raise the wind temperature by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the boltzmann constant . near the he  ii @xmath04686 maximum @xmath110 , and even for @xmath111 efficiency , @xmath112",

    "grady et al .  ( 1983 ) argue that the he  ii  @xmath8 line intensity variability is connected to changes in the entire wind acceleration zone .",
    "the changes in the acceleration zone can be in the ionization balance , and the mass loss rate ( e.g. , venero et al .",
    "kunasz ( 1980 ) found that when the he  ii  @xmath8 line is only slightly in emission it is very sensitive to the wind parameters .",
    "this is most likely the case in @xmath1 car , where the he ii @xmath8 does not exist most of the time , and appears only several months before the spectroscopic event ( m2006 ) .",
    "late wnl stars , whose hydrogen abundance is low by a factor of a few relative to solar , are also known to be strong he  ii  @xmath8 emitters , with line luminosity of up to several@xmath148 ( crowther 2000 ) .",
    "this sensitivity of the he  ii  @xmath8 to wind parameters under particular conditions , implies that the variations in this line might come with unnoticeable variations in other lines .",
    "furthermore , time variability in some lines in wr stars are known to be unrelated to variability in the he  ii  @xmath8 line , e.g. , nv  @xmath149 and c  iv  @xmath150 ( morel et al . 1999 ) . in a sample of seven o stars",
    "ninkov et al . (",
    "1987 ) find the variation in the equivalence width of the c  iii  @xmath151 line from star to star to be unrelated to the variation in the equivalence width of the he  ii  @xmath8 line .",
    "the variation of the n  iii  @xmath152 ( multiplet ) is also weakly related to the he  ii  @xmath8 line .",
    "different lines are formed at different locations in the wind , and therefore are influenced differently as the system approaches periastron .",
    "indeed , rauw et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied the o7.5i+on9.7i binary system hd  149404 , and found the he  ii  @xmath8 , c  iii  @xmath151 , n  iii  @xmath152 , n  iii  @xmath153 and s  iv  @xmath154 lines to originate from different locations in the binary system .",
    "rauw et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find temporal and spacial correlations between the he  ii  @xmath8 line and h@xmath155 in the very massive binary system wr20a ( wn6 ha + wn6 ha ) .",
    "we therefore do not necessarily expect variability in the intensity of all other lines to follow that of the he  ii  @xmath8 line , although it is possible that some lines show qualitatively similar behavior .    comparing the properties of these o stars from the literature and that of @xmath1 car",
    ", we suggest that the he  ii  @xmath8 line is formed in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind . that the he  ii  @xmath124  line originates in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind has been proposed by sd04 .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between our model and their s . in our model ,",
    "the energy source for the he line is the outflowing secondary wind and not the x - ray emission as suggested by sd04 .",
    "the energy in the he  ii line is negligible compared with the kinetic energy of the wind , and as with the o stars mentioned above , the energy in the he  ii  @xmath8 line results from excitation and ionization processes within the accelerated wind .",
    "therefore , there is no energy budget crisis in our model .",
    "the assumption that the he  ii line results in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind accounts for the behavior of the he  ii  @xmath8 emission line as follows .",
    "( @xmath96 ) _ no emission . _ during most of the orbit the conditions in the secondary wind are such that the line is very weak .",
    "( theoretical calculations by kunasz ( 1980 ) show that the line might even appear in absorption . )",
    "however , the conditions are such that a slight increase in the density and/or temperature in the acceleration zone will lead he  ii  @xmath8 to show up in emission .",
    "( @xmath98 ) _ slow rise . _",
    "as the two stars approach each other the ionization parameter ( @xmath83 ) due to the secondary x - rays increases such that enough x - ray penetrates to the acceleration zone , i.e. , the ionization parameter in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind exceeds 10@xmath156 erg  s@xmath86  cm .",
    "consequently , the wind speed decreases while the mass loss rate is unaffected , as discussed in section 2.3.1 .",
    "this results in a higher density in the acceleration zone , which based on the results of kunasz ( 1980 ) , increases the intensity of the he  ii  @xmath8 emission line .",
    "in addition , the x - rays raise the wind temperature by several@xmath157 ( section 2.3.2 ) .",
    "this slightly higher wind temperature also increases the he  ii  @xmath8 line intensity ( venero et al .",
    "we note that it is sufficient for the mass loss rate ( kunasz 1980 ) or the temperature in the wind s acceleration zone ( venero et al .",
    "2002 ) to increase slightly in order to substantially strengthen the he  ii line .",
    "the full modelling of these processes require a stellar structure code and are much beyond the scope of the present paper , but the results of the previous section do suggest that the x - ray emission from the colliding wind can influence the wind speed and temperature , which in turn can drastically change the he  ii  @xmath8 line intensity .",
    "another effect , not treated in the previous section , is the possibility that dense blobs are accreted from the post - shock primary wind region ( soker 2005b ) .",
    "as these blobs fall into the secondary wind acceleration region , they will form shock waves in the secondary wind .",
    "this will further heat the wind and in a limited region would further enhance the he  ii line .",
    "( @xmath119 ) _ peak . _",
    "according to our model , for @xmath7  days , the secondary accretes from the primary wind ( soker 2005b ) after the collapse of the shocked primary wind material in the region of the stagnation point onto the secondary .",
    "as we show below , this gas has high specific angular momentum .",
    "the collapse starts at phase @xmath120 , namely , @xmath121 days before periastron passage ( akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) ; the x - ray minimum starts at phase @xmath158 .",
    "since most of the gas is first accreted near the equatorial plane around the secondary , for a limited time it collimates the secondary wind towards the polar directions .",
    "the higher density in this collimated wind further enhances the intensity of the he  ii  @xmath8 line by a large factor ( kunasz 1980 ) , leading to the peak in the he ii @xmath8 line intensity .",
    "this collimated wind could also be the low - energy analog of the x - ray jet ( behar et al .",
    "after the short peak , the secondary wind is totally shut down ( soker 2005b ; akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) , and hence the he  ii  @xmath8 line as well as the x - rays are shut down as well .",
    "after periastron when the secondary wind is resurrected ( and the x - rays return ) the secondary wind is back to its initial pre - accretion form , where the he  ii line does not exist . in this phase",
    "we expect to see only the blue - shifted ( approaching ) side of the collimated wind .",
    "the reason is that the inclination of   is @xmath159 ( i.e. , the orbital plane is tilted by @xmath160 from an edge - on view ; smith 2002 ) , and the he  ii  @xmath8 line is formed very close to the stellar surface , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the star itself will block most of the he  ii  @xmath8 red - shifted line , and the rest will be blocked by the dense region at the base of the wind at @xmath161 .",
    "the sharp decrease of the the he  ii  @xmath8 line by a factor of @xmath162 over about 10 days is accounted for by ( 1 ) the quick dying out of the secondary wind ; and ( 2 ) the speed of the secondary wind entering the shock is much lower . the lower speed is due to the x - ray ionization and heating and also due to the stagnation region moves closer into the acceleration zone . the x - ray radiation will therefore be softer , hence absorbed more , hence a lesser affect on the acceleration zone .",
    "we note that m2006 briefly mention that the line might be formed by the winds of the two stars ; they mainly consider the primary wind .",
    "however , m2006 assume that the he  ii emission originates from photoionized regions near the x - ray shock fronts .",
    "the problem with this assumption , as noted by m2006 , is that the he  ii  @xmath8 line peak occurs well after the x - ray emission has started to drop .",
    "sd04 also considered this possibility , but they also considered an alternative , where the he  ii  @xmath8 originates in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind .",
    "we agree with this second suggestion of sd04 .",
    "we end this subsection by emphasizing again three points of our model .",
    "( 1 ) the he  ii  @xmath8 is formed in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind . the sensitivity of this line to wind properties ( kunasz 1980 ; venero et al .",
    "2002 ) implies that changes in only a fraction of the acceleration zone can lead to a large variation in the line intensity .",
    "( 2 ) the primary star has no direct role in the changes in the he  ii line properties ; its only role is in supplying the gas that collides with the secondary wind , leading to x - ray emission , and in supplying the accreted gas during the accretion phase .",
    "( 3 ) the energy in the he  ii line comes from the wind and the secondary star .",
    "both the kinetic power in the secondary wind and the secondary luminosity are much larger than the maximum he  ii line luminosity .",
    "therefore , there is no problem in supplying the energy to this line .",
    "we show now that the gas in the stagnation point has indeed enough specific angular momentum to be accreted from the equatorial plane , which could form a collimated wind , or even two opposite jets .",
    "we take the shocked primary wind near the stagnation point to move slowly relative to the stagnation point , hence it is corotating with the binary orbit at an angular velocity @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the binary relative velocity at periastron and @xmath165 is the orbital separation at periastron .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the matter near the stagnation point around the secondary is @xmath166 . for the relevant orbital phases we see from figure 1 that @xmath167 , from which we find @xmath168 . to check the degree by which the accretion onto the secondary depart from sphericity , and whether an accretion disk might form , @xmath169 should be compared with the specific angular momentum of a test particle performing keplerian motion on the secondary equator @xmath170 . substituting @xmath171 , @xmath172 ( figure 1 ) , and @xmath10 we find @xmath173 this shows that the collapsing material at the beginning of the accretion phase ( and only at the beginning , before the bondi - hoyle type accretion takes place ) has large enough specific angular momentum such that most of the gas is accreted from near the equator .",
    "this will force the secondary wind to flow along the poles , hence having a much higher density at the wind base .",
    "such a high density might substantially increase the he  ii  @xmath8 line luminosity ( kunasz 1980 ) . shortly after the collapse stage , the secondary wind is shut down , reducing to zero the he  ii  @xmath8 line and the x - ray emission .",
    "formation of an accretion disk is marginal , and more accurate calculations are required to check whether an accretion disk can be formed , and whether two opposite jets might be launched .",
    "this ends our explanation to the he ii @xmath8 emission peak .",
    "in the present paper we continue to explore the different aspects of the winds interaction in the massive binary system and study the anomalously high he  ii @xmath04686 line appearing just before periastron and quickly disappearing immediately thereafter . based on the he  ii @xmath04686 line emission from o - stars and their modelling in the literature",
    ", we postulate that the he  ii @xmath04686 line comes from the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind .",
    "the large increase in the he  ii @xmath04686 line intensity is attributed to small changes in the properties of the secondary stellar wind .",
    "we suggest that the formation and acceleration of the secondary stellar wind is affected by the winds interaction in two ways .",
    "the first effect is due to the enhanced x - rays emitted by the shocked secondary wind .",
    "the secondary stellar wind is shocked as it encounter the primary stellar wind .",
    "the x - ray emission could reduce the acceleration of the secondary stellar wind ( section 2.3.1 ; sk90 ) , and hence increase its density in the acceleration zone , which also heats the wind . under the appropriate conditions , which we suggest exist in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind in , higher density ( kunasz 1980 ) and/or higher temperature ( venero et al .",
    "2002 ) increase the intensity of the he  ii  @xmath8 line emission .",
    "the second effect is due to the accreted primary stellar wind , which affects the geometry of the secondary wind .",
    "close to periastron passage , the secondary star starts to accrete from the shocked primary stellar wind ( soker 2005b ; akashi et al .",
    "because of the high specific angular momentum of this accreted gas ( eq . [ j21 ] ) , it will be accreted from near the equatorial plane .",
    "the equatorial accreted mass will collimate the secondary wind along the polar directions , and might even form an accretion disk and launch two opposite transient jets , as suggested recently by x - ray observations ( behar et al .",
    "the polar outflow from the secondary will have much higher densities than the isotropic wind , and it is , therefore , expected to be a much stronger he  ii  @xmath8 emitter .    our explanation for the temporal evolution of the he  ii  @xmath8 line is given in section 3.2 .",
    "the presently proposed explanation for the he  ii @xmath04686 high intensity disputes previous ones ( sd04 ; m2006 ) , which entailed photoionization of he exclusively by the x - rays .",
    "we agree , on the other hand , with the other suggestion of sd04 that the he  ii  @xmath8 line originates in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind , and that the slow rise to maximum occurs on the side facing the winds interaction zone . the high observed intensity of over 10@xmath174 line photons emitted over a period of about 20 days , and while the x - ray flux is sharply dropping , imply a prohibitively high photoionizing x - ray flux , which the present model does not require .",
    "finally , we note that the influence of the x - ray emission on the secondary stellar wind , in making its velocity lower , will cause the stagnation point to be closer to the secondary star compared with assumptions made in earlier papers in the series ( soker 2005b ; akashi et al .",
    "although this effect is not large , it reinforces accretion of primary shocked wind material near periastron , the key element in the accretion model .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for useful comments .",
