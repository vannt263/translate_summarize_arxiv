    "the thermal analysis of a spacecraft is important to ensure that the temperatures of its elements are kept within their appropriate ranges @xcite .",
    "this analysis is usually carried out numerically by commercial computer software packages .",
    "these software packages employ `` lumped parameter '' models that describe the spacecraft as a discrete network of nodes , with one heat - balance equation per node .",
    "the equations for the thermal state evolution are coupled nonlinear first order differential equations , which can be integrated numerically .",
    "given the thermal parameters of the model and its initial state , the numerical integration of the differential equations provides the solution of the problem , namely , it yields the evolution of the node temperatures .",
    "however , it does not provide any information on the qualitative behavior of the set of solutions nor knowledge of the response of the model to changes in the parameter values .",
    "besides , a detailed model with many nodes is difficult to handle , and its integration for a sufficiently long time of evolution can take considerable computer time and resources .",
    "therefore , it is very useful to study , on the one hand , simplified models with few nodes that lend themselves to analytic solutions , and , on the other hand , the reduction of complex models to simpler ones .",
    "these studies are especially helpful early in the design process , when the concept of the spacecraft is still open , and also at the end of the process , to simplify the full thermal model for the final assessment of the mission .",
    "the differential equations for heat balance are nonlinear due to the presence of radiative couplings , which involve the fourth powers of the temperatures ( according to the stefan - boltzmann law of thermal radiation ) .",
    "the computation of steady states , in particular , boils down to the solution of a set of fourth - degree algebraic equations .",
    "most analytical approaches to the solution of the heat balance equations , either for transient or steady states , involve a sort of linearization of the radiative couplings such that they become analogous to conductive couplings @xcite .",
    "but one must beware that the `` radiative conductances '' so defined actually depend on the temperatures ( the unknown variables ) .",
    "therefore , the linearization procedure is sound only when those radiative conductances can be considered constant , namely , when the temperatures are sufficiently close to their steady state values .",
    "we can see , in particular , that the linear equations are not suitable for calculating the steady state values of the temperatures .",
    "moreover , one may question that the steady state is unique . even assuming that it is and that the steady state temperatures are known , the linear equations are not suitable in the presence of variable external heat inputs of such a magnitude that they make the node temperatures depart considerably from their steady state values .    for the given reasons ,",
    "it is advisable to study the full nonlinear equations and only consider their linearization once we have a qualitative understanding of the possible behavior of their solutions .",
    "this is the philosophy applied in our preceding work @xcite .",
    "the present work continues the development of nonlinear analytic methods for the study of simple models of spacecrafts ( in particular , satellites ) that we have begun in ref .",
    "we study there the simplest model , namely , a one - node ( isothermal ) model . in that case , the steady state temperature is obtained at once , the heat - balance equation without external heat input is integrable in terms of known functions , and the equation with periodic external heat input admits a full qualitative analysis .",
    "naturally , as we increase the number of nodes , the corresponding systems of equations become increasingly difficult to handle . indeed , a two - node model is already of such a complexity that the existing studies of this model are based on some sort of linearization : oshima & oshima @xcite assume radiative conductances that depend on a temperature @xmath0 that is `` to be defined in each problem , '' whereas prez - grande et al @xcite choose the temperature on which the conductance between two nodes depends to be an average of the two nodes temperatures . thus , prez - grande et al s radiative conductances are not really constant . in any event , both procedures are somewhat arbitrary and , in fact , only agree if the temperatures are sufficiently close to their steady state values and , in addition , all the temperatures are almost equal in the steady state .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to provide a _ nonlinear _ analysis of a two - node model of a small compact satellite in a low orbit and to generalize this analysis to a many - node thermal model of a spacecraft .",
    "we employ prez - grande et al s two - node satellite model @xcite , in which the two nodes are formed by the satellite s interior and its outer shell ( its `` skin '' ) . therefore , the model consists in a system of two energy - balance ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) ,",
    "in which both nodes are thermally coupled to one another but only the outer shell radiates heat away . naturally , this two - node model is more general than the one - node model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it reduces to the latter if the thermal coupling between the satellite s interior and its outer shell is strong , as we show here . on the other hand , if the thermal coupling is weak , the two - node model can significantly differ from the one - node model .",
    "in fact , the corresponding system of two non - autonomous ode s for this two - node model under periodic heat input is equivalent to an autonomous system of three ode s , to which the qualitative methods of ref .",
    "@xcite are not applicable and which could have chaotic behavior and very complicated attractors , as is well known @xcite .",
    "we consider this possibility here .",
    "a general many - node thermal model of a spacecraft consists in a system of many energy - balance ode s . as a first step in this generalization , we find it useful to study the general two - node model in which both nodes radiate heat away .",
    "this model already requires the use of sophisticated mathematical methods , but its temperature space is still two - dimensional , allowing us to obtain stronger results than for the fully general case .",
    "the fully general many - node thermal model presents some difficulties already in a linear analysis , for we have to deal with nontrivial high - dimensional matrices .",
    "an important issue in the study of a differential equation is the stability of its solutions .",
    "as regards autonomous equations , it is important to determine the stability of their equilibrium states ( steady states ) . for non - autonomous equations",
    ", one may consider the more general question of the stability of a given trajectory under a perturbation of the initial conditions , where stability is normally interpreted in the sense of lyapunov @xcite .",
    "a different notion of stability is _ structural stability _",
    ", which refers to the entire set of solutions and means that its qualitative character is `` robust '' against perturbations @xcite .",
    "we study the stability of the heat balance equations , namely , the question of the stability of the steady states of the autonomous equations and the related question of the stability of the limit cycle of the general equations with periodic heat input .",
    "we also study the structural stability of the equations under a variation of the heat inputs .",
    "thus , our goal is to carry out a fairly complete study of the lumped parameter thermal models employed in the thermal analysis of spacecrafts .",
    "prez - grande et al s two - node satellite model is studied in sect .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , where the energy balance equations are formulated as a system of two non - dimensional ode , which are nonlinear and non - autonomous .",
    "then , we consider an autonomous system that plays the role of a time average of the actual system .",
    "the analysis of the autonomous system begins with the calculation of its steady states , finding only a physically relevant one , namely , a stable sink of the ode system s flow . two examples with different parameters , corresponding to strong and weak thermal coupling , are solved numerically . after introducing the thermal driving , we employ a perturbation method that generalizes the method in ref .",
    "@xcite and we corroborate its results numerically . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the general @xmath1-node model and then study the corresponding autonomous system , beginning with the general two - node model .",
    "we prove that the results for the restricted two - node model hold for the general two - node model and , furthermore , that most of those results can be extended to the general @xmath1-node model . finally , we present our conclusions , regarding the design of spacecraft .",
    "a lumped - parameter thermal model of a continuous system describes the system as a discrete network of isothermal regions ( _ nodes _ ) that represent a partition of the thermal capacitance of the system and that are linked by conductive and radiative thermal couplings @xcite .",
    "the equation governing the conductive heat transfer is the standard fourier partial differential equation .",
    "this pde is actually employed for thermal modelling of simple spacecraft geometries , treating the external radiative heat input and heat dissipation as boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "however , when we consider the radiative thermal coupling between different parts of a spacecraft , we have a much more complex situation : the internal radiative couplings are not a boundary condition and are _ non - local _ , thus giving rise to an integro - differential equation for the heat transfer .",
    "the discretization of this equation in terms of a lumped - parameter model is a very convenient approach .    in a lumped - parameter thermal model ,",
    "there is one heat - balance ode per node controlling the evolution of its temperature .",
    "a single - node model , suitable for a small and compact satellite , has been first studied by oshima & oshima @xcite and has been revisited by tsai @xcite .",
    "oshima & oshima @xcite also study the two - node model , but they linearize it from the outset and assume constant heat inputs . here , we focus on prez - grande et al s two - node satellite model @xcite , with one node corresponding to the satellite s outer shell and the other to its interior .",
    "this model allows for a periodic time dependence of the heat inputs . to be precise",
    ", the heat input to the satellite s shell consists , on the one hand , of the periodic solar irradiation and the planetary albedo , and , on the other hand , of the constant planetary ir radiation .",
    "the internal heat is due to the equipment dissipation and is taken constant .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote , respectively , the outer and inner node temperatures ; then , the energy balance equations for them are @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the thermal capacities of the two satellite s nodes , @xmath7 is the orbital frequency , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the conductive and radiative couplings , respectively , @xmath10 is the satellite s surface area , @xmath11 its emissivity , and @xmath12 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the heat inputs are written as @xmath13 with a subscript that denotes their type , namely , solar irradiation , albedo , planetary ir radiation , or internal heat dissipation .",
    "the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are periodic with period one and give the time variations of the respective heat inputs .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by : @xmath16 the values of @xmath17 , alternating between one and zero , correspond to the orbit in the sunshine or eclipse , respectively . the fraction of the period in the sunshine or eclipse is determined by @xmath18 , which is smaller than one half .",
    "its value depends on the angle between the orbital plane and the solar vector @xcite .",
    "the albedo heat input has a more complex time dependence , due to the change of the _ view factor _ from the whole satellite to the lit side of the planet along the orbit : the maximum albedo occurs at the minimum angle between the satellite s local vertical and the solar vector , and it diminishes as the angle grows .",
    "the sinusoidal dependence assumed for @xmath19 is a suitable approximation of the actual dependence @xcite .",
    "one must further assume that the fraction of the period with albedo heat input , namely , @xmath20 , is such that @xmath21 .",
    "the solar irradiation heat input to the satellite is the product of the solar constant , the satellite surface s absorptivity and its projected area ( which we take to be a quarter of its total area ) ; namely , @xmath22 the albedo varies with time , as the atmospheric conditions and other factors change , so one must consider an average value . to calculate @xmath23 ,",
    "it is necessary , in addition , to consider the already mentioned view factor , for the reflected light does not impinge on the satellite uniformly .",
    "this has the consequence of reducing the effective area to about a half of its nominal value when the sun is just above the satellite .",
    "therefore , the maximum albedo heat input is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the average albedo coefficient .",
    "the planetary ir irradiation heat input is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the planet s ( earth s ) blackbody - equivalent temperature , the projected area is a half of the real area ( like for albedo absorption ) , and the satellite s surface ir absorptivity is taken equal to its ir emissivity @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 derives from the planet s heat balance equation @xcite @xmath28 the standard value of the average albedo coefficient of the earth is @xmath29 , which gives @xmath30 ( using the value of @xmath31 in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "k. ] in conclusion , the ir irradiation heat input can be computed with the formula : @xmath32    prez - grande et al s two - node thermal model is applicable to micro - satellites .",
    "specifically , we have in mind a micro - satellite with the shape of a cube of @xmath33  m side and with mass of about 50  kg , mostly covered by solar cells .",
    "the relevant values of the satellite and orbital parameters for two model examples are collected in table  [ tab1 ] and employed in sects .",
    "[ num ] and [ num - sol ] .",
    "we can write equations ( [ dimode_1 ] ) and ( [ dimode_2 ] ) in a non - dimensional form by defining @xmath34 and defining non - dimensional temperature variables @xmath35 and a time variable @xmath36 ( which is still denoted by @xmath37 for notational simplicity )",
    ". refers now to the thermal conductance while the non - dimensional heat inputs are denoted by @xmath38 with the corresponding subscript ; and @xmath39 denotes the constant that before was named @xmath25 ( since @xmath25 is now reserved for the albedo coefficient ) .",
    "] thus , we obtain the non - dimensional ode s @xmath40 this system of two non - autonomous nonlinear ode s is difficult to solve . as a first step ,",
    "we remove the oscillating terms by averaging @xmath14 and @xmath15 , like in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if @xmath41 denotes the time average of the external heat input @xmath42 , then the averaging of the dynamical equations ( [ ode_1 ] ) and ( [ ode_2 ] ) results in the autonomous system : @xmath43 instead of the one - node model averaged equation @xcite , which is straightforward to solve , we have now a system of _ two _ autonomous nonlinear ode s",
    ". the standard way of analyzing these systems begins with the localization of their fixed points @xcite .",
    "the fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ avode_1 ] ) and ( [ avode_2 ] ) are the solutions of two fourth degree algebraic equations .",
    "these two equations can be solved by first eliminating one unknown , namely , @xmath44 , as is easily done by adding both equations , which yields @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the outer node temperature is given by @xmath46 .",
    "it only depends on the total heat input , like the steady state temperature in the one - node model @xcite .",
    "once @xmath47 is known , we can substitute for it in one of the algebraic equations , say the second one , to obtain a fourth degree algebraic equation for @xmath48 namely , @xmath49 according to the fundamental theorem of algebra @xcite , this equation has four complex roots ( solutions ) , of which an even number ( 0 , 2 or 4 ) are real .",
    "we are interested in just the real positive roots . to this end",
    ", we apply descartes s rule of signs , which says that no equation can have more positive roots than it has changes of signs in the coefficients @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is only one change of sign , so there is one positive root at the most . if we replace @xmath50 in the equation , we also deduce that there is one negative root at the most . therefore , the equation can have a positive and a negative root or no real roots at all .",
    "given that the corresponding polynomial is positive for @xmath51 and becomes negative as @xmath52 , there is at the least one real root .",
    "thus , the equation must have a positive and a negative root , in addition to a pair of complex conjugate roots .",
    "the equation @xmath53 also has a positive root , a negative root , and a pair of complex conjugate roots , but these are just the four complex fourth roots of a positive real number .",
    "when we consider the two fourth - degree equations together , the total number of roots is @xmath54 , but only one has positive @xmath47 and @xmath44 .",
    "the positive root of eq .",
    "( [ eq4qi ] ) has a complicated expression in terms of radicals of the coefficients of the equation @xcite . assuming that the coefficients have numerical values , it is much more convenient to find the root by numerical methods .",
    "the existence of one and only one couple of positive steady - state temperatures is , of course , in accord with our physical intuition .",
    "in fact , one may wonder why there are other real solutions with negative absolute temperatures and why the flow given by eqs .",
    "( [ avode_1 ] ) and ( [ avode_2 ] ) crosses the axes @xmath55 or @xmath51 . in this regard ,",
    "let us notice that those equations are not valid when @xmath47 or @xmath44 vanish , because the thermal capacities @xmath5 and @xmath6 can only be taken constant in an interval of temperatures , which is usually long but can not be extended to zero absolute temperature .",
    "in fact , the third law of thermodynamics implies that any thermal capacity vanishes as the absolute temperature approaches zero @xcite .      to determine the stability of the steady state we have to calculate the jacobian matrix of the vector field defined by the ode s @xcite , namely , of the vector field @xmath56\\right\\}.\\ ] ]",
    "if the jacobian matrix is nonsingular , the fixed point is simple and the signs of the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix determine the nature and stability of the fixed point .",
    "in particular , if both eigenvalues are negative or , more generally , have negative real parts , the fixed point is an asymptotically stable sink , at least , locally .",
    "the jacobian matrix @xmath57 is indeed nonsingular , for @xmath58 the eigenvalue equation @xmath59 has discriminant @xmath60 it is positive , given that @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , both eigenvalues are real and different .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath62 is diagonalizable .",
    "the larger eigenvalue @xmath63 is negative if @xmath64 , that is to say , if @xmath65 , equivalent to @xmath66 . in consequence ,",
    "both eigenvalues are negative , so the fixed point is a stable sink and , to be specific , it is a node .",
    "the local asymptotic stability of the fixed point is , again , in accord with our physical intuition .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the fixed point be a _ global _ sink in the positive temperature quadrant .",
    "this can be proved with the help of bendixson s criterion @xcite : if on a simple connected region the divergence of the ode s vector field does not change sign , then the ode s has no closed trajectories lying entirely in that region .",
    "this criterion is applicable , for the divergence equals @xmath67 , which is always negative in the positive temperature quadrant .",
    "the absence of closed trajectories must be combined with the poincar - bendixson theorem @xcite , which restricts the generic behavior of an autonomous system of two first - order ode s to having `` simple '' attracting sets , namely , fixed points or limit cycles . on account of the trivial fact that the flow points towards the interior of the positive temperature quadrant",
    ", we conclude that the flow must end at its unique sink in the quadrant , which is therefore globally stable in it .      after establishing that the flow has a globally stable sink ,",
    "it is useful to see the aspect of the flow for sensible values of the parameters by plotting the ode s vector field ( [ vector ] ) .",
    "in addition , the computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the respective jacobian matrices provides a very precise local picture of the flow around the fixed points .",
    "that confirms and completes the global picture provided by the vector fields .",
    "we examine two examples : one in which the two nodes are strongly coupled ( large values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and another in which the coupling is weak ( small @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",

    "furthermore , the coefficients of the eigenvalue equation for a @xmath209 matrix are complicated polynomials in the matrix elements . as a polynomial in these matrix elements ,",
    "the discriminant has sixth degree and consists of 144 monomials with positive and negative signs .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to decide on the overall sign of this discriminant , despite that the jacobian matrix elements have definite signs .",
    "the question of whether or not the jacobian matrix is diagonalizable with _ real _ eigenvalues can be considered from a different point of view .",
    "given the expressions of the jacobian matrix elements ( [ jij ] ) and ( [ jii ] ) , the matrix is simplified somewhat by multiplying it on the left by the diagonal matrix @xmath274 , which removes the factors @xmath275 . if @xmath276 were symmetric , @xmath277 would be symmetric as well , as is easily proved .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 would be similar to a symmetric matrix and hence would be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues .",
    "the matrix elements of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of @xmath276 are , respectively , @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( for @xmath280 ) .",
    "if the latter matrix element is of small magnitude with respect to the former for each pair of nodes , then @xmath276 is nearly symmetric and @xmath62 is likely to be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues .",
    "this can be deduced by considering that the eigenvalues of a matrix and their respective eigenvectors vary continuously with the matrix elements and that the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , if a variation of the elements of a symmetric matrix is to turn two real eigenvalues into a couple of complex conjugate eigenvalues , then it must have sufficient magnitude to change the directions of the respective eigenvectors so much that they coincide .",
    "it is pertinent here to comment that the procedures used in the literature for linearizing the @xmath1-node ode s  ( [ dimode_n ] ) amount to an _ ad - hoc _ symmetrization of the matrix @xmath276 , either by assuming that the steady - state node temperatures are approximately uniform @xcite or , more accurately , by assuming that they fulfill @xmath281 , for each pair of nodes @xmath282 such that @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "we have proved above that the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath62 have negative real parts and , furthermore , we have argued that they are likely real . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the eigenvalue of smallest absolute value , corresponding to the slowest thermal mode , and we prove that , indeed , it is real .",
    "the slowest mode is especially important because it eventually determines the dynamics and the convergence to the steady state .",
    "for the proof , we appeal to perron s theorem for positive matrices : a positive matrix has a unique real and positive eigenvalue with a strictly positive eigenvector and , furthermore , that eigenvalue has maximal modulus among all the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "since the inverse of @xmath254 is non - negative , it is a good candidate for perron s theorem : if it is actually strictly positive , its maximal modulus eigenvalue corresponds to the minimal modulus eigenvalue of @xmath62 .    however , it is not easy to find whether or not the inverse of @xmath254 is strictly positive .",
    "we can apply instead the following theorem : an _ irreducible _ @xmath255-matrix is a nonsingular @xmath256-matrix if and only if its inverse is _ strictly _ positive @xcite .",
    "a matrix is said to be reducible if it can be put in a block upper - triangular form by a simultaneous permutation of its files and columns .",
    "nodes in which there is a directed edge leading from the node @xmath223 to the node @xmath226 if and only if the corresponding matrix element is non - vanishing .",
    "a graph is called _ strongly connected _ if for each pair of nodes there is a sequence of directed edges leading from the first node to the second node .",
    "a matrix is irreducible if and only if its graph is strongly connected .",
    "of course , the graph of the jacobian matrix is the one defined by the node model and the corresponding heat exchanges . ]",
    "therefore , we only need to show that @xmath62 is irreducible",
    ". it would certainly be so if @xmath284 or @xmath285 did not vanish for any pair of indices ( except when @xmath286 ) ; but some ( or many ) of the conductive and radiative couplings are expected to vanish simultaneously .",
    "let us assume that we can relabel the nodes and hence permute simultaneously the files and columns of @xmath62 to make it block upper - triangular .",
    "given that an element @xmath287 only vanishes if both @xmath284 and @xmath285 vanish , according to eq .",
    "( [ jij ] ) , both elements @xmath287 and @xmath288 vanish or do not vanish simultaneously . in consequence ,",
    "an order of nodes that makes @xmath62 block upper - triangular also makes it block diagonal .",
    "a matrix that can be put in a block diagonal form by a simultaneous permutation of its files and columns is said to be _",
    "completely reducible_. however , @xmath62 is completely reducible if and only if the node model splits into two disconnected node models , which corresponds to modelling two separated spacecrafts .    in conclusion ,",
    "the matrix @xmath62 is irreducible for a single spacecraft model and we can apply perron s theorem to @xmath289 : the largest eigenvalue of the latter corresponds to the negative eigenvalue of @xmath62 of smallest magnitude and , therefore , to the slowest variable . furthermore , the corresponding eigenvector is positive and , actually , the only positive eigenvector .",
    "therefore , the sink is eventually approached either from the zone corresponding to simultaneous temperature increments or from the zone corresponding to simultaneous temperature decrements , as already observed for the two - node models in sect .",
    "in other words , the slow mode corresponds to a simultaneous increase or decrease of the ( non - uniform ) temperature throughout the spacecraft whereas faster modes correspond to temperature increases in one or more parts of the spacecraft that are accompanied by decreases in other parts .",
    "if we assume that the heat inputs @xmath290 are periodic , the non - autonomous equations  ( [ dimode_n ] ) is a generalization of the driven two - node model studied in sects .",
    "[ forced ] and [ pertur ] .",
    "thus , we can use the equations in sect .",
    "[ pertur ] , if we replace the @xmath291 with @xmath267 and use the driving term @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the mean value of @xmath290 over the period of oscillation .",
    "the first order perturbative correction @xmath294 to the solution of the averaged equations is the solution of the system of linear ode s  ( [ linode - pert ] ) , where @xmath295 must be substituted by @xmath296 . the subsequent steps are independent of the dimension .",
    "therefore , the integral expression ( [ t_1_lim ] ) of the limit cycle holds ( after replacing @xmath297 with @xmath298 ) .",
    "if we use the basis of the eigenvectors of @xmath62 ( assuming that @xmath62 is diagonalizable ) , the limit cycle @xmath299 becomes a sum of contributions , each one corresponding to an eigenvector .",
    "in particular , if @xmath130 is the component of @xmath187 along some eigenvector with an eigenvalue @xmath300 that is large compared with the heat - input frequency , the corresponding contribution to @xmath299 is approximately equal to @xmath301 . in a many - node model",
    "such that the magnitudes of the @xmath62-eigenvalues span a long range , surely only a few of the slowest modes make significant contributions to @xmath299 .",
    "this observation suggests an effective method of computing a numerical approximation of the limit cycle : one is to begin with the contributions of the slowest modes and keep adding modes until the addend becomes negligible with respect to the partial sum .",
    "as regards the full perturbation series @xmath302 , one could be more concerned about its convergence now than in the two - node case , since we can not affirm that the steady state of the averaged system is globally stable .",
    "however , exploratory numerical work carried out for models with few nodes for various values of the parameters suggests that the steady state of the averaged system is globally stable and that the perturbation series has good convergence properties .",
    "of course , these numerical results have heuristic value only .",
    "this work is devoted to the study of the nonlinear ode s employed in spacecraft thermal control , with emphasis on analytic methods .",
    "we have first studied a satellite model consisting of two nodes , namely , the satellite s exterior and interior parts . comparing the results obtained for this model with the results for the one - node model in ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the addition of one node does not give rise to any essentially new features , as long as the heat inputs vary moderately .",
    "in fact , with constant heat input and when the thermal coupling between the two nodes is sufficiently strong , as in example 1 in subsect .",
    "[ example2 ] , the two - node model naturally evolves towards the one - node model .",
    "this evolution pattern is ascertained by two results : ( i ) the existence of a globally stable steady state in which the temperatures of the two nodes become almost equal ; and ( ii ) the appearance of a fast dynamical variable , such that the two - node model dynamics converges to a one - node model dynamics before reaching the steady state .    when the coupling between the two nodes is weak , as in example 2 in subsect .",
    "[ example2 ] , there is also a physical steady state and a fast variable , but the heat balance is reached in a more complicated way . the ratio of the inner to the outer node temperatures in the steady state is still close to one , e.g. , @xmath303 in example 2 , but the ratio between the increments of the respective temperatures , given by the positive eigenvector , can now be considerable : it is @xmath304 in example 2 . therefore , the transition to the slow dynamics does not imply that the node temperatures approach each other over the typical time of the fast variable , although they do so over the typical time of the slow variable .",
    "a periodic heat input produces nonlinear driven oscillations of the temperatures , namely , a limit cycle .",
    "this can be proved by taking the oscillating heat input as a perturbation and expanding the nonlinear system in series , thus converting it into a set of linear systems . at the first order ,",
    "the linear equation valid on long times is just the equation of driven overdamped linear oscillations and it has the standard solution .",
    "we find that the perturbative series is convergent in a range of amplitudes of the driving heat input that is sufficient for the applications .",
    "moreover , the perturbative series allows one to calculate , order by order , the limit cycle and the convergence of the temperatures to it .",
    "we have found numerical evidence of more complex behaviors , probably including quasiperiodicity and chaos , but these behaviors take place for unrealistic amplitudes of the driving heat input .",
    "most of the above conclusions can be extended to the general @xmath1-node thermal model of a spacecraft , by employing topological methods and the theory of non - negative matrices . for constant heat input",
    ", the general @xmath1-node model also has an attractive steady state in the physical region and the dynamics converges to a slow variable corresponding to a simultaneous increase or decrease of the ( non - uniform ) temperature throughout the spacecraft .",
    "however , we are unable to prove the global stability of the steady state . in this regard",
    ", we must notice that most proofs in the theory of differential equations have local nature and , in fact , global properties can only be proved with powerful mathematical tools .",
    "one such tool is the topological index , but it only provides partial information .",
    "another powerful tool is the existence of a lyapunov function @xcite : a global strict lyapunov function allows one to determine the global stability of a sink .",
    "unfortunately , there are no general methods for finding suitable lyapunov functions . for ode s with physical origin ,",
    "sometimes it is possible to find a physically motivated lyapunov function , for example , an energy , entropy , etc .",
    "thus , there could be a physically motivated lyapunov function for the @xmath1-node model ode system , but it is certainly hard to find .    when driven by a periodic heat input , the @xmath1-node model also becomes a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "but one could be more concerned about the range of convergence of the perturbative series for this model than about the series for the two - node model . at any rate , when the dynamics is confined to a neighborhood of the steady state , no high order terms of the perturbative series",
    "are needed .",
    "the amplitude of the two - node model limit cycle is indeed small and the linear first - order equation suffices ; but its steady state is , of course , globally stable anyhow . regarding @xmath1-node models , we believe that the relevant values of the parameters do not produce large amplitudes either and that the linear first - order equations may suffice .",
    "notice , however , that those equations do not coincide with previous types of linearization , in which the coefficient matrix of the ode system is forced to be related to a symmetric matrix by defining radiative conductances that depend on somewhat arbitrary temperatures ( as in refs .",
    "in contrast , the linear equations are not equivalent to the equations of a model with only conductive thermal couplings and the actual jacobian matrix of the ode system is not related to any symmetric matrix .    regarding the practical use of @xmath1-node thermal models",
    ", we must notice that the diagonalization of the jacobian matrix at the steady state usually yields ( negative ) eigenvalues of very different magnitude , like in our two examples of a two - node model .",
    "the fast variables indicate the regions of the spacecraft where the heat inputs and outputs quickly balance , establishing a dynamical balance long before the steady state is reached .",
    "the last and longest stage of this dynamical balance corresponds to the slowest variable , with definite ratios of the temperature increments .",
    "we believe that it is interesting to distinguish the response of the different modes in regard to spacecraft thermal control .",
    "standard software packages for spacecraft thermal analysis do not regard this aspect of the solution of the equations .    besides , our results have some bearing on an interesting problem of lumped - parameter models , namely , the problem of node condensation : a model is normally constructed heuristically and it can be useful to reduce its number of nodes while preserving the required performance of its design . in a spacecraft thermal model , if a couple of nodes @xmath282 are such that their steady temperatures fulfill @xmath305 and @xmath306 , it may be advisable to replace them by a single node , because that will not result in a loss of accuracy in the description of the temperature distribution . according to our results , this type of condensation can be achieved at no great computational cost : one only needs to compute the steady temperatures and then the positive eigenvector of the corresponding jacobian matrix .",
    "the determination of a spacecraft s thermal modes and their use for node condensation are beyond the scope of current thermal software packages .",
    "therefore , the analytic approach proposed here can be a useful complement to the analysis that is normally carried out with those software packages ."
