    "we consider the @xmath0-hypersurface equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean curvature , @xmath5 is the normal vector on the surface and @xmath0 is a constant .",

    "the equation arises in the gaussian isoperimetric problem : in @xmath6 , the weighted gaussian volume element and area element are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the volume element and area element induced by the euclidean metric . the gaussian isoperimetric problem asks : among all regions with the same weighted volume @xmath11 , which one has the least weighted boundary area ?",
    "the answer to this problem is given in @xcite , @xcite : the half space minimizes the weighted boundary area .",
    "the problem above can be considered locally as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 be a surface minimizing the weighted boundary area among all surfaces enclosing the same weighted volume .",
    "the surface is a critical point for all variations that fix the enclosed weighted volume .",
    "the geometry condition on @xmath12 is given by equation .",
    "this equation is defined on @xmath12 locally and it can be studied even if @xmath12 does not enclose a region .",
    "the solutions can be thought of as the critical points to the weighted area functional .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite for more detail .",
    "the @xmath0-hypersurfaces also arise in the study of the weighted volume - preserving flow by cheng and wei@xcite . note that the  weighted volume \" in their work is defined on the surface and is different from the gaussian weighted volume above .",
    "they prove that @xmath0-hypersurfaces are critical points of the weighted area functional for all weighted volume - preserving variations .",
    "the @xmath0-hypersurfaces can also be characterized as having constant weighted mean curvature .",
    "[ examples ] the following are @xmath0-hypersurfaces in @xmath13 :    1 .",
    "the hyperplane @xmath14 which is @xmath15 away from the origin .",
    "the cylinder @xmath16 with @xmath17 centered at the origin and + @xmath18 .",
    "the sphere @xmath19 centered at the origin with @xmath20 .",
    "the examples above admit properties such as polynomial volume growth and constant mean curvature .",
    "it is important to investigate under which assumption we can deduce a @xmath0-hypersurface is one of the above . some rigidity results can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that in the special case @xmath21 , equation becomes @xmath22 which is the self - shrinker equation in mean curvature flow .",
    "this comes from the fact that the self - shrinkers are also the critical points of the weighted area functional in gaussian space .",
    "therefore , we call equation the @xmath0-self shrinker equation in this paper . in the study of mean curvature flow ,",
    "solutions of equation are the solitons which move by scaling with respect to the origin .",
    "they are models for singularities in the study of mean curvature flow .    for 1-dimensional self - shrinkers in @xmath23 , abresch and langer@xcite completely characterized the closed solutions .",
    "they prove that circles are the only closed , embedded solutions . for higher dimensional case ,",

    "mller@xcite constructs more closed embedded solutions . for noncompact examples",
    ", the reader can refer to @xcite .",
    "some of the most improtant literature concerning the classification of the self - shrinkers is the following : huisken@xcite classifies the self - shrinkers under the condition of bounded second fundamental form , nonnegative mean curvature and polynomial volume growth . later , colding and minicozzi@xcite remove the requirement of the second fundamental form bound .",
    "this paper focuses on the behavior of the equation in @xmath23 . to simplify the equation",
    ", we scale the curve by a factor of @xmath25 to make the constant @xmath26 become 1 and use the 1-dimensional curvature @xmath27 in place of mean curvature @xmath4 .",
    "the equation becomes @xmath28 we give a sufficient constraint on @xmath0 for embedded solutions to exist .",
    "recall that if a set in @xmath23 is invariant under the rotation of the angle @xmath29 with respect to the origin , we say the set admits @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "[ neglambdanear0 ] for @xmath30 , there exists an embedded solution with 2-symmetry .    [ neglambdanearinfty ] there exist @xmath31 such that for @xmath32 , there exists an embedded solution with @xmath2-symmetry , @xmath33 .",
    "unlike the result of abresch and langer@xcite that for the @xmath21 case , the circle is the only closed embedded solution , we surprisingly find other embedded solutions .",
    "this affects the understanding of the rigidity problem about the classification of @xmath0-hypersurfaces .",
    "if we cross the curve with @xmath14 , we obtain a @xmath0-hypersurface in @xmath6 which is topologically @xmath34 with non - vanishing mean curvature and polynomial area growth . however , this is not the standard round cylinder as in example [ examples ] .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the result with the isoperimetric problem in euclidean space , where the critical surface to the area functional should have constant mean curvature .",
    "thus the only 1-dimensional solutions of the isoperimetric problem in @xmath23 are circles .    for positive @xmath0 ,",
    "the behavior is similar to the self - shrinking curves .",
    "we have    [ poslambda ] when @xmath35 , there is no embedded solutions to the equation with @xmath36 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that guang@xcite establishes the same result as in theorem [ poslambda ] with different proof .",
    "he considers the part of the curve where the curvature decrease from the maximum to the minimum .",
    "this paper will be structured as follows : in section 2 , starting from the defining equation , we derive an ode system for the 1-dimensional @xmath0-self shrinkers .",
    "the approach used here is similar to that in @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the behavior of the solution for the extreme cases : the energy is near the minimum and and energy is near infinity .",
    "we prove the theorem [ neglambdanear0 ] , [ neglambdanearinfty ] and [ poslambda ] . in section 4",
    ", we use matlab to get some curves which approximately solve the equation .",
    "some pictures of the curves are provided for a better understanding of the behavior for each of the different cases in the main theorems .",
    "for a curve @xmath37 parametrized by arc length @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath5 are the tangent vector and the normal vector of the curve , respectively .",
    "note that for any curve in @xmath23 , we have two possible choices of @xmath5 : either rotate @xmath40 clockwise by @xmath41 or @xmath42 . if we let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath46 this tells us that selecting the opposite normal vector will change the sign of @xmath27 and result in a solution corresponding to @xmath47 .    using the method in @xcite , put @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we can obtain the ode system @xmath50 the equilibrium is the point where @xmath51 .",
    "they are given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the positive and the negative solutions of the equation @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "at the equilibrium , the curvature is a nonzero constant .",
    "it corresponds to the circle centered at the origin . for @xmath55 , it is a circle of radius @xmath56 with the normal pointed outward and @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    ", it is a circle of radius @xmath59 with the normal pointed inward and @xmath36 .",
    "also , note that @xmath60 is a solution which corresponds to a line with the minimum distance to the origin equal to @xmath0 . from now on , without loss of generality , we only consider solutions with @xmath61 .",
    "they are the solutions with the trajectory contained in the half plane @xmath62 of @xmath63 space . for the solutions with @xmath57",
    ", choose the opposite normal vector and study them as the solutions corresponding to @xmath47 with positive @xmath27 .",
    "for a solution to the system , the function @xmath64 is positive in the @xmath62 half plane . differentiating it with respect to @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath65 the trajectory of each solution lies in a level set of @xmath66 . since each level set of @xmath66 is a simple closed curve except @xmath67 , which corresponds to the line mentioned before , we have a uniform lower bound away from 0 of the speed of @xmath68 curve on each level set .",
    "therefore , the solution @xmath68 should be periodic in @xmath38 .    note that if @xmath69 is periodic , then @xmath70 , @xmath71 are periodic .",
    "but the converse is not true . starting from a periodic solution of @xmath68 ,",
    "even though we can reconstruct @xmath69 by this and the initial condition , the resulting @xmath69 is periodic only when the change of angle in a period can be expressed as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , @xmath2 are relatively prime positive integers . in this case , the period of @xmath69 is @xmath2 times the period of @xmath68 , and it will be a closed solution .",
    "now , since @xmath27 is more directly related to the geometric behavior than @xmath71 , we use @xmath74 as the variable instead of @xmath75 . from now on , unless otherwise specified , we use @xmath76 for @xmath77 . plugging @xmath78 into the previous ode system ,",
    "it becomes @xmath79 and @xmath62 becomes @xmath80 in @xmath81 plane .",
    "note that after the change of variable , we still have the equilibrium at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 because they satisfy exactly the same equation .",
    "however , @xmath82 correspond to @xmath84 , respectively . the @xmath85 line in @xmath63 space now becomes @xmath86 line in @xmath81 space .    in the @xmath87 half space ,",
    "let @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 multiplying both sides by @xmath91 and integrating with respect to @xmath38 , we get @xmath92 if we define @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the equation becomes @xmath95 the minimum of @xmath96 is attained when @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to the equilibrium at @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "now , for any @xmath102 , we can find the solutions @xmath103 of @xmath104 . considering the differential equation of @xmath105",
    ", we get @xmath106 therefore , the length of the curve in a period is given by @xmath107 and the change of the angle in a period is given by @xmath108 in order to simplify the calculation , let @xmath109 , @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "@xmath111 after the change of variable .",
    "the change of angle , @xmath112 , is given by @xmath113",
    "now , we will focus on the behavior of @xmath112 when the energy @xmath114 varies from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the following focuses on the behavior of @xmath112 .",

    "we have @xmath122    first , note that for the case in which the potential is quadratic , @xmath123 , a simple calculation shows that @xmath124 for any @xmath125 and is independent of @xmath114 .    for arbitrary potential function @xmath117 and @xmath126 , there is @xmath31 such that for all @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 for @xmath129 $ ] . let @xmath130 be the quadratic function which pass through @xmath131 , @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",

    "the derivatives of @xmath140 with respect to @xmath141 at the minimum point are @xmath142 therefore , from the lemma above and recall that @xmath143 , we have @xmath144    from the result of @xcite , since @xmath145 the function @xmath112 is monotone decreasing near @xmath115 with respect to @xmath114 .    for the case of self shrinkers",
