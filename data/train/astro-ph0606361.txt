    "long - lived clumps can form in a massive gravitational unstable protoplanetary disk if the gas is isothermal ( mayer et al .",
    "2002 ) or cools on a timescale comparable to the local orbital time ( rice et al .",
    "2003a , b , mayer et al .",
    "2004a , rice et al .",
    "2005 , mayer et al .",
    "2005 , mejia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "fragmentation under such favourable conditions is a numerically robust result obtained with sph codes as well as grid - based codes with both static and adaptive meshes ( durisen et al . 2005 , mayer et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the main open question is whether the required short cooling times can be obtained in the disks .",
    "shock heating along spiral arms is intense during the phase of strong gravitational instability ( pickett et al . 2000 , 2003 ; mayer et al . 2004b ) and will tend to erase clumps exactly when they have the best chance to collapse .",
    "boss ( 2002a,2002b,2004 ) has used a grid - based code which solves radiation transport with the diffusion approximation .",
    "he found that the disk cools rapidly through convection instead of radiation and forms long lasting clumps .",
    "cai et al .",
    "( 2006 ) adopt flux - limited diffusion in their cylindrical grid code .",
    "they find long cooling times , no evidence of convection and no fragmentation .",
    "their method is very different from that of boss ( 2004 ) . while boss does not use a flux - limiter but embeds the disk in a thermal bath at a constant temperature in the range 40 - 50 k , cai et al add an eddington - like atmosphere on top of the optically thick layer , explicitly matching the fluxes at the boundary .",
    "nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also did not find fragmentation in a 2d sph simulation to which a plane - parallel atmosphere radiating as a blackbody was added assuming that rapid vertical cooling was achieved through convection .",
    "here we present the first 3d sph simulations of protoplanetary disks with flux - limited diffusion .",
    "the disk models are set up as described in mayer et al .",
    "initially disks extend from 4 to 20 au , have a power - law surface density profile and have a minimum temperature of 40 k at the outermost radius .",
    "the simulations employ @xmath3 gas particles with a gravitational softening @xmath4 au , while the central star is represent by a particle with mass @xmath1 and softening @xmath5 au .",
    "disks are grown in mass from a stable state with a high toomre parameter ( tommre 1964 ) , @xmath6 .",
    "mass growth is stopped either when fragmentation begins or when the disk reaches a mass equal to @xmath7 .",
    "thanks to the very high resolution we always fulfill the criterion of bate & burkert ( 1997 ) to avoid spurious fragmentation .",
    "the simulations were run with the parallel sph+n - body code gasoline ( wadsley , stadel & quinn 2004 ) .",
    "we solve the energy equation in asymmetric form accounting for irreversible shock heating via the standard monaghan artificial viscosity term ( we include the balsara correction term to reduce unwanted shear viscosity ) .",
    "the radiation transport is implemented using the diffusion approximation and the flux - limiter of bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . a similar method has been used by whitehouse & bate ( 2006 ) to study the collapse of molecular cloud cores .",
    "the flux limiter appears as a coefficient of a diffusive term in the energy equation . following cleary & monaghan ( 1999 )",
    ", the energy equation reads @xmath8 where the summation is over neighboring particles , @xmath9 is the smoothing kernel , @xmath10 the vector from the position of particle @xmath11 to particle @xmath12 , and @xmath13 takes the form of a thermal conductivity term @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the opacity , @xmath16 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath17 is the flux limiter .",
    "this is a stable method that relaxes the noise of second derivatives .",
    "= 8truecm    to implement the above expression in gasoline , we add the calculation of the temperature gradient to the smoothing operation already in place to calculate the force due to the pressure gradient .",
    "the ( rosseland mean ) opacity of each particle is interpolated from a table of @xmath18 ( dalessio et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the next step is to allow particles on the boundary of the disk to radiate their energy away to infinity . to find particles that are `` on the edge '' of the disk",
    ", we examine the directions to all of the neighbors used in smoothing sums .",
    "if a particle has no neighbors within a certain fraction of a solid angle from a preferred direction ( edge detection angle , hereafter eda ) it is considered an edge particle . from the geometry of a disk , the preferred directions ( treated independently ) are out of the plane of the disk ( both up and down ) and radially outward .",
    "we let edge particles radiate as blackbodies , adding a term to the energy equation of each particle , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the surface through which the particle radiates and @xmath21 is the smoothing length of the particle .",
    "the `` edgeness factor '' @xmath22 represents the fraction of their surface area over which a particle radiates .",
    "it is usually zero , and takes value @xmath23 for particles on one of the up , down , or out boundaries , @xmath24 for those on the edge in both the up and down directions , and @xmath25 for those on the edge in the out and either up or down direction .",
    "the eda used in the check for `` edgeness '' is formally a free parameter .",
    "we only consider angles in the range 30 - 60 degrees ( measured as linear angle in a cone centered on a given particle ) since with these the particles identified as `` edge '' do lie in regions where the optical depth is @xmath26 .",
    "different choices for the eda will effectively yield a different radiative efficiency since both the radiating surface area and the edgeness factor for each particle will change .",
    "the smallest possible size of the radiating surface area is that of the geometric surface area of the disk , which corresponds to an eda of 50 degrees when the disk enters the phase of gravitational instability . within the range of angles",
    "considered the radiative surface area changes by about a factor of 2 .",
    "the term in equation 3 has a timescale that can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the others . to handle this",
    ", we apply a special burlisch - stoer stiff integrator to this term over a single timestep in the outer leapfrog integrator .",
    "we hold the other terms of the energy equation constant over this short integration .",
    "a near solar opacity is used in most of the simulations .",
    "the ( mean ) molecular weight of the gas is by default equal to the solar metallicity value ( @xmath27 ) but is varied between @xmath28 ( pure molecular hydrogen ) and @xmath29 ( highly metal rich ) .",
    "we have run about 15 simulations with varying molecular weight and opacity .",
    "the disk grows uniformly in mass at the rate of @xmath30yr , approaching @xmath31 after about @xmath32 years . when its mass grows above @xmath33 the toomre parameter @xmath34 drops below 2 in the outer part of the disk and strong spiral patterns begin to appear .",
    "the shocks occurring along the spiral arms limit the growth of their amplitude as the increasing pressure counteracts self - gravity . yet",
    ", fragmentation occurs in some of the simulations once the disk mass is in the range @xmath35 ( figure 1 ) . whether the disk fragments or not depends on the details of thermodynamics in the disks , in particular the molecular weight of the gas and the extent of the radiative layer ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we find that a molecular weight equal to @xmath36 or larger is in general necessary for fragmentation to occur ( figure 1 ) .",
    "larger molecular weights effectively soften the pressure gradients across the spiral arms and allow fragmentation to happen for a smaller radiating surface area ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this sensitivity is reminiscent of the sensitivity on the adiabatic index @xmath37 found by mayer et al .",
    "( 2004b ) and rice et al .",
    "( 2005)(here we fix @xmath38 ) .",
    "conversely we varied the disk opacity by a factor of 50 and found almost no difference in the outcome , confirming the results of boss ( 2002a ) . indeed when cooling at the surface is switched off the temperature in the midplane is the same as in a control run performed with an adiabatic equation of state .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the timescale over which thermal energy is transported from the midplane to the surface , which is of order @xmath39 years ( boss 2003 ) , is the product of the radiative diffusion time , which depends on opacity , times the ratio between gas pressure and radiation pressure .",
    "the latter factor is orders of magnitude higher than the radiative diffusion time , is independent of opacity , and is what determines the radiative cooling time of most of the disk .",
    "this confirms earlier findings by pickett et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) on the crucial role of compressional / shock heating in disk instability .    however , the cooling time has to be @xmath40 times shorter , namely of order of the orbital time , for fragmentation to happen ( rice et al .",
    "2003a ; mayer et al .",
    "such short radiative cooling times are only possible at the optically thin edge in our disks .",
    "boss ( 2002b , 2004 ) finds that the disk can cool on such short timescales thanks to convection .",
    "the optical depths in our disks are very large , @xmath41 , near the disk midplane .",
    "convection is expected ( ruden & pollack 1991 ) in such conditions .",
    "the following sequence of events is observed in the simulations and translates into the temperature evolution of overdensities shown in figure 2 ; first , density maxima develop along an optically thick spiral arm in the disk midplane ; second , the gas in the spiral arm is shock heated to temperatures above 150 k ; third , if the disk atmosphere is cold enough while the midplane is shock heated vertical upwellings and downwellings begin which cool the clumps and allow them to become gravitationally bound .",
    "such vertical motions have typical speeds of order  0.1 - 0.4 km / s ( the typical orbital speed at the same radii is @xmath42 km / s ) .",
    "they involve most of the gas particles in a locally overdense region of the disk and occur when the vertical entropy gradient is superadiabatic . these motions where not observed in previous calculations with fixed equations of state in which steep vertical temperature gradients were not produced ( mayer et al .",
    "2004b ) . the pressure scale height",
    ", whose scale should be comparable to the mixing length in the convective motions , is from 10 to 50 times bigger than the sph smoothing length , hence convection should be well resolved .",
    "the measured vertical speeds are high enough to redistribute thermal energy on a timescale of about 30 - 50 years , i.e. from comparable to slightly longer than the orbital time . with such short cooling timescales fragmentation",
    "is expected ( mayer et al . 2004a ; rice et al . 2003a ) .",
    "it is difficult to measure the net transport of energy due to convection because turbulent motions can arise also as a result of shocks ( cai et al .",
    "2006 ) and simultaneously vertical motions are also produced by the accretion flow towards the overdensities at the midplane .",
    "in addition to affecting convection by changing the vertical temperature profile , the radiative efficiency at the cold optically thin layer has a second influence on the final outcome of the disk instability .",
    "the dense regions along the spiral shocks can engulf material from colder regions outside the shock front ( figure 3 ) , and this accretion flow is stronger for colder material .",
    "these regions are optically thin down to a vertical scale height half of that of the neighboring overdense spiral arms and are naturally produced as the arms unwind .",
    "they provide a reservoir of cold gas that overdensities can accrete , promoting their growth .",
    "this is an example of the complex coupling between the dynamics and thermodynamics seen in these simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that the typical midplane temperatures ( @xmath43k ) and midplane surface densities ( @xmath44 g/@xmath45 ) of our disks where clumps first appear ( at about @xmath46 au ) are admitted as fragmenting solutions by the analytical model of rafikov ( 2005 ) , given a toomre parameter @xmath47 and a cooling time @xmath48 as the criteria for fragmentation ( see mayer et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "once formed , gravitationally bound clumps have masses that range range from one to a few jupiter masses , are differentially rotating and have densities a million times higher than the background density .",
    "they reach @xmath49 at the scale of the softening and temperatures @xmath50 k. in general they resemble clumps formed in simulations with an adiabatic equation of state above a fixed density threshold ( mayer et al . 2004a , b ) .",
    "we have shown that disks can fragment even when radiative transfer is included .",
    "however , fragmentation requires a disk somewhat more massive than in previous works relying on simple equations of states or parameterizations of the cooling time .",
    ", @xmath51 as opposed to @xmath52 ( mayer et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "it is strongly dependent on the efficiency of cooling at the optically thin boundary and on the molecular weight .",
    "the newly discovered dependence on molecular weight is intriguing since it establishes for the first time a direct link between the disk instability mechanism and the metallicity of the gas .",
    "such a link is straightforward in the competing model , core - accretion ( pollack et al .",
    "hence the formation of giant planets by disk instability should be favoured around more metal rich stars , in line with the observed correlation ( fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "a more metal rich disk will also have a higher cooling rate in the optically thin region ( cai et al .",
    "2006 ) , which also appears to promote gravitational instability , whilst the associated increase of opacity in the optically thick regions will not affect the outcome based on our results .    the radiation physics in the simulations presented here is still simplified .",
    "in particular , the disk edge could be heated as a result of irradiation from the central star and/or neighboring bright stars , erasing the steep temperature gradient necessary to drive convection . on the other end , when an overdensity forms dust might accumulate at its location owing to the action of gas drag ( haghighipour & boss , .",
    "2003 , durisen et al . 2005 ) , thus increasing locally the molecular weight and enhancing the chances of fragmentation . in the latter case",
    "the clumps would be automatically enriched in heavy elements relative to the surrounding disk , as seen in the gas giants of the solar system ( saumon & guillot 2004 ) and predicted by recent models of core accretion ( alibert et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there are situations in which fragmentation may be achieved more easily than suggested here .",
    "indeed a new set of simulations being completed as we write indicates that if the mass of the central star is lowered to @xmath53 , the disk fragments for masses @xmath54 for a molecular weight as small as @xmath55 . in this case",
    "a lower shear allows a higher pressure front to be tolerated from growing overdensities .",
    "therefore with disk instability formation of giant planets around m dwarfs is likely ( see also boss 2006 ) .",
    "we also find that if the disk does not grow slowly in mass but starts with @xmath56 , as it might happen in response to a sudden external perturbation , fragmentation occurs with @xmath57 and edge detection angles of up to 60 degrees . on the other end",
    ", previous work shows that long lasting , time - dependent perturbations such as those induced by the presence of a binary companion might quench the fragmentation by increasing the heating due to spiral shocks ( mayer et al . 2005 ) .    in summary",
    ", it seems that an ultimate answer requires that all the details of the radiation physics in the disks and in their surrounding environment are taken into account together with the details of the disk formation process .",
