    "the emergence of collective motion in active systems composed of ( self-)propelled entities is a highly complex self - organization phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "examples include systems on vastly different length scales , ranging from micrometer - sized systems , made of biological constituents  @xcite , over millimeter - sized vibrating hard granules  @xcite , to large cooperative animal groups  @xcite .",
    "while all these systems share the capacity to form collective patterns , the precise mechanisms how they are formed and their degree of universality remain elusive .    historically , generic agent - based models  @xcite constitute the first theoretical approach aiming to understand the minimal ingredients necessary for the emergence of collective motion . in the vicsek model",
    "@xcite collective motion is thought to be a consequence of a generic competition between a local tendency of  ferromagnetic parallel alignment \" and noise . specifically , particle alignment is implemented as an update rule in the spirit of a cellular automaton : each particle aligns parallel to the average of all particles orientations within some defined finite neighborhood .",
    "vicsek - like models have been instrumental in exploring the pattern forming capabilities of active systems  @xcite . nevertheless , there are also drawbacks of such generic agent - based models .",
    "most importantly , they do not account for the physics of the interaction between active constituent particles .",
    "in the meantime there have emerged however a range of well characterized experimental model systems including actin and microtubule gliding assays  @xcite , and shaken granular particles  @xcite , which are amenable to a highly quantitative analysis at the scale of collisions between individual particles .",
    "these microscopic features can , in principle , be analyzed in terms of molecular dynamics simulations : while in cellular automata like the vicsek model particles move at constant speed , newtonian dynamics explicitly account for driving forces and dissipation .",
    "moreover , instead of update rules there are interaction forces between the constituent particles .",
    "the ensuing equations of motion allow for a more realistic description of individual particle trajectories as well as resolving the time and length scales of pairwise collisions .",
    "although previous studies of such models show an even richer spatio - temporal dynamics than vicsek - like models  @xcite , a thorough analysis of how order builds up from microscopic particle interactions has never been undertaken .",
    "here we try to close this gap and ask , focusing on dilute conditions : can we understand the collective dynamics of active particle systems by solely considering _ binary _ interactions between the constituents ?",
    "we address this question by a combination of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and kinetic theory .",
    "specifically , we consider a system of active spherical particles interacting by a short - ranged and repulsive harmonic force . in the absence of interactions , these soft particles move at constant speed determined by a balance between a driving and a dissipative force . from md simulations for this system of",
    "_ soft active colloids _ we determine the phase boundary between the isotropic and the polarized state . to connect these numerical studies with a kinetic approach",
    ", we employ the md simulations to also analyze binary scattering of particles .",
    "thereby one can extract the underlying collision - rule , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mapping of the pre - collisional to the post - collisional velocities , which lends itself as a starting point to set up a boltzmann equation for the one - particle distribution function . following previous approaches in the literature @xcite , the latter can also be used to determine the phase boundary . any mismatch between this phase boundary and the one obtained from the md simulations",
    "must be directly related to the assumptions underlying the boltzmann equation . since these assumptions concern the nature of the particle collisions and the ensuing correlations between the positions and orientations of the particles , a quantification of the mismatch will allow a deepened understanding of the ordering process in active systems and highlight the differences to thermodynamic systems . in particular , it will be interesting to see to what degree the molecular chaos assumption of classical boltzmann s theory remains valid for active systems .",

    "<S> collective motion in actively propelled particle systems is triggered on the very local scale by nucleation of coherently moving units consisting of just a handful of particles . </S>",
    "<S> these units grow and merge over time , ending up in a long - range ordered , coherently - moving state . </S>",
    "<S> so far , there exists no bottom - up understanding of how the microscopic dynamics and interactions between the constituents are related to the system s ordering instability . in this paper , we study a class of models for propelled colloids allowing an explicit treatment of the microscopic details of the collision process . specifically , the model equations are newtonian equations of motion with separate force terms for particles driving , dissipation and interaction forces . focusing on dilute particle systems , we analyze the binary scattering behavior for these models , and determine  based on the microscopic dynamics  the corresponding  collision - rule \" , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the mapping of pre - collisional velocities and impact parameter on post - collisional velocities . by studying binary scattering we also find that the considered models for active colloids share the same principle for parallel alignment : the first incoming particle ( with respect to the center of collision ) is aligned to the second particle as a result of the encounter . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is distinctively different to alignment in non - driven dissipative gases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the obtained collision rule lends itself as a starting point to apply kinetic theory for propelled particle systems in order to determine the phase boundary to a long - range ordered , coherently - moving state . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of the collision rule offers the opportunity to quantitatively scrutinize the predictions of kinetic theory for propelled particle systems through direct comparison with multi - particle simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we identify local _ precursor _ correlations at the onset of collective motion to constitute the essential determinant for a qualitative and quantitative validity of kinetic theory . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our  renormalized \" approach clearly indicates that the framework of kinetic theory is flexible enough to accommodate the complex behavior of soft active colloids and allows a bottom - up understanding of how the microscopic dynamics of binary collisions relates to the system s behavior on large length and time - scales . </S>"
