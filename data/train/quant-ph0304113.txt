    "celebrated results of shor  @xcite and grover  @xcite started a quest for algorithms based on quantum mechanics which can surpass corresponding classical algorithms .",
    "as many classical algorithms employ properties of random walks on graphs , several groups of researchers have begun to study properties of quantum analogues of classical random walks ( for a survey see  @xcite ) .",
    "two models of quantum random walks have been proposed by aharonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and farhi and gutmann  @xcite ; in the paper we consider only a discrete quantum walk as defined in  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of quantum random walks have been shown to differ greatly from their classical counterparts .",
    "ambainis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that the spreading time in the quantum walk on line scales linearly with the number of steps , while aharonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the mixing time for a walk on a cycle grows linearly with the cycle length . even more spectacular exponential speed up",
    "was discovered by kempe _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who studied a quantum random walk on hypercube ; this result led to the construction of the first quantum algorithm based on a random walk by shenvi _",
    "et al . _",
    "the fact that in quantum walks on graphs the probability function spreads out much faster than in classical case is not the only factor which can be explored in designing new quantum algorithms . in  @xcite",
    "the authors remarked that ` one may try to use quantum walks which converge to limiting distribution which are different than those of the corresponding classical walks ' . in this note",
    "we follow this suggestion and study the limiting distribution of a random walk on a cycle ; it turns out that it depends on the length of the cycle in a somewhat surprising way .",
    "we also give an example of a quantum walk in which the distance from the initial state to the uniform distribution is larger than the distance between the uniform distribution and the initial state .",
    "finally , we remark that recently travaglione and milburn  @xcite and dr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a scheme of experiment which realizes a quantum walk on a cycle .",
    "we study a quantum random walk on a cycle with @xmath0 nodes . in the model of such a walk proposed in  @xcite nodes",
    "are represented by vectors @xmath1 , @xmath2 , which form an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "an auxiliary two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 ( coin space ) is spanned by vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 . the initial state of the walk is a normalized vector @xmath7 . in a single step of the walk the state changes according to the equation",
    "@xmath8 first applies the hadamard gate operator @xmath9 to the vector from @xmath4 , and then shifts the state by the operator @xmath10    the probability distribution on the nodes of the cycle after the first @xmath11 steps of the walk is given by @xmath12 however , as was observed by aharonov _ at el . _",
    "@xcite , for a fixed @xmath13 , the probability @xmath14 is ` quasi - periodic ' as a function of @xmath11 and thus , typically , it does not converge to a limit .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath14 the authors of  @xcite considered @xmath15 and proved that for any initial state @xmath16 and every node @xmath2 , the sequence @xmath17 converges to the limiting distribution @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , @xmath21 stand for the eigenvectors of @xmath20 , and @xmath22    in the case of the hadamard walk on cycle , for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we get @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 note that @xmath28 so @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the kronecker delta .",
    "thus , ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , then all eigenvalues are distinct , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ; consequently , @xmath35 .",
    "it comes as no surprise , since as was proved in aharonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the limiting distribution @xmath36 is always uniform in a non - degenerate case .",
    "thus we concentrate on more interesting case of even @xmath0 .",
    "then , because of symmetries @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the coefficient @xmath39 does not vanish when one of the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , for @xmath45 ;    where here and below @xmath48 .",
    "we study in detail the limiting distribution @xmath36 for a quantum walk for which starts with a state in which with probability one a particle is at a node @xmath49 ; more specifically we set @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 . since @xmath54 except of the four cases ( i)(iv ) described above ,",
    "we get @xmath55 where by @xmath56 denotes the distance between nodes @xmath49 and @xmath13 , and @xmath57 after some elementary but not very exciting calculations ( [ e16 ] ) reduces to @xmath58 we remark that @xmath59 whenever @xmath60 , i.e. , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . hence the limiting distribution for even cycles of sizes two and four",
    "are uniform , which has also been observed by travaglione and milburn  @xcite , who analyzed a quantum walk on cycle of length four step by step .",
    "however , for @xmath63 we have @xmath64 with the ` correction ' term @xmath65 , where @xmath66 setting @xmath67 , one can write ( [ e21 ] ) as @xmath68 which , in turn , transforms to @xmath69 where @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 when @xmath72 is even , and @xmath73 if @xmath72 is odd . thus , we arrive at @xmath74     the limiting distributions for the cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the walk starts with the state where with probability one a particle is at the node @xmath77 . ]    in figure  [ f1 ] we pictured the resulting limiting distributions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to see they are almost uniform except for the nodes which lie next to the initially populated node @xmath49 and the opposite node @xmath78 . indeed , as @xmath79 , the last term of ( [ e24 ] ) vanishes and @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the distance between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath83 .",
    "the equation  ( [ e24b ] ) shows that the correction term @xmath84 is significant only for @xmath13 which lie close to either @xmath49 or @xmath83 and decreases exponentially with the distance between @xmath13 and @xmath49 and @xmath83 .",
    "note that the shapes of the cusps near @xmath49 and @xmath85 does not depend very much on @xmath0 for large @xmath0 ( except of the scaling factor @xmath86 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath72 is odd then the limiting distribution @xmath87 has a minimum at @xmath83 , while if @xmath72 is even the distribution has a peak @xmath83 , virtually identical with that which appear at @xmath49 ( see figures  [ f1 ] and [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the fact that such a local behaviour of the limiting distribution @xmath36 depends so strongly on ` global ' properties of space , as the parity of @xmath72 , is somewhat surprising .",
    "we hope that this and/or analogous phenomena can be used in constructing efficient quantum algorithms .     the limiting distribution for cycles of lengths @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in each case the walk starts with a state in which with probability one a particle is at @xmath91.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is easy to see that , despite of a narrow cusps near nodes @xmath49 and @xmath83 , the total variation distance @xmath92 between the limiting distribution given by  ( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ e24 ] ) and the uniform distribution tends to 0 as @xmath79 .",
    "however it is not hard as well to construct ` highly non - uniform ' distributions which remain invariant during the walk : one can simply take as the initial state a superposition of two degenerated eigenvectors ( the distribution corresponding to a single eigenvector is always a uniform one ) .",
    "an example of such an invariant nonuniform probability distribution is presented on figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "an example of a non - uniform invariant probability distribution for an initial state of the form @xmath93 . ]    with a slightly more work one can construct the initial states which indicate differences between quantum and classical walks on cycles even more distinctively .",
    "one such example is shown on figure  [ f5 ] . here",
    "the total variation distance from the uniform distribution , defined as @xmath94 is equal @xmath95 for the initial state , while for the limiting distribution it grows to @xmath96 .",
    "0.5truecm     the initial and limiting distributions for the initial state @xmath97 .",
    "we study the properties of a hadamard quantum walk on a cycle with @xmath0 nodes . in the case of a walk starting from a single node we give an explicit formula for the limiting distribution and show that it is very sensitive to the arithmetic properties @xmath0 .",
    "we hope that this or an analogous mode of behaviour can be used in construction of efficient quantum algorithms .    furthermore , we present an example of a quantum walk on a cycle , for which the total variation distance between the initial distribution and the uniform distribution is much smaller than the distance between limiting distribution and the uniform one ."
