    "forty years ago andrew casson taught us @xcite that singularities of surfaces and the fundamental group of their complements are intimately related .",

    "what direction they point is presently unknown .",
    "they might later be seen as : a step in proving the full surgery conjecture , or contrariwise as pointing toward a surgery obstruction , or possibly as mere curiosities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain these surprises and reconsider fundamental conjectures and constructions in this new light .",
    "topological surgery is known to work in dimension @xmath1 for a class of `` good '' fundamental groups .",
    "originally this was established in the simply - connected setting by the first author in @xcite .",
    "it has since been shown @xcite that elementary amenable groups , and more recently @xcite the groups of subexponential growth are good in this sense .",
    "the validity of surgery for arbitrary fundamental groups remains a central open problem .",
    "surgery may be reduced to a collection of _ universal _ problems @xcite with free fundamental groups , therefore the validity of surgery for ( non - abelian ) free groups is the key open question .",
    "it has been reformulated @xcite in terms of the _ a - b slice _",
    "problem for a family of links , the `` generalized borromean rings '' .",
    "we give applications of the group - theoretic _",
    "@xmath0-engel relation _ both to the a - b slice problem and to construction of model surgery problems .",
    "the study of the universal relation , stating that all @xmath3-fold commutators of the form @xmath4,x]]$ ] are trivial in a group @xmath5 , dates back to the work of burnside @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen to be equivalent to the relation that every element @xmath6 in @xmath5 commutes with all of its conjugates @xmath7 .",
    "a restricted version of this relation is familiar in low - dimensional topology : when applied to a set of preferred normal generators @xmath6 of a group @xmath5 , it is a defining relation of the _ milnor group _ @xmath8 , see @xcite and section [ engel section ] below .",
    "the results of imposing the relation in these two settings turn out to be quite different : the free milnor group on @xmath2 generators , @xmath9 , is nilpotent of class @xmath2 . on the other hand , the free group @xmath10 modulo the universal @xmath0-engel relation is nilpotent of class @xmath3 , independent of @xmath2 ( see section [ engel section ] ) .",

    "given an @xmath2-component gbr @xmath12 , the existence of the free group action is then equivalent to the existence of @xmath2 decompositions @xmath16 and a disjoint embedding problem for these @xmath17 submanifolds into @xmath18 , with the boundary condition given by the link @xmath12 and its parallel copy . if this embedding problem has a solution , the link @xmath12 is called a - b slice .    considering handle decompositions of the submanifolds ,",
    "one gets a pair of links , which we call a `` stabilization '' , corresponding to the @xmath19- and @xmath0-handles . the embedding question",
    "can then be reformulated @xcite as a _ relative - slice problem _ for a certain collection of link pairs corresponding to a gbr @xmath12 .",
    "a key feature of the gbr s is that they are homotopically essential in the sense of milnor .",
    "therefore it is a natural question whether there is a link - homotopy obstruction in the a - b slice problem , in other words whether the relevant relative - slice problems do not even admit a link - homotopy solution .",
    "the evidence thus far has pointed to an affirmative answer : partial obstructions of this type have been found for many families of decompositions , see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , here we construct first examples of decompositions giving rise to a homotopy solution to the a - b slice problem .",
    "[ abslice theorem ] _ the generalized borromean rings , a collection of links forming model surgery problems , are homotopy a - b slice .",

    "the theorem is true for both notions .",
    "the action of the free group on @xmath18 by covering transformations is encoded in the requirement that the disjoint embeddings of the @xmath20 in @xmath18 are _ standard _ , in other words isotopic to the original embeddings corresponding to the given decompositions @xmath16 .",

    "one way to view theorem [ abslice theorem ] is as evidence towards the validity of the surgery conjecture .",
    "there is a well established hierarchy of @xmath0-complexes , defined in terms of gropes and capped gropes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , extrapolating between disjoint disks with self - intersections and actual embedded disks .",
    "it seems possible that a homotopy solution to the ab slice problem may be further improved using group - theoretic methods .",
    "for example @xmath2-engel relations , @xmath21 , are candidates for such an approach , however these higher relations are not as well understood .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a recent survey of the subject .",
    "it is an open question whether a homotopy solution may be improved to a stage that would imply an actual embedded solution to the ab slice problem . to assist the reader who would like to solve this problem we discuss in the appendix how @xmath2-engel relations relate to higher order self - intersections of a disk .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that whitehead doubles of ( homotopically trivial)@xmath22 links ( a class of links just slightly smaller than homotopically trivial links ) are topologically slice .",
    "therefore ( a suitably formulated version of ) the ab slice problem has a solution for ( homotopically trivial)@xmath22 links .",
    "viewing our present work in the context of the relative - slice problem , discussed in section [ abslice section ] , for each gbr we find a stabilization so that the resulting link is homotopically trivial . as remarked above ,",
    "starting with a ( homotopically trivial)@xmath22 link a stabilization may be found so that the result is slice .",
    "there is gap corresponding to the @xmath23 assumption , but it is an interesting question whether the two stabilizations may be combined to give a solution .",
    "overall , the key open problem is to determine whether there still is an obstruction to the ab slice problem in terms of nilpotent invariants of links , specifically milnor s @xmath24-invariants ( with repeating coefficients ) .",
    "of course such an obstruciton would give a counterexample to surgery for free groups .",
    "conversely , as discussed above the ability to `` improve '' a homotopy solution could lead to the resolution of the surgery conjecture in the affirmative .",
    "an axiomatic framework in terms of _ topological arbiters _ for an obstruction in the ab slice program has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "since our theorem [ abslice theorem ] constructs a solution up to homotopy , there is no topological arbiter satisfying an extended `` bing doubling axiom '' @xcite defined in terms of @xmath25-invariants with non - repeating coefficients .",
    "since the method of proof of theorem [ abslice theorem ] does not extend to the relevant stabilized link together with parallel copies of its components , @xmath24-invariants with repeating coefficients remain a candidate for a surgery obstruction .",

    "a recent paper @xcite gave a thorough analysis of the decompositions of the @xmath1-ball where @xmath27 has two @xmath0-handles and _ one _ @xmath19-handle .",

    "( the @xmath28-side has a handle decomposition with the number of @xmath19- and @xmath0-handles reversed . )",
    "it seems likely that a novel algebraic structure will be needed to gain further insight into the problem .    in section [ s - cobordism section ]",
    "we describe a slicing problem for a link in a @xmath1-manifold ( the `` round handle problem '' ) where the existence of a solution depends not just on surgery but also on the @xmath29-dimensional s - cobordism conjecture . at first sight",
    "this problem appears similar to the relative - slice formulation of the ab slice problem for gbr s , however the proof of theorem [ abslice theorem ] does not extend to this setting .",
    "this suggests a subtle distinction between the two problems , with the possibility that a link - homotopy obstruction is still possible to the combination of surgery and s - cobordism conjectures .",
