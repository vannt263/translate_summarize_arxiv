    "after its proposal by marzari and vanderbilt@xcite , the maximally - localized wannier function approach@xcite has been widely used as a convenient tool to construct localized orthonormal functions in crystals .",
    "these wannier functions are obtained from unitary transformation of the bloch functions , whose phase factors are chosen so that the spatial spreads of the wannier functions@xcite are minimized .",
    "the maximally - localized wannier functions have been employed for a number of applications , such as analysis of chemical bonding and basis functions for linear - scaling calculations or model hamiltonians in strongly - correlated systems@xcite .    as found by souza _ _ et al.__@xcite in the case of the @xmath0-like wannier function of cu , the wannier functions obtained in the maximal - localization procedure do not necessarily reflect the spatial symmetry of the system ; the center of the 4@xmath0-like wannier function of cu is not at the cu atom but at the tetrahedral interstitial site .",
    "a similar result was reported by thygesen _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "this feature of the maximal - localization approach has some drawbacks ; the center of the maximally - localized wannier functions is not necessarily on atom positions or other high - symmetry points , which sometimes makes the interpretation of the obtained wannier functions difficult .",
    "furthermore , due to the lack of definite symmetry in the wannier functions , one has to calculate the transformation matrix from the bloch functions to the wannier functions for all @xmath1-points in the first brillouin zone , not only inside the irreducible part of it .",
    "the connection between the symmetry of the crystal and the properties of wannier functions was first discussed by des cloizeaux@xcite from the view point of group theory .",
    "his basic idea is that the wannier functions can be chosen to be the basis of the irreducible representations of a subgroup of the full symmetry group of the system whose elements do not change the given point in the unit cell , and he derived the relation between these wannier functions and the eigenfunctions of the one - particle hamiltonian of the crystal(i.e .",
    "bloch states ) .",
    "this idea is based on the site - symmetry group and the theory of the induced representations@xcite , and there have been a number of works considering these symmetry - adapted wannier functions@xcite . based on this idea ,",
    "in this work we propose a procedure to construct symmetry - adapted wannier functions in the framework of the maximally - localized wannier function approach . considering the symmetry properties of the specified set of the wannier functions and the bloch functions used",
    ", we derive a formula that the transformation matrix follows , and perform the minimization of the spread functional with this symmetry constraint .",
    "our procedure enables one to control the symmetry and center of the wannier functions , and it also enables one to generate the transformation matrix for a general @xmath1-point from its symmetry - equivalent point inside the irreducible brillouin zone(ibz ) , which simplifies the minimization of the spread functional . as a test of our approach , we consider wannier functions of gaas and cu .",
    "in this section we summarize the main points of site symmetry group and symmetry - adapted wannier functions following ref .  .",
    "we refer to refs .   for details of the theory .",
    "the starting point of this idea is to specify a set of positions in real space(``sites '' ) in which one or more wannier functions will be centered .",
    "these sites can be either atomic positions , at chemical bonds , or interstitial sites , depending on the case of interest .",
    "the site symmetry group of a given point @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath3 , is a subgroup of the full symmetry group of the crystal @xmath4 whose elements leave @xmath2 unchanged : namely , @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the rotation and the translation part of the symmetry operation with @xmath8 a lattice translation vector .",

    "from the site symmetry group for a given point @xmath2 , the symmetry - adapted wannier functions centered at @xmath2 are defined as the basis functions of the irreducible representations of the site symmetry group @xmath3 ; these wannier functions are represented as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 labels the irreducible representations and @xmath25 runs over the basis functions of the irreducible representation @xmath24 , and @xmath26 is the dimension of the irreducible representation @xmath24 . for @xmath27",
