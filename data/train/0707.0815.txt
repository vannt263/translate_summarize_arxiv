    "jet - like azimuthal correlations have shown significant modifications in central au+au collisions at rhic due to the presence of the hot and dense medium created in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a strong evidence of jet quenching where high energy partons lose energy through interactions with the medium .",
    "the inferred medium energy density is sufficiently high that formation of the quark - gluon plasma is plausible  @xcite .",
    "most jet - like correlation measurements performed so far are at mid - rapidity where gluon - jets dominate at rhic energies  @xcite",
    ". measurements of mid - rapidity jet - like correlation with forward high-@xmath0 hadrons have been performed for @xmath6 and d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "star also has the capability to carry out correlation measurements at forward rapidities using the forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs ) , which cover the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath1 , with mid - rapidity trigger particles from the main tpc .",
    "these correlations should be dominated by quark jets , as discussed below .",
    "this paper presents such measurements .",
    "they potentially address two problems as follow .",
    "mid - rapidity jet - correlation measurements have revealed a number of novel phenomena : ( i ) the away - side jet - like correlation is significantly broadened in central au+au collisions . for some kinematic regions ,",
    "the away - side correlation may even peak away from @xmath8 ( opposite direction to the trigger particle in azimuth )  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) recent 3-particle azimuthal correlation results from star reveal structures consistent with conical emission  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the near - side jet - like correlation at mid - rapidity is observed to have a long range @xmath9 correlation , rather flat within the measured range of @xmath10 ( the so - called ridge )  @xcite .",
    "will these phenomena also be present at forward rapidities ?",
    "how far does the ridge extend in pseudo - rapidity ?",
    "these questions may be addressed by jet - like correlation measurements at forward rapidities .",
    "gluon energy loss in nuclear medium is predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to be stronger than quark s by a factor of 9/4  @xcite . to test the qcd energy loss picture",
    ", it is valuable to also have measurements where quark jets dominate , which can be obtained from measurements at forward rapidities .",
    "if quarks indeed lose less energy than gluons , one would expect that jet - like correlations at forward rapidities are less modified than at mid - rapidity , where gluon fragmentation dominates .",
    "however , the pathlengths through the medium may also be different for jets at forward and mid - rapidity .",
    "detailed calculations incorporating realistic medium denisties and expansion dynamics are likely needed to disentangle these effects .",
    "the mid - rapidity di - jet correlations measured at rhic stem primarily from hard scatterings of partons of small bjorken @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "they are dominated by gluons because at small @xmath11 gluons far outnumber quarks  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a di - jet with one at mid - rapidity and the other at forward rapidity comes from parton scattering of quite different kinematics .",
    "while the mid - rapidity jet is still dominated by small-@xmath11 gluons , the forward jet has to come from a large-@xmath11 parton in order to be at forward rapidity with balancing @xmath0 . at large @xmath11 ,",
    "valence quarks dominate  @xcite .",
    "thus , a mid- and forward - rapidity di - jet primarily comes from hard - scattering between a small-@xmath11 gluon and a large-@xmath11 quark . for mid - rapidity trigger particle",
    "@xmath5  gev/@xmath3 reported here , the initial gluon energy is of the order of 5  gev , or @xmath12 ; that for the quark is of the order @xmath13 , based on leading order estimate .",
    "the asymmetric parton scattering kinematics , coupled with the asymmetric d+au collisions , provide an opportunity to probe the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "if the relative number of small-@xmath11 gluons to large-@xmath11 quarks in au - nucleus equals to that in deuteron , there will be equal numbers of g(d)+q(au ) and g(au)+q(d ) scatterings .",
    "normalized by the total number of trigger particles ( gluon - jets ) , the jet - like correlation strengths at the d - side and the au - side will be the same and add up to the correlation strength of per - quark  fragmentation \" .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number of gluons is reduced relative to that of quarks in au - nucleus , then there will be fewer g(au)+q(d ) than g(d)+q(au ) scatterings . as a result",
    ", the d - side correlation strength will be reduced relative to that at the au - side .",
    "such a reduction would be a signature of cgc .",
    "the two main detectors used in this analysis are the star s main tpc  @xcite and the ftpcs  @xcite .",
    "the analysis selects high-@xmath0 trigger particles , @xmath14  gev/@xmath3 , from the main tpc within @xmath15 , and correlates them with charged particles measured in the ftpcs within @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 cut for the associated particles is @xmath16  gev/@xmath3 , where the upper cut is dictated by the relatively poor momentum resolution of the ftpcs .",
    "this also prevents us from selecting high-@xmath0 trigger particles from the ftpcs .",
    "the combinatorial background is obtained from event - mixing .",
    "the elliptic flow modulation for au+au collisions , @xmath17 , is added in pairwise during event - mixing .",
    "the trigger particle elliptic flow @xmath18 is taken to be the average from the modified reaction plane and the 4-particle cumulant methods , and the range of the two is used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty , as in  @xcite .",
    "the associated particle @xmath19 is measured for 20 - 70% au+au collisions in the ftpcs by several methods  @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the two - particle cumulant @xmath20 is used and parameterized as @xmath21 ) \\times 2.29\\,\\exp[-(\\eta/2.51)^2/2]$ ] .",
    "the centrality dependence of the ftpc @xmath19 is parameterized using preliminary star results .",
    "the ftpc @xmath22 results obtained from different methods are in good agreement  @xcite . however , as a conservative estimate the same relative systematic uncertainty as at mid - rapidity is applied on the ftpc @xmath19 .",
    "the results reported here have been corrected for tracking efficiency and acceptance of associated particles , and normalized per trigger particle . besides @xmath19 ,",
    "the other major source of systematic uncertainty comes from background normalization which is described in section  [ results ] .",
    "an additional overall systematic uncertainty of 10% is estimated due to efficiency and acceptance corrections .",
    "we first present and compare the forward - rapidity jet - like correlation results from @xmath6 and d+au collisions at @xmath7  gev . the d+au results",
    "potentially probe the cgc .",
    "we then compare these results to au+au collisions at @xmath7  gev .",
    "the question to address by this comparison is whether or not the energy loss and the jet quenching picture differ between mid- and forward rapidities .",
    "the results have been presented previously by star  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppdau ] shows the azimuthal correlations in minimum bias @xmath6 and d+au collisions .",
    "the positive ( d - side ) and negative ( au - side ) pseudo - rapidity results are presented separately for d+au collisions ; the two @xmath23 regions are averaged for @xmath6 .",
    "the combinatorial background is normalized to the signal in the near - side region of @xmath24 where no correlation signals are expected .",
    "( the near - side correlation is contained in the vicinity of the trigger particle which is restricted at mid - rapidity in the main tpc . )",
    "while the correlation shapes are the same , the correlation strength at the d - side is about a factor of 2 smaller than that at the au - side .",
    "the @xmath6 data is approximately equal to the average of the d- and au - side correlation strengths .",
    "this is expected as the sum of the correlation strengths , to first order , should be equal to that from a single quark fragmentation as discussed above .",
    "our measured reduction in the d - side correlation strength is in qualitative agreement with the observed high-@xmath0 suppression in particle production at forward rapidity by brahms  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that parton distributions in bound nucleons are different from the ones in free nucleons , so some reduction in the correlation strength at the d - side may be expected if the small-@xmath11 gluons in au are suppressed due to shadowing .",
    "however , gluons at @xmath25 are in the anti - shadowing region according to eks98  @xcite  they are more abundant in heavy nuclei than in free nucleons by about 15% , rather scale - independent .",
    "moreover , the quark distribution at large @xmath11 is suppressed in nuclei , the so - called emc effect  @xcite ; the suppression is maximal ( about 20% ) at @xmath26 .",
    "both the gluon anti - shadowing and the emc effect should make the relative number of small-@xmath11 gluons to large-@xmath11 quarks larger in heavy nuclei than in free nucleons , the opposite of the observed reduction of the d - side correlation strength .",
    "cgc calculcations , on the other hand , predict a suppression of the gluon density in nuclei at small-@xmath11  @xcite . the observed reduction of the d - side correlation strength is in qualitative agreement with such a suppression , and is also in line with the mid - rapidity correlation measurement with a forward @xmath27 by star  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the forward quark from the deuteron may suffer energy degradation ( nucleon rapidity shift ) traversing the au - nucleus thickness before striking a gluon from the au - nucleus",
    ". this could also reduce the d - side jet - like correlation strength , whose magnitude , however , needs theoretical investigation .",
    "figure  [ fig : auaumb ] shows the azimuthal correlation results in minimum bias au+au collisions ( about 80% of the total geometrical cross - section ) .",
    "the raw correlation is shown in the left panel together with the combinatorial background .",
    "the background - subtracted result is shown in the right panel .",
    "the background is normalized to the signal within the normalization range of @xmath28 by the zero yield at 1 ( zya1 ) method  @xcite , where the minimum correlation signal is found .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the background normalization is estimated by varying the size of the normalization range around @xmath29 .",
    "we do not normalize the background to the entire near - side region as for @xmath6 and d+au because the near - side correlation in au+au may not be zero _ a priori _ ; the @xmath9 ridge observed at mid - rapidity  @xcite could extend to forward rapidities .",
    "as seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : auaumb ] , the near - side correlation for @xmath16  gev/@xmath3 in minimum bias data is consistent with zero within the systematic uncertainties .",
    "[ fig : auau ]    figure  [ fig : auau ] shows the azimuthal correlations for 60 - 80% and 20 - 40% ( left panel ) and for 0 - 10% ( right panel ) au+au collisions .",
    "results for two associated @xmath0 ranges are shown for the 0 - 10% au+au data .",
    "the near - side correlations for @xmath16  gev/@xmath3 are consistent with zero within the systematic uncertainties . however",
    ", the central data at high associated @xmath0 , with the reduced systematic uncertainty , are suggestive of non - zero correlation on the near - side .",
    "this result indicates that long range @xmath9 correlations , first observed in @xmath10  @xcite , may extend out to @xmath30 in the ftpcs .",
    "the away - side correlation shapes in au+au collisions are significantly broadened relative to @xmath6 and d+au collisions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : auau ] .",
    "the broadening is present for each centrality and is similar to mid - rapidity measurements . given the present systematic uncertainties , the away - side correlation is consistent with either a flat or a double - peaked distribution .",
    "however , the observed broadness of the away - side correlation is robust and suggests that the medium modification to jet - like correlations is as strong at forward rapidity as at mid - rapidity .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] compares the shapes of the azimuthal correlations at mid- and forward rapidities .",
    "the near - side correlations are different because the near - side correlation centers around the trigger particle which is at mid - rapidity in the main tpc and should be naively absent from forward rapidities ( except for possibly the ridge ) .",
    "the away - side correlations are remarkably similar between mid- and forward rapidities .",
    "one should note that the individual correlation functions have large systematic uncertainties , but these uncertainties ( mainly due to flow ) are strongly correlated .",
    "therefore , while the particular shape is subject to a large uncertainty , the comparison between the shapes is rather robust .",
    "the broadening and flattening of the away - side shape indicates that partons at forward rapidity suffer strong interactions with the medium .",
    "the similarity of the away - side shapes at mid- and forward rapidity is rather striking , given the different multiplicity ( medium density ) and geometry ( path length ) .",
    "this could imply a number of scenarios : ( 1 ) the energy loss is so large that the partons lose almost all their energy and the different energy loss rates for gluons and quarks are insignificant ; ( 2 ) the forward - rapidity partons ( mostly quarks ) traverse more matter ( longitudinally ) than the mid - rapidity partons ( mostly gluons ) , almost perfectly cancelling the difference in their energy loss rates ; and ( 3 ) the physics may just be the same between gluon- and quark - jets and between mid- and forward rapidities .",
    "futher studies are needed in order to discriminate these different scenarios .",
    "experimentally , for instance , cu+cu collisions and more peripheral au+au data may shed more light on ( 1 ) and moving to other forward rapidities may give insight into ( 2 ) .",
    "theoretically , calculations of parton energy loss and the resulting angular correlations at both mid- and forward - rapididity will be essential to disentangle the underlying physics processes .",
    "we have presented jet - like azimuthal correlations of charged hadrons at forward rapidities ( @xmath1 , @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 ) measured by the star ftpcs with high-@xmath0 charged trigger particles at mid - rapidity ( @xmath4 , @xmath5  gev/@xmath3 ) measured by the main tpc .",
    "preliminary results are reported for @xmath6 , d+au , and au+au collisions at @xmath7  gev .",
    "near - side correlations are absent from @xmath6 and d+au collisions .",
    "near - side correlations in au+au collisions are consistent with zero within the systematic uncertainties for @xmath16  gev/@xmath3 . however , the high associated @xmath0 data ( @xmath31  gev/@xmath3 ) in central au+au collisions suggest a finite near - side correlation , which may indicate the presence of long range @xmath9 correlations at forward rapidities .",
    "away - side jet - like correlation signals are observed at forward rapidities .",
    "while the correlation shapes are similar , the correlation strength at the d - side is a factor of 2 smaller than that at the au - side in d+au collisions , and the @xmath6 result is approximately equal to the average of the two .",
    "the gluon anti - shadowing and the emc effect would yield an enhanced d - side correlation .",
    "the data are in qualitative agreement with small-@xmath11 gluon suppression in the au - nucleus by the color glass condensate .",
    "quantitative calculations of the color glass condensate and possibly other physics mechanisms , such as energy degrading of the incoming deuteron from multiple scatterings in the au - nucleus , are needed in order to further our understanding .",
    "the away - side correlation in au+au collisions at forward rapidities broadens with centrality .",
    "the correlation shapes are similar to those at mid - rapidity .",
    "the similarity suggests a similar energy loss picture at mid- and forward rapidities .",
