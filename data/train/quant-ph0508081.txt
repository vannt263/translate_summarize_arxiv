    "since the concept of the quantum computer ( qc ) was proposed @xcite , many quantum algorithms @xcite that are superior to classical algorithms have been proposed .",
    "these algorithms have inspired many researchers , and the number of the researchers investigating the qc has increased dramatically as a result .",
    "though many results are generated daily , there remains a serious problem .",
    "the generated quantum circuits utilize the properties of quantum mechanics effectively , but almost all of then are modifications or combinations of just three quantum circuits based on quantum fourier transformation @xcite , quantum amplitude amplification @xcite or discrete quantum random walk @xcite .",
    "this indicates that it is very hard to design new quantum circuits that use the properties of quantum mechanics effectively .",
    "recently , some frameworks differing from the qc have been proposed , such as the adiabatic quantum computer ( aqc)@xcite , and the continuous random walk @xcite , and many results have been forthcoming in this area . in this paper , we focus on the aqc , whose procedure is identified by a hamiltonian .",
    "recently , it was proved that the calculation power of the aqc has the same as that of the qc @xcite .",
    "this means that the qc can be emulated using the aqc and vice versa with polynomial time and space with respect to the input size . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the problems that the qc and aqc are good at are different .",
    "these two facts indicate that new concepts of quantum circuits must be given by the explicit modification from the hamiltonians for the aqc into finite size quantum circuits for the qc . we think this is a good strategy for designing new quantum circuits that use the properties of quantum mechanics effectively .    in this paper , we propose a new quantum circuit modified from a hamiltonian for the aqc .",
    "this is the first simple example of a quantum circuit obtained by following the above strategy . here",
    ", we treat the well - investigated problem in the qc , i.e. , the quantum search problem , in order to check the efficiency of the strategy . as a result",
    ", we get a new quantum circuit that is superior to the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm in some cases .",
    "the hamiltonian just gives us some hints , and the new quantum circuit is intuitively generated using those hints .",
    "thus , we can not show some explicit procedures for the modification .    here",
    ", we have to mention that , from the past work @xcite , quantum circuits for the qc can be easily modified from the hamiltonians for the aqc , but the quantum circuits generated by the modification simply follow the time evolution of the aqc .",
    "consequently , such quantum circuits are very redundant and inefficient for realistic calculations .",
    "the quantum circuits that we want to modify from the hamiltonians are not such useless quantum circuits but practical ones .    to avoid any confusion",
    ", we should clarify that our circuit is superior in that it may be executed faster than grover s algorithm in realistic systems since it uses only simple operators , each of which rotate just one - qubit , except for the oracle .",
    "however , the circuit does not offer reduced complexity .",
    "actually , both it and grover s algorithm have exactly the same complexity @xmath0 . for these reasons",
    ", the superiority of the new circuit will be meaningful mainly to experimentalists .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : grover_algorithm ] , we briefly review grover s algorithm to facilitate comparison between it and the expressions for the new quantum circuit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : g_algorithm ] , we show the explicit form of the new quantum circuit and prove that the quantum circuit can execute quantum search efficiently . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical_calculation ] , we numerically simulate the new quantum circuit to show how well it executes quantum search . in sec .",
    "[ sec : relation_aqc ] , we show the relations between quantum circuits and hamiltonians for the aqc .",
    "these relations are the hints for generating the new quantum circuit .",
    "the last section summarizes our conclusions .",
    "technical details of a proof are in appendix [ sec : proof_of_lemma ] .",
    "by grover s algorithm , the quantum search problem can be solved .",
    "this means that we can find integer @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 using the oracle operator @xmath4 such that @xmath5 by the algorithm .",
    "the operator @xmath4 acts on two registers : one is @xmath6-dimensional , corresponding to the search space , and the other is @xmath7-dimensional , corresponding to the output of the oracle .",
    "grover s algorithm can be expressed as follows .",
    "first , we generate the initial state @xmath8 next , we iterate the two operations , which are identified by the following operator : @xmath9 note that , in general @xmath10 is written by @xmath11 , e.g. , @xcite , and is called the grover operator . the number of iterations is @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] indicates the integer part of real number @xmath14 .",
    "note that the operator @xmath15 ( [ eq : def_oracle_gr ] ) is outwardly different from the oracle operator @xmath16 ( [ eq : def_oracle ] ) ; however , @xmath15 can be simulated from one use of @xmath16 by using the second register as an ancilla prepared in state @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we observe the state using the computational basis , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19,@xmath20 , @xmath21 . the success probability of grover s algorithm , i.e. , the probability to detect the state @xmath22 , goes to @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to the following relation : @xmath25 the scaling of the success probability versus @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : math_glover_algirism ] ) can be easily proved as follows .",

    "then , we restrict the hilbert space to the two dimensional space , i.e. , @xmath29 in this proof . under this restriction",

    "we propose a new quantum circuit by which the grover iteration can be replaced .",
    "the outline of the algorithm is the same as grover s algorithm , but in order to avoid misunderstanding we show whole algorithm below .",
    "first , we prepare the initial state @xmath34 , which is the same as the initial state of grover s algorithm .",

    "the operator @xmath39 and the function @xmath40 are defined later .",
    "finally , we observe the state using the computational basis .",
    "the success probability of this algorithm goes to @xmath23 in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "this is equivalent to the following relation : @xmath42 the scaling of the success probability versus @xmath26 is @xmath43 a proof of relation ( [ eq : suggestion_1 ] ) is located at the end of this section .    here , we have to note three things .",
    "first , the scaling of the number of oracle calls is @xmath0 for any @xmath38 when @xmath44 . here",
    ", we have to point out that the operator @xmath45 ( [ eq : def_oracle_go ] ) can actually be simulated by a constant number of calls to the oracle @xmath16 ( [ eq : def_oracle ] ) , where the number depends on @xmath37 .",
    "a method of simulation is as follows .",
    "we introduce a naturally generalized oracle as @xmath46 for arbitrary integer @xmath47 .",
    "the operator @xmath48 ( [ eq : def_oracle_ge ] ) acts on two registers : one is @xmath6-dimensional and the other is @xmath47-dimensional .",
    "it is easy to show that this operator @xmath48 can be simulated by a constant number of calls to the oracle @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath45 can be simulated from one use of @xmath49 by using the second register as ancillae prepared in state @xmath50 in this definition , @xmath47 and @xmath51 are chosen so as to satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "then , the operator @xmath45 can be simulated by @xmath16 .",
    "second , the difference in execution time between @xmath4 and @xmath45 probably will not depend on @xmath26 in most cases .",
    "this expectation comes form the following consideration .",
    "once we know the explicit circuit for @xmath4 , we will probably be able to make a circuit corresponding to @xmath48 in such a way that the difference of execution time of these two circuits does not depend on @xmath26 .",
    "this expectation has no meaning from a computer science point of view , since the oracle @xmath16 is usually treated as a black - box .",
    "however , in case of actual calculations using a real system , it is important to think in term of the execution time of operations .",
    "third , when @xmath53 , the relation ( [ eq : suggestion_1 ] ) does not hold .",
    "this is related to the fact that the value @xmath37 influences not only the number of iterations @xmath54 but also the speed of the convergence ( [ eq : suggestion_1 ] ) . for example ,",
    "when @xmath37 approaches @xmath55 , the speed of the convergence decreases . on the other hand , when @xmath37 approaches @xmath2 , the speed of the convergence increases . here",
    ", the change in the speed means the change in the constant factor of the scaling .    here",
    ", we define the function @xmath40 and the operator @xmath39 used in the above outline of the algorithm .",
    "first , @xmath39 is the operator which acts only on the @xmath56-th qubit , and the action on the qubit can be written as @xmath57 using the computational basis .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath39 as follows : @xmath58 note that @xmath59 is simply pauli operator @xmath60 applied on qubit @xmath56 .",
    "next , we define @xmath40 implicitly as follows : @xmath61 @xmath62{}-\\frac{2\\pi}{n}<\\varphi\\left(\\omega\\right)<\\frac{2\\pi}{n},\\quad\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\omega\\right)=\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\varphi\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right ) \\label{eq : definition_alpha_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 recall that @xmath6 is the number of elements in the set from which item @xmath1 is selected and that @xmath37 is an arbitrary number in the region @xmath38 .",
    "note that the function @xmath40 depends on @xmath26 .",
    "as an example , a plot of the function @xmath40 for @xmath64 is shown in fig [ fig : varphi ] .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to proving relation ( [ eq : suggestion_1 ] ) .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "first of all , we show the main idea underlying this proof in order to provide some insight into why it works .",
    "the idea consists of three parts .",
    "first , @xmath65 leaves @xmath66 ( [ eq : modified_total_spin ] ) eigenspaces invariant , and both @xmath28 and @xmath22 lie in the same eigenspace , so we can restrict our study to this eigenspace .",
    "second , @xmath28 and @xmath22 have most of their support on the @xmath7-dimensional subspace spanned by two particular eigenstates of @xmath65 , @xmath67 whose eigenvalues are @xmath68 ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) , so we can even more restrict our study to this subspace . finally , due to the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath68 , we need to repeat @xmath65 a certain number of times ( [ eq : suggestion_2 ] ) to rotate @xmath28 to @xmath22 .",
    "based on this idea , we obtain a strict proof as follows .",
    "the operator @xmath69 is a block diagonal matrix in the case of the computational basis and each block can be characterised by eigenvalues of the operator @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is @xmath2 or @xmath23 such that @xmath73 note that the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 defined by ( [ eq : modified_pauli ] ) reduce to the pauli operators in the special case j=0 .",
    "otherwise , the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 are equivalent to the pauli operators up to an overall phase .",
    "the states @xmath28 and @xmath22 belong to the subspace whose eigenvalue for @xmath66 is @xmath76 .",
    "this subspace reduces to the maximal total spin subspace in the special case @xmath77 . in the rest of this section",
    ", we restrict the hilbert space to this subspace and use the following two bases @xmath78 note that it is easy to see that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then , over all phases are defined in such a way that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath85 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath86 for @xmath69 satisfy the relation @xmath87 then , the following two relations hold : @xmath88 in the derivation of the above two relations , we use the relation @xmath89    next , we show that there are two eigenvalue series @xmath90 for the operator @xmath69 such that @xmath91 where we regard @xmath68 as two series with respect to @xmath26 defined by @xmath37 . in order to prove this relation , we use the following relation @xmath92 recall that the function @xmath40 is defined by ( [ eq : definition_alpha_2 ] ) .",
    "this relation is derived from @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "relation ( [ eq : limit_of_definition_w_r_t_varphi ] ) is a special case of the following lemma .    *",
    "_ lemma _ : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a meromorphic function in the region @xmath97 and has only one pole at point @xmath98 .",
    "( a proof of this lemma is given in appendix [ sec : proof_of_lemma ] . ) then , relation ( [ eq : asymptotics_of_alpha ] ) is proved .",
    "now , we define two functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 it is clear that @xmath102 is equal to @xmath2 from condition ( [ eq : definition_of_eigenvalue ] ) .",
    "then , the sufficient condition of ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) , @xmath103 @xmath104 { } \\zeta\\in\\mathbb{c},\\quad \\zeta\\neq0,\\ ] ] is derived by using relation ( [ eq : asymptotics_of_alpha ] ) and lemma ( [ eq : limit_relation ] ) . in the first equality",
    ", we make the laurent expansion at @xmath98 . in the second equality , we just exchange the order of the limit operations . in the last equality , we use relation ( [ eq : asymptotics_of_alpha ] ) and lemma ( [ eq : limit_relation ] ) .",
    "then , relation ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) is proved .",
    "next , we show the relations @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 means the summation with respect to all values @xmath108 corresponding to eigenvalues of @xmath69 except for @xmath68 . from relation ( [ eq : definition_of_eigenvector ] ) , @xmath109 in the second equality , we use ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) , and in the third equality , we use ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) , ( [ eq : asymptotics_of_alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : limit_relation ] ) . on the other hand , from relation ( [ eq : original_relation ] ) , @xmath110 is derived . using relations ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_4 ] ) , relation ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_1 ] )",
    "is proved .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_4 ] ) and the trivial relation @xmath111 ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_2 ] ) is derived .",
    "using some relations proved above , we obtain @xmath112 in the second equality , we use relation ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_2 ] ) , in the third equality we use relation ( [ eq : asymptotic_propaty_1 ] ) , and in the last one we use ( [ eq : inportant_eignevalue ] ) and ( [ eq : suggestion_2 ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ eq : end_of_proof_of_go ] ) is exactly the same as ( [ eq : suggestion_1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath33      when there are two solutions , we also modify grover s algorithm in the same way",
    ". however , we have to know humming distance @xmath113 of the two solutions .",
    "this information is not used in grover s algorithm .",
    "when we change the number of solutions , all we have to do is to change the definition of @xmath40 and @xmath54 as follows : @xmath114{}\\times\\cot\\frac{\\left(s_1+s_2\\right)\\varphi_2\\left(\\omega\\right)}2 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath115{}-\\frac{2\\pi}{n}<\\varphi_2\\left(\\omega\\right)<\\frac{2\\pi}{n},\\quad   \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\omega\\right)=\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\varphi_2\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right ) , \\label{eq : definition_alpha_2_second}\\ ] ] @xmath116 , \\label{eq : suggestion_2_second}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` @xmath7 '' of @xmath40 and @xmath54 indicates just the number of solutions",
    ". then , the operator @xmath117 and the oracle @xmath45 become @xmath118 the success probability goes to @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to the following relation : @xmath119 we can prove this relation in the same way as we have done in the one solution case , so we omit it .",
    "we believe that the same relations hold when there are more than two solutions , and we numerically checked this fact in several cases .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to check that the new quantum circuit works well , we numerically calculated the iteration number , i.e. , @xmath54 defined by ( [ eq : suggestion_2 ] ) , and the error rate , i.e. , @xmath120 , at @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the results are shown in table [ fig : wide ] . in order to compare the proposed quantum circuit with the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm",
    ", we also show the corresponding values for grover s algorithm in the table .",
    "note that , @xmath54 and @xmath40 when @xmath123 are defined in the same way as the other four example , i.e. ( [ eq : suggestion_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : definition_alpha_2 ] ) .    from the result when @xmath123 , we predict that the relation @xmath124{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds when case @xmath123 .",
    "this relation may be proved in a way similar to that in the other @xmath37 case .",
    "this relation means that we can probably use the quantum circuit , i.e. @xmath125 , for the quantum search problem even when @xmath123 , though the error rate for the circuit will be much bigger than that in other @xmath37 cases .",
    "what we want to mention about the results for the cases @xmath126 is that the error rate is sufficiently small for realistic @xmath26 cases . on the other hand ,",
    "it is fair to point out that with the algorithm using the new quantum circuit , the number of iterations and the error rate are much higher than in grover s algorithm .",
    "however , the results do not provide enough information for us to discuss the efficiency of the two algorithms .",
    "we remark that operator @xmath127 is a really multi - particle operator , whereas operator @xmath117 is just a set of single - particle rotation , i.e. , a direct product of single - qubit operators .",
    "the `` really multi - particle operators '' are those that can not be expressed only by products of single - qubit operators .",
    "therefore , operator @xmath117 can be executed much faster than @xmath127 in many realistic systems .",
    "then , the average time to find solution @xmath1 by the algorithm using the new quantum circuit is shorter than that by grover s algorithm in some cases on a realistic qc .",
    "the quantum circuit proposed in this paper is inspired by farhi s hamiltonian @xcite for the aqc . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the aqc , point out the simple relation between the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm and roland s hamiltonian @xcite for quantum search on the aqc , and finally point out the similar relation between the proposed quantum circuit and farhi s hamiltonian for quantum search on the aqc . recall that to generate a new quantum circuit , we assumed the existence of operator @xmath117 related to farhi s hamiltonian as an analogy of the relation between the grover operator and roland s hamiltonian .",
    "this relation is shown below .",
    "then , we find the explicit expression of operator @xmath117 , i.e. , ( [ eq : def_oracle_go_g ] ) .    the aqc involve the following procedures .",
    "first , we define the parametrised hermitian matrix @xmath128 that has the following five properties .",
    "* the operator @xmath128 is continuously changed with respect to parameter @xmath129 . * the ground state of @xmath130 is a simple general state . *",
    "the ground state of @xmath131 is an encoded solution of the problem .",
    "* at any @xmath132 , the ground state of @xmath128 does not degenerate . *",
    "the hamiltonian can be easily defined using only the definition of the problem , i.e. , the hamiltonian can be defined without knowing the result .",
    "second , we prepare the initial state that is the ground state of @xmath133 .",
    "third , we make the time evolution of the state such that @xmath134 @xmath135 { } \\mu\\left(0\\right)=0\\quad \\mu\\left(1\\right)=1\\quad \\frac d{dr}\\mu\\left(r\\right)>0.\\ ] ] note that @xmath136 can be chosen arbitrarily until the above conditions are satisfied , but the choice affects the probability of success and the time for the calculation .",
    "finally , we observe the state at time @xmath137 . if @xmath138 is sufficiently large , the correct solution is obtained , i.e. , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a ground state of the operator @xmath128 .",
    "a suitable value of @xmath138 can be found from the adiabatic theorem .",
    "this is a rough sketch of the aqc .",
    "next , we show the relation between the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm and roland s hamiltonian for quantum search @xcite on the aqc .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath141 executes quantum search , where @xmath34 and @xmath142 mean the same state and value as those in the previous section , i.e. , ( [ def : initial_state ] ) and ( [ def : theta ] ) , and @xmath1 is the target of the search .",
    "the above function @xmath143 is optimised so as to maximize the success probability . from this expression",
    ", it is readily known that @xmath144 where the operators @xmath127 and @xmath15 are defined by ( [ eq : def_oracle_gr ] ) and @xmath145 satisfies the condition that the gap between the two lowest eigenvalues of @xmath146 becomes the minimum value at the point @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , by some calculations , we can check that @xmath148 where @xmath149 $ ] is an integer .",
    "this relation means that the optimal speed of an aqc using roland s hamiltonian is exactly the same as the speed of grover s algorithm with respect to quantum search .",
    "next , we show the relation between the quantum circuit proposed in this paper and farhi s hamiltonian @xcite for quantum search on an aqc .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath150 also executes quantum search .",
    "as is easily shown , the following relation holds @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a real number . relations ( [ rel : grover_adiabatic_1 ] ) and ( [ rel : go_adiabatic_1 ] ) are very similar .",
    "however , we can only check that the leading term of @xmath153 as a function of @xmath26 is the same as that of @xmath154 , where at the point @xmath155 the gap between the two lowest eigenvalues of @xmath156 becomes the minimum value .",
    "unfortunately , we have not yet found a relation like ( [ rel : grover_adiabatic_2 ] ) in this case .",
    "what we want to say in this section is that there are some relations between the quantum circuits for the qc and the hamiltonians for the aqc , and these relations can be used to generate new quantum circuits .",
    "some people may think that these relations are trivial or just accidental things .",
    "however , it is a truth that the proposed quantum circuit is found on the basis of the conviction that there must be an operator @xmath117 related to ( [ eq : hamiltonian_farhi ] ) as an analogy of the relation between @xmath157 and ( [ eq : hamiltonian_roland ] ) , i.e. , ( [ rel : grover_adiabatic_1 ] ) and ( [ rel : grover_adiabatic_2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we believe that there are more hidden relations between quantum circuits and hamiltonians and that they would be powerful instruments for generating new quantum circuits and new hamiltonians .",
    "we have proposed a new quantum circuit for the quantum search problem .",
    "this quantum circuit is superior to the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm in some cases on a realistic quantum computer .",
    "the reasons for this superiority in short are as follows : in the quantum circuit proposed in this paper , all the operators except for the oracle are direct products of single - qubit gates . in the quantum circuit used in grover s algorithm , there are the operators other than the oracle , which are really multi - particle operators . on the other hand , it is a fact that the product of single - qubit gates can be executed much faster than multi - particle operators in many realistic systems .",
    "in addition , the scaling of the number of oracle calls for this circuit is the same as that for grover s algorithm , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "the proposed circuit is found by a comparison of circuits for the quantum computer and hamiltonian for the adiabatic quantum computer .",
    "this fact indicates that the comparison is probably one of the powerful instruments for finding efficient new quantum circuits .",
    "one aspect of future work is to find a stricter relation between the quantum circuits for the quantum computer and the hamiltonians for the adiabatic quantum computer that gives sufficient data for modification from the hamiltonians into the quantum circuits .",
    "then , we will be able to automatically generate other efficient quantum circuits from hamiltonians for the adiabatic quantum computer with respect to other problems that the adiabatic quantum computer is good at and discover new concepts for quantum circuits .",
    "the author wish to thank y. kawano , s. tani , y. takahashi and y. nakajima for discussions and valuable comments .",
    "here , we prove lemma ( [ eq : limit_relation ] ) .      the sufficient condition of ( [ eq : limit_relation ] ) is the relation @xmath158 @xmath159 we can check this as follows : @xmath160{}+\\sum_{q=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac sn-\\frac12\\right)^qf^{(q ) } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{q=-\\lambda}^{-1}f^{(q ) }   \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\sum_{s=1}^{n}p_n\\left(s\\right ) \\left(\\frac sn\\right)^q \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } { } + \\sum_{q=0}^{\\infty}f^{(q ) }   \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\sum_{s=1}^{n}p_n\\left(s\\right)\\left(\\frac sn-\\frac12\\right)^q \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{q=-\\lambda}^{-1}f^{(q ) } 2^{-q}+f^{(0 ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & f\\left(\\frac12\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is defined as @xmath162 the ( [ eq : sufficient_condition ] ) is used in the third equality .",

    "<S> the quantum circuit is superior to grover s algorithm in some realistic cases . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for the superiority are in short as follows : in the quantum circuit proposed in this paper , all the operators except for the oracle can be written as direct products of single - qubit gates . </S>",
    "<S> such separable operators can be executed much faster than multi - particle operators , such as c - not gates and toffoli gates , in many realistic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of this quantum circuit is inspired by the hamiltonian used in the adiabatic quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the scaling of the number of oracle calls for this circuit is the same as that for grover s algorithm , i.e. @xmath0 . </S>"
