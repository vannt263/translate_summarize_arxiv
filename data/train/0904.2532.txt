    "the past few years have seen an explosion of newly synthesized colloidal ( nano-)particles that are _ not _ spherically symmetric , either by shape ( e.g. dumbbells , snowmen , cubes ) or by surface pattern ( patches , stripes ) @xcite .",
    "a broken rotational symmetry also occurs when particles are adsorbed to air - water or oil - water interfaces @xcite , as in for example , colloidal monolayers @xcite , pickering emulsions @xcite , or bijels @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent atomic force microscopy studies have shown that even supposedly homogeneous colloidal surfaces can actually be heterogeneous on length scales as large as 100 nm @xcite , while atomic corrugations and facets render any nm - sized particle strictly heterogeneous .",
    "an important consequence of surface heterogeneity is anisotropy of the mutual effective forces , which directly affects the self - assembly process of the ( nano)colloids into large - scale structures , for instance into ill - understood linear chains @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem is thus to establish relationships between shape and surface heterogeneity on the one hand and effective interactions and large - scale self - assembly structures on the other @xcite .",
    "apart from specific forces ( e.g. , hydrophobic , van der waals ) the effective interactions between dispersed particles often involve a strong generic electrostatic component , which is well - described , for homogeneously charged objects , by linear - screening theory _ provided _ renormalized charges instead of bare charges are used @xcite .",
    "renormalization of heterogeneously distributed surface charge is an open problem , for which we develop a systematic theory in this paper .",
    "we go beyond recent linear screening treatments @xcite and formulate a new and efficient framework for computing _ nonlinear _ ionic screening effects of heterogeneously charged spheres dispersed in a 1:1 electrolyte .",
    "our theory generalizes alexander s notion of ion - condensation induced charge - renormalization @xcite to include not only the monopole but also the dipole , quadrupole , etc .",
    ", as well as their nonlinear couplings .",
    "these multipole modes can be important if one wishes to calculate the electrostatic force between particles , which was already shown for clay platelets @xcite .",
    "our scheme is versatile and can be applied to essentially any type of charge heterogeneity .",
    "we focus on applications to janus spheres composed of two differently charged hemispheres @xcite .",
    "we consider an index - matched suspension of @xmath0 colloidal spheres of radius @xmath1 in a bulk solvent of dielectric constant @xmath2 and volume @xmath3 at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the solvent also contains point - like monovalent cations ( charge @xmath5 ) and anions ( charge @xmath6 ) at fugacity @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the elementary charge .",
    "a relatively simple treatment of this many - body problem is the cell model @xcite , in which a single colloid is considered in the center of a spherical cell of radius @xmath9 and volume @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the surface charge density of this central colloidal particle by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the standard polar and azimuthal angle , respectively , with respect to a laboratory frame . within a mean - field approximation ,",
    "the concentration profiles of the cations and anions can be written as boltzmann distributions @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the electrostatic potential at @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 in the salt reservoir , and that @xmath20 for @xmath21 due to hard - core exclusion . the potential must satisfy the poisson equation @xmath22 , where we defined the bjerrum length @xmath23 .",
    "combining the poisson and boltzmann equations gives @xmath24 where a prime denotes a radial derivative , @xmath25 $ ] the _ angular momentum operator _ , and @xmath26 the screening length . on the colloidal surface , @xmath27 , gauss",
    "law imposes the boundary condition ( bc ) @xmath28 electro - neutrality of the cell imposes @xmath29 at @xmath30 , which is a sufficiently stringent bc to close the system of equations in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "now , however , an additional bc is to be specified for the angular dependence at @xmath30 , depending on the environment of the cell . for now , we assume an environment that is characterized by ` isotropic ' boundary conditions , @xmath31 we will discuss this choice , and its consequences , in section [ discussion ] .",
    "for a given @xmath32 one can solve with bc s for @xmath33 , for example , numerically on a discrete @xmath34 grid . the approach we take , however , avoids a cumbersome 3-dimensional grid in favor of a systematic expansion of the angular dependence in spherical harmonics . for notational convenience and illustration purposes we restrict attention here to @xmath13-independent cases where the expansion involves only legendre polynomials @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the first step in this analysis is the decomposition of the colloidal surface charge into surface multipoles @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 .",
    "similarly we decompose @xmath39 . with @xmath40 the regular solution to ( [ pb ] ) for @xmath41 $ ] , the bc s for @xmath42 , @xmath43 conveniently decouple for the different @xmath44 s .",
    "by contrast , the nonlinear @xmath45 term in ( [ pb ] ) induces ` mode - coupling ' between _ all _ legendre components @xmath46  not to be confused with mode - couplings in dynamical slowing down .",
    "this coupling is obviously unpractical for a numerical treatment .",
    "the second step of our analysis resolves this mode - coupling problem by ` ordering ' the modes systematically .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless ` switching ' parameter @xmath47 , and consider the auxiliary distribution @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 describes a homogeneous distribution and @xmath50 the heterogeneous one of interest .",
    "we also define the corresponding auxiliary potential @xmath51 , where @xmath52 sets the order of the truncation and where the expansion coefficients can themselves be expanded as @xmath53 .",
    "the functions @xmath54 are independent of @xmath47 and will be calculated numerically below for the cases of interest @xmath55 ( which is assumed implicitly from now on ) .",
    "since the problem is invariant under the simultaneous transformation @xmath56 and @xmath57 one checks that @xmath58 for @xmath59 odd , that is , we only consider @xmath44 and @xmath60 both even or both odd .",
    "replacing @xmath61 by @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath64 , inserting the corresponding expansions into the bc s , and equating all orders of @xmath47 yields at @xmath65 and @xmath30 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the kronecker - delta .",
    "when the same replacement and expansion procedure is applied to the pb equation ( [ pb ] ) , one finds upon expanding the argument of the @xmath45 term with respect to @xmath47 a hierarchy of second - order differential equations for @xmath54 , with a structure that allows for an order - by - order sequential solution .",
    "for @xmath68 we obtain for @xmath69 $ ] the spherically symmetric nonlinear pb equation in the cell , @xmath70 , which we solve explicitly with the bc s given in ( [ gauss3 ] ) and ( [ bciso3 ] ) on a radial grid .",
    "we thus consider @xmath71 as a known function from now on .",
    "for @xmath72 we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 acts as a source term of the form @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and explicit expressions for higher - order terms can be generated straightforwardly .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath80 _ only _ depends on @xmath81 s with @xmath82 , that is , a hierarchy of terms follows spontaneously .",
    "thus with the bc s ( [ gauss3 ] ) and ( [ bciso3 ] ) can be solved for @xmath83 , which in turn determines @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be solved , etc .",
    "the nonlinear mode - coupling , represented explicitly by @xmath88 and @xmath74 , renders the linear equation highly nontrivial , yet numerical solution on a radial grid @xmath69 $ ] is straightforward . with @xmath54",
    "determined for @xmath89 for some cut - off @xmath52 , we can set @xmath50 to explicitly construct the potential of interest @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the theory developed so far is directly applicable to any uniaxial charge distribution , while generalizations to azimuthal dependencies and nonspherical shapes are feasible . in this paper",
    "we illustrate our scheme for the prototype heterogeneous charge distribtion of janus spheres characterized by surface charge - densities @xmath92 and @xmath93 on the northern @xmath94 and southern ( @xmath95 ) hemisphere , respectively @xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing modes are thus @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath44 odd . here",
    "we defined the dimensionless heterogeneity parameter @xmath98 which together with the total charge @xmath99 fully characterizes the distribution .",
    "below we set @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 throughout unless stated otherwise , and we identify @xmath103 as the only other relevant dimensionless combination . for @xmath104 and @xmath105 figure 1(a ) shows the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath106 ( inset ) and @xmath107 for several @xmath108 , revealing isotropy ( as expected ) for a homogeneous surface charge ( @xmath109 , arrows ) and strong anisotropy for the heterogeneous cases @xmath110 @xmath111 , dot - dashed ) and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 , solid lines ) ; the ( small ) oscillations with @xmath12 at @xmath27 are numerical artefacts due to the truncation at @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence of the potential weakens , as expected , for increasing distances @xmath108 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows @xmath46 for @xmath114 and @xmath110 .",
    "interestingly , the modes with @xmath115 have a non - vanishing electric field in the interior of the particle .",
    "the overall magnitude and spatial variation of @xmath107 in figure 1 show the need for nonlinear screening theory .",
    "nevertheless , in analogy to the spherically symmetric case @xcite one can describe the far - field potential ( @xmath116 ) and hence the colloidal interactions in terms of _ linear _ screening theory ( dashed curves in figure 1(b ) ) with a renormalized surface charge distribution @xmath117 that we will calculate below .    in the far - field @xmath116",
    "we treat the deviation of @xmath63 from its angular average @xmath118 at @xmath30 as a small expansion parameter , such that ( [ pb ] ) for @xmath119 can be linearized as @xmath120 $ ] with @xmath121 .",
    "the uniaxial solutions to this linear pb ( lpb ) equation read @xmath122p_{\\ell}(x)$ ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are modified spherical bessel functions . the coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 are integration constants that we fix by matching the lpb - solution at @xmath30 , for each @xmath44 , to @xmath127 and @xmath128 of the _ nonlinear _ problem .",
    "this leads for every @xmath44 to the linear two by two problem @xmath129 which results in explicit expressions for @xmath125 and @xmath126 given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "the dashed curves in figure 1(b ) are the result of such a far - field fit . with @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    "explicitly known , one can extrapolate the lpb solution to @xmath27 to yield , with and standard bessel function relations , the renormalized multipoles @xmath132 this expression is the multipole generalization of the well - known charge renormalization @xcite .    a first illustration of multipole renormalization is shown by the angles in figure 1(b ) , which represent slope discontinuities at @xmath27 which are proportional to @xmath133 ( nonlinear theory ) and @xmath134 ( far - field fit ) .",
    "for @xmath135 we see @xmath136 , which means that the effective charge and dipole are renormalized downward .",
    "interestingly , however , for @xmath137 the inset in the lowest panel reveals upward renormalization since @xmath138 while @xmath139 , that is , the janus particle has a mode - coupling induced far - field quadrupole signature .",
    "multipole renormalization is quantified further in figures 24 , where ( scaled ) renormalized multipoles @xmath140 are shown for the monopole @xmath141 in figure 2 , the dipole @xmath142 in figure 3 ( scaled with @xmath143 ) , and the higher - order multipoles @xmath144 in figure 4 .",
    "all multipoles are shown as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , in figure 2 and 3 we chose several truncation levels @xmath52 and heterogeneities @xmath143 , and also picked two cell radii @xmath9 .",
    "the dot - dashed curves denote the linear limit @xmath145 .",
    "figure 2 and 3 show that all curves for @xmath102 superimpose on those of @xmath146 for all @xmath147 and @xmath148 , indicative of excellent convergence in this parameter regime ; for @xmath149 the convergence deteriorates for @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence in figure 2 and 3 shows the strongest renormalization in the largest cell , not unlike the homogeneous - charge case @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the nonlinear regime @xmath151 figure 2 shows a mode - coupling induced _ reduction _ of @xmath152 by 10 s of percents when @xmath143 increases from 0 to 1 . in other words , in contrast to the more usual ` linear ' electrostatics we now have a far - field monopole potential that is not only determined by the net charge but in fact _ also _ by its heterogeneity .",
    "this is a key finding , relevant for understanding patchy - particle interactions .",
    "the mode coupling has an even stronger effect on renormalization of @xmath153 , for which figure 3(a ) and ( b ) show a pronounced maximum in between the low-@xmath147 linear screening regime and the high-@xmath147 regime in which @xmath153 becomes even _ vanishingly small _ for all @xmath143 s considered .",
    "figure 4 shows , for @xmath154 , that in fact _ all _ @xmath155 with @xmath156 vanish in the limit of large @xmath147 , while they all show an intermediate regime with finite values even for @xmath157 for which @xmath158 .",
    "the underlying physics for non - oppositely charged hemispheres with @xmath159 ( that is , with @xmath160 ) is that both @xmath92 and @xmath93 renormalize , if both are high enough , to the _ same _ saturated value , giving rise to a pure far - field monopole without multipoles .",
    "+ the idea might emerge that both hemispheres renormalize their charge independent of each other , that is , some of the results could suggest that the renormalized charge density on the colloidal surface is a function which depends only locally on the bare charge density .",
    "if that were the case , it would suffice to calculate the renormalized surface charge - density for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as if both were the charge density of a monopole .",
    "the cell radius is to be kept unchanged .",
    "the thick dotted lines in figure 3(a ) and ( b ) denote the resulting dipole charge for @xmath112 , which is calculated with the obtained ( renormalized ) @xmath161 and @xmath162 by @xmath163 .",
    "the correspondence with the solid line is at best reasonable but not perfect . also the effective monopole is not accurately predicted .",
    "this can can be seen from figure 5 , where we investigate the cell - size dependence of the the effective monopole for @xmath164 and for @xmath165 .",
    "we included data from the full theory ( depicted by symbols ) and the predicted values by @xmath166 as a solid line .",
    "one can see that the monopole charge is underestimated for a wide range of cell radii , especially for larger cells .",
    "nevertheless , there is qualitative agreement on the increase of the renormalized charge with higher values for @xmath167 .",
    "the difference with the full theory is expected to be the largest for very heterogeneously charged particles .",
    "indeed , we see the largest discrepancy in figure 5(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath112 , with deviations up to @xmath168@xmath169% between the results of the present theory for @xmath170 and those of the simple approximation @xmath171 discussed above .",
    "apparently , the interactions between the hemispheres do play a role , which in fact can can also be concluded from the induced even multipoles in figure 4 .",
    "further research might give more insight into the characteristics of these interactions .",
    "the newly emerging general picture is that nonlinear ionic screening of heterogeneously distributed surface charges strongly affects the far - field symmetry of the potential , and hence also the symmetry of the effective interactions and the self - assembling structures .",
    "the systematics of the present screening theory could be a firm basis to further study these intricate features of heterogeneously charged particles .",
    "the category of particles which are described by @xmath172 , carrying positive and negative charges on the two hemispheres , are particularly interesting .",
    "because the present method is not very efficient at high values of @xmath143 , we have developed an alternative method to treat these mainly dipolar particles within a mode expansion as well .",
    "this will be presented in further work .    it is tempting to model janus spheres by a yukawa - segment model @xcite in which every surface element @xmath173 contributes @xmath174 to the ( dimensionless ) potential at a distance @xmath175 . here",
    "the renormalized charge densities on both hemispheres is obtained from the renormalized monopole and dipole charge density via @xmath176 the dotted curves in figure 1(a ) show that agreement with our full calculations is reasonable though not quantitative ; the yukawa model ignores the ionic hard - core exclusion in the interior of the particle .",
    "therefore , effectively it describes the ( dimensionless ) potential of a charge configuration in which oppositely charged ions were able to approach the heterogeneously charged surface from two sides , such that this potential is more suppressed compared to the full theory .",
    "being a point of discussion , we return to the choice of the boundary conditions on the cell s surface ( [ bciso ] ) , which we called ` isotropic ' bc s .",
    "this denomination follows from the fact that , considering two randomly oriented neighboring cells , the cell - surface potentials of two cells should match on the spot where they touch , giving rise to a constant cell - surface potential .",
    "nevertheless the choice of bc s is not unique .",
    "we can also supply the system with ` nematic ' boundary conditions , corresponding to the situation that all cells are perfectly aligned such that cells only touch on opposite spots . on these spots",
    "the electrostatic potential should match , and we can also demand continuity of the electric field .",
    "the bc s then become @xmath177 in fact one can even interpolate between ` isotropic ' and ` nematic ' bc s by introducing an orientation distribution function @xcite . in this article",
    ", we assume a system in which the cell boundary is best described by isotropic bc s , given by ( [ bciso ] ) .",
    "however , for the parameters used in this article , it turns out that this particular choice for the bc s did not noticeably affect the values of the renormalized charges .",
    "we do not see a significant change by turning to nematic bc s ( [ bcnem ] ) .",
    "this insensitivity to the choice of bc s is due to the fact that the nonlinear behaviour is an effect which takes place close to the colloidal surface , where these bc s have the least influence on the electrostatic potential .",
    "furthermore , the only multipoles which are directly affected by the particular choice of bc s are the nonzero(@xmath178 ) even multipoles , which are small for janus particles .",
    "we therefore think that the obtained values for the renormalized multipoles can be applied in a model to describe the behaviour of a many - body system within linear theory , no matter what the orientations of the surrounding colloids are . since the monopole and multipole potentials decay for large @xmath108",
    "equally fast as @xmath179 @xcite , where @xmath180 is the decay length , the renormalized multipole charges are expected to contribute in dense as well as dilute systems .",
    "+ in summary , we have developed a systematic framework for nonlinear ionic screening of heterogeneously charged spheres .",
    "the scheme allows for an explicit far - field analysis that generalizes charge renormalization from the well - studied homogeneous case ( pure monopole ) @xcite to the heterogeneous case ( dipoles , quadrupoles , etc . and their nonlinear couplings ) .",
    "application to charged janus spheres shows ( i ) a 40% reduction of the effective monopole for @xmath149 ( charged and uncharged hemisphere ) compared to @xmath109 ( homogeneously charged sphere ) , ( ii ) a mode - coupling induced far - field effective quadrupole component without an actual surface quadrupole , ( iii ) a pure far - field monopole with vanishing higher - order multipoles in the saturated high - charge limit , and ( iv ) no quantitative agreement with a simple yukawa - segment model based on renormalized multipoles .",
    "our study opens the way to systematic microscopic calculations of effective electrostatic interactions between janus ( and other patchy ) particles .",
    "in addition , our analyses also reveal non - vanishing electric fields _ inside _ heterogeneously charged particles , which could couple to interior dipoles and affect ( anisotropic ) mutual van der waals forces .",
    "given that the presently introduced expansion technique can be generalized to other geometries ( for example , patterned planar surfaces or ellipsoidal patchy colloids ) , our technique and findings are directly relevant for gaining microscopic understanding of effective interactions and ultimately phase behaviour of a large class of dispersions of patchy or patterned nanoparticles , colloids , or proteins @xcite .",
