    "an intuitive picture of quark - gluon dynamics emerges in the coulomb gauge , @xmath2  @xcite . in this case",
    "qcd is represented as a many - body system of strongly interacting physical quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "in particular the gluon degrees of freedom have only the two transverse polarizations and in the non - interacting limit reduce to the physical massless plane wave states . in the interacting theory",
    "gluonic states , just like any other colored objects , are expected to be non - propagating , _",
    "i.e. _ confined on the hadronic scale",
    ". the non - propagating nature of colored states follows from the infrared enhanced dispersion relations which can be set up in the coulomb gauge  @xcite .    in the coulomb gauge the @xmath3 component of the 4-vector potential results in an instantaneous interaction ( potential ) between color charges . unlike qed , where the corresponding potential is a function only of the relative distance between the electric charges , in qcd it is a functional of the transverse gluon components , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thus the numerical value of the potential can not be obtained without knowing the correct wave functional of the state and its dependence on the gluon coordinates .",
    "so in qcd the chromo - electric field is expected to be non - local and to depend on the global distribution of charges , which set up the gluon wave functional .    even though the exact solution to the general many - body problem is unavailable it is often possible to obtain good approximations if the dominant correlations can be identified . in coulomb gauge qcd ( in the schrdinger field representation )",
    "the domain of the transverse gluon field , @xmath5 is bounded and non - flat , and is referred to as the gribov region . it is expected that the strong interaction between static charges originates from the long - range modes near the boundary of the gribov region , the so called gribov horizon . for example it has been recently shown that center vortices , when transformed to the coulomb gauge , indeed reside on the gribov horizon  @xcite .",
    "the curvature of the gribov region contributes to matrix elements via the functional measure determined by the determinant of the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "this determinant prevents analytical calculations of functional integrals , however it has been shown that its effect can be approximated by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the gluon wave functional  @xcite .",
    "this wave functional is in turn constrained by minimizing the expectation value of the energy density which leads to a set of coupled self - consistent dyson equations  @xcite .",
    "once the wave functional is determined it is possible to calculate the distribution of the chromo - electric field in the system .",
    "this is the main subject of this paper .    in the following",
    "we study the chromo - electric field in the presence of the static quark - antiquark and three - quark systems , prototypes for a meson and a baryon respectively .",
    "recent lattice computations indicate that the gluonic field near the static @xmath6 state forms flux tubes .",
    "there are also indications that for the @xmath1 state the fields arrange in the so called `` y''-shape  @xcite , although some work supports the `` @xmath7''-shape  @xcite .",
    "string - like behavior has been observed in the chromo - electric field in ref .",
    "@xcite and the `` y''-shape interaction advocated in ref .",
    "a recent reevaluation of the center - vortex model also supports the `` y''-shape  @xcite .    in the following section we summarize the relevant elements of the coulomb gauge formalism and discuss the approximations used",

    "there is a fundamental difference between lattice gauge flux tubes corresponding to the distribution for the action density and the chromo - electric field profiles . in the context of the potential energy of the sources ,",
