    "<S> initially , before the slow quench begins ( at @xmath77 within our formalism ) , the correlation function decays algebraically with distance as @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is typical of a luttinger liquid . </S>",

    "<S> changes are minimal as the correlation function still decays algebraically , but the exponent is now determined by the time - dependent luttinger parameter @xmath79 showing up in the exponent  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that for short dimensionless distances , @xmath80 , the correlations react instantaneously to the slow interaction change and adjust to the ground state decay corresponding to the current interaction value ( see panel @xmath68 of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to this mechanism comes from quasiparticles with large momenta @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this adiabatic regime spatially decreases with time and disappears completely when @xmath82 , where @xmath56 is the dimensionless short distance cut - off .    for larger distances , </S>",

    "<S> the position of the dip coincides approximately with the correlation evolution front . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent position of this front can be understood by considering the propagation of quasiparticles . at any given time @xmath57 , </S>",
    "<S> the system hamiltonian is diagonal in its instantaneous quasiparticles as @xmath83 . assuming discrete time steps </S>",
    "<S> , this means that the action of the hamiltonian at time @xmath84 , diagonal in its own quasiparticles , has created ( and annihilated ) entangled quasiparticle pairs @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> these entangled quasiparticles , forming a pair , propagate with velocity @xmath86 in opposite direction and thereby carry correlations over a distance @xmath87 within a time interval @xmath88 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath90 and we find that @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the evolution front beyond which correlations still follow the initial algebraic decay is given by @xmath72 as evidenced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison ] . in particular , the position of the bound does not depend on the ramp velocity and time separately as can be seen in panel @xmath75 of fig  [ fig : comparison ] . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly sees from there that , for a given @xmath54 , the position @xmath55 of the dip ( measured in units of @xmath92 ) is the same for different ramp times . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : theta - correlator ] ) ) and @xmath97 . ]    for larger dimensionless times , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stretched ] , an additional decay regime takes place at intermediate distances before the bound @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this interesting behavior shows up in the bosonization approach and takes the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 a prefactor independent of @xmath55 . for intermediate @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> both exponential terms are required to adequately reproduce the behavior of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theta - correlator ] ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stretched ] . however , for values of @xmath54 whose corresponding bound @xmath72 is located at sufficient large @xmath55 , only the first exponential term is important . in this case single - particle correlations decay with distance as a stretched exponential </S>",
    "<S> , a similar decay was found in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> such a functional form is unconventional for luttinger liquids as , typically , correlations decay algebraically in these systems . even for sudden interaction quenches in both bosonic and fermionic systems  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and for slow quenches in fermionic systems  @xcite , only algebraic decay of correlations have been uncovered .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such an unusual functional form is mainly due to the contribution of quasiparticles with momenta around @xmath100  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the appearance of the stretched exponential decay is limited to large values of @xmath54 , this regime only occurs for relatively large parameter changes @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> it is still an open question , whether this stretched exponential decay regime arises within the bose - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> as this regime only occurs for large parameter changes , the tll model might not describe properly the dynamics of the bose - hubbard model and relaxation mechanisms not present in the tll model might dominate the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> a careful analysis of this last point would be extremely valuable but is left to further studies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental implementation and detection : _ one - dimensional interacting bosonic gases have been realized experimentally using a few different setups  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best scheme to implement time variations of the interaction strength depends on the actual experiment setup . </S>",
    "<S> one method relies on the use of a feshbach resonance by which the scattering length , and thereby the interaction strength , is directly varied . </S>",
    "<S> a second technique is based on the application of a weak optical lattice suppressing the tunneling amplitude in order to change the ratio of the interaction strength to the kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in one - dimensional wave guides , geometric confinement can be employed to tailor the interaction strength .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the single - particle correlation function can also be carried out experimentally . using radio - frequency pulses </S>",
    "<S> , atoms can be outcoupled from the one - dimensional bose gas at two spatially separated positions and their interference is then observed after a free fall . </S>",
    "<S> this technique was successfully employed to measure the build - up of equal - time single - particle correlations in a bose - einstein condensate after a sudden decrease of its temperature and the critical correlations at the phase transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possible detection scheme relies on time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements which provide , in the far - field limit , access to the momentum distribution @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the very long distance behavior of the single - particle correlation is dominated by the luttinger liquid power - law ; however , at a critical wavevector , @xmath103 , determined by the ballistic expansion condition , a crossover occurs and @xmath104 is dominated by the fourier transform of the stretched exponential . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 the atom mass ) a crossover should be visible in the tof measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we foresee that one of the main challenges towards the observation of the evolution of correlations will be the realization of a relatively homogeneous gas as inhomogeneities can cause mass transport and mask the internal evolution  @xcite .    _ conclusion : _ we carefully studied the dynamics of single - particle correlations arising during the slow interaction quench of a one - dimensional bose gas using both a bosonization approach and numerical simulations for the bose - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> we uncovered various regimes : for short distances , we found single - particle correlations to decay algebraically with an exponent which depends on the ramp time ; while for intermediate distances but at long times , the decay of correlations follows a stretched exponential . </S>",
    "<S> this unconventional regime is bounded by an evolution front , reminiscent of a lieb - robinson bound , whose dynamics is dictated by the counter - propagation of entangled quasiparticle pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this regime within the bose - hubbard model remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> deviations between the bose - hubbard and luttinger models were in fact found for fast as well as for very long ramps . finally , beyond this evolution front , correlations decay algebraically with an exponent given by the sudden approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these results may serve as a basis for comparison with future experimental studies of unconventional time evolutions in many - body one - dimensional systems .    </S>",
