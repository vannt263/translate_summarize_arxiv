    "the computation of thermal time - correlation functions is of central importance in chemical physics @xcite in order to evaluate many physically observable quantities such as reaction rates , diffusion constants , spectra and scattering data .",
    "@xcite    exact evaluation of the quantum correlation function scales exponentially with system size and so is impractical for more than a few atoms .",
    "@xcite there is consequently a need for computationally tractable approximations to quantum time - correlation functions @xcite , preferably which are known to be equivalent to the quantum result in certain limits , and for which the likely error is known in advance of calculation .",
    "one crude solution is to use a purely classical correlation function , which will scale linearly with system size .",
    "however , the classical boltzmann distribution is highly inaccurate for many systems such as water at room temperature @xcite , and ignores effects such as tunnelling and zero - point energy .",
    "@xcite there is consequently a need to incorporate quantum statistics into such calculations , but with approximate , preferably classical - like , dynamics .",
    "various approaches have been developed , including the `` classical wigner '' or linearized semiclassical initial value representation ( lsc - ivr ) method @xcite which truncates the ( exact ) moyal series @xcite for time evolution at @xmath0 , centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd ) @xcite , which propagates the path - integral centroid in the mean - field of the other path - integral normal modes , and ring polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd ) @xcite which takes the classical dynamics of a ring polymer @xcite literally .",
    "all these methods have various limitations ; lsc - ivr does not conserve the quantum boltzmann distribution leading to zero - point energy leakage @xcite , whereas cmd and rpmd both fail for multidimensional spectra @xcite ; cmd has the _ curvature problem _ where peaks are broadened and red - shifted whereas rpmd has _",
    "spurious resonances _ where the ring polymer springs couple to frequencies in the potential leading to splitting of the physical peak .",
    "@xcite    recently , thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics ( trpmd ) has been introduced , which applied a langevin thermostat @xcite to the dynamics of the ring polymer @xcite .",
    "this was originally conceived for the evalutation of static properties @xcite , but it appeared to be remarkably successful for the computation of spectra @xcite , accurately replicating multidimensional spectra where cmd and rpmd fail and correctly predicting the diffusion and rotational constants of liquid water .",
    "like rpmd , the short - time , transition - state theory ( tst ) limit of the trpmd flux - side correlation function is identical to quantum transition - state theory ( qtst ) @xcite : the instantaneous thermal ring - polymer flux through a position - space dividing surface is equal to the intantaneous thermal quantum flux , and the trpmd rate will equal the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing by either the quantum dynamics or trpmd dynamics @xcite . because trpmd obeys detailed balance , its reaction rate is independent of the location of the dividing surface @xcite , as is the case for rpmd and cmd but not many tst - based methods .",
    "nevertheless , trpmd is not without its faults ; like rpmd and cmd it fails to capture effects such as a fermi resonance involving a fourth - order coupling in the zundel cation @xcite , and beneath the crossover temperature ( see eq .  )",
    "application of friction to reaction rates causes them to decrease , resulting in a less accurate result compared to rpmd for symmetric systems , and a more accurate result ( but with an adjustable parameter whose value is not determinable in advance ) for asymmetric systems .",
    "@xcite    very recently , both rpmd and cmd have been obtained from the exact quantum time - correlation function via `` matsubara dynamics '' , a form of linearization which conserves the quantum boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "matsubara dynamics results from discarding fluctuations of the very high frequency path - integral normal modes ( higher frequencies than those required to converge the quantum boltzmann distribution ) from the ( exact ) moyal bracket and is inherently classical as well as satisfying detailed balance @xcite .",
    "however , matsubara dynamics is not amenable to computation in large systems since it suffers from the sign problem due to a phase factor in the complex quantum boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "an approximation to matsubara dynamics where the centroid moves in the mean field of the other matsubara modes leads to cmd , and by moving the momentum contour in the quantum boltzmann distribution and discarding the imaginary liouvillian which results , rpmd arises @xcite .",
    "obtaining rpmd and cmd from the exact quantum expression provides analytical expressions for their error from the quantum result , such that it can be known _ a priori _ whether they will function well in a given system , whereas previously one had to rely on induction from earlier numerical studies on systems for which rpmd or cmd had been successful , though there was no guarantee that such reasoning would extend to a new system .",
    "this was seen , for example , in rpmd rate theory failing in the marcus inverted regime @xcite despite being very successful for rate computation in a large variety of other systems @xcite . with the derivation of qtst @xcite",
    ", it can be known _ a priori _ that a system whose optimal ring - polymer dividing surface will be significantly recrossed by the quantum dynamics will not have its rate accurately computed by rpmd @xcite .",
    "consequently , investigating whether trpmd could also be obtained from exact quantum time evolution and thereby discerning the situations where it is likely to work _ a priori _ , rather than relying on the ( small but growing ) literature of its application to physical systems @xcite , would be of considerable benefit to the field .",
    "in this paper we obtain trpmd from exact quantum dynamics by showing that it is a stochastic approximation to matsubara dynamics . to obtain a computationally tractable approximation to matsubara dynamics , we move the momentum contour in the complex plane in order to convert the complex quantum boltzmann distribution into the real ring polymer distribution .",
    "this transformation generates a complex liouvillian in the dynamics @xcite , which is not in itself amenable to computation due to the complex trajectories which result .",
    "previously , the imaginary part of the liouvillian was simply discarded , shifting the oscillation frequencies in the higher normal modes and leading to rpmd , but here we replace it with a fokker - planck term , producing trpmd .    to examine the effect of the friction matrix we conisder a harmonic well and a parabolic barrier , for which the correlation function ( if defined ) can be evaluated analytically .",
    "we find that a unique and system - independent value of the friction matrix causes all normal modes to oscillate at the correct ( external ) frequency in a harmonic well , and illustrate this with the position - squared autocorrelation function , where trpmd has the correct zero - time value and frequency ; neither rpmd nor cmd can reproduce both these properties @xcite .",
    "we then examine a parabolic barrier , where cmd and rpmd have the incorrect fluctuation dynamics ; the higher normal modes in rpmd being bound ( above the relevant crossover temperature , see eq .  ) , rather than unbound as in matsubara dynamics . here",
    "application of any meaningful ( i.e.  positive ) friction does not cause the erroneously bound normal modes in trpmd to become scattering , and nor does it cause unbound modes to have the correct escape frequency , meaning that application of friction is unlikely to assist in the accuracy of reaction rate or diffusion calculation .",
    "@xcite    we begin by revisiting matsubara dynamics in section  [ sec : mat ] , followed by obtaining trpmd in section  [ sec : trpmd ] and examining the friction matrix in section  [ sec : fric ] , before presenting conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",

    "however , the transmission coefficient across a parabolic barrier is unity in matsubara dynamics , and adding friction in trpmd will only decrease this .",
    "consequently , application of friction to rpmd will not ameliorate the qualitative problems with the rpmd higher normal modes at a barrier , and in some cases will worsen them .",
    "the friction matrix @xmath63 obtained section  [ ssec : hw ] corresponds to critical damping of the ring polymer springs in the absence of an external potential , but not critical damping of the ring polymer modes in a harmonic oscillator ( where the external frequency must also be considered ) , and can be determined without knowledge of the frequencies present in the external potential .",
    "obviously , chemical systems will not be purely harmonic but in many systems ( such as vibrating bond ) this will be a reasonable approximation .",
    "previous literature has explored a range of scaled friction matrices of @xmath120 and found @xmath121 to be optimal for some spectra , justifying this on the grounds of optimal sampling of the harmonic ring polymer potential energy @xcite , but also finding there to be a wide range of @xmath65 close to @xmath121 in which results are broadly similar ( as also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lam ] ) .",
    "we suspect that a numerically favourable value of @xmath121 is due to interplay between shifting the frequencies of the higher normal modes to the external frequency ( implying @xmath67 ) , moving the maximum in the spectral peak ( implying @xmath70 ) , and avoiding harsh damping which would decorrelate the modes too quickly to capture their dynamics and broaden spectral peaks @xcite ( implying the weakest possible friction which removes spurious resonances ) .",
    "we can certainly find no reason to use @xmath122 .",
    "this definition of the friction matrix means that @xmath123 ( for all @xmath65 ) meaning that the centroid is unthermostatted , so all the results which have previously been derived for trpmd , such as its short - time error compared to the quantum result @xcite , still hold .",
    "a new result is that trpmd , like rpmd , will have the exact matsubara force on the centroid , since the error term does not act upon the centroid .",
    "like rpmd and cmd but not lsc - ivr , the trpmd dynamics will also satisfy detailed balance @xcite , and the error scaling in the higher normal modes in time will be the same as that for rpmd , namely @xmath44}}- \\mathcal{a}_{\\rm wn}^{[m]\\dag}\\propto 1/\\beta\\hbar$ ] .",
    "this choice of friction matrix also means that the trpmd correlation function of a linear operator will deviate from the matsubara correlation due to higher - order coupling between the centroid dynamics and the damping ( and random kicks ) of the higher normal modes via anharmonicity in the potential .",
    "this causes slight broadening of spectral lines ( a far smaller issue than the curvature problem of cmd or the spurious resonances of rpmd ) @xcite , but the extra friction noticeably slows reaction rates beneath the crossover temperature @xcite where the unbound and thermostatted higher normal modes are part of the optimal dividing surface @xcite . for nonlinear operators , trpmd ( like rpmd )",
    "would be expected to break down faster than for linear operators due to the error term only acting directly on the higher normal modes , though the example of the position - squared autocorrelation function given above suggests that with a careful choice of friction the breakdown may not be too drastic .",
    "although the analysis for a parabolic barrier in section  [ ssec : pb ] does not suggest that the trpmd rate will ever be closer to the matsubara ( and therefore quantum ) rate , trpmd could be computationally advisable above the crossover temperature ( where passage over the barrier is dominated by motion of the unthermostatted centroid ) since the trpmd trajectories may sample the path - integral phase space more efficiently than the rpmd trajectories @xcite , and same may be true for other observable properties which are dominated by barrier crossing , such as diffusion @xcite .",
    "the trpmd time - evolution is also simpler computationally since the same dynamics can be used for thermostatting and computation of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these results suggest that beneath the crossover temperature , trpmd is not to be advised for reaction rates , a result broadly supported by numerical tests in one - dimensional and multidimensional gas - phase systems @xcite .",
    "all the results presented here generalize immediately to multidimensional systems , where the friction is applied in @xmath124 normal modes and springs exist between @xmath77 replicas of the physical system . for nonlinear operators one can",
    "not , in general , easily relate the kubo and generalized kubo forms [ eqs .   and ]",
    "( the position - squared operator explored above being an exception ) . for reaction rates involving the highly nonlinear flux and side operators this is resolved by relating the generalized kubo form to the exact quantum expression when there is no recrossing of the path - integral dividing surface ( and those orthogonal to it in path - integral space ) by the exact quantum dynamics of the system @xcite , such that trpmd rate theory will give the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing by either the trpmd dynamics or exact quantum dynamics .",
    "in this article we have shown , for the first time , how to obtain thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics ( trpmd ) from exact quantum dynamics by a series of approximations , each with an analytic error term .",
    "we firstly discard fluctuations of the highest @xmath125 normal modes from the exact quantum time evolution , giving matsubara dynamics @xcite . to derive a computationally tractable approximation to matsubara dynamics",
    ", we perform a contour integral in the momenta ( where we assume the edge terms to be zero ) , giving a correlation function with the ( real ) ring polymer distribution , but whose liouvillian is complex .",
    "we then replace the imaginary part of the complex liouvillian with a white - noise fokker - planck term , giving trpmd .",
    "each of these approximations has its limitations and benefits .",
    "the primary consequence of discarding the fluctuations of the highest normal modes from the exact quantum dynamics ( leading to matsubara dynamics ) is neglect of interference effects and mixing of quantum states . in physical systems",
    "this is seen as the failure of trpmd to replicate the fermi resonance in the zundel cation @xcite ( cmd and rpmd also fail here @xcite , as would be expected as they too are approximations to matsubara dynamics @xcite ) .",
    "however , discarding these fluctuations leads to a classical - like dynamics which preserves the quantum boltzmann distribution .",
    "we then show that a careful choice of the friction matrix ( which is system independent and known in advance ) will cause all ring polymer normal modes to oscillate at the correct frequency in a harmonic potential , and therefore will reproduce the correct frequency of oscillation of the position - squared autocorrelation function and the correct @xmath59 value ; neither cmd nor rpmd will replicate both of these properties .",
    "however , the oscillations amplitude is too small , and we suspect that a generalized langevin equation @xcite may be more successful than a simple white noise thermostat , in that it may be constructed to produce the correct frequency of oscillation of the higher normal modes but with smaller damping ( and maybe even the correct maxima in the position and momentum autocorrelation spectra ) . the same analysis , but for a parabolic barrier , shows that no physical friction parameter will solve the qualitative innacurracies in the higher ring polymer normal mode fluctuations .",
    "usage of unphysical negative friction @xcite as a possible solution to this problem is left as further work .",
    "future research could also include extension to non - adiabatic systems where rpmd has been successful .",
    "@xcite    in closing , the results presented here give an _ a priori _ prescription for when to use trpmd : it should be used for computation of spectra and other properties of bound systems where the correct oscillation frequencies are required , and avoided for rate calculation beneath the crossover temperature .",
