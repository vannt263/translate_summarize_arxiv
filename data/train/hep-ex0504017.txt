    "the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a particle simultaneously violates two discrete symmetries : parity ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) . by the virtue of the cpt - theorem ,",
    "the t - violation would imply cp - violation  @xcite .",
    "while no edms have been found so far , most supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of elementary particles predict electron edms , @xmath7 , that are within a reach of planned and on - going experimental searches . here",
    "we investigate a related t - odd , p - odd quantity  cp - violating polarizability , @xmath0 , introduced recently by @xcite . for",
    "a diamagnetic atom , a non - vanishing @xmath0 could provide an unambiguous signature of the electron edm or other cp - violating mechanisms . here",
    "we relate @xmath0 to @xmath7 via _ ab initio _ relativistic calculations for closed - shell atoms .",
    "we also relate @xmath0 to the scalar constant of the cp - odd electron - nucleus interaction .",
    "an interaction of an atom with external dc electric field in the presence of the electron edm causes spin polarization in the direction of the field @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to measure corresponding magnetization of the ferromagnetic crystal was made by vasiliev and kolycheva in 1978 @xcite . according to @xcite , modern techniques allow to improve that old measurement by many orders of magnitude and reach the sensitivity , which allows to improve present limit on the electron edm @xcite : @xmath8 first results of the new generation of experiments with ferromagnetic solids were recently reported by @xcite .",
    "characteristic feature of the experiments with macroscopic magnetization is the dependence of the signal on the density of atoms .",
    "that gives a huge enhancement in sensitivity for a condensed phase sample .",
    "it is generally assumed that diamagnetic atoms are not useful for the search of the electron edm .",
    "however , baryshevsky has recently pointed out  @xcite that cp - violating magnetization would also exists for a diamagnetic atom . for a spherically - symmetric atom , the e - field - induced magnetic moment @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of cp - violating polarizability @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the strength of the electric field .",
    "this observation opens new experimental possibilities .",
    "for example , one can measure magnetization of liquid xenon in a strong external electric field .",
    "the advantage of the experiment with diamagnetic liquid in comparison to ferromagnetic solids is a much lower magnetic noise .    for a diamagnetic ( closed - shell ) atom the magnetization ( [ i1 ] ) appears in the higher orders of the perturbation theory than for the open - shell atoms . in this paper",
    "we calculate polarizability @xmath10 for rare - gas atoms he through rn using third - order perturbation theory and dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) formalism .",
    "further , we evaluate a feasibility of setting a limit on electron edm by measuring cp - violating magnetization of liquid xe ( lxe ) .",
    "we consider the effect of the environment on @xmath10 of xe atoms in lxe .",
    "we use a simple cell model of an atom confined in a spherically - symmetric cavity  @xcite . in a non - polar liquid",
    ", such a cavity roughly approximates an averaged interaction with the neighboring atoms .",
    "we solve the dhf equations with proper boundary conditions at the cavity radius . for lxe , we find that compared to the cp - odd polarizability of an isolated atom , the resulting cp - odd polarizability of an atom of lxe is suppressed by about 65% .",
    "we find that the cp - violating polarizability exhibits an unusually strong dependence on the nuclear charge @xmath4 .",
    "previously , sandars @xcite has shown that an atomic enhancement factor for the electron edm is of the order of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fine structure constant .",
    "as we demonstrate below , for a diamagnetic atom , the polarizability @xmath10 vanishes in the non - relativistic approximation . because of that it is suppressed by a factor of @xmath15 . with the sandars enhancement factor this leads to a steep , @xmath16 , scaling of the effect .",
    "recently there was a renewed interest to the cp - odd weak neutral current interactions of electrons with nucleons @xcite .",
    "it is known that in atomic experiments the electron edm is indistinguishable from the scalar cp - odd weak neutral currents @xcite . any new limit on the electron edm from the atomic experiments",
    "will also lead to the improved limit on the scalar constant of the cp - odd electron - nuclear interaction . here",
    "we relate computed @xmath0 to the scalar constant of the cp - odd electron - nucleus interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : formalism ] we derive the third - order expression for the cp - violating polarizability and use the independent - particle approximation to simplify the atomic many - body expressions . in section  [ sec : results ] we present results of our dhf calculations of @xmath10 for rare - gas atoms and derive the @xmath4-scaling of @xmath10 . in section  [ sec : lxe ]",
    "we evaluate a feasibility of setting a limit on electron edm by measuring cp - violating magnetization of liquid xe .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we draw conclusions . unless specified otherwise , atomic units @xmath17 and gaussian system for electro - magnetic equations are used throughout . in these units ,",
    "the bohr magneton is @xmath18 and the unit of magnetic field is @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we derive the expression for cp - violating polarizability within the third - order perturbation theory .",
    "further , we simplify the derived expression using the dirac - hartree - fock approximation for atomic many - body states .    the problem to be solved",
    "can be formulated as follows : what is the induced magnetic moment @xmath20 of an atom perturbed by an external electric field @xmath12 ?",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that if the atomic wavefunctions are the eigenstates of the parity and time - reversal operators , the induced magnetic moment vanishes .",
    "however , in the presence of the cp - odd interactions , @xmath21 , there appears a tiny e - field - induced magnetic moment . to emphasize the essential role of cp - violation in the generation of the magnetic - moment",
    ", we will use cp superscript with the magnetic moment , @xmath22 .",
    "the interaction @xmath21 can be due to electron edm or cp - odd weak neutral currents , and we will specify the particular forms of @xmath21 in section  [ sec : mels ] . for a spherically - symmetric system , the induced magnetic moment will be directed along the applied e - field .",
    "we develop the perturbative expansion for the atomic wavefunction @xmath23 in terms of the combined interaction @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the interaction with the external electric field applied along the @xmath26-axis , @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the z - component of the electric dipole moment operator . to estimate the dominant contribution to @xmath29 , it is sufficient to truncate the perturbative expansion for the atomic wavefunction at the second order in @xmath30 , @xmath31",
    ". then the expectation value of the magnetic moment reads @xmath32 to arrive at the above expression we used a simplifying fact that the magnetic moment is a p - even operator , while both @xmath33 and @xmath34 have parities opposite to the one of the first - order correction @xmath35 .",
    "the textbook expressions for the first and second - order corrections to wavefunctions can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . with these expressions , @xmath36 in these formulas ,",
    "the summations are carried out over the eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the derived third - order expression can be presented in a more compact and symmetrical form using the resolvent operator @xmath39 , @xmath40 the three above contributions differ by permutations of the operators @xmath41 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "having derived a general third - order expression for the induced magnetic moment , eq .",
    "( [ eq : muresolvent ] ) , here we proceed with the atomic - structure part of the evaluation .",
    "we employ the conventional hartree - fock ( hf ) or independent - particle approximation for that purpose . in this approach ,",
    "the atomic many - body wavefunction is represented by the slater determinant composed of single - particle orbitals .",
    "these orbitals are determined from a set of the hf equations .",
    "using a complete set of slater determinants , the contributions to the induced magnetic moment , eq.([eq : mubreakpt1][eq : mubreakpt3 ] ) , may be expressed as @xmath42 here indexes @xmath43 and @xmath44 run over single - particle orbitals occupied in @xmath45 , indexes @xmath46 and @xmath47 run over virtual orbitals , and @xmath48 are the energies of the hf orbitals .",
    "it is well known that the relativistic effects are essential for the non - vanishing contributions to energy levels due to edms ( schiff theorem ) . moreover , in section  [ sec : z5scaling ] , we will demonstrate that the relativism enters into the calculations of cp - violating polarizability in the enhanced fashion : one also needs to incorporate relativistic corrections to electric- and magnetic - dipole matrix elements and energies entering eq.([eq : mubreakpt1][eq : mubreakpt3 ] ) .",
    "we include the relativistic effects by directly solving dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) equations @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a potential of the coulomb interaction with a finite - size nucleus and @xmath51 is non - local self - consistent dhf potential .",
    "we use the following ansatz for the dirac bi - spinor @xmath52{c}ip_{n\\kappa}(r)\\ \\omega_{\\kappa m}(\\hat{r})\\\\ q_{n\\kappa}(r)\\ \\omega_{-\\kappa m}(\\hat{r } ) \\end{array}\\ , \\right ) \\ ,",

    "in particular , the reduced matrix elements of the magnetic - dipole and electric - dipole moment operators between two bi - spinors are given by @xmath57 @xmath58 being normalized spherical harmonic .",
    "at this point we would like to specify particular forms for the cp - odd interaction @xmath21 .",
    "we will distinguish between the electron edm coupling @xmath59 and weak neutral - current ( nc ) interactions @xmath60 .",
    "the edm interaction of an electron with an electric field @xmath61 can be written in four - component dirac notation as  @xcite : @xmath62 the matrix element of this interaction is given by @xmath63 where we assumed that the dominant contribution is accumulated close to the nucleus ( of charge @xmath4 ) so that @xmath61 can be approximated by the nuclear field . the selection rules with respect to angular quantum numbers @xmath46 and @xmath64 arise because @xmath21 is a pseudoscalar .",
    "recently there was a renewed interest to cp - odd weak neutral current interactions of electrons with nucleons @xcite .",
