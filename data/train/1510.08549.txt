    "the deviations from mean - field theory caused by fluctuations have been the object of considerable research @xcite .",
    "thus , when reactants diffuse and react on contact , they create spatial correlations which invalidate the usual concept of mean - field theory , and indeed , invalidate the applicability of rate equations , which are normally viewed as fundamental in chemical kinetics .",
    "a very simple example of this is one - species annihilation ( or aggregation ) in which one species reacts with itself via a bimolecular reaction @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents an inert species , which we disregard in the following .",
    "the rate equation for such a process is given by @xmath5 and the decay for large times is therefore @xmath6 .",
    "however , as is well - known , see for example @xcite , if we consider a model of point random walkers on the line , which annihilate whenever two walkers alight on the same site , then the decay is in fact given by @xmath7 . at a deeper level , the amplitude of the @xmath6 decay determined by ( [ eq:2new ] ) depends on the initial concentration , whereas the amplitude of the @xmath8 decay does not .",
    "these , and many similar results have been discussed extensively . for a review ,",
    "see for example the book @xcite by redner and krapivsky . in the following",
    ", we shall consider a variation on the model described by ( [ eq:1new ] ) , in which the transport has both a ballistic component , in which the particles can have one of two velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and a diffusive component .",
    "the purely ballistic model was initially discussed by elskens and frisch in @xcite .",
    "similarly to the diffusive model discussed in @xcite , the decay of concentration goes as @xmath11 , but for quite different reasons . as was then pointed out in @xcite",
    ", combining both diffusion and ballistic motion leads , in one dimension , to a decay that is more rapid than the one brought about by either mechanism .",
    "the kinetics of particle annihilation , @xmath12 has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community from another completely different point of view .",
    "the dynamics of particle annihilation with @xmath12 , have a direct one to one correspondence with the kinetic ising model in one dimension .",
    "for example , the zero temperature glauber dynamics in one dimensional ising spin system with nearest neighbour interaction can be mapped to the @xmath12 system where the @xmath13 are pure random walkers @xcite . on the other hand , the binary opinion dynamic models in one dimension ( which can be directly mapped to one dimensional ising spin system ) ,",
    "have a much more complicated walker picture , where the @xmath13 walkers are not purely random .",
    "there are also binary opinion dynamic models , where @xmath13 walkers perform a complicated ballistic motion .",
    "for example , in the dynamics , introduced in @xcite , the boundaries of the domains ( which could be construed as walkers ) move ballistically unless they meet the boundary of some other domain .",
    "once two boundaries meet , the annihilation of the boundaries is more involved than the simple @xmath14 . in another example of a binary opinion dynamics model introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the walkers in the corresponding walker picture have ballistic motion , in this case , the @xmath13 walkers always move ballistically in the direction of their nearest walker and annihilate upon meeting , following @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to complex changes in the direction of motion of the walkers , somewhat akin to a random walk @xcite . understanding the dynamics of simple ballistic annihilation process with superimposed diffusion",
    "can thus also be of help in understanding these complex dynamics .",
    "the simple model of ballistic annihilation discussed in this paper has a quite rich structure .",
    "introducing a corresponding binary opinion dynamics model could be a motivation and direction for the future work .",
    "here we study the model of ballistic annihilation with superimposed diffusion in greater detail than was previously done , showing in particular a remarkably rich structure when the number of left- and right - going particles is allowed to be different .",
    "in particular , we study the nature of the crossovers appearing as these numbers come close to each other .",
    "let us first describe in some detail the model we study in this paper .",
    "the system we consider consists of point particles on a one dimensional lattice .",
    "each particle moves , always , either to the left or to the right , that is , each particle has positive or negative velocity . initially there is a fraction ( @xmath15 ) of particles with positive velocity and @xmath16 of particles with negative velocity ( with @xmath17 ) randomly distributed on the lattice .",
    "whenever a particle lands on a site in which another particle is found , both are removed from the system .",
    "this is therefore a model of the so - called one species annihilation type ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it is of central importance that the particles are moved asynchronously , that is , at each time step , one particle is chosen at random and moved in the direction corresponding to the velocity of that particle .",
    "note that the asynchronous updating rule leads to the possibility that particles having the same velocity can react , since the random choice of the particle leads to an effective diffusive motion of the particles with respect to their neighbouring particles having the same speed , whereas in a perfectly synchronous update , these particles distances would remain fixed .",
    "it is largely the consequences of this effect we shall explore in this paper .",
    "this model is equivalent to a model in which a fraction @xmath0 of particles perform a random walk with bias @xmath9 , whereas the others have a bias @xmath10 .",
    "we shall generally work with a bias equal to @xmath9 in order to keep dimensions explicit .",
    "for @xmath18 , the number of positive and negative velocity particles are equal , on average , at the beginning .",
    "taking @xmath19 introduces inequality in the numbers of positive and negative velocity particles , and @xmath20 means there is only one kind of particles .    the synchronous update version of this system has been studied by elskens and frisch @xcite , who showed that for @xmath21 , the concentration of particles decays as @xmath11 . here",
    "we study the following variant : instead of letting the particles move ballistically in continuous time , we discretize time and choose , at each time step , a particle at random and move it to the right if it has positive velocity , and to the left otherwise .",
    "in other words , we use an asynchronous updating rather than a synchronous one .",
    "this introduces a diffusion , and thereby the possibility for two particles having the same velocity to annihilate with each other .",
    "this apparently minor change affects the system profoundly , as already noted by @xcite in the case @xmath21 .",
    "here we extend the study to the general case , and also display some non - trivial large time behaviour in the case @xmath21 which had previously gone unreported .",
    "finally , we propose a mechanism , first studied by alemany @xcite , for modifying the decay exponent of diffusive annihilation kinetics in one dimension , and show that it is indeed operative in this particular system .",
    "let us briefly summarize our results for the general case @xmath22 .",
    "we find three different regimes , of which the easiest is certainly the last : at very large times , all particles with negative velocities have disappeared .",
    "additionally , all the spatial correlations their presence might have induced  we shall see that such correlations can in fact arise  have also disappeared .",
    "we thus have a system consisting solely of right - moving particles moving ballistically , with a superimposed diffusion .",
    "this is equivalent to pure diffusive dynamics , so that the asymptotic decay goes as @xmath7 .",
    "this is the third stage of the system s evolution . if @xmath23 , there are two other stages : the first one is the one in which we may neglect the difference in concentration between left- and right - going particles . in this regime ,",
    "the usual decay exponent reported and analysed by ben - naim , redner and krapivsky @xcite applies and the concentration decays as @xmath24 .",
    "this stage ends when all left - going particles have disappeared .",
    "this happens , as we shall see , at a time @xmath25 of order @xmath26 [ fig [ sch_cross ] ] . at this point , a second stage sets in , characterised by a decay with @xmath27 leading term [ fig [ sch_cross ] ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the surviving right going particles are far from being uniformly distributed , which leads to an anomalous decay , as pointed out by alemany @xcite .",
    "the third stage , when these correlations finally disappear , sets in at a time @xmath28 that scales as @xmath29 [ fig [ sch_cross ] ] .    ,",
    "the concentration of total number of particles at time @xmath30 .",
    ", width=188 ]    if we start with @xmath31 particles , then one finds that at @xmath25 there remain @xmath32 particles , whereas at @xmath28 there only remain @xmath33 .",
    "this brings out some numerically challenging features of the model : if we wish to have a clean separation of time scales , we need at least @xmath34 , and if we wish to have , say , a hundred particles at @xmath28 ( in order to be able to observe the final exponent reliably ) , we would need to start out with @xmath35 , which is altogether unrealistic .",
    "we shall therefore rely on various simulations with different values of the parameters to bring out the various features of the system .",
    "we have studied the following quantities in the present work .",
    "1 .   decay of the concentration of total number particles @xmath36 with time , starting from concentration @xmath37 , which means that all sites are occupied initially .",
    "decay of the concentration of excess number of particles @xmath38 with time , which is defined as the absolute difference between positive and negative velocity particles . for @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( up to an @xmath41 factor ) where @xmath31 is the initial number of particles .",
    "3 .   change of the domain size of positive and negative velocity particles with time .",
    "the distribution of inter - particle distances between two neighbouring particles ( independent of their velocities ) at late time .",
    "this distribution is also studied for same velocity particles and different velocity particles .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath42 : this is the probability that a site remains unvisited by any of the walkers @xmath13 up to time @xmath43 .",
    "when the walkers perform pure random walk , the persistence probability @xmath42 shows a power law decay given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the persistence exponent and is unrelated to any other known static or dynamic exponents @xcite .",
    "we have studied the dynamics starting from initially @xmath31 particles , with @xmath46 .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath47 to @xmath48 configurations .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used .",
    "for @xmath49 only one kind of ballistic particles ( either @xmath50 or @xmath10 velocity particles ) exist in the system . due to the random update rule for the simulation , by which diffusion is incorporated ,",
    "the relative motion of the particles is actually diffusive in this case .",
    "the relative diffusion constant @xmath51 is the same as if the particles performed symmetric random walks ( see appendix [ diffconst ] for details ) .",
    "naturally , in this situation , the concentration @xmath36 will decay as @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath52 , for any typical configuration , the number of @xmath50 and @xmath10 velocity particles will not be equal ( this is clear for @xmath53 , but also when @xmath54 , due to statistical fluctuations ) . due to this inequality in numbers ,",
    "the system will go from a regime of ballistic annihilation with superimposed diffusion , to a long time regime of pure diffusion when only one kind of particle is present . in the following ,",
    "we start by considering the regime in which no significant difference in the numbers of left- and right - going particles exists @xmath55 . in this case , as has been shown in @xcite , the particle number decays as @xmath24 . in the following subsection , we shall re - derive this result for the sake of keeping the paper self - contained . afterwards",
    ", we proceed to analyse the case of finite systems , in which the particles eventually all have one given velocity due to the effect of statistical fluctuations .",
    "finally we analyse the case of @xmath1 .      in the following ,",
    "we analyze the system for @xmath21 using dimensional considerations .",
    "the various parameters involved are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath30 and @xmath9 .",
    "these can be combined in two dimensionless parameters :    @xmath58    [ eq : dimless ]    the former is the ratio of the time required for nearest neighbours to cross the average distance between them if they move ballistically , to the time required to cross the same distance with diffusive dynamics .",
    "it thus states whether diffusion or drift dominates the short - time dynamics .",
    "@xmath59 is a dimensionless time , which separates the regime in which diffusion dominates , @xmath60 , from that in which drift dominates , @xmath61    the concentration of particles at time @xmath30 can thus be written in terms of the adimensional quantities @xmath62 and @xmath59 as follows : @xmath63    if @xmath64 , then @xmath36 should not depend on @xmath9 for initial times , since the process is ( in a first approximation ) purely diffusive , leading to a @xmath7 behaviour . therefore , for @xmath64",
    ", using the expression of @xmath62 and @xmath59 , given by equation ( [ eq : dimlessa ] ) and ( [ eq : dimlessb ] ) we get @xmath65 this is only valid up to @xmath66 , since , as we have seen above , this is the crossover time between drift and diffusion .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath67 , the behaviour of @xmath36 is purely ballistic for moderate @xmath59 .",
    "it is thus independent of @xmath57 and given by @xmath68 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath67 , again using the equations ( [ eq : dimlessa ] ) and([eq : dimlessb ] ) we find @xmath69 let us now determine the time @xmath59 up to which this is valid .",
    "the qualitatively new feature introduced by diffusion is the possibility for particles of the same velocity to annihilate via diffusion . but",
    "this happens on a time scale @xmath70 , which , in terms of the adimensional quantities , is @xmath71 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the approximation ( [ strongbias ] ) should hold up to @xmath71    the previous equations ( [ weakbias ] ) and ( [ strongbias ] ) only hold for short times . for the former ,",
    "this is because the influence of drift is eventually felt , whereas for the latter , it is due to the diffusive annihilation of particles with like velocity .",
    "if we now describe the large @xmath59 behaviour for the full dynamics , by @xmath72 then we obtain two conditions on @xmath73 and @xmath74 as follows : when @xmath75 and @xmath64 , we may apply both ( [ weakbias ] ) and ( [ asympt ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath76 implying @xmath77 . similarly ,",
    "if we consider the case in which @xmath67 and @xmath71 , we may apply ( [ strongbias ] ) as well as ( [ asympt ] ) , and are thereby led to @xmath78 from which follows @xmath79    we thus obtain @xmath80 this finally yields , for the concentration @xmath36 at large times : @xmath81 this dimensional analysis parallels that made in @xcite and is presented for the sake of keeping the paper self - contained .",
    "note that the above derivation contains a weak point : it is assumed in ( [ asympt ] ) that the @xmath62 dependence of the prefactor of @xmath82 is always the same power @xmath73 , both in the @xmath64 and in the @xmath67 regime .",
    "this is , in itself , not obvious , and we shall see in later sections a derivation of the same result , free from this objectionable feature .",
    "let us first describe the behaviour of the set of surviving particles in ballistic annihilation with synchronous updating .",
    "here we follow @xcite .",
    "let the initial condition of a system undergoing ballistic annihilation be given by the numbers @xmath83 , where @xmath84 runs from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , where @xmath86 is the length of the system , and @xmath83 can take three possible values : @xmath87 means that site @xmath84 is initially occupied by a particle having velocity @xmath83 , whereas @xmath88 means that site @xmath84 is initially unoccupied .",
    "assume the @xmath89 represent the @xmath50 velocity particles and the @xmath90 represent the @xmath10 velocity particles .",
    "under these circumstances , once the initial condition is set , something we shall assume to have been done at random , then the fate of each particle is uniquely determined .",
    "indeed , each particle has a unique annihilation partner , or else survives indefinitely .",
    "if @xmath89 , the unique annihilation partner is initially at position @xmath91 , defined by the following condition : let @xmath92 be defined as the following set : @xmath93 then @xmath91 is the smallest element of @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath94 , then the particle initially at @xmath84 survives indefinitely and @xmath95 ( a wholly similar definition works if @xmath90 , in which case we would say the partner is at initial position @xmath96 ) .    given the initial condition , each particle survives until it encounters its reaction partner .",
    "the collision time is thus @xmath97 where we have considered the positive velocity particles .",
    "we now determine the structure of the set @xmath98 defined as @xmath99 let us consider a pair of particles with positive velocity separated by a distance @xmath84 .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that we have two particles , one at @xmath85 and one at @xmath100 .",
    "the particle at @xmath84 we call the _ leader _ , the one at zero , the _",
    "follower_. for both to belong to @xmath98 , the following conditions are necessary :    1 .",
    "@xmath101 should not have any element @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath92 should not have any element @xmath103    if @xmath104 , then the two intervals @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 $ ] are disjoint .",
    "the probability of both sites belonging to @xmath98 is thus simply the product of either site belonging to @xmath98 and no dependence on @xmath84 exists .",
    "note that this is so whether or not @xmath21 in the initial condition .",
    "let us now consider the opposite case . in this case ,",
    "the leader `` clears the way '' for the follower : since @xmath92 has no element @xmath103 , it follows that @xmath101 can not contain any elements in the interval @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "thus , for the follower to belong to @xmath98 , it is sufficient that there be no elements in @xmath101 belonging to the interval @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "the probabilities that the leader and the follower both belong to @xmath98 are thus again a product , but this time of the probability that for all @xmath108 we have @xmath109 in other words , this is the probability @xmath110 that a random walk , which starts at the origin and takes a step to the right does not return to the origin before time @xmath84 .",
    "the probability for this , as is well known @xcite , scales as @xmath111 for @xmath112 , if the walk is symmetric , which corresponds , in our case , to an initial condition with @xmath21 .",
    "thus , if @xmath21 , the probability of having two particles separated by a distance @xmath113 both surviving a time @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath111 . in other words , this description is compatible with the set @xmath98 forming a fractal set  below the cutoff value @xmath30with fractal dimension @xmath114 .",
    "the correlation function for @xmath112 and @xmath115 but @xmath113 is of order @xmath116 .     particles .",
    "note that the number of final particles is quite small  namely six  in order to claim that these lie on a fractal .",
    "we may nevertheless view this as evidence for the fact that , in the limit of infinitely many initial particles , the surviving particles would indeed lie on a fractal.,width=325 ]    the initial and very late time positions of the surviving particles as shown the schematic figure [ frac_p ] , form a number of clusters ( of two or more particles ) and the clusters are well separated from each other .",
    "this indicates that the long surviving particles are on a fractal from the beginning .    in the case with no diffusion",
    ", we therefore see that @xmath98 is a fractal with lower cutoff at length @xmath117 ( lattice spacing ) and at upper cutoff @xmath30 with fractal dimension @xmath114 .",
    "this was the case in which we have synchronous updating .",
    "if instead we have asynchronous dynamics , the annihilation of similar particles eliminates all particles with a distance less than @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding set of surviving particles then becomes a fractal of dimension @xmath114 with lower cutoff @xmath118 and upper cutoff @xmath30 , leading to the fact that the set has @xmath119 elements in each domain of size @xmath30 , thereby leading to a concentration @xmath36 of @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore see that the particles surviving at the time @xmath120 , at which only one species survives , also lie on a fractal of dimension @xmath121 .",
    "the fact that @xmath122 is a fractal further implies , as shown by alemany @xcite , that the decay of a purely diffusive reaction starting from such an initial condition is not given by @xmath11 , but by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the fractal dimension of the initial condition . in the particular case which concerns us here , since @xmath121 , we have a decay law of @xmath27 .",
    "this is seen in qualitative terms as follows : the probability that a given particle survives for a time @xmath30 is negligible , if this particle is both followed and preceded by a particle significantly closer than @xmath125 .",
    "we therefore require , for the particle to survive , that one of either neighbours be further from the central particle than @xmath125 , which has the probability @xmath126 . in our case",
    ", this means that the final decay , after the annihilation of all minority particles , goes as @xmath27 .",
    "let us look at this decay law in greater detail .",
    "when the particles are distributed on a fractal of dimension @xmath124 ( @xmath127 ) , the probability distribution function for initial inter - particle distances for two nearest particles will be @xmath128 , @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "the mean distance between nearest - neighbour particles , diverges for @xmath131 or for @xmath132 .",
    "we have obtained the decay law considering this discrete distribution given by equation ( [ indist ] ) , following the formalism developed by alemany @xcite .",
    "the number of particles @xmath133 at time @xmath30 ( normalised by initial number of particles @xmath134 ) will be      where @xmath136 .",
    "see appendix [ fractal ] for details .",
    "for the fractal dimension @xmath121 , that is @xmath137 , the leading term will be @xmath27 and the coefficient of this leading term is positive , as @xmath138 is _ negative _ for all @xmath139 . the first correction to scaling will involve both the second and the third term of ( [ nwfrct ] ) , thereby leading to    @xmath140    in the following",
    ", we shall always take the leading correction to scaling into account , since it considerably modifies the behaviour .",
    "let us now analyse the case in which @xmath22 .",
    "we proceed exactly as in the previous subsection , and we wish to know the structure of the set @xmath98 .",
    "the probability that a particle at @xmath85 and another particle at @xmath84 both belong to @xmath98 , in the case @xmath113 , is still given by the probability , which we now call @xmath141 , that a random walk , which starts at the origin and takes a step to the right , does not return to the origin before time @xmath84 .",
    "the important difference is now that the walk is biased , that is , that a step to the right now has probability @xmath0 , whereas a step to the left has probability @xmath142 .",
    "the probability @xmath141 has the property that it _ saturates _ to a positive value @xmath143 as @xmath144 .",
    "more specifically , this saturation happens when @xmath145 , where @xmath146 as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 we have @xmath147 .",
    "the set @xmath98 is therefore a fractal set with a cutoff which is either at @xmath30 or at @xmath26 , depending on which is smaller .",
    "the correlation function in this case is @xmath116 for @xmath148 , whereas it goes as @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "of course , @xmath151 and @xmath113 are only compatible if @xmath152 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath153 , that is , if we are looking at the number of surviving particles of the _ minority _ species , then the probability of surviving for @xmath84 time steps decays exponentially in @xmath84 as @xmath84 becomes larger than a characteristic value @xmath154 .",
    "this means that there are essentially no minority particles when @xmath155 , in other words , after a time of order @xmath26 .",
    "we shall call this time @xmath25 .",
    "we will again obtain this time scale from the scaling at the crossover point at the end of this section , with the implication that the relatively few particles that survive at such times are very close to each other .    when all minority particles have annihilated , and only the majority species remains , the surviving particles lie on a fractal of dimension @xmath114 with a lower cutoff @xmath156 and an upper cutoff @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the time at which the minority species disappears . at that time , one has @xmath157 particles , where @xmath158 is the initial number of majority particles .",
    "these particles will now undergo diffusive annihilation with diffusion constant @xmath159 ( appendix [ diffconst ] ) , starting from a fractal distribution .",
    "actually , not only these remaining majority particles , but all excess particles @xmath38 will undergo diffusive annihilation on a fractal of fractal dimension @xmath114 from the beginning , except when @xmath160 in which case all particles are excess particles .",
    "let us determine the crossover time @xmath25 .",
    "this is the time at which we cross from the @xmath24 initial behaviour , to the long - time @xmath27 behaviour .",
    "the latter , as follows from the above ,    @xmath161    where the coefficient @xmath162 does not depend on @xmath163 , as the decay at the beginning does not depend on the initial concentration . on the other hand , @xmath164 , as @xmath147 for @xmath165 .",
    "simplifying equation ( [ scrvr ] ) , we get @xmath166 which is compatible with the previous description . for @xmath2 ,",
    "this crossover time @xmath167 will diverge and hence will scale with system size @xmath86 for finite @xmath86 .    for @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath27 decay is difficult to see , as there remain very few particles at this late stage .",
    "for @xmath168 , it is respectively easier to detect the @xmath27 ( which is the leading term ) decay of concentration on the fractal , because there remain more particles in this situation .",
    "as the dynamics is diffusive in this regime , the fractal structure will eventually fade out to the uniform distribution .",
    "hence there will be yet another crossover and the concentration will decay as @xmath11 at very late time . if the crossover time for this second crossover is @xmath28 we can write @xmath169 where the coefficient @xmath170 does not depend on the initial concentration and hence on @xmath163 .",
    "this gives @xmath171 to detect and measure this second crossover time @xmath28 is quite difficult , as the number of remaining particles is very low and the time very large . to be able to observe it , we need to use comparatively large values of @xmath163 , for which other effects , such as the @xmath172 initial decay , are not so clearly visible .",
    "for @xmath173 , there exists only one kind of particles ( either @xmath50 or @xmath10 velocity particles ) and hence the excess number of particles @xmath174 . as discussed above ,",
    "the system is purely diffusive in this case and , thus , the concentration @xmath36 decays with time @xmath30 as @xmath11 ( fig . [ nwpc1 ] ) .     for the total number of particles decay as @xmath11.,width=226 ]",
    "the domain size of positive or negative velocity particles ( depending on @xmath175 or @xmath176 ) can not change and is equal to the system size from the beginning .",
    "the probability distribution of inter - particle distances between two neighbouring particles , increases linearly with the domain size ( due to diffusion ) for smaller domains @xcite and then drops exponentially , as expected for diffusion .",
    "the persistence probability decays exponentially with time as the walkers are ballistic and wipe out the persistence of all the lattice sites .",
    "when @xmath54 the number of particles of each kind is equal on average .",

    "this is due to the presence of more particles of one velocity than of the other ; the majority particles wipe out the persistence of all the sites very quickly .",
    "to summarise , we have considered the model of annihilating particles moving ballistically with a superimposed diffusion .",

    "a second crossover to an ordinary @xmath11 decay , characteristic of ordinary diffusion - limited annihilation in one - dimension , is observed at a crossover time @xmath256 .",

    "when all the particles are of same velocity ( say @xmath50 ) , the only source of diffusion is the random update rule .",
