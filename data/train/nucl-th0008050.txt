    "suppression of charmonium production in high energy heavy ion collisions is a possible signature for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recent data from the pb+pb collision at @xmath5 gev@xmath6 in the na50 experiment at cern @xcite have shown an anomalously large @xmath0 suppression in high @xmath7 events . while there are suggestions that this anomalous suppression may be due to the formation of the qgp @xcite , more conventional mechanisms based on @xmath0 absorption by comoving hadrons",
    "have also been proposed as a possible explanation @xcite .",
    "since the latter scenario depends on the value of @xmath0 absorption cross sections by hadrons , it is important to have better knowledge of these cross sections in order to understand the observed anomalous charmonium suppression @xcite . even in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , where the qgp is most likely to be formed ,",
    "the effect of hadronic absorption of @xmath0 is still non - negligible @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one needs to know if @xmath0 can also be produced from the hot hadronic matter in the later stage of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "also , charm mesons such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are expected to be abundantly produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies and beyond .",
    "it has been shown that the high mass ( @xmath8 gev ) dilepton spectrum at rhic may be dominated by decays from charm and bottom hadrons @xcite .",
    "since charm quarks may lose appreciable energies in a quark - gluon plasma via gluon radiations , study of charm meson spectrum in heavy ion collisions could provide useful information on the properties of the qgp @xcite .",
    "however , charm mesons may interact strongly with hadrons during later stage of heavy ion collisions , leading to possible changes in their final spectra . as a result ,",
    "the dilepton spectrum from the decay of charm meson pairs could also be modified @xcite . to study the energy loss of charm quarks in the qgp",
    "thus requires the understanding of charm meson interactions in hadronic matter .",
    "various approaches have been used in evaluating the charmonium absorption cross sections by hadrons . in the quark - exchange model ,",
    "an earlier study @xcite has shown that the @xmath0 absorption cross section by pion , @xmath9 , has a peak value of about @xmath10 mb at @xmath11 gev , but a recent study @xcite gives a peak value of only @xmath12 mb at the same @xmath13 region .",
    "on the other hand , the perturbative qcd approach @xcite predicts that the @xmath0 dissociation cross section increases monotonously with @xmath13 and has a value of only about @xmath14 mb around @xmath15 gev .",
    "charmonium absorption cross sections by hadrons have also been studied in meson - exchange models based on effective hadronic lagrangians .",
    "using pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector - meson ( ppv ) couplings and without form factors at the interaction vertices , matinyan and mller @xcite have found @xmath16 mb at @xmath17 gev . in a recent study ,",
    "haglin @xcite has included also the three - vector - meson ( vvv ) and four - point couplings ( or contact terms ) , and obtained much larger values for the @xmath0 absorption cross sections .",
    "large discrepancies in the magnitude of @xmath9 ( as well as @xmath18 ) thus exist among the predictions from these three approaches . in this study",
    ", we use a meson - exchange model as in @xcite but treat differently the vvv and four - point couplings in the effective lagrangian . for charm",
    "meson scattering cross sections with pion and rho meson , previous studies from the meson - exchange model include only the ppv interactions @xcite .",
    "we now also use the extended hadronic lagrangian to study these cross sections .",
    "the free lagrangian for pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the limit of su(4 ) invariance can be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote , respectively , the @xmath23 pseudoscalar and vector meson matrices in su(4 ) @xcite . to obtain the couplings between pseudoscalar and vector mesons",
    ", we introduce the minimal substitution @xmath24,~ f_{\\mu \\nu } \\rightarrow   \\partial_\\mu v_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu v_\\mu -\\frac{ig}{2 }   \\left [ v_\\mu , v_\\nu \\right ] .\\ ] ] the effective lagrangian is then given by @xmath25 \\right )   -\\frac{g^2}{4 } { \\rm tr }   \\left ( \\left [ p , v_\\mu \\right ] ^2 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ig { \\rm tr } \\left ( \\partial^\\mu v^\\nu \\left [ v_\\mu , v_\\nu \\right ]   \\right )   + \\frac{g^2}{8 } { \\rm tr } \\left ( \\left [ v_\\mu , v_\\nu \\right ] ^2 \\right ) ~. \\label{lagn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the su(4 ) symmetry is explicitly broken by hadron masses , terms involving hadron masses are added to eq.([lagn2 ] ) using the experimentally determined values .    the effective lagrangian in eq . ( [ lagn2 ] )",
    "is generated by minimal substitution , which is equivalent to treating vector mesons as gauge particles .",
    "the gauge invariance leads to the current conservation ; i.e. , in the limit of zero vector meson masses , degenerate pseudoscalar meson masses , and su(4 ) invariant coupling constants , one has @xmath26 for any given process , where the index @xmath27 denotes the external vector meson @xmath28 .",
    "we have checked that all the amplitudes without form factors satisfy the requirement of current conservation .",
    "the above effective lagrangian allows us to study various interactions of charm mesons and @xmath0 with hadrons .",
    "these include the charm meson scattering such as @xmath29 , the charm meson production and annihilation such as @xmath30 , and the charmonium absorption and annihilation such as @xmath31 .",
    "this effective hadronic lagrangian has also been extended to su(5 ) to study @xmath32 absorption in hadronic matter @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show the results for @xmath0 absorption and charm meson scattering by pion and rho meson .",
    "for @xmath0 absorption by @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , we study the following processes : @xmath33 the full amplitudes for these processes can be found in @xcite .    from the @xmath2 decay width @xcite , the coupling constant @xmath34 is found to be @xmath35 . using the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , we determine other three - point coupling constants as @xcite @xmath36 for the four - point coupling constants , there is no empirical information , and we thus use the su(4 ) relations to determine their values as @xmath37    form factors are introduced at interaction vertices to take into account the composite nature of hadrons . unfortunately , there is no empirical information on form factors involving charmoniums and charm mesons .",
    "we thus take the form factors as the usual monopole form at the three - point @xmath38 and @xmath39 channel vertices , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a cutoff parameter , and @xmath42 is the squared three momentum transfer in the c.m .",
    "frame , given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 channel processes , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we use the same value for all cutoff parameters , i.e. , @xmath45 , and choose @xmath41 as either @xmath46 or @xmath47 gev to study the uncertainties due to form factors .",
    "we also assume that the form factor at four - point vertices is given by @xmath48 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath49 is the average value of the squared three momentum transfers in @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels , @xmath50 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the charm meson scattering cross sections and their thermal averages are shown in figure 2a and 2b , respectively .",
    "as expected , the magnitude of the cross sections decreases with decreasing cutoff parameter . for the cutoff parameters used here , the cross sections for @xmath51 and @xmath52 scattering are all roughly between 10 and 20 mb .",
    "we note that form factors only suppress modestly ( by a factor of two and less ) these total cross sections and their thermal averages .",
    "this is due to the fact that these cross sections are dominated by elastic processes , which involve small momentum transfer near the threshold .",
    "in contrast , the process @xmath53 has a large threshold , and form factors suppress its cross section by as much as a factor of 8 .",
    "in summary , we have introduced an effective hadronic lagrangian , that includes the charm mesons , to study the interactions of charmed mesons and @xmath0 in hadronic matter . in particular , we have calculated the absorption cross sections of @xmath0 and scattering cross sections of charmed mesons by @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 absorption cross sections are much larger than those in a previous study , where only pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector - meson couplings were considered .",
    "including form factors at the interaction vertices , the values for @xmath9 and @xmath18 are about @xmath10 mb and @xmath54 mb , respectively , and their thermal averages at the temperature of @xmath55 mev are roughly @xmath46 mb and @xmath47 mb , respectively .",
    "these values suggest that the absorption of @xmath0 by comoving hadrons may play an important role in @xmath0 suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we also find that the scattering cross sections of @xmath1 or @xmath2 by @xmath3 or @xmath4 mesons are all about @xmath56 mb and thus expect these scatterings to significantly modify the charm meson spectra in heavy ion collisions .",
