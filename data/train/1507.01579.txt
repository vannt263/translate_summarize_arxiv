    "3c 270.1 was observed on 7/24/2000 for 2380 s with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) with the stis spectrograph and g230l grating .",
    "the data was downloaded form mast and corrected for galactic extinction with the ccm absorption law @xcite .",
    "the absorption from the ly@xmath14 valley was de - convolved from the data using the empirical statistical methods of @xcite .",
    "an intervening lyman limit system near the quasar systemic redashift was removed with the decrement method @xcite .",
    "namely , the lyman limit system was removed by assuming a single cloud with a @xmath15 opacity and an absorption that was scaled by the decrement between the continuum and the trough depth .",
    "this was considered acceptable because the power law above the lyman limit system continues smoothly through the corrected region ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the power law between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "the top frame of figure 1 is the power law fit ( solid black line ) to the continuum .",
    "the bottom frame is a fourth order polynomial fit ( solid red line ) that provides an upper limit to the continuum in the analysis of ovi absorption in the next section .",
    "a method that allows one to convert 151 mhz flux densities , @xmath19 ( measured in jy ) , into estimates of long term time averaged jet power , @xmath0 , ( measured in ergs / s ) is given by equation ( 1 ) @xcite : @xmath201.1\\times 10^{45}\\left[x^{1+\\alpha}z^{2}f_{151}\\right]^{0.857}\\mathrm{ergs / s}\\;,\\\\ & & z \\equiv 3.31-(3.65)\\times\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left[x^{4}-0.203x^{3}+0.749x^{2 } + 0.444x+0.205\\right]^{-0.125}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath19 is the total optically thin flux density from the lobes .",
    "deviations from the overly simplified minimum energy estimates are combined into a multiplicative factor , * f * , that represents the small departures from minimum energy , geometric effects , filling factors , protonic contributions and low frequency cutoff @xcite . in @xcite , it was argued that @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , there is another isotropic estimator in which the lobe energy is primarily inertial in form @xcite : @xmath23 define the radio spectral index , @xmath14 , as @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) with @xmath25 is the maximum upper bound on @xmath0 and equation ( 2 ) is the lower bound @xmath0 that is used in the following . in this paper , we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath26=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the radio images in @xcite indicate that this is a lobe dominated quasar .",
    "therefore , one expects the 151 mhz flux density ( 14.96 jy from the nasa extragalatic database ) to be dominated by the radio lobe emission .",
    "thus , from equations ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) that @xmath29 erg / s .    since the data used here covers the peak of the sed at @xmath30 , an accurate expression , @xmath31 , can be used to estimate the accretion disk luminosity .",
    "this does not include reprocessed ir emission in distant molecular clouds @xcite . from the flux density in figure 1 , @xmath32 erg / s . combining this with the estimate of @xmath0 , above , @xmath33 .",
    "3c 270.1 is kinetically dominated in this context .",
    "the top frame of figure 2 places 3c 270.1 on the same scatter plot of @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath5 as the other quasars for which a similar data reduction was performed in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "3c 270.1 has the most powerful jet and it lies at the end of the extrapolated trend of the other powerful rlqs .",
    "figure 2 relates real time properties ( meaning concurrent with the epoch that the data was sampled in the quasar rest frame ) , @xmath1 and @xmath5 , with a long term time average property , @xmath0 .",
    "the coefficient of determination to a linear fit is 0.5927 so the scatter is modest .",
    "each data point in figure 2 is a random snapshot in time of the properties of the innermost accretion flow during the lifetime each rlq .",
    "the degree of scatter indicates that there is a baseline or fiducial configuration of the central engine in each rlq and the fluctuations over time from this configuration are usually  modest \" and large fluctuations are not typical .",
    "this concept is quantified below in order to see if there is predictive power of real time jet parameters from the data in figure 2 . to begin with , segregate the real time variables from @xmath0 by inverting the linear fit to the data in the top frame of figure 2 .",
    "this process yields a real time variable @xmath35}\\;.\\ ] ] as an alternative to a scatter plot in the @xmath34 $ ] - @xmath5 plane ( the top frame of figure 2 ) , one can also consider the data scatter in the @xmath36 $ ] - @xmath37 plane . define @xmath38 as the best fit power law estimator of @xmath39 in the new scatter plane .",
    "then @xmath40 and the coefficient of determination is 0.5937 .    in order to extract the predictive capability of equation ( 5 ) for the real time jet power ( that which is concurrent with the euv measurements ) , @xmath41 , consider the following .",
    "the euv emission and the jet launching both originate in the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the fundamental assumption of this analysis is : _ since the euv and the jet emanate from a common compact region , the correlation found in figure 2 between these powerful dynamic elements is not spurious or coincidental , but results from an actual physical connection between , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 in real time . _ in particular , the average trend in figure 2 is a direct consequence of this real time interaction , or alternatively stated equation ( 5 ) is a consequence of a more fundamental quasi - simultaneous relation @xmath44 however , this relationship can only true in an average sense due to variations from rlq to rlq , and epoch to epoch variations in both the geometry as well as the physical state of the innermost accretion flow .",

    "consider , the outlier in figure 2 , 3c 288.1 .",
    "the euv deficit is much less than expected for the value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the radio core is rather weak with a 1 ghz - 100 ghz luminosity of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the source has very little intrinsic absorption as evidenced by the flat euv spectral index , so one expects a direct line of sight to the core .",
    "this implies that it is an intrinsically weak radio core with no significant free - free absorption or doppler de - boosting .",
    "the conclusion is that 3c 288.1 is an outlier in figure 2 because the quasar is currently in a state of relatively weak radio activity .",
    "one of the most striking tends in the quasar phenomenon is that the broad absorption line prominence is anti - correlated with the radio loudness of the quasar @xcite .",
    "if one considers rlqs with extended emission on super - galactic scales ( radio lobes ) this anti - correlation is stronger .",
    "only a handful of balqso candidates with extended radio emission have ever been found even in deep surveys @xcite .",
    "considering the large jet power in 3c 270.1 , the claim of @xcite that there was a civ bal in the sdss spectrum ( under",
    "the formal definition of @xcite per equation ( 8) , below ) is startling . even more so because the absorption of civ in 3c 270.1 was analyzed by r. weymann in @xcite and was an example of what is not a bal , but what they call associated absorption .",
    "since the anti - correlation between the power of extended radio lobes and bals is likely related to the phenomenon of jet launching and bal wind formation , this controversial finding is examined in detail in this section .",
    "the top frame of figure 3 is an overlay of the mmt ( multiple mirror telescope ) data from @xcite and the sdss data ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "the ovi absorption is displayed in the bottom frame of figure 3 .",
    "the upper limit of the continuum is solid red ( the fourth order polynomial fit ) and the blue dashed line is the power law fit from figure 1 .",
    "it is clearly broader and higher velocity than the civ absorber .",
    "the data was plotted with a smoothing window of @xmath56 in the quasar rest frame .",
    "the balnicity index , bi , was defined in @xcite as @xmath57c\\ , dv\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the flux density normalized to the continuum level as a function of @xmath59 , the velocity from the qso rest frame line emission frequency in km / s .",
    "the step function , @xmath60 if and only if there more than 2000 km / s of continuous absorption beyond -3000 km / s .",
    "this measure of broad absorption has been borne out over the years as very robust .",
    "more lax measures of absorption ( such as associated absorption and mini - bals ) have turned out to represent different classes of objects , that have less x - ray absorption than balqsos and larger radio luminosity than bona - fide balqsos @xcite . in deriving this measure ,",
    "the authors considered narrower associated absorption and decided that this was a different phenomenon .",
    "the function @xmath61 was designed to segregate out this type of absorption .    in order to implement equation ( 8) , we need an accurate determination of the redshift . from the [ oiii ]",
    "narrow lines observed in @xcite , we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "this agrees with our uv line analysis of the sdss data , 1.5228 @xmath63 0.0013  at the 1@xmath64 confidence level .",
    "@xmath65 requires absorption beyond -5000 km / s .",
    "thus , from figure 3 and table 1 , there is no absorption beyond -5000 km / s and c = 0 for civ and ovi for all @xmath59 .",
    "these absorption have @xmath66 and are examples of associated absorption that is common in rlqs .",
    "ovi shows absorption maxima at @xmath67 km / s and civ shows absorption at @xmath68 km / s . from the data in @xcite and the sdss data in table 1 ,",
    "the narrow mgii absorption arises from gas that has an outflow velocity of @xmath69 km / sec .",
    "this indicates the following wind dynamic .",
    "there is a a narrow absorption line wind with @xmath70 km / s and second high ionization wind with @xmath71 km / s .",
    "it is not clear if the high ionization wind is the base of a common wind that coasts at @xmath70 km / s farther out .    [",

    "b sources which are at the opposite end of eigenvector 1 from the balqsos ( pop . a sources ) . from table 1 , the peaks of the civ , ciii ] and mgii broad components show small redshifts relative to the quasar systemic velocity consistent with pop b sources @xcite . secondly , here is a tendency for redward asymmetric profiles which is also associated with rlq , pop .",

    "thus , 3c 270.1 is extreme in all its properties , a very strong jet and a very luminous accretion disk .",
    "in the first section , the euv spectrum of 3c 270.1 was found to have @xmath81 .",
    "it was shown that 3c 270.1 has all the properties associated with the one of the most powerful rlq jets in the known universe .",
    "an argument was made that the @xmath36 $ ] - @xmath5 scatter plane ( figure 2 ) can be used to estimate a confidence interval for real time jet power , @xmath41 .",
    "unlike other correlations in the literature involving @xmath0 , such as with emission line properties as in @xcite , it was noted that both the euv and @xmath41 originate from near the central black hole and the correlation in the @xmath34 $ ] - @xmath5 scatter plane therefore indicates a nearly simultaneous causal contact between the two dynamical processes . if not for this circumstance , the estimator for @xmath41 would be unjustified .",
    "the method developed here might have application to other extreme quasars in future studies . in the second section",
    ", it was shown that the civ and ovi absorption had @xmath82 . thus ,",
    "3c 270.1 is not a broad absorption line quasar as classically defined , but displays the well known associated absorption that occurs in many rlqs .",
    "the details of the correlation found in figure 2 was elucidated in two previous studies .",
    "firstly , a correlation induced by larger black hole masses and lower accretion rates in rlqs was ruled out empirically as a plausible explanation due to the indistinguishable sed peak in rlqs and rqqs @xcite .",
    "a partial correlation analysis in @xcite indicates that the fundamental physical correlation amongst quantities is between @xmath83 and @xmath5 .",
    "this correlation is not explained by the @xcite disk wind .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite the most likely explanation of the correlation , jets from magnetic flux in the inner accretion disk , can coexist with these winds .",
    "consistent 3-d mhd numerical models are those in which an annular region ( @xmath84 2 - 4 black hole radii wide ) of the innermost accretion flow , adjacent to the black hole , is perforated by islands of large scale poloidal ( vertical ) magnetic flux . the rotating flux distribution associated with the magnetic islands is the source of the relativistic jet and it also displaces the euv emitting gas , thereby causing an euv deficit that is correlated with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the degree of magnetization of the inner disk determines scaling relations for jet power and the euv decrement .",
    "in particular , based on figure 4 of @xcite , the euv deficit and jet power of 3c 270.1 indicates that @xmath85 of the innermost accretion flow is displaced by the magnetic islands .",
