    "the extremely low key rates afforded by quantum key distribution ( qkd ) compared to computational cryptographic schemes pose a significant challenge to the wide spread adoption of qkd .",
    "the main reason for the poor rate performance is that the qkd _",
    "capacity _ of a single - mode lossy bosonic channel , i.e. , the maximum key rate attainable using any direct - transmission qkd protocol , is proportional to the end - to - end transmissivity of the channel @xmath4 in the high - loss regime .",
    "therefore , to increase the key rate one must increase the number of modes used by the system .",
    "this can be done by increasing the optical bandwidth @xmath5 in modes / s that can be used by the qkd protocol as well as employing multiple spatial modes . here",
    "we investigate the latter .",
    "formally , the qkd capacity of a single - mode bosonic channel where we employ both polarizations of light is @xmath6 bits / s when @xmath7 @xcite .. since @xmath8 , this corresponds to an exponential decay of key rate with distance @xmath9 in fiber and free - space propagation in non - turbulent atmosphere . while the extinction coefficient @xmath10 may be modest for the atmospheric propagation in clear weather at a well - chosen wavelength , the inverse - square decay of rate with distance is unavoidable in the _ far - field _ regime even in vacuum ( where @xmath11 )",
    "this is because free - space optical channel is characterized by the fresnel number product @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the respective areas of the transmitter and receiver apertures , and @xmath15 is the transmission center wavelength . in the far - field regime @xmath16 and only one transmitter - pupil spatial mode couples significant power into the receiver pupil over an @xmath9-meter line - of - sight channel with input - output power transmissivity @xmath17 @xcite",
    "thus , employing multiple orthogonal spatial modes in the far - field regime can not yield a appreciable improvement in the achievable qkd rate .",
    "therefore , our interest in this paper is in the _ near - field _ propagation regime ( @xmath18 ) , which is relevant to metropolitan area qkd , as well as line - of - sight over - the - surface maritime applications of qkd . in this near - field regime",
    ", approximately @xmath19 mutually - orthogonal spatial modes have near - perfect power transmissivity ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , multiplexing over multiple orthogonal spatial modes could substantially improve the total qkd rate with the gain in rate over using a single spatial mode ( such as a focused gaussian beam ) being approximately proportional to @xmath19 , and hence more pronounced at shorter range @xmath9 ( where @xmath19 is high ) .",
    "laguerre - gauss ( lg ) functions in the two - dimensional transverse coordinates form an infinite set of mutually - orthogonal spatial modes , which happen to carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "there have been several suggestions in recent years to employ lg modes for qkd , both based on laser - light and single - photon encodings  @xcite , and the purported rate improvement has been attributed to the oam degree of freedom of the photon . while multiplexing over orthogonal spatial modes",
    "could undoubtedly improve qkd rate in the near - field propagation regime as explained above :    1 .",
    "can other orthogonal spatial mode sets that do _ not _ carry oam be as effective as lg modes in achieving the spatial - multiplexing rate improvement in the near field ? 2 .",
    "does one truly need orthogonal modes to obtain this spatial - multiplexing gain or are there simpler - to - generate mode profiles that might suffice ?",
    "question ( 1 ) was answered affirmatively for classical @xcite and quantum - secure private communication ( without two - way classical communication as is done in qkd )  @xcite over the near - field vacuum propagation and turbulent atmospheric optical channels : hermite - gauss ( hg ) modes are unitarily equivalent to the lg modes and have identical power - transfer eigenvalues @xmath21 , @xmath22 . since the respective communication capacity of mode",
    "@xmath23 is a function of @xmath24 and the transmit power on mode @xmath23 , hg modes , which do _ not _ carry oam , can in principle achieve the same rate as lg modes , notwithstanding that the hardware complexity and efficiency of generation and separation of orthogonal lg and hg modes could be quite different .",
    "our goal is to address questions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above for qkd .",
    "the answer to ( 1 ) is trivially affirmative , at least for the case of vacuum propagation ( no atmospheric turbulence or extinction ) , based on an argument similar to the one used in refs .",
    "we show potential gain of between @xmath0 to @xmath25 orders of magnitude in the key rate by using multiple spatial modes over a @xmath0 km link , assuming @xmath2 cm radii transmitter and receiver apertures , and @xmath26 m laser - light transmission .    the bulk of our analysis addresses question ( 2 ) for the optical vacuum propagation channel , which we answer negatively .",
    "we show that most of the spatial - multiplexing gain afforded by mutually - orthogonal modes ( either hg or lg ) in the near field can be obtained using a focused overlapping gaussian beam array ( ogba ) with optimized beam geometry in which beams are individually amplitude and/or phase modulated to realize the qkd protocol .",
    "these gaussian focused beams ( fbs ) are _ not _ mutually - orthogonal spatial modes , and therefore the power that leaks into fb @xmath23 from the neighboring fbs has the same effect on the key rate @xmath27 of that fb as do excess noise sources like detector dark current or electrical johnson noise .",
    "non - zero excess noise causes the rate - distance function @xmath27 to fall to zero at a minimum transmissivity threshold @xmath28 , or , equivalently , at a maximum range threshold @xmath29 such that @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , while packing the fbs closer increases the spatial - multiplexing gain , it also increases the excess noise on each fb channel , resulting in decreased @xmath27 . for",
    "any given range @xmath9 there should exist an optimal ( key - rate - maximizing ) solution for spatial geometry ( tiling ) of the fbs , power allocation across the fbs , and beam widths .",
    "for shorter range @xmath9 the optimal solution should involve a greater number of fbs , and the number of beams employed should be approximately proportional to @xmath19 .    here , instead of evaluating the optimal rate - maximizing solution as explained above ( which is extremely difficult ) , we find a numerical solution to a constrained optimization problem assuming a square - grid tiling of the fbs in the receiver aperture and restricting our attention to the discrete - variable ( dv ) laser - light decoy - state bb84 protocol  @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind this is to obtain an _ achievable _ rate - distance envelope for the ogba transmitter to compare with the ultimate key capacity attainable by employing infinitely many lg ( or hg ) modes .",
    "since we restrict our attention to dv qkd , we assume that the ogba transmitter is paired with a single - photon detector ( spd ) array at the receiver with square - shaped pixels and unity fill factor with each fb being focused at the center of a detector pixel and there are as many detector pixels as the number of fbs ( the optimal number of which is a function of @xmath9 as discussed above ) .",
    "azimuthal lg modes retain their orthogonality when passed through hard - pupil circular apertures .",
    "thus , generating and separating these modes without any power leaking between them is possible in theory , and has been the subject of much experimental work @xcite .",
    "the current state of the art is the separation of 25 oam modes with average efficiency of @xmath32 , as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we compare the qkd rate achievable with our ogba proposal to what is achievable using ideal separation of azimuthal lg modes as well as the best currently possible . in the latter case",
    ", we obtained the data for the cross - talk ( overlap ) between the separated modes ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 4a ) ) from the authors of @xcite .",
    "we evaluate performance assuming ideal photodetectors and no atmospheric extinction .",
    "we find that the achievable rate using our ogba architecture is at worst @xmath33 db less than the state - of - the - art azimuthal lg mode separation in @xcite and at worst @xmath34 db less than the theoretical maximum for entire azimuthal lg mode set , while using hard - pupil transmitter and receiver apertures of same areas and the same center wavelength .",
    "the maximum rate gap occurs because the square - grid ogba architecture does allow the use of two and three beams ; with two square pixels placed side - by - side at the receiver , the gap between the systems employing the state - of - the - art and ideal azimuthal lg mode separation reduces to @xmath35 db and @xmath36 db , respectively .",
    "current technology for optical communication using orthogonal modes use bulky and expensive components @xcite .",
    "while advances in enabling technology could reduce the device size , weight and cost of orthogonal mode generation and separation , our results show that using oam modes for qkd may not be worth the trouble : the gain in qkd key rate in the near field is modest compared to what can already be obtained by our fairly simple - to - implement ogba architecture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the basic mathematics of laser light propagation in vacuum using soft - pupil ( gaussian attenuation ) apertures . in section [ sec : lgmodes ] we consider the propagation of lg modes using hard - pupil circular apertures , while in section [ sec : gaussian ] we discuss the mathematical model of the ogba architecture that we propose in this paper . using the expressions derived in sections [ sec : lgmodes ] and [ sec : gaussian ] , we numerically evaluate the qkd rate using various beam and aperture geometries , and report the results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results as well as future work , in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "consider propagation of linearly - polarized , quasimonochromatic light with center wavelength @xmath15 ( that is , a narrow transmission band @xmath37 around the center wavelength ) from alice s transmitter pupil in the @xmath38 transverse plane with a complex - field - unit pupil function @xmath39 , @xmath40 , through a @xmath9-meter line - of - sight free - space channel , and received by bob s receiver pupil in the @xmath41 plane with aperture function @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "the overall input - output relationship is described by the following linear - system equation : @xmath46 where the channel s green s function @xmath47 is a spatial impulse response .",
    "we assume vacuum propagation and drop the time argument @xmath48 from the green s function : @xmath49}{i \\lambda l } \\ , a_{\\rm t}({\\bm \\rho}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "normal - mode decomposition of the vacuum - propagation green s function yields an infinite set of orthogonal input - output spatial - mode pairs ( a mode being a normalized spatio - temporal field function of a given polarization ) , that is , an infinite set of non - interfering parallel spatial channels . in other words , @xmath51 where @xmath52 forms a complete orthonormal ( con ) spatial basis in the transmit - aperture plane before the aperture mask @xmath39 , and @xmath53 forms a con spatial basis in the receiver - aperture plane after the aperture mask @xmath42 .",
    "that is , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the kronecker delta function .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : comp_rates ] , the rate gain from using azimuthal lg modes over our ogba architecture is modest : at most @xmath36 db in theory if the entire azimuthal lg mode set is used with perfect separation and at most @xmath35 db with the current state - of - the - art azimuthal lg mode separation implemented in the laboratory ( without accounting for any losses introduced by the mode separation process )",
    ". the losses associated with generating and separating these modes will likely offset this rate improvement .",
    "furthermore , the performance of the ogba ( the green curve ) might improve further if we use hexagonally - packed beam spots as opposed to using a square grid .",
    "however , we have not examined that yet . finally , in the near - field regime",
    ", cv qkd can improve rate substantially over the dv bb84 protocol since the cv scheme can leverage effectively a high - order constellation in the low - loss regime . therefore , it would be instructive to evaluate an ogba architecture employing cv qkd with a heterodyne detection array",
    ".    we assumed vacuum propagation in the results reported in this paper .",
    "we are extending them to account for the atmospheric turbulence in the ongoing work .",
    "clearly , turbulence will adversely affect all systems .",
    "it is known to break the orthogonality of the azimuthal lg modes @xcite . while the classical and private capacities of systems using multiple hg , lg , and fb modes are similar in turbulence @xcite , the effect of turbulence on the qkd systems using ( or not using ) adaptive optics at the transmitter and/or the receiver is still unclear .",
