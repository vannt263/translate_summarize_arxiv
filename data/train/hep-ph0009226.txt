    "we discuss the inclusive cp - violating dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath2 in the standard model of events @xmath0 where the @xmath3 pair is either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of events @xmath7 .",
    "in particular we consider \" @xcite due to complex effects in @xmath8 mixing and decay .",
    "let us review the standard formalism of indirect cp violation@xcite but without making the usual approximations valid when cp violation is `` .",
    "we take the hamiltonian in the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 ) basis as @xmath13 - \\frac{i}{2 }   \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\gamma & \\gamma_{12 } \\\\ \\gamma_{12}^ * & \\gamma   \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are hermitian .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 itself is not hermitian since the @xmath17 mesons do decay .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are obtained from second order perturbation theory : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the standard model weak interaction , @xmath20 is a superweak interaction ( which we consider no further ) , and @xmath21 denotes '' .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath16 are assumed equal due to cpt invariance .",
    "the argument goes as follows : @xmath22 is the amplitude for a @xmath23 to remain a @xmath23 .",
    "applying cpt we obtain the amplitude for a @xmath24 to remain a @xmath24 , _ i.e. _ @xmath25 .",
    "so , if cpt invariance holds , we obtain @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , @xmath27 is the probability per unit time for the decay @xmath28 . applying cpt",
    "we obtain the probability per unit time for @xmath29 . from equation ( [ gamma ] ) for this process , and changing the order of the two brackets , we obtain the probability per unit time for @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 .",
    "so , if cpt invariance holds , we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "the solution to the equation @xmath33 with @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 the phase of @xmath38 is arbitrary : it can be changed by redefining the phase of @xmath39 .",
    "observables depend on the absolute value of @xmath38 , or equivalently on @xmath40 for the same reason , we can multiply @xmath41 and @xmath42 by a common phase - factor .",
    "only the relative phase is observable : @xmath43 we introduce the notation @xmath44 then the probability that a @xmath24 decays as a @xmath23 is @xmath45 similarly , the probability that a @xmath23 decays as a @xmath24 is @xmath46 finally , let us relate @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 these equations are exact for the @xmath1 and @xmath54 systems separately . as a cross check , for @xmath55 we recover the well known results @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "from the box diagrams@xcite of @xmath58 mixing and equation ( [ m ] ) for the standard model , we obtain@xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60    let us now consider the absorptive matrix elements given by equation ( [ gamma ] ) . for @xmath61 equation ( [ gamma ] ) is \" . the tree level feynman diagrams are shown in figures [ gamma11.fig ] and [ gamma12.fig ] .",
    "we arrive at * three * different predictions for the cp - violating asymmetries @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the standard model :    \\1 .",
    "if we require that intermediate quark * spins and momenta * match in the diagrams of figure [ gamma12.fig ] , then we obtain negligible asymmetries as discussed by j. hagelin@xcite",
    ". this result would be correct if quarks were observable .",
    ". however quarks are not observable .",
    "hadrons are observable . due to hadronization , _",
    "i.e. _ due to gluons , * the momenta need not match at the quark level * and we obtain the approximate results shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "( all input numerical data for these calculations not specified in the tables were obtained from @xcite . ) a similar point was emphasized by t. altomari , l. wolfenstein , and j.d .",
    "bjorken@xcite so that their \" .",
    "that conclusion is in agreement with table [ table1 ] .",
    ", due to gluon exchange in the hadronization process , it were a good approximation to * neglect both the requirements of spin and momentum match * , then we obtain approximately the results shown in table [ table2 ] . as an example , suppose that the c - quark in the left hand diagram of figure [ gamma12.fig ] has `` , and the c - quark in the right hand diagram has '' .",
    "this miss - match of spins of the quarks need not imply a miss - match at the hadron level , as can be seen , for example , in the case in which both quarks hadronize into a scalar meson .    which of the three predictions , if any , is correct ?",
    "consider diagrams of the form shown in figure [ gamma11.fig ] . requiring match of spins of the quarks ( and weighting hadronic modes by a factor 3 for color ) we obtain an inclusive branching fraction @xmath64 to be compared with the experimental value @xmath65@xcite .",
    "this is the well known \" @xcite .",
    "but quark spins are not observable .",
    "only hadrons are observable .",
    "so the hadronization process , _ i.e. _ gluons , enhance the decay rate @xmath27 by a factor @xmath66 to account for the observed drop in semi - leptonic branching fraction .",
    "the amplitude of the diagram of figure [ gluon.fig ] is `` with respect to the amplitude of the diagram of figure [ gamma12.fig ] by a factor of order @xmath67 the numbers in parenthesis refer to the figures , and @xmath68 or @xmath69 for the @xmath70 or @xmath71 systems respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath72 was introduced ( somewhat arbitrarily ) on dimensional grounds .",
    "the gluon propagator is @xmath73 .",
    "we take @xmath74 to be of order @xmath75 ( see definition of @xmath76 and @xmath77 in figure [ gluon.fig ] ) . if the outgoing quarks were free , the quark propagator @xmath78 would be on - shell and would diverge .",
    "since the outgoing quarks are confined to dimensions of order @xmath79 fermi , we replace the quark propagator by @xmath80 .",
    "then the order of magnitude estimate of the '' ( [ enhancement ] ) is @xmath81 which is @xmath82 for the @xmath70 system , and @xmath83 for the @xmath71 system .",
    "so , which of the three predictions , if any , is correct ?",
    "prediction 1 by hagelin includes a restriction on @xmath74 due to a miss - match of momenta of the spectator quark , and also requires matching spins .",
    "we have seen that this momentum miss - match can be \" by gluons ( at no cost for the @xmath71 system ) .",
    "therefore we arrive at prediction 2 given in table [ table1 ] which does not require momenta to match but still requires matching spins .",
    "we have seen that hadronization relaxes the need to match spins ( as required by the semi - leptonic branching fraction of @xmath17 mesons )",
    ". then we arrive at prediction 3 given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "since @xmath84@xcite we obtain from table [ table2 ] , @xmath85 to @xmath86 for the allowed range of @xmath87@xcite .",
    "but for the @xmath71 system the gluon in the diagram of figure [ gluon.fig ] can even enhance the asymmetry * above * the prediction given in table [ table2 ] . note that relaxing the requirement of matching spins we obtain a large @xmath88 as predicted in @xcite , leading to interesting experimental consequences@xcite .    .standard model calculation of the dimuon charge asymmetries @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and other parameters , as a function of the angles @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the unitarity triangle@xcite , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93gev .",
