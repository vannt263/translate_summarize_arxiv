    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an extension of the standard model ( sm ) space - time symmetry algebra  @xcite@xcite that leads to a tightly constrained set of new particles and interactions and addresses a number of open problems in electroweak - scale physics .",
    "these problems include the stabilization of the weak / planck scale hierarchy , the origin of the negative higgs mass parameter driving electroweak symmetry breaking , and the existence of dark matter .",
    "however , if susy is discovered in the laboratory , even the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) will introduce a significant collection of new lagrangian parameters to be measured .",
    "many of these parameters are soft masses that explicitly break susy and lift the superpartner spectrum above that of the sm particles .",
    "it is expected that the fundamental source of susy - breaking should be spontaneous rather than explicit , and viable phenomenology is most easily achieved if the breaking takes place in a hidden sector of fields that couple to the mssm only through higher - dimensional operators .",
    "these operators may be generated by integrating out degrees of freedom associated with a characteristic  messenger scale \" @xmath1 .",
    "eventually , with experimental input for several soft masses , it will become interesting to look for patterns that encode the origin of these operators and explain precisely how susy - breaking is communicated to the mssm .",
    "there are several approaches to testing hypotheses about the high scale susy - breaking theory and reassembling its parameters from low scale data .",
    "one standard method is a top - down fit of high scale parameters to the tev scale measurements . in the top - down procedure",
    ", a monte carlo scan is performed over the inputs at @xmath1 , the soft parameters are rg - evolved to the tev scale , observables are calculated , and a @xmath2 statistic is computed for each point in the scan  @xcite@xcite . in another method ,",
    "the bottom - up approach , one starts with low scale soft parameters and rg - evolves them up until they reach a scale where some structure emerges  @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3-functions of all soft sfermion and higgs parameters are sensitive to both the gaugino masses and the hypercharge @xmath0-term , @xmath4 , while the third generation soft sfermion @xmath3-functions contain the soft trilinear parameters . therefore , all the low - scale soft parameters must be measured before bottom - up reconstruction methods can be used reliably .    a third , complimentary method",
    "is provided by 1-loop renormalization group invariant  ( rgi ) quantities in the mssm  @xcite . given a model for the generation of the soft parameters at @xmath1 , rgis facilitate the construction of a wide class of sum rules satisfied by the tev scale masses .",
    "these sum rules can be used either to increase confidence that the model is correct , or to predict unmeasured masses from known masses .",
    "rgis can also be used to reconstruct fundamental parameters at the messenger scale .",
    "the rgi reconstruction method is entirely algebraic , and most importantly , it can provide considerable information even if some of the rg - coupled masses in the theory are unknown .",
    "this feature is most apparent in models with @xmath5 degrees of freedom at @xmath1 , and occurs for two reasons : some messenger scale parameters can be reconstructed with rgis that depend only on a limited set of tev scale masses , and every sum rule can be traded for an unknown tev scale parameter .",
    "furthermore , the ability to determine messenger scale parameters with rgis suggests a useful complementarity to the top - down approach : every parameter that can be constrained directly with the rgi method can have its range considerably reduced in a monte carlo scan .",
    "one powerful constraint on the susy - breaking mediation mechanism is already known , and comes from the absence of experimental evidence for large flavor - changing neutral currents . although not the only method , the simplest approach to achieve agreement with limits from flavor physics is to assume flavor - blindness of the soft parameters at the messenger scale  @xcite@xcite . an attractive way to communicate susy - breaking such that the soft sfermion masses are automatically flavor - universal",
    "is known as gauge mediation  @xcite@xcite , wherein the hidden sector couples to the mssm only through sm gauge interactions . as the name suggests , assuming a single messenger scale , general gauge mediation ( ggm )  @xcite is the most general formulation of gauge mediation . in this class of models",
    "the mssm soft masses are determined at high scales by current - current correlation functions in the hidden sector .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the application of rgis to flavor - blind messenger scale models .",
    "we found that under the well - motivated low scale approximations of minimal flavor violation and degenerate first and second generation soft sfermion masses ( as well as the assumption of no new sources of @xmath6-violation in the sfermion sector ) , 14 rgis could be used to test the flavor - blindness hypothesis and reconstitute all high scale soft parameters as functions of a single undetermined scale .",
    "we then applied the method of rgis to ggm and studied the sensitivity with which certain invariants can detect deviations from a ggm pattern of low scale masses .",
    "ggm provides a particularly nice illustration of the method , because under certain conditions , there are exactly enough nonzero invariants so that all parameters controlling the soft masses at the messenger scale and the messenger scale itself can be determined .",
    "although the application to ggm emphasizes the simplicity of the rgi method , the large number of free parameters in the theory obscures the usefulness of the fact that no single invariant depends on all of the soft masses .",
    "it is interesting to consider instead what can be done if only a subset of the soft masses are determined . with this assumption",
    ", it becomes necessary to consider more restrictive models of susy - breaking with fewer parameters .",
    "a convenient example is minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) , the simplest explicit implementation of gauge mediation . in mgm , a single complete @xmath7 representation ( @xmath8 ) representations , which alters the relationship between the gaugino and the sfermion masses ; we will comment on this possibility further below , but for our purposes in this work we define mgm to be the case @xmath9 . ]",
    "( @xmath8 ) of `` messenger '' particles with characteristic mass scale @xmath1 couple directly to the susy - breaking vacuum expectation value in the hidden sector , while coupling only to the gauge sector of the mssm .",
    "integrating out the messengers at the scale @xmath1 produces soft masses of the same form as in ggm , but with specific relationships between all the soft masses  ( gauginos as well as the sfermions ) , controlled by only one mass parameter and the gauge couplings at the messenger scale .",
    "additional contributions to the soft susy - breaking masses in the higgs sector may be required by the solution to the @xmath10-problem , and these contributions can be included with the unknown parameters of the model .",
    "in this study we continue the analysis of the rgis and focus on their use in the case of less - than - complete information about the low energy soft spectrum . for illustration we work in the context of mgm and consider rgis that are functions only of the gaugino and the first generation soft masses .",
    "if a third generation mass goes unmeasured , it will not be possible to test the flavor - blindness hypothesis completely .",
    "however , the vanishing of one particular rgi , @xmath11 , in addition to two standard rgi sum rules encoding gaugino mass unification , will still provide a strong hint that a gauge - mediated mechanism is at work .",
    "we will use the remaining rgis to reconstruct fundamental mgm input parameters and to build two new sum rules satisfied by the gaugino and the first generation soft masses in mgm .    in section 1",
    "we briefly review the rgis in ggm and mgm and use them to formulate new sum rules in the latter . in section 2 ,",
    "we study the mgm sum rules from the first of two directions . analyzing a minimal set of `` realistic '' experimental measurements , and after making a simple approximation to absorb the bulk of the 2-loop corrections  @xcite , we find that the gluino mass @xmath12 , the left - handed squark mass @xmath13 , and the right - handed selectron mass @xmath14 are sufficient to predict the rest of the first generation and gaugino mgm soft spectrum using the sum rules . from these measurements",
    "we also extract the messenger scale gauge couplings ( and thus the messenger scale itself ) , non - mgm corrections to the higgs masses at the messenger scale ( encoded in @xmath15 ) , and the values of the hypercharge , baryon number , and lepton number @xmath0-terms ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) for the third generation and higgs at the superpartner scale @xmath19 . in section 3",
    "we consider the complementary scenario in which all of the first generation and gaugino masses have been measured .",
    "the sum rules can then be checked directly , and the question arises : how well can an mgm mechanism of susy - breaking be distinguished from more general gauge - mediated mechanisms ?",
    "we concentrate in particular on the new sum rules involving the sfermion mass parameters , which are more complex than the well - known sum rules of gaugino mass unification .",
    "a 1-parameter ggm family of deviations from mgm is found that yields the same first generation and gaugino spectrum , and thus does not violate the sum rules .",
    "we discuss methods to distinguish these ggm models from mgm .",
    "we find formulations of the sum rules that efficiently test other deviations from mgm and follow the analytical analysis with a detailed numerical investigation of the constraints .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the ggm framework introduces 6 parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 controlling the soft masses , as well as the messenger scale @xmath1 at which the sector transmitting susy - breaking to the mssm can be integrated out , for a total of 7 degrees of freedom in the observed soft spectrum at low scales .",
    "additional model parameters include the bilinear higgs mass term ( or , alternatively , the corresponding value of @xmath22 , the ratio of the higgs vaccum expectation values ) and the soft trilinear couplings , but they do not appear in the rgis and we will not need to consider them further in our analysis . explicitly , the gaugino masses are proportional to three constants @xmath21 , into the definitions of the @xmath21 . ] @xmath23 and the soft sfermion and higgs masses are proportional to three additional parameters @xmath20 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 runs over the three gauge groups and the @xmath26 are quadratic casimirs for the sfermion representations .",
    ".1-loop rg invariants in the mssm [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     while simple deviations are instructive , it is interesting to consider more general displacements from mgm , particularly those that fall directly along the invariant line as stressed previously , a moderate probe of such cases is offered by enforcing the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ gaugeineq ] ) . to estimate the power of the inequalities , in fig .",
    "[ invlinefig ] we plot the projection of the invariant line onto the @xmath27 and @xmath28 planes for three values of the messenger scale , coloring points according to whether or not an inequality is violated outside of the error bars . for the estimation of the uncertainties we use a fixed spectrum near @xmath29 gev and retain the @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "a more precise calculation does not qualitatively alter the results .",
    "since values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 lead to reconstructed mgm messenger scales that are larger than the true @xmath1 , for low @xmath1 such deviations are difficult to detect . on the other hand , @xmath33 and @xmath34 easily violate the inequalities . at large @xmath1",
    "the reverse holds since there is not a large margin for the allowed overestimation of the scale .",
    "in this work we have shown that 1-loop renormalization group invariant quantities in the mssm may be used to study the structure and parameters of susy - breaking , even if only a subset of the soft breaking parameters can be determined experimentally .",
    "working in the specific example of minimal gauge mediation , we found rgi sum rules in the first generation and gaugino sectors that may be used to make predictions for unknown soft masses .",
    "we demonstrated that the measurement of one gaugino mass and two first generation sfermion masses at the lhc is sufficient to determine the rest of the first generation and gaugino spectrum in mgm models , three @xmath0-term relations constraining the third generation and higgs spectrum , and the high energy input parameters @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 ) , and the messenger scale .",
    "it is of particular interest that the relevant rgis are independent of the higgs sector soft parameters , the soft trilinear couplings , and all third generation soft masses , which may be more difficult to extract from experimental data .    in the case",
    "that the first generation and gaugino masses are known , we showed that the sum rules are sensitive to most deviations into the broader parameter space of general gauge mediation , including variations in the sfermion mass parameters that are more complicated to assess than those in the gaugino sector .",
    "however , the sum rules can not completely differentiate mgm from ggm .",
    "a 1-parameter subset of ggm models is consistent with the same low energy first generation and gaugino spectrum as a given mgm model , but is associated with different values of ( @xmath36 ) and the messenger scale .",
    "therefore , the ggm models that survive the mgm constraints are limited by the requirement that the reconstructed messenger scale lies within an acceptable window .",
    "it would be interesting to study the breakdown of the degeneracy between mgm and ggm models in the third generation and higgs spectrum , as well as the determination of ( @xmath37 ) in mgm models .",
    "furthermore , it is of great interest to investigate the complementarity between the rgi method and the top - down approach to susy parameter determination . in the event",
    "that a parameter can be fixed via rgi relations , it can be restricted in a @xmath2 fit , potentially improving the uncertainties from the fit .",
    "also omitted from our study is a full analysis of other susy - breaking scenarios , including mgm with @xmath38 @xmath7 representations of messenger particles .",
    "we leave such work for the future .",
