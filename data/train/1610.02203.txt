    "in two recent experiments  @xcite the energy of an impurity immersed in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been measured using rf spectroscopy and a feshbach resonance to tune the impurity - bath interaction strength .",
    "the most striking result is the existence of a well defined quasiparticle peak which , on the attractive branch of the bose polaron , extends up to the unitary point where the impurity is resonantly interacting with the medium . in the experiment carried out at jila  @xcite a low density gas of fermionic @xmath1k impurities",
    "is superimposed to a bec of @xmath2rb atoms , whereas researchers in aarhus have used two different hyperfine states of bosonic @xmath3k atoms .",
    "even though the qualitative results are similar in the two experiments , quantitative differences in the energy spectrum arise due to the different mass ratio , @xmath4 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath6 is the mass of the particles in the bec and @xmath7 is the mass of the impurity , as well as to the different gas parameter of the medium , respectively @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the jila and aarhus experiment being @xmath10 the density and @xmath11 the scattering length describing interactions within the bec .",
    "further differences , concerning in particular the width of the spectrum at resonance , might arise from the different role played by efimov physics in the two cases  @xcite .    in a previous study  @xcite we characterized the properties of the bose polaron using quantum monte carlo methods in the case where the impurity and the particles in the bec have the same mass .",
    "in particular , we determined the dependence of the binding energy of the impurity resonantly interacting with the bath by varying the gas parameter of the bec . in the present work",
    "we extend the previous calculations by analyzing how this energy changes also as a function of the mass ratio @xmath12 .",
    "we report on results ranging from the value @xmath13 of the light impurities used in the jila experiment  @xcite to @xmath14 corresponding to the limit of a static impurity .",
    "this latter case is an interesting reference problem , which has an exact solution for an impurity in a fermi sea  @xcite , and for the bose polaron is expected to have a universal dependence on the gas parameter of the bath .",
    "we also calculate the binding energy of the attractive branch for the parameters of the jila experiment in order to allow for a direct comparison .",
    "we calculate the ground state of the following hamiltonian @xmath15 describing a system of @xmath16 bosons of mass @xmath6 and one impurity of mass @xmath7 .",
    "the particle coordinates are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for the impurity and the bosons .",
    "the pair potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote , respectively , the boson - boson and the boson - impurity interaction and depend on the distance between the two particles . similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we model @xmath22 using hard spheres with diameter @xmath11 , which corresponds to the value of the inter - bosons @xmath23-wave scattering length . for the boson - impurity interaction @xmath24",
    "we use a zero - range potential characterized by the scattering length @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method used in the simulations has been already described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer the reader to this reference for details on the numerical technique .    the mass - ratio dependence , arising from @xmath26 , is accounted for in the qmc simulations by the properly corrected contribution of the impurity kinetic energy .",
    "another slight modification compared to the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite concerns the trial wave function @xmath27 and arises from the zero - range nature of the impurity - boson potential .",
    "the boson - boson jastrow correlation term @xmath28 coincides with the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the impurity - boson function is given by @xmath29 here the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are fixed by the continuity condition of the function @xmath32 and its first derivative at the matching point @xmath33 .",
    "this latter and the parameter @xmath34 are optimized using a variational procedure on the total energy .",
    "it is important to stress that the jastrow term ( [ jastrow ] ) , which is singular in @xmath35 , allows one to remove completely the interaction potential @xmath24 from the calculation of the energy and to substitute it with the contact boundary condition @xmath36 , fixed by the impurity - boson scattering length @xmath25 .",
    "this procedure of replacing a short - range potential with the corresponding bethe - peierls boundary conditions has been already introduced in qmc simulations  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that all the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the square - well potential @xmath24 with the smallest range are faithfully reproduced by the choice ( [ jastrow ] ) of the trial wave function  @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the impurity is defined as the energy difference @xmath37 between the ground states of the system with @xmath16 bosons and the impurity and of the clean system with only @xmath16 bosons .",
    "both energies are calculated using the qmc method described in ref .",
    "@xcite for fixed values of @xmath16 in a box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is achieved by ensuring that @xmath16 is large enough to make finite - size effects negligible .",
    "all energies are measured in units of the following convenient scale provided by the bath @xmath38 which corresponds to the fermi energy of a single - component fermi gas with the same density and mass .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    ) as a function of the mass ratio @xmath12 .",
    "results corresponding to different values of the interaction strength in the bath are shown .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath39 refers to the conditions of the jila experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=321 ]    in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] we report the results of the binding energy @xmath40 at the resonant value of the impurity - boson interaction ( @xmath41 ) for different values of the mass ratio @xmath12 and of the gas parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the same results are shown in fig .",
    "the chosen values of the mass ratio range from @xmath14 , corresponding to the case of a static impurity with infinite mass , to @xmath13 . for lighter impurity masses ( @xmath43 )",
    "the calculation of @xmath40 becomes increasingly difficult because of instabilities towards the formation of cluster states .",
    "we notice that , at a given interaction strength within the bath , the binding energy decreases when the mass ratio increases .",
    "this effect is small for mass ratios up to @xmath44 , while a larger drop of @xmath40 is seen when the impurity gets lighter than the particles in the medium .",
    "the case of a static impurity ( @xmath14 ) resonantly coupled to the medium is particularly interesting .",
    "first of all , as visible from the results in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] , it applies also to physically relevant situations where @xmath7 is significantly larger than @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , it is a reference problem which in case of the equivalent fermi polaron , _",
    "i. e. _ a static impurity resonantly coupled to a single - component fermi sea , features the exact solution @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic counterpart is not exactly solvable , nevertheless , since efimov physics is irrelevant due to the vanishing mass ratio  @xcite and also tetramer and larger bound states should not play any role , one expects that @xmath46 is a universal function of the gas parameter in the bec .",
    "the results for the inverse binding energy @xmath47 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "one finds that @xmath40 decreases with decreasing gas parameter , remaining however always greater than the above mentioned fermi polaron value . in the same fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we also report the corresponding results for the mass ratio @xmath5  @xcite which exhibit a similar trend as a function of @xmath42 , but the value of @xmath40 is about a factor of two larger compared to the static impurity .",
    "noticeably , the resonant fermi polaron shows a much weaker dependence on the mass ratio as it reaches @xmath49 for equal masses  @xcite .",
    "one should also notice that , for both values of mass ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the dependence of the energy @xmath40 on the interaction strength @xmath42 in the bath is significant .",
    "large variations are also predicted for the mass ratio @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "we point out that such a strong dependence is completely underestimated in other theoretical approaches to the bose polaron problem where interactions within the condensate are either completely neglected , as in the variational approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , or produce only small effects , as in the t - matrix approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , the effect of three - body correlations is investigated and a significant decrease of the polaron energy is found as a result of the avoided crossing between the quasiparticle and the deepest efimov state .",
    "we investigated the presence of cluster states , _",
    "i.e. _ bound states of the impurity with two or more bosons , at resonant coupling both for the mass ratio @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "while in this latter case we find very shallow bound states of up to five bosons  @xcite , in the case of a static impurity no bound states are found within our model of hard - sphere boson - boson interactions .",
    "the role of such cluster states , and in particular of efimov trimers , becomes important in the proximity of the resonance by adding new length scales to the problem and thereby suppressing the universal character of the polaron energy in terms of the gas parameter of the surrounding bec  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results for @xmath5 describe correctly the polaron ground state provided the energy of the deepest efimov trimer is much smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "we decided to plot the results for the binding energy in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in terms of @xmath47 in order to discuss more properly the limit @xmath51 . for the static impurity at @xmath41",
    ", one can easily verify that an ideal bose gas , featuring @xmath52 , is unstable against collapse and yields a binding energy @xmath40 which scales with the @xmath53 law of the number of bosons  @xcite .",
    "results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show instead that @xmath54 does not scale to zero as @xmath51 , provided that one first takes the thermodynamic limit at fixed @xmath42 and only after allows the gas parameter to approach zero .",
    "the mobile impurity with mass ratio @xmath5 exhibits a similar behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , in this case , one expects that for small enough densities the energy @xmath40 approaches the binding energy of the deepest cluster state .    ) as a function of the gas parameter in the bath .",
    "results are shown for a mobile impurity with @xmath5 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and for a static impurity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the solid lines are polynomial fits to the data including first and second order terms in @xmath48.,width=321 ]    .",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath13 and is close to the case of @xmath1k impurities in a bec of @xmath2rb atoms as in the jila experiment  @xcite .",
    "the gas parameter has also been chosen to reproduce the experimental value @xmath55 .",
    "the experimental points are reproduced from fig .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the blue dashed line corresponds to the prediction of perturbation theory including first and second order terms .",
    ", width=321 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we compare the binding energy obtained from our qmc simulations with the results of the jila experiment  @xcite .",
    "both the value of the chosen mass ratio , @xmath13 , and of the interaction strength , @xmath39 , are close to the parameters of the experiment .",
    "the results cover the whole attractive branch of the bose polaron with @xmath56 from the weakly interacting regime , where @xmath57 is on the order of the interparticle distance @xmath58 and good agreement is found with the prediction of second - order perturbation theory  @xcite , to the resonant point achieved at @xmath41 .",
    "the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is good , although the large experimental uncertainty does not allow for a stringent comparison . in the case of the aarhus experiment  @xcite ,",
    "where @xmath9 and @xmath5 , our results would predict @xmath59 at @xmath41 , which is more than a factor two smaller than the measured value . a possible explanation of this discrepancy can come from the presence of efimov trimers  @xcite or larger cluster states , which within our hard - core model are irrelevant since they occur at very small energies  @xcite .",
    "it is however unclear why such correlations appear to be less effective in the case of the jila experiment , where the quasiparticle peak remains well defined up to the resonant point  @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , we calculated the binding energy of the bose polaron resonantly coupled to the surrounding bath as a function of the mass ratio and of the interaction strength within the medium , thereby extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite where only the equal - mass case was considered .",
    "furthermore , we determine the equation of state of a static impurity in terms of the gas parameter of the bec . these results can be useful in understanding to what extent the properties of the bose polaron are universal functions of the boson - impurity scattering length and of the strength of interactions in the medium . in the case of the recent jila experiment  @xcite , our results for the corresponding value of the mass ratio are in good agreement with the measured polaron energy along the attractive branch .",
    "this work was supported by the quic grant of the horizon2020 fet program and by provincia autonoma di trento .",
    "notice that in the qmc method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath60 acts as a guiding function used for importance sampling .",
    "its singular behavior exhibited at small impurity - boson separations implies that the true many - body wave function satisfies the same bethe - peierls boundary conditions as @xmath60 .",
    "this can be explicitly proven by analyzing the `` pure '' impurity - boson correlation function .",
    "one considers a sphere of radius @xmath61 surrounding the impurity and impenetrable boundary conditions for the bosons on the surface of the sphere .",
