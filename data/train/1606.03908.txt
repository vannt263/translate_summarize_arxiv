    "more than a century ago , ramsden discovered that suspended colloidal particles show a strong affinity for fluid interfaces compared to the bulk @xcite .",
    "this is due to a particle induced reduction of the interfacial area between the two fluids .",
    "typically , the resulting decrease in the interfacial free energy is much larger than the thermal energy .",
    "thus the attachment of the colloids to the interface is almost irreversible and the trapped particles form an effectively two - dimensional system .",
    "these colloidal monolayers are important for a wide range of industrial and biological proccesses .",
    "for example , emulsions , including many food emulsions , are stabilized by the adsorption of colloidal particles at liquid - liquid interfaces @xcite ; encapsulation and delivery of drugs or nutrients can be achieved through colloidosomes @xcite .",
    "froth flotation , which involves the separation of hydrophilic from hydrophobic particles by attaching the latter to air bubbles in a suspension , plays a key role in mineral processing , water purification , oil recovery , bacteria separation , and for recycling of plastics @xcite . since the particles are confined only in the vertical direction but are free to move along the interfacial plane , the stability of such monolayer structures is , to a large extent , determined by the effective inter - particle interaction and therefore a proper understanding of this lateral interaction is highly desired .",
    "the effective interaction between particles at an interface is quite different from that present in the bulk .",
    "all types of interactions , such as electrostatic , magnetic , or van der waals , which are present in the bulk , are also present at the interface , albeit in a different form . on top of that",
    ", particles interact via deformations of the fluid interface , which can be generated by gravity , electric stress gradients , or magnetic fields @xcite . here , however , we are not concerned with these interface - mediated capillary or elastic interactions , but we shall focus only on the electrostatically induced effective interaction between the particles . the evolution of the studies concerned with the electrostatic interaction in this context dates back to 1980 , when pieranski reported the two - dimensional crystallization of polystyrene particles at an air - water interface and attributed it to a purely repulsive , long - ranged dipolar interaction originating from the asymmetric counterion distribution across the interface and acting through air @xcite .",
    "hurd confirmed these predictions @xcite , based on analytical calculations within the framework of linearized pb theory and on the assumption that the particles are separated by distances large compared to their radii .",
    "later studies reported a weakening of the effective interaction upon increasing the ionic strength of the corresponding polar medium which differs from hurd s prediction @xcite .",
    "as a possible explanation this has been linked to the relatively small amount of residual charges present at the particle - oil @xcite or the particle - air @xcite interface , but an unanimous picture is still lacking",
    ".    a major simplification used in almost all studies mentioned above as well as in related studies consists of considering large inter - particle separations for which both the superposition approximation and the linearization of the pb equation are taken to be valid .",
    "the associated dipolar interaction is also a signature of this key simplification .",
    "but for short inter - particle distances @xcite , which is relevant for dense systems or self - organization processes , none of them are actually applicable . in a recent publication @xcite , we have discussed the drawbacks of the superposition assumption not only at short inter - particle distances but also at large distances .",
    "the assumption concerning the linearization of the pb equation , which leads to the well known debye - hckel ( dh ) equation , requires the electrostatic energy of a single charge in solution to be much smaller than the thermal energy .",
    "while this might hold true at distances far from the particle , at short distances this is violated for most experimental setups . for highly charged colloids , which are also quite common , the situation becomes worse , even at relatively large distances .",
    "moreover , nonlinear charge renormalization effects are known to alter the strength of the effective interaction potential significantly @xcite .",
    "hence , appropriate insight into the effective interaction between a pair of particles , especially at small separations , remains elusive without including nonlinearity .",
    "this formulates the goal of the present study .",
    "even a mean - field description like the pb equation , which is adequate to describe interfacial structures above the atomic scale , poses already a significant challenge .",
    "therefore , we numerically solve a simplified model by replacing the spherical particles with planar walls in the spirit of the derjaguin approximation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "this simplification is justified because we focus on short inter - particle separations only .",
    "the validity of such an assumption has been verified also for infinitely long cylinders at an oil - water interface @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider the particles to float on a flat interface and that they are immersed in both fluid phases to the same extent .",
    "this corresponds to a liquid - particle contact angle of @xmath0 which is equal or close to what one observes in many experimental systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is known that for high stability of particle - stabilized emulsions , the contact angle should not deviate strongly from @xmath0 @xcite . in order to keep the present investigation general and in order to be consistent with previous experimental studies @xcite , we consider surface charges on both sides of the fluid - fluid - interface . the electrostatic problem for this model system is solved by employing the framework of density functional theory @xcite and the resulting effective interaction energy is divided into two parts : a surface contribution , expressed per total surface area , and a line contribution per total length of the two three - phase contact lines formed by solid - liquid - liquid coexistence .",
    "a comparison of our results with those obtained within linear theory reveals both quantitative and qualitative differences concerning the effective line interaction energy ( figs .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) ) , quantitative differences concerning the surface interaction energies ( figs .",
    "2(a)(d ) ) , and a dependence of the line contribution on the solvation properties of the two adjacent fluids which is not captured by the linear theory ( fig .  4 )",
    "in a three - dimensional cartesian coordinate system , the walls are considered to be placed at @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the two slabs ( @xmath3 with @xmath4 ) in between are filled with medium `` 1 '' @xmath5 and medium `` 2 '' @xmath6 , respectively . the walls are chemically identical in nature but the surface charge density @xmath7 on each wall varies depending on the surrounding medium : @xmath8 on the upper half planes ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 on the lower half planes ( @xmath11 ) . since the layering of solvent molecules and ions takes place close to the walls and to the interface on the length scale of the bulk correlation length which , typically , is comparable to the molecular scale and which is much smaller than the length scale of interest here , the solvents in both media are taken to be structureless , homogeneous , linear dielectric fluids .",
    "therefore , the permittivity @xmath12 , which is the product of the relative permittivity @xmath13 and the permittivity @xmath14 of vaccum , varies steplike at the interface between the fluids : @xmath15 for @xmath9 and @xmath16 for @xmath11 .",

    "as expected , for @xmath56 ( which corresponds to the linear theory ) , our numerical results match with the corresponding analytical results over the whole range of separations considered here .",
    "the most significant changes take place upon increasing the degree of nonlinearity @xmath55 from @xmath56 ( linear theory ) to @xmath96 , whereas for @xmath97 basically no changes occur upon increasing @xmath55 further .",
    "the surface interaction @xmath95 within the linear theory differs by orders of magnitude from the one within the nonlinear theory .",

    "for them the linear theory predicts a monotonically weakening , attractive interaction upon increasing separations between the walls . upon increasing the degree of nonlinearity @xmath55 ,",
    "the strength of this interaction decreases and @xmath76 becomes nonmonotonic for @xmath104 forming a minimum at a distance @xmath105 which , for typical debye lengths of @xmath106 corresponding to a @xmath92 ( @xmath107 ) aqueous solution , is well above the molecular scale ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "regardless of the type of interaction discussed above , for @xmath109 its magnitude within the linear theory is at least one order of magnitude larger than within the nonlinear theory .    within the linearized pb theory it is a common practice to use renormalized instead of bare surface charge densities in order to capture the correct asymptotic behavior of the electrostatic potential at _ large _ distances @xcite .",
    "however , in the present study we are interested in the opposite limit of _ short _ distances .",
    "still , it is interesting to see the effects of charge renormalization on @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",

    "the corresponding results are presented in fig .",
    "as expected , both @xmath95 and @xmath69 decrease in magnitude compared to the case of bare surface charge densities , but a significant quantitative mismatch compared with the full nonlinear behavior is still present .",
    "however , the results corresponding to the linear theory with bare or renormalized charge densities show the same qualitative behavior",
    ". therefore , features like the minimum in fig .",
    "3(b ) can not be explained by simply using surface charge renormalization within the linear pb theory .",
    "the strong reduction in strength of both the surface and the line parts raises the question concerning the relevance of the electrostatic interaction . in order to answer this",
    ", we compare our results with the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction which is calculated in terms of the hamaker constant @xcite . for two flat surfaces made of polystyrene and interacting accross pure water , the hamaker constant @xmath122 is reported to lie in the interval @xmath123\\times10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{j}$ ] @xcite . even for the maximal value of @xmath122 ,",
    "the vdw attraction energy @xmath124 per cross - sectional area due to the two surfaces is either comparable ( for @xmath125 ) or less by at least one order of magnitude compared to the corresponding electrostatic part .",
    "it is important to note that salting the water further decreases the vdw contribution slightly due to the electrostatic screening effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic part still contributes significantly to the total effective interaction .",
    "we are not aware of any such data regarding the line contribution to the interaction .    in the following",
    "we discuss the effects of varying the free parameters of our system . to this end ,",
    "one of the five dimensionless parameters @xmath84 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , or @xmath129 is varied at a time , keeping the remaining ones fixed .",
    "first , we consider the dimensionless donnan potential @xmath84 .",
    "according to the linear theory @xcite , all three @xmath66- dependent interaction energies , i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath103 , and @xmath69 , are independent of @xmath46 , which is confirmed by our numerical results . moreover ,",
    "this holds for the surface interactions @xmath95 and @xmath103 for arbitrary degrees @xmath55 of nonlinearity .",
    "in contrast , the line part @xmath76 exhibits a completely different behavior ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "for @xmath56 , @xmath76 is attractive at all separations @xmath66 and independent of the value of @xmath46 .",
    "however , for @xmath130 the line interaction @xmath76 does depend on @xmath46 ( fig .  4(b ) ) . starting from @xmath131 , @xmath76 hardly changes upon increasing the order of nonlinearity @xmath55 .",
    "figure  4(c ) displays the corresponding results for @xmath99 . for @xmath132",
    ", @xmath76 differs significantly in magnitude but it is repulsive everywhere , whereas for @xmath91 , which corresponds to its value in the standard set of parameters , it is repulsive at close separations @xmath66 , but attractive further away .",
    "it is also worth noting that for @xmath132 , the predictions of the linear theory are qualitatively wrong at all separations @xmath66 .",
    "effects of changing the remaining parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are shown in fig .",
    "although here we present the results corresponding to the degree of nonlinearity @xmath99 , for each set of parameters , the interaction energy curves basically do not change for @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , in view of potential future studies , we conclude that it is sufficient to truncate the taylor series in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) at @xmath131 .",
    "we change @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 by changing @xmath133 , @xmath121 , and @xmath18 , respectively , while keeping their counterparts for medium `` 1 '' fixed .",
    "consequently , @xmath95 does not change upon these variations ; it changes only upon varying @xmath129 . as shown by fig .  5 , although @xmath103 remains always repulsive ( left column of panels ) , both its magnitude and its range depend on the above parameters .",
    "an increase in @xmath126 or @xmath127 strengthens the repulsion whereas an increase in @xmath128 or @xmath129 weakens the repulsion .",
    "the range of this repulsive energy is set by the debye length ( or equivalently the ionic strength ) in medium  2 \" ; for lower ionic strength the range increases . upon changing @xmath129 , @xmath95 behaves similarly as @xmath103 ( see inset in fig .",
    "regarding the line interaction energy @xmath76 , the observed minimum for the standard set of parameters becomes deeper and shifts towards smaller separations upon decreasing @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "on the other hand , it becomes more shallow and shifts to a larger separation distance @xmath66 upon decreasing @xmath128 or @xmath129 .",
    "since in our system medium `` 2 '' is the less polar phase and since the standard values for @xmath126 and @xmath128 are already close to unity , we do not have the option to increase these two quantities further .",
    "nonetheless , the concomitant trends can be easily inferred from the data presented here .",
    "what remains to be discussed is the relative importance of the line interaction @xmath134 as compared to the surface interactions @xmath135 and @xmath136 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , the surface contributions scale with the area of the walls whereas the line contribution scales with the length of the three - phase contact lines . hence , for sufficiently large surface area , the surface contributions eventually dominate .",
    "however , depending on the system parameters , the line contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) can dominate over the surface contributions even for typical sizes of the colloid particles .",
    "for example , we consider a generic system which consists of a water - lutidine ( 2,6-dimethylpyridine ) mixture with nai salt at temperature @xmath93 , occupying the space between the two charged walls with an effective area @xmath137 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the effective length of the three - phase contact line is taken as @xmath138 .",

    "the relative permittivities of the water- and lutidine - rich phases are given by @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "the walls carry a surface charge density of @xmath143 in contact with the water - rich phase and a surface charge density of @xmath144 in contact with the lutidine - rich phase . therefore the system is characterized by the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath91 .",
    "for such a system , the line contribution for a wall separation @xmath149 ( or @xmath150 ) , corresponding to the position of the minimum of @xmath134 , is @xmath151 , whereas the surface contributions are @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "systems with other media are characterized by a different set of values for @xmath126 , @xmath128 , and @xmath84 . for an oil with a smaller value of @xmath154 the line interaction",
    "is expected to be more prominent because , with decreasing @xmath126 , @xmath136 decreases whereas the minimum in @xmath134 becomes deeper ( see figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath128 can change in at least two ways : an increase of @xmath155 leads to a faster decay of @xmath135 whereas a decrease of @xmath18 shifts the minimum of @xmath156 to larger values of @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "therefore , in both cases , the relative importance of the line interaction @xmath134 with respect to the surface interactions increases upon increasing @xmath128 .",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath84 will also deepen the minimum in @xmath156 leading to a stronger line interaction ( see fig .",

    "depending on the values chosen for the free parameters , @xmath68 can either increase or decrease with increasing @xmath55 ; in some cases ( e.g. , for @xmath163 ) it varies by two orders of magnitude upon increasing @xmath55 . for @xmath164 , it even changes sign due to the presence of the nonlinearity .",
    "the values for our expressions for the line tension @xmath68 are either of the order of @xmath165 or slightly less , which is consistent with values reported in the literature @xcite . by considering variations of the parameter",
    "@xmath129 it can be inferred from tab .",
    "i that the line tension @xmath68 increases upon increasing the ionic strength @xmath128 .",
    "this is not in contradiction to the decrease of @xmath68 upon increasing @xmath128 close to a wetting transition , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite : in fact , in that study only contact angles of @xmath166 occurred , and the observed decrease of @xmath68 upon increasing the ionic strength @xmath128 has been found to become smaller for increasing contact angles ( fig .",
    "5(b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; in contrast , in the present study there are no wetting transitions and the contact angle is large , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "within the framework of nonlinear poisson - boltzmann theory , we have addressed the issue regarding the electrostatic interaction between a pair of identical , charged walls at distance @xmath66 , separated by two immiscible electrolyte solutions forming a flat interface ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "our numerical findings demonstrate that for small @xmath66 the linear theory overestimates all @xmath66-dependent contributions to the total electrostatic interaction by at least one order of magnitude ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "within the nonlinear theory the qualitative trends of the effective surface and line interaction potentials as functions of all system parameters have been discussed ( figs .  4 and 5 )",
    ". whereas the variations as functions of the degree @xmath55 of nonlinearity of the surface and interfacial contributions ( i.e. , the surface interaction energy , the surface tension , and the interfacial tension ) are only of a quantitative character , the line contributions ( line interaction energy and line tension ) show a qualitatively different behavior within the nonlinear theory as compared to the corresponding predictions of the linear theory ( figs .  2 , 4 , 5 and tab .",
    "i ) . for example , while the linear theory predicts a monotonically decreasing , attractive interaction between the two three - phase contact lines , nonlinearity changes it to a repulsive one at close separations which turns attractive at large distances @xmath66 ( figs .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "these differences between the linear and the nonlinear theory can not be explained by using , within the linear theory , a simple charge renormalization procedure ( fig .",
    "depending on the parameters , the line tension is found to change sign ( tab .",
    "i ) . moreover ,",
    "a dependence of the line interaction energy on the solvation properties of the two media ( described in terms of the donnan potential ) is present only within the nonlinear theory ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity is given by truncating the series expansion of the right - hand side of the poisson - boltzmann equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the ensuing results indicate that it is sufficient to consider only the first few terms in this series .",
    "the system we have studied is expected to mimic the situation of two colloidal particles being trapped very close to each other at a liquid interface . depending on the interaction among each other ,",
    "particles are known to form stable , unstable , or even mesostructures at a liquid interface @xcite . in the unstable situation , particles aggregate to form fractal structures .",
    "whereas for a stable monolayer to form , long - ranged interactions between the particles are required . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of fractal structures requires the total interaction potential to be short - ranged and characterized by a minimum at very short distances .",
    "accordingly , our findings are particularly relevant with respect to this aspect .",
    "thus , we expect our results for a pair of colloids to contribute towards a better understanding of the formation and stability of many - body colloidal monolayers trapped at fluid interfaces .",
