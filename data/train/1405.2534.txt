    "coupling resonant rf radiation to the spins of atoms in inhomogeneous magnetic fields allows to locally address clouds of ultracold atoms with high spatial resolution .",
    "this technique is commonly used in combination with atom chips , where it offers huge flexibility in the types of potentials that can be created @xcite .",
    "since the rf fields can also be time dependent , this technique offers the possibility to control the atoms dynamically and has , for example , been used to split bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . by today",
    "significant work has been done in the modelling of rf systems to create highly non trivial trapping geometries @xcite , including annular traps @xcite , examining effects beyond the rotating wave approximation @xcite and investigating non - linear zeeman effects @xcite .",
    "the use of multi - frequency fields has recently been suggested to create multi - well or even periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "these can also be time dependent and in @xcite a method to coherently control the centre of mass motion of both , a single atom and a cloud of interacting atoms , was suggested .",
    "while this work highlighted how versatile multi - frequency rf potentials are for experimentally realistic parameters , the theoretical model used could only describe limited tunnel coupling strengths between two potential wells , as it required all radio frequencies to be well separated . for large tunnel couplings , however , it is usually necessary to have potentials where the curvature can be controlled over short distances , which , using rf technology , requires two frequencies to be brought close . in such situations",
    "the effects of both frequencies have to be considered simultaneously and a more advanced model is necessary .    in this work",
    "we address the question of how to accurately deal with near degenerate frequencies and take full advantage of all degrees of freedom offered by rf fields by using floquet theory and comparing the results to the currently most common model @xcite .",
    "floquet theory allows to describe the interaction between a periodically oscillating field and a quantum system and its basic idea is to replace the semiclassical time - dependent hamiltonian with a time - independent hamiltonian of infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will show that this method allows to obtain highly accurate potentials .",
    "floquet theory is applicable to single and many - mode systems @xcite and it has been extensively used in studying multi - photon processes for atoms in strong laser fields @xcite .",
    "for example drese an holthaus @xcite used floquet theory to describe adiabatic potentials produced by short laser pulses in order to stimulate a stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) process .",
    "more recently this was extended to study multiphoton resonance dynamics driven by intense frequency - comb laser fields using many - mode floquet theory @xcite .",

    "this procedure will lead to an accumulation of errors and can suffer from a certain arbitrariness as the order of eliminating individual frequencies is not defined .",

    "this corresponds to limiting the order of the photonic processes that can occur , i.e.  if we limit the matrix to terms up to @xmath104 , maximally two photons can be absorbed and emitted . including higher orders will give a more accurate description , but usually these terms are quickly decreasing in magnitude . to first order , this then leads to    @xmath105    and diagonalising this matrix gives the quasi - energy spectrum , which in turn allows the adiabatic rf potential to be calculated .",
    "this process will be detailed in sec .",

    "the elements of the @xmath110 matrix are matrices themselves and @xmath110 can therefore be thought of as a composite matrix of two single frequency floquet matrices .",

    "the key points of the structure are that the bare trap eigenenergies are given along the diagonal and each floquet block differs by multiples of both @xmath58 and @xmath117 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms correspond to the coupling strengths and contain terms for @xmath111 and @xmath118    @xmath119",
    "in order to produce the adiabatic potential for the trapped atoms we need to extract the eigenvalues , @xmath120 , and eigenvectors , @xmath121 , from the floquet matrix for every position on the spatial numerical grid , @xmath122 .",
    "we do this numerically as producing analytic expressions becomes quickly unfeasible .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum has a periodic structure , which stems from the fact that the quasi eigenenenergies are defined mod @xmath58 and mod @xmath117 , and shows the expected avoided crossings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that the rabi frequencies @xmath123 and @xmath124 in this geometry are constant and can be changed independently from each other , which allows to control the size of the avoided crossings associated with each frequency separately .",

    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 in all cases . ]    the potential seen by the atoms can now be found by identifying the energy eigenvalue in the centre of the trap which is closest to the bare trap eigenenergy , @xmath127 ( normally the smallest positive quasi - eigenvalue ) , and following its evolution in space . to find the potential at the next numerical grid point @xmath128 ,",
    "we take the eigenvector @xmath129 associated with the eigenvalue at @xmath127 and calculate @xmath130 , the dot - product between it and all eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath131 .",
    "the index of the eigenvector which maximises this inner product gives the value of the potential at @xmath128 .",
    "iterating this process allows the construction of the potential along the whole length of the trap ( see red line in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] shows the adiabatic rf potentials generated using both the piecewise resonance and floquet methods for the same parameters as fig .",
    "[ fig : pwpotential ] .",
    "one can see that the floquet approach produces the same potential for ( a ) @xmath132 and avoids the discontinuity for ( b ) @xmath133 , which is a notable improvement over the piecewise resonant model .    in the extreme case of @xmath134 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ( c ) the floquet model produces another pair of avoided crossings on either side of the original avoided crossings seen at larger frequency spacing .",
    "these extra avoided crossings are the result of the frequencies no longer just coupling the local static field @xmath69 , where they are resonant . instead , at this very close frequency separation , each frequency",
    "is applied to the effective field created by the static field and the other frequency , which leads to a shift in the resonance position and results in the additional avoided crossings .",
    "as one can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ( c ) , these avoided crossings are not present in the piecewise resonance model , since the rotating wave approximation eliminates the higher order coupling terms .    .",
    "see text for discussion . ]    from this example it is clear that the floquet approach to modelling adiabatic rf potentials produces highly accurate results with significant corrections to the piecewise resonance approach .",
    "it is therefore well suited to accurately describe multi - frequency rf potentials created using closely spaced frequency . in the next section",
    "we will show how the floquet approach can be extend to systems with multiple rf fields where the orientations of the fields are not necessarily perpendicular to the static field .",
    "the well known flexibility of rf potentials stems from the large number of parameters ( number of frequencies , frequency spacing , field strength and orientation ) that can be controlled to modify the geometry of the potentials .",
    "these parameters can also be time - dependent , which allows to use the resulting potentials to instigate adiabatic or non - adiabatic dynamics . in the following we consider a multi - dimensional setup and use the floquet approach to describe some of the features which appear when taking these additional parameters into account .",
    "the main change necessary to extend the model to higher dimensions is to use a multi - dimensional static trapping field @xmath135 which then leads to coupling terms @xmath136 of the same , higher dimension .",
    "this means that the floquet matrix contains elements that are multidimensional , but its basic structure is unchanged from the one - dimensional case .",
    "the added dimension however means that the numerical processing power needed to diagonalise the floquet matrix is significantly higher .    in the following",
    "we will show an example of an interesting potential that can be created using just two frequencies .",
    "the numerical approach is similar to the one detailed above , in that we construct the 2d potentials by splitting them into 1d slices and combine them to produce the full 2d potential . to ensure that our minimum rotation method produces 1d slices which are consistent with each other , we use the previously generated 1d slice for each consecutive 1d slice to define an initial quasi - eigenvector and eigenvalue pair .",
    "two - dimensional rf potentials generated using one frequency have already been demonstrated to study rotating becs in annular geometries @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest ways to create a more involved structure using two frequencies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dpotential ] ( a ) where we consider a 2d ip trap and a constant rf field vector which contains a @xmath74 component only ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "one can see that the geometry one can create consists of an outer ring and an inner potential , which is actually simply the result from the one - dimensional model of sec .  [ sec : potentialgen ] rotated around the axis along z=0 .",
    "however , by controlling @xmath58 and @xmath59 one can easily change the depth and radius of the inner harmonic well and the outer ring , as well as the size and height of the barrier between them . performing such a change in a time - dependent way one",
