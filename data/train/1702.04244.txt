    "the origin of the present acceleration of the universe @xcite has not yet been known .",
    "one can attribute this acceleration to an exotic matter with negative pressure which permeates homogeneously the universe , dubbed as dark energy .",
    "a simple candidate for dark energy is a scalar field known as quintessence which nearly constitutes 70% of our present universe with density @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of the quintessence is negative and it dilutes less fast than dark and ordinary matter and radiation . today , dark energy density has the same order of magnitude as the sum of other universe ingredients , hence in the early eras its ratio density had to be negligible .",
    "`` why , nowadays , dark energy and dark matter densities have the same order of magnitude ? ''",
    "is known as the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "this can reexpressed as why the early time dark energy density was negligible .",
    "the present proportion of dark sectors can be explained by considering the possible interaction of dark energy with other components @xcite .",
    "known physical properties of theses components may give some clues to understand the behavior of dark energy .",
    "for example , quintessence ( dubbed also acceleron in neutrino dark energy models ) and neutrinos interaction , may be employed to relate neutrino masses to eos and the density of dark energy @xcite .",
    "this interaction makes the mass of neutrino being a function of the quintessence .",
    "hence the neutrino mass changes by evolution of the quintessence .",
    "the transition of mass varying neutrinos from relativistic to non - relativistic phase , deforms the effective potential such that the quintessence velocity reduces and it follows adiabatically the minimum of the convex effective potential , gives rise to the universe acceleration @xcite . in this model",
    "the quintessence effective mass is larger than the hubble parameter and , despite its interestingness , this scenario may suffer from instabilities which result in the formation of neutrino nuggets @xcite,@xcite .    in another class of models",
    "@xcite , to describe the screening effects , a coupling between quintessence and pressureless matter is considered such that when the density of matter becomes greater than a critical value , the @xmath0 symmetry of the effective potential is restored and the quintessence vacuum expectation vanishes resulting a zero fifth force .",
    "but in rare environment , the symmetry is broken and the quintessence evolves towards the minimum of its effective potential which may cause the universe acceleration .",
    "this occurs when , due to the redshift , the matter density becomes less than a critical value specified by the parameters of the model . in the symmetron model ,",
    "the mass of the quintessence is too large and therefore rolls rapidly toward the minimum of its effective potential and oscillates about it leading soon to a decelerating universe . to remedy this problem in @xcite ,",
    "the symmetron model was considered in the teleparallel model of gravity resulting in a de sitter attractor in the late time .    in this article , motivated by the mass varying neutrino and the symmetron",
    ", we introduce a coupled quintessence neutrino model in which the potential and the neutrino mass have @xmath0 symmetry . by the evolution of mass varying neutrinos from relativistic regime to the non - relativistic one",
    ", the shape of the effective potential changes and the quintessence begins its evolution from a constant initial fixed point .",
    "this procedure may provide enough _ positive _ potential to drive the cosmic acceleration via a slow roll evolution from a decelerated epoch with zero dark energy density .",
    "therefore it can alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "as the adiabaticity condition ( i. e. the quintessence traces adiabatically the minimum of the effective potential)is not used , the model is free from instabilities encountered in growing neutrino quintessence model @xcite . besides in contrast to the symmetron model @xcite , the universe can experience an accelerated phase during a time larger of the hubble time in the slow roll regime .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows : in the second section we study the possibility of occurrence of cosmic acceleration triggered by massive neutrinos in a symmetron like model from an epoch with zero dark energy density . in the third section",
    "the perturbation equations are obtained and the stability of the model is discussed .",
    "we illustrate our results with some numerical examples . in the last section",
    "we conclude the paper .    throughout this paper",
    "we use units @xmath2 and metric signature ( -,+,+,+ ) .",
    "we use the action @xcite @xmath3+\\sum_js_j\\left[a_j^2(\\phi)g_{\\mu \\nu},\\psi_j\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the homogenous quintessence with potential @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes other species .",
    "the coupling between the quintessence and @xmath6 is given by the conformal coupling @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "we consider only an interaction between @xmath9 and the quintessence , then @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the universe is taken as a spatially flat friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space time @xmath12 where @xmath13 being the scale factor .",
    "variation of ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to @xmath14 gives @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy density and the pressure of the ith species respectively and @xmath18 .",
    "variation of ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the metric yields the friedmann equation @xmath19 and the evolution of the hubble parameter is given by @xmath20 the universe is positively accelerated provided that , @xmath21 , which yields @xmath22 the continuity equations are given by @xmath23 for interacting ith species , and @xmath24 for other components .    by employing fermi - dirac distribution for neutrinos whose masses @xmath25 are @xmath14 dependent and are also in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28 . by using ( [ fd ] ) one",
    "finds @xmath29 therefore ( [ 5 ] ) is the same as the mass varying neutrino continuity equation provided that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a mass scale . for the quintessence",
    "we have @xmath32 where the effective potential is given by @xmath33 so we take the neutrinos interacting with quintessence via ( [ 1 ] ) as mass varying neutrinos . for different kinds of neutrinos with a same @xmath34 , we may still use ( [ 7.2 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , provided that we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "when interacting neutrinos are relativistic , @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "while for non - relativistic ones , @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 we can define a rescaled energy density @xmath42 as @xmath43 in terms of which ( [ 9 ] ) reduces to @xmath44 in the non relativistic case , we can write @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is neutrino density number . so we identify @xmath47 .",
    "the solution of the second equation in ( [ 11 ] ) is @xmath48 where `` 0 '' denotes present time where we take @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently @xmath50 , as expected . from (",
    "[ 11 ] ) , in the non relativistic limit we can define an effective quintessence potential @xmath51    now we can construct our model .",
    "we require    \\i ) initially , when massive neutrinos are nonrelativitic , quintessence energy density is negligible and the universe is in decelerated phase .",
    "\\ii ) the accelerated expansion of the universe is caused by symmetry breaking triggered by evolution of mass varying neutrinos from the relativistic regime toward the non relativistic one .    to choose appropriate @xmath5 and @xmath52 to fulfil ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , we proceed as follows :    we assume that @xmath5 and @xmath53 have @xmath0 symmetry and initially the quintessence stays at the minimum of its potential which we take : @xmath54 . whence dark energy density is negligible in this era @xmath55 to have an initial stable solution , we require that the potential be convex at this point @xmath56 .",
    "as neutrinos are initially relativistic : @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 .",
    "from ( [ 14 ] ) we find that the universe is in decelerated phase . in this era as",
    "@xmath14 is a constant , neutrino masses are also constant and the interaction in ( [ 7 ] ) is nonoperative . due to the universe expansion , neutrinos exit from relativistic phase such that @xmath59 , becomes significant @xmath60 .",
    "hence the effective potential given by ( [ 13 ] ) is no more equal to the quintessence potential . if we choose @xmath61 , whenever @xmath62 , the effective potential becomes concave and @xmath63 becomes an unstable point , the quintessence rolls down the effective potential and the @xmath0 symmetry breaks .",
    "as contrary to the the effective potential , the potential is convex , the quintessence climbs up its own potential .",
    "this can be achieved only when @xmath64 and @xmath65 have opposite signs . from ( [ 7.2 ] ) this implies that the signs of @xmath66 and @xmath65 are opposite too .",
    "this mechanism provides the positive potential required for cosmic acceleration ( see ( [ 14 ] ) ) .",
    "this scenario is completely different from the usual growing neutrino quintessence studied in the literature . in that scenario",
    "the interaction of neutrinos and quintessence , after the neutrinos become non - relativistic , acts as a barrier potential and stop the fast rolling of the quintessence forcing it to follow adiabatically the minimum of the effective potential giving rise to cosmic acceleration .",
    "this adiabaticity , which is absent in our model , gives rise to neutrino perturbation growing and neutrino nugget formation @xcite .",
    "our model is also different from the symmetron model where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the rescaled pressureless matter density . in the symmetron model , by dilution of matter density the quintessence becomes tachyonic and rolls down simultaneously its own and its effective potential @xcite .",
    "therefore the potential decreases by the symmetry breaking , and if it is initially negligible becomes negative after a while and can not drive the acceleration @xcite .",
    "so in the symmetron model the inial dark energy density is assumed to be not negligible @xmath69 .",
    "based on astrophysical data the eos of the quintessence , @xmath70 is estimated to be @xmath71 in the present epoch@xcite . so the kinetic energy of the quintessence must be much less than its potential .",
    "this is the slow roll condition @xmath72 from ( [ 11 ] ) we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the slow roll condition is satisfied when @xmath75 if @xmath76 or @xmath77 , ( [ 20 ] ) becomes @xmath78 if in the slow roll epoch ( like the present era ) , dark energy and other components densities have the same order of magnitude , by @xmath79 and ( [ 21 ] ) we obtain @xmath80    as a summary , in our formalism of cosmic acceleration , when the mass varying neutrinos become non relativistic their interaction with the quintessence becomes operative and triggers the quintessence evolution which augments the potential from its initial zero value .",
    "this positive potential is necessary to drive the cosmic acceleration .",
    "this mechanism provides a slow roll evolution provided that the effective potential sufficiently flat in the sense ( [ 22 ] ) .    to get more intuition about our model",
    "let us give an example .",
    "we choose the potential as a combination of cosmological constant and a gaussian type potential @xcite .",
    "we assume that mass of neutrinos has also a gaussian form @xcite .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants with inverse mass squared dimensions and @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the neutrino mass at @xmath86 .",
    "initially neutrinos are relativistic and @xmath39 . in this epoch",
    "@xmath86 is a stable solution ( as the potential is convex ) of equations of motion , yielding a zero dark energy density @xmath87 .",
    "when temperature decreases @xmath88 is not still negligible and @xmath89 when @xmath90 , the effective potential becomes concave at @xmath86 and this point becomes unstable and the quintessence , which gains a negative mass squared , rolls down the effective potential while climbs up its own potential ( since @xmath91 and @xmath65 have different signs ) .",
    "this holds whenever @xmath92 this mechanism provides the positive potential needed for the acceleration .    in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath93",
    ", we can ignore the pressure and the effective potential becomes @xmath94 and we can write ( [ 14.31 ] ) as @xmath95    when @xmath96 increases , @xmath97 holds and the potential behaves as a cosmological constant ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) at late time .",
    "we take this era as our present era and as based on astrophysical data , @xmath98 constitutes about 0.7 of our universe density , we can take @xmath99 .",
    "because of the exponential factors in ( [ 14.1 ] ) , the derivative of the effective potential satisfies ( [ 21 ] ) when @xmath100 and @xmath101 implying a slow roll motion with @xmath102",
    ". eventually by dilution of massive neutrinos , the effective potential becomes the same as the potential and the quintessence rolls down towards its initial point and oscillates around it .",
    "obtaining analytic solutions for equations of motions , even with simple potential and mass function , is very complicated if not impossible .",
    "so let us illustrate our results via a numerical example by using eqs.([3]),([4]),([6 ] ) , and ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the universe is nearly composed of massive neutrinos @xmath103 , the quintessence @xmath104 , the pressureless matter @xmath105 comprising cold dark matter and pressureless baryonic matter , and radiation @xmath106 .",
    "we choose the parameters of the model as @xmath107 .",
    "initial conditions are set at @xmath108 equivalent to the redshift @xmath109 in the nonrelativistic era as @xmath110 the relative density defined by @xmath111 at his initial point are @xmath112 and the hubble parameter is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the present hubble parameter at @xmath115 .    in fig.([fig1 ] ) , we have depicted the potential and the effective potential for @xmath116 .",
    "the potential is the same as the effective one in the relativistic limit . for nonrelativistic massing neutrinos",
    "the shape of the effective potential changes , and the previous minimum point becomes the new maximum .    in fig.([fig2 ] ) , the deceleration parameter , @xmath117 , is depicted showing the transition of the universe from a deceleration epoch to acceleration in a time of order of the hubble time .    .",
    "although this acceleration , which begins at the redshift @xmath118 , can last for some hubble times but is not persistent .",
    "gradually as the neutrinos density dilutes , the effective potential becomes the same as the potential and the quintessence rolls down to its initial position and oscillates about it .",
    "this can also be seen from fig.([fig3 ] ) .",
    "fig.([fig3])shows that the quintessence grows from @xmath86 and reaches to an approximately constant value , which is consistent with our previous discussion that when the effective potential becomes nearly flat , the slow roll evolution begins .    .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the eos parameter of the quintessence , @xmath119 , is plotted in fig.([fig4 ] ) , showing that @xmath120 decreases and @xmath121 during the time where the effective potential is nearly flat .",
    "finally in the future due the quintessence oscillation , @xmath119 will oscillate between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    in the present era @xmath124",
    "( corresponding to @xmath115 ) we find @xmath125 which is the range expected from planck 2015 data .",
    "the relative density defined by @xmath111 , are depicted in fig.([fig5 ] ) , showing that the dark energy density grows while other ingredients ratio densities decrease .",
    "@xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are the relative density of the pressureless matter , the mass varying neutrinos , the radiation , and the dark energy respectively .    .",
    "[ fig5 ]    note that we have chosen our initial condition at @xmath130 in the nonrelativistic regime while the quintessence began its motion in the semirelativistic limit , therefore @xmath131 while @xmath132 in the initial relativistic era . in this example , relative densities at the present era @xmath133 ( corresponding to @xmath115 ) are obtained as @xmath134 which lie in the expected region estimated by planck 2015 data .",
    "the mass varying neutrinos exit from the relativistic regime when @xmath135 . until this time we have @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the photons temperature .",
    "in addition we have @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the photons temperature at the present time . therefore @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the redshift when the mass varying neutrinos exit from the relativistic regime .",
    "therefore our initial conditions @xmath142 at @xmath143 is consistent with ( [ t3 ] ) .",
    "in this part we consider the evolution equations of perturbations in the nonrelativistic era , @xmath40 .",
    "we study the neutrino contrast with the same method used in @xcite . in the mass varying models of dark energy based on adiabaticity , the linear perturbations in this era grow and give rise to instability and formation of neutrinos nuggets @xcite .",
    "we first gather the required equations corresponding to our problem which are derived in @xcite then based on these equations , continue our discussion through a numerical illustrative example .",
    "the line element of perturbed flrw space - time can be written as @xmath144 where @xmath145 ( lapse function ) , @xmath146 ( shift function ) , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 are four scalar functions and a comma denotes a partial derivative .",
    "the stress tensor perturbations are given by @xmath149 by bar we denote the background value of a parameter and a prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "four velocities of the fluids are given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 have been used . going to the fourier space ,",
    "the evolutions equations for density fluctuations are derived as @xmath153 in which @xmath154 and @xmath155 for @xmath156 , this means that the interaction is considered only between the quintessence and massive neutrinos . from momentum conservation , the constraint @xmath157 is obtained .",
    "the evolution equation of the scalar field perturbation is @xmath158 by considering einstein equation , one derives @xmath159 from @xmath160 component , and @xmath161 from @xmath162 components , and @xmath163 by taking the trace of @xmath164 components .",
    "the trace free part of @xmath164 gives @xmath165 in which @xmath166 is the scalar shear .    in the following we choose the flat gauge @xmath167 .",
    "we assume that the universe is composed of the cold pressureless matter with @xmath168 ( baryonic+dark matter ) , the radiation with @xmath169 , the nonrelativistic massive neutrino with @xmath170 , and the quintessence .",
    "only interaction between the scalar field and the massive neutrinos is taken into the account .",
    "for the background we have @xmath171 for the densities , we obtain @xmath172 and for the velocities , @xmath173 , we derive @xmath174 the scalar field perturbation satisfies @xmath175 by using the components of the einstein equation we get @xmath176 and @xmath177    in models in which the coupling of neutrinos and quintessence acts as a potential barrier , and forces the quintessence to trace the minimum of its effective potential , neutrinos perturbations grow significantly in non relativistic regime where the adiabaticity condition is used . in our model the adiabatic condition does not hold , and instead we use the slow roll condition .",
    "so we expect that the model is still stable against linear perturbation @xcite .",
    "now let us show numerically this issue via the example ( [ 14.1 ] ) introduced in the previous section .    to numerically plot the perturbations we need also to know the initial conditions for fluid velocities , energy densities perturbations and perturbation of the scalar field . at @xmath108 ,",
    "we take @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the density contrast of the ith species .",
    "a same initial 3-velocity @xmath180 is assumed for all fluids .",
    "we have employed adiabatic initial conditions which implies @xmath181 initially @xcite .",
    "the parameters an initial conditions are taken the same as in the previous section , i.e , @xmath182 , and ( [ ic1 ] ) .    in fig.([fig6 ] ) and fig.([fig7 ] ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ p11])-([p16 ] ) , we depict @xmath145 and the massive neutrino density contrast respectively    as it is clear from fig.([fig7 ] ) , the neutrino perturbation does not grow critically .",
    "this is in contrast to the mass varying models of dark energy based on adiabaticity , where the linear perturbations in nonrelativistic era grow and give rise to instability and formation of neutrinos nuggets @xcite .",
    "inspired by neutrinos mass varying models , we propose a new possible model for onset of present cosmic acceleration .",
    "we assume that initially the quintessence is trapped in the minimum of its potential which has a @xmath0 symmetry . in this era , both the kinetic and potential energies of the quintessence are negligible .",
    "when the neutrinos exit from relativistic phase , due to their interaction with the quintessence , the shape of the effective potential changes and the initial stable point becomes unstable and the quintessence begins its motion . in contrary to the symmetron model , the effective potential and the potential have opposite slopes hence the quintessence climbs up its potential while rolls down the effective potential .",
    "this procedure provides enough energy to drive the cosmic acceleration via a slow roll evolution .",
    "however slow roll is not persistent and by dilution of massive neutrinos the quintessence roles back to its initial position and oscillates about it . in our scenario as we do nt employ the adiabaticity condition used in previous model of neutrino dark energy , we do nt expect to encounter instabilities arisen in those models .",
    "besides , as the initial value of dark energy density is negligible the coincidence problem may be alleviated .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> a new proposal for onset of cosmic acceleration based on mass varying neutrinos is proposed . when massive neutrinos become non relativistic , the @xmath0 symmetry is broken and the quintessence potential becomes positive from its initially zero value . </S>",
    "<S> this positive potential behaves like a cosmological constant at present time and drives the universe acceleration during the slow roll evolution of the quintessence . as in this context </S>",
    "<S> the nearly constant positive potential is switched on recently , the coincidence problem may be alleviated . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous models of dark energy with mass varying neutrinos , we do nt use the adiabaticity condition which leads to instability . </S>"
