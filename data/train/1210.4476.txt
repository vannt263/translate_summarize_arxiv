    "studies of the spatial distribution , metallicities , and kinematics of the globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way have provided us with fundamental insights into the formation and evolutionary history of our own galaxy ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 , zinn 1985 , armandroff & zinn 1988 , zinn 1993 , mackey & van den bergh 2005 ) .",
    "this link exists more generally as well : studies of gcs in other giant galaxies can provide us with clues to the host galaxies origins and structure .",
    "these luminous , old star clusters seem to mark the major star formation and merger episodes in galaxies ( e.g. , schweizer 1987 , whitmore et al .",
    "1993 , whitmore & schweizer 1995 , brodie & strader 2006 and references therein ) as well as acting as kinematic and dynamical tracers of the outer regions of galaxies , which are difficult to probe via integrated light ( e.g. , zepf et al .",

    "steady progress has been made in our understanding of extragalactic gc systems in the @xmath920 years since harris 1991 comprehensive annual review of gc systems in galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "many of the major advances in extragalactic gc system research were made possible by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) : for example , hst has enabled systematic surveys of the gc systems of hundreds of galaxies in the ( relatively nearby ) virgo and fornax clusters ( ct et al .",
    "2004 , jordn et al . 2007 ) as well as detection of gcs in galaxy clusters @xmath7100  mpc away ( e.g. , west et al . 2011 ) .",
    "nevertheless one of the deficiencies pointed out in both the book on globular cluster systems by ashman & zepf ( 1998 ) and the annual review by brodie & strader ( 2006 ) is the relative rarity of wide - field ccd studies that are able to measure accurate global properties of giant galaxy gc populations .",
    "reliable measurements of quantities like the spatial distribution of the gc system , the total number of gcs , the gc specific frequency , and the global color distribution require wide - field ccd imaging in multiple filters .",
    "a ccd camera with a field - of - view ( fov ) many arc  minutes on a side is needed to cover the full radial extent of the gc systems of galaxies within @xmath920@xmath1030  mpc and accurate multi - color photometry is crucial for minimizing contamination from non - gcs ( e.g. , rhode & zepf 2001 , dirsch et al .",
    "our group is engaged in an ongoing survey aimed at quantifying the global properties of the gc populations of giant galaxies .",
    "we use multi - color imaging with mosaic ccd cameras and target giant spiral , s0 , and elliptical galaxies at distances between @xmath910@xmath1025  mpc .",
    "to date we have observed @xmath730 giant galaxies with a range of masses , morphological types , and luminosities ; results for the galaxies we have finished analyzing are published in a series of papers ( rhode & zepf 2001 , 2003 , 2004 ; rhode et al .",

    "other groups who use multi - color wide - field imaging techniques have for the most part targeted massive elliptical galaxies with very populous , extended gc systems ( e.g. , dirsch et al .  2003 , imaging of ngc  1399 ; tamura et al .",
    "2006 , imaging of m87 ; dirsch et al .",
    "2005 , imaging of ngc  4636 ) .",
    "we have recently observed a number of moderate - luminosity spiral and s0 galaxies in order to fill in specific gaps in our survey and in the general census of giant galaxies that have been imaged with wide - field ccd cameras .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies are a good match , in terms of their observational requirements , for the fov and sensitivity of the wiyn 3.5-m telescope and minimosaic imager .    in this paper we present results from wiyn minimosaic imaging of the gc populations of four moderate - luminosity spiral and lenticular galaxies : the sb0 galaxy ngc  1023 , the sbb galaxy ngc  1055 , and the isolated s0/sbc galaxy pair ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 . basic properties of the four galaxies  morphological type , distance , absolute magnitude , stellar mass , and environment  are listed in table  [ table : galstats ] .",
    "the gc systems of two of the galaxies , ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 , were studied by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , so we have combined their previous results with our wide - field data to produce the full gc system radial distributions for those two galaxies .",
    "also included in our wiyn imaging of ngc  1023 is the magellanic dwarf galaxy ngc  1023a , so we identify a subsample of gc candidates that may be associated with ngc  1023a and estimate this galaxy s total gc population and specific frequency .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "the next two sections describe the data acquisition and image reductions ( section  [ section : reductions ] ) and the detection and selection of gc candidates around each galaxy ( section  [ section : detection ] ) . section [ section : analysis2 ] addresses the issues of completeness and contamination in the gc candidate samples .",
    "the results of the analysis  including the radial profiles of each galaxy s gc system , the total number and specific frequency of gcs , and analysis of the gc color distributions  are presented in section  [ section : results ] .",
    "the last section of the paper gives a brief summary of the main conclusions .",
    "images of the target galaxies were obtained in september 2008 and september 2009 at kitt peak national observatory with the 3.5  m wiyn telescope and minimosaic camera .",
    "the detector is comprised of two 2048 @xmath11 4096 ccds with 0.141@xmath12  pixels , and a fov of 9.6@xmath13  @xmath11 9.6@xmath13  when paired with the wiyn telescope .",
    "the relatively large fov allowed us to image the isolated galaxy pair ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 simultaneously . to obtain sufficient radial coverage of these galaxies gc systems , ngc",
    "7339 was positioned near the top center of the field , while ngc  7332 was placed in the lower right .",
    "ngc  1023 and 1055 were both positioned in the center of one ccd ( away from a narrow gap between the two minimosaic ccds ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : n1023 finder]-[fig : n7332 finder ] show the wiyn fov for each target galaxy overlaid on a digitized sky survey ( dss )   image . to help us differentiate gcs from contaminating foreground stars and background galaxies ,",
    "multiple exposures were taken in each of three broadband filters ( @xmath0 ) . for a list of exposure times see table  [ table : observations ] .",
    "observations of photometric standard star fields @xcite were made in photometric conditions throughout the first night of the 2008 observing run and the third night of the 2009 run , along with at least one exposure of each target galaxy in all three filters .",
    "these observations were used to determine the color terms and zero point constants for the data taken on the photometric nights .",
    "the calculated errors on the zero point constants were all less than or equal to 0.007 magnitude , which demonstrates that those nights were genuinely photometric .",
    "standard reductions ( overscan and bias level subtraction , flat - field division ) were performed on all of the minimosaic images using tasks in the iraf package mscred .",
    "the mscred tasks _ msczero _ , _ msccmatch _ , and _ mscimage _ were then used to convert the multi - extension fits images into single - extension images .",
    "the images taken of a given target galaxy were aligned to each other .",
    "a constant sky background level was measured for each image and subtracted .",
    "images of a given galaxy taken in the same filter were then scaled to a common flux level and combined using the iraf task _ imcombine _ and the _ ccdclip _ pixel rejection algorithm .",
    "the constant sky background level was then added back to the final combined image .",
    "the result of this processing was a single deep , stacked image of each target galaxy in each filter .",
    "the mean full - width at half - maximum of the point - spread function ( fwhm psf ) in the combined @xmath0 images ranged from @xmath14 for ngc  1023 , @xmath15 for ngc  7332 & ngc  7339 , and @xmath16 for ngc  1055 .",
    "the method we used for calibrating the photometry in the final stacked images ( using the data taken on the photometric nights of the 2008 and 2009 runs ) is explained in section  [ section : photometry ] .",
    "to facilitate detection of gc candidates close to each target galaxy , we executed a series of steps to remove the diffuse galaxy light from the deep , stacked images .",
    "we began by smoothing each of the images with a circular median filter with a diameter 7@xmath107.5 times the mean fwhm psf of the image .",
    "the size of the median filter was chosen after testing to find the optimal size for removing diffuse light from the galaxy while preserving the psf of the compact , star - like objects around the galaxy .",
    "this smoothed image was then subtracted from the original version .",
    "a constant background level was added to the resultant images to preserve the photometric integrity of later measurements .",
    "the rest of the analysis steps were performed on these `` galaxy - subtracted '' images ( one such image for each filter and each galaxy field ) .",
    "some regions of the galaxy - subtracted images  such as small areas around saturated stars and high - background areas in the galaxy disks  were masked out prior to the detection step in order to minimize spurious detections .",
    "the iraf task _ daofind _ was then used to identify sources above a given signal - to - noise threshold in each image .",
    "the source lists for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 filters were matched , and only sources that appeared in all three filters were retained in the final list of detected objects for a particular galaxy field . for ngc  7332 & ngc  7339",
    "a total of 1126 objects appeared in all three filters , while ngc  1055 had 343 matched objects and ngc  1023 had 2141 matched objects .",
    "the relatively small numbers of objects found in the ngc  1055 field compared to the other two fields had two causes .",
    "first , ngc  1055 has a higher galactic latitude than the other galaxy fields  its latitude is @xmath20 @xmath2 @xmath1051  degrees , compared to @xmath20 @xmath2 @xmath1019  degrees for ngc  1023 and @xmath20 @xmath2 @xmath1029 degrees for ngc  7332  so many fewer galactic foreground stars appear in the ngc  1055 field .",
    "secondly , ngc  1055 is an sb spiral galaxy , whereas ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 are s0 galaxies ; we are finding in our gc system survey that spiral galaxies typically have many fewer gc candidates around them than early - type galaxies .",
    "given the distances to the target galaxies ( @xmath910@xmath1020  mpc ; see table  [ table : galstats ] ) , gcs should appear as unresolved point sources in our ground - based images .",
    "the median half - light radius for milky way gcs is 3  pc @xcite , which subtends 0.06@xmath12  at 10  mpc , and our images have fwhm psf values of 0.6@xmath101.1@xmath12 .",
    "thus any extended objects are not real gcs and need to be removed from the source lists . to accomplish this",
    ", we plotted the fwhm of the detected objects against instrumental magnitude ( separately for each galaxy field and for each filter ) .",
    "in such a diagram , point sources produce a tight grouping that flares at faint magnitudes .",
    "sources that deviated markedly from this sequence in any of the three filters were eliminated from the source list .",
    "our extended source cut for ngc  1023 is illustrated in figure [ fig:1023magvfwhm ] ; a similar cut was applied to all three target fields .",
    "once the extended objects were removed , the source list for ngc  1023 contained 917 objects .",
    "the source list for ngc  1055 included 257 objects , and the list for ngc  7332/ngc  7339 had 642 objects .",
    "calibrated @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 magnitudes for the matched list of point sources in each galaxy field were derived using the following procedure .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the point sources in each field ( i.e. , the 917 sources in the ngc  1023 field , the 257 objects in the ngc  1055 field , and the 642 objects in the ngc  7332/ngc  7339 field ) using the iraf task phot .",
    "the radii of the apertures used to do the photometry were set equal to the mean fwhm value of the image .",
    "an aperture correction was derived for each image by calculating the mean of the difference between the total magnitude and the magnitude measured within a one - fwhm - radius aperture for a set of @xmath910@xmath1020 bright point sources .",
    "in addition to the aperture correction , a bootstrap correction was determined for calibrating our stacked images , which are a combination of images taken on both photometric and non - photometric nights . to calculate the bootstrap correction ,",
    "instrumental magnitudes of bright objects were compared between single - frame images taken on photometric nights and the final stacked images of a given target field .",
    "the mean magnitude difference between the single photometric image and the final , combined image was calculated for each case .",
    "we also determined foreground galactic extinction corrections ( in the direction of each target galaxy field ) from the maps of infrared dust emission presented in @xcite .",
    "total instrumental magnitudes were calculated for the matched point sources by applying the appropriate aperture , bootstrap , and airmass corrections to the instrumental magnitudes measured with the one - fwhm - radius aperture .",
    "these magnitudes were then calibrated using the appropriate photometric coefficients and galactic extinction corrections , to produce final @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 magnitudes and colors for the point sources .      in the final gc candidate selection step , we establish an expected range of @xmath0 magnitudes and colors for gcs at the target galaxies distances and keep only the objects that are consistent with those values .",
    "the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) of the milky way and other giant galaxies indicates that the most luminous gcs will typically have @xmath24 @xmath9 @xmath1011 @xcite . for ngc  1055",
    ", we eliminated point sources with @xmath24 brighter than @xmath1011 ( assuming the distance modulus given in table [ table : galstats ] ) .",
    "for ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 , there were three point sources that were close to the host galaxies , looked like gcs , and had @xmath24 values a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than @xmath1011 .",
    "we relaxed the bright - end magnitude criterion slightly in order to include only these three specific objects . in the case of ngc  1023 , we adjusted our bright - end cut to include a luminous , spectroscopically - confirmed gc originally identified by @xcite .",
    "relaxing the bright - magnitude criterion yielded an extra seven objects around ngc  1023 that have gc - like colors and @xmath24 magnitudes brighter than @xmath1011 .",
    "the sequence numbers , positions , @xmath18 magnitudes , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 colors and corresponding errors for these seven objects are given in table  [ table : n1023 bright objects ] .",
    "given our assumed distance modulus for ngc  1023 ( @xmath27@xmath230.29 ) , the @xmath24 values for these seven objects range from @xmath1011.4 to @xmath1011.0 .",
    "( we note that two of the objects , 119 and 133 , are located several arc  minutes away from the galaxy center and thus would seem less likely than the objects at small projected radial distances to be bona fide gcs . ) for the ngc  7332/7339 field we also implemented a faint source cut , eliminating objects with @xmath28 .",
    "we did this to remove a number of faint objects that had large magnitude errors ( @xmath290.15 ) and were located many arc  minutes from the target galaxy ; these are likely to be unresolved background galaxies . for similar reasons a faint cut of @xmath30",
    "was implemented for both the ngc  1023 and ngc  1055 fields .",
    "( note that any gcs we miss due to the magnitude incompleteness of our images and the cuts imposed on the samples at the faint end are accounted for in the gclf correction step described in section  [ section : gclf ] . )",
    "we also implemented the standard @xmath0 color selection that we use for the wide - field survey ( see @xcite for more details ) : we removed point sources that lie more than @xmath31 away from the mean @xmath26 vs.  @xmath25 relation for galactic gcs with metallicities between [ fe / h ] of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when we test whether each source is consistent within @xmath31 of the milky way gc color - color relation , we take into account the object s photometric error .",
    "for ngc  7332 we added a single object that fell just barely outside the color criteria and was located close ( @xmath34@xmath13 ) to the galaxy center .",
    "gc candidates positioned very close to the host galaxy disk may be subject to additional reddening and thus might appear in the @xmath0 color - color diagram just redward of the gc candidate selection box .",
    "point sources that appeared in this part of the color - color diagram were individually examined in the images .",
    "for all four of the target galaxies , none of the objects just redward of the color selection box were positioned close to the host galaxy disk in the images , so we did not add any such candidates to our final list .",
    "an additional complicating factor in the detection of gc candidates around ngc  1023 was the presence of the dwarf galaxy ngc  1023a .",
    "the galaxy is classified as a magellanic irregular in rc3 @xcite and is located @xmath92.5@xmath13  ( a projected distance of @xmath98  kpc ) to the southeast of ngc  1023 in the image .",
    "according to the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , ngc  1023a is a member of the ngc  1023 group .",
    "we determined that the light from ngc  1023a extends over a circular region with a radius of 0.6@xmath13  in the @xmath18-band image .",
    "we did this by plotting the pixel intensities along the radial direction between ngc  1023a and ngc  1023 to find the radial distance at which the light from ngc  1023a begins to dominate .",
    "we measured this radial distance in all three of the combined images and averaged the results to come up with the radial size of ngc  1023a in the images .",
    "we excluded this region from the rest of our analysis of ngc  1023 s gc system .",
    "eight of the point sources with magnitudes and colors like gcs are located within that circular region .",
    "we note that , without additional information , we can not definitively say with which galaxy these objects are associated .",
    "we explore the properties of these eight objects in further depth in section [ section : dwarf ] , including estimating how many of them are likely to be gcs in the dwarf galaxy ( rather than part of ngc  1023 s gc system ) .",
    "we correct for the area that was masked around ngc  1023a when we construct the radial profile for ngc  1023 s gc system ( see section [ section : radial profile ] ) .",
    "the final gc candidate list for ngc  1023 contained 192 objects , while ngc  1055 had 60 gc candidates and ngc  7732 and ngc  7339 together had 105 gc candidates .",
    "figures [ fig:1023 color - color ]  [ fig:7332 color - color ] show the @xmath0 color - color diagrams for the point sources detected around the four galaxies .",
    "open squares represent the detected point sources , and the filled circles show the objects that were selected for the final gc candidate list .",
    "the gc color selection box and the mean @xmath26 vs.  @xmath25 relation for milky way gcs ( the line marking the midpoint of the box ) are marked with solid lines .",
    "the tracks indicate the expected colors for galaxies of different morphological types at redshifts between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , to illustrate possible sources of background galaxy contamination ; i.e. , to show what types of galaxies , and at what redshifts , are likely to lie in the same part of the @xmath0 color - color plane as gcs .",
    "( see rz01 for a full discussion of how the color cut for the survey was developed and details about how these galaxy tracks were produced . )",
    "in order to determine the limit of our ability to detect point sources of a given magnitude in the galaxy - subtracted images , we created a series of tests to quantify the completeness level as a function of object magnitude in each filter for each galaxy field .",
    "we first measured the typical psf for each image .",
    "we added 200 artificial point sources with the appropriate psf and a given magnitude to each of the combined images ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "we did this in 0.2-magnitude steps over a range of 6@xmath107 magnitudes , creating a separate image for each magnitude step ( and each filter ) .",
    "the images with the artificial point sources were then processed in a series of steps identical to the detection steps we had executed to find gc candidates in the original images . for each magnitude step and each filter , we determined what fraction of the artificial sources were recovered .",
    "this gave us an estimate of the completeness at that magnitude , i.e. , our ability to detect point sources of a given magnitude in a given image .",
    "the result was a series of completeness curves , one for each filter , for each set of galaxy - subtracted combined images .",
    "the completeness information was taken into account in our analysis of what fraction of the gc luminosity function we had covered for each galaxy ( see section  [ section : gclf ] ) .",
    "the 50% completeness limits are typically @xmath37-@xmath38 magnitudes ; table [ table : completeness ] lists the exact values for each image .",
    "contamination of the gc candidate lists by foreground stars and background compact galaxies occurs because some of these objects may match all of the selection criteria for gc candidates . here",
    "we present our methods for quantifying the contamination level and , where possible , correcting for the presence of contaminating objects .",
    "we used a galactic stellar population synthesis model to estimate the level of stellar foreground contamination that might be present in the gc candidate lists .",
    "hereafter we refer to the model as the besanon model ; a complete description of the model and the observational constraints used to develop it are given in @xcite . briefly",
    ", the model divides the milky way galaxy into four distinct stellar populations : a thin disk , a thick disk , a spheroid , and a bulge .",
    "each component is defined by a star formation rate , initial mass function , metallicity distribution , kinematics , and evolutionary tracks within the model . given a range of stellar types , magnitudes , and colors , the model uses monte carlo methods to produce galactic star counts for a specific region of the sky .",
    "comparisons of the star count predictions of the besanon model to photometric surveys have shown reasonable agreement ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we used the besanon model to estimate the number of galactic foreground stars that would appear within the fields of view of our minimosaic pointings . in order to arrive at an estimate of the number of possible contaminants in the gc candidate samples , we set the inputs of the model to provide counts only for galactic stars with @xmath25 colors , @xmath26 colors , and @xmath18 magnitudes defined by the range of properties in the final selected gc candidate list for each galaxy . to account for the statistical nature of the model",
    ", we ran it ten times per target galaxy field and then calculated the mean galactic star counts in each case .",
    "we then used this number and the fov of the minimosaic images to compute the surface density of contaminating galactic stars for the galaxy field .",
    "the contamination was estimated to be 0.15  arcmin@xmath39 for ngc  1055 .",
    "ngc  1023 has an estimated foreground contamination of 0.56  arcmin@xmath39 , while the field for ngc  7332 and 7339 has an estimated foreground contamination of 0.54  arcmin@xmath39 . as noted in the discussion of source detection ( section  [ section : detection ] ) , the relatively low level of foreground stellar contamination for ngc  1055 compared to the other target galaxies",
    "is expected because of its relatively high galactic latitude .",
    "another way to evaluate the level of contamination in the wiyn data is by examining archival hst images  .",
    "many compact background galaxies that appear as point sources in ground - based imaging may be resolved by hst , so determining whether some of the wiyn gc candidates are actually extended objects can help us assess how much background galaxy contamination is present in the wiyn gc candidate lists .",
    "accordingly , we analyzed hst archival data for ngc  7332 & ngc  7339 to determine if any of the wiyn gc candidates were background galaxies .",
    "we found one wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) image in the hubble legacy archive ( hla ) that was taken in an appropriate broadband filter ( f606w ) and had sufficient depth ( a combination of three exposures totaling 1500 seconds ) for detecting our gc candidates .",
    "the wfpc2 pointing ( hst proposal i d 7566 , pi : green ) was @xmath92.5@xmath13  from the center of ngc  7339 .",
    "the footprint of the wfpc2 pointing is marked with a solid line in figure  [ fig : n7332 finder ] .",
    "five of the wiyn gc candidates lie within the wfpc2 fov .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on these sources in the hst images , using apertures with radii of 0.5 and 3.0 pixels .",
    "the ratio of counts in the larger aperture to the smaller aperture is expected to be @xmath40 12 for compact objects on the pc chip and @xmath40 8 for compact objects on the wf chip @xcite .",
    "all five of the wiyn gc candidates had count ratios in the wfpc2 images consistent with their being point sources .",
    "it is important to note here that this is not necessarily indicative of zero background contamination from background galaxies ( since only five of the wiyn gc candidates appear in the wfpc2 pointing ) , but it may indicate at least that the wiyn candidate sample is unlikely to be dominated by background objects .    for ngc  1023 , there were four archival images of sufficient depth ( each a combination of two exposures totaling 2400 seconds ) and taken in useful filters ( f555w and f814w ) in the hla that we could use to assess our background galaxy contamination level .",
    "the hst images included two slightly overlapping wfpc2 pointings near the galaxy center from hst proposal i d 6554 ( pi : brodie ) .",
    "the wfpc2 footprints are marked in figure  [ fig : n1023 finder ] .",
    "twenty of our wiyn gc candidates were identified in both filters , and of those , two had count ratios indicating they were extended objects .",
    "this again seems to suggest that the wiyn gc candidate samples are not dominated by contamination from background galaxies .",
    "we did not remove these objects from our candidate list at this stage , since the presence of contaminants was dealt with by the application of the overall contamination correction ( section [ section : asymptotic ] ) . manually removing only a select",
    "few contaminating objects at this point in the analysis would effectively result in a double correction and an incorrect result for the derived gc system radial profile .",
    "these two objects were , however , excluded during the color distribution ( section [ section : tblue ] ) analysis step , where the measured properties of individual objects plays a role .",
    "there are currently no images of ngc  1055 in the hst archive .",
    "thus we could not do this type of analysis for the ngc  1055 field and gc candidate list .",
    "since the gc population is expected to fall off with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy , we assume that beyond some point the gc candidate sample will be dominated by contaminating objects ( compact objects with magnitudes and colors like gcs , which are actually stars or background galaxies ) . at large projected radii",
    "the radial distribution of gc candidates should flatten to some constant value ; the surface density in the outermost portion of the radial profile thus provides us with an estimate of the surface density of contaminants .",
    "we refer to this estimate as the `` asymptotic contamination correction '' .",
    "to investigate the radial distribution of each galaxy s gc system as well as to determine the asymptotic contamination correction , we assigned the gc candidates to one of a series of circular annuli extending outward from the galaxy center .",
    "the annuli sizes we used to create this initial radial profile for each galaxy varied between 0.5 wide to 0.8 wide , depending on how many gc candidates appeared around the galaxy and how the candidates were distributed . for each annulus",
    ", we calculated a corresponding `` effective area '' , equal to the area of the annulus minus any area in which gc candidates could not be detected ( e.g. , masked or saturated regions , or parts of the annuli that extended off the edges of the images ) .",
    "we then calculated the surface density of gc candidates ( number per effective area ) in each annulus , and plotted this quantity versus the mean projected radius of the corresponding annuli .",
    "for the gc system of ngc  1055 , we found that the surface density of gc candidates converged to a fairly constant value and remained flat in the annuli with mean radii greater than 4.7@xmath13 . taking the weighted mean of the surface density in the annuli beyond this point",
    ", we find a contamination value of @xmath41 objects  arcmin@xmath39 .",
    "for ngc  1023 , the profile converged to a relatively constant level at radii beyond 6.7@xmath13 ; the weighted mean surface density in these outer annuli is @xmath42 objects  arcmin@xmath39 .",
    "ngc  7332 & ngc  7339 appear on the sky near to each other ( @xmath40 6@xmath13  separation ) , although they are not thought to be interacting @xcite .",
    "the proximity of these galaxies in the minimosaic pointing complicated our efforts to determine an asymptotic contamination correction . both galaxies showed a gc surface density that decreased with increasing radius in the first few annuli of the profile , but then increased again due to the presence of the neighboring galaxy s gc system ( i.e. , the gc surface density around ngc  7332 dropped with radius in the first few arc  minutes around the galaxy , but then increased in the region around ngc  7339 , and vice versa ) . to remedy this , we noted the approximate radius at which the gc population around each galaxy fell to a constant level , and then placed a circular mask with that radius over the galaxy and its gc system . for both galaxies ,",
    "a circular region with radius 1.8@xmath13  ( @xmath912  kpc ) was sufficient to mask out the gc population .",
    "we used the image with both masks in place to determine the asymptotic contamination correction for the entire field .",
    "because ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 appear in the same wiyn pointing and we used a single set of gc candidate selection techniques for the @xmath0 images of that field , the surface density of contaminants that we apply should be the same for the two galaxies .",
    "combining their asymptotic contamination corrections yields a weighted average contamination value of @xmath43 objects  arcmin@xmath39 .",
    "the last step in this process was to take the appropriate asymptotic contamination correction for each galaxy and multiply it by the effective area of each annulus in the radial profiles .",
    "this provides us with an estimate of the number of contaminating objects in each radial bin of each galaxies gc system profile .",
    "the _ fraction _ of contaminating objects in each annulus is the number of contaminating objects divided by the number of gc candidates .",
    "this provides us with a radially - dependent contamination correction that we can use in subsequent analysis steps .",
    "we note that for all of the galaxies , the contamination level determined from the asymptotic behavior of the radial profile is larger than the level calculated from the galactic star count models .",
    "this is a useful consistency check ; we expect that the contamination in our gc candidate samples will come from both compact background galaxies and foreground galactic stars , so the total number density of contaminants should be larger than the number density from the galactic stellar population models ( in the limit that the model results are accurate ) .",
    "we used the list of gc candidates for each galaxy to create a luminosity function ( lf )  a histogram of the number of gc candidates in a series of @xmath18 magnitude intervals  for that galaxy s gc system . the radially - dependent contamination correction described in section [ section : asymptotic ]",
    "provides us with an estimated contamination fraction for each annulus in the radial profile , so we used it to correct the lf data .",
    "if a gc candidate was located , for example , in an annulus that had a contamination fraction of 15% , then 0.85 was added to the number of objects in the appropriate @xmath18 magnitude bin of the lf histogram .",
    "we then divided each magnitude bin by its completeness correction ( section  [ section : completeness ] ) , yielding a final corrected gclf . because we require that the gc candidates must be detected in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 images , the completeness correction we apply takes into account the detection limits in all three filters ( specifically , by convolving the completeness level in each filter at each @xmath18 magnitude bin ; see rz01 for additional details ) .",
    "we can not reliably determine the exact shape of the gclf for these galaxies based on our data , because either we have insufficient numbers of gc candidates in the samples or we do not follow the luminosity function far enough past the peak of the gclf , or both . therefore to fit the gclf and determine how many gcs we may have missed , we assume that the intrinsic gc luminosity function is a gaussian function similar to that of the milky way gc system , which has a peak magnitude at @xmath44 and a dispersion of 1.23 @xcite .",
    "given the distances in table  [ table : galstats ] , we calculated the peak apparent magnitude for the gclf of our galaxies , and fitted gaussians with that peak and dispersions of 1.2 , 1.3 , and 1.4 magnitude to the lf data .",
    "we allowed the amplitude of this theoretical gclf to vary and calculated the fraction of the total area of the best - fitting theoretical gclf that was covered by our observed lf data .",
    "the size and starting position of the lf magnitude bins were also varied to investigate the effect on the calculated gclf coverage ; the resulting differences were included in our error calculations in section [ section : spec freq ] . the observed gclf data and best - fitting gaussian functions four the four target galaxies are plotted in figure  [ fig : gclf ] .",
    "the shaded histogram is the observed , contamination - corrected luminosity function of the gc candidates and the solid - line historgram is those same data corrected for the final convolved @xmath0 completeness .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian functions for three different dispersions are shown as indicated in the figure legend .",
    "table [ table : gclf ] lists the mean calculated gclf coverage for each galaxy . for ngc  1055 , ngc  7332 , and ngc  7339 , we detect about one - third of the gc population given the magnitude depth and detection limits of our data ; for ngc  1023 , which has a distance that is significantly closer than the other three galaxies , we cover about 60% of the theoretical gclf .",
    "as mentioned in the explanation of the asymptotic contamination correction ( section  [ section : asymptotic ] ) , a radial profile for the gc system of each galaxy was constructed by first assigning each gc candidate to one of a series of concentric circular annuli starting from the center of the host galaxy and continuing out to the edges of the images .",
    "after some experimentation with various radial profile bin sizes , we settled on annuli corresponding to approximately 3  kpc in physical size at the distance of each galaxy .",
    "accordingly , the circular annuli used to create the radial profile for ngc  1023 were 0.8@xmath13  wide , the ngc  1055 annuli were 0.8@xmath13  wide , and for ngc  7332 0.5@xmath13-wide annuli were used . for ngc  7339",
    "the gc system is extremely compact around the galaxy , extending to only @xmath91@xmath13  from the galaxy center .",
    "this necessitated the use of a more granular radial bin size ( 0.3@xmath13 ) to obtain more measurements at the cost of an increase in the relative error .",
    "each annulus was corrected for missing areal coverage due to parts of the annuli being masked or extending off the edges of the images .",
    "the surface density of contaminants , as determined from the asymptotic behavior of the radial profile ( section [ section : asymptotic ] ) , was multiplied by the effective area of each concentric annulus to yield the number of contaminants for that annulus . after correcting the total number of gc candidates in each annulus for contamination",
    ", we applied the appropriate gclf correction , then divided by the effective area of the annulus to yield the surface density of gcs in each annulus .",
    "the error on the surface density includes poisson errors on the number of gcs and the number of contaminating objects .",
    "we calculated the mean distance of all unmasked pixels in each annulus , and used this as the radial distance of each annulus in the radial profile .",
    "the final , corrected radial profile data for the gc systems of the four galaxies are listed in tables [ table:1023radprof ] through [ table:7339radprof ] . for each projected radial distance ,",
    "a surface density and error are listed . in the case of ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 , we supplemented our wiyn data with data from previously - published studies of the gc populations to generate additional points in the gc system radial distributions",
    ". therefore the radial profile tables for these galaxies also list the source of the measurement in the last column .",
    "( more details on the supplementary data are given in the next section . )",
    "the final radial profiles are plotted in figures [ fig:1023 radial profile ] through [ fig:7339 radial profile ] .",
    "the top plot in each figure shows the gc surface density versus projected radius , while the bottom plot shows the log of the gc surface density versus the log of the projected radius .",
    "we fitted both a de  vaucouleurs law ( of the form @xmath45 ) and a power law ( of the form @xmath46 ) to each radial profile .",
    "here , @xmath47 is the surface density of gcs in number per square arc minute and @xmath48 is the projected radius in arc  minutes . the slope , intercept , and reduced @xmath49 value corresponding to the best - fitting power law and de  vaucouleurs law functions are given in table [ table : fitting ] .",
    "both functions are shown in the bottom plots of the radial profile figures but the function with the lowest reduced @xmath49 value was the one used in subsequent analysis steps ( see section  [ section : totaln ] ) .",
    "the power law is the best - fitting function for the radial profiles of the gc systems of ngc  1055 and ngc  7339 .",
    "this is also the case for ngc  7332 , although the data points in the profile ( fig.[fig:7332 radial profile ] ) fall below the power law at large radius .",
    "ngc  1023 is best fit by a de  vaucouleurs profile . in this case , the points in the inner radial profile fluctuate between low and high values ; the reasons for this are explored in the next section .",
    "the radial distribution of the gc system in the final corrected profile falls to zero surface density ( and remains at zero in adjacent bins ) within the calculated errors for each of the target galaxies .",
    "we define the center of this radial bin as the radial extent of the gc system for that galaxy . for ngc  1023 , this occurs in the radial bin centered at 6.3@xmath13  and for ngc  1055 at 5.5@xmath13 . the gc system radial profiles of ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 drop to zero surface density within the errors in the 2.0@xmath13  and 1.5@xmath13  annuli , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to transform the radial extent of each galaxies gc system into physical units of distance .",
    "we calculate this value by combining the radial extents determined above with the distance moduli listed in table [ table : galstats ] .",
    "the errors on the extent values are calculated for each case by combining the uncertainty in the galaxy distance modulus with an error equal to one bin width in the gc system radial profile . for ngc  1023",
    "we find that the gc system extends out to @xmath50 kpc and for ngc  1055 out to @xmath51 kpc .",
    "ngc  7332 and ngc  7339 possess less extended gc systems , at @xmath52 kpc and @xmath53 kpc , respectively .",

    "2011 ) . in their data tables",

    "we decided to implement a more stringent magnitude cut at the faint end in order to simplify the rest of the analysis .",

    "the advantage of combining hst and wiyn data is apparent in the plot and table : the hst data allow us to probe deeper into the central regions of the host galaxy , while the wiyn data enable us to observe the full radial extent of the gc system .",
    "the innermost three points in the wiyn radial profile ( between @xmath90.75@xmath13  and 2.3@xmath13 ) overlap the radial range of the hst data , which extends from @xmath90.4@xmath13  to 2.5@xmath13 .",
    "the wiyn gc surface density values at 1.5@xmath13  and 2.3@xmath13  closely match the hst gc surface density values in that radial region , but the innermost wiyn point at 0.76@xmath13  is low ( 14.4@xmath653.0  arcmin@xmath39 ) compared to the nearby hst point ( 29.0@xmath655.6  arcmin@xmath39 ) at a projected radius of 0.83@xmath13 .",
    "we thoroughly investigated the reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "a total of 88 hst - identified gc candidates had sky positions that put them in the same region as our innermost wiyn radial profile bin .",
    "we marked these positions on our wiyn images , then individually examined them , looking for matches in the source lists .",

    "study agrees very well with our final wiyn radial profile points , though the errors on the forbes et al .",
    "data are large .",
    "a primary goal of our wide - field gc system survey is to determine an accurate value for the total number of gcs , @xmath1 , for each galaxy . to calculate this number we start by integrating the best - fitting radial profile function from the innermost bin in the profile to the outer edge of the bin in which the gc surface density vanishes within the errors .    in the case of ngc  1055 the best - fitting function ( as measured by the reduced @xmath49 value ;",
    "see table  [ table : fitting ] ) was a power law that we integrated from 0.34@xmath13  to 5.9@xmath13 .",
    "the result was 185 gcs .",
    "we can not detect gc candidates inside 0.34@xmath13  ( 1.6  kpc at the distance of ngc  1055 ) because of saturation of the ccd by light from the galaxy bulge as well as the high noise level in that region .",
    "we considered three scenarios for the behavior of the radial profile inside 0.34@xmath13 : ( 1 ) that the power law continues to very small radius ( @xmath48 very close to 0 ) ; ( 2 ) that the profile remains flat ( constant surface density ) from the innermost populated bin to @xmath48@xmath20 ; and ( 3 ) that the inner profile is similar to that of the milky way gc system .",
    "we found that integrating the power law to very small radii ( close to @xmath48@xmath20 ) yielded unrealistically large numbers of gcs in this inner region ; it added 85 gcs in a region of radius only 1.6 kpc , and increased the total number of gcs in the galaxy by 46% .",
    "thus we rejected this scenario and averaged the result of the other two methods .",
    "the second possibility was straightforward to calculate and predicted an additional 17 gcs inside 0.34@xmath13 , to yield a total of 202 . to estimate the number of gcs for the third possibility , we examined the 2010 edition of the mcmaster catalog of milky way gcs ( harris 1996 ) and identified 19 galactic gcs within 1.6  kpc of the milky way center . if one assumes that ngc  1055 has a similar surface density of gcs within its central 1.6  kpc around the galaxy center , this yields an extra 28 gcs in the central region and a final total of 213 gcs for the system .",
    "the average result for the two options ( flat or milky - way - like surface density inside 0.34@xmath13 ) yields 207.5 gcs .",
    "we computed an error on @xmath1 by adding in quadrature the errors due to fractional coverage of the gclf , poisson errors on the number of gcs and contaminating objects , and uncertainty in the number of gcs in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "our final value ( rounded to significant digits ) for the total number of gcs in ngc  1055 is @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath4 .",
    "we executed the analogous steps for ngc  1023 and integrated the best - fitting de  vaucouleurs law function from 0.27@xmath13  to 6.67@xmath13  to derive the number of gcs ( 470 ) in that region . because we had made use of the hst data from @xcite",

    "this type of trend is consistent with the biased , hierarchical scenario of gc and galaxy formation outlined in @xcite and r05 . in this type of picture , today",
    "s massive galaxies located in dense environments have comparatively high numbers of blue gcs for their stellar mass .",
    "this is because a larger proportion of their mass was in place at high redshift ( massive galaxies began the collapse and assembly process earlier than lower - mass galaxies in low - density environments ) and thus could participate in star cluster formation when the first generation of gcs was forming in the universe .",
    "detailed discussions of @xmath81 and possible scenarios that would give rise to the differences in @xmath81 values that we see are given in r05 , r07 and r10 ; suffice it to say here that the spiral and s0 galaxies in the current paper appear to have fairly typical @xmath81 for their masses and morphological types .",
    "lastly , we note that as part of the analysis of the gc color distributions , we investigated whether any color gradients are present in the galaxies gc systems .",
    "if the red , metal - rich gc population is less spatially extended compared to the blue , metal - poor gc population ( in other words , the ratio of red to blue gcs decreases with increasing radial distance from the galaxy center ) , one might expect to see a measurable color gradient in the gc system as a whole .",
    "the presence of a color gradient could imply that the gas from which the red gcs formed was subject to additional dissipational collapse compared to the gas from which the blue gcs formed ( e.g. , az92 , forbes et al .  1997 , beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) and/or that extra blue gcs are present in the galaxies halo that were accreted from metal - poor dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , ct et al .",
    "1998 ) . in any case , only ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 had enough objects in the 90% sample to do this type of analysis .",
    "we analyzed the @xmath8 color of the gc candidates as a function of projected radius and found no significant evidence for a radial color gradient in either galaxy s gc system .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_gradient ] shows the gc candidate colors versus projected radius for the 90% sample of ngc  1023 ( top ) and ngc  7332 ( bottom ) out to the radial extent of the gc system as determined in section  [ section : radial profile ] .",
    "the best fit least - squares line for each sample is plotted , with the slope determined by this fit indicated at the bottom of each plot .      as explained in section  [ section : final selection ] , during the gc candidate selection process for ngc  1023 we masked out a circular region with radius 0.6@xmath13  around the nearby dwarf satellite galaxy ngc  1023a .",
    "eight gc candidates ( point sources with magnitudes and colors like gcs ) were located within the masked area . to determine what fraction of the eight objects are likely",
    "to be truly associated with the dwarf galaxy ngc  1023a we must first consider possible sources of contamination .",
    "we estimated the surface density of contaminants ( i.e. , foreground stars and background galaxies ) in the wiyn image based on the asymptotic behavior of the profile of ngc  1023 s gc system and derived a contamination level of @xmath111 objects  arcmin@xmath39 ( section [ section : asymptotic ] ) . combining this surface density with",
    "the area of the circular masked region around the dwarf galaxy implies that 0.80@xmath650.21 contaminating objects should lie within that region .",
    "we must also consider the gc system of ngc  1023 as a source of `` contaminants '' within the area around ngc  1023a .",
    "accordingly , we used the de  vaucouleurs fit to the radial profile of the gc system of ngc  1023 ( table [ table : fitting ] ) to calculate a surface density of gcs for each pixel in the masked region of ngc  1023a . multiplying this value by the area of each pixel and summing the values of all the pixels in the masked region together yields the total contribution from the gc system of ngc  1023 in the masked region . because we are concerned about the number of _ detected _ objects , we undo the gclf completeness scaling factor that was used to construct the final radial profile of ngc  1023 ( section [ section : gclf ] ) , yielding a value of @xmath112 detectable objects from the gc system of ngc  1023 coincident with the spatial position of the dwarf galaxy ngc  1023a .",
    "considering both the contamination from foreground and background objects and from the ngc  1023 gc system , we expect a total contamination value of @xmath113 objects .",
    "one more issue needs to be addressed before we can estimate the number of gcs in ngc  1023a .",
    "this galaxy is a dwarf irregular ( dirr ) , so it has ongoing star formation .",
    "in fact , @xcite spectroscopically confirmed the presence of two young ( @xmath9125@xmath10500  myr ) blue clusters in the central region of ngc  1023a , leading them to speculate that a recent ( @xmath114 myr ) close encounter with ngc  1023 may have led to an enhanced period of star formation in the dwarf galaxy .",
    "young clusters like these may represent another source of contamination in our sample of gc candidates in ngc  1023a  young , blue open clusters might have similar magnitudes and colors to gcs . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  [ fig : color_mag_n1023a ] the integrated @xmath24 vs. @xmath115 for milky way open clusters @xcite , milky way globular clusters @xcite , and the eight gc candidates for ngc  1023a .",
    "@xmath24 for the eight gc candidates in our sample is calculated by assuming the same distance to ngc  1023a as to ngc  1023 ( table  [ table : galstats ] ) and errors are propagated from the distance modulus and photometric errors .",
    "the dashed line marks the faint - end cut in our sample at @xmath116 ( section [ section : final selection ] ) . below this line",
    "there is an area where the lowest - luminosity globular clusters and the most luminous , reddest open clusters do overlap . within our selection region",
    "however , there is a clear separation between the milky way open clusters and globular clusters .",
    "thus we do not consider open clusters to be a source of contamination in our gc candidate sample for ngc  1023a .",
    "the number of gc candidates in ngc  1023a corrected for contamination is therefore 4.1@xmath651.3 .",
    "lastly , to produce a final estimated number of gcs in ngc  1023a , we need to correct for the magnitude incompleteness ( gclf coverage ) of our data .",
    "@xcite studied the gc systems of 30 dirr galaxies and fitted the combined gclf of the systems with a gaussian function with a peak at @xmath117 and a dispersion of @xmath118 .",
    "our number of detected gc candidates is far too small to attempt to directly fit a gclf to our data .",
    "however , we note that the gclf peak in dirr galaxies is brighter than the gclf peak for giant galaxies ( @xmath44 ; @xcite ) .",
    "given that we found our coverage of the gclf in the gc system of ngc  1023 to be 57% ( section [ section : gclf ] ) , we assume at a _ minimum _ the same level of coverage of the gclf of ngc  1023a . in an alternate scenario , we assume we have detected every gc in ngc  1023a . the 57%- and 100%-complete scenarios mark the range of possible values for our coverage of the gclf .",
    "we average the result from these two possibilities and calculate that ngc  1023a has @xmath119 .",
