    "during the last several years the physics of neutrinos has achieved remarkable progress .",
    "the experiments with solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite , and also accelerator neutrinos  @xcite , have provided compelling evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations , implying non - zero neutrino masses .",
    "the present data require at least two large ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) angles in the neutrino mixing matrix and at least two mass squared differences , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 s are the neutrino masses ) , one driving the atmospheric ( @xmath5 ) and the other one the solar ( @xmath6 ) neutrino oscillations . the mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 control the solar and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations , while the third angle @xmath7 in the three neutrino mixing matrix is bound to be small by the data from the chooz and palo verde reactor experiments  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , oscillation experiments only provide bounds on the neutrino mass squared differences , i.e. they are insensitive to the overall neutrino mass scale .",
    "cosmology provides one of the means to tackle the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "the universe can be thus exploited as a new laboratory where to test neutrino masses and neutrino physics .",
    "the new accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and polarization from satellite , balloon - borne and ground - based experiments have fully confirmed the predictions of the standard cosmological model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and allow us to _ weigh _ neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos can indeed play a relevant role in large scale structure formation and leave key signatures in several cosmological data sets . more specifically , the amount of primordial relativistic neutrinos change the epoch of the matter - radiation equality , leaving an imprint on both cmb anisotropies ( through the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) and on structure formation , while non relativistic neutrinos in the recent universe suppress the growth of matter density fluctuations and galaxy clustering ( see e.g  @xcite ) .",
    "all these new observations have allowed us to place new bounds on neutrino physics from cosmology  @xcite constraining the amount of energy density in neutrinos and their mass , in the framework of three active degenerate neutrinos , to be below @xmath8  ev at @xmath9 c.l .",
    "however , the three neutrino scenario is a minimal scheme , inspired , following a theoretical prejudice , by a model which tries to resemble the three family structure of quarks and charged leptons .",
    "we now know neutrinos are different from the quark and charged lepton sectors and there is no fundamental symmetry in nature forcing a definite number of right - handed ( sterile ) neutrino species , as those are allowed in the standard model fermion content .",
    "models with three active neutrinos plus an additional sterile one ( @xmath10 models ) were introduced  @xcite to explain simultaneously solar , atmospheric and lsnd  @xcite data .",
    "the mass of a fourth , thermal , sterile neutrino has been constrained from cosmological data to be less than @xmath11  ev at @xmath9 c.l .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass are certainly remarkable , one should be careful in taking those constraints blindly , since they are obtained in a model - dependent way .",
    "for instance , the constraint on the mass of the fourth sterile neutrino presented in  @xcite is obtained under the assumption of a @xmath12 scenario with a fully thermalized sterile neutrino . on the other hand ,",
    "if different thermalization mechanisms are considered  @xcite , the cosmological constraints on neutrino masses could be relaxed or even drastically changed .",
    "more recently , scenarios with three active plus two sterile neutrinos ( @xmath13 models )  @xcite have been shown to provide a better fit to short baseline ( sbl ) data compared to @xmath12 models  @xcite , since they can , within a neutrino oscillation framework , bring into agreement the lsnd @xmath14 excess in a @xmath15 beam  @xcite and the null results from other sbl oscillation experiments .",
    "the masses for the additional mostly - sterile neutrinos we are interested in are much larger than the light neutrino ones , @xmath16 . throughout this paper , we take the convention @xmath17 .",
    "the flavor neutrino base @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is related to the massive base @xmath20 , @xmath21 , through a @xmath22 unitary matrix which we indicate as @xmath23 : @xmath24 searches of sterile neutrinos indicate that the mixing between heavy neutrinos and active neutrinos and between light neutrinos and sterile ones is very small , so throughout our study we will take @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the way in which these neutrinos shape the universe depends crucially on the thermalization processes .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to test the cosmological viability of the @xmath0 scenario in which sterile neutrinos are produced through oscillations  @xcite ( see  @xcite for earlier works ) , applying a multi - flavor treatment in the evolution of the system .",
    "we add in the analysis the most recent neutrino oscillation data , which includes the first miniboone @xmath28 oscillation results . finally , let us note that the presence of additional relativistic degrees of freedom at the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) modifies significantly the production of helium , deuterium and lithium ( a recent review is given in  @xcite , see also  @xcite ) , so this observational data on the abundance of light elements allows one to put severe constraints on sterile neutrino parameters .",
    "however , in the present study we consider the contribution of sterile neutrinos to the energy density of the universe and its effects on the cmb and on the matter power spectrum , but we do not include the data from bbn observations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we describe the sterile neutrino production .",
    "although we do not attempt to solve the exact quantum kinetic equations for a @xmath0 system , we have numerically computed the momentum - averaged counterpart with an approximation for the coherence - breaking terms .",
    "this amounts to solve an equation for the @xmath29 ( anti)neutrino density matrix in order to use these solutions in our markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses .",

    "the coefficients @xmath55 have been computed numerically and are given by @xmath56 , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the identity matrix , is the equilibrium value of the density matrix .    for the purpose of this work we can assume that , in the range of temperatures under interest , the time dependence of the temperature scales as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the hubble expansion rate . using the fact that @xmath62 we can rewrite eq .",

    ", we assume active neutrinos keep perfect thermal distribution throughout the evolution .",
    "this is justified as any active neutrino population depleted due to oscillations will be immediately repopulated thanks to its interaction with the plasma .",
    "furthermore , if there is no neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry as we are assuming , active - active oscillations must have no effect at all  @xcite .    in the following , sec .",

    "in addition to neutrino parameters discussed below , its parameters are the baryon density expressed as a fraction of the critical density multiplied by @xmath170 , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the reduced hubble constant @xmath173 , same for the cold dark matter @xmath174 , the ratio of sound horizon to the angular diameter distance @xmath175 , which is essentially a proxy for the hubble constant , the optical depth to the last scattering @xmath145 , logarithm of amplitude @xmath176 and spectral index of primordial fluctuations @xmath177 .",
    "these basic parameters are enough to provide a good fit to all available data and set other parameters . for example , the dark energy density in a flat universe is simply given by @xmath178 .    the ` cosmomc ` code has been expanded to include 5 species of neutrinos .",
    "we assume that their masses are given by @xmath179 and abundances by @xmath180    this results in four extra parameters , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , on top of those that set the basic cosmological model . in principle , indices 4 and 5 are interchangeable and therefore likelihood space is symmetric with respect to this change",
    ". we do not attempt to change the parametrization to account for that , but instead use the symmetry as an additional check for chain convergence .",
    "we use a flat prior between zero and unity for the abundance parameter @xmath183 . since at zero abundance , the mass can take any value , we limit the masses to be less than 20  ev . in practice , this upper limit is not relevant for the abundances and masses of interest .    on the data side ,",
    "we start with a conservative compendium of cosmological datasets .",
    "these include the standard cosmic microwave background data , namely wmap 5-year data  @xcite , boomerang 03 data  @xcite , the latest acbar data  @xcite and the vsa data  @xcite .",
    "in addition we use the data on the matter power spectrum from the spectroscopic survey of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) from the sdss survey  @xcite . to constrain the basic model ,",
    "we also use the constraints coming from the latest compilation of supernovae  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also apply the prior on the reduced hubble constant of @xmath184 from the hubble key project  @xcite .",
    "the basic cosmological model and the basic parameter set is what we use throughout the paper and it represents conservative constraints from the minimal cosmological model . the check the sensitivity of our constraints on the model used , we also calculate constraints on an expanded model , in which we also vary the total energy density of the universe , or equivalently the curvature , parametrized by @xmath185 , where the index @xmath186 runs over the various components of the universe and the parameter @xmath187 ( pressure over density ) that describes the equation of state of the dark energy . in the concordance model ,",
    "these two parameters have values zero and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , we also use cosmological data more aggressively and use the lyman-@xmath189 forest data from the sdss quasar sample ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this dataset provides very good constraints on the neutrino properties and has no known systematics at the moment , but it is an extremely difficult experiment that has proven to be somewhat controversial .      in practice , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we generate via a mcmc method a large number of @xmath0 models that give a potentially viable description of sbl data .",
    "specifically , in this analysis we use about @xmath190 models characterized by a sbl goodness - of - fit within about 20  @xmath191 units of the sbl best - fit .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] the behavior of the sterile neutrino abundances , normalized to the abundance at thermal equilibrium , as obtained by our analysis for the @xmath0 model that describes sbl data best ( see top row of tab .  [",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath192 and @xmath193 as the temperature of the thermal bath decreases , starting with null abundances at @xmath194  mev ( right side of plot ) . for the sbl best - fit model",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] that both sterile neutrino states reach thermal abundances before decoupling .",
    "in other words , in this case , their masses fully contribute to the sterile neutrino matter density @xmath195 .",
    "third , the viability for each of the models considered is further assessed by contrasting the predicted sterile neutrino abundances with cosmological observations , as explained next .    in order to combine the short - baseline oscillation data with the cosmological constraints , we first run extremely deep mcmc with about 70 - 100 thousands _ accepted _ samples .",
    "each sample is sampled from the combined probability density in the @xmath196-dimensional parameter space .",
    "the density of samples , projected to the 4-dimensional hyper - cube of parameters ( @xmath197 ) , thus corresponds to the probability density for those parameters , marginalized over the remaining cosmological parameters , which are , for the sake of this work , nuisance parameters .",
    "the relative probability of any model with some finite 4th and 5th neutrino masses and abundances relative to the standard minimal 3-neutrino model is calculated by comparing the relative densities of samples at the considered model position in the sample to the densities in the ( @xmath198 corner of the parameter space .",
    "we calculate the local densities of samples in spheres ( which might be cut by the edge of the parameter space , but this is taken into account ) .",
    "these are then converted to the likelihood ratios , which are in turn converted to the effective @xmath199 .",

    "the number of parameters common to both data sets is 4 in our case , since cosmological data only depend on ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 ) , where the sterile neutrino abundances @xmath208 and @xmath209 defined in sec .",
    "[ subsec : cosmo_data ] are complicated functions of all mass and mixing parameters .",
    "this is because , in general , we can not assume the sterile neutrinos to thermalize , and therefore the mixing matrix elements ( in addition to the neutrino masses ) play a role in the cosmological case also .",

    "right - handed , sterile neutrinos can be produced in the early universe via active - sterile neutrino oscillations . depending on the structure of the neutrino mixing matrix and the neutrino masses involved",
    ", sterile neutrino production can be copious . in this case ,",
    "sterile neutrinos are expected to leave a clear imprint on cosmological observables , as active neutrinos do . given the impressive accuracy reached by recent cosmological probes on one side , and the well - defined nature of the cosmological concordance model capable of interpreting those data on the other side , it is now possible to use the universe to constrain sterile neutrino properties that have traditionally been probed via laboratory - based neutrino sources .",
    "as already extensively studied in the literature , we take into account how both neutrino interactions with the primeval medium , and neutrino coherence breaking effects , affect the evolution of sterile neutrino abundances  @xcite .",
    "most previous work generally considers only the simplest sterile neutrino mixing matrix structures possible , that involves mixing a single sterile neutrino species with one or more active species  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a more general approach .",
    "we generalize those results to account for all mixing effects arising when multiple sterile neutrino flavors participate in the oscillations .",
    "indeed , once sterile neutrinos are added to the standard model fermion content , there is no fundamental reason to expect only sterile single - flavor mixing effects .",
    "in addition to full numerical results that are valid , to a good approximation , for generic sterile neutrino models ( with the only requirement of relativistic decoupling of sterile neutrinos ) , we try to emphasize the underlying physics by developing an analytical description that is applicable for sterile neutrinos that are significantly more massive than the active ones , for a mixing matrix that is approximately block - diagonal in its active and sterile sectors , and for sub - thermal sterile neutrino abundances at decoupling . in the latter case ,",
    "we obtain the following three main results , valid for any number of sterile neutrino species : first , that the production of sterile neutrinos arises entirely from the breaking of the coherence of the evolution of active neutrinos ; second , that each active flavor contributes independently to the sterile neutrino abundances ; and third , that the evolution of the abundances of distinct sterile neutrino species is independent from one another , in absence of mixing in the sterile sector .    within our full multi - flavor framework ,",
    "we have also studied in detail the phenomenology of the so - called @xmath0 sterile neutrino models  @xcite .",
    "two additional heavy ( mostly - sterile ) neutrino states with masses in the ev range , beyond the minimal three active neutrino mixing scenario , and with small amounts of electron and muon flavor content , are considered in this case .",
    "these @xmath0 models were originally introduced as a means to reconcile via standard @xmath223 oscillations the currently unexplained @xmath14 excess observed by the lsnd experiment with the solar and atmospheric oscillation signatures .",
    "we first study the sterile neutrino evolution in the early universe of @xmath0 models that offer a potentially viable explanation of all short - baseline oscillation data , including the lsnd excess and first @xmath166 results recently released by the miniboone collaboration .",
    "we then contrast the expected energy density of the universe in the form of sterile neutrinos obtained by those models with the latest cosmological observations coming from cosmic microwave background datasets and galaxy surveys , mostly ( but not only ) in the framework of the minimal @xmath169cdm cosmological model .",
    "in contrast with some literature , we find that fully solving the neutrino kinetic equations is necessary even for the relatively large active - sterile mixing implied by this class of models , since sterile neutrino states do not always feature thermal abundances at decoupling . this result , valid for the minimal @xmath169cdm cosmological model , should be taken into account in future studies on sterile neutrino production in the early universe , in order to avoid possibly misleading conclusions .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 model that best describes short - baseline oscillation data is excluded at high confidence level by cosmological observations , which do not allow for large amounts of energy density in the form of relativistic species in addition to the energy density of active neutrinos , unless non - minimal @xmath169cdm models are used .",
    "nevertheless , by fully exploring the neutrino parameter space , we do find @xmath0 sterile neutrino models that provide a perfectly acceptable description of short - baseline and cosmological data simultaneously , with a 11% probability for compatibility between the two datasets . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 models are significantly more disfavored by the internal inconsistencies between sterile neutrino interpretations of appearance and disappearance short - baseline data themselves  @xcite , rather than by the used cosmological data .",
    "finally , a global analysis of all short - baseline plus cosmological data allow us to further constrain the @xmath0 neutrino parameter space , in a region that should be accessible by future experiments aiming to study neutrinos , both the ones permeating the cosmos and neutrinos produced on earth .",

    "<S> light sterile neutrinos might mix with the active ones and be copiously produced in the early universe . in the present paper , a detailed multi - flavor analysis of sterile neutrino production is performed . </S>",
    "<S> making some justified approximations allows us to consider not only neutrino interactions with the primeval medium and neutrino coherence breaking effects , but also oscillation effects arising from the presence of three light ( mostly - active ) neutrino states mixed with two heavier ( mostly - sterile ) states . </S>",
    "<S> first , we emphasize the underlying physics via an analytical description of sterile neutrino abundances that is valid for cases with small mixing between active and sterile neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study in detail the phenomenology of @xmath0 sterile neutrino models in light of short - baseline oscillation data , including the lsnd and miniboone results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by using the information provided by this analysis , we obtain the expected sterile neutrino cosmological abundances and then contrast them with the most recent available data from cosmic microwave background and large scale structure observations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that @xmath0 models are significantly more disfavored by the internal inconsistencies between sterile neutrino interpretations of appearance and disappearance short - baseline data themselves , rather than by the used cosmological data .    </S>",
