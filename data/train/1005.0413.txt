    "previous work @xcite investigated the orbital stability of earth - mass planets in the hz of systems with a jupiter - mass companion . in their pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite estimated the stability of four known planetary systems in the hz of their host stars . @xcite",
    "considered the dynamical stability of 100 terrestrial mass - planets ( modelled as test particles ) in the hzs of the then - known 85 extra - solar planetary systems . from their simulations",
    ", they generated a tabular list of stable hzs for all observed systems .",
    "however , that study did not systematically consider eccentricity , is not generalizable to arbitrary planet masses , and relies on numerical experiments to determine stability .",
    "a similar study by @xcite also examined the stability of earth - mass planets in the hz .",
    "their results indicated that @xmath5 of the systems in their sample had `` sustained habitability '' .",
    "their simulations were also not generalizable and based on a large set of numerical experiments which assumed the potentially habitable planet was on a circular orbit .",
    "most recently , @xcite considered systems consisting of a giant planet with a maximum eccentricity of @xmath6 and a terrestrial planet ( modelled as a test particle initially in circular orbit ) they used relative lyapunov indicators and fast lyapunov indicators to identify stable zones and generated a stability catalog , which can be applied to systems with mass - ratios in the range @xmath7 between the giant planet and the star .",
    "although this catalog is generalizable to massive planets between a saturn - mass and @xmath8 , it still assumes the terrestrial planet is on a circular orbit .",
    "these studies made great strides toward a universal definition of hz stability .",
    "however , several aspects of each study could be improved , such as a systematic assessment of the stability of terrestrial planets on eccentric orbits , a method that eliminates the need for computationally expensive numerical experiments , and wide coverage of planetary masses . in this investigation",
    "we address each of these points and develop a simple analytic approach that applies to arbitrary configurations of a giant - plus - terrestrial planetary system .    as of march 2010 , 376 extra - solar planetary systems have been detected , and the majority ( 331 , @xmath9 ) are single planet systems .",
    "this opens up the possibility that there may be additional planets not yet detected , in the stable regions of these systems .",
    "according to @xcite more than @xmath10 of known single planet systems show evidence for additional companions .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the distribution of observed planets rises steeply towards smaller masses .",
    "the analyses of @xcite & @xcite suggests that many systems may have low mass planets ms@xmath11 , which can only detect low - mass planets in tight orbits . ] .",
    "therefore , maps of stable regions in known planetary systems can aid observers in their quest to discover more planets in known systems .",
    "we consider two definitions of dynamical stability : ( 1 ) _ hill stability _ : a system is hill - stable if the ordering of planets is conserved , even if the outer - most planet escapes to infinity .",
    "( 2 ) _ lagrange stability _ :",
    "in this kind of stability , every planet s motion is bounded , i.e , no planet escapes from the system and exchanges are forbidden . hill stability for a two - planet , non",
    "- resonant system can be described by an analytical expression @xcite , whereas no analytical criteria are available for lagrange stability so we investigate it through numerical simulations .",
    "previous studies by @xcite showed that hill stability is a reasonable approximation to lagrange stability in the case of two approximately jupiter - mass planets .",
    "part of the goal of our present work is to broaden the parameter space considered by @xcite .    in this investigation",
    ", we explore the stability of hypothetical @xmath12 and @xmath13 planets in the hz and in the presence of giant and super - earth planets .",
    "we consider nonzero initial eccentricities of terrestrial planets and find that a modified version of the hill stability criterion adequately describes the lagrange stability boundary .",
    "furthermore , we provide an analytical expression that identifies the lagrange stability boundary of two - planet , non - resonant systems .    utilizing these boundaries ,",
    "we provide a catalog of fractions of hzs that are lagrange stable for terrestrial mass planets in all the currently known single planet systems .",
    "this catalog can help guide observers toward systems that can host terrestrial - size planets in their hz .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we discuss the hill and lagrange stability criteria , describe our numerical methods , and present our model of the hz . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present our results and explain how to identify the lagrange stability boundary for any system with one @xmath14 planet and one @xmath15 planet . in section [ sec4 ] , we apply our results to some of the known single planet systems",
    ". finally , in section [ sec5 ] , we summarize the investigation , discuss its importance for observational programs , and suggest directions for future research .",
    "according to @xcite , a system is hill stable if the following inequality is satisfied :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the total mass of the system , @xmath18 is the gravitational constant , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total angular momentum of the system , @xmath21 is the total energy , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the masses of the planets and the star , respectively .",
    "we call the left hand side of eq.([bbc ] ) @xmath25 and the right hand - side @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 , then a system is definitely hill stable , if not the hill stability is unknown .",
    "studies by @xcite found that for two jupiter mass planets , if @xmath28 ( and no resonances are present ) , then the system is lagrange stable .",
    "moreover , barnes et al .",
    "( 2008a ) found that systems tend to be packed if @xmath29 and not packed when @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the vast majority of two - planet systems are observed with @xmath31 and hence are packed .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the hd 47186 planetary system , with @xmath32 the largest value among known , non - controversial systems that have not been affected by tides values for the known extra - solar multiple planet systems .",
    "] , may have at least one additional ( terrestrial mass ) companion in the hz between the two known planets .    to determine the dynamically stable regions around single planet systems , we numerically explore the mass , semi - major axis and eccentricity space of model systems , which cover the range of observed of extra - solar planets .",
    "in all the models ( listed in table [ table1 ] ) , we assume that the hypothetical additional planet is either @xmath12 or @xmath1 and consider the following massive companions , ( which we presume are already known to exist ) : ( 1 ) @xmath8 , ( 2 ) @xmath33 ( 3 ) @xmath34 , ( 4 ) @xmath35 ( 5 ) @xmath36 , ( 6 ) @xmath37 ( 7 ) @xmath38 , ( 8) @xmath39 ( 9 ) @xmath40 ( 10 ) @xmath41 and ( 11 ) @xmath1 .",
    "most simulations assume that the host star has the same mass , effective temperature ( @xmath42 ) and luminosity as the sun .",
    "orbital elements such as the longitude of periastron @xmath43 are chosen randomly before the beginning of the simulation ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) only depends weakly on them ) . for `` known '' saturns and super - earths , we fix semi - major axis @xmath44 at @xmath6 au ( and the hz is exterior ) or at @xmath45 au ( the hz interior ) . for super - jupiter and jupiter mass , @xmath44",
    "is fixed either at @xmath46 au or at @xmath47 au .",
    "these choices allow at least part of the hz to be lagrange stable .",
    "although we choose configurations that focus on the hz , the results should apply to all regions in the system .",
    "we explore dynamical stability by performing a large number of n - body simulations , each with a different initial condition .",
    "for the known planet , we keep @xmath44 constant and vary its initial eccentricity , @xmath48 , from @xmath49 in steps of @xmath50 .",
    "we calculate @xmath51 from eq.([bbc ] ) , by varying the hypothetical planet s semi - major axis and initial eccentricity . in order to find the lagrange stability boundary , we perform numerical simulations along a particular @xmath51 curve , with mercury @xcite , using the hybrid integrator .",
    "we integrate each configuration for @xmath52 years , long enough to identify unstable regions @xcite .",
    "the time step was small enough that energy is conserved to better than 1 part in @xmath53 .",
    "a system is considered lagrange unstable if the semi - major axis of the terrestrial mass planet changes by 15% of the initial value or if the two planets come within @xmath54 hill radii of each other . in total",
    "we ran @xmath55 simulations which required @xmath56 hours of cpu time .",
    "we use the definition of the `` eccentric habitable zone '' ( ehz ; @xcite ) , which is the hz from selsis et al ( 2007 ) , with @xmath57 cloud cover , but assumes the orbit - averaged flux determines surface temperature ( williams & pollard 2002 ) .",
    "in other words , the ehz is the range of orbits for which a planet receives as much flux over an orbit as a planet on a circular orbit in the hz of @xcite .",
    "in figs . 1 & 2 , we show representative results of our numerical simulations from the jupiter mass planet with hypothetical earth mass planet case discussed in section [ sec2 ] . in all panels of figs . 1 & 2 , the blue squares and red triangles represent lagrange stable and unstable simulations respectively",
    ", the black circle represents the `` known '' planet and the shaded green region represents the ehz . for each case",
    ", we also plot @xmath51 contours calculated from eq .",
    "( [ bbc ] ) . in any given panel , as @xmath44 increases , the curves change from all unstable ( all red triangles ) to all stable ( all blue squares ) , with a transition region in between .",
    "we designate a particular @xmath51 contour as @xmath58 , beyond which ( larger values ) a hypothetical terrestrial mass planet is stable for all values of @xmath44 and @xmath48 , for at least @xmath52 years .",
    "we tested @xmath58 is the first @xmath51 ( close to the known massive planet ) that is completely stable ( only blue squares ) . for @xmath51 curves below @xmath58 , all or",
    "some locations along those curves may be unstable ; hence , @xmath58 is a conservative representation of the lagrange stability boundary .",
    "similarly , we designate @xmath59 as the largest value of @xmath51 for which all configurations are unstable . therefore , the range @xmath60 is a transition region , where the hypothetical planet s orbit changes from unstable ( @xmath59 ) to stable ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "typically this transition occurs over @xmath61 .",
    "although figs . 1 & 2 only show curves in this transition region , we performed many more integrations at larger and smaller values of @xmath51 , but exclude them from the plot to improve the readability .",
    "for all cases , _ all our simulations with @xmath62 are stable , and all with @xmath63 are unstable . _    these figures show that the lagrange stability boundary significantly diverges from hill stability boundary , as the eccentricity of the known jupiter - mass planet increases .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 is more or less independent ( within @xmath64 ) of whether the jupiter mass planet lies at @xmath46 au or at @xmath47 au .",
    "if an extra - solar planetary system is known to have a jupiter mass planet , then one can calculate @xmath51 over a range of @xmath44 & @xmath48 , and those regions with @xmath62 are stable .",
    "we show explicit examples of this methodology in section 4 .",
    "we also consider host star masses of @xmath65 and performed additional simulations .",
    "we do not show our results here , but they indicate the mass of the star does not effect stability boundaries .",
    "in this section we consider the broader range of `` known '' planetary masses discussed in section 2 and listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "figures [ jefig_in ] & [ jefig_out ] show that as the eccentricity of the `` known '' planet increases , @xmath58 and @xmath59 appear to change monotonically .",
    "this trend is apparent on all our simulations , and suggests @xmath58 and @xmath59 may be described by an analytic function of the mass and eccentricity of the known planet .",
    "therefore , instead of plotting the results from these models in @xmath66 space , as shown in figs . [ jefig_in ] & [ jefig_out ] , we identified these analytical expressions that relate @xmath58 and @xmath59 to mass @xmath22 and eccentricity @xmath67 of the known massive planet .",
    "although these fits were made for planets near the host star , these fits should apply in all cases , irrespective of it s distance from the star . in the following equations , the parameter @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath22 is expressed in earth masses and @xmath69 .",
    "the stability boundaries for systems with hypothetical @xmath12 and @xmath1 mass companion are : @xmath70 where @xmath71 indicate stable or unstable and the coefficients for each case are given table 2 .",

    "the fraction of the hz that is stable for @xmath12 is @xmath100 and for @xmath1 is @xmath101 .",

    "although the current work focuses on terrestrial mass planets , the same analysis can be applied to arbitrary configurations that cover all possible orbital parameters .",

    "<S> we study the dynamical stability of planetary systems consisting of one hypothetical terrestrial mass planet ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and one massive planet ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider masses and orbits that cover the range of observed planetary system architectures ( including non - zero initial eccentricities ) , determine the stability limit through n - body simulations , and compare it to the analytic hill stability boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for given masses and orbits of a two planet system , a single parameter , which can be calculated analytically , describes the lagrange stability boundary ( no ejections or exchanges ) but which diverges significantly from the hill stability boundary . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do find that the actual boundary is fractal , and therefore we also identify a second parameter which demarcates the transition from stable to unstable evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show the portions of the habitable zones of @xmath3 crb , hd 164922 , gj 674 , and hd 7924 which can support a terrestrial planet . </S>",
    "<S> these analyses clarify the stability boundaries in exoplanetary systems and demonstrate that , for most exoplanetary systems , numerical simulations of the stability of potentially habitable planets are only necessary over a narrow region of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> finally we also identify and provide a catalog of known systems which can host terrestrial planets in their habitable zones . </S>"
