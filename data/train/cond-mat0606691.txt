    "in the past two decades , quantum magnetism has been serving not only as effective theories describing insulating phases of strongly - correlated electron systems but also as theoretical laboratories to look for and test new concepts .",
    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductors sparked the search for unconventional or exotic phases which are quite different from the ordinary ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic phases . despite the effort of many researchers in searching for novelty , it is by",
    "now well - known that , in two- or higher dimensions , antiferromagnetic phases are found provided that spin frustration is not very strong @xcite . in order to suppress antiferromagnetism and stabilize exotic phases@xcite ,",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "one realistic example of such mechanisms would be multispin - exchange interactions .",
    "such interactions are expected to be crucial for explaining unusual magnetic behavior in @xmath3 absorbed on graphite@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was reported that a certain amount of four - spin ring exchange would be necessary to account for neutron - scattering experiments for the parent compound of high - temperature superconductor@xcite @xmath4 and for a spin - ladder compound@xcite @xmath5 .",
    "extensive numerical simulations carried out@xcite for the two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with four - spin ring exchange found various phases with unconventional orders : a spin - nematic phase @xcite and a spin - liquid phase with topological ordering @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "various approaches have been proposed in electron systems to unify several ( and sometimes quite different ) competing orders@xcite and succeeded in clarifying the nature of the quantum phase transitions among them @xcite .",
    "usually , in those approaches , extended symmetries are adopted so that mutually competing order parameters may be transformed to each other .",
    "a typical example would be the so(5 ) theory@xcite for the competition between @xmath6-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , where the order parameters of @xmath6-wave superconductivity and those of antiferromagnetism are combined to form a unified order parameter quintet . for a one - dimensional geometry ( two - leg ladders ) , it is known that even larger symmetries so(8 ) @xcite and so(6 ) @xcite can emerge at low energies and be useful for the description of the electronic phases at half - filling and away from half - filling , respectively .",
    "in particular , the existence of an extended symmetry might provide a route to classify one - dimensional gapped phases @xcite .    unfortunately , no systematic approach based on extended symmetries is known for unconventional phases found in spin ladders and it is desirable to construct such theories . as the first step along this line",
    ", we investigate here two - leg spin ladders with four - spin interactions , since they possess high enough symmetry to unify various competing orders . without the four - spin interactions ,",
    "the two - leg spin ladder has a finite spin gap in magnetic excitations and short - ranged magnetic correlations@xcite .",
    "basic physics of the two - leg ladder can be understood by considering a ground state consisting of almost localized dimer singlets on antiferromagnetic rung bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2leg_ladder ] ) and low - energy excitations over it . for this reason",
    ", the spin - gap phase in the usual two - leg spin ladder sometimes is dubbed as rung - singlet- or rung - dimer phase .",
    "if we change the rung coupling to ferromagnetic , the rung bonds will be dominantly occupied not by singlets but by triplets .",
    "then , the system is effectively equivalent to the spin-1 systems and the knowledges in those systems may apply @xcite .",
    "when the four - spin interactions ( say , ring - exchange ) are switched on , the size of the spin gap will be reduced and finally at a certain critical strength it even vanishes@xcite .",
    "large - scale numerical simulations@xcite suggested that the model has a rather rich phase diagram .",
    "in particular , a spin liquid phase with scalar chirality ordering was found @xcite .",
    "such a phase breaks both time - reversal and parity symmetries and has been discussed previously in the context of anyon superconductivity @xcite .",
    "a hallmark of the unconventional phases in the phase diagram of the two - leg spin ladder with ring - exchange interaction is that neither singlets nor triplets dominate over the others .",
    "hence , the conventional approaches starting from the limit of strong rung couplings ( whether ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) is not very convenient to explore the nature of novel phases stabilized by four - spin interactions .",

    "[ fig:2leg_ladder ] ]    the organization of the present paper reads as follows . in section [ sec : model_and_sym ] , we construct the ladder hamiltonian by requiring rotational invariance and equivalence of two constituent chains .",
    "our goal is to unify several unconventional phases stabilized by four - spin interactions . to this end",
    ", we shall use an enlarged symmetry su(4 ) which contains the ordinary ( spin ) su(2 ) .",
    "we shall also pay particular attention to an interesting symmetry ( _ spin - chirality transformation _ ) which is a special case of the above su(4 ) and commutes with the spin rotation .",
    "this symmetry , which has been introduced@xcite in the context of the ring - exchange two - leg spin ladder , exchanges the nel order parameter with the vector chirality ( the order parameter of a @xmath0-type nematic @xcite )",
    ". it will play a crucial role in our analysis and give an important clue to understand the global structure of the phase diagram .",
    "a low - energy field - theory analysis will be developed in section [ sec : cont_limit ] .",
    "although various field - theory approaches are known for two - leg ladder systems@xcite , most of them start from the limit of two decoupled chains and will not be suited to investigating the phase structure when four - spin interactions are by no means small . instead of starting from two weakly - coupled @xmath8 chains",
    ", we shall take the su(4)-invariant point , which is a special case of the lattice hamiltonian , as the starting point .",
    "the rotational- and the spin - chirality symmetry are beautifully incorporated into our low - energy effective action .    in section [ sec : rg - analysis ] , the phase structure and unexpected high symmetry among unconventional phases will be discussed with the help of one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) calculation . in particular , we shall find four dominant phases where su(4 ) ( so(6 ) , more precisely ) symmetry is approximately restored in the low - energy limit .",
    "the quantum phase transitions among these dominant phases will be investigated in sections [ sec : physics_selfdual ] and [ sec : other_qcp ] . the crucial role played by the spin - chirality symmetry in transitions among spin - singlet phases",
    "will be revealed . in this respect , a bosonization scheme based on u(1)@xmath9su(3 ) symmetry",
    "will be introduced to extract relevant low - energy degrees of freedom which govern the phase transition . by using an effective theory for the low - energy fluctuations of a vector doublet composed of competing order parameters",
    ", we shall clarify how time - reversal symmetry is broken in one of these unconventional phases .",
    "readers who are not interested in the detail of the field - theoretical analysis may skip sections [ sec : cont_limit ] , [ sec : rg - analysis ] , and [ sec : other_qcp ] .",
    "our main results have been already published in part as a short communication @xcite .    in order to supplement the field - theoretical analysis",
    ", we shall carry out a variational- and a strong - coupling analysis in section [ sec : global - str ] .",
    "as has been described above , the usual strong - coupling expansion starting from the limit of isolated rungs is not very convenient .",
    "instead , we shall start from the limit of isolated _ plaquettes _ to successfully describe the competition among several quantum phases . on the basis of results obtained from these analyses , we map out the global phase diagram and discuss a connection to a spin-1 bosonic @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "this relationship might be useful for the possible experimental realization of the exotic gapped phases stabilized by four - spin exchange interactions .",
    "indeed , in standard two - leg ladder compounds discovered so far , four - spin exchange interactions ( 1020% of leg / rung interactions ) are not strong enough to stabilize the spin liquid phase with scalar chirality ordering in these systems .",
    "however , with the connection to spin-1 bosonic @xmath1-@xmath2 model presented in section [ sec : global - str ] , one can expect that this phase ( together with other unconventional ones ) might be feasible in ultra - cold bosonic atomic gases in optical lattices@xcite .",
    "finally , section viii presents our concluding remarks and technical details will be presented in the appendixes .",
    "as it has been discussed in the introduction , enlarged symmetries are very powerful in unifying various competing orders .",
    "therefore , it is necessary first to identify the enlarged symmetry in our problem .",
    "since we are considering spin-1/2 two - leg ladders , the maximal symmetry would be su(4 ) .",
    "the appearance of su(4 ) in our problem is easily understood by noting that four states ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) on a single rung ( say , @xmath7-th rung in fig . [ fig:2leg_ladder](a ) ) span the four - dimensional defining representation ( * 4 * ) of su(4 ) @xcite .",
    "let us denote @xmath8 spins on the first- ( upper ) and the second ( lower ) chains by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "then , one of the standard choices of the 15 generators @xmath16 on the @xmath7-th rung is @xmath17 the explicit matrix expressions of these generators are given in appendix [ sec : su4_generators ] .",
    "now we are at the point of constructing the hamiltonian by requiring the invariance under ( i ) su(2 ) , ( ii ) @xmath18 ( @xmath19 : interchange of the two chains .",
    "[ fig:2leg_ladder ] ) and ( iii ) reflection with respect to horizontal links ( _ link parity _ ) .",
    "since we are considering @xmath8 , we can safely restrict ourselves to second - order polynomials in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we can divide them into ( a ) a scalar , ( b ) ( so(3)-)vectors and ( c ) rank-2 symmetric tensors .",
    "of course , the scalar is given by @xmath22 and the followings are all vectors : @xmath23 although the last one seems an antisymmetric tensor , it behaves like a ( pseudo)vector in the spin space and serves as the order parameter of the @xmath0-type spin nematic@xcite .",
    "on top of them , we have a symmetric tensor whose components are given essentially by @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 which reduces to a set of order parameters of the @xmath26-type spin nematic@xcite when the dimer bonds are occupied by triplets .",
    "the point here is that all these operators are essentially the su(4 ) generators ( see appendix [ sec : su4_generators].2 for more details ) .",
    "now we proceed to constructing a hamiltonian .",
    "if we consider only interactions involving two neighboring rungs ( i.e. four spins ) , the su(2)- and @xmath18-invariance strongly restrict the possible interactions and we are left with the following seven ones :    @xmath27 \\end{split } \\label{eqn : int_3 } \\\\ \\begin{split } { \\cal h}_{4}&= \\sum_{r } 4({\\text{\\bf s}}_{1,r}\\times{\\text{\\bf s}}_{2,r}){\\cdot}({\\text{\\bf s}}_{1,r+1}\\times{\\text{\\bf s}}_{2,r+1 } ) \\\\ & = 4 \\sum_{r } \\bigl [   ( { \\text{\\bf s}}_{1,r}{\\cdot}{\\text{\\bf",

    "in fact , the above ope yields the contribution like @xmath557 which will pin the charge @xmath558-field for large enough @xmath518 .",
    "therefore , we may fix the value of the @xmath558-field and drop @xmath542 in the following analysis .",
    "the final step is to rewrite the su(4 ) hamiltonian @xmath77 in terms of six majorana fermions .",
    "the mapping is provided by the following correspondence : @xmath559 where the integer @xmath0 is defined by @xmath560(l ) and @xmath561(r ) .",
    "the majorana fermions @xmath562 @xmath153 have been introduced to guarantee the anticommutation .",
    "the following formulas proved by taking opes are useful in rewriting the su(4 ) hamiltonian ( [ eqn : su4_step1 ] ) : @xmath563 the majorana fermions are normalized so that @xmath564 and the majorana bilinears @xmath565 are defined as @xmath566 by using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : boson_to_majorana1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : boson_to_majorana2 ] ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : su4_step1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath567 where we have introduced the renormalized velocity @xmath568 . similarly , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : boson_to_majorana2 ] ) enables us to recast the second term of @xmath77 as : @xmath569 from these equations , we finally obtain the desired result : @xmath570 for repulsive interaction @xmath571 , the interaction ( the last term ) is marginally irrelevant and known to yield logarithmic corrections@xcite to physical quantities .",
    "if the duality transformation ( [ eqn : duality2 ] ) works not only on a lattice but also in a low - energy field theory , the uniform part of the generators derived above should obey the _ same _ transformation rule ( since the duality transformation does not change momentum of the system ) . plugging eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sc_majorana2]),([eqn : su4bymajorana1 ] ) into ( [ eqn : o2_doublet ] ) , we obtain the following set of equations for the uniform part of @xmath51 : @xmath572 where we have dropped the indices l / r and @xmath573 .",
    "since all three equations are satisfied simultaneously for a transformation which is independent both of color ( @xmath247 ) and of the chirality ( l / r ) , we try the following : @xmath574 after some algebra , we see that the above equations are satisfied if we choose the parameter @xmath575 as @xmath576 moreover , it is not difficult to verify that the above choice works for the equations for @xmath52 as well : @xmath577 therefore , we may conclude that the following color- and chirality ( l / r ) independent so(2 ) transformation @xmath578 generates the ` duality ' in the continuum limit : @xmath579    this is not the end of the story .",
    "besides the uniform part discussed above , the continuum expression of the su(4 ) generators contain two kinds of oscillating parts ; one has momentum @xmath580 and oscillates in a staggered manner , and the others exhibits @xmath581 oscillation .",
    "the argument goes similarly for the @xmath553-part and we can verify that the choice ( [ eqn : duality_cont ] ) works .",
    "the easiest way to write down the transformation of the @xmath582-part would be to use the dirac fermions instead of majorana fermions @xmath583 and @xmath584 and look for the correct transformation rule for the dirac quartet .",
    "again , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : duality_eq ] ) , we require that the @xmath582-part of the _ transformed _",
    "su(4 ) generators @xmath585 be correctly reproduced by linear combinations of the original generators as in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : transf1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : transf2 ] ) .",
    "the answer is quite simple and is given as follows : @xmath586 where @xmath587 and @xmath588 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : duality2 ] ) .",
    "the operator - product expansion of interaction operators is defined as : @xmath589 since @xmath438 are written in terms of free fermions @xmath590 and @xmath591 , it is straightforward to compute the right - hand side .",
    "the only non - zero ope coefficients are listed below : @xmath592",
    "in this appendix , we describe how to obtain ground - state degeneracy by inspecting the classical ground states within the bosonization approach .",
    "as has been mentioned before , bosonic expressions of the physical operators have a kind of ` gauge redundancy ' and the ground states should be counted modulo the gauge redundancy .    to this end , we have first to identify physical operators for which we define ` gauge transformations ' .",
    "one obvious choice may be u(3 ) dirac fermions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : diracfer ] ) .",
    "however , the expansion of physical ( lattice ) operators in terms of the continuum ones contains the @xmath582-terms which can not be expressed by these dirac fermions .",
    "this obscures how to impose the gauge - equivalence for three bosons @xmath259 , @xmath318 , and @xmath320 .",

    "for this reason , we recover the charge boson @xmath558(@xmath604 ) and add the following umklapp term to find the semiclassical vacua of our problem : @xmath605    the procedure is as follows .",

    "<S> a unifying approach to competing quantum orders in generalized two - leg spin ladders is presented . </S>",
    "<S> hidden relationship and quantum phase transitions among the competing orders are thoroughly discussed by means of a low - energy field theory starting from an su(4 ) quantum multicritical point . </S>",
    "<S> our approach reveals that the system has a relatively simple phase structure in spite of its complicated interactions . on top of the u(1)-symmetry which is known from previous studies to mixes up antiferromagnetic order parameter with that of the @xmath0-type nematic </S>",
    "<S> , we find an emergent u(1)-symmetry which mixes order parameters dual to the above . on the basis of the field - theoretical- and variational analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we give a qualitative picture for the global structure of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> interesting connection to other models ( e.g. bosonic @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) is also discussed . </S>"
