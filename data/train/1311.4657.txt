    "the spin - flip model @xcite , abbreviated as sfm model , has been very successful in explaining different polarization properties of quantum well - based vertical cavity surface emitting lasers ( vcsels ) , such as selection of polarization state , polarization dynamics , switching of polarization state .",
    "this model considers two different electronic transitions associated to different magnetic sublevels of the conduction and heavy - hole valence bands and thus giving rise to gain for the two circularly polarized components of laser light of opposite helicities .",
    "later , the sfm model has been extended to incorporate the effect of material birefringence ( linear phase anisotropy ) , gain dichroism ( gain anisotropy ) , saturable dispersion ( linewidth enhancement factor or henry factor ) , etc . , which dictate different stability criteria of the linearly polarized modes of a vcsel @xcite .",
    "moreover , many other properties such as the effect of nonlinear phase anisotropy @xcite , influence of polarization dynamics on the noise properties @xcite , existence of elliptical or higher order transverse modes and possibilities of having chaotic behavior even in free running lasers @xcite , have been quite successfully explained based on the fundamental ideas of spin dependent carrier dynamics as described in the sfm model .",
    "recently , the possibility for vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers ( vecsels ) to sustain simultaneous oscillation of two orthogonal linearly polarized modes of slightly different frequencies has been evidenced @xcite .",
    "these dual - frequency lasers are very useful for microwave photonics applications @xcite such as to generate high purity optically - carried tunable radio - frequency ( rf ) signals , which are essential for metrology , remote sensing , and analog communication applications @xcite .",
    "such dual - frequency oscillation has also been achieved in different kinds of solid - state lasers @xcite .",
    "but the inherent class - b dynamical behavior of such solid - state lasers , as the population inversion lifetime is much longer than the intra - cavity photon lifetimes , gives rise to strong intensity noises resonant at the relaxation oscillation frequencies @xcite .",
    "this low - frequency intensity noise limits the spectral purity of the beatnote generated by dual - frequency solid - state lasers . on the contrary",
    ", the dual - frequency vecsel overcomes this limitation since the cm - long external cavity ensures class - a dynamical behavior of the laser by making intra - cavity photon lifetime much longer than the carrier lifetime inside the semiconductor active medium @xcite .",
    "moreover , to obtain stable simultaneous oscillation of the two modes , the nonlinear coupling constant between the modes is reduced below unity by spatially separating the two modes inside the gain medium with an intra - cavity birefringent crystal .",
    "the dependence of this nonlinear coupling constant on the spatial separation between the modes has already been experimentally investigated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectral behavior of the correlation between the intensity noises of the two modes has also been investigated experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "these correlations play an important role to determine the purity of the rf beatnote since the intensity noise is coupled to the phase noise due to the large henry factor of the quantum well gain medium @xcite . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we developed a fully heuristic rate equation model for the laser , which completely overlooked the spin - dependent dynamics of the carriers as mentioned in the sfm model .",
    "this model was a standard two - mode rate equation model in which nonlinear cross - saturation coupling terms were added to mimic the nonlinear coupling between modes @xcite .",
    "although this model was surprisingly successful to explain the behavior of nonlinear coupling and noise properties of the two linear polarized modes in the dual - frequency vecsel , it seems important to be able to justify it on more solid grounds , taking into account in particular the spin - dependent dynamics in the quantum wells .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is thus to analyze the properties of the two orthogonally polarized modes of a dual - frequency vecsel from the perspective of the sfm model .",
    "we start by writing the rate equations for our laser based on the ideas of the sfm model and taking into account the partial spatial overlap between the modes",

    "the second difference comes from the intra - cavity bc , which spatially separates the two modes inside the gain structure .",
