    "as a candidate of a theory - of - everything , string theory has led to many striking results . among them",
    "we find the string theory landscape @xcite , a very complicated structure of vacuum states of the theory which raises its own questions and problems .",
    "all models of this landscape are rich and complex , and the existence of this landscape is almost beyond doubt @xcite . when deriving cosmological models in a landscape we are led to the notion of multiverse @xcite , a quantum ensemble of different classical cosmological models .",
    "the multiverse shows very appealing features , such as inflation , which is needed to remedy the difficulties of older cosmological models @xcite , and it is generally believed that the cosmological constant @xcite and the coincidence problems can be solved with realistic models of the multiverse @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the multiverse has its own problems , which will be described briefly .",
    "the huge amount of possible universes present in the landscape @xcite should be complemented with a probability distribution which can explain why we are living in this particular universe .",
    "the standard rule of assigning probabilities as proportional to @xmath2 for some euclidean action @xmath3 breaks down in this context because the classical action of a cosmological model is divergent due to the infinite spacetime volume . to extract some useful information",
    ", the action should be regularized , but there are many different ways of regulating an infinite volume because no cut - off procedure is invariant under a coordinate change .",
    "different regularization procedures can lead to different probability distributions predicting different universes .",
    "this is known as the measure problem @xcite , which consists in giving an unambiguous definition of the relative probabilities in a given landscape model .",
    "so far , the measures derived from first principles need the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and similar ideas as a key ingredient @xcite , which has an stringy origin , and thus the whole picture is slowly evolving towards a unified formalism of the multiverse derived from string theory .    when a multiverse model is used to explain , for example , the smallness of the observed cosmological constant ( @xmath4 in planck units ) @xcite , theory should bring a probability distribution of @xmath5 values .",
    "this probability distribution should take into account the number of states of the landscape , but also its relative probability computed using a measure as stated above .",
    "this measure is derived from a mechanism by which states are populated in the landscape , for example , by some form of euclidean quantum gravity , with its own difficulties as commented in the previous paragraph , or by eternal inflation , which populates all states in the landscape in a stochastic fashion .",
    "when considering the distribution of @xmath5 values conditioned on those states which support some form of observers ( like us ) @xcite , one needs to add an anthropic factor to the probability which should be provided to complete the prediction .",
    "therefore , there are three parts which contribute to the final probability : the distribution of the states in the landscape ( also known as the _ prior _ part ) , the cosmological measure ( which needs a mechanism for populating the landscape ) , and the anthropic factor ( which incorporates the condition for the existence of observers , such as galaxy formation ) .",
    "another problem is the vast complexity of the landscape .",
    "extracting a four - dimensional cosmology from string theory requires choosing a compactification of the remaining dimensions .",
    "each possible choice of compactification describes a sector of the entire landscape , and the number and properties of the states in different sectors can be very different .",
    "this diversity can be explored by considering different sectors separately .",
    "thus , simplified models of some sectors of the landscape have been built , and they constitute a very important tool to understand the full implications of the string theory landscape",
    ". the reader can consult @xcite for a review of several models of the string theory landscape .",
    "for our purposes only the simplest models are needed . among these models we should mention :    * the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) mechanism @xcite is a supersymmetric string model with many stabilized ads vacua which are lifted to ds by quantum effects .",
    "this landscape model gives inflationary states represented by brane - antibrane pairs evolving in klebanov - strassler throats in the compactification manifold .",
    "the model has no classical ds vacua , and thus its more controversial aspect is the quantum nature of the lifting from ads to ds , which is uncontrollable by its very nature .",
    "* the bousso - polchinski ( bp ) model @xcite is a simplified vacuum sector of m theory compactified from eleven to four dimensions with quantized four - form fluxes and m5 branes wrapped around three - cycles in the seven - dimensional compactification manifold .",
    "the volumes of the three - cycles are the moduli of the model , and gives a fundamental charge @xmath6 which determines the cosmological constant of the 3 + 1 cosmological part of the eleven - dimensional metric by the formula @xmath7 here , each @xmath8 is the number of flux units stored in the @xmath9 three - cycle , and @xmath10 is a bare , negative cosmological constant , a parameter of the model .",
    "equation provides a very elegant mechanism to deal with the cosmological constant problem . by choosing a large number @xmath0 of three - cycles",
    ", we can choose the integers @xmath8 to approximately cancel the @xmath10 contribution , thus obtaining a huge landscape of ads and ds vacua containing states with very low values of the effective cosmological constant @xmath5 , also known as the _",
    "discretuum_. calabi - yau compactifications typically have a large amount of three - cycles , so that realistic values of the cosmological constant can be obtained without any fine - tuning of the model parameters .    on one hand , unlike the kklt mechanism , the bp model does not rely on quantum effects for producing ds states . on the other hand ,",
    "bp moduli are frozen from the very beginning , and thus no stabilization mechanism analogous to kklt is included in the bp model .    while there are some extensions of the kklt scenario where the structure of states in the landscape has been elucidated by means of numerical searches @xcite , a very appealing feature of the bp landscape is that the closed expression leads to analytically tractable counting problems .",
    "thus , relative probabilities of different states can be computed based on combinatorics , but this leads to the conclusion that the number of states with realistic @xmath5 values are a very sparse minority , thus opening the door to anthropic arguments @xcite .    if we combine the computation of probabilities by naive state counting with the lack of stability analysis , we find another curious property of the bp landscape . under a large number of three - cycles @xmath0 ,",
    "flux space is a very high - dimensional space .",
    "such spaces have very counterintuitive geometric features : for example , the opposite vertexes of a unit hypercube are separated by a distance @xmath11 , which can be interpreted ( in planck units ) as a huge energy scale .",
    "another consequence of this elongation of diagonal distances is that the vast majority of lattice nodes inside a sphere in flux space are located on hyperplanes , that is , they always have at least one vanishing component .",
    "in fact , we have seen that as @xmath0 grows , the dimension of the most populated hyperplanes is distributed in a narrow gaussian window around a typical value @xmath12 with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "but as the kklt mechanism shows , flux quantum numbers can not vanish in stable states .",
    "of course , the lack of a stabilization mechanism in the bp model prevents us from directly excluding those states from the model ; if they were excluded , the states with very low @xmath5 values could even disappear .",
    "this `` @xmath14-problem '' of the bp model is only present for large @xmath0 , but a large @xmath0 is certainly needed to solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "thus , looking for a scenario where we can closely examine this @xmath14-problem , we are led to consider a model with the following properties :    * it should be exactly solvable .",
    "* it should have many moduli .",
    "* it should have a stabilization mechanism .",
    "the simplest landscape with the first and third requirements is the einstein - maxwell landscape , considered in a plethora of papers as a toy model landscape @xcite .",
    "this landscape has compactifications of the form @xmath15 or @xmath16 having a single modulus , namely , the radius of the compactification sphere .",
    "we have added many moduli by considering compactifications of the form @xmath17 and thus the moduli are the radii of the @xmath0 spheres .",
    "we call this sector _ multi - sphere _ einstein - maxwell compactification",
    ". we will see that ds states with low quantum numbers are always unstable , and thus they should be excluded from the landscape .",
    "this legitimates the @xmath14-problem as an objection against naive counting arguments in the bp landscape .",
    "the stability of states in multi - sphere compactifications has been studied previously @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it is shown that compactifications of the form @xmath18 are unstable for @xmath19 but they are stable for @xmath20 . in contrast",
    ", the multi - sphere model ( [ eq:2 ] ) gives always stable @xmath21 states .",
    "this example emphasizes the importance of the dimensionality in determining stability .",
    "we have chosen the cosmological part in the multi - sphere model to be 1 + 1 instead of 3 + 1 for simplicity .",
    "on one hand , these cosmologies are unrealistic , and they have the peculiarities of two - dimensional dilatonic gravities . on the other hand , there is no theory predicting how observers form in a 1 + 1 universe , and no quantum measure defined on this multiverse , and therefore the prediction of the cosmological constant relies on the state counting problem only .",
    "it is also a good candidate for studying the measure problem in future papers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : one - flux - compactif ] , we give a detailed description of the single - modulus compactification @xmath22 in the einstein - maxwell theory , together with the stabilization mechanism and the state counting . in section [ sec",
    ": many ] we consider the multi - sphere model and its stabilization mechanism in detail , and give a very detailed account of the @xmath23 sector of the six - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "section [ sec : state - counting ] is devoted to counting the states in the model . in section",
    "[ sec : anthropic ] we show how anthropic states can be constructed in this model . in section",
    "[ sec : em - vs - bp ] we summarize the differences found between the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell sector and the bousso - polchinski landscape , and in section [ sec : implications ] we speculate on some consequences that those phenomena can have on the string theory landscape .",
    "the last section [ sec : conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "by a compactification in four - dimensional gravity we understand a solution of the einstein field equations of the form @xmath24 this is a particular expression of a kantowski - sachs cosmology @xcite .",
    "the metric splits in a @xmath25-spacetime part , which we will identify with a two - dimensional cosmological solution , and a @xmath26-surface @xmath27 , the compact part .",
    "the einstein field equations are , in units with @xmath28 , @xmath29 the stress - energy tensor has two contributions , the first comes from the electromagnetic field and the second from a vacuum energy density : @xmath30 the symbol @xmath31 is the electromagnetic lagrangian density , and @xmath10 is the cosmological constant of the four - dimensional theory .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the maxwell field is traceless , so we have @xmath32 we will assume a magnetic monopole configuration for the electromagnetic field : @xmath33 where the boldface is used to denote differential forms .",
    "here the constant @xmath34 is the magnetic charge of the monopole , and @xmath35 is the volume of the compactification manifold , so that @xmath36 and we have @xmath37 in matrix notation , the maxwell field is @xmath38 this configuration solves maxwell equations in curved spacetime @xmath39 and the non - vanishing components of the corresponding stress - energy tensor are @xmath40 the contribution of the cosmological constant is @xmath41 finally , the ricci tensor has the following nonzero components : @xmath42 where the subscripts in @xmath43 etc",
    ".  represent partial derivatives .",
    "einstein equations coincide in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 components , and in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 components also : @xmath48 e^{2\\phi}\\ , , \\\\",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are uncoupled and satisfy liouville equations of @xmath51 and @xmath52 signatures respectively .",
    "the liouville equation states that the gaussian curvature of the corresponding surface is constant .",
    "we will call these two constants @xmath5 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 thus , a solution of the @xmath51 liouville equation @xmath55 represents a two - dimensional spacetime of constant curvature @xmath5 , which is de sitter ( @xmath56 ) if @xmath57 , minkowski ( @xmath58 ) if @xmath59 and anti - de sitter ( @xmath60 ) if @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 can be interpreted as the cosmological constant of the dimensionally reduced cosmological model . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath50 represents a compact surface of constant curvature @xmath53 .",
    "we can choose @xmath53 positive , and then the surface will be a sphere of radius @xmath62 .",
    "the positivity of the constant @xmath53 is equivalent to zero genus by the gauss - bonnet formula , which also relates volume with curvature : @xmath63 which leads to an algebraic equation for @xmath53 : @xmath64 the previous equation has two solutions : @xmath65\\ , ,    \\qquad    q_{\\text{max } } = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\,.\\ ] ] the magnetic charge should not exceed @xmath66 . for greater charges curvatures become complex and",
    "therefore the solution makes no sense .",
    "the two - dimensional cosmological constant has also two branches @xmath67 assuming the usual dirac quantization condition on the magnetic charge in terms of the elemental charge @xmath68 of the particles coupled to the electromagnetic field , @xmath69 we have a maximum value of the integer @xmath70 , @xmath71 and all integers @xmath70 satisfying @xmath72 , plus @xmath73 , constitute the one - flux four dimensional einstein - maxwell landscape .",
    "the case @xmath73 deserves further comment . in this case",
    "we have @xmath74 , and we have only one branch , @xmath75 , which can not be supported because the electromagnetic field vanishes .",
    "thus we should expect this solution to be unstable , as we will see below .",
    "thus far , we have considered @xmath76 . in the case",
    "@xmath77 , it can be seen that the solutions of equation yield @xmath78 and thus only the @xmath79 branch remains as a solution , with a cosmological constant @xmath80 always negative .",
    "in addition we have no restriction in the quantum number @xmath70 , and therefore this @xmath77 infinite landscape is less interesting than its @xmath76 counterpart , which we will be considering henceforth .",
    "equation can be interpreted as a distribution of the @xmath81 curvature @xmath10 between the @xmath82 and @xmath83 parts .",
    "the solutions obtained show that a positive curvature @xmath10 can be distributed between positive @xmath53 and positive or negative @xmath5 ( two possible ways ) , but a negative curvature @xmath10 should be distributed between a positive @xmath53 and a negative @xmath5 ( a unique way ) , yielding a physically less interesting landscape .",
    "figure [ fig : one - flux - em4 ] shows curvatures and cosmological constants for @xmath84 for both branches . note that this number controls the number of the states in the landscape , whereas @xmath10 controls the magnitude of the moduli @xmath53 and @xmath5 .",

    "this is a volume modulus , which control the volume ( surface area ) of the compact part of the spacetime .",
    "the next question we should ask is the stability of the solutions encountered .",
    "if a value of @xmath53 in one of the two branches for fixed quantum number @xmath70 is not stable , a small perturbation will drive the system out of the solution .",
    "if the subsequent evolution makes the sphere radius to grow unbounded we speak of _ decompactification_. an unstable state in the landscape should not be included when counting states in the resulting two - dimensional multiverse .",

    "this reflects that the perturbation exchanges locally volume between the compact and non - compact parts of the metric .",

    "note that the dependence with respect to the dilaton is not relegated to the potential , and so a direct stability analysis using @xmath109 is not possible .",
    "the next step is to show that the euler - lagrange equations of the previous two - dimensional model are equivalent to the einstein equations of its four - dimensional counterpart , that is , the truncation of the model is consistent .",
    "firstly , we recast the lagrangian displaying explicitly all fields and removing the second derivatives of @xmath49 by integrating by parts , which amounts to the substitution @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting lagrangian is @xmath112 the equations of motion are @xmath113 with respect to @xmath100 , and @xmath114 with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the absence of perturbation @xmath115 should be a solution of the equations , so that equation with @xmath115 reduces to @xmath116 which is the two - dimensional cosmological solution , and equation gives @xmath117 which is the same equation previously found for @xmath53 , see .",
    "we will now assume that @xmath100 is a small perturbation , thereby neglecting the backreaction of the perturbation on the geometry of the cosmological solution .",
    "this allows us to fix @xmath49 as another background field by means of equation .",
    "this eliminates @xmath49 as a dynamical variable in the lagrangian and therefore equation will not be used . in other words , we assume that equation is satisfied to zeroth order , which is the content of , and we are left with as the evolution equation for the perturbation @xmath100 in the background @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we substitute eq .   into eq .",
    ", resulting in a dynamical equation for @xmath100 which is @xmath118 the linear stability analysis of equation   requires its linearization ( the effect of neglecting the non - linear derivative term does not spoil linear stability , as discussed in appendix [ sec : deriv - couplings ] ) @xmath119 which is a @xmath108 klein - gordon equation .",
    "we also consider a small spacetime region such that @xmath49 can be treated approximately as a constant .",
    "we thus obtain the linear stability condition of the solution @xmath115 as being a minimum of the effective potential : @xmath120 which is @xmath121 .",

    "this includes also the state @xmath73 , as mentioned above .",
    "we conclude that the flux number labeling true vacuum states should obbey a double inequality , obtained by combining ( [ eq:22 ] ) and ( [ eq:39 ] ) : @xmath126    therefore , the number of stable states in this one - flux landscape is @xmath127 in the example shown in figure [ fig : one - flux - em4 ] we have @xmath128 ( corresponding to @xmath129 ) which gives @xmath130 ( 50 @xmath60 states and only 3 @xmath56 states ) .    the physical description of these states is simple : the self - gravitating electromagnetic field of the monopole stabilizes a geometry @xmath131 whose natural behaviour is decompactification . by inspecting equation , we see that it corresponds to decompactification .",
    "] , that is , the curvature of the sphere part , which tends to vanish , is sustained by the magnetic field .",
    "the distribution of curvature contributions between the compact and non - compact parts of the geometry is whatever allowed by magnetic charge quantization in the @xmath60 case , while in the @xmath56 case only large charges can sustain positive curvature of de sitter states .",
    "obtaining a non - trivial landscape with many fluxes is not easy .",
    "the easiest technique is to extend the electromagnetic field @xmath132 to a @xmath133-invariant @xmath0-component field , in which all charges are different @xcite .",
    "this approach is not convenient to address the problem of stabilization , because the charges do not come from a transparent compactification scheme , and therefore nothing is known about the stabilizing potential .    in",
    "all known compactifications , the charges come from moduli describing the shape of the inner manifold .",
    "these moduli are free geometric parameters , but they are promoted to dynamical scalar fields in the perturbation analysis .",
    "the charges are considered coupling _",
    "constants _ , and therefore their dynamics should be governed by a potential with at least one minimum .",
    "the stabilization problem consists of finding this potential .",
    "different models provide a wide variety of potentials ; if the potential does not possess any minimum , then the dynamics of the moduli will lead them to grow unbounded ; this phenomenon is known as _",
    "decompactification_.    in an ideal model , we should expect that all moduli come from a compactification manifold which is derived from the equations of motion .",
    "nevertheless , these equations are very difficult to solve in its full generality , and therefore the inner manifold is chosen at the very beginning of the process , and its validity is confirmed afterwards , by proving that the chosen ansatz is actually a solution . of course , the chosen manifold may not provide a solution , or the solution may lack some desired properties .    in looking for a many - fluxes landscape , we have tried the following candidates as compactification manifold :    * the complex riemann curves @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are complex coordinates , are the simplest surfaces of known genus @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath138 is a @xmath139-degree polynomial with real coefficients , @xmath140 which are the @xmath141 deformation moduli of the surface .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be removed by rescaling and shifting @xmath136 respectively .",
    "the genus of the surface is given by @xmath144 ( if @xmath139 is even ) or @xmath145 ( if @xmath139 is odd ) .",
    "+ these surfaces are not compact , but they can approximate locally a compact surface of the same genus .",
    "thus , einstein equations are to be solved only locally near the approximation region .",
    "but this ansatz turns out to yield no solutions , not even in this approximate fashion . *",
    "the compact hyperbolic manifolds ( chm ) are fundamental domains of nonabelian lattices in the lobachevskian plane , in which the lattices are generated by discrete subgroups of @xmath146 . by choosing identification of the sides of the fundamental cell a compact surface of genus @xmath147",
    "is obtained , which has constant negative curvature .",
    "these surfaces are indeed solutions of einstein equations , but only if the cosmological constant @xmath10 is _",
    "negative_. this generates a sector of the einstein - maxwell landscape with no de sitter states , and therefore will not be considered here .",
    "the previous examples show that sometimes the appropiate compactification can be elusive , maybe because is far more complex than expected , or because it may not exist .",
    "so we are forced to consider another simple extension of the four dimensional einstein - maxwell landscape , which is discussed in the following subsections .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-sphere metric ansatz given by @xmath148 the metric represents a manifold of the form @xmath149^j\\ ] ] which is nothing but a sector of the einstein - maxwell theory in @xmath150 dimensions .",

    "the most convenient way of obtaining the field equations is writing the action @xmath171 in terms of the fields @xmath49 , @xmath151 and @xmath160 and then derive the equations from it .",

    "based on expression , it follows that whenever @xmath61 the determinant @xmath277 is positive , and furthermore @xmath278 can not vanish at a negative value of @xmath279 , and thus the stability eigenvalue should be positive . as a result , _",
    "all ads states of the model are stable_.    another case worth investigating is those states which have at least a vanishing quantum number @xmath280 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath281 curvature is not defined in this case , because equation is linear and it has only the solution @xmath282 .",
    "thus , we can substitute @xmath283 ( @xmath284 ) in @xmath285 . assuming we can vary independently @xmath5 and @xmath286",
    ", we can expand @xmath277 for small @xmath5 values : @xmath287 the previous expression shows again that a negative value value of @xmath5 can not make this determinant to change sign .",
    "a positive value indeed can change the sign in the determinant , and this indicates that de sitter states are likely to be unstable .",
    "of course no general statement of this sort can be formulated , because this depends on the magnitude of @xmath5 as well as on all @xmath286 : for sufficiently small @xmath57 and fixed @xmath286 , the determinant can be positive .",
    "but if a _ single _",
    "@xmath288 , then the determinant reduces to @xmath289 which is certainly negative for @xmath57 !",

    "we begin by splitting the @xmath263 matrix as follows : @xmath293 where @xmath294 is a @xmath295 matrix filled with ones .",
    "if @xmath5 is small , we can consider the diagonal matrix as a `` dominant '' term and the off - diagonal terms as a perturbation .",

    "but if some curvature is taken from a @xmath299 branch , then we have @xmath300 and the corresponding eigenvalue is negative .",
    "but then @xmath266 should be negative also , showing that no matter how small @xmath5 might be , if the state comes from a non - principal branch , it will be unstable .",
    "the previous argument does not rule out the existence of higher @xmath5 stable ds states in non - principal branches , but our numerical searches have not found them .",
    "once the analysis of the model is reasonably complete , we should ask for concrete examples where we can exhibit some states and their associated magnitudes such as reduced cosmological constant @xmath5 , curvatures @xmath181 and the stability eigenvalue @xmath266 .",
    "we repeat here the relevant equations for the reader s convenience . given a @xmath0-tuple of integers @xmath292 we compute the solutions of equation , which is @xmath301\\,.\\ ] ] all solutions for each branch @xmath302 , where the @xmath303 are signs @xmath304 , should be computed .",
    "the corresponding solutions must be real , and all its curvatures must be real and positive : @xmath305 if a single curvature turns out to be real and negative or complex , then the state should be discarded .",

    "its almost linear relation can be seen to be dispersed in branches , which are the same structures showing up in left panels of figure [ fig : magnitudes - j2 ] . here",
    ", we can see that the states with lower cosmological constant have a `` less negative '' stability eigenvalue than the states with higher @xmath5 , which include the @xmath319 states , as said above .",
    "thus , the different branches provide very different states . among them ,",
    "the most interesting seem to be those coming from the principal branch , because they include ads as well as stable and unstable ds states , which are the ingredients we need to construct a toy model of a multiverse .    for @xmath323",
    ", we can exploit the fact that stable ds states are near the branching hypersurface ( it is a curve only for @xmath308 ) and design a sampling method which looks for states in @xmath324 space whose voronoi cell ( which is the cube with its center at the point in question ) intersects the branching hypersurface .",
    "those states are called _ secant _ states @xcite , and all states near the branching surface belong to this category ( but the reciprocal is false , that is , a secant state may not be near the branching surface if @xmath0 is large enough ! ) .",
    "thus , we can sample the principal branch by sampling the secant states . in this way",
    ", we always find a state with a fair chance of being a true state of the model in the principal branch , that is , we have an efficient sampling method , much better than brute - force node enumeration or completely random node sampling .",
    "the sampling of secant states is simple : we choose a uniformly random direction in @xmath0-space and find the point of intersection between the ray having the chosen direction starting from the origin and the branching hypersurface .",
    "this intersection point belongs to the voronoi cell of a single secant state , which we find by rounding the coordinates of the intersection point .",
    "once we have the state , we solve the equation for @xmath5 in the principal branch and follow the steps detailed above .    in the following section we use this sampling method to obtain a sample of the cosmological constant distribution which can be compared with an approximate formula to be obtained below .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the states of the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell landscape can come from different branches , and the richest of those branches is the principal one . in this section",

    "our main aim is to compute the distribution of cosmological constant values in this branch .",
    "as discussed above , only the principal branch can have both ads and ds states , both stable and unstable , and moreover the large-@xmath0 sampling method is especially adapted to the principal branch .",
    "therefore , we can obtain samples to compare with the approximate formula to be obtained in subsection [ sec : small - cc - distribution ] below .      given a node @xmath325 in @xmath0-space",

    ", we will represent this condition by adding the factor @xmath339 to the existence condition .",

    "prior to that , we need to grasp some general ideas on the structure of the stable state set which we are willing to count .",
    "we will emphasize two main aspects : asymptotic hyperplanes and state chains .",
    "asymptotic hyperplanes : :    both equations and corresponding to the branching and limiting    surfaces , and likewise the stability surface , have asymptotic    hyperplanes located at @xmath342 and thus all states are restricted to    the region @xmath343 therefore , all ds states should have a    charge greater than @xmath344 as a necessary condition .",
    "+    note that no integer @xmath221 can be equal to    @xmath344 while preserving the existence condition unless    all the remaining integers @xmath345 are infinite , hence the name `` asymptotic '' .",
    "it is easy to    see that the corresponding states would have @xmath59    and all curvatures vanishing except for one , and thus they would not    represent compactified states .",
    "moreover , the associated stability    matrix has @xmath346 zero eigenvalues ( see eq .  ) , and thus    these states are only marginally stable .",
    "these properties suggest that    they should be excluded from the landscape .",
    "state chains : :    there is also a natural upper bound on the charge , which can be    obtained by considering the following straight line in flux space :    @xmath347 the    previous line is asymptotic to the branching surface , in the sense    that it satisfies equation when @xmath348 .",
    "this line    do not contain nodes because the quotient    @xmath349 is generically not an    integer .",
    "but we can slightly modify the previous line :    @xmath350 this    modified line can contain valid states if @xmath351 lies    between @xmath352 and @xmath353 , where    @xmath353 is the intersection height with the branching    surface : @xmath354 all states on the line above @xmath353 are    beyond the branching surface .",
    "therefore , we have the bound    @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "all states which might happen to lie on this line are    said to form a _ state chain_.    +    it should be noted that when @xmath349    coincides with the integer @xmath357 , then    @xmath353 diverges , which at first sight would be    interpreted as an infinite ds state chain of ever decreasing    @xmath5 .",
    "but those nodes in the chains have no states ,    as can be seen by explicitly writing equation for the nodes in the    line , and look for solutions with small @xmath5 and    large @xmath351 : @xmath358 we can    consider @xmath359 , but    @xmath360 is not true , because @xmath351 is large .    therefore , equation can be rewritten as @xmath361 the right hand    side of is positive , thus a solution to equation can exist only if    @xmath362 is strictly positive , which leads to    @xmath363 that is , if    @xmath349 is an integer then there is    no solution to equation . as a consequence , @xmath353 can be    made as large as we want by fine - tuning @xmath10 but it    is never infinite .",
    "this argument shows that all state chains are    finite .",
    "+    this discussion on the state chains can be generalized to other    asymptotic affine manifolds that the branching surface can have . for    instance",
    ", asymptotic hyperplanes , as we have seen above , are likewise    devoid of states , but there are close hyperplanes ( having nodes ) each    one containing a replica of a @xmath271-dimensional    landscape .",
    "we will now consider the evaluation of the number of stable states @xmath364 .",
    "firstly , we get rid of the sign degeneracy @xmath225 , which is always trivially present .",
    "secondly , we invoke the permutation symmetry , which allows us to arrange the integers @xmath221 in decreasing order .",
    "the corresponding permutation degeneracy is @xmath365 except on those nodes having repeated components .",
    "this difference will be ignored for simplicity ; we will see below that it will be of little importance in the small-@xmath5 region .",
    "thirdly , we consider a node @xmath366 with @xmath367 and the corresponding equation for the existence of a state : @xmath368 =    \\lambda \\,.\\ ] ] the @xmath329 curve has a branching point @xmath369 given by , that is , @xmath370 .",
    "any approximation method we might wish to apply on the @xmath329 curve should respect this branching point in order to accurately represent the existence condition .",
    "in particular , we can not assume @xmath371 .",
    "but we do have @xmath372 , and in the case @xmath373 , we can assume @xmath374 and write @xmath375 which leaves equation as @xmath376 =    \\lambda - \\frac{1}{n_j^2}\\,.\\ ] ] equation represents the solutions of a landscape in which the @xmath377 curvature has been removed , and the cosmological constant @xmath10 has been replaced with @xmath378 .",
    "we can now let @xmath351 run from @xmath379 through the diagonal node having @xmath380 , thus obtaining the recurrence law @xmath381 the previous formula is valid under the following conditions :    * the fraction of states with repeated components is small . *",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath5 of the states included is small , so that equation can be valid .",
    "the states near the asymptotic hyperplanes will satisfy the previous conditions more accurately , so that the first terms in the sum will be more precise than the terms near the diagonal .",
    "the latter states will fail to satisfy the strong inequality @xmath382 .",
    "this means that the low - lying ( that is , small-@xmath5 ) states will be taken into account , but the formula can miss or overcount some high - lying ( high-@xmath5 ) states .",
    "equation triggers the recurrence relation , the first consequence being @xmath383 the previous equation can be approximated by a smoother version by removing the floor - ceiling functions inside the sum : @xmath384 the previous formula can be refined by cutting off the chains whose lower ends pass the diagonal and counting the states on the diagonal accurately .",
    "this `` diagonal corrected '' formula is to be used in figures [ fig : n2-vs - lambda - j2 ] and [ fig : n2-vs - lambda - j2-half ] below .",
    "further simplification can be achieved by isolating the first term ( which carries the discontinuities ) and estimating the remaining sum by means of an integral : @xmath385 formulae and show clearly the effect of state chains as discontinuities at integer values of @xmath386 .",

    "these formulae are to be compared with brute - force determination of the number of stable states in the corresponding models .",

    "such states are devoid of matter , of course , and thus no real observers can live in such universes . nevertheless , as a toy model of a multiverse",
    ", a natural question one may ask is if anthropic states are present in this model , that is , if states with very low , realistic effective cosmological constant exist , and if they are generic , or some fine - tuning is needed to obtain them . we have seen above that special values of @xmath10 can yield particularly small values of @xmath5 , but a huge amount of fine - tuning is needed to obtain a realistic value . surprisingly enough , anthropic states _ do _ exist indeed , and this section is devoted to describe how to find and count them .",
    "we also draw some conclusions regarding the multiverse prediction of the cosmological constant with these anthropic states in mind .",
    "we start by considering equation ( [ eq:101 ] ) for the branching surface , which is the @xmath59 locus .",
    "we can try to solve this equation by successive approximations , looking for the best choice of an integer at each step in a greedy fashion : @xmath458 we have called @xmath459 for the start of a recurrence relation replicating the previous step : @xmath460 the recurrence relation ( [ eq:168 ] ) gives the best integer choice at each step for getting the smallest possible difference between the two sides of the formula @xmath461 the last step of the approximation is @xmath462 that is , the last remainder should be negative , so that the existence condition ( [ eq:103 ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "this gives the last integer as @xmath463 where the floor function is taken instead of the ceiling to guarantee that the last remainder is negative .",
    "thus , we can run the recurrence relation ( [ eq:168 ] ) starting from any positive value of @xmath464 until some desired number of steps @xmath0 is reached , and then finish it with the last step ( [ eq:171 ] ) .    before the final step closes the algorithm , we can rewrite the recurrence relation as a fixed - point iteration : @xmath465 the iteration function just defined @xmath466 has jump discontinuities when @xmath386 is an integer , and",
    "it is simply @xmath467 if @xmath468 .",
    "its continuous envelope , which is easily obtained replacing @xmath469 with @xmath470 , gives the magnitude of the jumps , and it has a particularly attractive behaviour when @xmath471 : @xmath472 the iteration function , its envelope and its first - order term are plotted in figure [ fig : iteration - function ] .",
    "the figure also shows the first - quadrant diagonal , thereby proving that the only fixed point of the recurrence is at @xmath473 .    ) .",
    "it is shown along with its envelope and its first - order taylor approximation , which is used as upper bound in equation ( [ eq:174 ] ) .",
    "the first quadrant diagonal is also drawn , showing that the only fixed point of the iteration is at @xmath474.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the super - linear behaviour of @xmath475 near @xmath471 has the nice consequence of giving the recurrence relation a very fast convergence rate .",
    "this can be seen by replacing @xmath475 by its first - order approximation , which is an upper bound : @xmath476 the resulting approximate recurrence relation is exactly solvable , and its solution starting from @xmath464 is @xmath477 thus , as long as @xmath478 , the previous upper bound decreases at a double - exponential rate , thus providing very small values of the negative remainder @xmath479 when the last step is taken for moderate values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have thus a recipe for obtaining a node @xmath292 with the property of being an approximate solution of the branching surface equation with a very small negative remainder .",
    "nevertheless , it should be shown that both inequalities of the existence condition ( [ eq:103 ] ) are satisfied , because only one of them is guaranteed by the last step ( [ eq:171 ] ) .",
    "the solution of the existence equation ( [ eq:102 ] ) should be smaller that the branching point @xmath369 , which in this case is @xmath480 equation ( [ eq:171 ] ) guarantees that @xmath481 , thus it remains to show that @xmath482 .",
    "the @xmath327 function evaluated at @xmath369 is @xmath483 the convergence rate of the approximate recurrence relation ( [ eq:174 ] ) is so fast that the integers @xmath221 grow in such a way that @xmath351 is overwhelmingly larger than the rest , and thus all square roots in equation ( [ eq:177 ] ) can be approximated by first - order taylor expansions , except for the last , which is zero : @xmath484    + \\frac{1}{2n_j^2 }    = \\sum_{j=1}^{j}\\frac{1}{n_j^2 } - \\frac{1}{4n_j^2}\\,.\\ ] ] the difference with @xmath10 is @xmath485 where the last inequality follows from the recurrence relation at its final step , because @xmath486 is much smaller than @xmath487 .",

    "this @xmath248 em landscape has been obtained by fixing the integers @xmath493 by means of the recurrence relation ( [ eq:168 ] ) .",
    "the last integer @xmath351 , if chosen as in ( [ eq:171 ] ) , gives the last node verifying the existence equation .",
    "we know that no greater value of @xmath351 will satisfy the existence equation , but smaller values can also give valid solutions .",
    "thus , varying @xmath351 downwards from ( [ eq:171 ] ) provides us with a state chain embedded in the @xmath0-sphere em landscape : this state chain is simply the single - sphere em landscape described by equation ( [ eq:181 ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath248 em landscape performed in subsections [ sec : one - flux ] , [ sec : modulus - stab ] and [ sec : small - cc - distribution ] is now entirely applicable to ( [ eq:181 ] ) . in particular , the exact minimum two - dimensional cosmological constant of this chain is given by equation ( [ eq:135 ] ) ( with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath487 ) or by its continuum approximation given in equation ( [ eq:141 ] ) ( with the same replacement ) : @xmath494 we know that @xmath487 is very small , and we now see that @xmath495 is even smaller .",
    "the stability condition for the @xmath248 landscape ( [ eq:133 ] ) reads @xmath496 .",
    "we can see that @xmath497 , and thus this minimum-@xmath5 state is always stable .",
    "moreover , we can let @xmath351 decrease until it reaches the stability limit .",
    "this generates all ds stable states in the chain , whose number is given by ( [ eq:108 ] ) , which is @xmath498 this is an enormous number , as we now see .",
    "we will choose a reference value @xmath499 , and we wish @xmath495 to reach it .",
    "we can compute the value of @xmath0 we need for this to happen by inserting the worst - case approximate formula ( [ eq:175 ] ) in equation ( [ eq:182 ] ) for the minimum @xmath5 value : @xmath500 }    \\lambda^{\\frac{5}{4}(\\frac{3}{2})^{j-1}}\\,.\\ ] ] solving for @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath501 we can also demand a much more restrictive condition , that the whole chain is inside the anthropic range .",
    "the peak of the density is located at @xmath502 , and thus the relation @xmath503 together with ( [ eq:175 ] ) leads to a value of @xmath0 given by @xmath504 using the emblematic number @xmath505 and @xmath506 , we obtain a non - integer @xmath507 with the first formula and @xmath508 with the second ; using @xmath509 we find @xmath510 states in the chain with a minimum of order @xmath511 . in this case , the stability limit is around @xmath512 , well inside the anthropic range . as another example , starting from @xmath513 , we obtain @xmath514 almost exactly with the first formula and @xmath515 states .",
    "the second formula provides @xmath516 , and with @xmath517 we obtain @xmath518 states .    therefore , we can see that moderate values of @xmath0 and @xmath10 can yield an enormous number of anthropic states in the multi - sphere em landscape .",
    "we may ask if the states just found are generic inside the @xmath0-dimensional landscape , because the recurrence relation ( [ eq:168 ] ) , ( [ eq:171 ] ) leading to them gives very precise values for the integers @xmath292 , and therefore they seem to be located at a very special place in flux space . we will now see that , despite being very numerous , these anthropic states are not generic .",
    "we have just obtained a very long state chain by fixing @xmath519 and letting @xmath351 to vary from ( [ eq:171 ] ) downwards .",
    "this state chain is a one - dimensional landscape embedded in @xmath0-dimensional flux space .",
    "we can let @xmath520 vary downwards as well , thus generating a two - dimensional landscape embedded in @xmath0-dimensional flux space .",
    "the effective high - dimensional cosmological constant of this landscape is @xmath521 , and it is very small , which allows us to use formula ( [ eq:123 ] ) with the approximation ( [ eq:124 ] ) to give the number of states of this two - dimensional landscape as @xmath522 where we have used that @xmath523 .",
    "the first contribution in formula ( [ eq:186 ] ) , @xmath351 , comes from the longest state chain , while the second , @xmath524 , comes from the bulk .",
    "the simplified recurrence ( [ eq:174 ] ) shows that @xmath525 , that is , the number of states in the chain scales as @xmath526 while the number of states in the bulk scales as @xmath524 .",
    "thus , the fraction of states in this two - dimensional landscape belonging to the chain scales as @xmath527 , and therefore they are non - generic .    for example , choosing @xmath528 and @xmath514 we obtain @xmath529 , but @xmath530 .",
    "thus , states in the chain are in a proportion @xmath531",
    ".    we may as well let the remainder of the integers @xmath532 vary downwards from ( [ eq:168 ] ) , thus generating the entire @xmath0-dimensional landscape . in this complete landscape the proportion will be much smaller than @xmath527 , and thus we see that anthropic states are very rare , despite being very numerous .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that other corners of flux space may contain low-@xmath5 states , either as isolated , randomly close nodes , or as very long chains obtained in a different way , but they will be non - generic also .    summarizing , we have seen that for any value of @xmath10 ( say , between @xmath533 and @xmath534 ) moderate values of @xmath0 ( between 10 and 15 respectively ) lead to the existence of a huge chain of anthropic states , that is , states having a two - dimensional cosmological constant of order @xmath535 .",
    "those states represent a tiny fraction of the total number of states , and thus they are non - generic .",
    "but they are very numerous , and they can be found with no fine tuning at all , which is a very remarkable feature of the multi - sphere em landscape .",
    "the very long chains of anthropic states found in the previous subsection are another form of the discretuum introduced by bousso and polchinski @xcite as part of the solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "moderate values of @xmath0 can yield a 1 + 1 effective cosmological constant of the order of the observed value in our universe .",
    "the only parameter of the model , @xmath10 , can be chosen as any positive real number to achieve that .",
    "thus , the multi - sphere em landscape do not need fine - tuning @xmath10 to contain anthropic states in the discretuum .",
    "there are another possibilities to produce a discretuum .",
    "a very small charge produces a finely spaced tower of states as in the brown - teitelboim mechanism @xcite , or a number of different , incommensurable elemental charges can yield a bp - like discretuum . in the first case , a single ,",
    "very small parameter is needed , while in the multi - sphere em model the parameter is not restricted at all . in the second case ,",
    "as commented above , a number of parameters are given from the start , thus bypassing the need for a stabilization mechanism .",
    "this mechanism works only for large @xmath0 , which are easily obtained in some calabi - yau compactification scenarios , but large values of @xmath0 give rise to the @xmath14-problem discussed in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "thus , no fine - tuning is needed in such cases , but the counting of states becomes tricky , because most of them might be unstable if its stability were correctly addressed , as is demonstrated in the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell model .",
    "thus , we conclude that , as a discretuum - generating method , state chains circumvent some previously encountered problems .",
    "anthropic state chains have further implications in the prediction of the cosmological constant distribution in realistic landscapes . as stated in section [ sec : intro ] , a multiverse prediction of the cosmological constant requires a prior probability distribution counting the states present in the model , a cosmological measure to weigh relative probabilities , and an anthropic factor taking into account the existence of observers @xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite state that the prediction is very sensitive to changes in the prior distribution , so we may wonder how state chains can change the prediction .",
    "the current multiverse prediction of the cosmological constant assumes that the prior distribution has a scale of variation of order the planck scale , which is enormous when compared with the anthropic range .",
    "thus it is safe to consider that the prior distribution is almost constant in the anthropic range , and the cosmological constant prediction is dominated by the anthropic factor .",
    "the anthropic range , also called `` weinberg window '' , is an interval of values of the cosmological constant which allow the formation of structures , such as galaxies , which may contain observers like us .",
    "the order of magnitude of such an interval is large when compared with the observed value of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "thus , if the prior probability has a very narrow peak inside the anthropic range of width comparable to the observed value @xmath536 , then the anthropic factor , varying on a much larger scale , can be considered as almost constant . therefore , the prediction of the cosmological constant would be dominated by the prior distribution .",
    "this is precisely the case with anthropic chains in the multi - sphere em model .",
    "obviously , an anthropic factor is entirely out of question in the context of a 1 + 1 cosmology .",
    "thus , the prior distribution will dominate the prediction if anthropic state chains can be shown to exist in a multi - sphere em model with a 3 + 1 cosmology .",
    "the construction of such a model is left as future work .",
    "obviously , the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell landscape can not be considered as a model of the string theory landscape , because it belongs to a completely different family of theories .",
    "nevertheless , the features we have described in the previous sections are not excluded from the string theory landscape , and they are qualitatively different in other simplified models , such as the bousso - polchinski ( bp ) landscape @xcite",
    ". we will now provide a brief summary of the main features of the bp landscape , and then we will stress the differences with the multi - sphere em landscape .",
    "the bp landscape is a simplified model which provides an elegant method for solving the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the starting point is m - theory , which is formulated in 10 + 1 dimensions , compactified down to 3 + 1 .",
    "one of the main ingredients of this theory is a seven - form , which is used to introduce the brown - teitelboim cosmological constant neutralization mechanism @xcite , which is a generalization of the schwinger pair creation process responsible for the spontaneous lowering of a strong electric field .    in the presence of a compactification manifold",
    "having three - cycles , the seven - form is expanded in a basis of harmonic three - forms , whose coefficients are four - forms . after dimensional reduction , the four - dimensional duals of the four - forms are zero - forms , that is , scalars , which are quantized by virtue of generalized dirac quantization conditions .",
    "the total value of the flux of a four - form in the @xmath537 three - cycle is an integer multiple of a fundamental charge @xmath538 which is proportional to the volume of the three - cycle .",
    "these charges are moduli of the theory , whose stabilization is given _ a priori _ in the bp model .",
    "a vacuum state of this model is given by specifying the integers representing the value of the four - form flux stored in each three - cycle . transitions between the states are mediated by instantons , which can be viewed as m5-brane bubbles with two `` legs '' enclosing a three - dimensional interior of a different vacuum energy density , while having three remaining `` legs '' wrapping the flux in a three - cycle .",
    "thus , the vacuum states of the model are arranged in the nodes of a lattice in flux space .",
    "a given state is specified by @xmath0 integers @xmath539 , whose effective cosmological constant @xmath5 is given by @xmath540 in equation , @xmath0 represents the number of three - cycles inside the compactification manifold ; @xmath10 is the bare cosmological constant of the theory , which should be negative , so that @xmath5 can reach a small value ; and @xmath538 are the moduli , that is , the elementary charges of the fluxes .",
    "there is a minkowski surface in flux space separating ads and ds states , which is obtained by setting @xmath59 in .",
    "a node of the lattice can be located very close to this surface , and the number of such nodes can be huge by choosing a large enough @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of these nodes , randomly close to the @xmath59 surface , is essentially the bp mechanism solving the cosmological constant problem .    in a bp landscape with a large amount of fluxes ,",
    "the vast majority of the nodes are located far away from the origin .",
    "some criterion is needed to limit the value of the integers @xmath221 and render the landscape finite .",
    "usually , this is accomplished by introducing a cut - off @xmath541 in flux space which characterizes the maximum value of @xmath5 to be possibly reached .",
    "the computation of the probability of a given state among all available states based on abundance of states gives very small values for a large @xmath0 , and a large @xmath0 is needed to reach a value of @xmath5 as low as the observed value @xmath535 @xcite .",
    "so this model has the necessary states , but a very low probability for them to be occupied , which leads to anthropic arguments .",
    "the anthropic window is an interval of cosmological constant values which allow the formation of observed structures ( like galaxies , stars and planets ) @xcite . even inside this anthropic window ,",
    "the number of states is so huge that the probability of a state having @xmath542 is tiny .",
    "dynamical relaxation inside the bp landscape reduces the states to a shell wider than the anthropic window @xcite , and thus do not solve this problem .",
    "this requires less convincing anthropic arguments to explain the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "we can rephrase this problem by saying that the distribution of @xmath5 values near @xmath59 is flat @xcite , and thus specially small values do not get rewarded .",
    "the observed value of @xmath5 lies in a very thin shell , very small when compared with the anthropic or dynamically relaxed shells .",
    "thus , the flatness of the distribution gives rise to such small probabilities .",
    "in addition , there is another complication with large values of @xmath0 .",
    "when the dimension of flux space is large , the vast majority of states in _ any _ spherical shell are confined to coordinate hyperplanes with a dimension of near @xmath543 with @xmath544 @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the spherical shell is almost devoid of states , and the number of non - vanishing fluxes is generically less than @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , stability arguments often force the integers @xmath221 to be nonzero , even large ones ; this would dramatically lower the number of states in the bp landscape , resulting in an empty anthropic shell .",
    "this @xmath14-problem of the bp landscape is not restricted to sets with spherical symmetry ; secant states are not spherically distributed , and share the same problem .",
    "the previously described features of the bp landscape contrast with their counterparts in the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell landscape .",
    "first of all , this landscape is derived from a @xmath150-dimensional theory , after its dimensional reduction to 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "therefore , the resulting cosmologies are not comparable .",
    "nevertheless , we will focus in the distribution of states and qualitative features of the landscape .",
    "the `` bare '' cosmological constant @xmath10 is negative in the bp case , allowing cancellation in the effective cosmological constant @xmath5 ; if @xmath10 were positive , no ads nor low - lying ds states would longer exist . in the em case",
    ", @xmath10 should be positive ; otherwise , ds states would not exist at all .",
    "thus , both landscapes have twin versions with reversed @xmath10 which are not physically interesting .",
    "the bp model assumes that its moduli are frozen by some external , unspecified mechanism .",
    "therefore , the elementary charges are parameters of the model , as well as @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the moduli of the em theory , which are the radii of the internal spheres , are fixed ( at least at a linear level ) by an effective potential built from the magnetic field , the curvatures and the vacuum energy density .",
    "thus , this theory needs only one parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "it is generally believed that the same stabilization mechanism should work in the bp model , but as far as we know it has not been implemented yet .    the simplicity of the formula for @xmath5 in the bp model , , is to be compared with the equation determining @xmath5 in the em model , , or . in this equation",
    ", @xmath5 can not be isolated in general , and there are several branches for each node . nevertheless , only the principal branch has solutions with positive curvatures , and these are the only ones with a chance of being stable .",
    "moreover , this equation can have zero , one or two solutions , depending on @xmath10 , giving zero , one or two states per node in flux space .",
    "in contrast , always has one solution , and no more , per node .",
    "thus , the correspondence between nodes and states is one - to - one in the bp model , but this is not the case in the em model .",
    "the finiteness of the bp landscape is a consequence of a cutoff introduced in flux space . as commented above , were this cutoff absent , the theory would have an infinite family of states with infinitely high-@xmath10 , which would raise the problem of choosing initial conditions .",
    "the em model has a finite amount of stable ds states because of the presence of a branching point in the equation determining @xmath5 .",
    "the number of unstable ds states is much greater , but these states are excluded from the landscape .",
    "thus , the stability analysis gets rid of the majority of ds states , and so we expect this situation to be analogous in the bp model completed with a stability analysis .",
    "this ingredient can thus significantly change a lot the general properties of the bp model , because it would exclude a huge amount of states from the landscape .",
    "this might be a feature , though , because it might raise the probability for the system to be in an anthropic state , which is currently very small because of the enormous amount of ds states present .",
    "but it is impossible to establish this claim or the opposite without a well - defined model to work with .",
    "ads states are finite in number in the bp model , because they are located inside a sphere in flux space . in the em model with @xmath545 there is an infinite number of them and they are always stable .",
    "therefore , the probabilistic arguments based on the number of states can not be applied here , because the probability of ds states would always be zero .",
    "this argument might be interpreted as indicating that the method of computing probabilities using simply amounts of states could be completely wrong in both models . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability measure used in these landscapes should be revised from scratch .",
    "both models have a @xmath59 surface separating ds from ads states , which in the bp model is @xmath546 that is , a sphere in flux space ( parametrized in @xmath547 coordinates ) , while in the em model it is @xmath548 which is a sphere after performing a coordinate inversion .",
    "these surfaces provide the bp mechanism for solving the cosmological constant problem : if the landscape contains a state randomly close to this surface then this state can have a realistic value of @xmath5 .",
    "both models have this property . nevertheless , the surface is not compact , and it allows for long state chains whose cosmological constant can approach very small values .",
    "this phenomenon is absent in the bp model , and constitutes a basic difference because it increases the amount of states in the anthropic shell . as stated above , we do nt know the correct way of computing probabilities , but state chains provide a new source of low - lying states which is absent in the bp model .",
    "state chains are also responsible for a crucial modification in the distribution of @xmath5 values , which is flat near @xmath59 in the bp case , as stated above . in the em case",
    ", the @xmath549 density vanishes at @xmath59 , but it has a huge peak of small values , corresponding precisely to those lying in the state chains .",
    "thus , this distribution is not flat , which means that the randomly - close - state mechanism is less important in the em model than in the bp case , because only states near the diagonal in flux space contribute to it , while all states near the sphere contribute in the bp case , accounting for the difference .",
    "state chains provide a dominant peak of small @xmath5 values , which is another different mechanism for solving the cosmological constant problem .",
    "this mechanism can provide a peak very near @xmath59 for very specific values of @xmath10 when @xmath0 is small ( namely , when @xmath386 is very close to an integer from below ) , or for generic @xmath10 values when @xmath0 is moderate @xmath550 , leading even to anthropic states .",
    "thus , both mechanisms are different , and both have states with very small values of the cosmological constant , but they differ deeply in the form of the @xmath549 distribution .",
    "finally , the @xmath14-problem is absent in the em model , because the @xmath59 surface never approaches the coordinate hyperplanes where one or more @xmath280 .",
    "thus , if the stability results found in the em model translate to the bp model completed with a stability analysis , then we are forced to conclude that the vast majority of ds states , which are near the hyperplanes , would be unstable , and thus there would be excluded from the bp landscape .",
    "this would change all reasoning based on number of states , if it were to be of any use .",
    "table [ tab : diff - bp - msem ] summarizes all the issues we have addressed while comparing the bp and em landscapes .",
    "the comparison carried out in the previous section leads to some features that a complete treatment of the bp landscape interpreted as a toy model of the true string theory landscape would bear when compared to what is currently believed .",
    "this section is devoted to envision what the bp landscape would look like if some of the main features of the em landscape were found to hold .",
    "two key points should be stressed :    * theories with four - form fluxes have duals which are gauge - gravity theories . the main difference between them",
    "is that gauge - gravity theories have a built - in cut - off mechanism which limits the maximum values of the integers characterizing the landscape .",
    "thus , those landscapes have natural finiteness conditions , such as the branching point in the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell landscape .",
    "this would avoid the neccessity of a cut - off scale put by hand in the model . nevertheless , the kktl model has some natural cut - off mechanisms built - in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* stability conditions are important not only beacuse they complete the model , but also because they exclude a huge amount of states from the model .",
    "if the same exclusion were to take place in the bp landscape , the vast majority of its nodes would not be true states of the landscape , and the predictions of existence of anthropic states would dramatically change .",
    "thus , stability conditions have a two - fold purpose : on the one hand they fix the values of the elementary charges to be used in the model , on the other hand they limit which nodes have physically relevant states .",
    "a priori frozen moduli fulfill the first purpose , but do not help in deciding which nodes have states .",
    "this causes a huge proliferation of states , which may be spurious ones .",
    "the em model shows that the vast majority of ds states are unstable .",
    "thus , we can expect the same to be true in a completed bp landscape .",
    "other features of the em landscape may not have a direct translation to a completed bp model , such as state chains .",
    "they are a consequence of the asymptotes found in the null-@xmath5 surface , which is non - compact .",
    "this is an indication that the details of the null-@xmath5 surface provide different sources of low - lying states which change the density of states @xmath549 .",
    "this distribution is needed when one has to compute probabilities in a given landscape model ; but a completely clear , unambiguous , quantum prescription for computing probabilities with a general model is still lacking , and therefore the implications of the details of @xmath549 in the computation of probabilities can not go beyond the naive arguments based on state abundances . at this simple level ,",
    "details of the null-@xmath5 surface translate in peaks in the @xmath549 density , thus producing very different probabilities for the states in the anthropic shell .",
    "the bp model has a spherical null-@xmath5 surface , and thus @xmath549 has no peaks ; if the null-@xmath5 surface of more realistic flux compactifications of m - theory had other nontrivial shapes , this would be reflected in the @xmath549 distribution and in the final computation of the probabilities .",
    "so this is the last point that the em landscape brings in : the details of the null-@xmath5 surface are very important for probability computations .",
    "we have addressed a simple sector of the einstein - maxwell theory as an exactly solvable model of a landscape .",
    "the theory , formulated in @xmath150 spacetime dimensions , has a single parameter in the lagrangian , namely , the `` bare '' cosmological constant @xmath76 .",
    "the compactification has the form @xmath551 , which is referred to as _ multi - sphere einstein - maxwell _ compactification .",
    "equations of motion for the corresponding metric ansatz are algebraic equations for the values of the curvatures of the inner spheres and the effective cosmological constant @xmath5 of the cosmological part . in the presence of a magnetic monopole , the magnetic flux in each sphere , which is quantized by a dirac condition ,",
    "stabilizes the configuration which spontaneously would decompactify .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath10 helps to evade the maldacena - nuez no - go theorem in this case @xcite .",
    "the different combinations of the flux quanta stored in the spheres give rise to a complicated landscape , in which each configuration of integers ( called a _ node _ ) can host a true stable state of the model , two stable states , an unstable state and a stable one , or no state , giving rise to two branches of ( ads and ds ) states .",
    "it is found that for @xmath338 an infinite family of stable ads states exist , but stable ds states exist only near the _ branching surface _ , which is the locus at which both branches meet , that is , the null-@xmath5 surface .",
    "the structure of the null-@xmath5 surface gives rise to the state chains , which provide a different source of low - lying states besides the randomly close states which help to solve the cosmological constant problem in the bousso - polchinski landscape .",
    "state chains also help in counting states approximately , and they translate in peaks in the density of states @xmath549 , providing anthropic states for moderately large values of @xmath0",
    ".    all the previous features of the model are qualitatively different from its counterparts in the bousso - polchinski landscape .",
    "we think that in a completed bp model , all these differences would render a very different picture with respect to the number of states , probabilities and anthropic reasoning .",
    "thus , despite not being a realistic landscape model , the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell model has very appealing features that might propagate in more realistic models of the true string theory landscape .",
    "the account of the multi - sphere einstein - maxwell model given in this paper has three main limitations : firstly , it is difficult to extrapolate the stability conditions found from 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions to a more realistic 3 + 1 cosmology .",
    "secondly , we have considered a restricted class of linear perturbations ; the inclusion of fully general linear perturbations could render unstable some states which are stable .",
    "the combination of the two ingredients , that is , 3 + 1 cosmology and a full set of linear perturbations , can lead to a qualitatively very different sector of the einstein - maxwell landscape .",
    "finally , a fundamental missing piece is the cosmological measure .",
    "this problem and the construction of the corresponding model will be addressed in future papers .",
    "we would like to thank concha orna for carefully reading this manuscript , and the pedro pascual benasque center of science .",
    "we also thank frederik denef , roberto emparan , jaume garriga , bert janssen , donald marolf and jorge zanelli for useful discussions and encouragement . this work has been supported by cicyt",

    "we thank also the support by grant a9335/10 ( fsica de alta energa : partculas , cuerdas y cosmologa ) .",
    "in this appendix we give a heuristic argument leading to the conclusion that the linear stability analysis of the multi - radion field evolution equations , equation  , which is achieved by neglecting the derivative couplings , can be promoted to a non - linear stability analysis in which the linear stability is preserved as long as perturbation amplitudes are sufficiently small .    to begin with , we consider again equation : @xmath552    =     \\lambda - e^{-2\\sum_k\\xi_k } u'_j(\\xi_j)\\,.\\ ] ] the derivative couplings appear in a quadratic form .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath262 to denote the @xmath0-component column vector of the perturbations @xmath258 , and then we will write the derivative couplings in matrix form as @xmath553    =     \\lambda - e^{-2\\sum_k\\xi_k } u'_j(\\xi_j)\\,,\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath295 matrix @xmath554 has the number @xmath555 along the diagonal except for 1 along the @xmath556 row and @xmath556 column and zeroes elsewhere : @xmath557 the matrix @xmath554 has a spectrum with two simple eigenvalues @xmath558 and a @xmath559-degenerate @xmath555 eigenvalue .",
    "it is therefore an `` almost negative - definite '' quadratic form , which represents a non - linear force .",
    "we are interested in the effect of the derivative couplings ; therefore , we approximate the system of equations by taylor - expanding to first order the right - hand side of equation , thus considering the much simpler system ( written in matrix form ) @xmath560    =     -\\sum_{k } h_{jk}\\xi_k\\,,\\ ] ] where the frequency matrix @xmath263 is given by equation in section [ sec : moduli - stab ] .    as said above , a complete analysis of the system is not possible , but we can form a single equation out of it by projecting the system of equations along a constant direction @xmath561 : @xmath562    = -\\langle\\mathbf{w},h\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\rangle    \\,.\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath563 is @xmath564 any solution of the system is a solution of equation , but the reciprocal is false .",
    "nevertheless , we can look for normal modes of the form @xmath565 for constant @xmath566 and a single scalar function @xmath567 : @xmath568    = -\\langle\\mathbf{w},h\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon}\\rangle\\chi    \\,.\\ ] ] taking @xmath569 and @xmath570 for simplicity , we obtain @xmath571    = -\\frac{\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon},h\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon}\\rangle }    { \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon},\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon}\\rangle}\\chi    \\,.\\ ] ] if the non - linear term were absent , we would have a simple oscillator equation with a frequency given by the rayleigh quotient of the matrix @xmath263 .",
    "the solution of this equation would be a solution of the linear system if @xmath566 were chosen as an eigenmode of @xmath263 . in this sense",
    ", the projected equation is an _ average _ equation , and its solution ( a _ weak _ solution henceforth ) can indicate the behavior of the true solutions we are inspecting .",
    "of course , this is a heuristic argument , but we can argue that true solutions provide weak solutions ; thus , an unstable true solution should be reflected by an unstable weak solution .",
    "this argument has the obstacle of the existence of the normal modes we are using as ansatz ; thus , as long as the normal modes constitute a reasonable description of the system , the projected equation will reflect accurately the character of its non - linear counterpart .",
    "we will rewrite equation as @xmath572 the parameter @xmath434 depends on the projection direction @xmath566 but not on time .",
    "in contrast , @xmath573 depends also on time by the presence of the @xmath574 factor . we will now discuss the expected domain of both parameters in the following .    *",
    "the parameter @xmath434 is the rayleigh quotient of the matrix @xmath575 on the projection direction @xmath566 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath575 are @xmath576 , both of them nondegenerate , and @xmath577 with @xmath578 degeneracy .",
    "thus , depending on the projection direction @xmath566 , @xmath434 can have both signs . if @xmath566 is taken to have unit norm",
    ", then @xmath434 will be some value in the interval @xmath579 $ ] . *",
    "the 1 + 1 cosmological solution @xmath580 has a characteristic evolution time @xmath581 . on the other hand ,",
    "the longest characteristic evolution time of the oscillator term is @xmath582 , where @xmath266 is the minimum eigenvalue of the frequency matrix @xmath263 .",
    "of course , we are considering a linearly stable equation , so that @xmath307 .",
    "we can consider @xmath49 as slowly - varying if its characteristic time is much greater than the oscillator characteristic time : @xmath583 thus , for times @xmath584 , we may consider @xmath49 as constant , and thus @xmath573 will be a positive number .",
    "equation is integrable .",
    "we can show the form of its trajectories by writing @xmath585 : @xmath586 the last equation has the exact solution @xmath587 in the previous equation , @xmath588 . specializing @xmath589 ( which removes the nonlinear term ) we obtain the oscillator trajectory @xmath590 .",
    "the points where @xmath591 are called _ turning points _ of the trajectory , and they mark its domain because of the square in .",
    "the trajectory has one or two turning points given by the equation @xmath592 if @xmath434 is a fixed positive value , then the previous equation has a single solution if @xmath593 but it has two solutions if @xmath594 . a single turning point describes an open trajectory , while two turning points describe a closed one , see figure [ fig : traj ] .",
    "thus , the oscillator trajectory remains closed when we turn on the non - linearity if @xmath595 therefore , a linearly stable trajectory remains non - linearly stable if the amplitude @xmath596 does not exceed the critical value @xmath597 . beyond this value ,",
    "the trajectory is open and therefore the linearly stable solution becomes non - linearly unstable .",
    "the lowest value of the critical amplitude is reached when @xmath434 is largest ; for a unit - norm projection direction , the largest value of @xmath434 is @xmath11 , as discussed above .",
    "thus , the lowest value of the critical amplitude is @xmath598 as long as amplitudes are smaller than this value , the non - linear derivative couplings can not spoil linear stability . nevertheless ,",
    "when @xmath266 is small , perturbations have a chance of trigger a non - linear instability and destabilize a linearly stable state .",
    "summarizing , the non - linear terms in the multi - radion evolution equations respect the linear stability criterion except in the regime of large amplitudes , which is most easily accessible when the minimum eigenvalue of the frequency matrix becomes small , that is , in the onset of instability .",
