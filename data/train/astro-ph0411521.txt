    "mcgaugh et al .  ( 2000 : mc2000 ) provides a valuable sample of i - band data for 63 optically selected dwarf galaxies .",
    "several of these galaxies are isolated field dwarfs and a few are among the slowest rotators of the known population of disk galaxies . using these galaxies , supplemented by other brighter galaxies",
    ", mc2000 conjected that a log vs.  log baryonic tf relation ( btf ) which includes all the visible baryons ( gas plus stars ) appears to be more nearly linear than the tf relation which includes only the stellar component .",
    "if true , a btf relation relates the baryon content to the dark matter halo s of galaxies , and was probably established at the time of their formation .",
    "gurovich , freeman , and mcgaugh ( in preparation ) have shown that arithmetic errors crept into the mc2000 i - band data .",
    "the i - band magnitudes were systematically over - luminous by @xmath2 ( sign error ) and the hi masses were overestimated by 0.11 dex ( @xmath3 error ) . in order to establish the validity of the btf relation we went back to the original published data and",
    "reanalysed it following the methodology of mc2000 .",
    "the empirical btf relation ( freeman ,  1999 ; mc2000 ) for disk galaxies relates the total baryon mass ( gas + stars ) and @xmath0 , the 20th percentile width of the hi profile . for the brighter galaxies @xmath0 is a fairly direct measure of the amplitude of the flat part of the rotation curve , but for the less massive and more slowly rotating galaxies this is not so clear .",
    "we went to the source of the mcg2000 i - band data for the @xmath4 dwarf galaxies : pildis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , schombert et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and eder & schombert ( 2000 ) , and , from apparent magnitudes kindly made available by james schombert ( private communication ) , we recalculated the stellar and gas baryon masses following the mcg2000 formulation .",
    "for all @xmath4 galaxies we measured the velocity widths @xmath0 based on the spectra of eder & schombert ( 2000 ) and corrected for the inclinations by pildis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the mc2000 data come from an optically selected sample of dwarf galaxies . in this analysis",
    "we have also included 18 hi - selected field dwarf galaxies with inclinations @xmath5 from the hipass survey , which are part of a larger thesis study by gurovich ( 2005 ) . in this paper",
    "we have also included the brighter local calibrator sample ( with cepheid distances ) of sakai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the hi - selected galaxies we collected h - band photometry from the siding spring 2.3 m telescope and obtained @xmath0 and hi masses from narrow - band ( 8mhz , 1024 channels ) observations with the parkes telescope .",
    "all distances were determined using cosmological redshifts , from the hi systemic velocities , calculated for @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , except where reliable secondary distances were available .",
    "the hi data for the sakai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) galaxies were calculated from martin  ( 1998 ) and pilyugin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) but rescaled to the sakai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) distances .",
    "total magnitudes are extrapolated to infinity .",
    "we performed a tf and btf analysis on all four data sets by following mc2000 and adopted @xmath8 , @xmath9 and estimated the gas mass @xmath10 ( from cosmological abundances ) .",
    "we used fitexy in _ numerical recipes _",
    "( press et al .  1992 ) to find weighted bi - variate least - squares linear tf and btf fits .",
    "this algorithm fits the line that minimizes the scatter in both the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 variables , weighting the residuals by the uncertainties in each quantity .",
    "all estimates of baryon masses and @xmath0 have errors arising from uncertainties in the : assumed distances ; @xmath0 measurements ; integrated hi fluxes ( mom0 ) ; inclinations and total extrapolated magnitude measurements .    for the gurovich sample and the corrected mcg2000 i - band data ,",
    "we adopt random peculiar velocities of 180 kms@xmath7  ( 2.4 mpc in distance ) from tonry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , integrated mom0 errors of 20% and total extrapolated magnitude errors of @xmath13mag .",
    "we believe that our distance errors are probably overestimates ( karachentsev et al .",
    "the @xmath0 errors are in the range 5kms@xmath7@xmath14kms@xmath7and 8kms@xmath7@xmath15kms@xmath7  for the two samples , respectively .",
    "the errors for the sakai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) galaxies were taken from that paper and the integrated hi flux errors from the standard deviation of the mean values found in the literature re - scaled to the sakai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) distances .",
    "these errors were propagated following bevington  ( 1969 ) and subsequently used in the weighted bi - variate fits .",
    "the fits are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the slope and @xmath16 can be found in the captions .",
    "these results indicate that for the brighter spiral galaxies ( sakai et al .",
    "2000 ) , the btf fits are tighter than the tf fits and have shallower slopes than the equivalent tf fits .",
    "the tf and btf fits for the fainter galaxies of mcg2000 and of the gurovich thesis sample break from this simple power law model as is evident from the large @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the i - band and @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the h - band data , respectively .",
    "we would like to highlight the fact that careful consideration went into the error analysis and that this result reveals an inadequate model and is not due to an underestimation of the errors .",
    "figure 3 shows the gas mass fraction ( g / s ) for the galaxies in this paper .",
    "as is expected , the fainter galaxies are relatively more gas - rich than the brighter spirals of sakai et al .",
    "it is interesting that the brighter spirals which have smaller ( g / s ) are better modeled by a btf than a tf model .",
    "this is consistent with the conjecture that there is a strict proportionality between the hi and dark baryons : mcg2000 and pfenniger and revaz ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is equally interesting that the fainter disk galaxies that have larger ( g / s ) are not well modelled by a simple btf power law fit .",
    "it could be that this non - linearity arises partly from the assumptions of the constant @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in fact pfenniger and revaz ( 2004 ) conclude that a @xmath24 is a more realistic proportionality .",
    "it is perhaps worth discussing the fainter galaxies in the right panels of figs . 1 and 2 that appear to be exceptionally baryon - rich for their observed @xmath0 .    are these galaxies unusual in having a large baryon mass or a small value of @xmath0 ?",
    "one possible interpretation is that the gas in these galaxies is not quite at the flat part of the rotation curve and hence their @xmath0 values are lower limits of the true rotation amplitude .",
    "however , we note that these galaxies do appear to better follow the ( stellar ) tf relation .",
    "another possibility is that the gas fell into these galaxies after the stellar disk had settled , so that the extra baryons are not part of the original galaxy .",
    "an even more speculative possibility is that a subsample of these systems have dark halos which are significantly less dense than would be expected from the kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) scaling laws for dark halos , and hence have atypically low values of @xmath0 .",
