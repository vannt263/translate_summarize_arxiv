    "the kerr spacetime is one of the most important exact solutions to the einstein vacuum equations .",
    "its relevance stems from the uniqueness theorems for black holes which state that under rather general conditions the kerr spacetime is the only asymptotically flat , stationary , vacuum black hole solution see e.g. the introduction of @xcite for a critical review of the issue of black hole uniqueness and the involved assumptions .",
    "although , the kerr spacetime is very well understood from a spacetime perspective , the same can not be said if one adopts a 3 + 1 point of view which would be the case if one tries to numerically calculate the spacetime from some cauchy initial data .",
    "as soon as one moves away from a 3 + 1 gauge which is adapted to the stationary and axial symmetries which can occur in some applications , in particular in numerical ones an analysis of the kerr spacetime and initial data sets thereof becomes very complicated .",
    "the explicit nature of the kerr solution makes it tempting to perform detailed calculations in order to , say , verify a particular property of the spacetime .",
    "this approach usually leads to very lengthy expressions which can be very hard to analyse .",
    "in a sense one could say that exact solutions contain too much information .",
    "in this case it can be more convenient to adopt more abstract approaches and , accordingly , it may prove useful to have at hand a characterization of kerr initial data .",
    "the question of providing an invariant characterization of initial data sets for the schwarzschild spacetime has been addressed in @xcite . in particular , the analysis of @xcite provides an algorithmic characterization of schwarzschild data .",
    "that is , a procedure is provided to verify whether a given initial data set for the einstein field equations will render a development which is isometric to a portion of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "one of the most important algebraic properties of the kerr spacetime is that its weyl tensor is of petrov type d. the close relation between vacuum spacetimes with a weyl tensor of petrov type d and killing spinors has been exploited in @xcite to provide a characterization of initial data sets whose developments will be of petrov type d. this characterization relies on one being able to decide whether a set of overdetermined partial differential equations has solutions for a given initial data set .",
    "accordingly , such a characterization is not algorithmic .",
    "although not explicitly stated in @xcite , from that analysis it should be possible to obtain a characterization of kerr initial data by adding some global conditions .",
    "the characterization of initial data sets discussed in @xcite has followed the general strategy of starting from a given tensorial ( respectively , spinorial ) _ spacetime _ characterization of the class of spacetimes under consideration .",
    "necessary conditions on the initial data set are obtained by performing a 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime characterization .",
    "given a set of necessary conditions on the initial data , it is then natural to address the question of sufficiency",
    ". this is , usually , the most challenging part of the procedure as one has to discuss the evolution of complicated tensorial objects .",
    "the idea behind this is to show that if the necessary conditions are satisfied on some open subset of the initial hypersurface , then one can possibly , under some additional assumptions recover the spacetime characterization on the development of the open subset on the initial hypersurface from which one started .    in this article a particular characterization of kerr initial data is addressed .",
    "our starting point is a certain spacetime characterization of the kerr spacetime given in @xcite .",
    "this characterization was developed with the aim of providing an alternative way of proving the uniqueness of kerr spacetime among the class of stationary , asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "this expectation has been recently fulfilled in @xcite , where a proof of the uniqueness of kerr which does not make assumptions on the analyticity of the metric has been given . at the heart of the spacetime characterization given in @xcite cfr .",
    "theorem [ kerr - characterization] is a certain tensor , _ the mars - simon tensor _ , whose construction requires the existence of a timelike killing vector .",
    "the mars - simon tensor is a spacetime version of the _ simon tensor _ , a tensor , defined in the quotient manifold of a stationary spacetime , which characterizes the kerr spacetime see @xcite .",
    "following the general strategy for the construction of characterizations of initial data sets out of spacetime characterizations , necessary conditions for kerr initial data are deduced from a 3 + 1 splitting of the mars - simon tensor .",
    "accordingly , one assumes that the spacetime one is working with has a timelike killing vector . this requirement can be encoded in the initial data by requiring that the data has a suitable _ killing initial data _ ( kid ) .",
    "the mars - simon tensor has the same symmetries as the weyl tensor , and hence its 3 + 1 decomposition can be given in terms of its _ electric _ and _ magnetic _ parts . in order to discuss the propagation of the mars - simon tensor we make use of a framework for discussing the propagation tensorial fields using _ superenergy - type _",
    "tensors this framework has been discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the characterization discussed in this article is not algorithmic .",
    "that is , like the one for type d initial data discussed in @xcite it depends on being able to decide whether a certain overdetermined system of partial differential equations admits a solution .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ preliminaries ] our main conventions are fixed and relevant aspects of the 3 + 1 formalism are discussed .",

    "the orthogonal splitting of a tensor expression consists in writing it as a sum of terms which are tensor products of the unit normal and spatial tensors of lesser degree or the same degree in which case the unit normal is absent .    in order to find the orthogonal splitting of expressions containing covariant derivatives we need to introduce",
    "the _ spatial derivative _ @xmath23 which is an operator whose action on any tensor field @xmath24 , @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 from equation ( [ spatialcd ] ) it is clear that @xmath27 is spatial .",
