    "the study of the free energy of a static heavy quark - antiquark pair in a medium of color charges at some temperature @xmath1 has recently become a hot topic of statistical @xmath2 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main reason is the fact that such free energy is related to the potential between quarks and antiquarks , which is of fundamental importance both for understanding deconfinement and in heavy quark phenomenology at finite temperature @xcite . the study of static quark free energies ( polyakov loop correlators ) is also important for constructing effective theories at the deconfinement transition @xcite    the presence of the medium affects the quark - antiquark interaction in a non trivial way .",
    "such modifications of interactions is usually studied in terms of the free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair separated by some distance @xmath3 .",
    "so far most studies concentrated on the behavior of the static quark - antiquark free energy at large distances , @xmath4 @xcite ; below the deconfinement temperature @xmath0 such behavior is characterized by a temperature dependent string tension , above @xmath0 by exponential screening which is governed by a temperature dependent ( debye ) screening mass .",
    "however , it turned out that the free energies of static quark - antiquark exhibit a quite complex temperature behavior already at short distances @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the detailed study of the free energy at short distances allows to define a renormalized order parameter @xcite .",
    "as far as the physics of heavy quarkonia is concerned , the detailed structure of the static quark - antiquark free energy at short distances is even more important than its large distance behavior .",
    "though the large distance behavior of the color averaged potential was extensively studied in refs .",
    "@xcite the problem was not completely settled .",
    "this is partly due to finite size effects and very large statistics needed in such studies .    in this paper",
    "we want to study various features of the heavy quark free energy in @xmath6 gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "the study of @xmath6 lattice gauge theory has at least two advantages : the simulations are not so time consuming as in @xmath7 and the deconfinement transition is second order , which has interesting consequences on the behavior of the free energy near the critical temperature @xmath0 . in general , the heavy quark free energy depends on the color channel one considers ; for a complete analysis we investigated the singlet , the triplet and the color averaged channels",
    ". in particular the study of the color singlet free energy is of interest because it is the most relevant quantity as far as the physics of heavy quarkonia at finite temperature is concerned .",
    "we examined both the short and the long - distance behavior of the free energies , below and above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "we devoted a special attention to the issue of screening , in that we determined the debye masses at various temperatures .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair in color singlet , color triplet and color averaged channels and discuss the choice of the simulation parameters .",
    "the basic features of the static quark - antiquark free energies are also discussed there . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical results below @xmath0 . section iv deals with free energies above deconfinement and determination of the screening masses . in section",
    "v we define the renormalized polyakov loop for su(2 ) gauge theory following ref .",
    "finally section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "on the lattice the free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair in the gluonic medium is determined by correlation functions of temporal wilson lines @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath10 is also referred to as the polyakov loop .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we introduce the color singlet and triplet free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair @xmath11 @xmath12 as well as the color averaged free energy defined by @xmath13 the latter can be written as a thermal average of the free energies in singlet and triplet channels , hence the name , @xmath14 the normalization constant @xmath15 can be defined in different ways . in the deconfined phase it is customary to set @xmath16 .",
    "another possibility is to fix it by normalizing the singlet free energy to the zero temperature heavy quark potential @xcite .",
    "the main problem with the definitions of the singlet and triplet free energies ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) is that these definitions are not gauge invariant , as the wilson line is not a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "the only manifestly gauge invariant quantity is the color averaged free energy .",
    "this is the reason why singlet and triplet free energies were not studied in much detail so far .",
    "it was recently showed by philipsen that gauge invariant definitions of the singlet and triplet free energies can be achieved by replacing the wilson line in eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f3 ] ) by a gauge invariant wilson line defined by @xmath17 the @xmath6 matrix @xmath18 is constructed from eigenvectors of the spatial covariant laplacian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "furthermore it was shown that this definition is equivalent to the definitions of the singlet and triplet free energies in coulomb gauge . since",
    "the determination of eigenvectors of the covariant laplacian is computationally very expensive we fix the coulomb gauge to calculate the singlet and triplet free energies .    in our numerical investigations",
    "we use the standard wilson action . in order to get control over finite size effects , which become important in the vicinity of @xmath0 ,",
    "we have performed simulations at several different volumes . as we also want to investigate the short distance behavior of the free energies simulations",
    "were performed for @xmath19 .",
    "to fix the temperature scale we have used the non - perturbative beta function of ref .",
    "we will also use @xmath20 @xcite , with @xmath21 being the zero temperature string tension .",
    "the lattice volumes and the gauge coupling along with the corresponding temperatures used in our simulations are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".[tab0 ] lattice volumes and gauge couplings @xmath22 used in our simulations .",
    "the values of @xmath23 were obtained using the non - perturbative beta function @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     = 9.cm = 9.cm    calculations of the zero temperature potentials and of the free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair show violation of rotational symmetry at short distances .",
    "since we are also interested in the behavior of the potential at short distances , we should try to remove these lattice artifacts .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we replace @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 in this way we replace the lattice separation by the separation @xmath27 which corrects for the tree level artifacts in the coulomb potential calculated on the lattice .",
    "when presenting the data on the free energy we will always do this replacement unless stated otherwise .",
    "let us now present some general features of our findings .",
    "first we have performed simulations at a fixed lattice spacing , corresponding to the gauge coupling @xmath28 at @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponding to temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) . at this value of the gauge coupling the ground state static quark - antiquark potential as well as the first two excited potentials at @xmath33",
    "have been calculated @xcite and we show them in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with our data .",
    "the singlet free energies at short distances do not differ from the zero temperature potential and temperature dependence shows up only at @xmath34 . on the other hand we find that the triplet free energy is considerably smaller than the first excited potential at @xmath33 . at small distances",
    "it was shown that the excited potential coincides with the perturbative octet ( triplet ) potential up to a non - perturbative constant @xcite .",
    "no such constant is expected in our definition of the triplet free energy which we expect to coincide with the perturbative one at short distances . at very short distances also the triplet free energy is temperature independent .    in most of our calculations",
    "we have varied the temperature @xmath1 by varying the lattice spacing @xmath35 ( i.e. the gauge coupling @xmath22 ) for fixed temporal extent @xmath36 . as both the free energy and the @xmath33 potential contain a lattice spacing dependent additive constant @xmath15 ( c.f .",
    "[ f1]-[av ] ) , some normalization prescription should be introduced in order to compare the free energies calculated at different temperatures .",
    "to do so we assume the following form for the zero temperature potential @xmath37 this form was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting the lattice data on the @xmath33 potential for @xmath38 at @xmath39 apart from the constant which we have omitted .",
    "the violation of rotational invariance on the lattice was taken into account in the fit procedure .",
    "thus equation ( [ vt=0 ] ) defines our convention for the continuum zero temperature potential . in some cases",
    "we need the @xmath33 potential at distances @xmath40 . in this case",
    "we use the 3-loop perturbative potential calculated in @xmath41 scheme @xcite normalized to smoothly match the form defined by eq .",
    "( [ vt=0 ] ) at @xmath42 .",
    "we have also checked that the difference between the 3-loop and 2-loop results is negligible for our purposes . in",
    "what follows the normalization constant @xmath15 will be chosen such ( unless stated otherwise ) that the singlet free energy matches the @xmath33 potential at the shortest distance ( @xmath43 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) we show our results on static free energies calculated for @xmath44 and using this normalization convention .",
    "the free energies in the deconfined phase reach the same value at large distances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected as at very large distances due to screening the free energy of color charges should be independent of their relative color orientation .",
    "what is more interesting is that at large distances the gap between the triplet and singlet free energy vanishes as well in the confinement phase though it is non - zero for the @xmath33 case .",
    "this issue will be discussed more in detail in the next section .",
    "= 9.cm = 9.cm    = 9.cm = 9.cm    in this section we are going to present our numerical results in the confinement phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the singlet and triplet free energies with the normalization described in the previous section .",
    "one can see that the temperature dependence of the singlet free energy is only visible at distances @xmath45 .",
    "the triplet free energy is also temperature independent at small distances ; thermal effects become visible at @xmath46 .",
    "we also notice that there is a slight enhancement of the singlet free energy over the @xmath33 potential in the interval @xmath47 .",
    "a similar enhancement was observed also in the case of @xmath48 dimensional @xmath6 gauge theory at finite temperature @xcite as well as in preliminary @xmath7 calculations @xcite . as the color averaged free energy",
    "is a thermal average of singlet and triplet free energies , it would have a non - trivial temperature dependence even if the latter were temperature independent .",
    "this temperature dependence is larger the smaller the gap between the triplet and singlet contributions . in general",
    "one can say that the temperature dependence of the color averaged free energy at short and intermediate distances is mostly determined by the value and the temperature dependence of the color triplet contribution . if this continues to be true in full qcd , then some of the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite ( where the color averaged free energy was related to the meson masses ) should be revised .    at large distances",
    "the color singlet , triplet and averaged free energy reach a common value which can be parametrized by a form @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ avgstring ] we show the color averaged free energy as well as the string tension obtained from it using the fit to eq .",
    "[ fitbelow ] .",
    "because the deconfinement transition is of second order , the inverse correlation length ( string tension ) vanishes at @xmath0 . as a result",
    "we have large finite size effects close to @xmath0 .",
    "indeed we found that on the @xmath50 lattice the string tension vanishes around @xmath51 .",
    "for this reason we performed simulations on the larger @xmath52 lattice close to @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that the values of @xmath53 we have obtained from our calculations on @xmath54 lattice agree with the results from the @xmath52 lattice up to @xmath55 .",
    "above such temperature we adopt the results from the larger lattice .",
    "the final situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ avgstring ] ( right ) , where the squares indicate the results from @xmath52 , the crosses the ones from @xmath50 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath53 vanishes near @xmath0 according to the power law @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the 3d ising exponent for the correlation length .",
    "therefore we tried to fit our data point by using the ansatz @xmath58 $ ] , with @xmath57 .",
    "the best fit curve is shown in our plot and it reproduces very well our data .",
    "the values of @xmath53 found by us are considerably smaller than those obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the lattice volumes used in ref .",
    "@xcite were considerably smaller than ours .",
    "we start our discussion of the numerical results in the deconfined phase with fig .",
    "[ f1above_ph ] , where we show the singlet free energy in units of @xmath59 normalized to the zero temperature potential at the shortest distance .",
    "as one can see the singlet free energy saturates at large distances , while at short enough distances it is temperature independent and coincides with the zero temperature potential .",
    "the distance in physical units , at which the temperature dependence enters , of course strongly depends on the value of the temperature , the higher the temperature the shorter is the distance where effects of the medium become visible .",
    "also the distance where the singlet free energy saturates strongly depends on the temperature , it is getting larger as we approach @xmath0 .",
    "close to @xmath0 screening enters only at distances @xmath60 .",
    "this feature of the free energy is reflected in the temperature dependence of the screening masses which will be discussed below .",
    "another interesting feature of the singlet free energy is that the value of the plateau of the free energy decreases with the temperature .",
    "such a behavior of the singlet free energy was observed for @xmath7 gauge theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was also argued that the reason for this is the presence of the entropy contribution .    for the further discussion of the results in the deconfined phase , especially for making comparisons with perturbation theory , it is more convenient and in fact customary ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to choose the renormalization constant @xmath15 in eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f3 ] ) to be @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore the large distance behavior of the free energies should be discussed separately from their short distance behavior , where one would expect perturbation theory to work . in general",
    "it is expected that perturbation theory breaks down at distances @xmath62 @xcite , with @xmath63 being the gauge coupling constant . as for the physically interesting temperature range one",
    "always has @xmath64 , perturbation theory may be applicable at distances @xmath65 .",
    "one of the predictions of perturbation theory is that @xmath66 , for any @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ f3suf1 ] we show this ratio for different temperatures .",
    "this ratio appears indeed to be constant for @xmath68 but always smaller than @xmath69 , even for the highest temperature we considered ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "similar results were found in landau gauge in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "high temperature perturbation theory predicts that the color averaged free energy has the form @xcite @xmath71 at distances @xmath72 , with @xmath73 being the leading order debye mass @xmath74 . at distances @xmath75",
    "the simple form ( [ pform ] ) is no longer valid , though the @xmath76-like behavior is still expected due to cancellation between singlet and triplet contributions @xcite .",
    "therefore we define the so - called screening function @xmath77 by the formula @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ scf ] we show the numerical results for the square root screening function .",
    "as one can see from the figure , at high temperatures ( @xmath79 ) the screening function shows a mild @xmath67-dependence , which implies that the color averaged free energy behaves like @xmath76 .",
    "the screening function @xmath77 decreases with with increasing thenperature which one would expect if @xmath80 . at temperatures closer to @xmath0 the screening function decreases at small distances . obviously , this behavior has nothing to do with screening and signals the breakdown of the high temperature expansion .",
    "as we approach @xmath0 @xmath81 is no longer small at small distances as shown in fig . 6 and therefore the exponentials in eq .",
    "( [ av ] ) can not be expanded . as a result of this , the cancellation between the singlet and triplet free energies no longer holds ; moreover , since the singlet free energy is negative and the triplet one is positive ( when working with normalization convention @xmath61 ) the color averaged free energy is dominated by the singlet contribution and behaves like @xmath82 at small distances .",
    "we also note that the free energies calculated for different @xmath36 ( different lattice spacing ) at @xmath83 agree reasonably well .",
    "similar agreement between the results calculated for different values of @xmath36 was observed for other temperatures too .",
    "= 8.2 cm , = 8.2 cm    = 8.2 cm    let us now discuss the large distance behavior of the free energies and the determination of the screening masses .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the discussion of the color singlet and color averaged free energy as the color triplet free energy becomes very noisy at large distances and the present statistics does not allow to study it in detail .",
    "contrary to earlier studies @xcite , where the screening masses were obtained using uncorrelated fit and the short and large distance behaviors of the free energy were not separate , here we use the correlated fit procedure of ref . @xcite . from fig .",
    "6 it is clear that in the region @xmath84 the color averaged free energy can be well described by almost unscreened @xmath76-like behavior .",
    "therefore this region should not be considered for the determination of the screening masses . in our procedure",
    "the fit interval was chosen so that the fit yields a reasonable @xmath85 .",
    "thus , unlike in the uncorrelated fit used in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is no dependence of the screening masses on the fit interval .",
    "we determine the screening mass in the color singlet channel by fitting the data with a screened coulomb ( yukawa - like ) ansatz . in leading order perturbation theory , in fact , the most important contribution to the singlet free energy is given by the exchange of a single gluon . in the case of the color average free energy we used a more general fit ansatz : from the correlator .",
    "as far as we are interested only in the large distance behavior this is equivalent to fitting the free energies . only in the thermodynamic limit the connected correlator vanishes at very large distance",
    ". therefore we allow for a constant @xmath86 in our fit ansatz .",
    "it turns out , however , that this constant is compatible with zero within present statistical accuracy . ] @xmath87 as possible values for the exponent @xmath88 we took @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting values of the screening masses that we extracted are presented in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] for the singlet and the averaged channels , respectively . for determination of the screening masses",
    "we mostly use @xmath54 lattice .",
    "we found that for the color averaged free energy the fits with @xmath90 and @xmath91 are both good for all temperatures , except near @xmath0 , where we got a reasonable @xmath85 only for @xmath90 . from our fit analysis",
    "it then comes out that we can not choose between the two cases , which gives a systematic error of about @xmath92 on the screening masses . in order to eliminate this ambiguity ,",
    "we have also calculated the plane - plane correlator , given by the formula : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "if the color averaged free energy has the form ( [ fitanzatz ] ) with @xmath90 , then @xmath95 should fall off with the distance as a simple exponential , which allows a direct determination of the screening mass .",
    "the results we found are reported for comparison in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we see that the values of the masses extracted from the plane - plane correlator agree in each case with the masses obtained from the point - point correlator when @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the effective masses extracted from @xmath95 .",
    "they reach a plateau already at @xmath96 , which makes the presence of power - like prefactors in @xmath95 at large distances very unlikely and thus implying that very likely @xmath97 . at high temperature dimensional reduction arguments",
    "suggest that @xmath90 , as the large distance behavior of any static correlators is governed by exchange of a bound state of the effective three dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "for @xmath98 the results refer to the @xmath99 lattice instead of @xmath50 . in this case , in fact",
    ", the mass changes appreciably when one goes to the larger @xmath99 lattice .",
    "this is probably due to the large correlation length close to @xmath0 .",
    "further simulations on a @xmath52 lead to the same value of the mass we found on the @xmath99 , which is then reliable as infinite volume limit at this temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ mass ] we show the screening masses extracted from the singlet free energy as a function of the temperature . there",
    "we also show the values of the screening masses obtained from the electric gluon propagator in landau gauge @xcite at @xmath100 . as one",
    "can see they are compatible with the singlet masses we have found .",
    "this is to be expected in perturbation theory . but as @xmath64 in the temperature interval considered and the screening mass governs the large distance behavior of the free energy , this agreement is quite non - trivial . in fig .",
    "[ mass ] the color averaged screening masses are shown as well ; we compared them with the lowest @xmath101 scalar screening mass ( spatial glueball mass ) obtained in ref .",
    "dimensional reduction arguments @xcite suggest that these masses should agree at high temperature and the figure seems to indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "very recently the plane - plane correlators of polyakov loops were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( we use the non - perturbative beta function @xcite to convert the gauge coupling of ref . @xcite to temperature ) . in fig .",
    "[ mass ] we show as well the corresponding screening masses ( open triangles ) .",
    "moreover we note that the color averaged screening masses obtained by us using fits with @xmath91 agree with findings of refs . @xcite where the same exponent was used .",
    "the color averaged screening mass should go to zero when @xmath104 because it is just the inverse of the polyakov loop correlation length , which diverges at @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand there is no a priori argument for which the singlet mass should vanish at the threshold .",
    "[ mass ] indicates that both masses become very small near @xmath0 .",
    "the last issue we would like to address is the renormalization of the polyakov loop .",
    "it is known that if one takes the continuum limit at fixed temperature , the expectation value of the polyakov loop vanishes , so that the usual definition does not really provide a physical order parameter for deconfinement . as we have already said at the beginning ,",
    "the free energies on the lattice are always defined up to some renormalization constant . according to a recent work @xcite , a suitable choice of such renormalization constant can lead to a new definition of the polyakov loop .",
    "if the constant is chosen such that the singlet free energy matches the zero temperature heavy quark potential at short distances , one can define a `` renormalized '' polyakov loop @xmath105 through the formula : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the asymptotic value of the singlet free energy at the temperature @xmath1 ( in fact , it does not depend on relative color orientation of the quark - antiquark pair , see above ) .",
    "we remind that we have renormalized the singlet free energy exactly in this way , so that , in our case , @xmath107 is nothing but the height of the plateau of the curves in fig .",
    "practically we took @xmath108 , which is the value of the free energy at the largest distance allowed on the lattice . in fig .",
    "[ lrenorm ] we plot the renormalized polyakov loop as function of the temperatures . when normalizing the singlet free energy to the @xmath33 potential at the shortest distance ( @xmath43 ) we implicitly assume that there is no temperature dependence at this distance",
    ". this may not always be the case .",
    "therefore we also calculate @xmath109 and the corresponding @xmath105 by normalizing the singlet free energy to the @xmath33 potential as well at @xmath110 .",
    "the difference in @xmath109 ( @xmath105 ) arising from these two normalizations give us an estimate of possible systematic errors .",
    "when quoting the error on the renormalized polyakov loop we always add quadratically the systematic and the statistical errors . at variance with @xmath7",
    ", we now have a second order phase transition and a well defined scaling behavior of @xmath105 at criticality .",
    "in order to check the scaling we have fitted the data on @xmath105 using the standard ansatz in the interval @xmath111    @xmath112,\\ ] ]    with the exponents @xmath113 and @xmath114 fixed to their @xmath6 values @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the fit curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ lrenorm ] ( dashed line ) and reproduces quite well the pattern of the data points . considering only temperatures @xmath117 it is possible to fit the data with @xmath118 and approximately same value of @xmath119 .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the quark - antiquark free energies in @xmath6 gauge theory below and above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "we have found that the temperature dependence of the singlet free energy is much weaker than the temperature dependence of the color averaged free energy .",
    "most of the temperature dependence of the color averaged free energy is due to the presence of the color triplet contribution and its temperature dependence . if this will hold for real qcd it may have important consequences in the heavy quarkonia phenomenology at finite temperature . at large distances",
    "the free energy in color singlet and triplet channel converge to a common value .    above @xmath0 the color singlet",
    "free energy can be understood in terms of propagation of a non - perturbatively screened gluon . through the detailed analysis of the point - point and plane - plane correlators as well as",
    "comparisons with other determinations of the screening masses we have established that the color averaged free energy is described by yukawa law at large distances whereas at shorter distances it exhibits a more complex behavior . at low temperatures and short distances the color averaged free energy is dominated by the singlet contribution , while at higher temperatures it has @xmath120 behavior and its temperature dependence is qualitatively the same as predicted by perturbation theory .",
    "finally we have shown that the renormalized polyakov loop defined in @xcite has the correct scaling behavior near the critical temperature .",
    "as an outlook we note that we have studied the free energy of static charges in fundamental representation . it will be interesting to investigate the free energy of static charges in other representations .",

    "<S> we study the properties of the free energy of infinitely heavy quark anti - quark pair in su(2 ) gauge theory . by means of lattice monte carlo simulations we calculated the free energies in the singlet , triplet and color averaged channels , both in the confinement and in the deconfinement phase . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet and triplet free energies are defined in coulomb gauge which is equivalent to their gauge invariant definitions recently introduced by philipsen . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the short and the long distance behavior , making comparisons with the zero temperature case . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the electric screening mass is carefully investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the order of the deconfining transition is manifest in the results near @xmath0 and it allows a reliable test of a recently proposed method to renormalize the polyakov loop .        0.7 cm </S>"
