    "following the recent introduction of d - wave quantum annealing processors , a wealth of research has aimed to characterize the performance of this new platform , in particular pitting it against classical competition @xcite .",
    "d - wave processors take as input spin glass instances in the ising model , and it is straightforward to express a variety of np - hard problems in this format @xcite . however , the energy landscape of some instances may be more amenable to solution by thermal or combinatorial methods than quantum methods @xcite , and input to current d - wave processors must be reasonably robust to analog control error if we are to observe the mechanics of the underlying quantum annealing platform rather than classical noise @xcite .",
    "the selection of appropriate testbeds to use when probing for quantum speedup has recently been the subject of much research .",
    "this research has identified several desirable properties of input sets , including the existence of a nonzero - temperature spin glass phase transition @xcite , foreknowledge of the ground state energy and possibly ground states @xcite , tunable difficulty , and robustness to analog control error and thermal effects @xcite",
    ".    randomly generated instances of constraint satisfaction problems ( csps ) or _ satisfiability _ problems are an attractive target : they are well - understood from a statistical physics perspective , and their difficulty can be tuned by a single parameter : the constraint - to - variable ratio @xmath0 @xcite . however , direct solution of these instances requires , in general , the ability to couple arbitrary pairs of qubits in the processor . while this can be done indirectly in a d - wave processor through creation of logical qubits @xcite , this may amplify control error and obscure the underlying mechanics of the processor @xcite .",
    "hen @xcite managed this issue by constructing constraint satisfaction problems that can be directly embedded in an arbitrary qubit connectivity graph ; each constraint is a _ frustrated loop _ , i.e.  a cycle of couplers of which an odd number are antiferromagnetic .",
    "these problems have two desirable properties : a _ planted _ ( foreknown ) ground state and difficulty that can be tuned with the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "hen et al .",
    "@xcite show that performance scaling for the d - wave processor is superior to the best of a suite of classical solvers in one region of @xmath0 , but is worse in the region of @xmath0 encompassing the hardest instances .",
    "however , their instances are constructed in such a way that for a fixed value of @xmath0 , thermal effects and analog error are increasingly amplified by normalization as the problems increase in size .    here",
    "we present a simple modification of the construction of these instances that curtails this effect , putting the analog and digital solvers on more level ground and reducing unwanted thermal behavior . on these _ range - limited _ instances , we find that a d - wave vesuvius processor shows better performance scaling than classical competition for all values of @xmath0 tested .",
    "this competition consists of the two best - performing classical software solvers studied by hen et al . :",
    "the zero - temperature _ hamze - de  freitas - selby _ ( hfs ) algorithm @xcite , and a solver version of simulated annealing ( sas ) @xcite .",
    ".  also showed very strong correlation between success probabilities in the d - wave processor and a thermal gibbs state approximated using standard simulated annealing ( saa ) @xcite . moderating the coupling range of the input instances , and therefore the temperature relative to the final gap of the time - dependent hamiltonian , reduces correlation with the thermal model .",
    "quantum annealing in the ising model aims to find low - energy states in a system of @xmath1 interacting spins via evolution of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the run time of the qa algorithm , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the time - independent ising problem hamiltonian : @xmath8 we refer to the ising hamiltonian as @xmath9 , where the biases @xmath10 and pairwise couplings @xmath11 encode the optimization problem ( i.e.  energy function ) we wish to solve ( i.e.  minimize ) .    in a d - wave quantum annealing processor @xcite ,",
    "not all pairs of qubits are coupled , and therefore the set of nonzero entries of @xmath11 must adhere to the physical constraints of the processor .",
    "one can view @xmath12 as a set of vertex and edge weights , respectively , of the _ qubit connectivity graph _ , whose vertices correspond to qubits and whose edges correspond to couplers .",
    "for a particular hardware qubit connectivity graph @xmath13 with @xmath1 vertices ( qubits ) , and a particular constraint - to - qubit ratio @xmath0 , hen et al .  construct a _ frustrated loop _ instance using @xmath14 loops like so :    1 .",
    "for @xmath15 , loop @xmath16 is a cycle in @xmath13 chosen as the first cycle generated by the edges of a random walk in @xmath13 starting at a random vertex .",
    "if @xmath16 contains fewer than 8 vertices , it is discarded and generated anew .",
    "2 .   the constraint ising hamiltonian @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath16 has value @xmath18 on every edge of @xmath16 except for a randomly selected edge @xmath19 of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 has value @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath17 is zero elsewhere .",
    "the final ising hamiltonian is @xmath12 , where @xmath10 is the zero vector and @xmath21 .",
    "any instance constructed with this method has integer - valued @xmath10 and @xmath11 , but the _ coupling range _",
    "@xmath22 , i.e.  the maximum magnitude of any entry in @xmath11 , is not necessarily bounded .",
    "moreover , typical instances constructed at a fixed ratio @xmath0 on increasingly large subgrids of the d - wave processor have increasing range limits @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since input @xmath12 to the d - wave processor must be normalized to within the range @xmath24 $ ] , coupling range @xmath23 necessitates scaling by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "this scale factor creates two complications when studying the efficacy of the quantum annealing algorithm on practical hardware .",
    "first , the operating temperature of the processor relative to the magnitude of the input increases with @xmath23 , thus increasing undesirable thermal effects .",
    "second , each coupler and local field is subject to analog control error on the order of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the errors @xmath28 and @xmath29 are relative to normalized full energy scale @xmath30 .",
    "note that errors are present even for @xmath31 or @xmath32 . for scale factors of @xmath23 , analog control error relative to the magnitude of the desired input",
    "is increased by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the deviation of the actual input from the desired input increases with increasing @xmath23 . in the range - unlimited instances studied by hen et al .",
    "this amplification factor is as high as 17 , and can be dictated by a single coupler that happens to be in disproportionately many loops . since @xmath23 grows with instance size @xmath1 , the d - wave processor is penalized on larger instances .    in order to address this issue",
    ", we construct each instance with respect to an integer coupling range @xmath33 , so that in our instances each entry of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is an integer between @xmath34 and @xmath23 . to do this , when selecting a candidate for @xmath16 via random walk we ignore edges of @xmath13 on which @xmath35 is already @xmath23 .",
    "this ensures that the final hamiltonian @xmath12 has all entries in the range @xmath36 $ ] , so when the instance is necessarily normalized to the range @xmath24 $ ] as input to the d - wave processor , it is scaled down by no more than a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , analog control errors and thermal effects in our instances are relatively amplified by no more than a factor of @xmath23 where @xmath23 is independent of instance size @xmath1 .",
    "there is another , less crucial modification of the construction : while hen et al .",
    "reject and resample a choice of @xmath16 if it is too short , we reject the choice if it is contained in a single eight - qubit _ unit cell _ @xcite .",
    "thus we sometimes allow loops of length 6 , and sometimes forbid loops of length 8 .",
    "this modification should in principle allow for greater frustration and less domain clustering within unit cells .    in any meaningful study of analog quantum annealing processors",
    "it is desirable to limit relative amplification of analog control error and unwanted thermal effects if it can be done without otherwise materially detracting from the experiment . in this work",
    "we consider @xmath37 and @xmath38 $ ] ; these values of @xmath0 include the hardest regime",
    ". implications of our choice of coupling range and loop selection criteria are considered in greater detail in the supplemental material @xcite .",
    "all of these frustrated loop instances will , by construction , have @xmath39 and @xmath40 as planted ground states .",
    "hen et al .",
    "describe these instances as being constructed with respect to an arbitrary antipodal pair of planted solutions , but our construction is equivalent under change of variables ( ising spin reversal ) both in theory and , due to the application of random spin reversals in hardware , in practice .",
    "we compare performance of a d - wave quantum annealing processor to hfs and sas , both described by hen et al .",
    "our instances are constructed on subgraphs of a _ chimera graph _",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath1 of @xmath42 qubits are functional , for @xmath43 ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . following their methodology , we run sas on a linear schedule of optimal length in inverse temperature spanning the range @xmath44 $ ] after scaling the input to the range @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "scaling of the hamiltonian has no bearing on hfs , which is a large - neighborhood zero - temperature search that exploits low - treewidth induced subgraphs in the chimera architecture .    in order to remain consistent with previous probes for quantum speedup @xcite",
    ", we assume that classical algorithms are run by a perfectly parallel oracle that allows all @xmath1 sites to be updated simultaneously in simulated annealing , and allows all possible cell updates in hfs to be performed in parallel .",
    "going even further , we simply divide sas running time by @xmath1 and divide hfs running time by @xmath45 , the maximum possible number of parallel cell updates at any point in the algorithm . further detail on experimental methods , benchmarking and data analysis is given in the supplemental material @xcite . to account for differences between implementations and hardware",
    ", we use the assumption of hen et al .  that each monte carlo sweep takes time @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that each hfs unit cell update takes @xmath47 .",
    "the d - wave processor used was a d - wave two v6 processor of the same architecture and fabrication lot as the processor used by hen et al .",
    "@xcite      in fig .",
    "[ fig : tts ] we show the scaling of the median time to solution for the three solvers as the problem size @xmath48 increases . as in previous work @xcite",
    ", we are particularly interested in how the ratio between two solvers time to solution scales with respect to problem size .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : speedup ] .",
    "a positive slope in fig .  [ fig : speedup ] indicates a performance scaling advantage for the d - wave processor , and the possibility of _ limited quantum speedup _ as defined by rnnow et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of sas , and the possibility of _ potential quantum speedup _ in the case of hfs . in the supplemental material @xcite",
    "we arrange the data for range-2 , range-3 , and range - unlimited instances by @xmath0 .",
    "d - wave vesuvius processors allow a minimum anneal time of @xmath49 ; previous work has shown that @xmath50-scale problems with optimal anneal time greater than this are elusive @xcite .",
    "proving limited quantum speedup in this framework would require data from the d - wave processor using shorter anneals to certify that we are not artificially slowing the processor on easier instances .",
    "in particular for the smaller and easier problems , the minimum anneal time may mask the true performance scaling of the quantum annealing platform @xcite .",
    "this may explain , to some extent , the outstanding performance of the d - wave processor on high-@xmath0 instances .    in the supplemental material @xcite we analyze the effect that range limitation has on the difficulty of the problems .",
    "here we simply note that for the hardest range of @xmath0 , limiting the range of instances to 3 does not seem to make the problems significantly easier .",
    "this can be seen where range-2 , range-3 , and range - unlimited instances are compared for the available solvers .",
    "hen et al .  found strong correlation between the success probabilities of a d - wave processor and a nearly equilibrated thermal annealer with a final inverse temperature of @xmath51 .",
    "our results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scaling ] and supplemental material @xcite ) show poorer correlation and an inability to fit d - wave scaling data to saa at a single inverse temperature . unlike the range - unlimited instances studied in @xcite , the hardness peak for saa does not remain constant with varying @xmath52 . in the supplemental material",
    "we show instancewise scatter plots of d - wave and saa success probabilities .",
    "the predictions of the thermal model do not correlate well with the hardware on the range 2 and range 3 instances .",
    "far from being artificial , fixed coupling range in the large system limit appears , at the phase transition in the ising formulation of not - all - equal 3-sat @xcite variables , whereas in a frustrated loop instance with @xmath53 on a chimera graph the expected number of constraints containing a given coupler is close to 1 .",
    "] , which is np - hard and can be formulated as a frustrated loop problem on the complete graph .",
    "furthermore , limiting coupling range in hard frustrated loop instances affects a vanishingly small portion of each instance ( see supplemental material @xcite ) .",
    "the study of instances with fixed coupling range allows for the control of two factors : amplification of analog control error ( for d - wave ) and effective operating temperature ( for d - wave , sas , saa , and any other simulated physical model with a thermal component @xcite ) .",
    "our results , taken in conjunction with those from ref .",
    "@xcite , indicate a decreasing advantage for the d - wave hardware relative to sas with increasing range .",
    "this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that increasing range penalizes the hardware by augmenting both the relative magnitude of control errors and the importance of thermalization .",
    "it is straightforward to construct input classes for which analog control error will dominate the performance scaling of an analog processor . when probing the potential for quantum speedup in a quantum annealing platform , it is important to do the opposite : construct an input class for which the impact of analog control error is minimal . in doing",
    "so we might better observe properties of the annealer s mechanics rather than observing the effect of precision limitations , which by now are reasonably well understood @xcite and expected to improve with the maturation of the technology and the possible implementation of error correction strategies @xcite .",
