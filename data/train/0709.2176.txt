    "photosynthesis is a reaction in which light energy is converted into chemical energy .",
    "the primary process of photosynthesis is carried out by a pigment - protein complex embedded in the membrane , that is , rc . in photosynthetic purple bacteria ,",
    "the cyclic electron transfer reaction is performed by rc and two other components : the cytochrome ( cyt ) @xmath0 complex , and the soluble electron carrier protein .",
    "the photosynthetic reaction centers ( rc ) is a special pigment - protein complex , that functions as a photochemical trap .",
    "the precise details of the charge separations reactions and subsequent dark electron transport ( et ) form the central question of the conversion of solar energy into the usable chemical energy of photosynthetic organism .",
    "the function of the reaction center is to convert solar energy into biochemical amenable energy .",
    "therefore , we wish to understand which features of the reaction center are responsible for the rate constants of these reactions .",
    "insight into the molecular organization of the rc has been derived , initially , from spectroscopic studies and , subsequently , from the development and analysis of high - resolution crystal structures of several photosynthetic organisms .",
    "the first rc structurally resolved ( 3 ) was of the purple bacterial rc from _ rhodopseudomonas viridis _",
    "this was soon followed by the elucidation of several other purple bacterial structures .",
    "good progress is also being made toward achieving two- and three - dimensional structures of photosystem ii ( psii ) crystals .",
    "it is surprising that the structures of all of the different rc s show a dimeric core with a pseudo-@xmath1 axis of symmetry .",
    "a remarkable aspect of the rc structures is the occurrence of two almost identical electron acceptor pathways arranged along the @xmath1 axis relative to the primary charge - separating dimer ( bacterio ) chlorophyll ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this finding posed a key question : does electron transfer involve both branches ? in the purple bacterial rc , only one branch is active although the inactive branch can be forced into operation with modification of amino acid side chains on the active branch  @xcite . moreover",
    "the charge - separating electron transfer reactions occur with a remarkably high quantum yield of @xmath2% , where from two possible symmetric branches only the branch @xmath3 is active in the electron transfer .",
    "this efficiency relies on the rates of the charge - separating reactions being 2 - 3 orders of magnitude faster than the rates of the competing reactions .",
    "the strong asymmetry imposed on primary charge separation photo - chemistry in the purple bacterial rc results from two homologous polypeptides that function as a heterodimer .",
    "a heterodimer is also involved in the core of the rc s of psi and psii .",
    "however , some rc s , such as heliobacteria  @xcite and green sulfur bacteria  @xcite , contain two identical homodimeric polypeptides , and electron transfer is potentially bifurcated .    genetic sequence information has greatly improved the understanding of the origin of the rc proteins . from the sequence analysis , it became clear that the purple bacteria rc is remarkably similar to that of psii , and psi was also discovered to have similarity with that of the green sulfur bacteria  @xcite .",
    "recent structural comparisons between psi and psii , for example , show a distinct structural homology , which suggests that even these two rc s likely share a common ancestor  @xcite .    in purple bacteria ,",
    "the electron rate is sensitive to the free energy difference between the excited state and the charge - separated state but not to the relative distribution of electrons over the two macrocycles of the donor .",
    "after extensive studies , the rate is now established to be critically coupled to the properties of the bacteriochlorophyll monomer that lies between the donor and bacteriopheophytin acceptor ( fig.1 ) . the involvement of the bacteriochlorophyll monomer may give rise to multiple pathways for electron transfer  @xcite and can partially determine the asymmetry of the electron transfer along one branch  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the reason for asymmetric et between prosthetic groups located on different polypeptides is a different molecular dynamics .",
    "dynamics of atoms causes the change of the electrical potential fields and the conformational variations influence the mutual orientations between cofactors .",
    "then the energy gap and overlap of electronic wave functions fluctuates as a result in the system .",
    "the net result is a different fluctuation of electronic energy levels on prosthetic groups and also a different fluctuations of the overlaps of the electronic wave functions on @xmath3 and @xmath4 branches . on the other hand",
    "the chain located on subunit @xmath4 is inactive in et and the highly asymmetric functionality , however , can be decreased by amino acid mutations or cofactor modification .",
    "we used this approach to explain the effect of individual amino acid mutation or cofactor modifications on the observed balance between the forward et reaction on the @xmath3-side of the rc , the charge recombination processes , and et to the @xmath4-side chromophores  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models that describe the charge transfer in reaction centers using parameters with clear physical interpretations . some of these input parameters can not be deduced from independent experimental work .",
    "the information regarding the energetic parameters , the medium reorganization energies , the high frequency modes , and electronic coupling terms can be achieve with quantum mechanical computations .",
    "but until now these parameters which characterize the reaction centers are not available .",
    "and so we use the set of parameters which fit the experiments .",
    "several sets of parameters were used to describe a charge transfer in the rc .",
    "a set of parameters based on molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite corresponds to a dominance of superexchange mechanisms for the primary et reaction in rc s .",
    "another set of parameters  @xcite was used to fit experimental data .",
    "this second set of parameters derives a dominant contribution from the sequential mechanism .",
    "the first set of parameters has the larger reorganization energies and the greater coupling factors .",
    "this set of parameters makes the et rate much larger than it is found in the wild - type proteins . the possibility to find out the input parameters from theory is comparison of observed kinetics for different mutated reaction centers .",
    "the problem is that not always the impact of mutation on the input parameters is clear . in this paper",
    "we focus on the electron transfer in two rcs .",
    "first is the rcs of the green bacterium _",
    "chloroflexus aurantiacus_. the second is the rcs of _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _ _ h(m182)l _ mutation .",
    "it is believe that both purple bacterial rcs and rcs from _ c. aurantiacus _ have a similar structure  @xcite .",
    "we adapt in this work the set of parameters that characterized the observed l - side experimental kinetics of wild - type ( wt ) rcs of rb.sphaeroides very well .",
    "the _ chloroflexus aurantiacus _",
    "rc s and the rcs of _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _",
    "_ h(m182)l _ mutation have structural similarity but charge separation kinetics are different .",
    "both these rcs contain bpheo pigment in m - branch in the position where bchl monomer is placed in the wt reaction center .",
    "in contrast with this structural similarity , the h(m182)l mutant reveal the electron transfer through the m branch , in the _ chloroflexus aurantiacus _",
    "rc s the m - branch is inactive .",
    "we attempt to analyze the possibility that et asymmetry can be described by model which assumes that there exists the vibrational modes of the medium which has a sufficient time for relax to the thermal equilibrium after each et step .",
