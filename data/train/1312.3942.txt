    "the schrdinger equation and the klein gordon equation are two important equations of quantum physics .",
    "therefore it is important that we determine their lie point symmetries and use them either in order to find invariant solutions  using lie symmetry methods @xcite or to obtain first integrals which will ease the search for analytic solutions .",
    "nowadays the determination of lie symmetries of des can be done mechanically by symbolic computer programs , for instance crack , mathlie , dimsym , sade and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however this option is prohibited when one works in riemannian spaces and in higher dimensions .",
    "therefore it is important that one finds geometric arguments which provide the lie symmetries of des in general riemannian spaces irrespectively of the ( finite ) dimension f the space .",

    "an important element of the present study is the concept of conformally related lagrangians , that is lagrangians which under a conformal transformation of the metric and the potential lead to the same equations but for different dynamic variables .",

    "as it will be shown the conformal symmetries of this metric are in close relation with the noether point symmetries of the equations of motion .",
    "furthermore the kinetic metric of the lagrangian defines the laplace operator , hence the corresponding klein gordon equation whose lie symmetries are consequently expressed in terms of the conformal symmetries of the kinematic metric .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .  in section [ col1 ]",

    "in section [ symmetries of the lagrangian with non constant gauge function ] we consider the case of noether point symmetries of the classical lagrangian which are generated from a gradient killing vector ( kv ) or a gradient homothetic vector ( hv ) and show that the lie symmetry in both cases is a non - local symmetry of the klein gordon equation .    in sections [ classification ] and [ staticss ] ,",
    "we demonstrate the use of the previous general results to various interesting practical situations .",

    "more precisely for the schrdinger equation it has been shown that if a kv / hv of the metric @xmath4 produces a lie point symmetry for the schrdinger equation then produces a noether point symmetry for the classical lagrangian in the space with metric @xmath4 and potential @xmath39 .",
