    "internal kinematics of galaxies provide important clues about their nature and reveal physically distinct components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while stars are on colissionless orbits tracing the gravitational potential dominated by dark matter , gas clouds can react faster on subtle effects and may display peculiar motions revealing interaction events . in case of undisturbed",
    "spiral galaxies rotation produces a characteristic velocity profile with a steep rise in the inner part turning over to a flat part , the so - called rotation curve rc .",
    "in such a virialized state , the maximum velocity  provides a good estimate of the total mass of a galaxy and tightly correlates with the luminosity in the tully  fisher relation tfr . under this assumption",
    "the tfr is an important scaling relation to probe quantitatively the evolution of disk galaxies with redshift as applied in several studies before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since stellar kinematics from absorption lines requires a higher @xmath3 most studies of distant galaxies rely on emission line measurements from the warm ionized gas .",
    "here , we report on two applications : a tfr study of distant field galaxies and an investigation of transition objects in the cluster complex abell901/2 .",
    "continuing our previous investigations we expanded our sample towards fainter galaxies with new observations with eso s vlt using fors @xcite .",
    "the whole sample holds high - quality spectra of 238 objects . for 137 disk galaxies we were able to extract rcs and",
    "determine , while 101 emission - line objects were rejected from our tf analysis due to kinematic distortions .",
    "these field spirals are spread like @xmath5 with a median redshift of 0.45 corresponding to lookback times between 0.6 and 7.6gyr and @xmath6gyr . in fig.[figtf ] we show their tfr in rest - frame @xmath1-band compared to the local study of @xcite .",
    "the slope of the distant sample is with @xmath7 similar to the local value of @xmath8 .",
    "we further create a subsample of 48 objects restricted to have both high - quality rcs and a low structural asymmetry ( @xmath9 in the cas system of @xcite ) to ensure regularity in both the gas and the stellar component in order to avoid any non - relaxed contribution to the velocity field . assuming the local slope this subsample shows moderate brightening of on average @xmath10 and a scatter of @xmath11 , which is two times larger than the local one .",
    "this may be attributed to a modest diversity of star formation histories and chemical enrichments of the observed galaxies @xcite .",
    "looking at the evolution of the tf residuals from the local relation we fit our whole sample linearly with lookback time and find @xmath12 albeit with large scatter .",
    "such an increase in luminosity is derived by other studies , too ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in accordance with model predictions @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the velocity  size evolution of the same galaxies by measuring their disk scale lengths @xmath13 in hst @xmath14-band images .",
    "although the scatter is rather large , our sample is offset by @xmath150.15dex to smaller @xmath13 for given  compared to the local sample of @xcite , see fig.[figvsr ] .",
    "note that the local sample was observed in @xmath14-band , too , and the scale lengths of the distant galaxies were slightly corrected for rest - frame wavelength shift following @xcite . on average ,",
    "disk sizes decrease by @xmath16 becoming about 60% smaller at @xmath0 , which is again in accordance with models .",
    "looking for environmental effects we examine galaxies in the multiple cluster system abell901/902 at @xmath2 @xcite . an observational program with eso s vlt using vimos targeted @xmath17200 emission - line galaxies in the cluster complex with tilted slits placed along the major axis ( pi a.  bhm , see @xcite ) .",
    "a kinematic analysis was possible for 96 cluster members and 86 field spirals with a similar average redshift ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , many objects do nt exhibit a regular rc but distorted kinematics . to quantify the degree of distortion we introduce similar to @xcite an rc asymmetry index @xmath19 based on differences of the approaching and receding arms .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath20 in the field , while distortions are more frequent in the cluster , yielding @xmath21 .",
    "restricting to objects with high - quality rcs for a tf analysis we find that cluster members are on average modestly fainter in rest - frame @xmath1-band by @xmath22 . however , there is no significant difference in the stellar tf with @xmath23 .",
    "further , we concentrate on red spirals that were defined by @xcite to have red colors similar to red - sequence galaxies but ( spiral ) disk morphology and significant star formation rates ( sfrs ) , albeit lower than typical for blue spirals .",
    "those red spirals with regular rcs are on average fainter in the @xmath1-band tfr by @xmath24 and show a slight difference in the stellar tf by @xmath25 compared to blue - cloud cluster members @xcite",
    ". these results may be explained by a recent quenching of sf for red spirals caused by ram - pressure stripping in the cluster removing gas .",
    "this interpretation is strengthened by fig.[amarc ] : many red spirals show strong rotation curve asymmetries combined with an undisturbed stellar morphology . the only cluster - specific interaction process which affects the gas disk but",
    "not the stellar morphology is ram - pressure @xcite .",
    "thus , our analysis adds evidence that red spirals are transition objects between field blue - cloud and cluster lenticular galaxies .",
