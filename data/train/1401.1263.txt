    "the eigenvalues of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are referred to as the laplacian and normalized laplacian eigenvalues of graph @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "details of the theory of graph eigenvalues can be found in @xcite .",
    "the estrada index of a graph @xmath0 is defined in @xcite as @xmath21 which was first introduced in 2000 as a molecular structure - descriptor by ernesto estrada @xcite .",
    "the laplacian estrada index of a graph @xmath0 is defined in @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of edges in @xmath0 .",
    "another essentially equivalent definition for the laplacian estrada index is given by @xmath24 in @xcite independently .",
    "albeit young , the ( laplacian ) estrada index has already found a variety of chemical applications in the degree of folding of long - chain polymeric molecules @xcite , extended atomic branching @xcite , and the shannon entropy descriptor @xcite .",
    "in addition , noteworthy applications in complex networks are uncovered @xcite .",
    "mathematical properties of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , especially the upper and lower bounds , are investigated in e.g. @xcite .    very recently , in full analogy with the ( laplacian )",
    "estrada index , the normalized laplacian estrada index of a graph @xmath0 is introduced in @xcite as @xmath27 among other things , the following tight bounds for @xmath4 are obtained .    * theorem 1 . *",

    ". then @xmath32 the equality occurs in both bounds if and only if @xmath0 is a complete bipartite regular graph .",
    "_    in this paper , we find a tight lower bound for @xmath4 of a general graph ( not necessarily connected ) by extending theorem 1 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath4 for a class of treelike fractals , which subsume some important chemical trees as special cases , through an explicit recursive relation .",
    "we unveil that @xmath4 scales linearly with the order of the fractal , i.e. , @xmath33 for large @xmath1 , in line with the lower bound in theorem 2 .",
    "we begin with some basic properties of the normalized laplacian eigenvalues of a connected graph @xmath0 . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "to ease notation , we shall use @xmath34 , @xmath14 to represent the normalized laplacian eigenvalues of a graph of order @xmath1 .",

    "_    clearly , we reproduce theorem 1 when @xmath47 ( and @xmath48 ) .    * proof . * from lemma 1 and the fact that the normalized laplacian eigenvalue for an isolated vertex is zero , we obtain @xmath49 and @xmath50 . hence , @xmath51 where the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality is utilized .",
    "now suppose @xmath52 for some integers @xmath53 and @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath54 , and the normalized laplacian eigenvalues of @xmath0 can be computed as 0 with multiplicity @xmath42 and @xmath55 with multiplicity @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , @xmath57    conversely , suppose that the equality holds in ( [ 4 ] )",
    ". then from the above application of the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality we know that all the non - zero normalized laplacian eigenvalues of @xmath0 must be mutually equal .",
    "suppose that a connected graph @xmath58 with order @xmath59 has normalized laplacian eigenvalues @xmath60 with multiplicity @xmath61 and a single zero eigenvalues .",
    "it now suffices to show @xmath62 .",
    "the case of @xmath63 holds trivially . in what follows ,",
    "we assume @xmath46 .",
    "we first claim that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the identity matrix and @xmath66 is the zero matrix . indeed , for any vector @xmath67",
    ", we can decompose it as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a column vector with all elements being 1 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are eigenvectors associated with @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the equation ( [ 5 ] ) follows by the fact that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .    in the light of (",
    "[ 5 ] ) , all columns of @xmath76 belong to the null space of @xmath77",
    ". it follows from lemma 1 that the null space of @xmath77 is of dimension one and is spanned by @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , each column of @xmath79 is of the form @xmath80 for some @xmath81 . since @xmath58 is connected , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that any pair of vertices in @xmath58 must be adjacent in view of the definition of @xmath77 .",
    "this means @xmath62 . @xmath85",
    "in this section , we analytically calculate @xmath4 for a class of treelike fractals through a recursive relation deduced from the self - similar structure of the fractals .",
    "it is of great interest to seek @xmath4 ( also @xmath26 and @xmath25 ) for specific graphs due to the following two reasons : firstly , a universal approach for evaluating these structure descriptors of general graphs , especially large - scale graphs , is out of reach so far ; and secondly , the known upper and lower bounds ( such as ( [ 3 ] ) ) are too far away apart to offer any meaningful guide for a given graph .",
    "the fractal graphs in question are constructed in an iterative manner @xcite . for integers @xmath86 and @xmath87 , let @xmath88 represent the graph after @xmath89 iterations ( generations ) . when @xmath90 , @xmath91 is an edge linking two vertices . in each following iteration @xmath92 , @xmath88 is built from @xmath93 by conducting such operations on each existing edges as shown in fig .",
    "1 : subdivide the edge into two edges , connecting to a new vertex ; then , generate @xmath94 new vertices and attach each of them to the middle vertex of the length-2 path . in fig . 2",
    "are illustrated the first several steps of the iterative construction process corresponding to @xmath95 .",
    "clearly , it reduces to two classes of chemical graphs @xcite : the @xmath96 fractal ( when @xmath95 ) and the peano basin fractal ( when @xmath97 ) .",
    "another intuitive generation approach of the fractal @xmath88 , which will be used later , highlights the self - similarity . taking @xmath88 with @xmath98 and @xmath95 as an example ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath88 can be obtained by coalescing @xmath99 replicas of @xmath93 ( denoted by @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) with the @xmath99 outmost vertices in separate duplicates being merged into one single new vertex  the inmost vertex of @xmath88 ( e.g. the vertex with index 3 in fig .",
    "since our results will be stated for any fixed @xmath94 , we often suppress the index @xmath94 in notations .",
    "some basic properties of @xmath102 are easy to derive .",
    "for example , the number of vertices and edges are given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "we write @xmath105 as the normalized laplacian matrix of @xmath106 .",
    "its eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the normalized laplacian estrada index @xmath108 can be easily derived provided we have all the eigenvalues .      *",
    "0 and 2 are both single eigenvalues for every @xmath92 .",
    "* 1 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity @xmath110 for @xmath92 . * for @xmath92 ,",
    "all eigenvalues @xmath111 ( except 0,1 , and 2 ) at generation @xmath112 are exactly those produced via @xmath113 by using eigenvalues @xmath114 ( except 0 and 2 ) at generation @xmath89 .",
    "* we start with checking the completeness of the eigenvalues provided by the rules ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "it is direct to check that the eigenvalues for @xmath115 ( 0 , 2 , and 1 with multiplicity @xmath116 ) given by ( i ) and ( ii ) are complete .",
    "therefore , all eigenvalues ( except 0,1 , and 2 ) for @xmath88 , @xmath117 are descendants of eigenvalue 1 following ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "each father eigenvalue produces 2 child eigenvalues in the next generation .",
    "thus , the total number of eigenvalues of @xmath88 is found to be @xmath118 which implies that all eigenvalues are obtained .    since @xmath106 is connected and bipartite , ( i ) follows by lemma 1 .",
    "it suffices to show ( ii ) and that each eigenvalue @xmath119 ( except 0,1 , and 2 ) can be derived through ( [ 7 ] ) by some eigenvalue @xmath120 . since @xmath121 is similar to @xmath122 thus having the same eigenvalues , we will focus on @xmath122 in the sequel and write it as @xmath121 for simplicity .    to derive the recursive relation ( [ 7 ] ) , we resort to the so - called decimation method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath123 denote the set of vertices belonging to @xmath106 and @xmath124 the set of vertices created at iteration @xmath112 .",
    "assume that @xmath119 is an eigenvalue of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "then the eigenvalue equation for @xmath125 can be recast in the following block form @xmath127=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } i_{n_n}&\\mathcal{l}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\\\\\mathcal{l}_{\\beta,\\alpha}&\\mathcal{l}_{\\beta,\\beta } \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}u_{\\alpha}\\\\ u_{\\beta}\\end{array}\\right]=\\lambda_i(n+1)\\left[\\begin{array}{c}u_{\\alpha}\\\\ u_{\\beta}\\end{array}\\right],\\label{8}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 with @xmath129\\in\\mathbb{r}^{(m+1)\\times(m+1)}.\\ ] ] by eliminating @xmath130 from ( [ 8 ] ) we arrive at @xmath131 provided the concerned matrix is invertible .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 , with @xmath134 it is not difficult to see that @xmath135 .",
    "indeed , @xmath136 where @xmath137 means the adjugate matrix .",
    "let @xmath138 be the element on the first row and the first column of @xmath139 .",
    "we have @xmath140 which is well - defined since @xmath141 . with these preparations , it is easy to make an entry - wise comparison between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "clearly , @xmath144 ; for @xmath145 , if @xmath84 and @xmath146 are not adjacent , @xmath147 , while if @xmath84 and @xmath146 are adjacent , @xmath148 . hence",
    ", we conclude @xmath135 .    inserting the equality @xmath135 into ( [ 9 ] )",
    "we get @xmath149 where @xmath150 since @xmath151 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath152 , where @xmath120 is an eigenvalue of @xmath121 associated with the eigenvector @xmath153 . combining this with ( [ 10 ] )",
    "yields a quadratic equation , whose solution gives the formula ( [ 7 ] ) as desired .",
    "it remains to show ( ii ) .",
    "let @xmath154 represent the multiplicity of eigenvalue @xmath73 of @xmath121 .",
    "we have @xmath155 the problem of determining multiplicity is reduced to evaluating @xmath156 .",
    "( ii ) follows by showing that @xmath157 for each @xmath92 .    to show ( [ 11 ] ) we use the method of induction .",
    "for @xmath158 , we have @xmath159\\in\\mathbb{r}^{(m+3)\\times(m+3)}.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath160 . for @xmath161",

    "accordingly , @xmath165 . for @xmath117",

    "moreover , @xmath168 can be iteratively expressed as @xmath169,\\ ] ] where each @xmath170 is a matrix containing only one non - zero element @xmath171 describing the edge linking the inmost vertex in @xmath106 to one vertex in the replica @xmath172 . for any vertex @xmath173 in @xmath106 that is adjacent to the inmost vertex of @xmath106",
    ", it has a neighbor @xmath174 with degree one .",
    "hence , there is only one non - zero element for row @xmath174 and for column @xmath174 , respectively , that is , @xmath175 and @xmath176 . by using some basic operations for the matrix",
    ", we can eliminate all non - zero elements at the last row and the last column of @xmath168 .",
    "thus , @xmath177 .",
    "this yields ( [ 11 ] ) , and finally concludes the proof . @xmath85    * remark 1 . *",
    "we mention that although the eigenvalues of a related matrix of @xmath88 have been computed in @xcite by a semi - analytical method , the normalized laplacian eigenvalues can not be derived directly from results therein .    with theorem 4 at hand",
    ", the normalized laplacian estrada index can be easily evaluated through ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath88 is a connected bipartite graph with maximum degree @xmath178 and minimum degree @xmath179 . in fig",
    "3 , we display @xmath180 for @xmath181 , @xmath182 together with the obtained bounds in theorem 2 .",
    "the results gathered in fig .",
    "3 allow us to draw several interesting comments .",
    "first , as expected from theorem 2 , all values of @xmath180 lie between the upper and lower bounds .",
    "second , the lower bounds for different values of @xmath30 are collapsed together and they scale with the order of the graph as @xmath33 , which can be derived from ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the upper bound scales with @xmath1 as @xmath183 .",
    "third , @xmath180 also scales linearly with the order of the fractal , i.e. , @xmath184 , in parallel with the lower bound .",
