    "we begin by carrying out the analysis for the simplest case of eq .",
    "2 , namely for @xmath14 , which is the case of coupled shift maps .",
    "the single shift map i.e. , the linear case of the single circle map , namely @xmath14 in eq.1 is given by    @xmath15    this has periodic orbits for rational values of @xmath4 i. e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are any integers , and quasi - periodic orbits for irrational values of @xmath4 .",
    "2 , with @xmath14 , for the coupled shift map , for a lattice of @xmath19 sites , retaining periodic boundary conditions , reduces to @xmath20    for the synchronized solution , since the value of the variable at all sites is the same , we note that differences of nearest neighbour variable site values is equal to zero for all neighbours .",
    "writing an equation for such a difference for the first pair of sites of an array of @xmath19 sites , for the coupled shift map , we obtain , @xmath21 it is clear that eq.5 can be expressed completely in terms of the differences defined by @xmath22    the evolution equation of the differences is given by , @xmath23 thus , for the synchronized solution , of the coupled shift map , it is sufficient to define just @xmath19 differences , to obtain the @xmath19 equations of evolution in terms of independent variables .",
    "substituting @xmath24 , in eq.7 , gives @xmath25 , and hence shows that @xmath24 , is a spatial fixed point solution .",
    "expanding up to the linear term about this solution leads to a stability matrix @xmath26 , given by    @xmath27    this is an @xmath28 matrix , which is also circulant and whose eigen values maybe explicitly obtained analytically .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath26 are given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath19th root of unity given by + @xmath31 on simplifying , this can be written as + @xmath32    the largest eigenvalue of eq .",
    "11 namely @xmath33 defines the stability condition for temporally stable and spatially synchronised periodic orbits of the coupled shift map .",
    "the largest eigen value is + 1 , indicating that the coupled shift map is marginally stable .",
    "we find that as long as the differences between nearest neighbour sites tend to zero , we obtain synchronized solutions , irrespective of the corresponding temporal period . since , the largest eigen value does not depend on @xmath13 , we conclude that , for the synchronized solution , there is no dependence of the coupling parameter on the temporal behaviour .",
    "thus for the synchronized solution , the coupled shift map continues to have periodic orbits for rational values of @xmath34 , and quasi - periodic orbits for @xmath34 irrational , similar to the single shift map and there is no enlargement in the phase space due to the coupling .",
    "we now carry out a similar linear stability analysis with the non - linear terms i.e. for the coupled circle maps as defined in eq.2 with @xmath35 .",
    "we consider a 1-d closed chain of @xmath19 lattice sites , with the sine circle map at each site , coupled to its nearest neighbours via diffusive normalized symmetric coupling and periodic boundary conditions , as in eq.2 , such that the right hand neighbour of the @xmath19th point is the first lattice point .",
    "as discussed in the case of the coupled shift maps , for a synchronised solution , it makes sense to consider the evolution of the differences . at any arbitrary time @xmath2",
    "we write an equation similar to eq.5 , now for the coupled sine circle map .",
    "consider , as an example , the first pair of lattice sites , of a lattice of n sites , with evolution at each site defined as in eq.2 .",
    "@xmath36    eq.12 shows , that for the coupled sine circle map , the evolution equation for differences between the variable values of the nearest neighbours involves not just the differences between pairs of neighbours but also the sum of the variable values of the nearest neighbours , unlike the coupled shift map where the evolution equation could be defined in terms of the differences alone",
    ". however , it is interesting to note that for a synchronised solution , the difference of nearest neighbour lattice sites is zero , and the sum of nearest neighbour lattice sites is a @xmath37 , for a fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we write a second equation for the sums of the variables at nearest neighbour sites , and obtain ,    @xmath38    which again involves both the sums and the differences of nearest neighbours .",
    "it is clear that for the synchronized solution of a lattice of coupled sine circle maps , we now need to define @xmath19 equations for the evolution of differences of nearest neighbour sites and @xmath19 equations for the evolution of sums of nearest neighbour sites as compared to @xmath19 differences alone for the coupled shift map .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shift map is a linear version of the circle map and in the case of coupled circle maps the non - linear sine term requires the identification of the second independent variable . at any time @xmath2",
    ", we define the differences and sums , of the nearest neighbours , as follows , @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    using eq.2 , we find that that @xmath42 and @xmath43 evolve via the following eqs . @xmath44 and @xmath45    for a synchronized solution , as mentioned above , at any time @xmath2 ,    @xmath46    inserting these conditions , eq.16 reduces to @xmath47    implying that @xmath48 is a spatial fixed point solution .",
    "similarly , eq.17 reduces to @xmath49 which is again a @xmath50 ( not necessarily the same @xmath37 ) for a fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "eq.21 is not restricted to temporal evolution of any particular kind , implying that this same equation may be used to study temporally periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic behaviour . as an example",
    ", @xmath51 the same @xmath52 will indicate a temporal fixed point solution and so on .    thus @xmath42 = 0 and @xmath53 are solutions of the equations of evolution .",
    "we now perform a taylor expansion up to first order about these solutions to obtain the linear stability matrix @xmath54 which is of order 2@xmath55 and of the form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58    here @xmath59    each    @xmath60    and @xmath61    imposing the condition @xmath62 , @xmath63 the stability matrix @xmath54 , eq.22 reduces to @xmath64 where each @xmath65 is an @xmath28 circulant matrix given by , @xmath66 for a synchronised solution",
    "all the lattice sites have the same value and hence each @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "thus each @xmath69    we thus have a block diagonal matrix with circulant blocks . in the stability analysis for other coupled map lattices",
    "carried out so far , it was necessary to find a similarity transformation to obtain the stability matrix in block diagonal form @xcite . in this case , we no longer have to find such a transformation , but directly obtain the stability matrix in a block diagonal form .    to study the stability of the homogeneous solution , it is sufficient to obtain the eigenvalues of one of the blocks @xmath65 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath65 are given by eq.9 @xcite , but are now of the form    @xmath70    where @xmath30 is defined as in eq.10    on simplifying , eq.31 can be written as @xmath71    now , @xmath72 , for all r , ensures the stability of the synchronized solution .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath73 crossing 1 , is the condition for marginal stability @xcite .    as mentioned earlier , we have not assumed any temporal periodicity while defining @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "they have been defined at any arbitrary time @xmath2 .",
    "thus , as long as the condition for synchronization i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath53 is satisfied , this formalism may be used to identify and model any kind of synchronised temporal behavior .    for the synchronized solution",
    ", we can analytically obtain those regions in the @xmath74 space , for which the spatially synchronized ( i.e. spatial period 1 ) , and additionally temporal period 1 solution , is stable .      for the temporal fixed point ,",
    "i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 , is also a synchronised solution and hence also the spatial fixed point of the system .",
    "using eq.32 , the largest eigenvalue of the stability matrix @xmath54 is given by @xmath77 now , using the fixed point condition for eq.(21 ) , @xmath78    this gives @xmath79 inserting this value of @xmath80 and using the condition for stability , @xmath81 , in eq .",
    "33 , we obtain the width of the stability interval ,    @xmath82    this is the same width , as that obtained by bak _",
    "@xcite for the single circle map .",
    "this width is the width of that region of @xmath4 , for which we obtain stable fixed point solutions .",
    "thus , we find that for the synchronized solution , the width of the @xmath83 interval for the coupled circle map case is identical to that obtained for the single circle map @xcite . however , in this case , it is the width of the of the @xmath84 interval for each site , and since the value of @xmath4 at each site is the same , for the entire lattice .",
    "thus , for the region of @xmath4 , defined by eq.36 , the entire lattice , has synchronized stable temporal fixed point solutions .    for higher temporal periods , the stability matrix @xmath54 , can be obtained in the following way . for a period @xmath18 orbit , @xmath54 is simply given by , @xmath85 where all the notation is the same as defined earlier .",
    "imposing , the condition for a synchronized solution , namely , eqs.18 and 19 , @xmath54 reduces to the following form @xmath86 the widths of the the higher temporal periods , for the synchronized case can not be obtained analytically , as has previously been observed in the case of the single circle map @xcite . to calculate the widths of the higher temporal periods , for the synchronized solution we carry out numerical simulations which have been discussed in section iv .",
    "a detailed discussion is presented in @xcite .",
    "since the formalism set up here is sufficiently general , it may also be used to model synchronisation in other coupled map systems .",
    "the next section extends the formalism for solutions corresponding to arbitrary spatial periods .",
    "we find that the formalism discussed above may be efficiently used to study the stability of higher spatial periods as well .",
    "we extend it to higher spatial periods with the stability matrix retaining its block diagonal form . by higher spatial periods ,",
    "say spatial period 4 , we mean every @xmath10th and @xmath88th lattice site will have the same value .",
    "( see fig.1b )    we now extend this formalism , to an arbitrary spatial period @xmath87 . at any time @xmath2 , for a spatial period @xmath87 solution",
    ", the value of the variable at the @xmath10th site is the same as the value at the @xmath89th site .",
    "thus , the difference , between the variable values of the @xmath10th and the @xmath89th site , approaches zero , while the sum of these variable values , approaches a constant . as discussed in section",
    "ii , now for a spatial period @xmath87 , we can show that the differences and sums , are again the independent variables of the system and are now defined as , @xmath90 @xmath91 where the superscript @xmath87 denotes the spatial period at any time @xmath2 .",
    "eqs.16 and 17 , now for a spatial period @xmath87 , are modified to , @xmath92 and @xmath93    as shown in section ii , here too it can be easily shown that , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 are all @xmath97 , and are solutions of the eq .",
    "41 and 42 for a fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "+ for a spatial period @xmath87 solution , we expand about , @xmath98 and @xmath99 and obtain the stability matrix @xmath100 + @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 are defined by eq.25 here , each @xmath105 and @xmath106    imposing the conditions @xmath98 and @xmath95 , the stability matrix @xmath107 given by eq.43 again reduces to a block diagonal form @xmath108 where each @xmath109 is of the form , @xmath110 and each @xmath111 where , each @xmath112 goes from @xmath113 see fig.1(b ) for an illustration of spatial period 4 .    thus even for higher spatial periods ,",
    "the stability matrix @xmath107 is in a block diagonal form , eq.48 .",
    "finding the eigen values of the matrix @xmath114 , and the largest eigen value crossing + 1 , gives the region of stability of the period @xmath87 solution .",
    "we obtained the width of @xmath115 , the temporal period 1 case , for the synchronized solution analytically in section ii .",
    "the higher temporal periods , @xmath116 , for the synchronized solution , are obtained numerically .",
    "the widths , @xmath117 , as also stated in section ii , are those regions of @xmath4 , at @xmath7 , for which , the entire lattice , will have temporally stable and spatially synchronized periodic solutions of time period @xmath18 .",
    "we extend the algorithm developed by bak _",
    "et al _ @xcite , in the following manner .",
    "for a lattice of @xmath19 sites we define the following vector notation , @xmath118    where @xmath10 denotes the lattice index and each @xmath119 is defined by eq.2 each @xmath120 is now a vector of the form    @xmath121    and the parameter , @xmath4 , also a vector , is represented as @xmath122    @xmath4 , in principle may have different values at each site , but in this case has the same value at each site .    for a 1-d array of coupled sine circle maps , i.e. a multi - dimensional case , the stability criterion",
    "is obtained by examining the eigen values of the following @xmath123 matrix @xmath124 let @xmath125 be the set of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath126 . for a period @xmath18 orbit to be stable the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath127 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue crossing 1 defines the marginal stability condition .",
    "thus for the higher order temporal periods , we seek the solution to the set of eqs .",
    "55 and 56 , @xmath128 the condition for closure , and    @xmath129    the condition for marginal stability    for a general @xmath130 step , and a lattice of @xmath19 sites , we start with homogeneous initial conditions and perform the iterative technique based on the newton - raphson method .",
    "we define @xmath131 where @xmath132 and so on .",
    "we further define ,    @xmath133    where now , @xmath134    for the synchronized solution , it can be shown , that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix , @xmath126 , namely @xmath135 , is equal to each of the @xmath19 components of @xmath136 in eq.58 @xcite .",
    "therefore , eqs.55 and 56 , may now be expressed as finding @xmath137 such that @xmath138    taylor expanding @xmath139 , about the initial point of iteration , @xmath140 , up to the linear order , we obtain , @xmath141 where @xmath142    @xmath143    it is found that , for @xmath144 @xmath145 and so as a first approximation , @xmath146    all derivatives can be derived recursively @xcite    we start with homogeneous initial conditions , for the synchronized case , and find , to initiate the iteration , it is convenient to locate the superstable point @xmath147 , for all the lattice sites , where now the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath126 are = 0 .",
    "all steps have been found to an accuracy of @xmath148 .    using the alogrithm discussed above , at @xmath149",
    "we obtain the complete devil s staircase , of periodic orbits , now in the @xmath150 space ( see fig.2 ) with all the special features seen in the single circle map .",
    "we also studied various features of the coupled sine circle map lattice at lower values of @xmath3 and different @xmath4 s .",
    "our simulations reveal synchronized quasi - periodic orbits and periodic orbits in the @xmath151 space.we thus obtain the entire structure of the arnold tongues ( see fig.3 ) now with the third coupling dimension @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear from ( see fig .",
    "3 that the three possible routes to chaos seen in the case of the single circle map i.e. via mode - locking alone , via quasi - periodicity and mode - locking and via quasi - periodicity to chaos , will also be seen for the coupled sine circle map lattice .",
    "thus for the synchronized solution , we obtain all the features of the single map , now with a third dimension , in the form of the coupling parameter .",
    "we also observe that for the synchronised solution all the features as seen in the single circle map , are lifted exactly to this extra dimension in the parameter space , namely the coupling parameter @xmath13 , for the entire range , @xmath152 .",
    "we have set up a formalism to analyze the phenomenon of synchronization in a lattice of coupled sine circle maps .",
    "we identify the independent variables , the differences and the sums of variable values at neighbouring sites , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the problem and show that , @xmath153 and @xmath53 , the synchronised solution , are solutions , of the system under consideration . casting the evolution equations in terms of these independent variables",
    "leads to a stability matrix which is in a neat block diagonal form .",
    "in addition , these blocks have a circulant structure , so we have a block diagonal matrix with circulant blocks . the temporal fixed point case , for the synchronised solution , i.e. the spatial period one and temporal period one solution can be solved explicitly to obtain the corresponding width of the stability interval .",
    "we have also demonstrated that this analysis can be easily extended to higher spatial periods .",
    "for an arbitrary spatial period @xmath87 , we identify the independent variables , now @xmath154 and @xmath155 and again show that @xmath156 and @xmath157 , are solutions of the system .",
    "a linear stability analysis for this case shows that the stability matrix retains its block diagonal form .",
    "this analysis may also be easily extended to spatially periodic behaviour in other coupled map systems .",
    "the analysis is one of the simplest presented so far with the additional advantage of being transparent and neat .",
    "we calculate the widths of the higher temporal periods for the synchronized case , by extending the algorithm developed by bak_et al _ @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations reveal that the for the synchronised case , the entire structure of the arnold tongues and the devil s staircase as observed for the single circle map is lifted to the chain of coupled sine circle maps .",
    "a study of the parameter basins of attraction , i.e. those regions in the @xmath158 , where a particular class of initial conditions converges to the synchronized solution , which is the attractor , have also been carried out .",
    "these results which have been presented elsewhere @xcite showed that these regions were found to be fairly large and showed an interesting symmetry about @xmath159 .",
    "random initial conditions also revealed a finite basin of attraction , which was also symmetric about @xmath159 .",
    "the numerical simulations for the random initial conditions showed that there always exists a finite region of the @xmath160 parameter space , at @xmath7 , for which synchronized solutions will be obtained .",
    "the temporal period for these synchronized regions was found to be 1.@xcite .",
    "investigation of higher spatial periods reveals extremely interesting structures , results of which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our analysis was carried out for the homogenous case which assumed that the parameter values at each lattice site were the same .",
    "however the formalism set up is completely general and can be easily extended to inhomogeneous cases .",
    "this should be useful for the study of lattices where some lattice sites function as pinning sites .",
    "we hope this work will find useful applications in the study of spatially periodic behaviour in systems like josephson junction arrays and coupled oscillator arrays and in studies of pattern formation , in reaction - diffusion systems and charge - density waves .",

    "<S> since the single sine circle map exhibits this tendency to mode - lock , it is interesting to study whether an array of such sine circle maps on a lattice suitably coupled , would demonstrate such a mode - locking spatially . </S>",
    "<S> synchronization is the simplest example of such a phenomenon and we focus our attention on the synchronized states which are temporally periodic in an array of such coupled circle maps .    the specific model under study , is a 1-dimensional coupled map lattice of sine - circle maps with nearest neighbour diffusive symmetric normalized coupling ( also called future coupled laplacian coupling ) and periodic boundary conditions , and is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the angular variable associated with the @xmath10th site , at time @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> + the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are taken to be uniform at each site and defined as in eq.2 for the single circle map , + and @xmath13 which lies between 0 and 1 is the strength of the coupling parameter .    we investigate in detail the phenomena of spatial synchronization in a system of such coupled sine circle maps . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the spatially homogeneous and temporally periodic , quasi - periodic and chaotic modes of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a linear stability analysis to analyse the stability properties of the spatially synchronized , temporally periodic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the independent variables of the problem are identified and the analysis is cast in terms of these independent variables . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a neat and simple block diagonal form for the stability matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this permits us to identify the regions in parameter space where synchronized solutions of different temporal periods are stable.the limits of the mode - locked interval for the temporal period one case can be explicitly evaluated due to the fact that the stability matrix has a block diagonal , block circulant structure , for this case . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is also extended to higher spatial periods . </S>",
    "<S> our method is quite general and should prove to be useful in the study of spatially periodic behaviour in other coupled map lattice models as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is divided into five sections . </S>",
    "<S> section i discusses the coupled shift map , which is the linear version of the coupled circle map , namely @xmath14 in eq .2 , and is thus the simplest case . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the independent variables for this system and recast the equation of evolution in terms of these variables . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a systematic linear stability analysis , and obtain a neat form for the stability matrix . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we extend the formalism to the system of coupled sine circle maps , taking into account the nonlinear sine term as defined in eq . 2 and cast the problem in terms of the new independent variables of this system . the linear stability analysis in terms of these variables , gives a neat block diagonal form for the stability matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by an explicit calculation of the eigenvalues for the synchronized solution and the evaluation of the limits of the mode - locked interval for the fixed point case . </S>",
    "<S> section iii presents the generalization to higher spatial periods . in section iv , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations for the higher temporal periods , of the synchronized solution , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the algorithm developed by bak _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , for the single circle map , to the synchronized solution of a system of coupled sine circle maps.section v concludes with results and a short discussion . </S>"
