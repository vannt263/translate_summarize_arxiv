    "necessity for `` weaker '' than verbunt & zwaan aml by msw was suggested e.g. by @xcite for cataclysmic variables and by @xcite for sxt .    in paper",
    "i we suggested , in line with observational evidence mentioned above , that magnetic braking operates on a much reduced scale ( as compared with @xcite prescription ) or that it does not operate at all in the semidetached systems with black - hole accretors . as a test of this hypothesis , we computed a population of lmbhb under assumption that msw is not operating once the rlof occurs .",
    "since the mechanism that brings the systems to the rlof is the same both in `` standard '' and in `` no - msw '' cases , the number of semidetached systems is the same in both models ( @xmath61 ) , but in the latter case , because of a weaker aml , there are currently in the galaxy about 5000 lmbhb that evolve to shorter periods and have @xmath62 ( compared to @xmath63 in the former case ) .",

    "the essential information available on the companion - stars in sxt is their spectral types .",
    "determination of the latter is a challenging task since the emission of the cool star is contaminated by the radiation from the accretion disc and the hot spot where the accretion stream hits the disc s edge @xcite .",
    "different methods of _",
    "sp_-determination result in a scatter of assigned spectra that may amount to several subtypes ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) . in the absence of direct determinations of such parameters of the stars as their effective temperatures and masses ( for a few exceptions",

    "we adopted for the present study @xmath70 relation by tokunaga and @xmath71 relation by schmidt - kaler given in @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pte ] and [ fig : pm2 ] we plot , respectively , effective temperatures of the donors and their masses in model population vs. orbital periods of the systems . in the absence of objective criteria for discrimination of reliable vs. non - reliable @xmath72-determinations",

    "however , we should note the following . in order to avoid interpolation between pre - computed tracks that evolve upon rlof continuously to shorter periods and tracks that turn to longer periods immediately or change the direction of evolution in @xmath67",
    ", we restricted ourselves by binaries that evolve to short . for a system with given @xmath76 and @xmath37 the direction of evolution changes quite abruptly , over a narrow range of initial @xmath77  day .",
    "for a given combination of @xmath76 and @xmath37 a `` gap '' between tracks evolving in different directions forms .",

    "but since there is a continuity in the initial parameters of the systems , the `` gap '' has to be filled by the systems that start rlof in the well populated area in the @xmath78 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p0m20 ] ) .",
    "thus it is at least qualitatively clear that the origin of short - period lmbhb may be explained within paradigm of strong reduction of magnetic braking in systems with donors overflowing roche lobes .",
    "in our model we reduced aml by msw to zero . in reality some aml by msw can be still operating .",
    "we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : pte ] and [ fig : pm2 ] two `` limiting '' tracks : for ( 1 + 12 ) , @xmath79 hr in which the donor overflows roche lobe almost unevolved and msw is absent after rlof and for ( 1 + 4 ) , @xmath80 hr in which donor has @xmath81 at rlof and msw continues to operate .",
    "crudely , model populations with msw and without msw that evolve to short have to be located between these two limiting curves .",
    "there is a contribution of lower and higher mass systems of course as we plotted tracks for 1  donors for simplicity . adding some aml to our model will shift the population to the right , giving a better agreement with observations while still not producing stable luminous x - ray sources . from fig .",
    "6 in paper i it is seen that such an adding of aml will influence mainly the long - period systems .",
    "our computations for the `` no - msw '' model show that lmbhb evolve to longer periods if @xmath3 at rlof .",
    "for instance a 1.1  donor with @xmath82  ( middle curve ) spends in the rlof - state almost 10  gyr , out",
    "of which about 5  gyr it evolves to longer periods .",
    "this provides a possibility of explaining sxts with periods @xmath83 9 - 10 hr .",
    "our model predicts the distribution of sxt over mass - transfer rates  that can also be compared to  deduced from observations of sxt sources .",
    "usually ,  for sxt are evaluated by dividing the mass accreted during outburst by the recurrence time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among short - period sxt",
    "the recurrence time is known only for a0620 - 00 ( about 60 years ) and 4u  1543 - 47 ( about 10 years ) . for the other systems one can only obtain upper limits of  since only one outburst has been seen in the x - ray observations epoch ( 30 years are usually assumed ) .",
    "these estimates of , derived from the data on outburst parameters from @xcite and for kv uma and v406 vul based of observations presented in @xcite and @xcite respectively , are shown as plusses in figs .",
    "[ fig : dim ] and [ fig : mnl ] .    for the `` standard '' model all above - described -estimates are inconsistent with the model ( two upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] ) . even if only gwr acts , @xmath84  can not be explained if one assumes that they represent _ secular _ values ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] ) .",
    "it would take post - minimum period systems several hubble times to reach @xmath85 hr and have a secular @xmath84 .",
    "if the extremely low  deduced for short period sxts were due to downward fluctuations from an intrinsically high secular , one would still have to explain why the bright counterparts are not observed (   [ sec : stable ] ) .",
    "furthermore , some systems would then necessarily have higher rates than their secular value , hence there should be even more persistent systems .    in paper",
    "i we have shown that in the `` standard '' model systems with @xmath86 hr may be consistent with systems where donors overflow roche lobes extremely close to tams , but then one needs to assume some very special initial distribution of binaries over orbital separations which will after several evolutionary stages with mass transfer and mass and momentum loss from the system and supernova explosion , result in concentration of zero - age black - hole and main - sequence - star systems just at the desired very narrow range of separations .",
    "on the other hand , if a small amount of aml is added to the alternative `` no - msw '' model , the latter will become consistent with recurrence time based estimates of  for observed @xmath86 hr systems , as shows comparison of two lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] .",
    "the longest period sxt of the `` short - period '' group , 4u1543 - 47 ( @xmath87hr ; it is not shown in the figures ) is , in principle , consistent with the evolution of `` standard '' model systems with donors overflowing roche - lobes after formation of he - cores .",
    "but again , these binaries evolve through the hertzsprung gap extremely fast , and the probability of observing such systems is very low ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". in the `` no - msw '' model , formation of the systems similar to 4u1543 - 47 is much easier explained , since to the range of periods about 13 hr slowly enough evolve binaries with @xmath88  donors which overfilled roche lobes having @xmath89 .",
    "it is , however , plausible that the  in short - period sxts are much higher than  derived above . these  were obtained treating accretion disc as a reservoir which during quiescence is filled up to a critical value at which the outburst is triggered and the disc emptied .",
    "the implicit assumption is that the reservoir is not leaky , i.e. that the accretion rate at the disc s inner edge is much smaller than .",
    "however , the inner truncation of the discs is required to explain observed quiescent luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same may be true for non - quiescent discs too ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the disc instability model can reproduce the observed x - ray light - curves only if discs in sxts are truncated and irradiated .",
    "the truncated ( or `` leaky '' ) disc paradigm is now commonly used in describing the observed timing and spectral properties of x - ray lmbhb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for systems with",
    "_ non - stationary _ quiescent accretion discs can be estimated as @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the maximum quiescent - disc mass ( in @xmath92 ) and @xmath93  the fraction of the disc s mass lost during outburst ; @xmath94 is the kinematic viscosity parameter , @xmath50 is the disc s outer radius in @xmath51 cm and @xmath95 is the accretion rate at the disc s inner edge .",
    "the usual , non - leaky disc estimates , neglect @xmath95 . however , in sxts @xmath95 is the dominant term as argued by @xcite .",
    "according to the dim , the disc is in cold thermal equilibrium if accretion rate at all annuli satisfies the inequality @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97  the viscosity parameter in 0.1 .",
    "therefore , the mass accretion rate at the truncation radius ( @xmath95 ) must be smaller than @xmath98 . parameterizing the truncation radius as a fraction of the circularization radius @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 , see *",

    "one can therefore conclude that a substantially reduced msw aml would be consistent with both the stability properties and of sxts .",
    "possible problem of excess of sxt in our model mentioned in   [ sec : stable ] may be resolved in the model suggested by @xcite ( henceforth , mnl ) .",
    "mnl pointed out that if the truncation radii were slightly larger than estimated to fit observations of quiescent sxts the discs would be globally stable , since their accretion rates are lower than the critical value given by eq .",

    "this is because  in the gwr - only scenario are lower than in the msw+gwr scenario , thereby enabling the criterion for a cold disc to be met more easily .",
    "truncating the disc at r@xmath109 would make all transients `` mnl - stable '' for both models .",
    "therefore , it is possible that most or even all lmbhb are secularly cold / stable systems , erupting from time to time due to randomly acting factors like variability of truncation radii or mass transfer rate .",
    "the predicted population size of these systems is too small to contribute significantly to the large number of faint ( @xmath110  erg  s@xmath17 ) hard x - ray sources seen in the deep _ chandra _ exposures toward the galactic center @xcite .",

    "an alternative model suggests that if accretion discs are truncated in quiescence they could be cold and stable .",
    "then truncation of discs at radii close to @xmath115 can make discs in virtually all lmbhb cold and stable . in this case",
    "sxt outbursts perhaps are not related to dim and are random events that result from `` external factors '' , like episodes of enhanced mass transfer or variability in truncation radius .",
    "population synthesis models presented above are obtained under assumption of a high value of the product of binding energy parameter of stellar envelopes and expulsion efficiency of common envelopes  = 2 .",

    "apart of common envelopes , crucial role in determining the possibility of formation of lmbhb is played by stellar wind mass - loss in all stages of stellar evolution , since it defines parameters of the system at the beginning of common envelope stage and immediately before supernova explosion that gives birth to black hole .",
