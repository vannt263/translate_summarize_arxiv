    ", people are now exploring the possibility for scaling up to many qubits .",
    "two - qubit experiments have been performed in superconducting charge @xcite , flux @xcite and phase @xcite qubits and the entanglement has been observed .",
    "usually , the interaction between qubits in these experiments is always on during the manipulation .",
    "there are many theoretical proposals @xcite for coupling any pair of qubits selectively through a common data bus or by adding additional sub - circuits .",
    "there are currently experimental efforts in implementing these proposals .",
    "recently , superconducting qubits coupled to an @xmath1 oscillator or one - dimensional superconducting transmission line resonator ( stlr ) @xcite has attracted much interest .",
    "such systems were of great interest not only in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics of open systems but also as the potential candidates of scalable superconducting quantum computers . in the ion - trap quantum computer @xcite",
    ", the harmonic oscillator played an important role as data bus .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1 oscillator or stlr can also play the role of data bus .",
    "data - bus plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite . with the help of data bus , state transfer @xcite and @xmath2-qubit controlled phase gate @xcite for superconducting phase qubits",
    "were proposed . by coupling a charge qubit with a micro - cavity",
    ", macroscopic superposition states can be generated by manipulating the gate voltage and external flux in an elegant way in refs .",
    "@xcite . by using the appropriate time - dependent electromagnetic fields ,",
    "@xcite presented a scheme of scalable circuit for superconducting flux qubits , where quantum two - gate is realized by applying an external classical light fields .",
    "the work of @xcite provides a scalable superconducting quantum computer scheme using flux qubit .",
    "inspired by the interesting idea in ref.@xcite , we present a scalable superconducting charge quantum computer scheme up to many qubits with the assistance of stlr playing the role of data bus . in this scheme , both single- and two- qubit gates can be implemented by just controlling the gate voltage and externally applied flux .",
    "it is found that bell states and @xmath0 states can be generated quickly in a simple way .",
    "the single superconducting charge qubit consists of a small superconducting island with cooper - pair charge @xmath3 connected by two identical josephson junctions(each with capacitance @xmath4 and josephson coupling energy @xmath5 ) to a superconducting electrode .",
    "this is the structure of a dc squid . a gate voltage @xmath6 is coupled to the superconducting island through gate capacitance @xmath7 .",
    "the gate voltage @xmath6 and externally applied flux @xmath8 are externally controlled and used to bias the superconducting island and the dc squid .",
    "a schematic diagram of the single - qubit structure is show in fig.[qubit ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the single - cooper - pair charging energy of the island , @xmath11 is the gate charge induced by the gate voltage , @xmath12 is the effective josephson coupling energy and @xmath13 is the flux quantum .     and @xmath4 .",
    "the gate voltage @xmath6 and externally applied flux @xmath8 are used to bias the superconducting island and the dc squid.,width=144 ]    in the charge regime , that is @xmath14 , and in the neighborhood of @xmath15 , only two charge states , say @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are relevant . in the representation of this two charge states ,",
    "the reduced two - state hamiltonian can be written in the spin-@xmath18 form @xmath19 the eigenvalues of single - qubit hamiltonian are @xmath20 and eigenstates @xmath21 where @xmath22 in the representation of eigenbasis , the hamiltonian is diagonalized as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "here we consider the one - dimensional cavity realized by stlr @xcite .",
    "for an ideal one - dimensional stlr with length @xmath26 and the boundary conditions @xmath27 , the quantized current is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 is the inductance ( capacitance ) per unit length .",
    "the hamiltonian of the stlr reads @xmath32 consider the @xmath33-th mode of the stlr , the current @xmath34 placing the superconducting qubits at the points @xmath35 , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary integer , the hamiltonian of the combined system reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the quantized magnetic flux induced by the quantized current , @xmath38 is the distance between the qubit and stlr and @xmath39 is the area enclosed by the dc squid . here , for simplicity , we denote @xmath40 as @xmath41 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 . generally speaking , @xmath44 , then the hamiltonian([h1 ] )",
    "approximately reads @xmath45 in the eigenbasis of the qubit s hamiltonian and under the rotating - wave approximation , the total hamiltonian of the combined system ( qubit and stlr ) reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the coupling coefficient of qubit and stlr @xmath49",
    "any unitary transformation can be constructed from a set of basic elementary gates .",
    "we adopt the scheme for single qubit manipulation in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , different from the flux - qubit in ref.@xcite , two - qubit gate in our scheme is realized by adjusting the gate voltage and the externally applied flux .    *",
    "single qubit manipulation can be easily implemented . * in the hamiltonian eq.([jc ] ) , which has been well studied in quantum optics @xcite , in the large detuning limit , that is @xmath50 , the interaction between qubit and stlr can be neglected @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the single qubit manipulation may be implemented by changing @xmath51 and @xmath8 rapidly , as if the superconducting transmission line were absent .",
    "it has already been demonstrated in general in experiments @xcite .",
    "* we now study the two - qubit gate*. by controlling gate voltage and the externally applied flux , one can set a qubit resonating with the stlr , that is @xmath52 . in the resonant case ,",

    ", @xmath2 is an arbitrary integer . @xmath8 and @xmath55 are externally applied flux and flux induced by the transmission line.,width=288 ]    a scalable quantum circuit can be constructed by placing @xmath56 charge qubits at the points @xmath57 along the stlr acting as the data bus , as shown in fig.[scalable ] , and a similar setup where the qubits are connected by capacitances has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite where phase transition has been studied in detail .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath58    if the detuning between each qubit and stlr is great larger than their coupling constants , that is @xmath59 , then all n qubits are decoupled from the cavity , so one can do the single - qubit operations as discussed above .    to implement two - qubit manipulations ,",
    "the selected two qubits should be sequentially coupled to the stlr .",
    "suppose we want to implement a two - qubit manipulation acting on the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubits , we can sequentially setting the the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th resonating with the stlr .",
    "firstly , we consider how to implement a two - qubit phase gate .",
    "initially set the stlr in the vacuum state @xmath16 , and let the @xmath60-th qubit , the @xmath61-th qubit and then the @xmath60-th qubit sequentially resonating with the stlr for time duration @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 , according to formulas ( [ evolution ] ) , the dynamical evolutions of the four states @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are    @xmath70    with    @xmath71    here , we assume that eigenfrequencies @xmath72s of qubits are different when the qubits are not resonant with the stlr .",
    "in fact , the result wo nt be affected even if the eigenfrequencies @xmath72s are equal .",
    "after the dynamical evolutions with the given time durations , a two - qubit phase gate is constructed as follows @xmath73 because all of the two - qubit gates are universal @xcite , any two qubit operation can be obtained by combining the two - qubit phase gate @xmath74 with well - chosen single - qubit operations for the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubits .",
    "therefore , quantum computation can be realized by combination of two - qubit phase gate with single - qubit operations .",
    "the entangled state between the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubits can be easily generated with the assistance of stlr .",
    "if two qubits , say the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubits , resonate with the stlr simultaneously , the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath75 here , for simplicity , we assumed that the coupling coefficient @xmath76 is the same when qubits resonate with the stlr .",
    "the eigenvalues of hamiltonian eq.([h2 ] ) are    @xmath77    and the corresponding eigenvectors are    [ eigenvector ] @xmath78    the ground state of hamiltonian eq.([h2 ] ) is @xmath79 and the corresponding energy is @xmath80 . from the eigen - states , it is easy to write out the evolution of the system .",
    "for instance if the initial state of the system is @xmath81 , the state at time @xmath82 will be @xmath83.\\label{bell}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath84 , the state of the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubits is a bell - state becomes a bell - state @xmath85 . usually , the state of the stlr is in the vacuum state @xmath16 , to prepare the system in state @xmath81 , we first start from state @xmath86 , then setting @xmath60-th qubit resonating with stlr for a time duration @xmath87 , and according to eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , the state becomes @xmath81 .",
    "then the bell - state is obtained by setting @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubit resonating simultaneously with the stlr for a period of @xmath88 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the generation of @xmath0 states of arbitrary three qubits . using sequential resonance between qubits and stlr ,",
    "the @xmath0 states can be generated in a similar way to the generation of bell states .",
    "we consider the @xmath60-th , @xmath61-th and @xmath33-th qubits .",
    "suppose the initial states of the three qubits @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath33 and stlr are @xmath89 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and vacuum state @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "firstly , setting the @xmath33-th qubit resonating with stlr for a time duration @xmath91 , according to eq.([evolution ] ) , the evolution of state of the @xmath33-th qubit and stlr is @xmath92 here , we neglect a global phase factor @xmath93 .",
    "secondly , setting the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th qubit resonating with stlr for a time duration @xmath94 , according to eq.([eigenvector ] ) , the state of the combined system ( three qubits and stlr ) becomes @xmath95.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the resonating time @xmath94 satisfies @xmath96 , that is @xmath97 , the state of the combined system reads @xmath98|0\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we neglect a global phase factor @xmath99 and the subscripts @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath33 .",
    "if the resonating time @xmath91 satisfies @xmath100 , we can get the @xmath0 state of the three qubits @xmath101,\\ ] ] the signs @xmath102 depends on the value of @xmath103 .",
    "it s notable that the coupling coefficient @xmath104 is different in the single - qubit operation and two - qubit gate operation , because @xmath104 is the function of @xmath105 ; moreover , @xmath8 and @xmath106 are external controlled and different between single - qubit operation and two - qubit gate operation .",
    "however , the single qubit operation will not be affected so long as the condition @xmath107 is satisfied during the single - qubit operation , and @xmath104 can be tuned to its maximum value when the two - qubit gate operation begins . in this paper , we consider the current coupling between the superconducting charge qubit and the stlr , however , the same result can be achieved by voltage coupling .    in conclusion , we have presented a scheme for scalable superconducting charge qubits with the assistance of stlr playing the role of data bus .",
    "the coupling between the selected qubit and the stlr can be turned on and off by just controlling the gate voltage and externally applied flux of the superconducting qubit . as a result",
    ", the single - qubit manipulation can be performed when the qubit decoupled with the stlr , and two - qubit gate can be implemented by setting two qubits sequentially resonating with the stlr .",
    "the entanglement state between arbitrary two qubits and @xmath0 state of arbitrary three qubits can be generated easily and quickly .",
    "the operation time in our scheme is much shorter than the decoherence time of superconducting charge qubits according to recent experiments @xcite .",
    "different from the flux qubit gate case where two - qubit gate needs a tdef , both single- and two- qubit gates are implemented by changing the gate voltage and the external flux in our scheme , the same set of devices can be used for both of them , which is appealing to experiment .",
