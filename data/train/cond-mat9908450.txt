    "nonequilibrium systems of diffusing reactants are very common in nature . in chemistry",
    "almost any chemical reaction is a reaction - diffusion system . in physics ,",
    "the standard examples are annihilation of electrons and holes moving in a disordered media , or vortices and antivortices in type two superconductors .",
    "examples from other fields include : population dynamics in biology , spread of epidemics in health science , and group decision dynamics in social science .",
    "it is customary to denote the various types of reactants by capital letters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc . , and the rates of the reactions by greek letters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "then , for example , a process in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 annihilate each other at rate @xmath4 is represented symbolically as : @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , a process where the reaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 produces @xmath2 , at rate @xmath3 , is represented by @xmath7 .",
    "the simplest description of reaction - diffusion dynamics employs the densities of the reactants as the basic ingredients of the equations of motion . for example",
    ", the equation describing the binary annihilation reaction @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the density of the reactants , and @xmath11 is their diffusion constant .",
    "the first term in the above equation represents the diffusive behavior of the particles , while the second term accounts for the interaction . we shall call these kind of equations `` mean field equations '' for reasons which will be clarified later on .",
    "the evolution of many nonequilibrium processes are adequately described by mean field equations .",
    "one of the most remarkable examples is the belousov - zhabotinskii reaction @xcite where a mixture of few chemical reactants produces a nonequilibrium process which is periodic in time .    facing the success the the mean field theory , it is natural to ask whether , indeed , it always gives an accurate description of reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "in fact , it is known that the answer for this question is negative .",
    "deviations from the mean field theory appear , usually , in systems of low dimensionality .",
    "returning to the example ( [ aa ] ) , it can be easily seen that the homogeneous solution of equation ( [ aae ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath12 , independent of the dimensionality of the system . however , the true asymptotic behavior of ( [ aa ] ) is @xmath13 in @xmath14 , @xmath15 in @xmath16 , and @xmath12 , for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is the critical dimension for reaction - diffusion type of nonequilibrium processes .",
    "the qualitative explanation for this behavior is clear : in order to react , the two particles should first diffuse to make contact .",
    "this diffusion time restricts the rate of the reaction since , in low dimensions , diffusion is inefficient in mixing the reactants .",
    "the ovchinnikov - zeldovich segregation phenomenon @xcite is the result of spatially inactive regions developed in diffusion limited reactions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present an example for nonequilibrium process in which the discretized nature of the reactants has a strong impact on the behavior : the mean field equations fail to describe the dynamics of the system in the long time limit .",
    "discretization effects lead to a different asymptotic behavior of the system in the long time limit .",
    "this change is , in a sense , analogous to a quantum phase transition .",
    "the prototype example we shall use is one of the simplest models in population biology : the lotka - volterra system @xcite . in the predator - prey version of this model , two species , a predator ( a ) and a prey ( b ) are interacting while all other environmental factors are assumed intact . in the absence of predator , the prey population grows exponentially , while in the absence of prey the predator death rate results in an exponential decay of their population .",
    "binary interaction between the species involves the growth of the predator population due to consumption of the prey , thus : @xmath19 where @xmath3 is the predator death rate , @xmath5 is the prey birth rate , and @xmath4 is the probability for a predator to eat a prey at the same spatial location .",
    "we assume that birth of a new predator follows an  eating event \" at the same site .",
    "the mean field equations of this system are the lotka - volterra equations : @xmath20    = 6.0 cm    [ loops ]    here @xmath10 and @xmath21 denote the population densities of the predator and prey , respectively , and it is assumed that the diffusion constants of both species equal to @xmath11 . the generic behavior of this system is periodic in time , see fig .",
    "[ loops ] : when the number prey is large , the predator population is growing due to the availability of food , but then the prey population decreases .",
    "consequently , also the predator population diminishes .",
    "when the predator population is already small , the number of prey , again , begins growing and the cycle repeats .    here , we will show that the behavior of the quantized version of this model , in two dimensions , does not follow the lotka - volterra equations ( [ lve ] ) .",
    "our analysis will proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we write down the exact master equations of the quantized version of the system . then , we map these equations onto a a schrdinger equation in imaginary time , and identify the corresponding many - body hamiltonian .",
    "next , we express the propagator of the system as a field integral and find the corresponding action .",
    "it will be shown that the mean field equations ( [ lve ] ) are the saddle point equations associated with this action .",
    "the effective action of the system will be , then , constructed following the traditional procedure of renormalization .",
    "namely , the fields will be separated into  fast \" and  slow \" components , and the fast components will be integrated out .",
    "finally , we analyze the saddle point equation of the effective action and characterize the long time asymptotic behavior of the system .",
    "our results will be verified by numerical simulations .    to avoid cumbersome algebraic manipulations",
    ", our discussion will be switching between two processes : the binary annihilation ( [ aa ] ) , and the lotka - volterra reaction ( [ lvp ] ) .",
    "the first example will be used as a simple illustration of the derivation , while the results for the lotka - volterra reaction will be usually stated without an explicit derivation .",
    "the master equations of a nonequilibrium process are equations for the probabilities of the various states of the system .",
    "consider the binary annihilation process ( [ aa ] ) in zero dimension , i.e. when the system consists of a single site .",
    "then , a state of the system is defined by the number of reactants , @xmath22 , and we denote the probability to find the system in this state by @xmath23 .",
    "the master equations relate the change of probability in time to the rate of flow into and out of the state : @xmath24 . \\label{aam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right hand side represents the flow out of the state with @xmath22 reactants .",
    "it comes from pair annihilation , and therefore proportional to the number of pairs , @xmath25 .",
    "the second term accounts for the flow into the state which is due to pair annihilation in the state with @xmath26 reactants .",
    "the same logic can be used in order to construct the master equations for the lotka - volterra process ( [ lvp ] ) .",
    "considering again the zero dimensional case , they take the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the probability to find the system in a state with @xmath29 predator and @xmath22 prey .",
    "the generalization of the above equations to the non - zero dimensional case is straightforward .",
    "a state of the system is now defined by two vectors of integer numbers : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the components of these vectors represent the occupation numbers of the prey and the predator at the various sites of the system , and @xmath32 is the joint probability of the occupation configurations .",
    "the master equations , in this case , contain an additional hopping term between the sites .",
    "this term will be added to our theory later on .",
    "we turn now to map the master equations onto the schrdinger equation in imaginary time , and to identify the corresponding many - body hamiltonian . beginning with the example of binary annihilation process in zero dimensions , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we define the wave function @xmath33 denotes a state with @xmath22 reactants in the system .",
    "taking the derivative of @xmath34 with respect to time and substituting ( [ aam ] ) we obtain @xmath35 |n \\rangle .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us now introduce the creation , @xmath36 , and annihilation , @xmath37 , operators which satisfy the bose commutation relation @xmath38=1 $ ] , and @xmath39 it is easy to see that @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . substituting these results in equation ( [ aai ] ) ,",
    "one can write it in the from of a schrdinger equation in imaginary time @xmath42 where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath43    turning to the lotka - volterra reaction in zero dimension , we denote by @xmath44 the state with @xmath29 predator and @xmath22 prey .",
    "the corresponding wave function is @xmath45 , and the equations of motion take the same form as ( [ se ] ) , but with the hamiltonian : @xmath46 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the creation and annihilation operators of predator , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the creation and annihilation operators of prey .",
    "the generalization of equation ( [ se ] ) to the nonzero dimensional case is obtained by defining the creation and annihilation operators at each site of the system ( i.e.  @xmath49 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] , etc . ) , and adding a hopping term to the hamiltonian .",
    "the wave function , in this case , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the components of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 denotes the vacuum state with no reactants in the system .",
    "the formal solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) is @xmath56 is the initial wave function , and @xmath57 is the propagator of the system for time @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 @xmath60 being the time ordering operator .",
    "this solution of @xmath61 , as function of the time , fully characterize the behavior of the system .",
    "notice , however , that the interpretation of the wave function differs from that of quantum mechanics . here",
    "it represents probability and not probability amplitude .",
    "in particular , the expectation value of an operator , @xmath62 , in a state defined by @xmath61 is given by the matrix element @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an eigenstate of the annihilation operators , i.e. @xmath65    in understanding the structure of this nonequilibrium theory , it is instructive to consider specific examples of expectation values .",
    "consider , first , the expectation value of the identity operator @xmath66 . using the identity @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a general function of the creation and annihilation operators , one can easily see that @xmath69 . since the sum of probabilities over all possible occupation configurations equals unity , we obtain @xmath70 . thus the normalization of the wave function reads @xmath71 .",
    "the conservation of probability implies that @xmath71 holds for any time @xmath58 , therefore @xmath72 this equation is satisfied only if @xmath73 .",
    "thus , a legitimate hamiltonian of our theory must vanish when setting all the creation operators to one .",
    "for example , the lotka ",
    "volterra hamiltonian should satisfy @xmath74 it is easy to verify that ( [ ha ] ) and ( [ hlv ] ) , indeed , satisfy this condition .    as a second example , let us calculate the mean number of predator at site @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "notice that , unlike quantum mechanics where the expectation value of an annihilation operator vanish , here ( [ cs ] ) implies that @xmath77 . substituting @xmath78 in ( [ aq ] ) and using ( [ oi ] ) we obtain @xmath79 where @xmath52 is the number of prey at site @xmath75 .",
    "in order to construct the propagator , @xmath57 , it is convenient to employ the path integral formalism . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the propagator of binary annihilation in the zero dimension .",
    "we define a coherent state of the system as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a complex number .",
    "the matrix element of a normal ordered operator @xmath68 , where all creation operators stand left to annihilation operators , is given by @xmath82 in particular , the inner product of coherent states is @xmath83 , and the normalization condition @xmath84 is satisfied .",
    "the resolution of identity associated with coherent states is @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "consider the expectation value of a general operator @xmath87 at time @xmath58 , @xmath88 where operators are assumed to be normal ordered .",
    "for simplicity we choose an initial state , @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , thus @xmath91 .",
    "since we are interested in properties which are independent of the precise form of the initial condition , this particular choice does not have an important effect .",

    "now , we insert @xmath95 identity operators ( [ roi ] ) between the various terms of the above product . using ( [ afa ] ) and taking the continuum limit , @xmath96 , we obtain the expectation value @xmath97 in the form of a path integral @xmath98 e^{-f_0}~ q(1 , a(t ) )    e^{-|a(0)|^2 + a^*(0 ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the action of the system @xmath100\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath101 = \\prod_\\tau [ d^2 a(\\tau)/\\pi]$ ] is the measure of the integral .    having the path integral expression for the propagator , the generalization to the finite dimensional case is straightforward .",
    "it merely amount for the addition of a diffusive term in the action .",
    "thus the action of the diffusion - reaction process ( [ aa ] ) is @xmath102\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , now , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are functions of the time @xmath105 as well as the space coordinates @xmath106 . henceforth we omit the explicit time and space dependence of the fields .",
    "the action associated with the lotka - volterra process ( [ lvp ] ) can be derived in the same way , and the result is : @xmath107 where @xmath108    finally we remark that , unlike quantum mechanics of many - body bosons where fields are periodic in imaginary time , here there are no such boundary conditions .",
    "the mean field equations of the field theory defined by the action ( [ action ] ) are the saddle point equations of the bare action , @xmath109 where the functional derivative is with respect to all the fields , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . seeking for a solution with non vanishing densities @xmath112 , @xmath113 , the saddle fields ( which we denote by bar ) are @xmath114 , and solutions of the equations @xmath115 thus the mean filed equations of the quantized lotka - volterra system are precisely the lotka - volterra equations ( [ lve ] ) .",
    "the steady state solutions of ( [ lve ] ) , @xmath116 , admit only homogeneous densities in space @xcite .",
    "they are associated with the fixed - points of the equations : one is the unstable hyperbolic fixed - point , @xmath117 , corresponding to the case with no reactants in the system .",
    "the second , @xmath118 , represents the situation where the number of prey grows indefinitely in the absence of predator .",
    "the third fixed - point , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , is an elliptic fixed - point corresponding to a balanced ecological state with fixed populations .",
    "linearizing equations ( [ lve ] ) around the latter fixed - point we obtain : @xmath121 where @xmath122 @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the matrix @xmath125 , which we shall call the bare mass matrix , is the generator of time evolution of homogeneous densities in the vicinity of the fixed - point .",
    "its eigenvalues determine the stability properties of the fixed - point . if the real parts of the eigenvalues are positive , the fixed - point is stable , while if negative , it is unstable . in our case ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath125 are purely imaginary , @xmath126 .",
    "it implies that close enough to the fixed - point the population densities oscillate in time .",
    "moreover , a nonlinear stability analysis of the lotka - volterra equations shows that the system exhibits periodic evolution over the whole phase space .",
    "the reason is the existence of a conserved quantity@xcite ( for homogeneous densities ) , @xmath127 which confines the phase space trajectories to move along concentric closed loops , as shown in fig .",
    "[ loops ] .",
    "= 7.7 cm    = 7.7 cm    [ simulations ]    notice that elliptic fixed - points are unstable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "any small perturbation might shift the eigenvalues @xmath128 off the imaginary axis .",
    "consequently the elliptic fixed - point will become either a stable or an unstable focus . in what follows",
    "it will be shown that discretization effects , which lie beyond the mean field description , indeed , lead to such a scenario .",
    "an effective action of a field theory is obtained by integrating out the `` fast '' degrees of freedom .",
    "the procedure is usual : first , we separate the fields into `` fast '' and `` slow '' components .",
    "say for the annihilation process ( [ aa ] ) , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 denote fourier components of the field which oscillate rapidly or slowly in space , respectively .",
    "next , we expand the action @xmath132 $ ] up to second order in the fast fields : @xmath133 + f_2[a_{s } , a^*_{s } ; a_{f},a^*_{f}]$ ] , where @xmath134 is quadratic in the fast fields @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    ". then the effective action , @xmath137 $ ] , is obtained by integrating out the fast fields , @xmath138   e^{-f[a_{s } , a^*_{s } ] - f_2[a_{s } , a^*_{s } , a_{f},a^*_{f } ] } .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the binary annihilation reaction , the effective action has been calculated by cardy and tauber @xcite . from this calculation",
    "they prove that , for @xmath17 , the mean field equations hold , and the density of reactants decreases as @xmath139 .",
    "however , when @xmath140 , inherent spatial fluctuations result in a decrease of the asymptotic annihilation rate , @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that in the binary annihilation example the fixed - point @xmath142 does not change due to discretization effects . only the asymptotic approach to this point alters . as we shall see , in the lotka - volterra system the renormalization procedure results in a more dramatic effect .",
    "the nature of the fix - point itself changes . to put it differently , if one associates the long time asymptotic behavior of the system with the ground state of the field theory defined by the action ( [ action ] ) , then quantization leads to a new ground state which differ from the `` classical '' ground state described by the lotka - volterra equations ( [ lve ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we consider only the physical situation of the critical dimension , @xmath18 , and defer the technical details of the derivation of the effective action of the lotka - volterra system to the appendix .",
    "given the fixed - point of the lotka - volterra equations ( [ lve ] ) at finite densities , @xmath143 , it is convenient to change variables to fields which represent fluctuations around this fixed - point , namely , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 . the bare green function , @xmath146 , associated with the quadratic part of the resulting action is , @xmath147^{-1 } , \\label{g0}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 is the identity matrix , and @xmath125 is the bare mass matrix ( [ m0 ] ) .",
    "dyson s equation for the exact green function , @xmath149 , is , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the self energy .",
    "the correction for the mass matrix is the zero fourier components of the self energy , @xmath152 , thus @xmath153 .",
    "the stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of the renormalized mass matrix , which are @xmath154 renormalization , in the first approximation , only shifts @xmath155 from its zero mean field value .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of the mass matrix are approximately @xmath156 , where @xmath157 in deriving this result ( see appendix ) we have assumed @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and low densities of the reactants .",
    "@xmath161 is the upper momentum cutoff .",
    "> from this result it follows that the fixed point becomes an unstable focus .",
    "this is verified by numerical simulations shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ simulations ] .",
    "it is natural inquire about the nature of the new ground state of the system .",
    "what is the global behavior of trajectories in phase space when the fixed - point is an unstable focus ?",
    "there are two sensible scenarios : ( a ) one of the other mean field fixed - points , @xmath162 or @xmath163 , becomes stable due discretization , and all the trajectories converge to this point .",
    "( b ) some other type of attractive manifold , such as a limit cycle , if formed . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ simulations ] we present numerical results of simulations where we set the initial conditions to be far from the fixed point .",
    "the converging behavior of the trajectories indicates that the second scenario takes place , and the long time asymptotics of the system is that of a limit cycle .",
    "we have shown that the discreteness of the reactants in lotka - volterra systems , in two dimensions , results in a behavior ( figs .  [ simulations ] ) which differs from that of the lotka - volterra equations ( fig .",
    "[ loops ] ) . our analytical analysis and numerical simulations ( fig .  [ simulations ] ) indicate that the instability of the lotka - volterra equations signals the formation of a new ground state where an attractive manifold similar to a limit cycle is formed .",
    "further studies on this subject will be focused on the nature of the unstable phase , and the behavior of the system in one dimension .",
    "in this appendix we provide some details of the summation of the one loop diagrams for the lotka volterra system .",
    "our discussion will be limited to properties of the system near the fixed - point .",
    "it is therefore convenient to change variables to fields which describe fluctuations around this fixed - point . thus changing variables as @xmath144 , @xmath145 ,",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) takes the form @xmath164 where @xmath165    to construct the quadratic part of the action in the fast variables , @xmath134 , it is convenient to represent the fields in terms of their fourier components , e.g. @xmath166 .",
    "now , we define a vector of fast variables @xmath167 , where the fast fields contain terms only with high values of the momentum @xmath168 . thus : @xmath169 where elements of the matrix @xmath170 are functions of the slow fields ( henceforth we drop the subscript @xmath171 of these fields ) , and : @xmath172 where the bilinear reaction terms have been incorporated into the propagator .",
    "the effective mean field equations are obtained from the effective action by differentiating with respect to the fields @xmath176 and @xmath111 .",
    "this differentiation yields the new equations of motion ( @xmath177 ) : @xmath178 here the trace should be understood as a summation both over the indices of the matrices and an over @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the latter summation is logarithmically divergent , signaling that the long time asymptotics of the system is different from the mean field equations . in the leading approximation we cut off this divergence at the point where the perturbation expansion breaks down , namely @xmath181 . in this approximation",
    "the location of the new fixed - point is shifted to : @xmath182 where @xmath161 is the upper momentum cutoff .",
    "here we assume @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and low densities of the reactants , namely @xmath183 .",
    "next , in order to calculate the mass matrix , we expand the equations of motion ( [ corrections ] ) to second order in @xmath81 and @xmath184 and to first order in @xmath185 .",
    "the resulting equations are linearized around the new fixed point ( [ newfixed ] ) , and the corresponding mass matrix is calculated .",
    "the result for the trace of the mass matrix is given in ( [ newtrace ] ) .",
