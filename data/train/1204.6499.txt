    "the falicov  kimball model ( fkm)@xcite was introduced more than forty years ago with an objective to describe metal - insulator transitions and mixed - valence phenomena in certain hexaborides and oxides .",
    "it attracted an impressive amount of work within both solid state theory@xcite and mathematical physics@xcite , dealing with all aspects of the ground state properties and the phase diagram .",
    "early on , various extensions of the original model were proposed@xcite in order to more adequately describe the physics and/or phenomenology of specific systems . in recent years , much attention has been paid to the possibility of _ electronic ferroelectricity _ in an appropriately extended falicov  kimball model ( efkm)@xcite . this phenomenon is intimately related to the notion of excitonic insulator , which was introduced earlier in a somewhat different context@xcite ( see also refs . ) . finding an actual electronic ferroelectric might be important technologically , and the experimental search is ongoing@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested that the efkm might be relevant for some systems of current interest , including manganates@xcite and @xmath0@xcite .",
    "various approximate methods@xcite ( as well as numerical techniques@xcite ) were used to determine the phase diagrams of both pure and extended fkm and the carrier spectral properties in the ground state .",
    "yet it appears that the present article reports the first systematic study of the low - energy collective excitations in the excitonic insulator ( or excitonic condensate ) state of the efkm . even though restricted by the hartree ",
    "fock mean field approach , the results shed light on the nature of much discussed instability of the excitonic state in the limit of pure fkm . in the case of efkm , we obtain the excitation spectra in the excitonic state , and thereby identify the underlying energy scales .",
    "importantly , this also allows to probe the mean - field stability of the uniform excitonic insulator .",
    "until now , this latter issue has been addressed only variationally , by considering a finite set of competing mean field ground states .    the spinless falicov ",
    "kimball model proper involves fermions @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the localised and itinerant bands , interacting via a coulomb repulsion @xmath3 on - site : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bare energy of the localised band .",
    "we choose the units where the hopping amplitude @xmath6 and the period @xmath7 of the ( @xmath8-dimensional hypercubic ) lattice are equal to unity .",
    "presently , we consider the half - filled ( @xmath9 ) case at zero temperature . historically , the _ raison dtre _ of the falicov  kimball model is the presence of an intermediate valence regime , whereby the two original bands are partially filled .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that within a broad range of parameter values in this regime , the lowest - energy spatially uniform mean - field solution is characterised by an interaction - induced spontaneous hybridisation , @xmath10 .",
    "hartree - fock decoupling of the equations of motion for the green s functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 yields @xmath13 for the hybridisation and @xmath14 for the localised - band occupancy @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the number of the lattice sites and @xmath17 with the renormalised relative energy of the localised band , @xmath18 , and the tight - binding dispersion , @xmath19 .",
    "this mean - field solution has its filled and empty quasiparticle bands separated by a hybridisation gap of @xmath20 , corresponding to an excitonic insulator .",
    "if the two original bands have opposite parity and @xmath21 , it has a spontaneous dipole moment ( electronic ferroelectricity)@xcite .",
    "however , the uniform excitonic insulator state in the pure fkm is unstable@xcite , which has largely been attributed@xcite to fluctuations due to the local continuous degeneracy .",
    "the latter , in turn , is associated with the phase of each of the operators @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fkm ] ) , and hence with the phase of @xmath22 on - site .    this strong degeneracy can be broken , and the stability of the excitonic insulator may eventually be restored , by any of the terms in the perturbation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath8-band hopping and @xmath25 , bare on - site hybridisation .",
    "@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the spatially - even ( odd ) nearest - neighbour hybridisation , as appropriate for the case where the two original bands have the same ( opposite ) parity .",
    "@xmath28 is the radius - vector of a site @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , sum of cartesian unit vectors . when the falicov  kimball model is _ extended _ by eq.([eq : pert ] ) , it ceases to be exactly soluble .",
    "identifying its ground states and constructing the phase diagram constitute the subject of a broad on - going research effort@xcite . in the present article",
    ", we address the issue of stability of the excitonic insulating state with a uniform real @xmath31 , and its low - energy properties at the mean - field level ( ignoring higher - order correlations ) .",
    "we consider the particle - hole excitations of the excitonic insulator state , which in general are given by @xmath32 where the four quantities @xmath33 are arbitrary functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
