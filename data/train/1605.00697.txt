    "they are also , in fact , coefficients in the q - series of a mock modular form .",
    "the role of @xmath152 remained mysterious ; it is not a symmetry of any k3 conformal field theory .    with that bit of review , we are ready to venture onward .    starting with cheng ,",
    "soon after the work of eguchi - ooguri - tachikawa , various groups began to try to precisely define the predictions of mathieu moonshine by studying ` twined ' elliptic genera ( genera with an insertion of a symmetry transformation in the trace ) [ ] .",

    "this both allows them to satisfy the even self - dual condition , and breaks some of the naive symmetry .",
    "for instance , importantly , the @xmath199 theory does not have @xmath155 permutation symmetry , but instead enjoys only an @xmath152 symmetry .",
    "the umbral moonshine conjectures of cheng - duncan - harvey amount to the statement that there is a moonshine relating the niemeier lattices and their associated symmetry groups @xmath154 , to a vector - valued mock modular form .",

    "the papers [ ] specify the mock modular form by giving a recipe in terms of the root system of the umbral group to specify the shadow ; imposing the existence of a pole of order @xmath201 at @xmath62 , with regular behavior at other cusps for the twined functions ; and specifying a slow - growth condition on the coefficients of the mock modular forms .",

    "as you ve likely heard , there are several different types of supersymmetric string theory .",
    "heterotic strings begin life in 10d with gauge groups ( @xmath89 or @xmath90 ) and half maximal supersymmetry .",
    "type iia and type iib string theory begin life with less gauge symmetry but more supersymmetry .",
    "these theories are related by dualities in lower dimensions ; for instance the heterotic string on @xmath205 is equivalent to type iia on @xmath106 , with ( non - abelian ) gauge groups on one side manifested in a - d - e singularities of the other side .",
    "string duality is a large subject .",
    "a nice general introduction is [ ] , while a detailed discussion with more focus on k3 surfaces in string duality appears in [ ] .",
    "let us now go on an apparent digression . consider the heterotic string compactification to 3d on @xmath206 .",
    "the moduli space of such models was discussed by sen in 1994 [ ] ( building on earlier work of [ ] ) .",
    "it is @xmath207    this is interesting .",
    "it is 192 dimensional .",
    "naively , the moduli space would be 162 dimensional :    one gets 112 scalars in the 3d low energy theory from @xmath90 wilson lines .",
    "the internal components of the flat metric on @xmath206 show up as kaluza - klein scalars in 3d .",

    "the heterotic string also has an antisymmetric two - form tensor field , @xmath208 .",
    "there are 21 b - field components on @xmath206 which give rise to scalars in 3d .",
    "finally , as with any string theory , there is the scalar which controls the string coupling  the dilaton .",
    "however , in 3d one has a duality also between ( abelian ) gauge fields and scalars . at generic points in moduli space ,",
    "the gauge group is @xmath209 ( 16 factors from the @xmath90 or @xmath89 on its coulomb branch ; seven kk gauge fields from the metric ; and 7 kk gauge fields from the b - field ) .",
    "dualizing @xmath210 gives us 30 additional scalars @xmath211 .",

    "the additional elements enlarging this to @xmath213 morally come from * s - dualities * visible already in four dimensions .",
    "why are we taking this detour to three dimensions ?",
    "because in the 3d string theory , niemeier lattices and their umbral symmetry groups play a preferred role in the physics [ ] .",
    "notice that @xmath214 can be viewed as the moduli space of even unimodular lattices of signature ( 24,8 ) .",
    "there are 24 special points in the moduli space where the lattice splits as @xmath215 @xmath216 must be the @xmath88 root lattice , but @xmath217 can be the leech lattice or any of the 23 niemeier lattices .",
    "note that all of these  niemeier points \" in moduli space are non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "they can not be seen perturbatively in any duality frame in 3d .",
    "the theory at the niemeier points has enhanced @xmath218 gauge symmetry . a small perturbation breaks the symmetry around any such point to @xmath209 while preserving the umbral symmetry group @xmath154 associated to the relevant niemeier lattice .",
    "the umbral groups can be seen perturbatively in the heterotic theory both in 3d and ( even more obviously ) in 2d .",
    "this gives a good way to think of the umbral symmetries in @xmath106 .",
    "heterotic string theory on @xmath206 is dual to type ii string theory on @xmath219 .",
    "the picture you should keep in mind is shown in figure 3 .",
    "[ umbral ]    .,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    one can obtain 6d theories on k3 by decompactifying a @xmath220 .",
    "this requires a choice of a 4-plane in the @xmath221 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings ( from many perspectives ) that symmetries of k3 sigma models correspond to * 4-plane * preserving subgroups of @xmath157 .",
    "symmetries of the 6d theory which can be followed continuously from 3d starting from the vicinity of a niemeier point , should be associated with that umbral group and have twinings governed by the relevant umbral moonshine .",
    "we would now like to read off the spectrum and symmetry properties of the bps states .",
    "the basic strategy we will pursue is the following .",
    "after string duality , it is most natural to focus on physical quantities which appear in the space - time effective action  as these are duality invariant .",
    "so to discuss a bps spectrum , it is best to find a coupling function which is governed by bps states , and constrain its form . in theories with 8 supercharges , famously , functions like the gauge coupling function appearing in front of the maxwell terms in the lagrangian receive interesting quantum corrections [ ] . in theories like those under consideration here , with sixteen supercharges ,",
    "the situation is more constrained .",
    "the two - derivative effective lagrangian does not have interesting corrections .",
    "however , there are * four - derivative * terms that do receive interesting and computable corrections . very roughly , these are terms of the form @xmath222 and we are computing the function @xmath223 for some very special choices of the contractions of indices labelling the moduli .",
    "( the full story of these couplings can be found in the work of obers and pioline , see [ ] ) .",
    "some fully explicit computations of these four - derivative terms in @xmath224 , which are saturated by 1/2 bps states , can be found in [ ] .",
    "these exhibit e.g. a decomposition of the 1/2 bps states into @xmath152 irreps near the @xmath225 point in moduli space .    here",
    ", we just give a flavor of the results .",
    "specialize to a point in moduli space where @xmath226 with @xmath194 a positive definite , even unimodular 24 lattice",
    ". simply means that we consider the @xmath88 lattice with the normal quadratic form measuring norms flipped in sign . ] for any @xmath227 , we can consider a theta series @xmath228 this series will have cofficients governing the four - derivative correction as we move in moduli space along a direction determined ( infinitesimally ) by the choice of @xmath229 .",
    "you can understand this because the @xmath192 vector multiplets of the 3d @xmath230 supersymmetry each have scalars in them ( 8 after dualizing , to be precise ) , and the choice of @xmath229 is choosing a direction in the 24 dimensional space of vector multiplets .",
    "( which of the 8 scalar components in a given scalar in the 3d vectormultiplet that we pick , does nt matter much ) .",
    "it follows from standard facts about lattice theta functions that this will be a holomorphic jacobi form of weight @xmath231 and index @xmath232 the fourier coefficients are @xmath233    the choice of @xmath229 breaks the group @xmath234 down to @xmath235 which fixes @xmath194 .",
    "recall that for a given instance of umbral moonshine , @xmath236 with @xmath237 the relevant weyl group and @xmath154 the umbral group .",
    "there exist choices of @xmath229 ( proportional to a weyl vector ) that result in @xmath238 .    for the niemeier lattice @xmath225 with @xmath229 equal to a weyl vector",
    ", we find @xmath239 to be of weight 12 and index 6 .",
    "one can present a fully explicit expression for it in terms of basis jacobi forms [ ] .",
    "the @xmath152 representations appearing in low lying terms in the ( q , y ) expansion are @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 @xmath243    it remains a very interesting challenge to find a physical role for the umbral mock modular forms in the 3d picture .",
    "it is likely that this will come from a deeper understanding of 1/4 bps states .",
    "it would also be very interesting to give a precise connection between the association of umbral symmetries with k3 surfaces following from this picture , and the theory of niemeier markings .",
    "finally , it is important to mention that while my own focus on manifesting the symmetries of the problem has led me to emphasize a possible role for 3d string vacua in explaining umbral moonshine , from other perspectives , other limits of the theory could play roles of equal or greater importance in our eventual understanding .",
    "in the next two lectures , we move on to some connections of the ideas we ve developed to other areas of theoretical physics . here , we focus on some ( possibly coincidental ) connections between the cfts involved in moonshine , and theories that could be related to ads3 quantum gravity . we begin with a number of disclaimers :    there are various good reasons to be skeptical that weakly curved ads3 quantum gravity ( with no matter fields ) exists .",
    "see the discussion in [ ] .",
    "there are reasons to think that perhaps the conditions espoused here to define  pure quantum gravity , \" could or should be modified .",
    "see e.g. the very recent [ ] for one proposed modification .",
    "we will blithely ignore these complications and proceed .",
    "the ideas are interesting enough to justify hearing about them once .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence was famously derived by taking a near - horizon limit , using  real d - branes \" in string theory [ ] .",
    "but we can abstract the basic facts of the duality , without a particular d - brane construction in mind .",
    "one of the most basic elements of the map takes the local ( scalar ) operators in the cft to local bulk fields in ads .",
    "the map for @xmath244 takes a local scalar operator of dimension @xmath163 , to a bulk field whose mass scales as @xmath245    there are many theories we might wish to study , that we do not ( yet ) know how to find via scaling limits of d - branes . but",
    "this does nt mean we ca nt study their possible ads / cft dualities .",
    "let us pick the simplest : * pure * gravity in ads3 .",
    "the main ingredient we will use is the map between bulk fields and boundary operators , and what this tells us about the spectrum of a cft dual to pure gravity .      by pure gravity , we mean the theory with no bulk fields other than the multiplet dual to the stress tensor .",
    "we will therefore postulate a cft whose hilbert space contains nothing but the vacuum and its descendants .",
    "such a hypothetical cft wo nt be consistent , but lets see how far we can get .",
    "our discussion closely follows the ideas of [ ] .",
    "a universal fact about ads3/cft2 was discovered by brown and henneaux in 1986 [ ] .",
    "it is that @xmath246 where @xmath6 will be the central charge of the dual 2d cft , @xmath247 is the curvature radius of ads3 , and @xmath154 is the newton constant .",
    "it is important to stress that brown and henneaux comptued this @xmath6 not by knowing a dual 2d cft , but by thinking about commutators of symmetry generators visible purely in the gravitational theory .",
    "the virasoro symmetry shows up via symmetries visible at spatial infinity in the ads3 gravity theory , and @xmath6 can be computed a priori from commutators in the gravity side .",
    "importantly , c obtained in this way * does * match the central charge of the dual cft in existing dual pairs .",
    "now , a standard count of the number of physical polarizations after removing gauge redundancies reveals that there are no propagating gravitons in 3d gravity .",
    "but there are ads  boundary gravitons . \" these correspond to the descendants of the ads vacuum ( in the dual cft ) , with respect to the virasoro generators .",
    "i.e. , we can consider strings of virasoro operators acting on the @xmath70 invariant vacuum @xmath248 , @xmath249    the counting of the states will be as follows .",
    "@xmath250 annihilates the vacuum .",
    "but we could act with @xmath251 any number of times : @xmath252 this gives a tower of states that would contribute , to the torus partition function of a would - be dual cft , @xmath253 similarly , the @xmath254 ( with @xmath255 ) would yield a factor of @xmath256 in the torus partition function .",
    "so we find for the full contribution of the descendants , @xmath257    this is nt quite right yet , as we need to remember that the vacuum contribution is weighted with a @xmath258 in the partition sum , because of the casimir energy .",
    "for @xmath259 , this would give @xmath260 this is the would - be partition function of the cft dual to pure quantum gravity in ads3 , with cosmological constant @xmath261 .    a few comments :    @xmath1 the astute reader will note that i have assumed that the cft is chiral .",
    "there could be various justifications for this .",
    "one is that we could be looking for duals to ` chiral gravity ' [ ] .",
    "another is that there are indications from the chern - simons formulation of 3d gravity that the values @xmath259 are preferred , which allows for ( but does not guarantee ! ) holomorphic factorization [ ] . in any case",

    "these are * black holes * in ads , the btz black holes .",
    "while we know a lot about the spectrum of perturbative particles in a theory of gravity coupled to matter , we can be a bit more agnostic about our knowledge of the black holes .",
    "where do these things appear in the partition function ? after restoring factors of o(1 ) , it turns out that the terms @xmath265 in @xmath262 are the ones corresponding to perturbative particles . in a theory of pure gravity",
    ", we could reasonably require that the coefficients @xmath266 be determined by the virasoro descendants of @xmath248 .",

    "the ( chiral ) partition function is a modular function . on physical grounds ,",

    "recall that the general expansion of the elliptic genus looks like @xmath301 based on the spectral flow automorphism of the @xmath297 algebra [ ] @xmath302 @xmath303 the terms with @xmath304 are sufficient to determine the genus .",

    "the circles mark the integral points in the polar region , while the triangles do not give independent polar states.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the * polarity * is defined as @xmath308 it is called polarity because the terms with @xmath309 correspond to polar coefficients in the ordinary modular forms governing the theta series of a jacobi form . in the naive semiclassical map to gravity ,",
    "the terms with @xmath310 are black holes , while terms with @xmath311 correspond to supergravity states .",
    "the polarity is bounded below by @xmath312 , so this leaves a finite number of possible polar terms . for more discussion of the relationship with states at a positive polarity to black holes , see e.g. [ ] .",
    "now , finally , with the power of @xmath297 supersymmetry , we will be able to state an interesting general result .",
    "@xmath1 the number of polar coefficients , is @xmath313 at large @xmath128 .",
    "this is easily obtained by doing a precise count of integer points contained under the curve in figure 4 .",
    "@xmath1 the dimension of the space of weak jacobi forms at a given ( large ) @xmath128 is @xmath314 this can be obtained by using the explicit basis forms we described and enumerating .",

    "@xmath315    under the ( not unreasonable ) assumption that the polar coefficients induced from the vacuum character are somewhat typical , and do not lie in the lower - dimensional vector space characterizing true weak jacobi forms  by accident , \"",
    "we then expect that at sufficiently large @xmath128 , @xmath297 extremal theories do not exist !",
    "more rigorous reasoning suffices to verify this [ ] .",
    "again , the important caveat that one can modify the condition for polar coefficients at energies of @xmath316 but before the naive onset of ` black holes , ' needs to be emphasized . this could change the answer to the question of whether such theories exist .",
    "again , at low @xmath6 , such theories * do * exist . and",
    "again , they are relevant to moonshine ! see [ ] for discussions of pure @xmath297 theories at @xmath317 which enjoy a connection with moonshine for mathieu groups .",
    "we could also continue the discussion to further extended supersymmetry , and find examples at low central charge .",

    "in this final section , we close with one more  application \" of moonshine , this time in mathematics .",
    "we will describe some connections between a moonshine module  appearing in the conway moonshine discussed in lecture 4  and the enumerative geometry of k3 surfaces .",
    "we will see that the hierarchy of k3 invariants given by the yau - zaslow nodal curve counts [ ] , the kkv invariants [ ] including one further grading , and the kkp invariants [ ] including two further gradings , are all natural traces in this moonshine module .",
    "this is in accord with the fact  discussed in lectures 2,3  that all symmetries of k3 cfts can naturally be embedded in @xmath157 .",
    "counts of bps states in string theory have been useful in obtaining an understanding of black hole entropy ; in elucidating the behavior of soluble field theories which arise in decoupling limits of string compactification ; and in providing duality - invariant  tags \" of the theory , providing highly nontrivial consistency checks on various dualities .",
    "there is some hope that proper understanding of the bps states may also lead to a deeper understanding of the mathematics underlying string theory .    in the simple",
    "setting of heterotic or type iia compactifications ( on @xmath205 or @xmath106 , respectively ) with 16 supercharges , the 1/2 bps states can be counted following the logic of dabholkar and harvey [ ] .",
    "the heterotic string has all supersymmetries coming from the right movers , while the left - moving degrees of freedom are those of a @xmath276 bosonic string . to find bps states ,",
    "we therefore leave right - movers in a ground state , but freely excite the left - moving oscillator modes .",
    "the result is a 1/2 bps counting function        we can turn this into a more geometric statement in two ways . in the type iia string on k3 , which is dual to heterotic strings on @xmath205 , the bps states can be counted in one duality frame by studying bound states of @xmath35 d0-branes to a d4-brane [ ] .",
    "as the moduli space of a d0-brane on k3 is a copy of the space itself , this thinking leads to a count @xmath322 } ) q^{n-1}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath323}$ ] denotes the hilbert scheme of n points on @xmath106 ; it is a desingularization of the @xmath35th symmetric product of a k3 surface .",
    "in fact , gttsche has shown [ ] @xmath324 } ) q^{n-1}~,\\ ] ] and so this alternate count of bps states agrees with the heterotic string , as expected from string duality .",
    "an alternative geometrization arises in yet another duality frame . instead of counting @xmath35 d0-branes in a d4-brane",
    ", we can get a bps state with the same charges by considering a d2-brane wrapping a curve with self - intersection number @xmath325 .",
    "this can be realized on a holomorphic curve of genus @xmath35 in k3 .",
    "d2-branes come equipped with a @xmath123 gauge field , so the count is now governed by the euler character of the moduli space @xmath326 of holomorphic curves of genus @xmath35 with a choice of flat @xmath123 bundle [ ] .",
    "it was argued by yau and zaslow [ ] and proved in [ ] that the contribution to @xmath327 localizes on curves of genus 0 with @xmath35 double points .",
    "hence we get a yau - zaslow formula @xmath328 in this way , we relate a counting function of interest in enumerative geometry , to a bps state count governed by gttsche s formula , or by the heterotic string .      of course , there is more to the life of a bps state than simply its mass . for instance , in string compactification to 5d on @xmath329 , there is an @xmath330 little group in the non - compact dimensions .",
    "so we can imagine grading the count of bps states by the @xmath143 quantum numbers .",
    "let us work our way up in steps .",
    "returning to gttsche s formula , we can clearly further refine the euler character to the @xmath331 genus : @xmath332 with @xmath333 the hodge numbers .",

    "physically , it is a bps index counting the bps states of m2-branes wrapping a 2-cycle in homology class @xmath32 with spin quantum numbers @xmath353 under the @xmath354 little group mentioned above .",
    "the label @xmath35 arises through the conjecture of [ ] that for a k3 surface @xmath355 , @xmath352 depends only on @xmath356 for any @xmath357 .",
    "we ve now achieved an enumerative interpretation of the bps counting function with gradings corresponding to each of the @xmath143s .",
    "the kkv formula can clearly be interpreted as the specialization keeping account of a single @xmath143 grading .      in lecture 4",
    ", we encountered a simple chiral cft which enjoys moonshine for conway s largest sporadic group @xmath158 ( or really its double - cover , @xmath157 ) .",

    "the dimension of the twist - field which interpolates between the untwisted and twisted sectors of the orbifold is @xmath362 .",
    "this is the correct dimension for a supercharge , and there is in fact a @xmath157-invariant choice of spin-3/2 field whose opes closes on an @xmath285 superconformal algebra [ ] .",
    "the ramond sector of this theory has 24 ground states , transforming in the * 24 * irreducible representation of @xmath157 .",
    "it is actually possible to view this theory as furnishing a realization of further enhanced chiral algebras .",
    "this is a viewpoint explored in [ ] .",
    "the basic idea is that one can construct @xmath123 or @xmath143 currents out of the free fermions @xmath358 . with appropriate choices , these",
    "can then rotate the single supercharge of the @xmath285 superconformal theory to give additional supercharge(s ) filling out e.g. an @xmath297 or @xmath142 superconformal algebra .",
    "each choice of superalgebra gives rise to a moonshine connecting various mock modular forms ( which arise as twining functions ) , to a preferred finite group ( arising as a subgroup of @xmath157 which preserves suitable structure ) .. ] the various choices explored in [ ] are summarized in the table below . in each case , one obtains a global symmetry group @xmath154 as a subgroup of @xmath157 which fixes a @xmath17-plane in the @xmath159 .",
    "the new generators of the corresponding superalgebra are constructed out of @xmath17 of the 24 free fermions .",
    "it is natural to associate lattice geometries to each superalgebra , as the @xmath159 of @xmath157 is canonically associated to the leech lattice .",
    ".the extended superconformal algebras of the conway module , the global symmetry groups they preserve , and the natural objects these symmetry groups act on .",

    "but it is also true that the elliptic genus @xmath381 of a manifold @xmath2 , specializes to the @xmath331 genus : @xmath382 it follows that from the elliptic genus of k3 alone , using the dmvv formula and this specialization , we can recover the kkv formula ( and hence also the yau - zaslow counting formula , by further specialization ) .",
    "the kkv invariants are therefore natural observables in our moonshine module .    in fact , we can also recover the doubly - graded kkp invariants .",
    "in addition to the @xmath123 current @xmath375 , there is another natural @xmath123 we can write down after choosing @xmath364 and @xmath365 , namely @xmath383 then it is reasonable to compute @xmath384 with @xmath385 being twice the zero mode of @xmath386 .",
    "it is easy to see @xmath387    a nice fact about the genera @xmath388 and @xmath389 is that , as they are defined as traces in the moonshine module , they can naturally be twined by symmetries of the associated cft .",

    "for any such @xmath47 in a four - plane preserving subgroup of @xmath157 , we can define @xmath390 specialization to @xmath391 yields the twined @xmath388 .    as the k3 cft also enjoys symmetries under 4-plane preserving subgroups of @xmath157 , and we can simply identify @xmath388 with @xmath392 , it is natural to conjecture that the twined moonshine functions control also the twining genera of the k3 cft .",
    "this also applies to conjectural twined refined invariants of the k3 cft .",
    "precise conjectures to this effect  which are bit too involved to state here  appear in [ ] .",
    "the interplay of this story with the more detailed physical story involving 3d string theory , described in  3 , suggests that the @xmath157 module here is only relevant for twinings by symmetries of k3 that can be obtained by direct lift ( without symmetry breaking ) from the @xmath157 point in the moduli space of @xmath219 compactifications .",
    "it seems natural to mention at the close of this lecture that connections between moonshine , enumerative geometry of calabi - yau threefolds , and heterotic strings on @xmath393 have appeared in [ ] .",

    "<S> these notes provide an elementary ( and incomplete ) sketch of the objects and ideas involved in monstrous and umbral moonshine . </S>",
    "<S> they were the basis for a plenary lecture at the 18th international congress on mathematical physics , and for a lecture series at the centre international de recontres mathematiques school on  mathematics of string theory . \"    </S>",
    "<S> this series of lectures will cover aspects of the subject of `` moonshine , '' and also some related developments in theoretical physics . </S>",
    "<S> the subject is notable because it ties together  in an evidently deep way  widely disparate areas of modern mathematics and theoretical physics . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests the existence of an underlying unification of ideas that we are still missing . </S>",
    "<S> a beautiful elementary exposition of some of the same material covered here can be found in the popular book [ ] .    the rough plan is to discuss four sets of topics ( spread over 5 lectures ) :    \\1 </S>",
    "<S> . monstrous moonshine ( which was primarily developed c. 1979 - 1992 ; good references include [ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 . mathieu and umbral moonshine ( c. 2010 - , with primary references being [ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 . </S>",
    "<S> relations to quantum gravity in 3d ( c. 2007 - , with a nice first discussion in [ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> enumerative geometry of k3 surfaces and moonshine ( a topic under development now [ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the first two topics can be considered the basic content of moonshine , while the third and fourth concern the intersection of ideas developed in the study of moonshine with cognate areas in theoretical physics ( quantum gravity and enumerative geometry of calabi - yau manifolds , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth topic was included in the lecture at the icmp , but omitted due to constraints of time in the lectures presented in marseilles . </S>",
    "<S> we have included it here for completeness . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , originally , it was also intended to discuss a fifth inter - related subject  </S>",
    "<S> the use of modular forms associated to 2d cfts ( as partition functions or indices ) to provide general insight into which 2d cfts admit large radius ads3 gravity duals . however , this subject is thematically distant enough from the topics covered here that we have not attempted to discuss it .    </S>",
    "<S> the unifying theme of the lectures is the interplay between special symmetries , 2d cft , modular forms , geometry , and string theory . </S>"
