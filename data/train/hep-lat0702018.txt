    "the 3d 3-state potts model plays a role in our understanding of the properties of the deconfining phase transition and the structure of qcd .",
    "the high - temperature vacuum of qcd is characterized by ordered polyakov loops which behave similarly as spins in the low temperature phase of the 3d 3-state potts model .",
    "the polyakov loop serves as an order parameter of su(3 ) pure gauge theory with its symmetry determined by the @xmath6 center of the gauge group , and the phase transition is weakly first order .",
    "this maps naturally onto the order parameter ( magnetization ) of the 3d 3-state potts model @xcite . for this and other reasons",
    "a number of numerical studies of the model were performed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the multicanonical technique @xcite to calculate the properly normalized entropy all the way from @xmath7 to across the phase transition . besides this new result",
    "a number of additional estimates ( see the abstract ) , are obtained and compared with the literature .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_notation ] we introduce basic notation and observables of interest , in section [ sec_sim_res ] we present our simulations and conclusions are given in the final section [ sec_sum ] .",
    "we simulate the @xmath8 potts model with the energy function @xmath9 where the sum is over the nearest neighbors of a 3d cubic lattice of size @xmath0 .",
    "the spins @xmath10 of the system take the values @xmath11 .",
    "the factor of two and the term @xmath12 are introduced to match for @xmath13 with ising model conventions  @xcite .",
    "our simulations are carried out in a multicanonical ensemble @xcite , covering an inverse temperature range from @xmath14 ( infinite temperature ) to @xmath15 below the phase transition temperature . instead of relying on a recursion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the multicanonical parameters were extracted by finite size ( fs ) extrapolations from smaller to larger system , which is efficient when the fs behavior is controllable .",
    "frequent excursions into the disordered phase all the way to @xmath7 secure equilibration of the configurations around the transition and in the ordered phase .    by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    "the specific heat is @xmath16 we put @xmath17 in parenthesis , because the number 2 is later used as a superscript of @xmath17 .",
    "the energy density per site is defined by @xmath18 so that the latent heat is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energy endpoints of the high ( @xmath22 ) and low ( @xmath23 ) temperature phase at the transition temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the entropy density is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the free energy density .",
    "as the free energy is continuous at the phase transition the entropy gap across the phase transition is @xmath27 to determine the entropy and energy gaps from data on finite lattices we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and study the scaling of the specific heat maxima @xmath28 .",
    "the leading order coefficient @xmath29 of the fit @xmath30 is related to the latent heat by @xmath31 and using ( [ sgap ] ) gives @xmath32 the entropy densities in the disordered ( @xmath22 ) and ordered ( @xmath23 ) phase at the transition temperature are defined by @xmath33 calculation of the endpoints from monte carlo ( mc ) data faces some technical difficulties , which are overcome in section  [ subsec_entr ] .    in a mc simulation of the gibbs canonical ensemble the entropy of the system",
    "is only determined up to an additive constant , whereas in our multicanonical simulation this constant is determined by the known normalization at @xmath7 : @xmath34",
    "in table  [ tab_3dp3q ] we list the lattice sizes used , number of sweeps ( sequential updates of the lattice for which each spin is touched once ) performed with the multicanonical metropolis algorithm and the number of cycles @xmath35 the markov process performed during the production run , where @xmath36 is the effective energy - dependent @xmath17 of the multicanonical procedure .",
    "data are energy histograms , which are collected over the statistics given by the second number in the production statistics column ( sweeps ) of table  [ tab_3dp3q ] .",
    "this is repeated for 32 bins , the first number in this column .",
    "the data analysis relies on converting the bins into jackknife bins , which are then reweighted to canonical ensembles using the logarithmic coding of  @xcite .",
    "error bars are obtained by performing analysis calculations for each jackknife bin .",
