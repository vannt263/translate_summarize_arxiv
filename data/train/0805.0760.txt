    "moreover , the error in ( [ hlo ] ) is phenomenologically well controlled and may be improved by a factor of 2 or so if more experimental data on @xmath13 should appear @xcite .",

    "first of all , in the pion - pole contribution , which dominates the hadronic lbl part , we take into account the full kinematic dependence of the pion - photon form factors , including their dependence on the pion virtuality .",
    "the inclusion of this dependence diminishes the results for the contribution to @xmath5 by about 15% compared to the calculation with no dependence on the pion virtuality .",
    "importantly , our approach is consistent with the low - energy theorems and with the qcd constraints .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how the qcd constraint considered by melnikov and vainshtein @xcite is satisfied at high photon momenta within n@xmath15qm , with the crucial role of the box diagram .",

    "the error in ( [ lpim ] ) is due to the uncertainty of the parameter @xmath181 taken from the interval @xmath182 $ ] gev@xmath183 .",
    "however , the function ( [ gvmd ] ) depends on two kinematic variables instead of three required by ( [ pionpole ] ) .",
    "we test the effect of this approximation .",
    "namely , in ( [ mpigg ] ) we have removed the dependence on the pion virtuality and have taken the meson propagator in ( [ pionpole ] ) in the single - pole approximation @xmath184 . in the n@xmath15qm",
    "we obtain numerically for the parameter set ( [ param1 ] ) @xmath185 this result should be compared to the full calculation yielding ( [ resu1 ] ) .",
    "thus , as already stated , the inclusion of the dependence on the pion virtuality reduces the result by about 15% . a similar statement that the influence of the pion off - shellness has only a small effect",
    "was presented in @xcite . in",
    "that work different form factors , including the point - like pion coupling and the form factors used in the extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( enjl ) model of @xcite , were tested .",
    "the stability of the results was demonstrated .",
    "recently , there was an attempt by jegerlehner and nyffeler @xcite to improve the kn model by taking into account the full kinematic dependence of the pion - photon vertex through the use of the parametrization for @xmath186 suggested in @xcite .",
    "this yields for the sum of the @xmath187 contributions @xmath188 . as a result",
    "an enhancement of the contribution in comparison with kn result @xmath189 was obtained .",
    "we believe that this is a result of neglecting the dressing effects in the parametrization constructed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , this parametrization reproduces the short - distance behavior of the three - point correlator of the pseudoscalar and vector currents @xcite . for these currents the local @xmath190 and @xmath191 couplings",
    "were used , correspondingly . because of the local character of these vertices the correlator has a slow power - like behaviour at large momenta . however",
    ", this correlator does not correspond to the triangle quark diagram connecting the virtual pion with the photons .",
    "the pion has its own hadronic form factor , which means that the @xmath190 vertex is dressed , as it corresponds to the nonlocal form factor ( [ pivertex ] ) ( see the similar results in the schwinger - dyson approach @xcite ) . as a result",
    "the large - momentum properties of the calculation change drastically .",
    "similar problems are encountered in calculations based on the usage of the constant constituent quark mass ( the local models ) @xcite . typically , these models predict larger numbers for the hadronic contribution due to incorrect form factors , artificially enhanced with respect to the ope asymptotics .",
    "we have to note that our approach is closest to the formalism of the work @xcite ( enjl model ) in the sense of the use of techniques of the effective models .",
    "however , the physical grounds are quite different .",
    "the enjl model is in fact a generalization of the vector meson dominance model , while n@xmath15qm is based on the fundamental property of the qcd vacuum , namely the nonlocality of the vacuum fluctuations of the gluon field .",
    "unfortunately , the region of applicability of the enjl model is restricted to momenta much lower than 1  gev .",
    "for example , we are not able to prove the properties of the triangle diagram ( [ tt]-[was ] ) by using the @xmath18 functions found in the enjl model @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency of the adler function found within enjl with the ope was noted earlier in @xcite .",
    "the high - momentum region was then modeled in @xcite by different parameterizations , which may be quite risky .",
    "one of us ( ad ) has already pointed out in @xcite that a possible reason for the failure of enjl at large momenta is due to the fact that this model is based on the single resonance approximation , while nonlocalities , inherent in n@xmath15qm , effectively take into account an infinite number of resonances according to the quark - hadron duality principle .",
    "one of the results that is observed in @xcite is that there are large cancellations of different contributions .",
    "this might be a model - dependent statement that has to be checked in future _ complete _ calculations within the nonlocal chiral quark model with instanton - like interactions .",
    "the sole contribution of the pion pole discussed in the previous sections and also used in @xcite and @xcite does not satisfy the melnikov - vainshtein ( mv ) asymptotics ( [ mvope ] ) discussed in sect .",

    "the effective quark propagator connecting the hard photon vertices ( @xmath191 ) becomes the usual massless quark propagator .",
    "thus , the asymptotics of the quark box diagram ( fig .",
    "3a ) is the same as in n@xmath15qm as well as in perturbative qcd for the massless quark considered in @xcite . in the enjl model",

    "6 )  finally , we agree with @xcite that in the mv model numerically one obtains @xmath217 instead of @xmath218 quoted originally in @xcite .",
    "presumably , the discrepancy has its origin in the numerical treatment of the large - momentum tails in the integrals . with the conformal variables , we treat these tails exactly .",
    "while the inclusion of the box diagram is crucial for the consistency of the n@xmath15qm , the numerical evaluation of its contribution to lbl is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we remark , that in the enjl model @xcite the result is @xmath219 , hence is a few times smaller than the dominant pion pole term .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the leading pion - pole contribution to @xmath220 in the nonlocal chiral quark model .",
    "the basic new element of our work is the inclusion of the full kinematic dependence of the pion - photon transition form factors , as it follows from the nonlocal chiral quark model .",
    "the dependence of the form factors on the pion virtuality decreases the result by about 15% compared to the case where this dependence is neglected .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the melnikov - vainshtein constraints , necessary for the consistency of the approach with qcd , are satisfied within the model when the quark box diagram is incorporated .",
    "numerically , we quantitatively confirm the results obtained in other effective quark models .",
    "an important next step in the investigations of the light - by - light scattering within nonlocal quark model is to perform an extension to the so - called _ complete _ calculation ( see @xcite ) , whch includes the scalar , axial - vector , and the @xmath221 meson exchanges , as well as takes into account the quark and meson box diagrams . due to contact terms arising in the nonlocal model ,",
