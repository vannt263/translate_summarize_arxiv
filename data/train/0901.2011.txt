    "density - functional theory ( dft ) has become over the years one of the most powerful theories for the description of complex electronic systems ranging from atoms and molecules , to bulk solids .",
    "it allows realistic calculations of an ever increasing number of systems in physics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "as the exact functional is not known , most applications employ the local density approximation ( lda ) , see e.g. @xcite , or its extension to the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite . in spite of their successes",
    ", these approaches still have deficiencies .",
    "in particular , the self - interaction error spoils single - particle properties as , e.g. , the ionization potential @xcite .",
    "another critical detail where lda and gga usually fail is the polarizability in chain molecules @xcite .",
    "an intuitive and efficient solution is to augment lda by a self - interaction correction ( sic ) @xcite , i.e. to introduce an explicit orbital dependence of the functional by subtracting by hand the spurious self - interaction .",
    "the drawback is that it produces a state - dependent mean - field hamiltonian which requires extra efforts to enforce orthogonality of the single particle basis @xcite .",
    "the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method @xcite overcomes that complication as it allows to define the best common ( state - independent ) local mean - field potential @xmath2 .",
    "indeed some crucial features of the underlying sic as , e.g. , the localization of states or the derivative discontinuity @xcite are found to be maintained through an oep procedure  @xcite , for a comprehensive overview see @xcite .",
    "but the exhaustive sic - oep equations are difficult to handle and are thus often simplified .",
    "a most popular approximation is the so - called krieger - li - iafrate ( sic - kli ) approach @xcite and , in a further step of simplification , the sic - slater approximation @xcite .",
    "however , sic - kli and sic - slater approximations can easily miss crucial features of sic as , e.g. , the performance with respect to polarizability , even if accurate exchange - correlation potentials are used @xcite ( note that the same conclusion holds at the exact - exchange level @xcite ) .",
    "a key question is the localization of orbitals , as had been already observed rather early @xcite , which then minimizes the electronic interaction energy .",
    "indeed states which optimize sic tend to be localized whereas states emerging from a common local mean - field tend to more delocalization .",
    "these contradicting demands can be bridged by full oep but spoil approximate treatments as sic - kli or sic - slater approximation .",
    "a fairly convenient way out is to use two sets of orbitals .",
    "that was already proposed in @xcite and has been used to improve on the sic - kli approximation @xcite , although not yet in a fully consistent and variational form .",
    "taking up the double - set idea , we have recently proposed a sic - oep scheme relying on two sets of complementing orbitals @xcite . at the purely stationary full sic level , it is mostly a matter of convenience , while a double - set technique becomes crucial in practical applications of the time - dependent sic @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will also demonstrate that this method can be powerfully exploited in stationary calculations in the frame of sic - oep .",
    "indeed the two sets are connected by a unitary transformation , thus building the same total density .",
    "one of the sets remains spatially localized while the other set is free to accommodate a common local potential and/or minimal energy variance .",
    "the spatially localized set is determined by variation of the sic energy with respect to unitary transformation coefficients which allows that these states fulfill what is called the `` symmetry condition '' @xcite .",
    "the localized set shows a much better performance with respect to standard sic - kli or sic - slater approximation .",
    "the resulting formalism is called `` generalized sic - oep '' @xcite .",
    "we further simplified the resulting equations , following the track of the sic - slater approximation and developed in a strictly variational manner a double - set treatment of the sic - slater approximation to oep , namely the `` generalized sic - slater '' approximation .",
    "it is to be noted that a very similar development is found in @xcite .",
    "as one of the sets remains spatially localized , it validates the generalized sic - slater approximation to generalized sic - oep built from this set , while maintaining key features of the full sic scheme : it is energetically advantageous for the sic energy , permits to re - establish potential energy surfaces ( pes ) , and performs fairly well in the calculations of polarizabilities .",
    "we pointed out that the generalized sic - slater emerges naturally because of the localization of one set of orbitals @xcite , whereas krzdrfer _",
    "@xcite compared generalized sic - kli and full generalized sic - oep with standard sic - kli and oep and also with the approximate generalized sic - kli of @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the practical introduction of localized orbitals within the sic - kli approximation has also been proposed in @xcite without explicit `` symmetry condition '' .",
    "the form of the sic - kli approximation used in those papers is not exactly what comes out from the more fundamental `` generalized sic - oep '' @xcite . after a brief presentation of the formalism",
    ", we apply it to model hydrogen chains , and to various other systems such as c ( organic ) chains and na ( metallic ) clusters .",
    "we briefly summarize the formalism using for simplicity a notation without explicit spin densities .",
    "the generalization to these is obvious .",

    "the justification of the approximation @xmath40 remains to be clarified . a way to circumvent",
    "the formal difficulty is to consider practical applications to see how the approximation performs .",
    "still , the assumption probably holds for spatially symmetric systems , as will be discussed lengthly when tested on hydrogen chains ( see sec .",

    "linear chains of h atoms constitute ( highly ) simplified model systems for various important chain or chain - like molecules such as in particular poly - acetylene with its remarkable properties @xcite .",

    "they thus provide a critical test .",
    "our calculations on polarizabilities in hydrogen chains are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : polh ] and are compared with previous results @xcite .",

    "bottom : transverse polarizabilities of h chains ( our own results only ) . ]    for sake of a fair comparison , we have taken care of using the same pseudopotential as used in former calculations because we found that using different pseudopotentials leads to different absolute values of the highly sensitive polarizabilities .",
    "this point may look surprising especially in the case of hydrogen for which inserting a pseudopotential is a matter of practical convenience for regularizing grid representations .",
    "however , as the grid size is optimized to the regularizing core , different core widths lead to slightly different finite representations of the wave functions ( having of course the same energy ) .",
    "this may deliver slighly different values of polarizabilities .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when comparing with mp4 results which are computed in a different fashion .",
    "but the comparison between the various dft approaches stays on safe grounds .",
    "we first mention that our lda and sic calculations perfectly match previously published results @xcite ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "furthermore the trends are rather systematic : lda strongly overestimates polarizabilities , as expected , and sic comes much closer to mp4 results . still the most relevant comparison , in our opinion ,",
    "is that between sic and approximations thereof , because of the pseudopotential effects mentioned above .",
    "there are several interesting points showing up from this comparison .",
    "first , while standard sic - slater ( open circles ) and standard sic - kli ( full circles ) calculations lead to results of varying quality , we see that gslat ( open squares ) , even if not perfectly matching exact sic , leads to overall acceptable results showing more regular and realistic trends .",
    "however the agreement in absolute values tends to degrade with increasing chain length , in relative values ( of gslat compared to sic ) : from + 8@xmath52 to + 25@xmath52 from h@xmath0 to h@xmath53 .",
    "hence one can wonder whether less dramatic approximations to the generalized sic - oep formalism would improve the results .",
    "an obvious next step is to use the generalized sic - kli correction instead of gslat .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : polh ] the loc .",
    "sic - kli results obtained by @xcite with the addition of the approximate generalized sic - kli term as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_oep5 ] ) .",
    "mind that these results used another localization criterion than the symmetry condition . as seen in the figure , perfect agreement with sic",
    "is achieved ( compare large open triangles with black diamonds ) .",
    "this thus validates _ a posteriori _ the assumption done to obtain ( [ eq : pot_oep5 ] ) .",
    "we however recall that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_oep5 ] ) has no robust fundation .",
    "sic - kli results nevertheless demonstrate the promising possibility to use a numerically less costly localization criterion than the symmetry condition",
    ". indeed , the equivalent gslat in  @xcite perfectly agrees with ours .",
    "the mechanism invoked to explain the better performance of sic - kli ( standard and generalized ) on polarizabilities , over mere lda or standard sic - slater , is that the sic - kli correction , or the so - called response part of the exchange - correlation potential defined in  @xcite , produces a counter - field effect  @xcite  : with an external field , the exchange - correlation potential behaves globally against it .",
    "electronic motion is hindered and polarizabilities are thus reduced compared with a lda treatment . the counter - field effect is all the more efficient when one goes from sic - kli to oep  @xcite or in a generalized sic - kli treatment  @xcite . in gslat ,",
    "no response potential is present , so no counter - field effect is expected here .",
    "indeed , the average gslat exchange - correlation potential in the presence of an external field is not opposite to the electric potential , as the sic - kli or the oep ones are ( see e.g. bottom panels of fig .  2 in  @xcite which correspond to our gslat but obtained with another localization criterion than the symmetry condition ) .",
    "actually , the performance of our gslat approximation stands in the property that much higher barriers ( than in standard sic - slater or sic - kli ) between h@xmath54 units appear in the exchange - correlation potential , which hinder more the electronic motion .",
    "this has to be linked to the localized character of the orbitals that enter into its calculation @xcite .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to also test the generalized sic - kli and its various approximate forms in less symmetrical systems .",
    "this calls for a systematic study which will be reported in a forthcoming paper . keeping this in mind , we will nevertheless present in the following a few examples of applications to less symmetrical systems in the case of gslat in comparison to exact sic .     before doing so",
    ", let us remark that the case of full standard oep results of @xcite ( close squares ) deserve a special comment .",
    "indeed , up to fluctuations , the obtained results perfectly match the mp4 ones ( stars ) , and thus somewhat differ from sic ones .",
    "there is here a matter of interpretation in the sense that , if the aim is to match mp4 results , the results are perfect .",
    "but if it is to find a good approximation to sic then the agreement is not dramatically better than gslat ones ( relative values of oep compared to sic : @xmath55 to @xmath56 from h@xmath0 to h@xmath53 ) and is worse than the loc .",
    "sic - kli ones .",
    "moreover gslat and loc .",
    "sic - kli calculations seen as approximations to full generalized sic - oep are cheaper schemes , easily applicable to much more complex systems than hydrogen chains .",
    "note finally that fig .",
    "[ fig : polh ] also shows the transverse polarizability for those hydrogen chains . in that case , the gslat approximation reproduces perfectly the exact sic results , as expected .",
    "now that the capability of gslat on hydrogen chains has been checked , we deeper analyze the properties of the system in a small chain , namely h@xmath0 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : polh4 ] the values of the ( longitudinal and transverse ) polarizabilities of h@xmath0 chains , according to various h@xmath54-h@xmath54 center of mass distances .",
    "here we used the experimental value of the h@xmath54 bond length , that is 1.46 @xmath42 .",
    "the data labeled `` sic '' constitutes our benchmark .",
    "lda ( stars ) overestimates polarizabilities which was expected on the ground that lda has a tendency to overmetallize bonding .",
    "the simplified adsic ( open squares ) scheme @xcite gives in general rather poor results .",
    "mind that adsic nevertheless allows a fair reproduction of bonding properties in poly - acetylene @xcite .",
    "it obviously fails in the case of the more sensitive polarizability .",
    "gslat ( crosses ) in turn reproduces very well the exact sic tendencies , while the standard sic - slater ( full squares ) is completely wrong for intermediate intermolecular distances .",
    "this mismatch is correlated to a similar failure of standard sic - slater in the potential energy surface at intermediate distances @xcite . and both failures can be tracked back to delocalization effects of the orbitals at critical configurations .",
    "gslat allows to keep the wave functions entering the hamiltonian localized and thus performs much better .",
    "we checked that standard sic - kli ( not shown in the figure ) does not cure this mismatch . for large intermolecular distances ,",
    "standard sic - slater and gslat results come close to each other because there remain two separated h@xmath54 molecules , which have each only one electron in each spin subspace .",
    "another interesting case is provided by small carbon chains whose electrical excitation properties are well studied @xcite .",
    "we consider here two examples , namely the c@xmath54 dimer and the c@xmath0 chain .",
    "since , to the best of our knowledge , there exist no experimental results for the polarizabilities of those systems , our aim is to compare various theoretical approaches using exact sic as a benchmark .",
    "we recall that we already demonstrated the quality of gslat in the case of a single carbon atom in @xcite for exchange only calculations . in exchange correlations calculations ,",
    "the c atom polarizability is again well reproduced by gslat . as the electronic cloud in the c atom",
    "is slightly axially deformed because of the single occupation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 orbitals ( while the @xmath59 orbital is unoccupied ) , one measures different polarizabilities along the @xmath60 axes and along the @xmath61 axis . to put the subsequent results on c molecules into perspective ,",

    "our results are generally lower for @xmath66 .",
    "it is worth noting that our calculations differ in the employed functionals and pseudopotentials which both can have a sensitive influence on the results .",
    "thus the comparison as a whole looks satisfying . to stay on the safe side , we concentrate on the comparison of approaches within the same setup .",

    "gslat starts from the optimized effective potential ( oep ) approach to sic and handles that in terms of two different sets of @xmath68 single - particle wave functions .",
    "one set is taken for the solution of the oep equations , thus diagonal in energy and most likely delocalized .",
    "the other set is used in setting up the sic energy which becomes lowest for localized wave functions .",
    "both sets are connected by a unitary transformation which leaves key features as , e.g , the total density invariant . using that double set",
    "allows to accommodate two conflicting demands , energy diagonality versus locality .",
    "the unitary transformation is determined by minimization of the sic energy which leads to what is called the symmetry condition , a key building block of the sic equations .",
    "the localized character of the sic optimizing set is well suited to justify the steps from oep to sic - kli and further to the sic - slater approximation .",
    "thus sic - oep with double - set representation and subsequent sic - slater approximation leads to the gslat scheme . by virtue of the double - set technique",
    ", it has more flexibility than standard sic - kli or sic - slater approximation .",
    "as it is known that the polarizability in chain molecules is a sensitive observable for dft approaches , we have investigated the performance of the new scheme with respect to polarizability in a variety of critical test cases  : h chains which mimic the electronic properties of polymers , the c@xmath54 dimer , a c@xmath0 chain , and na@xmath1 as a soft small metallic particle .",
    "the results demonstrate that the gslat approximation comes generally close to the values from exact sic which we use here as a benchmark .",
    "it solves the pathologies of the standard sic - slater approximation which occur in critical ( transitional ) molecular configurations such that its performances depend much less on the kind of studied system and configuration ( which is not the case in standard sic - slater or sic - kli ) . for long h chains ,",
    "some deviation is observed , which remains reasonable compared to the other schemes and to the less important numerical cost of the gslat scheme .",
    "however addition of the sic - kli correction ( coming from generalized sic - oep ) allows to improve substancially the results .",
    "nevertheless , no strong argument justifies _ a priori _ the approximate form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_oep5 ] ) , even for spatially symmetrical systems .",
    "and the case has yet to be tested for asymmetrical systems .",
    "we here checked that gslat performs fairly good as well in h chains than in less symmetrical systems as c chains or na clusters .",
    "we finally checked that the improvement of the sic - kli correction over gslat is negligible when looking for other observables as energies ."
