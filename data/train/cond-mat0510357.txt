    "a few decades ago , it was widely accepted that the relaxation of a typical macroscopic observable @xmath3 towards its equilibrium value is described by exponential function @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents time and @xmath6 . on that score ,",
    "probably the best - known example is the newton s law of cooling where the relaxation function @xmath0 refers to thermalization process ( i.e. @xmath7 ) .",
    "recently , however , it was discovered that a number of decay phenomena observed in nature obeys slower non - exponential relaxation ( c.f @xcite ) @xmath8 it was also noticed that non - debye relaxation is usually observed in systems which violate the ergodicity condition . in such systems , the lack of ergodicity results from long - range interactions , microscopic memory effects or from ( multi)fractal structure of phase space .",
    "it was argued that such systems are well described by the so - called nonextensive statistics introduced by tsallis @xcite .",
    "the _ conjectured _ relaxation function for such systems @xcite is given by the @xmath9-exponential decay ) exists for such systems in which nonextensivity arises from intrinsic fluctuations of some parameters describing the system s dynamics @xcite .",
    "] @xmath10^{1/(1-q)}.\\ ] ] which is equivalent to the formula ( [ ftexp ] ) for @xmath11 , whereas for @xmath12 it coincides with ( [ ftsf ] ) .    in the context of the ongoing discussion on possible relations between nonergodicity and nonextensivity",
    ", the phenomenon of non - debye relaxation that has been recently reported by gall and kutner @xcite seems to be particularly interesting ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the authors have numerically studied a simple molecular model as a basis of irreversible heat transfer trough a diathermic partition .",
    "the partition has separated two parts of box containing ideal point particles ( i.e. ideal gases ) that have communicated only through this partition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the energy transfer between the left and right - hand side gas samples has consisted in equipartition of kinetic energy of all outgoing particles colliding with the partition during a given time period .",
    "the authors have analysed and compared two essentially different cases of the system s dynamics :    1 .",
    "the first case , where the border walls of the box and the diathermic partition have randomized the direction of the motion of rebounding particles , and 2 .",
    "the case , where mirror collisions of particles with the border walls and the partition have been considered .    they have found that although the mechanism of heat transfer has been analogous in both cases the long - time behaviour of both thermalization processes has been completely different . in the first case ( i. ) ordinary debye relaxation of the system towards its equilibrium state has been observed @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the temperature difference between both gas samples , while in the second case ( ii . ) the power - law decay has been noticed @xmath15    in order to describe the phenomenon of the non - debye relaxation gall and kutner @xcite have derived an extended version of the thermodynamic fourier - onsager theory @xcite where heat conductivity was assumed to be time - dependent quantity .",
    "the authors have argued that from the microscopic point of view the non - debye relaxation results from the fact that the gas particles always move along fixed orbits in the case ( ii . ) .",
    "they have also argued that this regular motion may be considered as nonergodic , violating the molecular chaos hypothesis ( boltzmann , 1872 ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a more rigorous microscopic explanation of both debye and non - debye thermalization processes reported by gall and kutner .",
    "in the paper @xcite , the authors have analysed two - dimensional systems consisting of two gas samples of comparable size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . here",
    ", due to analytical simplicity we assume that one gas sample is significantly larger and denser than the second one i.e. the larger sample may be referred to as a heat reservoir with constant temperature @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "we also assume that the smaller sample is confined in a square box of linear size @xmath17 and its initial temperature equals @xmath18 .",
    "it is natural to expect that thanks to the existence of the diathermic partition the temperature of the smaller sample will tend to the reservoir temperature @xmath19 in the course of time .",
    "( detailed description is given in the text.),width=226 ]    at the moment , before we analytically justify the relaxation functions ( [ kutexp ] ) and ( [ kutsf ] ) let us recall crucial assumptions of the numerical experiment performed by gall and kutner @xcite .",
    "first , the authors have defined the temperature of the given gas sample @xmath20 as proportional to the average kinetic energy of all particles in the sample @xmath21 second , they have assumed a monoenergetic energy distribution function @xmath22 as the initial condition for each gas sample @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "in fact , since the applied thermalization mechanism evens out kinetic energies of all particles colliding with the diathermic partition at a given time not only initial but also final ( i.e. equilibrium ) energy distributions are monoenergetic .",
    "now , having in mind the above assumptions , one can simply conclude that during the heat transfer occurring in the system presented at fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the particles of the smaller and thinner gas sample get the final energy immediately after _ the first collision _ with the diathermic partitiona possess a similar feature for asymptotic times ( cf .",
    "( 45 ) in @xcite ) . ]",
    "i.e. @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( [ tdef ] ) .",
    "it is possible due to the existence of the huge and dense heat reservoir which causes that the number of particles with energy @xmath27 colliding with the diathermic partition at a given time is overwhelmingly larger than the number of particles with the energy @xmath28 which at the same time collide with the partition from the other site ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig1]b ) .",
    "the above considerations allow us to write the temperature difference between both gas samples in the following way @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of particles of the smaller sample which have not hit the diathermic partition by time @xmath5 .",
    "now , one can see that the relaxation function @xmath0 of the considered systems is equivalent to the survival probability @xmath31 @xmath32    the last formula makes us possible to reduce the phenomena of debye and non - debye relaxations to the first passage processes @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the case ( i. ) of rough border walls directly corresponds to the problem of diffusing particles in a finite domain with an absorbing boundary .",
    "the survival probability @xmath1 typically decays exponentially with time for such systems @xcite .",
    "that is the reason way the thermalization process characterizing the case ( i. ) is equivalent to debye relaxation ( see eq .",
    "( [ kutexp ] ) ) . in the next paragraph",
    "we show that the case ( ii . ) , where mirror bouncing walls and absorbing diathermic partition are taken into account , is indeed characterized by the power law decay of the survival probability @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ kutsf ] ) ) .        in order to achieve the claimed scale - free decay of the survival probability @xmath1 one has to find the so - called first passage probability @xmath33 ( i.e. the probability that a particle of the considered gas sample hits the diathermic partition for the first time at the time @xmath5 ) @xmath34 at the moment ,",
    "let us remind that before the collision with the diathermic partition each particle has the same velocity @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , thus the distribution @xmath33 can be simply calculated from the particle path length distribution @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "now , due to the symmetry of the considered problem ( that is due to the equivalence of paths @xmath40 and @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) one can deduce the following relation @xmath42 where @xmath43 and respectively @xmath44 whereas @xmath45 ( see fig .  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "the last formula expresses the fact that particles can either move to the left ( i.e. towards the diathermic partition ) or to the right ( i.e. towards mirror reflection of the partition ) .",
    "next , assuming uniform initial conditions @xmath46 in the long time limit ( i.e. for small angles when @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) one obtains @xmath49 finally , using the relation ( [ af3 ] ) one gets the desired power - law decay of the survival probability which justifies the non - debye thermalization process ( [ kutsf ] ) @xmath50     against time @xmath5 in systems presented at fig .",
    "points correspond to results of numerical simulations whereas solid lines represent theoretical prediction of the formula ( [ af7]).,width=377 ]    we have numerically verified the last relation for a few different values of both the initial velocity @xmath51 and the box size @xmath17 . in all the considered cases",
    "we have obtained very good agreement of recorded survival probabilities with the formula ( [ af7 ] ) ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have given a microscopic explanation of debye and non - debye thermalization processes that have been recently reported by gall and kutner @xcite .",
    "the authors have studied a simple molecular mechanism of heat transfer between two comparable gas samples .",
    "owing to analytical simplicity we have reduced the problem to one gas sample being in thermal contact with the huge and dense heat reservoir at constant temperature . for the case",
    "we have shown that the thermalization mechanism described by gall and kutner can be reduced to first passage phenomena .",
    "taking advantage of the idea we have found an analytical justification for both exponential ( [ kutexp ] ) and non - exponential ( [ kutsf ] ) relaxation functions observed in @xcite .",
