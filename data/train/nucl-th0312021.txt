    "for over forty years now the three - nucleon problem has , with considerable success , been used as a testing ground for the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "usually the three - body equations used are based on the schrdinger equation or its implementation for scattering in the form of the faddeev  @xcite equations with the two - body interaction being one of finite range . however , discussions of the case in which the range of the interaction is significantly less than the wavelengths of interest , i.e. @xmath0 , also have a long history .",
    "there has been renewed interest in this case with the advent of effective field theory ( eft ) descriptions of few - nucleon systems at low energy  @xcite . in an eft treatment of the problem of two- and three - body scattering at energies",
    "such that @xmath1 the two - body scattering problem requires renormalization since the leading - order two - body potential is a three - dimensional delta function .",
    "but in low - energy @xmath2 scattering @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not the only scales in the problem .",
    "the presence of a low - energy bound state in the @xmath2 system  the deuteron  means that we must also account for the deuteron binding momentum @xmath5with @xmath6 the unnaturally - large @xmath2 scattering length  when we do an eft analysis of this problem .",
    "in technical terms the presence of an enhanced two - body scattering length  or equivalently a near - zero - energy bound state  means that there is a non - trivial fixed point in the renormalization - group evolution of this leading - order potential . as long as this",
    "is accounted for , and a power counting built around the scale hierarchy : @xmath7 a systematic eft can be established and renormalized using a variety of regularization schemes  @xcite . a similar scale hierarchy ( and hence a similar eft )",
    "governs the low - energy interactions of helium-4 atoms  @xcite .",
    "it is also relevant to the physics of bose - einstein condensates , if the external magnetic field is adjusted such that the atoms ( e.g. @xmath8rb ) are near a feshbach resonance  @xcite .    as a first step in extending this eft to heavier nuclei ,",
    "the three - nucleon system was considered , and the faddeev equations for the particular case of a zero - range interaction were solved .",
    "it was soon discovered that the leading - order ( lo ) eft equation for the quartet ( total angular momentum @xmath9 ) channel yielded a unique solution  @xcite , while for the doublet ( total angular momentum @xmath10 ) channel the corresponding equation did not yield a unique solution  at least in the absence of three - body forces  @xcite .",
    "this could be simply understood on the grounds that in the quartet channel the effective interaction between the neutron and the deuteron is repulsive as a result of the pauli principle , and this ultimately means that the neutron and deuteron do not experience a zero - range interaction .",
    "in contrast , in the doublet channel the effective neutron - deuteron interaction is attractive and the full difficulties of the zero - range interaction manifest themselves .",
    "these difficulties were first elucidated by thomas , who pointed out that  if two - body forces alone are employed  the nuclear force must have a finite range if the binding energy of nuclei is to be finite  @xcite .",
    "the three - body scattering problem for zero - range interactions considered in the seminal work of bedaque and collaborators  @xcite was first considered in research that antedates faddeev s landmark 1961 paper : by skorniakov and ter - martirosian  @xcite and by danilov  @xcite .",
    "these authors found similar difficulties to bedaque _ et al .",
    "_ , and traced the non - uniqueness to the fact that in the asymptotic region this three - body equation for scattering reduces to a homogeneous equation whose solution can be added to the solution of the inhomogeneous equation with an arbitrary weighting  a point recently reiterated by blankleider and gegelia  @xcite .    in their 1999 papers",
    "@xcite , bedaque _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a three - body force into the leading - order three - body eft equation , so as to obtain a unique solution for 1 + 2 phase shifts .",
    "they adjusted this force in order to reproduce the experimental 1 + 2 scattering length .",
    "the energy dependence of the 1 + 2 phase shift was then predicted  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of this three - body force is unexpected if naive dimensional analysis is used to estimate the size of various effects in the eft , but it is apparently necessary if the equations are to yield sensible , unique predictions for physical observables .",
    "this also accords with the 1995 paper of adhikhari , frederico , and goldman , who pointed out that the divergences in the kernel of the faddeev equations for a zero - range interaction may necessitate the introduction of a piece of three - body data so that these divergences can be renormalized away  @xcite .",
    "( but see refs .",
    "@xcite for a conflicting view . )    in an attempt to get some insight into alternative ways to establish a unique solution to the three - body scattering problem at leading order in the effective field theory , we try to bridge the gap between the faddeev approach  in which the interaction has a finite range  and the eft formulation of this problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we examine the amado model  @xcite for the case of three spinless bosons . here",
    "we look at scattering in which the interaction of an incident particle on a composite system of the other two is considered within the framework of the lagrangian for the lee model  @xcite .",
    "if three - body forces are neglected then the only difference between this approach and those at lo in the eft of refs .",
    "@xcite is that in the lee model lagrangian one may introduce a form factor that plays the role of a cut - off in the theory . in this way we can connect the lo eft equations ( without a three - body force ) to those found in the amado model , by taking the limit as the range of the interaction goes to zero .",
    "the resulting equation has a non - compact kernel unless a cutoff is imposed on the momentum integration .",
    "we then reproduce and reiterate the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , demonstrating that the low - energy solution of the equation changes radically as the cutoff is varied . using a renormalization - group analysis we trace this unreasonable cutoff dependence to the presence of eigenvalues equal to 1 in the kernel of the integral equation .",
    "in section  [ sec3 ] we use a subtraction originally developed by hammer and mehen  @xcite to remove these eigenvalues .",

    "@xcite was employed at a specific energy , and used experimental data from the three - body system to determine the half - off - shell behaviour of the 1 + 2-amplitude . here",
    "we go further , and show that using low - energy two - body data plus just one piece of experimental data for the three - body system  the 1 + 2 scattering length  we can predict the low - energy three - body phase shifts .",
    "we do this by first solving the subtracted integral equation for the half - off - shell threshold 1 + 2-amplitude .",
    "we then use this result to derive unique predictions for the full off - shell behaviour of the 1 + 2-threshold - amplitude , and thence for the 1 + 2-amplitude at any energy .",
    "the equations derived in this way are equivalent to those of bedaque _ et al .",
    "_ , but represent a reformulation of the problem in which only physical , renormalized quantities appear . in consequence the leading - order three - body force of refs",
    ".  @xcite does not appear in our equations .",
    "our single subtraction ultimately allows us to generate predictions for the energy - dependence of the 1 + 2 phase shifts at leading order in the eft without the presence of an explicit three - body force .",
    "the subtraction does , though , require data from the three - body system ( namely the 1 + 2 scattering length ) before other three - body observables can be predicted .    in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we apply the formalism of secs .  [ sec2][sec3 ] to the  conceptually identical but technically more complicated  case of the doublet channel in nd scattering . here",

    "the resulting description of the doublet phase shifts is very good up to the deuteron breakup threshold .",
