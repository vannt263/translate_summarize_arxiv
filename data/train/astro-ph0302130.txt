    "the serendipitous detection of emission coming from the direction of the cygnus ob2 stellar association by the hegra ct - system at la palma ( daum et al .",
    "1997 ) represents the first discovery of an unidentified tev source , extending the mystery of the elusive @xmath0-ray sources to the tev regime .",
    "tev j2032 + 4130 was discovered ( aharonian et al .",
    "2002a ) in observations originally devoted to cygnus x3 and the unidentified egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) source gev j2035 + 4214 ( lamb & macomb 1997 ) .",
    "an analysis of these combined fields led to the detection of a source at ( j2000 ) @xmath9 .",
    "its error circle overlaps the edge of the 95% confidence error ellipse of another egret source , 3eg j2033 + 4118 , and is @xmath10 north of cyg x3 .",
    "it is not clear if tev j2032 + 4130 is associated with 3eg j2033 + 4118 , which is itself of uncertain origin .",
    "there is some evidence that the tev emission is extended , with a gaussian @xmath11 radius of @xmath12 . unlike the flaring blazars that have been detected so far , tev j2032 + 4130",
    "was found to be steady in repeated hegra observations from 1999 to 2001 . the integrated flux measured above 1  tev",
    "was found to be @xmath13 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 , which is @xmath15 of the flux of the crab nebula ( aharonian et al .",
    "2002a ) .    the majority of the @xmath0-ray sources detected above 100 mev by the egret instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( cgro ) are unidentified , some remaining so since the first surveys of the @xmath0-ray sky with the cos  b satellite .",
    "resolving the nature of these mysterious @xmath0-ray sources is a challenge across all wavelengths .",
    "their relatively large error boxes make counterpart searches difficult .",
    "unidentified egret sources typically have positional uncertainties of @xmath16 , making identification on the basis of position alone nearly impossible , especially in the galactic plane .",
    "we have found that multiwavelength studies of egret fields on a case - by - case basis are often useful in finding a likely identification .",
    "such an approach has been used to suggest counterparts for the egret unidentified sources 2eg j0635 + 0521 ( kaaret et al . 1999 ) , 3eg j2227 + 6122 ( halpern et al .",
    "2001a ) , 3eg j1835 + 5918 ( halpern et al . 2002 ; mirabal et al .",
    "2000,2001 ) , 3eg j20062321 ( wallace et al . 2002 ) , 3eg j2016 + 3657 ( mukherjee et al . 2000 ; halpern et al .",
    "2001b ) , 3eg j1621 + 8203 ( mukherjee et al . 2002 ) , and 3eg 2021 + 3716 ( roberts et al . 2002 ) , to name a few examples ( see the review by caraveo 2002 ) .    imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) like hegra have the advantage of much better angular resolution , and therefore smaller error boxes for @xmath0-ray source positions in comparison to egret . in this paper , we adopt for the moment the hypothesis that tev j2032 + 4130 is _ not _ significantly extended , in which case one should search for and evaluate candidate point - source counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "accordingly , we studied the egret source 3eg j2033 + 4118 , archival radio data from the nrao - vla sky survey ( nvss : condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and pointed _ rosat _ x - ray observations of the field of 3eg j2033 + 4118 and tev j2032 + 4130 .",
    "we also examined a recent _ chandra _ observation that was centered on the tev source , and obtained optical identifications of the brightest x - ray sources in this region using the mdm observatory , kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , and the _ hobby - eberly telescope _ ( _ het _ ) .",
    "the egret source 3eg j2033 + 4118 is located at @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , with a 95% error ellipse defined by semi - major and semi - minor axes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( mattox , hartman , & reimer 2001 ) . figure  1 shows the 95% confidence egret ellipse superimposed on a _ rosat _ x - ray image that is described further in  3 .",
    "3eg j2033 + 4118 was detected by egret in several viewing periods , with the most significant detection in 1993 march ( vp 212 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the light curve measured by egret during 19911997 .",
    "the points before 1996 come from the third egret catalog ( 3eg , hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , in which the summed exposure has a flux above 100 mev of @xmath21 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding background - subtracted spectrum of 3eg j2033 + 4118 is hard , with a photon spectral index of @xmath22 ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this location was also in the egret field of view four times after the 3eg catalog . for two of these the source was almost @xmath23 from the axis , so we exclude them .",
    "the remaining two detections are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "their fluxes are shown as the last two points in figure  2 .",
    "a chi - square analysis was used to calculate the `` variability index '' defined by mclaughlin et al .",
    "this index is sometimes used to judge variability in egret sources , although it is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the variability index of 3eg j2033 + 4118 was found to be @xmath26 . for comparison , mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) interpret @xmath27 as non - variable and @xmath28 as variable .",
    "figure  1 shows an x - ray image taken with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) in the energy range 0.22.0 kev , covering the field of 3eg j2033 + 4118/tev j2032 + 4130 .",
    "this image was created by co - adding exposure - corrected skymaps of 23.5 ks of data taken during 1991 and 1993 .",
    "these fields were targeted originally to include the cyg ob2 association and also cyg x-3 .",
    "the egret 95% error ellipse for 3eg j2033 + 4118 is superposed on the image , as is the @xmath11 error contour of the tev j2032 + 4130 centroid position .",

    "we list the coordinates of the brightest rosat sources as marked in figures 1 and 3 , along with optical identifications and positions .",
    "we have concentrated on obtaining optical identifications of several x - ray sources that are within the region of maximum likelihood for a point source of tev emission .",
    "we find that all of these have ordinary stellar counterparts .",
    "further details on their optical properties are presented in  4.2 .    on 2002",

    "2003 ) of the field of tev j2032 + 4130 with the front - illuminated , imaging ccd array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) .",
    "several x - ray sources near the centroid of the tev source were detected .",

    "their positions and count rates are listed in table  2 .",

    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ are indicated in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the brightest _ chandra _ source # 2 is notable in that it was _ not _ detected in any of the _ rosat _ or _ einstein _ observations of this field .",
    "more details about this source are given in  5.1 .",
    "table  3 is a list of eight 1.4 ghz sources from the nvss within @xmath30 of the tev centroid .",
    "the brightest is an extended source with flux density of only 18 mjy , which is at least an order of magnitude fainter than the weakest candidate radio sources for egret blazars considered by mattox et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . furthermore",
    ", none of the radio sources is coincident with an x - ray source .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that tev j2032 + 4130 has an ordinary blazar counterpart , although new types of blazars can be hypothesized ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "in preparation for the identification of x - ray sources in the _ chandra _ observation , on 2002 july  7 we obtained a deep @xmath31-band image of the field of tev j2032 + 4130 using the mdm 1.3 m telescope and a thinned , back - illuminated @xmath32 pixel site ccd .",
    "this @xmath33 image covers all of the _ chandra _ source positions marked in figure  4 .",
    "an astrometric grid was established for the image using 51 stars from the usno ",
    "a2.0 catalog ( monet et al . 1996 ) , with a resulting rms dispersion of @xmath34 . differences between optical and x - ray positions for the most precisely located x - ray sources indicate that the x - ray aspect solution agrees with the usno ",
    "a2.0 reference frame to within @xmath35 .",
    "additional images in @xmath36 and @xmath37 were obtained of the central @xmath38 of the same field using the mdm 2.4 m telescope on 2002 august 2328 .",
    "likely optical identifications of _ chandra _ sources are listed in table  2 , together with approximate @xmath31 magnitudes from our images or from the usno ",
    "where available .",
    "only four of the _ chandra _ sources have no optical counterpart to a limiting magnitude @xmath39 .",
    "these happen to be the hardest sources in the image , with @xmath40 of their photons above 2  kev .",
    "thus they are likely to be agns that are highly absorbed by the galactic ism , and not , for example , nearby , old neutron stars . a higher - resolution image of the crowded region around _",
    "chandra _ source # 2 was obtained on the mdm 2.4 m telescope on 2002 november  24 .",
    "figure  5 shows the possible identification of that source on the 2.4 m image .",
    "we obtained complete spectroscopic identifications for all _ rosat _ sources within @xmath41 of the centroid of tev j2032 + 4130 , using the goldcam spectrograph on the kpno 2.1 m telescope on two runs , in 2002 june and october .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure  6 . these are sources @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in table 1 , and all are bright stars .",
    "they include one emission - line o star , one dme star , and three foreground g stars , two of which are also listed in the massey & thompson ( 1991 , hereafter mt91 ) compilation of stars in cyg ob2 .",
    "magnitudes listed in table  1 are from mt91 , or from the usno  a2.0 catalog ( monet et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a spectrum of the @xmath47 counterpart of _ chandra _ source # 2 , also shown in figure  6 , was obtained with the _ het _ and marcario low resolution spectrograph on 2002 december 8 .",
    "however , its classification remains uncertain as it is of relatively poor signal - to - noise , having been observed through thin clouds .",
    "all of the apparent features in this spectrum can be attributed to imperfectly subtracted night - sky emission lines , leaving no definite intrinsic features in the 46009200   range .",
    "none of the x - ray sources in the immediate vicinity of tev j2032 + 4130 are unusual in any way , except for _ chandra _ source # 2 , which lies @xmath2 from the tev centroid .",
    "although this is the brightest of the _ chandra _ sources , with 195 photons detected , it is noticeably absent from any of the _ rosat _ or _ einstein _ images .",
    "thus , it may be described as a transient source . a light curve constructed from the 5  ks _ chandra _",
    "observation shows that the source was highly variable even during this brief period ( figure  7 ) . after remaining faint for the first 3.5 ks , its count rate rose by about a factor of 10 for the final 1.5 ks .",
    "spectral analysis of source # 2 , summarized in table  4 , is consistent with a power law of photon index @xmath48 , or with a hot plasma of @xmath49 kev .",
    "in addition to spectral fits for the summed observation , table  4 presents fits for two intervals , corresponding to the first 3438  s ( low state ) and the final 1478  s ( high state ) .",
    "figure  8 shows the spectrum and best fitted power law for the summed observation . for either spectral model , a significant absorbing column of @xmath50  @xmath14",
    "is required , which is comparable to the largest x - ray and optical extinction values measured for stars in the cyg ob2 association ( mt91 ; waldron et al .",
    "thus , source # 2 is likely to be either embedded in the cyg ob2 association at @xmath51  pc ( mt91 ) , or behind it .",
    "its peak 110  kev flux of @xmath52 ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath6 would correspond to a luminosity of @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath6 at @xmath51  pc .",
    "this value is somewhat larger than even the most luminous cataclysmic variables ( eracleous , halpern , & patterson 1991 ) , and hints at a more compact source such as a neutron star or black hole in a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , or a very distant be transient . if so , its location could be considerably beyond cyg ob2",
    ".    the transition in the light curve of # 2 may be an egress from an eclipse , or , more likely for an lmxb , a `` dip '' .",
    "if so , the orbital period is probably longer than a few hours since the eclipse or dip is at least 1 hr long . a possible",
    "analog would be 4u  162449 , the `` big dipper , '' which has period of 21  hr ( watson et al .",
    "1985 ; smale , church , & baluciska - church 2001 ) .",
    "however , assuming a distance of 8  kpc , the x - ray luminosity of # 2 would be only @xmath54 ergs s@xmath6 , much less than the @xmath55 ergs s@xmath6 luminosity of 4u  162449 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the signal - to - noise ratio of the _ het _ optical spectrum of the counterpart to source # 2 is too poor to classify it .",
    "however , it is likely to be the correct identification because the x - ray and optical positions differ by only @xmath56 .",
    "the absence of strong tio absorption bands rules out a late k or m dwarf , which would otherwise be the expected spectral type for a star of its magnitude and color located between us and the cyg ob2 association .",
    "additional evidence that it is a more distant and luminous object comes from its detection in the 2mass survey , with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the absence of h@xmath59 emission argues against a cataclysmic variable , as does the high - state x - ray luminosity of @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , although it can not be ruled out that the optical spectrum is highly reddened emission from an accretion disk in a quiescent lmxb .",
    "if we hypothesize a very large visual extinction of @xmath60 , which is compatible with the value of @xmath61 fitted to the x - ray spectrum , then the dereddened magnitudes become @xmath62 , and @xmath63 using the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "such a flat color distribution would be compatible with accretion disk emission in an lmxb . assuming a distance of 8  kpc , the corresponding absolute magnitude @xmath64 is also in the range of lmxbs ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "however , even at that large distance , the x - ray luminosity would be only @xmath54 ergs s@xmath6 , and then it is not clear that the accretion luminosity would dominate over the secondary star in the optical .",
    "also , such a source would fall far from the relation between absolute magnitude , x - ray luminosity , and orbital period in lmxbs delineated by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ) , having too small an x - ray luminosity .    alternatively ,",
    "if the distance and extinction are even larger , then it could be an early type star such as a b star in a transient high - mass x - ray binary system .",
    "however , the absence of h@xmath59 emission argues against a be star .",
    "thus , there are no entirely satisfactory explanations of source # 2 in terms of any type of x - ray binary .",
    "while an agn classification for the optical spectrum of source # 2 can not be immediately dismissed , the absence of any emission lines would favor a bl  lac identification , for which the lack of radio emission is highly unusual . also , the known tev blazars are highly episodic emitters , which is contrary to the steady nature of tev j2032 + 4130 .",
    "thus , it would not be a simplification to hypothesize that # 2 is an agn .",
    "nevertheless , it has long been hypothesized that a class of radio - quiet blazars could exist ( mannheim 1993 ; schlickeiser 1984 ) that are dominated by accelerated hadrons . in this `` proton blazar '' model ,",
    "@xmath0-ray emission arises from proton - induced cascades , and radio emission can be reduced if the ratio of accelerated electrons to protons is small .",
    "alternatively , an extreme blazar whose synchrotron emission peaks at mev energies , and inverse compton at tev energies , could be relevant ( ghisellini 1999 ) . because hegra performed a sensitive survey of the galactic plane ( aharonian et al .",
    "2002b ) , it may not be so surprising if it turns out that the first tev selected blazar is discovered there .",
    "spectroscopic optical identifications of most of the brighter x - ray sources in @xmath0-ray error boxes of tev j2032 + 4130 and 3eg j2033 + 4118 are o stars in the cyg ob2 association at @xmath1 kpc , or foreground late - type stars . those _ chandra _ sources that are identified with faint optical counterparts in the range @xmath65 , are probably m dwarfs , while the optically undetected sources with @xmath66 are the most x - ray absorbed , thus are likely background agns . the only unusual x - ray source in this field is a transient one that is the brightest source in the recent _ chandra _ observation .",
    "it has a peak 110  kev luminosity of @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "an optical spectrum of its @xmath67 possible counterpart has , albeit with modest signal - to - noise , no strong emission or absorption features .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum , rapid variability , and red optical / ir colors of this object suggest that it is a distant , quiescent x - ray binary system . on the other hand",
    ", it may also be the prototype of a new kind of agn previously hypothesized to exist , the `` proton blazar . ''",
    "if so , its x - ray flaring behavior is a significant property , and related optical variability might be expected .    if we hypothesize that either tev j2032 + 4130 or 3eg j2033 +",
    "4118 is a point source , then we have a limited number of plausible point - source candidates at other wavelengths , perhaps only one . without knowing the exact nature of _ chandra _ source # 2",
    ", it is not a compelling identification for either tev j2032 + 4130 or 3eg j2033 + 4118 , especially since it lies outside both of their @xmath3 localization regions .",
    "it is @xmath2 from the centroid of the tev source , while the @xmath3 position uncertainty of tev j2032 + 4130 is given as @xmath68 .",
    "however , since we are faced with the first unidentified tev source , it is worthwhile to pursue whatever additional observations are needed to determine the nature of this variable x - ray candidate and to assess the possibility of its connection with tev j2032 + 4130 , no matter how remote .",
    "if tev j2032 + 4130 is truly an extended source , then it need not be centered on a point source counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "benaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that colliding winds from the cyg ob2 # 5 system and from other o stars in this association could be responsible for the egret source 3eg j2033 + 4118 .",
    "aharonian et al .",
    "( 2002a ) summarized those arguments , and hypothesized two possible origins for extended tev emission that may be displaced from its originating source of energy .",
    "one is that tev emission could arise from @xmath69 decay resulting from hadrons accelerated in shocked ob star winds and interacting with a local , dense gas cloud .",
    "the other is inverse compton tev emission in a jet - driven termination shock , either from an as - yet undetected microquasar , or from cyg x-3 .",
    "another reason to investigate the nature of _ chandra _ # 2 would be to find out if it could be such a jet source .",
    "we plan to pursue more detailed x - ray and optical studies of this source .",
