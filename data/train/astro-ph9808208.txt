    "for years , the crab nebula has provided astronomers with numerous puzzles , and it continues to do so to this day .",
    "the crab presents an excellent opportunity to study the interaction of a pulsar with its surrounding supernova remnant , and x - rays have provided some of the most probing insights .",
    "early in the era of x - ray astronomy , it was learned that the x - ray emission from the crab was not confined to a point source and that the centroid of the x - ray emission was not coincident with the pulsar ( e.g. bowyer et al .",
    "1964 ) . to explain this offset , aschenbach & brinkmann ( 1975 ) proposed a model for the distribution of x - rays around the pulsar .",
    "this model built on previous models ( e.g. rees & gunn 1974 ) that were based on the idea that the pulsar at the center of the nebula released a fraction of its energy in the form of a relativistic wind of electrons and positrons . the seemingly strange emission geometry could be reproduced if this wind was preferentially directed in the pulsar s rotational equatorial plane .",
    "when the ram pressure of the wind equals the pressure of the surrounding medium , a shock occurs , and the particles begin to synchrotron radiate .",
    "this scenario gives rise to a torus of emission in the rotational equatorial plane of the pulsar .",
    "indeed , with imaging x - ray telescopes , this proposed morphology was detected ( brinkmann , aschenbach , & langmeier 1985 ) .",
    "this much alone can explain extended emission , but it does not necessarily explain why the brightest region of x - ray emission was to the northwest of the pulsar .",
    "aschenbach & brinkmann ( 1975 ) further suggested that this brighter region could be due to a local enhancement of the magnetic field .",
    "the pulsar s proper motion is also towards the northwest ( trimble 1971 ) , and it is suggested that the pulsar is moving relative to the nebula . if this is the case , it will `` pile - up '' magnetic field lines in the forward direction , producing a region of stronger magnetic field and higher synchrotron emission .    an alternative explanation for the enhanced northwest brightness is provided by relativistic beaming effects ( pelling et al .",
    "1987 ) . using scanning modulation collimator observations from 22 to 64 kev , pelling et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found that the x - ray emission to the northwest was 5 times brighter than to the southeast .",
    "they were able to explain this difference with relativistic effects if the bulk motion of the radiating particles is at a speed @xmath3 , which is in good agreement with expectations for the conditions achieved after a highly relativistic wind passes through a shock ( blandford & rees 1974 ) .",
    "in this letter , we present the most detailed and deepest x - ray data set available for the crab nebula to date and discuss some striking variations that occur over a span of 6 years . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the observations and processing techniques . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the regions where the strongest variations occur and show light curves , and in section 4 , we discuss the plausibility of certain models in light of the new data .",
    "finally , sections 5 and 6 present some remaining difficulties , summarize the results , and make basic predictions .",
    "all observations discussed herein were taken with the rntgen satellite ( rosat ) high resolution imager ( hri ) ( trmper 1983 , pfeffermann et al .",
    "1986 ) , and processing was performed with the midas / exsas software package ( zimmermann et al .",
    "table  [ tab : obs - data ] gives details of observation dates and exposure times .",
    "all observations were performed with the satellite in wobble mode , so any particular feature in the nebula passed over several hundred detector pixels . in this way , the effects of pixel to pixel variations in the detector are minimized .",
    "in addition , the observation from september 1992 was actually a series of calibration observations with the pulsar offset from the detector center along various directions .",
    "these observations were aligned and co - added to produce a single image for 1992 september .",
    "further processing was performed on the 1995 march and the 1996 march observations to improve the image quality .",
    "these two observations suffered from inaccuracies in the satellite aspect solution that resulted in the pulsar image appearing quite noticeably elliptical , and this effect was corrected .",
    "each data set was originally binned at @xmath4 resolution ( twice the detector pixel size , but still less than the mirror resolution ) .",
    "these images were aligned by performing a two dimensional gaussian fit to the pulsar image , and the centers determined by these fits were aligned .",
    "the formal errors of the center position from the gaussian fits were significantly less than @xmath4 .",
    "after this , a cross - correlation analysis was performed on the images to determine if there was a rotation about the pulsar position that would produce a better alignment . since it has the longest exposure time , we used the 1997 image as the reference .",
    "we found that only the 1991 and 1992 images showed an improved correlation with a rotation of @xmath5 .",
    "this relative rotation is presumably due to a spacecraft rotation , and is not an intrinsic property of the nebula . in the remainder of this letter , when referring to the 1991 and 1992 images , we are discussing the images after this rotation correction has been applied .",
    "this rotation does not affect our results in any significant manner .",
    "after the images were aligned , they were then rebinned in @xmath6 pixels to better match the telescope resolution ( aschenbach 1988 ) .",
    "the rebinning was done so that the gaussian center of the pulsar emission was itself centered on a pixel .",
    "this resulted in most of the pulsar emission falling in a single pixel .",
    "all further analysis was performed at this @xmath6 resolution .",
    "since we were dealing with observations of varying exposure times , we had to be careful in how to compare the different images .",
    "using the count rate would be a logical solution , but although the first four observations ( 19911996 ) had count rates that were within 2% of each other ( @xmath7 c / s , not corrected for dead time ) , the 1997 observation had a count rate that was @xmath8 lower .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not clear , although we attribute it to a change in the hri sensitivity and not to an intrinsic variation in the nebula .",
    "we decided to normalize the images by dividing by the number of counts within the region that contained the nebula .",
    "since the nebular emission is not symmetric with respect to the pulsar , this region is not quite centered on the pulsar .",
    "we chose a @xmath9 ( 56 @xmath10 56 pixel ) region that ranges in right ascension from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and in declination from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we chose @xmath15 statistics to quantify the significance of detected variations between images @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and with the normalization that we have adopted @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of photons in the @xmath20 pixel , and @xmath21 is the number of counts in the region of interest .",
    "the terms in parentheses in the denominator are negligible for single pixel comparisons , but later we will select regions larger than one pixel , and this additional term becomes more important .    with five different observations ,",
    "there are ten different image comparisons that can be computed . for each of the possible combinations",
    ", we produced a @xmath15 image , where the content of a given pixel is determined by the formula give above .",
    "these images are displayed in figure  [ fig : allchis ] .",
    "each row and column corresponds to a given observation date , and the image at the intersection of a row and column is the @xmath15 image derived from the two corresponding observations .",
    "the reduced @xmath15 value of the entire region is also indicated at the lower left of each image . in this figure ,",
    "the scale shown at the bottom , ranges from @xmath22 to 100 , where 41 is a @xmath23 difference when taking into account the number of image pixels ( 3136 ) .",
    "two things are immediately noticeable .",
    "first , as one compares images separated by longer intervals , the differences become more strongly pronounced .",
    "this is also presented in figure  [ fig : chi2_vs_t ] .",
    "second , the differences are confined to very particular regions in the image ; they are not smoothly distributed over the nebula .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi9792 ] shows the comparison of the 1992 and 1997 images ( the two with the longest exposure times ) .",
    "overlaid on the @xmath15 image are contours indicating the position of the pulsar and the outer regions of the x - ray structure , indications of the positions of the torus and jets , and outlines of the most pronounced regions of change .    by choosing regions larger than one pixel , we can dramatically improve the statistics .",
    "this has been done for the regions indicated in figure  [ fig : chi9792 ] .",
    "the light curves and @xmath15 values for these regions are presented in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] .",
    "another interesting result is that these regions do not show the same history .",
    "some regions show an increase in emission , while others show a decrease .",
    "even the two most significant regions ( w and sw in figure  [ fig : chi9792 ] ) , which are adjacent to one another , show opposite behavior .",
    "region sw appears to be a feature projecting radially from the pulsar .",
    "if this is truly the case , one would expect that regions at different radial distances would respond at different times to a change originating in the vicinity of the pulsar .",
    "the light curves of five regions along the length of sw ( figure  [ fig : swlc ] ) reveal that this is not the case .",
    "the onset of the brightness increase appears to set in around 1994 in all the light curves .",
    "this can be understood if regions sw is actually composed of several areas in the torus with equal radial distances from the pulsar .",
    "any changes originating near the pulsar would reach these locations at the same time , and the apparent radial orientation would simply be a projection effect .      with the large count rate of the crab nebula , the statistical errors turn out to be quite small , so we have to be very careful of possible systematic errors .",
    "there are two major possible sources of error : variations in detector sensitivity over the six years and misalignment of the images .",
    "to test for detector variations , we performed the identical analysis on two archival observations of cas a. the first was taken on 29 july 1990 and had an exposure of 8 ksec .",
    "the second was taken from 23 december 1995 to 1 february 1996 and lasted 180 ksec .",
    "the images were aligned and rebinned in a manner similar to that described above .",
    "since cas a lacks a bright point source , our alignment is likely to be less accurate than that for the crab . even with these larger positioning uncertainties ,",
    "we calculate that over the entire region that we have considered , @xmath24 for cas a , which is much less than the values calculated for the crab nebula at similar time separations ( figure  [ fig : chi2_vs_t ] ) .",
    "the same thing is true in each of the regions identified in figure  [ fig : chi9792 ] .",
    "thus , using cas a as our standard we conclude that the observed effects are not caused by variations in detector sensitivity .    to test for possible errors in our alignment procedure we used the 1997 crab image and shifted it by 1 , 2 , and 5  in various directions , binned it to 5  resolution , and compared it with the original 1997 image .",
    "we found that an offset of even 1  could produce an extremely high @xmath25 .",
    "the largest @xmath26 .",
    "inspection of the resulting @xmath15 images reveals that the region near the pulsar produces the largest contribution to the total @xmath15 , a behavior that is not seen in our data .",
    "if we exclude the @xmath27 pixel region centered on the pulsar , the @xmath25 drops by @xmath28 in our deliberately shifted images , while excluding the same region in our data produces changes in @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , other factors lead us to believe that poor alignment does not contribute strongly . to reproduce the temporal behavior seen in figure  [ fig : chi2_vs_t ] and figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] , the relative offsets could not simply be random .",
    "the @xmath15 in the shifted images is largest near the pulsar , as mentioned above , or at surface brightness edges .",
    "although we do see some variations occuring near the edges of the nebula , the most striking regions are within or close to the torus , away from areas of strong brightness contrast .",
    "therefore , we also believe that our alignments are accurate enough that the significance of these variations is not in doubt .",
    "a most intriguing feature of these variations is that , with one exception ( region e ) they occur in regions that are either aligned with the torus or with a polar jet . here",
    "we will discuss the regions that are apparently associated with the torus ( s , n , w , ne , sw ) .    as mentioned above ,",
    "there have been two ideas put forth to explain the enhanced nebular brightness to the northwest : increased magnetic field in the region and relativistic effects .",
    "we will first try to understand the observed variations in terms of these models under the assumption that the intrinsic electron and photon spectra have remained constant .",
    "let us first consider the magnetic field explanation .",
    "as pointed out in aschenbach & brinkmann ( 1975 ) , shklovskii ( 1957 ) shows that increasing the magnetic field by a factor @xmath30 increases the synchrotron volume emissivity by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the power law index of the electron distribution in the nebula . for synchrotron emission",
    ", the observed index of the differential photon energy spectrum ( @xmath33 ) can be related to the index of the differential electron spectrum ( @xmath32 ) by @xmath34 ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "using @xmath35 for the crab implies that @xmath36 , and the corresponding increase in synchrotron volume emissivity is given by @xmath37 .",
    "if we let this magnetic field `` boost '' factor be represented by @xmath38 , then we can determine that @xmath39 .",
    "assuming that the length of a given emitting region along the line of sight remains unchanged implies that the emitting volume is constant .",
    "therefore changes in the volume emissivity will be directly observable as changes in the surface brightness .",
    "although it is not straightforward to specify a change in observed brightness for every region ( in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] , regions n and s are particularly confusing ) , we can assign a value of @xmath40 for region w , which means that @xmath41 .",
    "following the reasoning of aschenbach & brinkmann ( 1975 ) , an increase in the magnetic field strength could be due to the piling up of magnetic field lines as the pulsar moves through the nebula .",
    "the direction of the pulsar s motion ( trimble 1971 ) is roughly towards region w , so with this explanation , one would expect this region to show an increase in count rate .",
    "in fact , it shows the opposite . to produce a decrease in emission , the magnetic field lines would have to spread farther apart .",
    "furthermore , to produce adjacent regions that exhibit opposite brightness changes would require a rather complicated magnetic field reorientation .",
    "the suggestion by pelling et al .",
    "( 1987 ) that the brightness enhancement to the northwest is due to a combination of relativistic aberration and doppler shifting can also be investigated .",
    "they determined that , by using the torus orientation determined by aschenbach & brinkmann ( 1975 ) , the increased brightness to the northwest can be explained if the emitting particles have a bulk motion with @xmath42 .",
    "we can in principle perform the same analysis with the rosat hri data .",
    "it is not obvious , though , how to select regions on the torus for comparison .",
    "if the bulk flow is uniform and is confined to a plane , our @xmath43 determination should not depend on which regions are chosen .",
    "unfortunately , we would still have the difficulty that different sections of the torus show different time behaviors in addition to the fact that the better angular resolution reveals that certain regions are really a combination of polar and toroidal emission .",
    "the torus appears to be inclined at 30  to the line of sight with the major axis of the projected toroidal ellipse aligned @xmath44 east of north ( aschenbach & brinkmann 1975 , hester et al .",
    "the northwest region is pointed toward the observer , while the southeast region points away . in order to be able to determine an estimate of @xmath43 for the bulk motion we chose six regions aligned with the torus ( three on the front side and three on the back ) . to limit the effects of the variations",
    ", we used the sum of all five images to determine the brightness .",
    "all regions were 20@xmath10 20 , and table  [ tab : beta ] indicates the locations of the regions ( @xmath45 is the angle measured counterclockwise from west ) and the number of photons in the region .",
    "we will represent the apparent boost that power - law photons receive from relativistic effects by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the angle ( measured in the observer s frame ) between the direction of the electron bulk motion and the direction of radiation , and we have assumed a value @xmath35 for the photon spectral index . for the geometry described above , @xmath49 .",
    "table  [ tab : beta ] also indicates the values for @xmath48 at the various torus positions .    to calculate @xmath43",
    ", one needs to consider the relative brightnesses of the regions .",
    "there are difficulties when one tries to compare region @xmath50 to region @xmath51 and region @xmath52 to region @xmath53 .",
    "according to this simple model , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( and also @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) should be essentially identical regions , since they are roughly equally spaced from the toroidal axis on the front ( rear ) side of the torus .",
    "inspection of table  [ tab : beta ] shows that they are not the same , and trying to solve for @xmath43 for these combinations produces negative results .",
    "therefore , we disregard these values and average the rest to determine @xmath54 , which we adopt for the remainder of this discussion . assuming that the injected electron spectrum remains constant , there are two ways to produce changes in the relativistic boost @xmath46 , namely change @xmath48 or change @xmath43 .",
    "we will investigate each of these possibilities .",
    "a change in @xmath48 really would mean that the orientation of the torus had changed or that the orientation of the injected relativistic wind had changed . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider the case where the torus remains rigid and centered on the pulsar .",
    "the projection of the torus onto the plane of the sky is characterized by two angles .",
    "one angle determines the azimuthal orientation of the major axis of the projected ellipse .",
    "varying this angle corresponds to a rotation of the projected ellipse in the plane of the sky . during our image alignment",
    "we would have removed any rotations of this sort , and therefore a variation of the azimuthal orientation of the projected ellipse can not be a cause of the observed changes .",
    "the angle that is critical for changing the boosting factor is the angle of inclination between the torus and our line of sight .",
    "we will refer to the angle as @xmath55 and note that we have used @xmath56 in previous discussions .",
    "if we allow @xmath55 to vary , this will produce a change in @xmath48 determined by @xmath57 . substituting this value for @xmath58 into equation  [ eqn : rel_boost ] and differentiating , we find that the fractional change in the relativistic boost is given by @xmath59 assuming that changes in @xmath55 and @xmath46 are small",
    ", we can use @xmath60 and @xmath61 to calculate the necessary change in @xmath55 to produce the observed variation in brightness in a given region .",
    "if we try this for region w ( from table  [ tab : beta_change ] , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) we find that @xmath64 .",
    "this value may at first seem quite large , but one must recall that the torus has a width of 15  to 20  ( aschenbach & brinkmann 1975 , hester et al .",
    "thus , it is possible to imagine that the plane of the wind s bulk motion is varying at an amplitude that is comparable to the width of the torus .    if we extend this analysis to other regions , we encounter difficulties  most notably at region sw and region ne .",
    "since these two regions essentially lie along the major axis of the projected ellipse we should see very little variation in their brightness if @xmath55 changes .",
    "in fact , for sw , we actually see the greatest amount of change , and the @xmath65 required to produce it is unreasonably large . for this reason",
    ", it seems unlikely that the changes observed are due to variations in the orientations of the wind plane .",
    "now , let us consider the effects of a changing @xmath43 on @xmath46 .",
    "if we follow the same procedure as used above , we find that @xmath66      \\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta } = q(\\theta,\\beta )      \\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}. \\label{eqn : delta_beta}\\ ] ]    from figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] , we estimate the fractional change in the brightness ( @xmath67 ) of each of the torus regions ( table  [ tab : beta_change ] ) . for regions",
    "n and s , these values should only be taken as very rough estimates , since their behavior is not well - defined . using these values and",
    "the values for @xmath48 indicated in table  [ tab : beta ] we calculate the required fractional change in @xmath43 , and these values are presented in table  [ tab : beta_change ] .",
    "we should point out that there is no solution for @xmath68 if @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 , meaning @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) .",
    "at these locations @xmath73 , regardless of the change in @xmath43 , and furthermore , for a given change in @xmath43 these angles define regions where @xmath74 changes sign ( see figure  [ fig : explanation ] ) .",
    "another point to note is that the calculated value of @xmath68 is very sensitive to the angle used when @xmath75 .",
    "all the regions except region s require a decrease in the value of @xmath43 .",
    "region s may be complicated by the fact that it lies near the southern outflow , and so it is likely a combination of toroidal and jet emission .",
    "the same thing could be said about region n and region w , but in the north , the rotational pole is likely to point away while the torus is inclined toward the observer .",
    "beaming effects should mean that the torus dominates in the north , and , likewise , the jet could be dominant in the south .",
    "region sw is also problematic , because @xmath76 , using @xmath77 .",
    "using other values of @xmath48 near 90  only makes matters worse .    keeping these difficulties in mind",
    ", it is still intriguing that the computed @xmath68 is the same order of magnitude for regions at various locations on the torus that have different magnitudes and different directions of brightness change . at least in a qualitative manner ,",
    "a decrease in @xmath43 of @xmath7820% can explain the changes seen here .",
    "the possibilities discussed above have neglected possible changes in the photon or electron spectra .",
    "such changes could be caused by variations in the emitted flux , changes in the spectral index , differences in absorbing neutral hydrogen along the line of sight , or a combination of all three .",
    "if one keeps the unabsorbed energy flux in the rosat hri energy band constant , assumes @xmath79 @xmath80 , and simply varies the photon index , the photon flux can vary sharply . changing the photon index @xmath81 by @xmath82 results in @xmath83 changes in the observed hri count rate . if we fix @xmath33 and vary @xmath84 we find that to produce a 10% change in count rate , the @xmath84 must change by @xmath85 @xmath80 .",
    "so , it would be possible to vary the spectral parameters to produce a change in the observed count rate , but , once again , the orchestration of these parameter changes as a function of position seems to require some complicated maneuvering to match the observations .",
    "although it seems to us that the best way to explain our observations is that @xmath43 of the bulk particle motion has changed by @xmath86 from 1991 to 1997 , there still remain some difficulties with this explanation .",
    "first , if @xmath43 has changed by so much , we might expect to be able to repeat our @xmath43 determination for the 1991 and 1997 observations and detect a difference .",
    "unfortunately , for reasons discussed above , determining @xmath43 is not a straightforward process . if we do apply the method previously described , we compute @xmath87 for both 1991 and 1997 , where the quoted error is the standard deviation .",
    "any 20% variation is lost in the large uncertainty .",
    "it is also not clear how such a large change in @xmath43 would be produced .",
    "an intriguing possibility would be that this is related to a decrease in the speed of the relativistic wind produced by the pulsar .",
    "several authors have estimated that the maximum speed that the pulsar can impart to the electrons varies with the pulsar period ( e.g. goldreich & julian 1969 , ostriker & gunn 1969 ) .",
    "these are pre - shock speeds , and our observations are sensitive to the electrons after they have passed through the shock .",
    "therefore , we have to relate the post - shock @xmath43 to the pre - shock @xmath43 . for ultra - relativistic motions , blandford & rees ( 1974 )",
    "have shown that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the velocity and @xmath90 is the pressure in the indicated region . for a strong shock @xmath91 . if this is the only effect on the pulsar wind , then , with @xmath92 , that would indicate that @xmath93 , which is significantly less than expected .",
    "moreover , a fractional change in @xmath94 requires the same fractional change in @xmath95 . if this were true , then @xmath95 would have to have dropped to @xmath96 , meaning that the energy contained in the particle wind had decreased by @xmath97 . even if only a small fraction of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity is fed into the relativistic wind , this is still a considerable change .",
    "instead of originating from the pulsar , the observed changes could stem from variations in the shock boundary .",
    "this would eliminate the need for such a large change in the pre - shock relativistic wind speed .",
    "in addition , it could provide a simple explanation for the observed spread in the derived @xmath68 for the various regions , a quantity which is related to the magnitude of brightness variation , as well as the time scale similarities between the regions .",
    "the magnitude of the variations could be dominated by local parameters such as density , pressure , or magnetic field strength , while the time scale for variation is a global property that depends on the speed at which a perturbation is transmitted .",
    "this speed could conceivably be the relativistic wind , sound , or alfvn speed .",
    "with rosat hri observations from 1991 to 1997 , we have detected significant but localized changes in the x - ray emission of the crab nebula .",
    "if the increased brightness of the northwest portion of the torus is due to relativistic beaming , the variations can be explained , in a general sense , as being due to a @xmath86 decrease in the post - shock bulk motion .",
    "why there should be such a large decrease is not known at this time , but it seems unlikely that it can be explained by a decrease in the @xmath43 of the pre - shock relativistic wind .",
    "we expect that this decrease in @xmath43 can not continue for long .",
    "if it maintains this rate of decrease , @xmath43 will drop to zero rather rapidly .",
    "it seems likely that what we are observing is some transient behavior of the nebula , and that there is a `` recovery '' mechanism which will bring the @xmath43 factor back to a larger value . with continuing observations we will be able to better understand the nature of these changes and the properties of the pulsar wind and its shock .",

    "<S> a comparison of the observations reveals that there are significant ( @xmath0 ) differences in the emission from the nebula at a rate of @xmath1year . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are confined to rather large ( @xmath2 ) , well - defined regions . </S>",
    "<S> one region is coincident with the end of the southern polar outflow , while the others are coincident with the torus surrounding the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> the various regions have different time histories , but they generally show a monotonic change in count rate , some increasing and others decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for the observed behavior is that the radial bulk motion of the relativistic wind after shock passage has slowed by 10 to 20 % over the six years of observations . </S>"
