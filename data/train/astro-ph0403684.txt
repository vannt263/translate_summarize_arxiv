    "the environs of the b8 star @xmath0 cha and the dark cloud mbm  12 have been revealed as sites of small associations of newly formed stars . through deep _ rosat _ observations of 0.35  deg@xmath1 toward @xmath0 cha , @xcite discovered x - ray emission from 12 sources , including @xmath0 cha itself . from _ hipparcos _",
    "parallactic distances and proper motions , the two earliest stellar counterparts and an early - type star without x - ray emission were found to be comoving at a distance of @xmath5  pc .",
    "@xcite confirmed the youth of the remaining 10 late - type stars through measurements of h@xmath6 emission and li absorption , which indicated their probable membership in an association with the early - type stars .",
    "an age of 4 - 10 myr has been inferred for these stars through comparisons of their positions on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram to theoretical isochrones @xcite .",
    "recently , five additional low - mass members of the association ( 0.08 - 0.3  @xmath4 ) have been identified through spectroscopy of candidates appearing in color - magnitude diagrams generated from photometry at @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite and from data in the usno - b1 and two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogs @xcite .",
    "although not precisely determined , the completeness limits of these latest surveys appeared to be near 0.1  @xmath4 .",
    "surveys for sources of h@xmath6 and x - ray emission toward cloud 12 from @xcite ( mbm  12 ) have resulted in the discovery of seven t tauri stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mbm  12 was long believed to be the nearest molecular cloud at a distance of 50 - 100 pc @xcite , making the associated group of young stars ( mbm  12a ) a particularly attractive site for studies of star formation . however , during a search for new members , @xcite noticed that the members of mbm  12a exhibited anomalously old ages ( @xmath5  myr ) when placed on the h - r diagram with the published distances . through",
    "new distance estimates in that work and subsequent studies @xcite , the distance of mbm  12 cloud is now firmly established near a value of @xmath9  pc . using this distance , theoretical isochrones",
    "produce an age of @xmath10  myr , which is consistent with the evolutionary state of the association implied by various signatures of newly formed stars @xcite .",
    "the magnitude - limited survey by @xcite achieved a completeness limit of 0.03  @xmath4 and uncovered five new members ( 0.1 - 0.4  @xmath4 ) , bringing the total known membership to a dozen sources at a resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite have since identified four  probable \" members of mbm  12a via h@xmath6 emission detected with slitless grism spectroscopy .    in this paper",
    ", we present spectroscopy of candidate members of the @xmath0  cha and mbm  12 associations . for @xmath0  cha",
    ", we select candidate members of the association by combining @xmath3 photometry from the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) and @xmath2 data from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) (   [ sec : ident1 ] ) , measure their spectral types and determine their status as field stars or association members (   [ sec : class1 ] ) , evaluate the completeness of the survey (   [ sec : complete ] ) , and place the known members of @xmath0  cha on the h - r diagram (   [ sec : hr ] ) . for mbm  12a ,",
    "we select candidate members from @xcite and @xcite for spectroscopy (   [ sec : ident2 ] ) and use these data to measure spectral types and assess membership (   [ sec : class2 ] ) .",
    "to search for new members of a stellar group , one can select stars that exhibit the colors and magnitudes expected of members in color - color and color - magnitude diagrams and obtain followup spectroscopy to distinguish between field stars and bonafide members . for our survey of @xmath0  cha",
    ", we utilized @xmath3 photometry from the denis second release and @xmath2 photometry from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "these surveys exhibit a signal - to - noise of 10 at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we considered all sources appearing in both databases within a radius of @xmath16 from @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the size of this survey field was selected to extend well beyond the positions of the known members of the association .",
    "two areas within this radius were not available from the denis second release .",
    "they are defined approximately by @xmath19 to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting survey field has a size of 0.7  deg@xmath1 and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "these data are shown on the diagram of @xmath22 versus @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : ik ] .",
    "we also include the 10  myr isochrone from @xcite for masses of 0.015 to 1  @xmath4 at a distance of 97  pc @xcite .",
    "this isochrone was converted to photometric magnitudes from predicted effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities in the manner described by @xcite . to separate candidate members of @xmath0  cha from likely field stars , we defined a boundary that is below this isochrone . to account for the larger photometric errors that would be exhibited by any members at the faintest levels",
    ", we placed the boundary at a larger distance below the isochrone at lower masses . above this boundary , there are 22 stars that are not previously known members .",
    "we selected 16 of these candidates for spectroscopy . among the six remaining sources , three stars were already classified as field giants by @xcite .",
    "the other three candidates , 2mass  j08501189 - 7844236 , j08382996 - 7924507 , and j08501972 - 7906344 , were not observed because they are likely to be field giants according to their @xmath24 and @xmath25 colors , as shown in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] .",
    "the 12 known members at k and m spectral types were included in our spectroscopic sample as well .",
    "table  [ tab : log1 ] summarizes long - slit spectroscopy of these 28 targets . the observing and data reduction procedures are the same as those described by @xcite .",
    "we measured spectral types and assessed membership for the 16 candidate members of @xmath0  cha by applying the methods of classification described by @xcite for a similar set of data in chamaeleon  i. in this way , we classified 13 candidates as field dwarfs and background giants .",
    "astrometry , photometry , and spectral types for these sources are listed in table  [ tab : back ] .",
    "we also include the three field stars identified spectroscopically by @xcite . among the three remaining candidates ,",
    "source 16 has emission in h@xmath6 ( @xmath26   ) that is above the levels observed for active field dwarfs @xcite and emission in he  i at 6678   .",
    "although emission lines of this kind can arise from flaring field dwarfs , the low duty cycle of such flares @xcite combined with the presence of these strong lines during the separate observations in this work and in @xcite indicates that the emission source is probably a young star rather than a flaring field dwarf .",
    "the spectra of this object and the other two remaining candidates exhibit conclusive evidence of youth , and thus membership in @xmath0  cha , in the form of the weak k  i and na  i absorption features that are characteristic of pre - main - sequence objects @xcite .",
    "these three new members were independently discovered in the survey by @xcite .",
    "sources 17 and 18 were also reported by @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the three new members and the 12 previously known late - type members are presented in figure  [ fig : ec ] .",
    "astrometry , photometry , spectral types , and evidence of membership for the 18 known members of @xmath0  cha are compiled in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "the @xmath8 photometry from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite agree with the @xmath3 data from denis for most of the members of @xmath0  cha with the exception of the third brightest member , source 13 ( hd  75505 ) , for which @xmath3 is fainter than @xmath8 .",
    "the two brightest stars , sources 2 and 8 ( @xmath0  cha and rs  cha ) were not measured at @xmath8 , but their @xmath3 data are also much fainter than expected relative to the ir photometry from 2mass .",
    "therefore , the denis @xmath3 measurements for these three members are not included in table  [ tab : mem ] .      because low - mass , cool sources are most easily detected at near - ir wavelengths , we use the diagram of @xmath25 versus @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : hk ] to evaluate the mass completeness of our survey for new members of @xmath0  cha .",
    "the completeness limits of the 2mass photometry are taken to be the magnitudes at which the logarithm of the number of sources as a function of magnitude departs from a linear slope and begins to turn over ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . without quantitative support , @xcite asserted that late - m members of @xmath0  cha are not detectable with data from 2mass . however , according to the evolutionary models of @xcite , the completeness limits of the 2mass data correspond to a mass of @xmath29  @xmath4 and a spectral type of @xmath30l0 for objects at the age and distance of the association ( 6  myr , 97  pc ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hk ] , we have plotted the theoretical isochrone from @xcite for 10  myr , which is near the upper limit we find for the age of the @xmath0  cha association (   [ sec : hr ] ) .",
    "we have omitted the field stars identified with spectroscopy as well as objects that are probable field stars by their location below the boundary in figure  [ fig : ik ] .",
    "the three stars lacking spectroscopy that were identified as likely field giants by figure  [ fig : jhhk ] are also excluded .",
    "the remaining ir sources consist of known members of the association and objects that were not detected at @xmath3 by denis .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : hk ] , our search for new members is complete to masses of 0.015  @xmath4 , which is near the deuterium burning mass limit @xcite .      in this section , we estimate effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the members of @xmath0  cha , place these data on the h - r diagram , and use theoretical evolutionary models to infer masses and ages .    in the following analysis ,",
    "standard dwarf colors are taken from the compilation of @xcite for types earlier than m0 and from the young disk populations described by @xcite for types of m0 and later .",
    "the ir colors from @xcite are transformed from the johnson - glass photometric system to the cit system @xcite .",
    "near - ir colors in the 2mass and cit photometric systems agree at a level of @xmath31  mag @xcite .    to estimate the amount of extinction toward each member of @xmath0  cha , @xcite compared the @xmath32 color from @xcite to the value for a dwarf at the published spectral type of that source .",
    "the resulting extinctions ranged from @xmath33 to 0.8 .",
    "however , when we include @xmath34 and @xmath35 in this analysis and use the spectral types measured in this work , we arrive at extinctions that are close to zero for most of the members .",
    "a comparison of our spectra to the estimates of unreddened spectra of young stars from @xcite also indicates essentially no extinction , with a firm limit of @xmath36 for most members .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath33 when computing bolometric luminosities from the observed photometry .",
    "the one exception is source 13 ( hd  75505 ) , whose optical colors do imply a non - zero extinction of @xmath37 .",
    "spectral types of m0 and earlier are converted to effective temperatures with the dwarf temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "for spectral types later than m0 , we use the temperature scale that was designed by @xcite to be compatible with the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bolometric luminosities are estimated by combining @xmath38-band measurements , a distance of 97  pc , and bolometric corrections described in @xcite .",
    "the combined uncertainties in @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and bc@xmath40 ( @xmath41 , 0.03 , 0.1 ) correspond to errors of @xmath42 in the relative values of log  @xmath43 .",
    "when an uncertainty in the distance modulus is included ( @xmath44 ) , the total uncertainties are @xmath45 .",
    "the temperatures and luminosities of the components of the binary system source 8 ( rs cha ) are from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "two additional known binaries among the members of @xmath0  cha are sources 1 and 9 @xcite .",
    "the luminosities plotted on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] are corrected for the contribution of the secondary by assuming that for each system the ratio of the luminosities is equal to the ratio the @xmath46-band fluxes from @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the luminosities in table  [ tab : mem ] are uncorrected and reflect the total system photometry . the effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities , and adopted spectral types for the members of @xmath0  cha are listed in table  [ tab : mem ] .    the temperatures and luminosities for the members of @xmath0  cha can be interpreted in terms of masses and ages with theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "after considering the available sets of models , @xcite concluded that those of @xcite for @xmath47 and @xcite and @xcite for @xmath48 provided the best agreement with observational constraints .",
    "the known members of @xmath0  cha are plotted with these models on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "one member , source 12 , appears overluminous compared to the other sources and thus may be an unresolved binarity .",
    "otherwise , the remaining members form a relatively narrow , well - defined sequence that is parallel to the model isochrones and is consistent with a single age of @xmath49  myr for all members .",
    "this age agrees within the uncertainties with previous estimates by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to the h - r diagram and evolutionary models in figure  [ fig : hr ] , the three newly discovered members of @xmath0  cha have masses of 0.08 - 0.13  @xmath4 , and thus are just above and straddling the hydrogen burning mass limit .",
    "we now examine the implications of our survey of the @xmath0  cha association .",
    "we have identified three new members just above the hydrogen burning limit , but have found no objects at lower masses down to the completeness limit of 0.015  @xmath4 .",
    "is this result consistent with the mass functions measured in younger , star - forming clusters ? in taurus and ic  348 , the ratio of the number of brown dwarfs at 0.02 - 0.08  @xmath4 to the number of stars has been measured to be 0.13 @xcite .",
    "if this ratio applies to @xmath0  cha , then we would expect to find only 2.3 substellar members in this mass range .",
    "therefore , the lack of any detected brown dwarfs does not comprise a statistically significant difference from mass functions in these two populations .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath0  cha does appear to differ at a modestly significant level from the trapezium cluster in orion , which exhibits a frequency of brown dwarfs that is about twice the value found in taurus and ic  348 @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : map ] , the three members of @xmath0  cha with the lowest masses do have the largest angular separations from the center of the association , which is suggestive of mass segregation and could indicate that substellar members of the association are preferentially located in the outskirts of the association and beyond our survey field .",
    "the possibility of the formation of a low - mass halo in @xmath0  cha through dynamical evolution was discussed by @xcite . a survey like the one performed in this work for a larger area toward @xmath0",
    "cha would provide a test of this scenario .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite predicted the presence of at least 20 undiscovered members at masses of 0.025 - 0.15  @xmath4 based on an extrapolation of the imf of the known members .",
    "however , we demonstrate that only one new member beyond the census of @xcite is present in this mass range .",
    "in a recent search for members of mbm  12a , @xcite identified four objects as probable members of the association through slitless grism spectroscopy .",
    "two of these sources were in the spectroscopic sample of @xcite and the other two stars are included in our sample here . at",
    "the end of the survey for new members of mbm  12a by @xcite , there remained six candidates that had not been observed spectroscopically . in this work , we selected the three brightest candidates for spectroscopy , 2mass  j02524907 + 1952523 , j02585238 + 1958402 , and j02583445 + 1946506 . to facilitate the classification of the spectra of the candidates",
    ", we also observed the known member mbm  12a-3 .",
    "table  [ tab : log2 ] summarizes our long - slit spectroscopy of these targets .",
    "@xcite obtained slitless grism spectroscopy toward the mbm  12 cloud and identified four stars as  probable \" members of mbm  12a on the basis of emission in h@xmath6 .",
    "however , h@xmath6 emission also occurs in field dwarfs and thus can serve as evidence of youth and membership only if it is above the levels observed in active dwarfs .",
    "for instance , the equivalent widths from @xcite for three of the four sources are less than 10   , which is within the range observed for field m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for h@xmath6 in the fourth star , they report an equivalent width of 56.4    while we measure only 10   .",
    "we suggest that the measurement from @xcite is either spurious or obtained during a flare . in summary , the h@xmath6 strengths for these four sources are consistent with both field dwarfs and young members of mbm  12a , and hence can not be used to assess membership in the association .    to conclusively determine the membership of the four objects from @xcite",
    ", we checked for the presence of strong li absorption at 6707   , which is a signature of youth .",
    "prior to the study of @xcite , two of the four candidates therein , 2mass  j02553502 + 2006484 ( byu-1 ) and 2mass  j02575018 + 1958302 ( byu-4 ) , already had been classified as field dwarfs through spectroscopy of li by @xcite .",
    "those data exhibit a clear absence of li absorption , as shown in figure  [ fig : li ] , where a spectrum of the known member mbm  12a-3 obtained with the same instrument configuration is included for comparison .",
    "similarly , li absorption is not present in the spectra obtained in this work for the other two sources from @xcite , 2mass  j02562431 + 2035117 ( byu-2 ) and 2mass  j02573101 + 1943459 ( byu-3 ) .",
    "membership in mbm  12a for these two stars would have been somewhat surprising given their location below the boundary in the @xmath35 versus @xmath8 diagram from @xcite , which is the reason they were not observed spectroscopically or listed as candidates in that work .",
    "@xcite found that the optical and near - ir colors of 2mass  j02524907 + 1952523 , j02583445 + 1946506 , and j02585238 + 1958402 were consistent with those of unreddened stars at spectral types of m4 to m5 , either foreground dwarfs or young members of mbm  12a . from the spectra collected for these objects",
    ", we have measured spectral types of m3.5v , m4.75v , and m4.75-m5v , which are in agreement with the estimates from the photometry .",
    "given the lack of li absorption in the spectra in figure  [ fig : li ] , we classify these stars as field dwarfs .",
    "we have performed spectroscopic studies of candidate members of the @xmath0  cha and mbm  12a young associations , the conclusions for which are summarized as follows :    for @xmath0  cha , we have used @xmath2 photometry from 2mass and @xmath3 photometry from denis to construct color - color and color - magnitude diagrams for an area of 0.7  deg@xmath1 . through spectroscopy of the candidate members appearing in these data , we have discovered three new members of the association with spectral types of m5.25-m5.75 , corresponding to masses of 0.13 - 0.08  @xmath4 according to evolutionary models .",
    "these sources were independently found in recent work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "no brown dwarfs were detected in @xmath0  cha down to the completeness limit of 0.015  @xmath4 for our survey , which is roughly consistent with the yield of @xmath10 substellar members expected if the relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs in @xmath0  cha are similar to those of the taurus and ic  348 star - forming regions . on the other hand , the fact that the three least massive members of the association are the outermost members may indicate that the substellar members are preferentially located at large distances from the center of the association and outside of our survey field .",
    "for the 18 known members of @xmath0  cha , we have estimated bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures and placed the members on the h - r diagram , from which we infer an age of @xmath49  myr for the association with the evolutionary models of @xcite .    for mbm  12a ,",
    "we have presented spectra of three of the remaining candidate members that lacked spectroscopy at the end of the survey by @xcite and of the four  probable \" members from @xcite .",
    "we classify all of these sources as field dwarfs based on the absence of li absorption in their spectra .",
