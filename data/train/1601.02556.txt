    "<S>  strongly interacting many - body systems exhibit rich physics , but in general pose as tremendous theoretical challenges . under certain circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> a system can be mapped into another one much more amenable to theoretical study . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - fermi mapping is one such example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it maps a system of one dimensional ( 1d ) spinless bosons with infinite repulsive two - body contact interaction to a system of spinless non - interacting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind it is that for @xmath2 identical particles , the wave function in one spatial sector @xmath3 contains complete information about the total wave function . </S>",
    "<S> due to the infinite interaction , the relative wave function between two identical bosons must vanish when @xmath4 , which mimics the quantum statistics between two identical fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping was later generalized by cheon and shegehara @xcite who mapped a system of spinless bosons with @xmath0-wave contact interaction characterized by strength @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 to a system of spinless fermions interacting with each other via a short - range @xmath1-wave interaction of strengh @xmath7 , whose pseudo - potential form can be written as @xcite @xmath8 this idea was further developed by girardeau and olshanii @xcite who showed that 1d spinor fermi gas and bose gas can be mapped into each other , where the even - wave interaction ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) in one is mapped to the odd - wave interaction ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) in the other . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the even relative spatial wave function under @xmath9 and the odd relative spatial wave function under @xmath10 satisfy exactly the same boundary condition : @xmath11    motivated by these past works , here we present a different , but related , mapping as follows : a 1d spinor gas , either bosonic or fermionic , interacting with contact @xmath0-wave two - body interaction , governed by hamiltonian @xmath12 + v_s \\,,\\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the single - body hamiltonian with @xmath14 representing the external trapping potential , can be mapped to the direct product of a spinless @xmath1-wave interacting fermi gas and a spin chain system under the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 note that this mapping is defined in one spatial sector set by @xmath17 , which is the sector function ( i.e. , generalized heaviside step function ) of spatial coordinates , whose value is one in spatial sector @xmath18 , and zero in any other spatial sectors . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath19 are spin projection operators that project out symmetric and antisymmetric spin states , respectively , where @xmath20 is the exchange operator that exchanges the @xmath21 and @xmath22 spins . </S>",
    "<S> if the original spinor gas is bosonic ( fermionic ) , one should take @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping is possible as the parity of the relative spatial wave function of two identical particles is directly linked to the exchange symmetry of their spin wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this mapping is exact and valid for arbitrary values of @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is particularly useful for strongly interacting systems with large @xmath5 , for which the spatial wave function of the mapped system is that of a weakly interacting @xmath1-wave spinless fermi gas , which can be calculated perturbatively . in the following , we will present a more detailed study of such a system . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the study of the dynamical properties , which has largely been neglected in previous works .    </S>",
    "<S> _ multi - branch spin chain model . </S>",
    "<S> _  we now consider a trapped spinor gas with @xmath2 total atoms governed by hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> although our theory is valid for arbitrary @xmath14 , we will focus on harmonic trapping potential @xmath26 , which not only is the most experimentally relevant , but also possesses special symmetry properties that we will exploit later . </S>",
    "<S> we have adopted a dimensionless unit system where @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the atomic mass and the trap frequency , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction hamiltonian of the mapped system is given by @xmath30 in ( [ pesudopotential ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath5 , we work on this mapped system , and treat @xmath30 as a perturbation to the single - body hamiltonian @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed system is simply an ideal fermi gas , whose ground state is formed by putting one atom in each of the lowest @xmath2 single - body states , as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , we can readily derive an effective hamiltonian : @xmath34 with the coefficients @xmath35 given by @xmath36 this is exactly the inhomogeneous spin chain hamiltonian for a 1d strongly interacting quantum gas that has been derived very recently by several groups using different methods @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> previous works have established that the spin chain model represented by hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) describes rather accurately many of the ground state properties of the original strongly interacting spinor gas to order @xmath7 . in order to provide a more complete description of the system , and </S>",
    "<S> in particular of the _ dynamical _ properties of the system , we now extend the calculation to include excited eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath13 to construct a multi - branch spin chain model .    </S>",
    "<S> the excited eigenstates of the non - interacting system governed by @xmath13 can be easily constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited state , with wave function denoted as @xmath37 and represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , is obtained by promoting the atom at the fermi level in the ground state @xmath32 to the next single - particle state . for harmonic traps with equal spacing single - particle energy levels , the second excited state , as represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) , is two - fold degenerate with wave functions denoted as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can now carry out a similar first - order perturbation calculation and construct the corresponding spin - chain hamiltonian for each excited manifold . </S>",

    "<S> is no longer a pure spin hamiltonian , as we now have two spatial wave functions @xmath48 , which leads to a spin - orbit coupling between the spatial and the spin sectors .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , one can construct the effective hamiltonian for any other excited manifold in a similar manner as long as we plug in the corresponding slater determinant(s ) to evaluate the coefficients @xmath49 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the special symmetry properties of harmonic trapping potential allows us to write down the spin chain model for low - lying excited manifolds from that of the ground state spin chain hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) without any extra calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this also provides significant insights into the low - lying collective excitation modes for harmonically trapped spinor quantum gases .    </S>",
    "<S> _ symmetry properties of harmonic trap . _ </S>",
    "<S>  consider first an ideal gas of harmonically trapped @xmath2 spinless fermions under hamiltonian @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the center - of - mass ( com ) motion can be separated from the relative internal motion . </S>",
    "<S> the com dipole mode can be excited by the operator @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the com position and momentum operators , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the detailed definition and properties of these operators , see supplemental material @xcite . ) on the other hand , one can also construct an operator @xmath53 which excites a breathing mode which is an excitation in the internal motion . </S>",
    "<S> we can further define the internal hamiltonian as @xmath54 , which together with @xmath55 and @xmath53 form a closed so(2,1 ) algebra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the internal states can then be classified into irreducible representations of this so(2,1 ) algebra . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited state @xmath37 , represented by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , represents the lowest com dipole excitation and is generated from the ground state @xmath32 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) by applying @xmath56 once , i.e. , @xmath57 . whereas the second excited manifold can be generated from the ground state in two different ways : @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the second com dipole excitation and @xmath60 the first internal breathing excitation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 and @xmath60 have the same energy and are in fact linear superpositions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 represented by fig .  [ fig1](c ) </S>",
    "<S> by repeatedly applying @xmath56 and @xmath53 to the ground state , we can generate two families of excited states correspond to the com dipole excitations and intenal breathing excitations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in our dimensionless units , the @xmath61 com dipole mode @xmath62 has excitation frequency @xmath63 , and the @xmath61 internal breathing mode @xmath64 has excitation frequency @xmath65 .    for the mapping we discussed earlier , the charge degrees of freedom of a strongly interacting harmonically trapped spinor gas is mapped to a spinless fermi gas interacting with the @xmath1-wave pseudo - potential @xmath30 given in eq .  ( [ pesudopotential ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath30 only affects in the internal degrees of freedom , the separation of the com motion and internal motion discussed above remains valid . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate conclusion one can draw is that @xmath30 would not affect the energies of the com dipole states generated by @xmath56 as @xmath66=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the com dipole excitation frequencies are not shifted by the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this is simply the manifestation of the kohn - sham theorem for a system of harmoincally trapped particles . </S>",
    "<S> a direct consequence of this is that the coefficients in the spin chain hamiltonian @xmath67 for the first excited state ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h1 ] ) ) are the same as the corresponding coefficients in @xmath68 for the ground state ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ heff ] ) ) , i.e. , @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the two spin - chain hamiltonians , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , only differ by a constant shift of @xmath70 , which is the frequency of the lowest com dipole mode .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us turn to the second excited manifold which contains two degenerate states @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qb ] ) . due to the fact that @xmath56 is a com operator , and </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath53 and @xmath30 affect only the internal motion , the interaction does not couple @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> we can write down the effective spin chain hamiltonians for these two states separately : @xmath71 furthermore , for the same reason that @xmath69 , we also have @xmath72 . hence @xmath73 and @xmath68 also differ only by a constant shift of @xmath74 , which is the frequency of the second com dipole mode . </S>",
    "<S> quite amazingly , there also exists a simple relation between @xmath75 and @xmath35 which can be proved using a recursion relation for the so(2,1 ) algebra @xcite : @xmath76 which means that @xmath77 and @xmath68 , apart from a constant shift of @xmath74 , only differ by a constant factor given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ factor ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference between the ground states of @xmath77 and @xmath68 , which gives the frequency of the lowest breathing mode @xmath78 , is therefore @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ground state energy of the spin chain hamiltonian @xmath68 measured with respect to @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , unlike the com dipole mode , the breathing mode frequency receives an interaction - dependent shift away from the non - interacting value of 2 . in the strongly interaction regime , this shift @xmath82 and vanishes exactly in the tg limit of @xmath33 .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath78 is completely determined by the ground state energy of the spin chain hamiltonian @xmath68 . for a system of spinor bose gas with _ </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary _ spin and arbitrary population distribution among spin components , it is quite obvious that the ground state of @xmath68 is obtained by arranging the atoms into a fully spin symmetric configuration such that @xmath83 , and correspondingly the ground state energy is given by @xmath84 which , for a given trapping potential , only depends on the total number of atoms @xmath2 . under the local density approximation ( lda ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can obtain semi - analytic expressions for @xmath35 , from which , we can show @xcite that , for @xmath85 @xmath86 which is consistent with the result obtained previously for spinless bosons near the tg limit @xcite . correspondingly , the interaction - induced shift of the breathing mode frequency is @xmath87    the fermionic case is more complicated . for a spin-@xmath0 fermi gas with a fully spin antisymmetric configuration , its ground state energy is the same as in the bosonic case , given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , we calculated the interaction - induced shift of the lowest breathing mode frequency , which is directly related to the ground state energy under the spin chain model , as well as the quench dynamics of a spin-1/2 fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> our work demonstrates that the multi - branch spin chain model can accurately capture both the static and the dynamical properties of the system .    </S>",
