    "for a wide range of quantum - mechanical systems , the entire electronic system can conveniently be split into a set of electron groups ( eg ) such as core and valence electrons in molecules or crystals , electrons on atoms or ions in atomic or ionic solids , core and bond electrons in strongly covalent materials , etc .",
    "similar partitioning ideas can also be applied to separate electrons in a cluster and environment regions to derive a particular embedding potential for the quantum cluster @xcite .",
    "provided that the partition scheme applied to the given system is physically ( or chemically ) appropriate , one can assume that electrons fixed to the given group spend most of their time at this group .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation , the wavefunction of the whole system consisting of electronic groups @xmath8 can be represented as an antisymmetrised product of wavefunctions @xmath9 of every individual group:@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of eg s . here",
    "the @xmath8-th group is associated with @xmath12 electrons which coordinates are collected into a set @xmath13 .",
    "note that the single electron coordinates @xmath14 include the spin coordinate @xmath15 as well .",
    "the antisymmetrisation operator is defined via@xmath16 where the sum runs over all @xmath17 permutations @xmath18 of the complete group of permutations @xmath19 , the total number of electrons in the whole system being @xmath20 and the factor @xmath21 according to the parity of the permutation @xmath18 .",
    "it is assumed here that the group functions @xmath9 are already individually antisymmetric .    by applying expression ( [ eq : operator - a ] ) for the operator @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : total - psi ] ) , one obtains an expansion of the wavefunction via various functions - products .",
    "when used in calculating matrix elements @xmath0 of symmetrical ( with respect to permutations of electronic coordinates ) operators @xmath23 ( e.g. an external field or electron - electron interaction ) , a corresponding expansion of matrix elements between various functions - products is obtained .",
    "earlier attempts ( see , e.g. @xcite ) to simplify the expansion and associate each term with a transparent diagram have been generalised in refs .",
    "@xcite where the arrow diagram ( ad ) theory was developed .",
    "firstly , by exploiting a double - coset decomposition of the group @xmath19 , many terms in the expansion were found to be identical and the corresponding rules to number all distinct terms were worked out in a general case .",
    "secondly , each distinct term in the expansion was given by a well - defined picture ( arrow diagram ) which allowed to construct simple rules to associate an analytical expression with any of the ad s .",
    "the theory was formulated in a very general way for arbitrary number of electron groups and explicit ad expansions were constructed for reduced density matrices ( rdm ) @xcite of orders one and two ( rdm-1 and rdm-2 ) .",
    "these enable one to calculate matrix elements of arbitrary symmetrical one- and two - particle operators and are thus sufficient in most cases relevant to quantum chemistry of molecules and solids ( generalisation to higher order rdm s is cumbersome but straightforward ) .",
    "in general , the success of this technique depends crucially on the value of the overlap between different group functions @xmath9 and thus their localisation in certain _ regions _ of space ( also known as _ structure elements _",
    "this is because greater localisation of the group functions results in better convergence of the ad expansion , i.e. smaller number of terms in the expansion are to be retained . that is why the choice of electronic groups and appropriate regions of their localisation @xcite is so important for this method to work .",
    "although the ad theory formulated in @xcite is applicable to any system consisting of arbitrary number of overlapping electron groups , one can not directly use it to describe an extended ( in particular , infinite ) system . indeed , to calculate an observable @xmath24 of the operator @xmath1 , in the case of an extended system one has to calculate the ratio of two ad expansions , one arising from the matrix element @xmath25 and another - from the normalisation integral @xmath6 .",
    "both expansions contain very many terms ; in fact , the number of terms is infinite in the case of an infinite system ( e.g. a solid ) .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the normalisation integral @xmath26 tends to infinity with the number of electronic groups @xmath11 .",
    "this assertion made it possible to prove the so - called linked ad theorem @xcite .",
    "it states that the observable @xmath27 , i.e. it is equal to the ad expansion for the matrix element @xmath25 of the operator @xmath1 , in which only linked ( connected ) ads are retained ( subscript `` c '' ) , and the normalisation integral should be dropped altogether .",
    "this expression is very attractive as it allows one to consider a single ad expansion for arbitrary matrix elements of operators .",
    "it is the main objective of this paper to show that the linked ad theorem is correct only approximately .",
    "when the overlap between different group functions becomes larger , corrections are to be introduced .",
    "we show this by first considering in detail a simple `` toy '' model of a 1d ring for which the exact analytical solution is possible .",
    "this allows us to investigate in detail the limiting behaviour of the ad expansion for this system when the number of groups in the ring tends to infinity .",
    "then , we suggest a general method of calculating the mean values , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean - value ] ) , in a form of corrections to the linked ad theorem .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the subsequent section",
    "we shall briefly review the ad theory and introduce the linked ad theorem for the normalisation integral and rdm-1 .",
    "the consideration of higher order rdm s is analogous . in section 3",
    ", we consider in detail the toy model and obtain an exact expression for rdm-1 in the limit of an infinite ring size .",
    "this exact results will then be compared with that obtained using the linked ad theorem .",
    "a systematic way of constructing corrections to the linked ad theorem is then suggested in section 4 .",
    "first we consider a symmetric group @xmath28 .",
    "its elements permute electronic coordinates belonging only to the @xmath8-th group .",
    "joining together all such groups we obtain a subgroup @xmath29 of @xmath19 .",
    "any element of @xmath30 only interchanges electronic coordinates within the groups , i.e. performs only intra - group permutations .",
    "the algebraic foundation of the ad theory is based on the _",
    "double coset _ ( dc ) decomposition of the complete symmetric group @xmath19 with respect to @xmath30 , which enables to single out all inequivalent _ intergroup _ permutations @xmath31 @xcite :    @xmath32    here the sum runs over all distinct types , @xmath33 , of operations for intergroup permutations as well as all distinct ways , @xmath34 , of labelling actual groups ( eg s ) involved in it , and @xmath35 is a numerical factor .",
    "@xmath31 is a dc generator , which , involves only inter - group permutations and , in general , can be constructed as a product of some _ primitive _ cycles each involving no more than one electron from each group .",
    "each such a cycle is represented as a directed closed loop connecting all groups involved in it .",
    "thus , in general , each permutation @xmath31 can be drawn as an arrow diagram containing a collection of closed directed loops .",
    "these loops may pass through the given group several times ( depending on the number of electrons of the group which are involved in the permutation @xmath31 ) .",
    "if the groups involved in the diagram can not be separated without destroying the directed loops , the ad is called _ linked _ or _",
    "connected_. if , however , this separation is possible than the diagram is called _ non - linked _ or _ disconnected _ and it can be represented as a collection of linked parts .",
    "the decomposition coefficients @xmath36 can be calculated merely by counting arrows entering and leaving each group in the ad .    by writing the antisymmetriser @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : operator - a ] ) using the dc generators , it is possible to obtain the diagram expansion of the normalisation integral @xcite :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a product of all group functions .",
    "( [ eq : ad - expansion - for - s ] ) gives an expansion of @xmath26 in terms of diagrams identical to those for the permutation group @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion - of - sn ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath40 are represented as a product of rdm s of electronic groups involved in the permutation @xmath31 integrated over corresponding electronic coordinates . if each of the group functions @xmath41 is given as a sum of slater determinants with molecular orbitals expanded via some atomic orbitals ( ao ) basis set , then the matrix elements @xmath40 are eventually expressed as a sum of products of simple overlap integrals between the ao s of different electronic groups ( see,.e.g .",
    "it is important to note here that a total contribution of a non - linked ad is exactly equal to the product of contributions associated with each of its linked parts @xcite .    for the following , it is convenient to sort out all the terms in the diagrammatic expansion by the number of groups involved in the ad s .",
    "getting rid of the common factor @xmath42 , we can write :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the contribution of _ all _ ad s that correspond to intergroup permutations among @xmath45 different groups with the particular labelling @xmath46 .",
    "the unity in equation above corresponds to the trivial permutation .    for convenience , the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion - of - s - tilda ] ) will be referred to as the normalisation - integral expansion . in principle , in this expansion all groups of the entire system participate .",
    "it is also found convenient to introduce a derivative object , @xmath47 , which is obtained from the above expansion by retaining all the ad s which are associated only with the groups from a finite manifold @xmath48",
    "( i.e. containing groups with labels @xmath49 ) .",
    "if @xmath34 comprises the whole system , we arrive at @xmath50 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion - of - s - tilda ] ) .",
    "we shall also introduce a manifold @xmath51 $ ] , i.e. an artificial system which is obtained by `` removing '' from the entire system all groups comprising the set @xmath34 .",
    "then , @xmath52)$ ] ( we shall also use a simpler notation @xmath53 $ ] when convenient ) is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion - of - s - tilda ] ) by retaining only ad s in which any of the groups belonging to @xmath34 is _ not _ present ; in other words , @xmath52)$ ] is obtained from @xmath50 by assuming that in any of the ad s all the overlap integrals involving groups from the manifold @xmath34 are equal to zero .",
    "obviously , @xmath50 can be considered as a particular case of @xmath53 $ ] when the manifold @xmath34 is empty .",
    "we shall occasionally also use the notation @xmath54 $ ] for @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath48 , if we want to indicate explicitly which particular groups are excluded .",
    "the _ unnormalised _",
    "rdm-1 of the whole system ,    @xmath55    can also be written as a matrix element of a certain symmetrical one - particle operator @xcite . therefore , as in the case of the normalisation integral , by inserting the ad expansion for the operator @xmath22 , one obtains the corresponding ad expansion for the rdm-1 @xcite .",
    "it can be constructed by considering the ad expansion of @xmath26 and then modifying each diagram by placing a small open circle , representing the variables @xmath56 , in either of the three following ways : ( i ) on a group not involved in the diagram ; ( ii ) on a group involved in the diagram , and , finally , ( iii ) on an arrow .",
    "thus , each ad in the @xmath26 expansion serves as a reference in building up the ad expansion for the rdm-1 . since",
    "the contribution of any diagram , consisting of non - linked parts , is equal to the product of contributions corresponding to each of the parts , it can be shown @xcite that , in general , the ad expansion of the rdm-1 can be represented as@xmath57\\,\\sum_{t}\\rho_{k}^{t}(a_{1},\\ldots , a_{k}\\parallel x;x^{\\prime})\\label{eq : expansion - for - rdm-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the sum of contributions of all ad s with an open circle which are constructed using the particular group labelling @xmath59 .",
    "the sum over @xmath60 takes account of the two positions of the open circle on the reference ad : on an arrow and on a group .",
    "note that each ad with the open circle is necessarily a linked ( connected ) ad .",
    "one can see from the above equation that each ad with an open circle , constructed from groups @xmath48 , is multiplied by the sum of all possible normalisation - integral ad s ( i.e. ad s without the circle ) , @xmath54=\\widetilde{s}[t]$ ] , constructed using the rest of the system @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the rdm-1 introduced by eq .",
    "( [ eq : definition - of - rdm-1 ] ) is not normalised to the total number of electrons in the system since the wavefunction @xmath2 constructed using group functions , @xmath41 , is , in general , not normalised to unity : @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the true rdm-1 should be calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean - value ] ) as @xcite:@xmath62}\\,\\sum_{t}\\rho_{k}^{t}(a_{1},\\ldots , a_{k}\\parallel x;x^{\\prime})\\label{eq : true - rdm-1-expression}\\ ] ] where @xmath63}=f_{[a_{1},\\ldots , a_{k}]}=\\frac{\\widetilde{s}[a_{1},\\ldots , a_{k}]}{\\widetilde{s}}\\label{eq : prefactors}\\ ] ] are numerical pre - factors .",
    "these depend only on the chosen set of groups @xmath34 .",
    "since the normalisation integral @xmath50 is represented via an ad expansion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ad - expansion - for - s ] ) , one can see that the pre - factors are given as a ratio of two ad expansions , each containing a very large ( infinite ) number of terms for a large ( infinite ) system .",
    "thus , it follows from the last passage in eq .",
    "( [ eq : true - rdm-1-expression ] ) , that the true rdm-1 is represented as a sum of all linked ad s with the open circle , @xmath58 , multiplied by numerical pre - factors , @xmath64}$ ] .",
    "the calculation of the pre - factors poses the main problem in applying the ad theory to infinite or even large system ( for small systems all ad s can be accounted for explicitly and thus @xmath65 can easily be calculated , at least in principle ) .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that in the limit of an infinite system the pre - factors @xmath66}$ ] tend exactly to unity for any choice of the groups @xmath48 . as a result , it was argued that the true rdm-1 can be represented as a single ad expansion containing only ad s with the open circle which , as was mentioned earlier , are all linked ad s . the main argument put forward to prove this so - called linked - ad theorem was that any @xmath54 $ ] ( and , in particular , @xmath50 ) tends to infinity when the number of electronic groups @xmath11 tends to infinity .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to show that the situation is more subtle .",
    "although the argument about the limiting behaviour of @xmath53 $ ] put forward in @xcite may seem quite plausible , in some cases , as will be shown in the next section by considering an exactly solvable toy model , @xmath53 $ ] may have a zero limit .",
    "the main reason for this is that contributions of different ad s in the expansion have alternating signs , the point overlooked previously . as a result",
    ", the pre - factors @xmath66}$ ] do not necessarily tend to unity , but may take a different value depending on the given system .",
    "let us consider a ring of @xmath11 equally spaced one - electron groups as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : our-toy-model ] ( _ a _ ) .",
    "each group is described by a single real @xmath67-type normalised wavefunction @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) localised around the group centre .",
    "all groups are identical , i.e. every localised function @xmath68 can be obtained by a corresponding translation of the neighbouring function .",
    "note that @xmath70 for this model and the ring wavefunction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : total - psi ] ) represents essentially a single slater determinant @xmath71 .",
    "hence , this theory should be equivalent to the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "we assume that only neighbouring functions overlap .",
    "due to the symmetry of the model , only one parameter , namely the overlap integral @xmath72 between any neighbouring groups , is required to characterise the system ; the actual spatial form of @xmath68 is not actually needed .",
    "we shall show that the rdm-1 of this system can be calculated analytically for any @xmath11 .",
    "most remarkably , it will be shown that the @xmath73 limit is also analytically attainable . using this result , we will analyse the linked - ad theorem",
    ". we shall find that some corrections are required .",
    "two independent methods will be used to consider the toy model .",
    "it is first instructive to perform the calculation using a method which is completely independent of the ad theory .",
    "this is indeed possible since an expression for the rdm-1 of any hf system can be written explicitly via orbitals and their overlap matrix @xcite . taking into account that only overlap between nearest neighbours exists , we obtain for the ring electron density ( the diagonal elements of the rdm-1):@xmath74    @xmath75\\label{eq : ro - via - inverse - s}\\ ] ]    here @xmath76 is the inverse of the overlap matrix    @xmath77_{n\\times n}\\label{eq : overlap - matrix}\\ ] ]    between the ring orbitals .",
    "note that all the omitted elements in the above expression are zeros .",
    "this convention is adopted hereafter .",

    "( [ eq : overlap - matrix ] ) . to avoid a possible confusion with the overlap matrix , we use for the normalisation integral a different notation here , @xmath80 .    for the convenience of the following calculation , we also introduce a similar _ chain _ system shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : g - chain ] ) . combined with the obvious initial expressions @xmath85 and @xmath86 ,",
    "the above relations allow one to calculate the @xmath87 and @xmath80 for any value of @xmath88 .",

    "also , in agreement with @xcite , one can see that numerical pre - factors in each term grow with increase of @xmath88 .",
    "it is now straightforward to investigate the limiting behaviour of these quantities when the number of groups tends to infinity ( the @xmath93 limit ) .",
    "we find , using a simple numerical calculation , that both of them tend to _ zero _ with increase of @xmath88 for _ any _ value of @xmath94 ( it will be clear later on that the limit does not exist for @xmath95 ) . since both @xmath87 and @xmath80 correspond to the normalisation integrals for the two systems",
    ", one can see that this limiting behaviour is quite different from what should have been expected from the analysis performed in ref .",
    "this is explained by the fact that both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given by infinite series with alternating terms .",
    "the limiting behaviour of each of the series is not straightforward in spite of the fact that the pre - factors to _ each _ term @xmath98(@xmath99 ) tend to infinity when @xmath93 .    in order to calculate the rdm-1 ( [ eq : ro - via - inverse - s ] )",
    ", one also need the corresponding elements of the inverse of the overlap matrix .",
    "using the explicit structure of the matrix @xmath79 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap - matrix ] ) , one obtains :    @xmath100    @xmath101    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are cofactors of @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s(-1)-ii ] ) and ( [ eq : s(-1)-ij ] ) , we obtain for the electron density ( [ eq : ro - via - inverse - s ] ) :    @xmath106    @xmath107    the above expression allows one to calculate the electron density of the ring with arbitrary number of groups . the @xmath93 limit will be considered separately in section [ sub : infinite - ring ] .",
    "we shall show in this section that the same expressions as derived in the previous subsection can also be obtained using a much simpler algebra of the ad theory .    to this end",
    ", we first consider the normalisation integral @xmath108 of the ring .",
    "since all groups contain a single electron and only nearest groups have non - zero overlap , the ad expansion contains essentially only bubble - like ad s between two adjacent groups ( including all non - linked ad s constructed out of them ) and two ad s connecting _ all _ groups ( a @xmath88-vertex polygon ) with opposite direction of arrows , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cap : s - expansion - for - ring ] .",
    "an ad expansion for the @xmath87 looks similarly .",
