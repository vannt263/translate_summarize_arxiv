    "ic10 x-1 is a dynamically confirmed black hole ( bh ) + wolf - rayet ( wr ) binary , which exhibits @xmath035 hour periodic modulation in the x - ray and optical lightcurves @xcite ; the likely association between the bh and wr was first reported by @xcite .",
    "its mass function is 7.6@xmath101.3 @xmath6 , giving a bh mass @xmath02338 @xmath6 for the likely range in wr mass and system inclination @xcite .",
    "ic10 x-1 was previously observed by xmm - newton in 2003 .",
    "@xcite reported large intensity variation over @xmath010 ks : a factor of up to @xmath06 in the 0.52.0 kev band , and a factor 4 in the 2.07.5 kev band ; they suggested that this could be due to an eclipse by the companion star .",
    "they found that the emission spectrum was well characterised by a multi - temperature disk blackbody , and rejected a simple power law model ; the observed 1.18@xmath100.02 kev inner disk temperature was consistent with a black hole binary in its thermal dominant state @xcite .",
    "however , this fit required a metalicity @xmath110.01 solar because solar abundance models failed to provide acceptable fits .",
    "they inferred a bh mass of @xmath04 @xmath9 for a non - spinning bh , and a mass @xmath06 times greater for a rapidly spinning bh .",
    "@xcite attempted to compare the spectra in and out of the eclipse , but there were too few counts to observe any significant differences .",
    "ic10 x-1 was also observed several times with chandra and swift , leading to the discovery of its orbital period @xcite .",
    "the 0.310 kev lightcurve of ic10 x-1 exhibits deep , periodic intensity dips that have been interpreted as eclipses by the wr ; however , the full dip profile had never previously been seen .",
    "ic10 x-1 was observed with xmm - newton for @xmath0130 ks , equivalent to @xmath01 orbital cycle , in 2012 june ( obsid 0693390101003 , pi t. strohmayer ) .",
    "@xcite found the intensity dip to be asymmetric , with ingress and egress times of @xmath03.3 and 4.6 hours , with a maximum eclipse lasting @xmath05.2 hours .",
    "additionally , they found @xmath07 mhz quasiperiodic oscillations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "such evolution , with the egress substantially longer than the ingress , is highly reminiscent of the behavior observed in the high inclination galactic neutron star binaries known as the dipping sources ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that ic10 x-1 experiences similar processes , and we therefore present a brief review of the galactic dipping sources . when discussing these systems , the term `` eclipse ''",
    "is reserved for energy - independent occultation by the companion star ; the energy - dependent photo - electric absorption by other material is referred to as `` dipping '' , and individual events are called `` dips '' .",
    "however we note that hmxbs such as vela x-1 can also exhibit such asymmetric lightcurves due to asymmetries in the wind .",
    "it is of fundamental importance to determine whether this intensity modulation is energy - dependent or not ; energy - dependent dipping can not be due to occultation of the x - ray source by the star itself .",
    "around 10 galactic low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) exhibit periodic intensity dips in their x - ray lightcurves on the orbital period .",
    "this behavior is caused by photoelectric absorption of x - rays by cold material in the outer accretion disk , such as the bulge where the accretiion stream collides with the disk @xcite .",
    "the spectral evolution during dipping is well understood as the progressive covering of a point - like thermal component ( from the ns ) and an extended comptonized component by an extended absorber ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal component sees little additional absorption until the covering fraction of the comptonized component reaches @xmath050% ; then the absorption of the thermal component jumps to very large values ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that some dipping sources exhibit shallow `` shoulders '' on either side of the dip ; these are energy - independent and consistent with electron scattering by the ionized outer region of the absorber ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "4u1624@xmath1249 is a galactic dipping source with orbital period @xmath021 hours that does not exhibit eclipses .",
    "its @xmath0110 kev lightcurve from the 1985 march 25 exosat observation exhibited flat - bottomed dipping @xcite that strongly resembles the `` eclipses '' observed in the 0.310 kev xmm - newton lightcurve of ic10 x-1",
    ". however , rxte observations of 4u 1624@xmath1249 exhibit no signs of dipping above 15 kev @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the periodic intensity dips observed in ic10 x-1 could be caused by material in the outer accretion disk instead of the donor star . in some cases , the duration of dipping can be extremely high : the transient , eclipsing , galactic ns xb exo 0748@xmath12676 suffered dipping for @xmath1370% of the orbital cycle during a 1993 may asca observation @xcite .",
    "one common property of the absorption features in dipping sources is that the egress is shallower than the ingress ( and strohmayer et al .",
    "2013 noted this property in the ic10 x-1 lightcurve ) .",
    "since the thermal and non - thermal components of the dipping sources suffer increased absorption at different rates during dipping , it is clear that the ingress is caused by a change in covering fraction , rather than a change in the density of the absorber .",
    "it is therefore possible to estimate the scale of the comptonized region ( i.e. the corona ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the corona sizes for 5 dipping sources with 130 kev luminosities @xmath14@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 using the following approximation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the orbital period , @xmath19 is the ingress time , @xmath20 is the radius of the accretion disk , and @xmath3 is the radius of the disk corona . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath20 to be 80% of the roche lobe equivalent radius , @xmath21 , based on values 0.740.84@xmath21 from the simulations of @xcite and 0.9@xmath21 from @xcite .",
    "the radius of a sphere with volume equivalent to the roche lobe of the accretor , @xmath21 , was calculated from the following expression derived by @xcite ( accurate to 1% ) : @xmath22},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the binary separation , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of the accretor and donor respectively .",
    "@xcite found corona radii @xmath020,000700,000 km ( @xmath01060% of the disk , with 15% typical ) ; they also found that @xmath3 @xmath26 @xmath27 with 99% confidence .",
    "they presented evidence that @xmath3 is comparable to the compton radius , i.e. the maximum radius for hydrostatic equilibrium ; this radius is expected to increase with luminosity because the electron temperature is reduced by the higher flux of soft photons .",
    "more recently , the extended corona model was used to explain the odd dipping behavior exhibited by cygnus x-2 , where the blackbody component is unaffected @xcite .",
    "cygnus x-2 was simultaneously observed in radio , optical and x - ray with xmm - newton , chandra , and the european vlbi network , and a combination of ccd and grating spectroscopy was used to probe the dip evolution .",
    "the blackbody emission was unaffected by these dips , while @xmath040% of the comptonized component from the extended corona suffered extra absorption equivalent to 3@xmath28 h atom @xmath29 .",
    "the dips occured at phase 0.35 in the orbital cycle , opposite the bulge where the accretion stream impacts the disk ; @xcite demonstrated that such material viewed at inclinations @xmath160@xmath30 could cover large parts of the corona without reaching the ns .",
    "@xcite found independent evidence for extended coronae in ns lmxbs from chandra grating spectroscopy of cygnus x-2 .",
    "they examined several emission lines between 1.525 with the high energy transmission grating .",
    "these emission lines were observed at rest , and had widths between 1120 and 2730 km s@xmath16 ; these corresponded to a corona radius @xmath020,000110,000 km .    one model describing such a system is that of @xcite , where the hot corona is coplanar with the cold accretion disk ; photons from the cold disk feed the corona , while high energy photons from the corona heat the disk . indeed xmm - newton observations of several bright extra - galactic x - ray binaries have revealed spectra that strongly prefer models where the comptonized component dominates the low - energy spectrum to models where the thermal component dominates @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite suggested an alternative explanation for dipping after discovering absorption lines in xmm - newton observations of 4u1323@xmath1262 that grow stronger during dipping .",
    "they proposed that variations in the continuum and absorption lines could be produced by using a warm , highly - ionized absorber ; their model does not require partial covering , or an extend corona .",
    "@xcite were able to get acceptable fits to individual spectra of 4u1323@xmath1262 at different stages of dipping .",
    "however , @xcite examined xmm - newton observations of several other galactic dipping lmxbs , fitting different stages of dipping simultaneously ; they quote best fits with @xmath31/dof = 1.151.3 , but the many degrees of freedom ( 7201340 ) meant that the fits were formally unacceptable , and it is unclear whether this is due to the model or uncertainties in calibration etc .. furthermore , the warm absorber model can not account for the dipping in cygnus x-2 where the blackbody is unaffected @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a highly - ionized absorbing region in dipping xbs is very interesting ; however , the warm absorber model is not a credible replacement for partial covering . while we are unlikely to see such features in ic10 x-1 from the disk , it is possible that the warm wr wind may act in a similar way .",
    "one substantial difference between ic10 x-1 and the dipping lmxbs is that the donor is a wolf - rayet rather than a roche lobe - filling low mass star .",
    "@xcite showed that the wr could not be roche lobe filling , and expected only a tenuous accretion disk from the stellar wind .",
    "such a tenuous disk may not support the extended corona or the substantial absorber observed in the galactic ns dipping sources .",
    "however @xcite proposed that ic10 x-1 contains a substantial accretion disk that is fed by the wr wind rather than roche lobe overflow .",
    "the bh hmxbs cygnus x-1 , lmc x-1 , and lmc x-3 have longer orbital periods than ic10 x-1 , yet their x - ray spectra still exhibit substantial disk emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) ; lmc x-3 is powered by roche lobe overflow , but cygnus x-1 and lmc x-1 are likely powered by a wind - fed disk , and ic10 x-1 is too .",
    "we note that the x - ray emission from galactic ns hmxb vela x-1 is dominated by 2 - 3 power laws with the same photon index but with different normalizations and column densities ; this is interpreted as direct emission from the neutron star as well as a scattered component from free electrons in the wind ; vela x-1 exhibits eclipses on a @xmath09 day period , and some direct emission is still seen during eclipse ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) . since ic10 x-1 has a very strong wind , it is possible that some of its emission is scattered also .",
    "vela x-1 also exhibits strong fluorescence line emission , as well as recombination lines and continuum emisssion from highly ionzed gas @xcite , which we are unlikely to detect in ic10 x-1 .",
    "we consider three scenarios in this work that could produce the observed lightcurve : energy - independent occultation by the donor star , energy - dependent absorption from structure in a substantial disk , and energy - dependent absorption from the stellar wind .",
    "the latter two scenarios are indistinguishable from the x - ray data , so our spectral analysis only considers energy - independent vs. energy - dependent evolution .",
    "ic10 x-1 was observed by xmm - newton on 2012 august 18 for @xmath0130 ks ( obs i d 0693390101003 , pi t. strohmayer ) .",
    "we analyzed these data with the xmm - newton software analysis system ( sas ) version 13.0.0 .",
    "substantial background flares occurred near the beginning and end of the observation @xcite ; we identified these events by extracting a 1012 kev lightcurve with pattern==0 and flag==0 , and highlighting intervals with pn intensities @xmath10.4 count s@xmath16 .",
    "we extracted source and background spectra from the pn instrument , and analyzed these spectra with xspec version 12.8.1 .",
    "these spectra were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "the background was accumulated from a circular region of empty sky on the same ccd as the source region .",
    "since the intensity dips are thought to be caused by absorption , we simultaneously fitted non - dip and dip spectra ; the emission parameters were the same for the non - dip and dip spectra , but free to vary .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to fit the ingress or egress because the timescale of spectral evolution is significantly shorter than the exposure time required for good spectra .",
    "we used the abund command in xspec to specify a metalicity 0.15 times solar ( appropriate for ic10 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming the solar abundances reported by @xcite .",
    "however , xspec does not allow us to specify a solar - metalicity foreground absorber when the abundance is set this way ; the galactic foreground absorption is translated into some portion of the measured low - metalicity absorption .",
    "in figure  [ lc ] we present the background - subtracted 0.310 kev pn intensity lightcurve of ic10 x-1 ( black ) , and the background lightcurve in gray for comparison .",
    "horizontal lines represent the intervals used when extracting spectra : the solid line represents the non - dip interval ( 90,000 - 110,000 s after t@xmath32 ) , and the dashed line represents the dip interval ( 20,00040,000 s after t@xmath32 ) .",
    "the non - dip spectrum yielded 9250 net source counts , while the dip spectrum yielded 1150 net source counts .",
    "simultaneous fitting of the non - dip and dip spectra allowed us to test different models for the spectral evolution , which we discuss in turn .",
    "these dips could be energy - independent if caused by the donor star itself ; alternatively they could be energy - dependent absorption features due to structure in the outer accretion disk ( as seen in the galactic dipping sources , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or due to the dense stellar wind from the wolf - rayet donor .",
    "to test whether the absorption is energy - dependent , we examined the low and high energy lightcurves . to accomplish this , we created source and background lightcurves in the 0.31.0 and 4.010 kev bands .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ cols ] shows the background - subtracted 0.31.0 kev and 4.010 kev lightcurves from the pn , binned to 1000 s. the right panel shows the hardness ratio defined by 4.010 kev intensity divided by 0.31.0 kev . the best fit value for a constant hardness ratio yielded @xmath31/dof = 62/12",
    "this has a good fit probability @xmath33 , and is rejected at a 5.6 @xmath2 level .",
    "therefore , the absorption can not be simple occultation by the wr , and must come from a lower - density region such as the bulge in the outer accretion disk , or from the wr wind .",
    "we tested a series of spectral models by simultaneously fitting non - dip and dip data ( as defined above ) , with only the absorption free to vary .",
    "all of our spectral models include line - of - sight absorption , @xmath34 , and a partial covering component ( pcf in xspec ) that is described by the amount of absorption , @xmath35 , and the fraction of the emission region covered , @xmath36 .",
    "for the non - dip spectrum , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are frozen at 0 .",
    "the models also include a disk blackbody component ( diskbb in xspec ) , parameterized by inner disk temperature @xmath37 , and some sort of comptonization component ( simpl , comptt , or po short for power law in xspec ) .",
    "we use the cflux convolution model to estimate the 0.310 kev intrinsic luminosity of each emission component ; we adopt a 715 kpc distance to ic10 @xcite , which is subject to @xmath1010 kpc random uncertainties and @xmath1060 kpc systematic uncertainties .      we first consider a compact corona scenario ( model i ) , where the emission consists of a disk blackbody and a comptonized component , represented by tbabs*(cflux*diskbb+cflux*comptt ) in xspec .",
    "many authors believe that the corona resides inside the accretion disk , and can only access the hottest photons at the inner edge of the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hence , we set the seed photon temperature of the comptt component to the inner disk temperature of the disk blackbody component .",
    "the best fit model yielded @xmath37 = 0.133@xmath100.010 kev , with the comptt parameters unconstrained ; @xmath38 = 6.2@xmath100.6@xmath39 atom @xmath29 , @xmath35 = 8.2@xmath40 atom @xmath29 , @xmath36 = 0.886@xmath100.004 , and @xmath31/dof = 420/427 .",
    "statistically , this model is a good fit to the spectrum ; however , the inner disk temperature is very low , indicating a near maximum retrograde spin for a black hole with mass @xmath030 @xmath6 , which is possible but unlikely .",
    "the total 0.310 kev luminosity for this fit is 1.8@xmath100.7@xmath41 erg s@xmath16 , 47@xmath1018% eddington for a @xmath030 @xmath6 bh .",
    "we next applied the simpl @xcite convolution model for comptonization ( model ii ) , where a fraction of the thermal emission , @xmath42 is comptonized , and described by a power law with photon index @xmath43 .",
    "the appropriate spectral model was tbabs*pcf*cflux*simpl*diskbb .",
    "the best fit yielded @xmath37 = 0.118@xmath100.010 kev , @xmath43 = 2.43@xmath100.06 , @xmath42 = 0.020@xmath100.013 ; @xmath38 = 6.9@xmath100.6@xmath39 atom @xmath29 , @xmath35 = 9.3@xmath102.4@xmath44 atom @xmath29 , @xmath36 = 0.886@xmath100.004 , and @xmath31/dof = 438/428 .",
    "the results from this model are very similar to those obtained with the previous model , although the comptonized component is better constrained .",
    "again , the low temperature makes this scenario unlikely .",
    "the 0.310 kev luminosity is 3.7@xmath101.7@xmath41 erg s@xmath16 , i.e. 100@xmath1040% eddington for a @xmath030 @xmath9 bh .",
    "we note that since simpl is a convolution model , we can not treat the thermal and non - thermal components separately .",
    "we are therefore unable to apply different absorptions to the thermal and comptonized components .",
    "this may explain why the best fit parameters resemble those for model i , even though simpl does not specify a compact corona .",
    "finally we considered a compact corona model that includes scattering from free electrons in the wind ( model iii ) .",
    "the xspec model used was pcf*tbabs*(cflux*diskbb+cflux*comptt)+ + pcf*tbabs*(cflux*diskbb+cflux*comptt ) , with the seed temperature of the comptt component linked with the inner disk temperature as with model i. the spectral shapes of the two components ( i.e. inner disk temperature , electron temperature , and opacity ) were the same for each component but free to vary ; the normalizations of each component were unconstrained .",
    "this model fitted the spectra very well , which is perhaps unsurprising given that it contained 4 emission components and 11 free parameters : @xmath31/dof = 383/422 .",
    "however , the inner disk temperature ( 0.20@xmath100.03 kev ) indicated a strong retrograde spin , as with previous models with a compact corona . in table  1",
    "we present two values each for the absorption , normalization and partial covering parameters , corresponding to the direct and scattered emission respectively .",
    "we note that for the scattered component , the thermal flux goes to zero , while the comptonized flux is higher than for the direct component ; this is probably an artifact caused by fitting the high energy excess in the dip spectrum .      since the extended corona may have access to soft photons from the outer disk in addition to the harder photons at the inner disk ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , the comptonized component is decoupled from the thermal component , and may be represented as a power law .",
    "we explore two models for the extended corona scenario : one where both components suffered the same absorption , and one with different absorption for the thermal and comptonized component .",
    "we modeled these scenarios as tbabs*(tbabs@xmath45*cflux*diskbb+ + pcf*cflux*po ) . the additional absorption suffered by the thermal component , i.e. tbabs@xmath45 ,",
    "was frozen at 0 for the non - dip spectrum .    forcing the disk blackbody and",

    "we note that the scale of the corona is strongly related to the scale of the absorber , which is proportional to its distance from the x - ray emission regions .",
    "we assume that the absorbing material is located at the edge of the disk ; if it were instead located further in , for example near the circularization radius , then the corona sizes of ic10 x-1 and the galactic dipping sources would all be smaller by similar amounts .",
    "if the absorption is caused by the wr wind , then the corona could be substantially larger .",
    "galactic ns xbs can exhibit dipping due to material in the outer disk for inclinations @xmath1360@xmath30 @xcite .",

    "@xcite estimated the deepest dip to last 5.2 hr , with a 3.3 hr ingress and a 4.6 hr egress , although the ingress was observed at the start of the observation , when the background radiation was high .",

    "@xcite estimated the black hole mass for a range of wr masses ( 17 , 25 , and 35 @xmath6 ) and inclinations ( 65 , 78 , and 90@xmath30 ) , and we calculated the roche lobe radius for the wr ( @xmath62 ) for each scenario .",
    "we found that @xmath62 @xmath00.340.38@xmath23 , hence the roche lobe is somewhat smaller than the maximum dip ( 0.96@xmath23 ) .",
    "the long egress would require a thick stellar wind out to @xmath13@xmath62 .",
    "@xcite found that the wr optical properties were well described by @xmath085000 k emission with a luminosity 10@xmath63 @xmath64 , although other solutions were also possible .",
    "if we assume that the wr is emitting as a blackbody , then the optically thick part of the star has a radius @xmath00.60.75 @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the absence of eclipsing rules out inclinations @xmath137580@xmath30 ; a more massive wr allows a higher inclination , because @xmath23 increases with the mass of the system .",
    "we note that it is possible for the x - ray photosphere of the wr in ic10 x-1 to be substantially larger than the optical photosphere ( our spectra see absorption equivalent to @xmath132@xmath65 h atom @xmath29 as energy - independent ) ; a larger photosphere would impose tighter constraints on the maximum inclination .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of ic10 x-1 contrasts with that of m33 x-7 , another high inclination bh xb @xcite . in this case , the donor ( 3649 @xmath6 ) is @xmath046 times more massive than the bh for various inclinations .",
    "@xcite folded the 0.55.0 kev lightcurves from several chandra observations , revealing a flat - bottomed dip where the minimum lasted @xmath00.16 orbital cycles . using equation 2 we calculated the roche lobe radius for the m33 x-7 donor to be @xmath00.5@xmath23 ;",
    "this is entirely consistent with a true eclipse if the donor fills , or nearly fills , its roche lobe .",

    "however , the observed optical he line used by @xcite and @xcite to calculate the mass function shows that some of the gas is neutral ; perhaps this neutral material is in the x - ray shadow of the wr .",
    "the ionization state of the absorbing material will greatly impact its absorbing signature .",
    "the x - ray ionization also impacts the wind velocity , because the winds are line - driven ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this complicates matters further , since the wind density ( therefore ionization state ) is affected by its velocity @xcite .",
    "the fact that the wr is in a close binary system with a roche lobe radius not much larger than wr radius complicates things yet further ; for instance , it is not even clear whether the galactic wr x - ray binary cygnus x-3 contains a black hole or a neutron star , because much of the line emission is dominated or contaminated by the wind ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one thing we can do is examine the absorption in the non - dip and dip spectra , and compare the difference with variations observed in other windy systems . for our favored model ( model v , assuming metalicity 0.15 solar ) , @xmath38 = 3.91@xmath100.16@xmath39 atom @xmath29 for the non - dip spectrum , a factor @xmath08 higher than the galactic hi column density in the direction of ic10 in both the @xcite survey and the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite .",

    "such an ionized absorber is expected to produce absorption features similar to those seen in galactic high inclination xbs @xcite",

    "@xcite noted that scenarios such as a wind - fed circumbinary envelope , or outflows from a disk are expected to be symmetrical around the accretor , and would not result in the observed flux variation ; instead they suggest that the absorption may come from an inflated bulge where the stellar wind collides with the accretion disk .",
    "they were unable to perform formal fits , due to the complexity of the model , but were able to reproduce observed spectra . with additional information from the power spectra , @xcite were able to estimate the size of the cloud to be @xmath77 cm , with a temperature @xmath78 @xmath03 kev and an optical depth @xmath07 .",
    "the behavior exhibited by ic10 x-1 is strikingly different to the proposed behavior of cygnus x-3 , in that the high energy photons contribute a larger portion of the total flux in the dip spectrum than in the non - dip spectrum . at high energies ,",
    "the spectra are visibly converging in fig .",
    "[ fold ] ; also the models with energy - independent absorption systematically underestimated the high energy flux .",
    "an obvious difference between the two systems is in the orbital periods : 4.8 hr vs. @xmath034 hr ; accordingly , the accretor in cygnus x-3 is likely to be embedded in a considerably more dense wind than the bh in ic10 x-1 .",
    "we note that if we assume cosmic abundances for model v , the non - dip absorption is just 7@xmath79 atom @xmath29 , only 2@xmath79 @xmath29 above the line - of - sight absorption @xcite , and a factor @xmath015 lower than for cygnus x-3 .",

    "@xcite analyzed twice - weekly swift observations of the well - known ulx ngc5408 x-1 over a 485 day interval , and found evidence for orbital modulation on a 115@xmath104 day period .",
    "their spectral modeling suggested 0.310 kev luminosities up to @xmath02@xmath80 erg s@xmath16 .",
    "the modulation was energy - dependent with an amplitude 0.24@xmath100.02 below 1 kev and 0.13@xmath100.02 above 1 kev ; they suggest that the system has a 115 day orbital period , with a giant or supergiant donor . @xcite",
    "considered the possibility that a super - orbital period was observed , but found it unlikey because it was shorter than any such period observed in bh xbs to date .",

    "however , this 115 day period was considerably weakened when the swift observations were extended to @xmath01200 days ; instead , sharp intensity dips were observed on a @xmath0245 day period @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the phase distribution of the 27 observed dips assuming a 243 day period , which was consistent with a gaussian with fwhm 0.24 in phase .",
    "the galactic bh hmxb cygnus x-1 exhibits short , energy - dependent dips that are concentrated at phase @xmath00.7 that is thought to be due to the stream of material passing through the l1 point @xcite , and @xcite suggest that ngc5408 x-1 could be exhibiting similar behavior , and infer a high inclination ( @xmath070@xmath30 ) , similar to that of ic10 x-1 .",
    "however , we note that @xcite found no evidence for energy dependent dips in the swift lightcurve of ngc5408 x-1 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite analyzed non - dip and dip spectra , and the differences are consistent with a change in normalization rather than in column density .",
    "@xcite favor an orbital period @xmath0245 days , but note that it could be super - orbital .",
    "however , @xcite consider the @xmath0245 day period to be super - orbital , as they find that the strongest peak in their power spectrum is at @xmath02.6 days , with other peaks at 115 and 183 days .",
    "we note that the m31 globular cluster xb bo 158 ( xb158 ) exhibits deep dipping on a @xmath010 ks period in some observations but not others , demonstrating that the disk is precessing @xcite ; we found that the luminosity of bo 158 varied over @xmath0440@xmath83 erg s@xmath16 during our @xmath0monthly chandra monitoring program , and suggested that this luminosity variation was due to changes in accretion rate over the disk precession cycle @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the dips observed in ngc5408 x-1 are due to variations in accretion rate on the superorbital cycle also .",
    "a shorter orbital period would suggest a lower bh mass than the 1000 @xmath6 assumed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if ngc5408 x-1 exhibited a coplanar , extended corona as suggested by our modeling of ic10 x-1 , then the observed luminosity of @xmath84 erg s@xmath16 could be produced by the corona while keeping the emission locally sub - eddington .",
    "however , we note that there is some evidence for a 1000 @xmath6 bh from the energy spectrum and quasi - periodic oscillations exhibited by ngc5408 x-1 ( see * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "another aspect to consider is whether the wind is spherical or aspherical .",
    "knowledge of the wind geometry will constrain the inclination of the system , and therefore the bh mass . when calculating the bh mass , we adopt the mass function obtained by @xcite , and estimate the bh mass for the range of wr masses used in that work .",
    "the duration of the observed x - ray dipping suggests that the absorber have a radius @xmath03 @xmath62 , yet our spectral modeling suggests that @xmath01015% of the emission is completely unabsorbed in the deepest dipping . if the absorber were spherical , this would require either a low inclination ( @xmath040@xmath8 ) or electron scattering in the wind . since the non - dip and dip spectra converge at high energies ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the residual emission is unlikely to be dominated by scattering .",
    "such a low inclination would suggest a bh mass @xmath05065 @xmath6 for a wr with mass 1735 @xmath6 .",
    "a 65 @xmath6 bh is not impossible , if it was formed via direct collapse of a metal poor , high mass star so that little mass was lost during the main sequence lifetime @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite cite ic10 x-1 as an example of a star born in a galaxy with moderate metalicity ( they assume 0.3 solar ) , with a bh mass that is in good agreement with what they expect for such metalicities .",
    "@xcite found the maximum bh mass to be @xmath015 @xmath6 for solar metalicity , @xmath030 @xmath6 for 30% solar , and @xmath080 @xmath6 for 1% solar .",
    "we are unable to simply interpolate the maximum mass for 15% solar metalicity , but it seems unlikely to be as high as 5065 @xmath6 .",
    "one possible cause for an aspherical wr wind is stellar rotation .",
    "@xcite examined a population of single wr stars , and found evidence that 20% of the sample have flattened winds , using linear spectropolarimetry .",
    "also , @xcite suggested that the wind of the donor in cygnus x-3 is highly perturbed , and may be consistent with the presence of a disk wind ; this may be in the orbital plane .",
    "another possible cause for asymmetrical absorption in the wind would be the gas stream ( as seen at phase 0.6 in cygnus x-1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so long as the inclination is high enough .",
    "@xcite performed two dimensional simulations of such streams , finding that density of the stream is enhanced by a factor 2030 ; this is similar to the observed density variation in ic10 x-1 .",
    "furthermore , the tidal stream would produce stable absorption features that are fixed in phase , and that last for a substantial portion of the orbital cycle , again similar to ic10 x-1 .",
    "while this scenario is appealing , there are two caveats .",
    "firstly , @xcite assumed an inclination of 90@xmath30 for their simulations ; the stream would likely have a reduced effect at lower inclinations .",
    "secondly , the strength of the gas stream was found to be strongly dependent on the separation , @xmath23 , between the stars ; the simulations covered separations of 1.51.7 stellar radii , while in ic10 x-1 , the separation is 45 wr radii .    in order to avoid energy - independent eclipsing by the wr , and yet still see a aubstantial stream , the inclination would likely be @xmath07578@xmath30 . using the @xcite mass function and wr mass estimates",
    "yields a bh mass @xmath02433 @xmath6 for this scenario .",
    "we have analyzed the spectral and temporal evolution of the bh+wr xb ic10 x-1 , during a 130 ks xmm - newton observation .",
    "ic10 x-1 exhibits x - ray intensity dips on a @xmath035 hr orbital period , and we considered three scenarios : energy - independent eclipses , and energy - dependent absorption from either material in the accretion disk or the wr wind .    analyzing the 0.31.0 kev and 4.010 kev lightcurves showed the probability for a constant hardness ratio ( @xmath85 ) was @xmath02@xmath86 , rejected at a 5.6@xmath2 level .",
    "therefore , the intensity dips can not be due to simple occultation by the wr , and must come from a lower - density region such as the outer accretion disk or the wr wind .",
    "our favoured results were obtained from a model consisting of a disk blackbody component that was completely removed during the dip , and a partially - covered comptonized component ; a similar model has been successfully applied to high - inclination ns xbs in our galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    one model for such",
    "a system is the two - phase accretion disk proposed by @xcite ; in this scenario , a coplanar , hot corona embeds the cold disk , and is fed by cool photons from the disk while hot photons from the corona heat the disk .",
    "if we assume that the dip is caused by material in the outer disk , then we may estimate the size of the corona from the dip ingress ; the thermal and comptonized emission regions in galactic dipping sources increase in absorption at different rates during dip evolution , meaning that the ingress is a change in absorbed fraction rather than a change in density ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "we estimate the corona size to be @xmath010@xmath4 km .",
    "remarkably , this result is consistent with the relation found between corona size and 130 kev luminosity in galactic dipping ns xbs @xcite ; the 130 kev luminosity was 1.40@xmath100.06@xmath46 erg s@xmath16 . for this scenario",
    "the inclination is likely to be @xmath06080@xmath30 , giving a bh mass @xmath02441 @xmath6 , which is slightly larger than the current estimate .",

    "the bh mass would therefore be @xmath02433 @xmath6 , within the current range .",
    "we note that an absorbing wind would need to be considerably larger than an absorber in the disk to produce the same ingress and egress times , hence the corona would be similarly larger .",
    "while it is unclear whether the absorbing material originates in the accretion disk or wr wind , our results provide hard evidence that ic10 x-1 has a substantial extended corona .",
