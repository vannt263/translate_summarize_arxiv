    "despite observations over a broad range of wavelengths and via numerous techniques , the star  remains an enigma .",
    "it is the third brightest zz  ceti known ( @xmath3 ) , and has pulsation amplitudes among the largest measured for these variables ( up to 6% modulations at optical wavelengths ) .",
    "it is the most extensively observed large amplitude zz  ceti star , having been the subject of two global observing campaigns ( winget et al .  ;",
    "kleinman et al .  ) and of countless single - site time series measurements ( kleinman et al .  ) .",
    "it has also been the target of several infrared and radial velocity studies following the detection of an infrared excess by zuckerman & becklin ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , we still have neither an unambiguous asteroseismological solution for the star , nor an explanation for the source of the mysterious dust apparently responsible for its excess emission in the infrared .",
    "recently , kleinman ( @xcite , also kleinman et al . ) analyzed all of the optical time - series photometry of this object , and showed that in spite of the changing character of the pulsation spectrum each season , there is a stable set of recurring modes .",
    "this is an important breakthrough for , and perhaps for all the large amplitude zz  ceti stars , because measuring mode periods is a prerequisite for measuring mass and internal structure using stellar seismology .",
    "the only remaining obstacle is to identify the spherical harmonic degree   and radial order  of the modes detected , so that their periods can be compared to those of like eigenmodes in structural models of white dwarf stars .",
    "the pattern identified by kleinman ( @xcite ) is sufficiently rich that he was able to attempt mode identification using the same techniques applied successfully to dov ( winget et al . ) and dbv pulsators ( winget et al .  ) .",
    "he searched for the ( roughly ) equal period spacings and frequency splittings that signify rotationally split non - radial _ g_-modes .",
    "his attempt was a measured success ; he found that the pattern of modes was sensible if interpreted as a sequence of mostly @xmath4 modes .",
    "unfortunately , his analysis could not assure that any individual mode was @xmath4 , nor did it allow an unambiguous comparison to structural models ( bradley & kleinman @xcite ) .    with this in mind , and having available to us the bright portion of a night allocated to very faint sources at the keck ii telescope , we decided to test a method for identifying the degree of pulsation modes using  as our subject .",
    "the method was inspired by the work of robinson et al .",
    "( ) , who used hubble space telescope high speed photometry in the ultraviolet to measure   for modes in the star 117-b15a .",
    "their technique exploited the sensitivity of zz  ceti mode amplitudes to the wavelength of the observations . at all wavelengths ,",
    "the observed amplitudes are diminished by cancellation between surface regions with opposite pulsation phase . in the ultraviolet ,",
    "stronger limb darkening changes the character of this cancellation and observed mode amplitudes differ from their optical values in a manner that depends on  .",
    "the models calculated by robinson et al .",
    "( ) to explore differences between ultraviolet and optical also show amplitude changes within optical absorption lines .",
    "the character of these changes likewise depends upon  , providing the potential to determine   from optical spectroscopy .    in an attempt to measure the line profile variations of  and use them for   identification",
    ", we acquired over four hours of time - resolved spectroscopy using the keck ii low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .  ) .",
    "we have described these observations in a companion paper ( van kerkwijk et al . ,",
    "paper  i ) , and presented an analysis of the periodicities present in the total flux and line - of - sight velocity curves . prior to our keck observations ,",
    "the velocity variations associated with zz  ceti pulsations had never been detected .",
    "their presence significantly complicates the models required to fully understand our data , but also increases the amount of valuable information we can hope to extract .    in this paper",
    "we present our analysis of the line profile variations of .",
    "we begin in , with an analysis of the average spectrum , which has a signal to noise ratio higher than usual for white dwarf spectra . in",
    "we present the amplitudes and phases as a function of wavelength for the largest modes and compare them to each other and to theoretical models like those calculated by robinson et al .",
    "( ) . on this basis alone it will be clear that we can unambiguously identify   for these modes .",
    "it will also be clear that good quantitative fits to the data will require improvements to model atmospheres .",
    "nonetheless , we will continue in by incorporating the velocity field associated with the pulsations into the models .",
    "the improved models help to constrain other pulsation properties , such as the velocity amplitude of motions at the stellar surface .",
    "we present our conclusions in .",
    "by averaging together all of our time - series spectra , we have constructed a mean spectrum with extremely high signal to noise ratio .",
    "this spectrum shows balmer lines ( h@xmath5 through h@xmath6 ) , the  @xmath7 resonance line , and a hint of  @xmath8 ( paper  i ) .",
    "metal lines were first discovered in  by koester , provencal , & shipman ( @xcite ) , who also found iron lines in the ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the presence of metals in a da spectrum is unusual , and koester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) attribute them to the accretion of dust , supporting the notion that the infrared excess in the spectrum of  is caused by reprocessing of light by circumstellar dust grains .",
    "we have fitted the balmer lines in our mean spectrum using a grid of model spectra kindly provided by d. koester ( for a recent description , see finley , koester , & basri @xcite ) .",
    "the models consist of tabulated intensities , @xmath9 , at 9 limb angles , @xmath10 , for a grid of atmospheres with effective temperatures spanning the zz  ceti instability strip and with gravities from @xmath11 to 8.75 .",
    "the atmospheres were all calculated using the ml2 , @xmath12 prescription for convection , which yields consistent fits for zz ceti stars over the broadest range of wavelengths ( bergeron et al .  ) . to compare the models to our spectrum we integrated @xmath9 over the visible hemisphere and compared the resulting balmer lines to those we observed by normalising both model and data to fixed continuum points .",
    "this method is similar to that used by bergeron , saffer & liebert ( @xcite ) , but less sophisticated than the procedure bergeron et al .",
    "( ) used for their analysis of zz  ceti spectra .    figure  [ fig : specfit ] shows the observed balmer lines along with the best fitting model , which has @xmath13  k and @xmath14 .",
    "these values are close to those published for  by bergeron et al .",
    "( ) and koester et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "the former found @xmath15  k and @xmath16 , the latter @xmath17  k and @xmath18 . using the evolutionary models of wood ( @xcite ) with thick surface h layers ( @xmath19 ) our values translate into a mass of 0.64 .    as impressive as the fit in figure  [ fig : specfit ] is ,",
    "the discrepancies between model and data are still dominated by systematic effects , rather than stochastic noise .",
    "this makes the values of @xmath20 we calculate useless for evaluating the error in our temperature and gravity determination ; the error is dominated by real differences between the models and the measurements .",
    "these differences might arise from a variety of sources .",
    "one possibility is that the normalisation of our data to the continuum points was affected by errors in our calibration of the instrumental response .",
    "another possibility is that errors arise from the presence of metal lines not included in the models .",
    "the shape of @xmath21 and h@xmath22 are probably affected by depression of the intervening continuum by the  @xmath7 line and h@xmath22 is contaminated by  @xmath23 .",
    "however , the metal lines can not entirely account for the problem , because the fits to h@xmath5 , h@xmath24 , and h@xmath25 , which should be unaffected by metals , are also less than perfect .",
    "the discrepancy in the fits might also be due to a problem discussed by koester , allard , & vauclair ( @xcite ) .",
    "they found that even the best prescription for convection yields a temperature structure in model atmospheres that is only approximately correct .",
    "consequently , the synthetic spectra the models produce will not match observed spectra at every wavelength simultaneously nor will they match all the line profiles , which are highly sensitive to the run of temperature with depth . to explore this possibility , and to see how our final fit is affected by individual lines ,",
    "we have fitted separate models to each of the balmer lines .    in figure",
    "[ fig : linefit ] , we plot the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the best - fitting models of the individual lines h@xmath5 through h9 .",
    "they span a range of temperature from 11,620 to 12,885  k. with the exception of @xmath28 , the fits show a trend to higher @xmath27 and lower @xmath26 as the excitation level increases .",
    "the location of the fit using all lines compared to the individual lines shows that the gravity fit is dominated by the lines of higher excitation , which are known to be more gravity sensitive .",
    "conversely , the temperature is fixed by the lower excitation lines , which change more rapidly with @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : linefit ] is not meant to suggest that the individual fits give answers inconsistent with the global fit , rather they should be regarded as helping to establish the uncertainty of the temperature and gravity determination .",
    "it is clear that high signal - to - noise ratio alone is not enough to improve the determination of temperature and gravity .",
    "better calibration of the instrument or improvements to the models ( or both ) will be necessary .",
    "the systematic trend in the individual balmer line fits suggests the problem lies with the models , as do the results of the following section .",
    "there we compare fractional amplitudes calculated from data and models , and find further discrepancies . in the fractional amplitudes , calibration errors should cancel to first order .",
    "if the models turn out to be responsible for the discrepancies we measure , our high signal to noise average spectrum will provide the opportunity to improve atmospheric models , perhaps even to infer the correct temperature profile .",
    "furthermore , individual spectra in our time series , which themselves have a signal to noise ratio of 100 , span a temperature range of about 500  k and will show how the atmospheric structure should change with model temperature .",
    "this information about the derivative of the thermal profile should provide extremely valuable constraints on model atmospheres .",
    "our data are available upon request to anyone interested in exploring these problems .",
    "the final factor that might affect our model fit is the presence of relatively large amplitude pulsations .",
    "we have shown in paper  i that the velocity fields associated with the pulsations of  are detectable in our data .",
    "these motions alter the average spectrum , mainly by doppler broadening the absorption lines very slightly .",
    "the models we will describe in allow us to incorporate this effect into the model spectrum .",
    "fitting the data with these velocity broadened spectra yields a slight improvement in the quality of the fit to the average spectrum , but an insubstantial change in the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 we infer from the models .",
    "robinson et al .  ( )",
    "have described and implemented a method for distinguishing the value of   in zz  ceti stars by comparing pulsation amplitudes at different wavelengths .",
    "their method relies upon the increased importance of limb darkening in the ultraviolet .",
    "non - radial pulsation modes of every   suffer from geometric dilution in their amplitudes when averaged over the visible hemisphere .",
    "this dilution increases with   as cancellation between regions with opposing phase becomes important .",
    "however , at short wavelengths increased limb darkening diminishes the effect of the cancellations . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the net result is that mode amplitudes increase in the ultraviolet relative to their optical values in a way that depends on   .",
    "robinson et al .",
    "( ) used optical and ultraviolet high speed photometry to measure this effect for the 215  s pulsation mode in 117-b15a .",
    "they were able to conclude that this mode is @xmath4 .",
    "fontaine et al .",
    "( ) reanalyzed the same data using independent models and arrived at the same conclusion , although they differed with robinson et al .  in the model temperature",
    "that best fits the data .",
    "the models robinson et al .",
    "( ) calculated also showed  - dependent differences in the behaviour of pulsation amplitudes within the absorption lines .",
    "these too arise from the effects of limb darkening on modes of different  .",
    "figure  [ fig : robmodels ] shows these changes for low values of @xmath30 , which are expected to dominate the modes observed in white dwarfs .",
    "we calculated these curves using a modified version of code originally provided to us by e. l. robinson ( see robinson et al .  ) . instead of integrating over a limb darkening law ,",
    "we integrate over intensities tabulated for different values of @xmath31 , as described in .",
    "consequently , equations  3a and 3b in robinson et al . , which represent the equilibrium flux and",
    "the flux changes due to the pulsations , become : @xmath32 and @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the equilibrium stellar radius , @xmath35 the equilibrium temperature , @xmath22 is the amplitude of the radius changes induced by the pulsations , and @xmath36 is the lagrangian derivative of temperature with respect to radius . together",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the surface distribution of the temperature changes after integrating in the @xmath39 direction .",
    "@xmath37 is a legendre polynomial depending only on @xmath31 , and @xmath38 depends on the angle between the pulsation axis and the observer s line of sight .",
    "our notation is slightly different from robinson et al .",
    "( ) in that we have separated the time dependence , @xmath40 , from @xmath38 .",
    "finally , while @xmath41 comes directly from the tabulated models , @xmath42 must be calculated by taking differences between models of different @xmath27 .",
    "robinson et al .",
    "( ) have emphasized the useful properties of the ratio @xmath43 for identification .",
    "it is not sensitive to the flux calibration of the data and varies with wavelength in a way that does not depend on mode inclination and  ( see also the appendix ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : robmodels ] we show @xmath43 for modes of @xmath4 through 4 .",
    "the curves have been normalised to one at 5500  .",
    "we have not included @xmath44 , which resembles @xmath45 with slightly smaller modulations , because it is clear from the long periods of the modes that they can not be radial pulsations .    in order to compare our data to the models in figure  [ fig : robmodels ] ,",
    "we have fitted the amplitudes and phases of the 11 largest pulsation frequencies in each 2   wavelength bin using the function @xmath46 . during these fits , we held the mode frequency , @xmath47 , constant at the values tabulated in paper  i , and fit the 11 amplitudes and phases simultaneously .",
    "of these 11 modes , five are combination frequencies , i.e. , frequencies which have values that are sums or differences of larger modes .",
    "we have discussed the nature of combination frequencies in paper  i and will return to them at the end of this section .",
    "figure  [ fig : amps ] shows the fractional amplitudes at each wavelength for the six physical modes and for the four largest combination frequencies .",
    "the fifth , f3@xmath48f1 at 10,322s , we judged too noisy to include .",
    "the qualitative similarity between the data and the models is striking . even in the line cores",
    "the models predict the behaviour of mode amplitudes quite well , despite the fact that within @xmath49  of the core non - lte effects in the atmosphere are important , which are not included in the model .",
    "we emphasize that these are predictions in the literal sense ; koester calculated the atmosphere models before we acquired the data .    in the models we have discussed so far , the pulsations have the same phase at every wavelength",
    "however , the phases of the physical modes , shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] , show distinct changes in the vicinity of spectral features . for mode f1 ,",
    "the phase changes within absorption lines bear the signature of a velocity induced variation ; they change with the derivative of the spectrum .",
    "we will return to these phase changes in , when we have models capable of reproducing them .",
    "in addition to the phase changes within the lines , figure  [ fig : phase ] also shows a small slope in the continuum phases , indicating that pulse maximum in blue light arrives earlier than in red by a few seconds .",
    "this slope is not reproduced by our models , and remains a mystery .",
    "careful inspection of the amplitudes of the real modes in figure  [ fig : amps ] reveals that those for mode f4 , at 776  s , show a different shape than for the other modes ; they increase more sharply in the line cores and curve more steeply in the continuum .",
    "f4 was already noticeably different from the other real modes in paper  i , where we found it had a larger velocity to light amplitude ratio than any of the other modes , and it produced a stronger harmonic .    to help see the differences in f4 we have normalised the amplitudes of f1 and f4 at 5500    and plotted the modes together in figure  [ fig:14comp ] .",
    "the most likely explanation for the differences we see is that f4 has a value of   different from f1 .",
    "qualitative application of the theoretical models demands that must be higher for f4 , to yield the larger changes in amplitude we observe .",
    "furthermore , the large contrast between modes of @xmath50 and higher in the models , versus the more modest differences seen in figure  [ fig:14comp ] , point toward the conclusion that f4 is @xmath51 and f1 is @xmath4 .    to test this possibility further",
    ", we can make a direct comparison between the data and models . in figure",
    "[ fig : ampfit ] we have plotted the theoretical and observed amplitudes for modes 1 , 2 , 4 , and  5 . to establish the normalisation , we multiplied the theoretical curves by the amplitudes of each mode at 5500   .",
    "we have used a model with gravity and equilibrium temperature inferred from our fit to the average spectrum in . as with the average spectrum ,",
    "figure  [ fig : ampfit ] shows discrepancies between the data and the models .",
    "the slope of the amplitude changes is steeper in the data than in the models , worsening the fit at short wavelengths .",
    "correcting this would require hotter models at shorter wavelengths , the same trend required to fit to individual balmer lines in the average spectrum .",
    "we could not find a model at any single temperature that offered a substantially better fit than the model we have used .    in spite of the difficulties with the fits ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath4 is a better match to modes f1 , f2 , and f5 while @xmath52 is a better fit to mode  f4 .",
    "interestingly , this is most apparent in the continuum variations between 4500 and 4700   ; the models are too poor a fit within the lines to provide a measure of   there .",
    "nonetheless , our original expectation that the line profiles would offer the most sensitive   discriminant are borne out by the large differences between the amplitudes at line center in f4 and those in the other modes .",
    "we have included f5 as the representative of the noisier low amplitude modes .",
    "even with the higher noise it is clear that @xmath4 is a better fit to this mode , as it is to every mode except mode  f4 .",
    "even though the quantitative agreement is poor at many wavelengths , the presence of two apparently different values of   makes our identification secure .",
    "the values of   chosen are independent of the model temperature . lowering the effective temperature of the model chosen diminishes the changes in mode amplitudes , so that at some @xmath53 , the @xmath50 model would fit mode f1 and those like it , but at that temperature , no value of   fits f4 .",
    "likewise , attempts to fit f4 with @xmath4 by increasing model temperature leave no   of lower value to fit the other modes . consequently , on the basis of qualitative behaviour alone",
    ", we can conclude that the 776  s mode is @xmath54 , and the remaining 5 modes are @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we consider the combination modes shown in figure  [ fig : amps ] .",
    "the combination frequencies we see in and other zz  ceti stars probably do not arise from eigenmode pulsations , but from a non - linear transformation of the modes in the outer layers of the white dwarf ( brickhill @xcite , cf .",
    "brassard , fontaine , & wesemael @xcite ) .",
    "this mixes the modes present , generating signals at sums and differences of the mode frequencies .",
    "the @xmath30 character of these modes depends on the @xmath30 of the modes which produce them .",
    "for example , we expect the combination of two @xmath55 modes to have @xmath44 and @xmath50 components , while those of two @xmath56 modes or two @xmath57 modes should produce only @xmath58 .",
    "these expectations arise from the mathematical properties of spherical harmonics only .",
    "it is impossible to make quantitative predictions about combination modes without a detailed theory explaining how they are produced .",
    "we have shown two combination frequencies along with models in figure  [ fig : combo ] . like the other combinations",
    ", they most resemble the modes we have identified as @xmath4 .",
    "we have already discussed the implications of this in paper  i.",
    "apart from the problems with quantitative fits to the model atmospheres , there is a significant qualitative difference between the observed and model amplitudes in figure  [ fig : ampfit ] ; the observed amplitudes are asymmetric within the absorption lines , while the model amplitudes are not .",
    "we showed in paper  i that the balmer lines not only show changes in flux during a pulsation cycle , but also changes in line - of - sight velocity . in that paper , we treated these as separable components of the spectral variations , but in reality they are components of a more complex line profile variation . in anticipation of improvements in the model",
    "fits , in this section we will calculate these variations by incorporating velocities into the flux integrals we calculate at each wavelength .",
    "this requires that we follow a more general treatment than that used by robinson et al .",
    "( ) to produce equation  [ eq : fl0 ]",
    ". our development will rely upon robinson , kepler , & nather ( @xcite ) and use the same notation where possible .",
    "the effect of the velocity field on our calculations of the integrated flux is that the values of @xmath9 we look up from the tabulated spectra , and the values of @xmath59 we calculate from them , must be chosen using wavelengths adjusted for the velocity of each surface element .",
    "thus @xmath9 in equation  [ eq : fl0 ] , and @xmath59 in equation  [ eq : dfl ] are now functions of velocity .",
    "since the velocity has a time dependence , both quantities are now also implicit functions of time .",
    "we may write the total flux at each observed wavelength as a function of time as :    @xmath60    where the @xmath35 is a reminder that the first term comes from the model at equilibrium temperature , and the @xmath53 indicates that the flux changes in the second term are due to changes in temperature , which dominate all other sources ( robinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . it will help in understanding equation  [ eq : flobs ] to think about two different limits .",
    "the first is a ( hypothetical ) pulsation mode which has surface motions but no temperature changes . for these modes ,",
    "the second term would be 0 .",
    "the first term would be a function of time for any @xmath61 near spectral features that could be doppler shifted in and out of @xmath61 by the changing velocities . the second limit to think of is a mode with temperature but no velocity variations , then the two terms in equation  [ eq : flobs ] reduce to the expressions given by equations  [ eq : fl0 ] and  [ eq : dfl ] .",
    "an important feature of equation  [ eq : flobs ] that is not present in equations  [ eq : fl0 ] and  [ eq : dfl ] is the possibility for the phase of flux maximum to differ from the phase of temperature maximum .",
    "this means the time of flux maximum can differ with wavelength , a possibility that was never allowed by equation  [ eq : fl0 ] .",
    "our expressions for the terms in equation  [ eq : flobs ] must also be more general than before .",
    "we can write @xmath62 generally as @xmath63 which is analogous to the expression used by kepler ( @xcite ) in his discussion of line profile variations due to _ r_-mode pulsations . as we have noted , the time dependent velocities enter into the wavelength @xmath64 , so @xmath65 is a function of time .",
    "likewise , @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the assumed functional form for the perturbations in stellar radius , @xmath69 @xmath70 is the spherical harmonic of degree @xmath30 and order @xmath71 in the coordinate system @xmath72 aligned with the pulsation axis , and @xmath73 is the pulsation frequency .",
    "compared with equation  [ eq : dfl ] , we have reverted to an expression in which the imaginary parts of the temporal and spatial dependences are included ; moreover , we have followed robinson et al.(@xcite ) in adopting an extra term @xmath74 to allow for the nonadiabatic effects which may introduce a phase difference between the radial displacement and the flux changes is positive for adiabatic pulsations , since maximum radial displacement corresponds to maximum temperature .",
    "this has no effect on any of the conclusions robinson et al .  presented . ] .",
    "the negative sign in the exponent indicates that for positive values of @xmath75 , maximum flux lags maximum radial displacement .    in equations  [ eq :",
    "fl0obs ] and  [ eq : dflobs ] , the value of @xmath64 should be the wavelength from which light is doppler shifted into @xmath61 , or , @xmath76 \\label{eq : l}\\ ] ] to first order .",
    "we use @xmath77 to express the velocity component projected into our line of sight .",
    "calculating @xmath77 requires first an expression for the pulsation velocities at the stellar surface .    in the frame of reference",
    "@xmath72 aligned with the pulsation axis , the components of the pulsation velocities are , following dziembowski ( @xcite ) , @xmath78 for _ g_-mode pulsations , @xmath79 is small compared to the other two and can be ignored .    to get @xmath77 requires transforming the remaining velocity expressions into our reference frame and projecting them along our line of sight",
    ". then equations  [ eq : flobs ] through  [ eq : l ] are all we need in principle to calculate colour - dependent pulsation amplitudes in the presence of non - zero velocities . in practice",
    ", this would be cumbersome and inefficient for arbitrary inclination and , so we have further simplified the problem by aligning the pulsation axis with our line - of - sight and holding @xmath80 .",
    "contrary to initial expectations , this simplification comes at almost no expense ; the results for this case scale easily to arbitrary choices for inclination and . in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate that this is true and show how the scaling is done .",
    "this simplification allows us to dispense with the expression for @xmath81 and to replace @xmath82 and @xmath83 in all equations with @xmath84 and @xmath39 for our reference frame .",
    "the @xmath39 dependences of @xmath77 , @xmath68 , and @xmath9 also disappear , and the spherical harmonics reduce to legendre polynomials .",
    "finally , to make our fits independent of the particular choices for stellar radius and pulsation frequency , we have introduced the fitting parameters : @xmath85 thus the final expressions we evaluate numerically are : @xmath86)\\;\\mu\\;\\d\\mu ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the free parameters in these equations are the temperature and gravity of the equilibrium model , @xmath35 and @xmath87 , the ( non - adiabatic ) phase shift @xmath75 , and the amplitudes given by equation  [ eq : amps ] .",
    "the equilibrium radius , @xmath34 , cancels when we calculate the fractional amplitude .",
    "we have modified the code originally provided by e. l. robinson to perform these integrals at a series of time steps covering one pulsation cycle .",
    "then we have convolved the output spectra with a gaussian to emulate seeing . finally , we have calculated the pulsation amplitude , phase , and mean spectrum at each wavelength .    in paper",
    "i , we defined the quantity @xmath88 as the phase difference between maximum light and maximum velocity . in the formalism of this paper , @xmath89 for the @xmath90 case ,",
    "where flux and radial displacement are in phase , the @xmath91 delay enters because of the time derivative used to get @xmath77 .",
    "positive values of @xmath75 then reduce @xmath88 by delaying the maximum light so that it arrives less than @xmath91 before maximum velocity . in all of the modes for which we can detect velocities , @xmath88 lies in the first quadrant , implying that flux maximum is delayed compared to the adiabatic case ( or velocity maximum advanced , which is harder to imagine ) .",
    "this is a profound result , and the first direct observational constraint on the behaviour of eigenmodes near the surface of a white dwarf star .",
    "comparing our models to the data presents something of a challenge , because of the generally poor match for any choice of amplitude and phase .",
    "we have simplified the problem by choosing the equilibrium temperature and gravity from our fit to the average spectrum .",
    "then we have fitted @xmath92 directly , by insisting that the fractional amplitude of the flux changes in our model match those in the data at 5500   . to choose appropriate values for @xmath93 and @xmath75",
    ", we used our model to calculate several time series of synthetic spectra and then we reduced them in the same way as the real data .",
    "this allowed us to calibrate the scaling introduced by the integrals in equation  [ eq : fl+dfl ] for various choices of  , @xmath93 , and @xmath75 .",
    "then we used these scale factors to generate models based on the properties measured for modes in paper  i. the size of the velocities we use to match our data is quite similar to the size predicted by robinson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , @xmath94  .",
    "figure  [ fig : profit ] shows the results of these calculations for the h@xmath5 line in modes f1 and f4 .",
    "our models now reproduce the asymmetry in the amplitude plots , and show phase changes within the line profiles .",
    "these phase changes could never be reproduced without including velocities in the models .",
    "however , the overall quality of the amplitude fits within lines is not much improved , and is not changed at all in the continuum .",
    "the phases are a good fit within spectral lines for the larger modes , but our models still do not reproduce the slow change in phase observed in the continuum ( see figure  [ fig : phase ] ) . for now , this remains a mystery , but probably a mystery hiding interesting pulsation physics .",
    "finally , we consider the behaviour of the ratio between the observed velocity and flux amplitudes . as we show in the appendix , this ratio does not depend on the inclination or  of the modes , and therefore can not be used to constrain those quantities .",
    "however , it is sensitive to the value of   as evident from the different forms for flux and velocity in the integrals of equation  [ eq : fl+dfl ] .",
    "the flux depends on the legendre polynomial while the velocity depends on its derivative and in addition is weighted towards the limb by the projection onto the line of sight . according to our models , for a fixed value of @xmath95 , an @xmath50 mode should have @xmath96 times higher apparent velocity to light ratio than an @xmath97 mode .",
    "it is then no surprise that mode f4 , which we have identified as @xmath50 , has the highest velocity to light amplitude ratio ( see paper  i ) of any of the modes we have detected , a result which supports our identification of that mode as @xmath50 .",
    "asteroseismology of zz  ceti stars has been impeded for almost two decades by the lack of a reliable method for mode identification . we have tested a new method that uses high signal to noise time - resolved spectroscopy to measure the wavelength dependence of optical pulsation amplitudes .",
    "we have found that the  - dependent changes in amplitude predicted by the models are also present in our data , allowing us to assign values of   to six modes in the star .",
    "initially , this will be of greatest benefit to seismological models of .",
    "none of the modes we have identified is short enough to yield immediate constraints on the mass of the h layer , as is possible for 117-b15a ( robinson et al .  ) , 165 ( bergeron et al .  ) , and 226 - 29 ( fontaine et al .  ) .",
    "however , a concerted effort to match the six modes of known   may yield a unique solution . if not , it is possible to return to this star with the hope that four more hours of data will allow identification of a different set of modes . sooner or later , we will have a definitive asteroseismological solution for this star ; the main obstacle has been removed .",
    "our method can also be extended to other zz  ceti stars , although the fainter , low amplitude stars will require longer runs .",
    "we have already begun a programme to identify   in as many stars as is practical in the observing time available to us .",
    "this programme should allow us to measure structural properties of enough stars to answer some long - standing questions about the da stars , such as the masses of the h and he surface layers , which have been the subject of some controversy ( shipman  @xcite ; fontaine & wesemael  ) .",
    "apart from the impact our results will have on zz  ceti seismology , they have also opened new windows into the surface physics of pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "we have measured two new diagnostics of the behaviour of pulsations near the photosphere : the amplitude of the pulsation velocities , and the phase lag between flux maximum and velocity maximum .",
    "these can be compared quantitatively with predictions of nonadiabatic pulsation theories ( e.g. , lee & bradley @xcite ; wu & goldreich @xcite ) , as well as with measurements for other stars .",
    "we have already detected velocity changes in one other star ( hl  tau  76 ) .",
    "finally , our high signal to noise measurements provide a serious challenge to the atmospheric model fits .",
    "there are significant discrepancies between the models and our average spectrum and between the models and the spectral changes caused by pulsation .",
    "we have not identified the source of these differences , but hopefully our data and future data like them will provide assistance to modelers in their continuing attempts to understand the atmospheres of white dwarf stars .",

    "the usual way to transform an arbitrary spherical harmonic into the coordinate system aligned with our line of sight is to recognise that the @xmath98 spherical harmonics of a given   form a complete basis set , so it is always possible to express an arbitrary spherical harmonic as a sum of spherical harmonics in our coordinate system , @xmath99 the coefficients @xmath100 are a function of the inclination angle ( see dziembowski @xcite ; robinson et al.@xcite ) .",
    "then the @xmath101 terms of the sum cancel to zero in any integration over the visible hemisphere , so that only the @xmath102 term aligned with our line of sight remains .",

    "however , if we expand @xmath104 in a taylor series about @xmath64 , @xmath105 do the same for @xmath106 , and use equation  [ eq : l ] , our expression for the time dependent flux becomes @xmath107 we have suppressed the g and t dependencies , which vanish upon choosing an equilibrium model .",
