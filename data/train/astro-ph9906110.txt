    "cyg x-1 has been identified as a binary system of @xmath2-day orbital period which contains an o@xmath5 iab supergiant and a compact object that is believed to be a black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed intense x - ray flux from this system is thought to be produced close to the black hole in an accretion disk which emits soft x - ray photons and in a hot corona ( @xmath6@xmath7 k ) that inverse - compton scatters low energy photons to higher energies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion flow from the supergiant is probably intermediate between roche - lobe overflow and stellar wind accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    two physically distinct states of cyg x-1 have been observed : the hard state and the soft state .",
    "most of the time , cyg x-1 stays in the hard state where its @xmath0@xmath8 kev luminosity is low and the energy spectrum is hard .",
    "every few years , cyg x-1 undergoes a transition to the soft state and stays there for weeks to months before returning to the hard state . during the transition to the soft state , the @xmath0@xmath8 kev luminosity increases , often by a factor of more than @xmath9 , and",
    "the energy spectrum becomes softer ( see reviews by @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ; also the @xmath10/asm light curves in fig .",
    "[ ltcall ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the total @xmath11@xmath12 kev luminosity remained unchanged to within @xmath13 during the @xmath14 hard - to - soft and soft - to - hard state transitions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hard state of cyg x-1 frequently exhibits short , irregular , absorption - like x - ray intensity dips .",
    "these dips usually last seconds to hours and seem to occur preferentially near superior conjunction of the x - ray source .",
    "they are often thought to be due to absorption in inhomogeneities in the stellar wind from the companion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most probable mass for the black hole is about @xmath8 @xmath15(@xcite ; see also @xcite for a slightly higher value ) .",
    "one of the larger uncertainties in the determination of the mass comes through the inclination angle @xmath16 , which remains relatively poorly constrained .",
    "the various existing techniques to determine @xmath16 , such as those using the variation of the polarization of the optical light , allow it to be in a wide range of @xmath17@xmath18 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-day orbital period of cyg x-1 may be detected via several effects . in the optical band ,",
    "this period manifests itself as radial velocity variations of the absorption / emission lines ( @xcite ) and as ellipsoidal light variation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "phase - dependent variations of the equivalent width of the uv lines of si iv and c iv have been reported by treves ( 1980 ) and attributed to the orbital motion of the x - ray heated region of the stellar wind .",
    "orbital modulations in the near - infrared @xmath19 and @xmath20 band ( @xcite ) and in radio at @xmath21 ghz ( @xcite ) have also been reported .",
    "the causes of these modulations are still speculative .",
    "x - ray orbital modulations in the hard - state data of several investigations show an intensity minimum around superior conjunction in the folded light curves",
    ". a @xmath22-day record of ariel 5 asm observations in the @xmath23@xmath24 kev band yielded an intensity minimum near superior conjunction even though the @xmath2 day period was not detected at a convincing level of statistical significance in a power density spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a broad dip near superior conjunction was confirmed in @xmath25 days of hard state data from the watch / eureca wide field x - ray monitor ( @xcite ) . in the @xmath26@xmath27 , @xmath27@xmath28 and @xmath28@xmath29 kev bands ,",

    "the width ( fwhm ) is @xmath33 of the period in the @xmath26@xmath27 kev band .",
    "it is unclear how this type of broad dip is related to the shorter irregular dips discussed previously .",

    "the advantages of @xmath1/asm observations lie in its relatively good sensitivity ( @xmath37 mcrab in a day ) , frequent data sampling ( @xmath38@xmath39 times a day ) and long baseline ( @xmath40 years ) . moreover , the fact that a long ( @xmath41 days ) soft state was observed by the asm in @xmath14 makes it possible to quantitatively compare the two states",
    ". an earlier report of the detection of the @xmath2 day period in the @xmath1/asm data was made by zhang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "our analysis focuses on the x - ray orbital modulation with the goal of investigating the cause of the broad intensity dip , an understanding of which may ultimately help constrain the system parameters .",
    "specifically , we present ( 1 ) the results of a periodicity search ; ( 2 ) the folded and individual orbital light curves ; ( 3 ) a comparison of the orbital modulations in the soft and hard states ; and ( 4 ) the results from a simulation of the orbital modulation caused by a partially ionized stellar wind from the companion .",

    "the asm consists of three scanning shadow cameras , each consisting of a coded mask and a position - sensitive proportional counter .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the shadow patterns from a @xmath42-s observation by one of the three cameras of the asm yields the source intensity in three energy bands ( @xmath36@xmath23 , @xmath23@xmath43 , and @xmath43@xmath27 kev ) .",
    "the intensity is usually given in units of the count rate expected if the source were at the center of the field of view in one of the cameras ; in these units , the @xmath36@xmath27 kev crab nebula flux is about @xmath44 asm ct / s .",

    ", the hard - state data are taken from a @xmath50-day interval ( mjd @xmath51@xmath52 ) and the soft - state data from a @xmath48-day interval ( mjd @xmath53@xmath54 ) .    in this paper ,",

    "periodicities in both the hard state and the soft state have been sought by means of lomb - scargle periodograms of both the light curves and the derived hardness ratios .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) was used to estimate the power density spectrum instead of the classic periodogram based on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) since the asm data points are unevenly spaced in time . in the lomb - scargle periodogram",
    ", a maximum in the power occurs at the frequency which gives the least squares fit of a sinusoidal wave to the data .",
    "we oversampled the spectrum so that the frequencies are more closely spaced than @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the total duration of the data used .",
    "the goal is to ensure the detection of a peak for a signal that is of border - line statistical significance and to best locate the peak .",

    "there is a distinct peak in the periodogram at a frequency that is consistent with cyg x-1 s optically determined orbital period , i.e. , @xmath60 days ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the peak is much more apparent in the periodograms of the hardness ratios than in those of the light curves .",
    "some of the periodograms also have a significant peak at the frequency of @xmath61 d@xmath62 , the first harmonic of the orbital period .",
    "there is a large peak at a very low frequency corresponding to a period of about @xmath63 days , which is consistent with the reported @xmath64 day period by priedhorsky , terrell , & holt ( 1983 ) and by kemp et al .",
    ". however , the temporal span of the asm data is too short to confirm this period ; it could simply be `` red noise '' .",
    "in fact , this peak is no longer distinct in the periodograms calculated using an extended set of data , i.e. , 860 days of hard state data .",
    "no other periodicities stand out at frequencies less than @xmath39 cycles per day except for the `` peaks '' at @xmath65 cycles per day which appear to be red noise ( the spectrum for frequencies larger than @xmath8 cycles per day is not shown ) .",
    "the data were folded modulo the orbital period of @xmath66 days to study the phase - dependent variations ( fig . [ fold ] ) .",
    "we used the orbital ephemeris reported recently by brocksopp et al .",
    "the most distinctive feature in the folded light curves is the broad intensity dip .",
    "it is seen in all energy bands and is centered on the superior conjunction of the x - ray source ( phase zero ) .",
    "the dip profiles are quite symmetric about superior conjunction .",
    "the fractional amplitude of the modulation in the light curves is larger in the lower energy band , which manifests itself as gradual spectral hardening during the dip .",
    "the fractional amplitudes of the dip relative to the average non - dip intensities ( phase @xmath67-@xmath68 ) are @xmath4% for @xmath36@xmath23 kev , @xmath69% for @xmath23@xmath43 kev , and @xmath3% for @xmath43@xmath27 kev .",
    "the widths ( fwhm ) are all about 27% of the orbital period .",
    "the corresponding fractional changes of hr@xmath55 and hr@xmath0 are about @xmath70% and @xmath3% respectively with similar widths .",
    "taking into account the variation of the non - dip intensity in the folded light curves , we estimated the uncertainty in the fractional orbital modulations to be less than @xmath71 .",
    "complex structures are evident within the dip for at least @xmath72 of the orbital cycles observed by the asm .",
    "the profile of the structure also seems to vary from cycle to cycle .",
    "as the asm data are unevenly sampled in time , we have found only a few orbital cycles that are relatively uniformly sampled .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ dip ] one such cycle of the hard state observations with time bins of @xmath73 day in the energy band @xmath36@xmath23 kev .",
    "there is a broad intensity dip at superior conjunction with substantial substructure . in particular , there are two narrow dips near superior conjunction : within a few hours , the intensities dropped by a factor of @xmath74 , and the hardness ratios ( hr1 ) increased by a factor of @xmath75 .",
    "this indicates that the dips were much less pronounced at higher energies as might be expected from an absorption process .",
    "these smaller dip - like structures are similar to those reported from previous missions .",
    "it is possible that the broad dip may be , partially or wholly , due to the superposition of smaller dips .",
    "we do not explore this possibility further because the study of such small dips ( at time scale of seconds to hours ) requires more frequent sampling around superior conjunction than is provided by the asm .",
    "in contrast with the hard state , lomb - scargle periodograms of the soft - state data show no large power at the orbital period compared with the neighboring powers ( fig .",
    "[ power_comp ] , left panel ) .",
    "neither were any other periodicities found in the frequency range of @xmath73@xmath8 cycles per day . at low frequencies , i.e. @xmath76 cycles per day , red noise is evident .",
    "for a direct comparison of the soft state data with the hard state data , we constructed periodograms for an @xmath48-day segment of the hard - state data that has a comparable number of data points ( fig .",
    "[ power_comp ] , right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath2 day orbital period is clearly detected in the hard state periodogram but is not obvious in the soft state .    in comparing periodograms",
    ", we use the normalized variance , i.e. , the observed total variance of the count rate divided by the average rate . for a sinusoidal modulation superposed on random noise , the expected height of a peak in the periodogram is then proportional to the product of the number of data points and square of the fractional modulation divided by the normalized variance ( see equation 21 in horne & baliunas 1986 ) . for the @xmath36@xmath23 kev band soft state data ,",
    "the normalized variance is @xmath77 that of the hard - state data .",
    "thus , for comparable fractional orbital modulations ( assumed to be nearly sinusoidal ) , we expect the signal power of the soft state to be @xmath78 times that of the hard state , or @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ power_comp ] ) .",
    "the absence of a peak with @xmath80 at the orbital frequency in the soft state data thus clearly excludes the presence of comparable fractional orbital modulations in the @xmath36@xmath23 kev light curves of the two states .",
    "the folded orbital light curves and hardness ratios for the soft state ( fig .",
    "[ fold_high ] ) also fail to reveal any significant broad dip or spectral hardening near superior conjunction .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the fractional rms amplitude of the x - ray orbital modulation of the two states was estimated from the classic periodogram ( power density spectrum estimated using fft ) of the same data used above .",
    "we have binned the data and filled data gaps with the average rate in order to apply the fft .",
    "it is well known that the rms variation of the source signal in the data can be estimated using the fft power spectrum assuming that the signal power can be properly separated out from the total power spectrum ( cf .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore relevant to study the distribution of the noise power in the periodogram . in the analysis below ,",
    "only the powers at frequencies @xmath81 cycles per day were considered because the noise power spectrum is relatively flat in this region .",
    "the powers were first divided by the local mean which was obtained from a linear fit to the power as a function of frequency .",
    "the scaled noise powers of both the soft and hard state data were found to be consistent with a @xmath82 distribution with @xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "we then assumed that modulation at the orbital period would yield peaks with the same widths in the power density spectrum from both states . on this basis , we derived the fractional rms amplitude of the orbital modulation for the hard state and an upper limit for the soft state for each asm energy band at more than @xmath83 confidence ( cf .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different time - bin sizes ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 days ) to check for consistency of the results .",
    "we found that in the @xmath36@xmath23 kev band , the fractional rms amplitude of the orbital modulation for the soft state is at most @xmath88 of that for the hard state .",
    "the @xmath23@xmath43 and @xmath43@xmath27 kev bands yield higher percentages .",
    "the broad dip in the folded light curves can not be attributed to a partial eclipse by the companion .",
    "the companion is a supergiant with a size more than @xmath89 times larger than the x - ray emitting region , so an eclipse of duration nearly @xmath90 of the orbital period would have to be total .",
    "neither can the dip be caused by absorption by neutral material with solar elemental abundances since the observed @xmath91 reduction in flux in the @xmath43@xmath27 kev band would then be accompanied by a flux decrease in the @xmath36@xmath23 kev band of more than @xmath92 as opposed to the observed @xmath93 .",
    "we have modeled the broad dip assuming that it is produced by absorption and scattering of the x - rays by a smooth isotropic stellar wind from the companion star .",
    "the wind is partially ionized by the x - ray irradiation .",
    "the x - ray modulation is then caused by changes in the optical depth along the line of sight to the black hole as a function of orbital phase .",
    "for simplicity , we did not consider possible complex structures in the wind , e.g. , the tidal streams which could account for the strong x - ray attenuation at late orbital phases ( @xmath94 ) in some other wind accreting systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our calculation",
    ", we neglected the influence of the uv emission from the optical star upon the ionization state of the wind as we expect it to have little effect on the x - ray opacity in the asm energy band .",
    "the radiatively driven wind model of castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ) was adopted in our calculation . in this model",

    "if we take the degree of ionization into account , the hydrogen column density could be much higher , which may account for the observed modulation in the batse band .",
    "our analysis of _ rxte_/asm observations of cyg x-1 leads to the following conclusions : there is a broad smooth dip in the folded orbital light curves of cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "the dip is symmetric about superior conjunction of the x - ray source .",
    "the depth of the dip relative to the non - dip intensity is around @xmath160 in the @xmath36@xmath23 kev band , @xmath161 in the @xmath23@xmath43 kev band , and @xmath91 in the @xmath43@xmath27 kev band .",
    "the fwhm of the dip is @xmath90 of the orbital period in the energy range @xmath36@xmath27 kev .",
    "individual light curves show complex structures around superior conjunction in the form of dips of shorter duration .",
    "finally , no evidence is found for orbital modulation during the @xmath14 soft state of cyg x-1 .",
    "we examined the possibilities that the broad dip is produced by the absorption of the x - rays by a stellar wind from the companion star .",
    "this model reproduces the observed light curves of the hard state well for inclination angles @xmath146 and can also explain the soft - state data if there was a reduction in the stellar wind density for the duration of the soft state .",
    "alternatively , the observed x - ray modulation in the hard state may be mostly due to the partial obscuration of a central hard x - ray emitting region by the accretion stream .",
    "the lack of the observed orbital modulation in the soft state can be attributed to a significant shrinkage in the size of the x - ray emitting region such that it is no longer obscured by the accretion stream .",
    "this model requires the accretion stream to have specific geometric properties , such as its scale height , width , and orientation . in both models ,",
    "the required hydrogen column density can reproduce @xmath162 orbital modulation due to electron scattering as observed in the batse data ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are very grateful to the entire @xmath163 team at mit for their support .",
    "we thank saul rappaport , ron remillard , and shuangnan zhang for many helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank tim kallman and patrick wojdowski for their help with using xstar program .",
