    "recently the increased interest in the properties of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 meson can be observed due to extensive experimental search of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 bound states performed e.g. at cosy  @xcite , elsa  @xcite , gsi  @xcite , jinr  @xcite , jparc  @xcite , lpi  @xcite , and mami  @xcite as well as intensive theoretical investigations e.g.  @xcite .",
    "properties of @xmath0 in nuclear medium are related with the effects of @xmath4 anomaly at finite density  @xcite , which is reflected in the large mass of the @xmath0 meson compared to the masses of the other members of the pseudoscalar meson nonet  @xcite , and with the @xmath3-@xmath0 mixing  @xcite .",
    "experiment  @xcite has provided already an important data for these studies  @xcite , with the most precise direct measurement of the total width of the @xmath0 meson @xmath5@xcite , and the first rough estimation of the @xmath0-n interaction from the excitation function of the cross section for the @xmath6 reaction  @xcite . here",
    "we describe an analysis of the data used earlier for @xmath7 determination in view of the extraction of the production cross - section for the @xmath0 meson @xmath1 in proton - proton collisions and an update of the @xmath1 values presented previously  @xcite .",
    "in the reported measurement the @xmath0 meson was produced in proton - proton collisions reaction and its mass was reconstructed based on the momentum vectors of protons taking part in the @xmath8 reaction which was measured at five different beam momenta using the  detector setup  @xcite installed at the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite in research centre jlich .",
    "the schematic view of the  detector setup is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : c11setup ] .",
    "the collision of a proton from the beam with a proton cluster target may cause an @xmath0 meson creation . in that case",
    "all outgoing nucleons have been registered by the  detectors , whereas for the @xmath9 meson identification the missing mass technique was applied . the cosy beam momentum and",
    "the dedicated zero degree  facility enabled the measurement at an excess energy down the fraction of an mev above the kinematic threshold for the @xmath9 meson production .",
    "modification of the  target system allowed to decrease effective beam momentum spread and therefore enabled precise determination of the access energy @xmath2 with the precision of 0.10 mev .",
    "good control of the systematic uncertainties was possible due to measurement performed at five different values of @xmath2 and monitoring of the beam and target properties  @xcite . on the other hand the achieved missing mass resolution in the order of the total width of the @xmath0 meson itself  @xcite improved significantly the @xmath0 production cross section measurement .",
    "the number of registered @xmath0 mesons was obtained from the missing mass spectra for each @xmath2 value and corrected for the detector geometrical acceptance and registration efficiency .",
    "the luminosity value was determined using comparison of the cross section of @xmath10 reaction determined by edda collaboration  @xcite and the number of registered elastically scattered protons .",
    "since @xmath1 measured at  was obtained with the luminosity determination based on the edda data available that time  @xcite , we updated these numbers accordingly to superseded data  @xcite .",
    "measurement at @xmath11  mev  @xcite was already reported with new edda data  @xcite , whereas spesiii  @xcite and disto  @xcite used different techniques for luminosity determination .",
    "meson production in the proton - proton collision as a function of the access energy @xmath2 for the @xmath6 reaction measured at :  ( solid circles - updated values of  @xcite , solid square - measurement  @xcite with usage of edda 2004 data  @xcite ) , spesiii ( open squares )  @xcite and disto ( open triangle )  @xcite .",
    "the solid line shows parametrization of the experimental data using formula  [ eq : colin].,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    the experimental data presented at fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] are compared to the analytical parametrization derived by fldt and wilkin  @xcite which takes into account final state interaction of the protons : @xmath12 where @xmath2 denotes the excess energy , @xmath13 beam momentum , @xmath14 proton mass .",
    "the parameters @xmath15  mev and @xmath16  mb denote the coulomb distortion and constant factor , respectively , and have been determined by fitting this formula to the experimental data .",
    "values of @xmath6 cross sections determined at  are gathered in the table  [ tab : updated ] apart of the new measurement reported here , which is still in the final stage of the analysis .",
    ".updated values of production cross - sections for the @xmath0 meson in proton - proton collisions measured at  detector  @xcite with statistical and systematic uncertainties , respectively .",
