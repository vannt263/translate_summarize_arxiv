    "in this paper we continue the construction of a class of singular solutions of the einstein - vlasov system which was started in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that solutions of the einstein equations coupled with suitable matter models can yield singularities in finite time .",
    "more precisely , the meaning of this statement is the following .",
    "solutions of the einstein equations are certain spacetime manifolds , which are characterized by suitable pseudoriemannian metrics .",
    "the usual terminology in general relativity is that it is said that there is a singularity if the corresponding spacetime has a metric that fails to be causally geodesically complete . by this",
    "it is understood that there is a timelike or null geodesic which , at least in one direction , can not be extended and has a finite affine length .",
    "one of the best known examples of singularities in general relativity is given by black holes .",
    "they are characterized by the presence of a event horizon which ensures that the singularity does not have an influence on distant observers . a singularity which is not covered by an event horizon , so that it is visible to distant observers , is known as a naked singularity .",
    "this type of singularity is physically problematic for the following reason . to say that the singularity is visible to distant observers means that there exist causal geodesics which approach the singularity in the past time direction and which in the future time direction enter regions where the density of matter and the gravitational fields become arbitrarily small and the geometry resembles that of the flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "these physical notions can be formulated mathematically using the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime . in general relativity",
    "causal influences propagate along causal geodesics and so a naked singularity leads to a situation where the singularity can have an influence on physical processes in distant regions .",
    "since we do not have a complete theory describing the physics at a singularity this means a breakdown of the ability of physics to make predictions .",
    "there is a situation which is a priori milder but which is problematic for a similar reason .",
    "this is where although there are no geodesics of the type characterizing a naked singularity there are families of causal geodesics which reach distant regions and come from regions where physical conditions are arbitrarily extreme .",
    "this can be made mathematically precise by saying that they come from regions where some geometrical invariants , such as the kretschmann scalar @xmath0 or the invariant @xmath1 built out of the energy - momentum tensor , become arbitrarily large . from the point of view of physics",
    "this is just as problematic as a naked singularity since we do not have a reliable theoretical control of physical phenomena in regimes far beyond those accessible to experiments .",
    "we denote this type of situation as a veiled singularity since it means intuitively that although there is not a singularity which is directly visible we can nevertheless make observations of a region where known theory is in danger of being invalid .",
    "this terminology is not intended to indicate that a veiled singularity need be associated with geodesic incompleteness .",
    "a situation like this is also present in the solutions of the einstein equations coupled to a massless scalar field with singular future light cones found by christodoulou @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note , however , that christodoulou s solutions have a significantly different causal structure from those we construct .",
    "there are three features of the solutions constructed in @xcite which could be seen as disadvantages from the point of view of their physical applicability and which should be improved if possible .",
    "the first is the fact which has already been mentioned that they are not asymptotically flat and thus do not represent isolated systems .",
    "the second is that the initial data from which they evolve is not smooth .",
    "the third is that the matter source used models massless particles like photons rather than ordinary matter . in this paper",
    "we remove the first disadvantage , leaving the other two for future investigation .",
    "the hope is that eventually the rough data can be approximated by smooth data and the massless particles by massive ones in such a way that the key dynamical properties of the solutions are preserved .",
    "in fact there is recent work which indicates that the case of massless particles may be of considerable interest in its own right as a physical model .",
    "there has been a detailed numerical study of gravitational collapse in that case which concentrates on type i critical collapse @xcite",
    ". type ii critical collapse , which might be related to the phenomena studied in the present paper , is only briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the fact that global existence for small initial data has been proved for asymptotically flat solutions of the einstein - vlasov system with massless particles @xcite is a strong indication of the robustness of this model .    next the basic mathematical set - up used in the paper will be described . in general relativity",
    "the dynamics of self - gravitating matter is described by means of solutions of the einstein equations coupled to other equations describing the matter content . the type of singularities which could arise depend very strongly on the type of matter model used in the system . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with collisionless matter , described by the vlasov equation .",
    "moreover , we will assume in addition that the point particles represented by the matter model have zero mass .",
    "the combined system of the einstein equations with this model of matter is the massless einstein - vlasov system .    in what follows we will consider solutions of the einstein - vlasov system where the particle density is not a bounded function , but a measure concentrated on some hypersurfaces that will be described in detail later .",
    "a consequence of this is that the einstein equations are not satisfied in classical form , but in a suitable distributional sense .",
    "there is a class of distributional solutions of the einstein - vlasov system which are equivalent to what is usually known in the literature as dust",
    ". dust solutions of vlasov systems have the property that there is a unique possible value of the velocity at each point of spacetime .",
    "the solutions considered in this paper are somehow more general than the usual dust solutions considered in the literature , because they have a set of admissible velocities at each point of the spacetime but the dimension of that admissible set of velocities is smaller than the total dimension of the phase space .",
    "moreover , the set of admissible velocities at a given spatial point is qualitatively different in different regions .",
    "the number of possible values of the radial velocity for fixed angular momentum is two , one or zero",
    ". the number changes at some particular points which will be referred to as turning points .",
    "there the support of the distribution function fails to be transverse to the fibres of the tangent bundle .",
    "some matter variables like the density and pressure become unbounded in a neighbourhood of the turning points . from this point of view the solutions considered in this paper",
    "are intermediate between dust and smooth solutions and hence will be called dust - like solutions .",
    "note that in contrast to dust they do have some velocity dispersion .",
    "the dimension of the support of @xmath2 in the tangent space at a given spacetime point is zero for dust , two for the solutions in this paper and three for smooth solutions of the einstein - vlasov system .",
    "there is a particular type of solutions of the einstein equations known as generalized einstein clusters , which were first studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these solutions can also be thought of as distributional solutions of the einstein - vlasov system for which the support of @xmath2 in the tangent space at a given spacetime point is one .",
    "a more detailed discussion about the relation between generalized einstein clusters and the einstein - vlasov system can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the solutions here it will be possible to describe the distribution of velocities for the particles at a given point using a function depending on one coordinate , while a general distribution of velocities compatible with the assumption of spherical symmetry would depend on two coordinates .",
    "the results of this paper are a continuation of those in @xcite . in that paper , a class of dust - like self - similar solutions of the einstein - vlasov system were obtained . those solutions do not have an event horizon anywhere in the spacetime .",
    "the difficulty with those solutions is that , due to their self - similar character , they can not asymptotically resemble the minkowski metric at large distances from the center . in this paper",
    "we show that it is possible to cut off the distribution of matter in a suitable manner outside a compact set and to obtain a solution of the einstein - vlasov system whose metric behaves asymptotically far away from the center like that of minkowski spacetime .",
    "in addition , the spacetime constructed in this paper will have the property that it is not geodesically complete and that horizons do not appear at any point of the spacetime .",
    "it is interesting to remark that for the solutions constructed in this paper , the distribution of matter away from the center for long times asymptotically approaches the distribution of one einstein cluster with all its mass contained in an interval @xmath3 with a density of matter @xmath4 which increases linearly with the distance to the center . a more detailed description of the matter distribution for long times , away from the center ,",
    "will be found in section 8 .    due to the mathematical complexity of the einstein equations many of the studies related to singularity formation for these equations",
    "have been carried out for spherically symmetric solutions . in spherical symmetry",
    "the einstein vacuum equations are non - dynamical due to birkhoff s theorem , which says that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution is locally isometric to the schwarzschild solution and , in particular , static .",
    "thus it is essential to include matter of some kind .",
    "a matter model which has proved very useful for this task is the scalar field .",
    "this is a real - valued function @xmath5 which satisfies the wave equation @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the einstein equations take the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci curvature of @xmath9 the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field equations were studied in great detail in a series of papers by d. christodoulou .",
    "this culminated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in this system naked singularities can evolve from regular asymptotically flat initial data .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that generic initial data do not lead to naked singularities .",
    "( a precise definition of naked singularities can be found in @xcite ) .    for the spherically symmetric",
    "einstein - scalar field equations it is known from the work of christodoulou @xcite that small asymptotically flat initial data lead to a solution which is geodesically complete and hence free of singularities . this small data result has recently been extended to the case without symmetry in @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there are certain large initial data for which it is known that a black hole is formed .",
    "the threshold between these two types of behaviour was studied by choptuik ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and many other papers since .",
    "this area of research is known as critical collapse .",
    "it is entirely numerical and heuristic and unfortunately mathematically rigorous results are not yet available .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we recall the system of partial differential equations which describes the einstein - vlasov system in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "we also proved that it is possible to reformulate the problem as a system of equations where the angular momentum does not appear explicitly and therefore the system can be reformulated in terms of one variable less .",
    "section 3 describes in a heuristic manner the construction which will be carried out in this paper and we state the main results . in this section",
    "we also give the precise definition of measured - valued solution which will be used in this paper .",
    "section 4 summarizes the main properties of the self - similar solutions constructed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , some additional asymptotic properties of the solution are also obtained .",
    "section 5 contains a description of the functional analysis properties which will be used in the proof of the main results of the paper .",
    "this section also contains the description of some auxiliary pdes which will be used in the proof of the main result .",
    "section 6 contains the fixed point argument which proves the main result of the paper .",
    "section 7 contains a description of the properties of the spacetime constructed in the paper .",
    "in particular , it is proved that the resulting metric is not geodesically complete and the absence of a horizon in the spacetime obtained .    in order to simplify the notation we will use the following convention .",
    "we will use generic functions @xmath10 depending on the variables @xmath11 i.e.@xmath12 however , on several occasions we will change to new variables @xmath13 by means of suitable diffeomorphisms @xmath14 this defines a new function @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 we will denote @xmath15 by @xmath10 for simplicity , since no risk of confusion will arise due to this .",
    "we recall here the system of partial differential equations which describe the solutions of the massless einstein - vlasov system in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "these equations have been summarized in @xcite and we will just refer to the corresponding formulas there .",
    "a convenient way of writing the metric for spherically symmetric spacetimes uses a modified version of the classical schwarzschild coordinates ( cf .",
    "@xcite):@xmath17 which is chosen so that @xmath18 this normalization implies that the time variable @xmath19 is just the proper time at the center @xmath20    due to the symmetry of the metric , a suitable way to describe the kinematic characteristics of collisionless matter is by means of the following quantities:@xmath21 where the upper index @xmath22 in @xmath23 stands for the tangential component .",
    "a convenient feature of the choice of variables ( [ coord ] ) is that the angular momentum variable @xmath24 is constant along characteristics .",
    "we will write the particle density as:@xmath25    then , using the fact that collisionless matter moves along the light rays associated to the metric ( [ met1 ] ) we obtain , that the particle density satisfies the first order pde ( cf .",
    "@xcite):@xmath26 where : @xmath27    we are assuming in ( [ s1e2 ] ) that we are dealing with massless particles . for massive particles we should replace ( [ s1e2 ] ) by @xmath28 but in that case some invariance properties under rescalings which will be used in the construction of the solutions in this paper would be lost .",
    "notice , however , that in the case of particles with velocities close to the speed of light ( [ s1e2 ] ) would be a good approximation for the particle energy , even in the case of massive particles .    using the energy - momentum tensor for collisionless matter ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , it turns out that einstein equations for gravitational fields become the following system of equations:@xmath29 where , using suitable normalizations for @xmath19 and @xmath30 we must use the following boundary conditions : @xmath31    the functions @xmath32 in ( [ s1e3 ] ) encode all the relevant information in the energy - momentum tensor . in the case of collisionless matter",

    "such solutions are the self - similar solutions studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the metric associated to those solutions is not asymptotically flat as @xmath37 the solutions obtained in this paper will be obtained by replacing the distribution of collisionless particles for @xmath38 with @xmath39 of order one , by another distribution , with a smaller number of particles . as a consequence",
    ", it will not be possible to analyze the differential equations for the particle distribution @xmath2 by means of odes , but on the contrary , a more involved analysis , which requires understanding the behaviour of some hyperbolic systems , will be required",
    ". this analysis will be the main contribution of this paper .      due to the fact that we consider a system of massless particles",
    ", we can reformulate ( [ s1e1])-([s1e8 ] ) as a system of equations where the variable @xmath24 does not appear .",
    "more precisely , we can obtain a simpler , but equivalent pde system , where the unknown function @xmath2 depending on the variables @xmath40 is replaced by a new function @xmath41 which depends only on three variables @xmath42 to this end we define a new variable : @xmath43    making the change of variables @xmath44 and denoting the new distribution function by @xmath2 with a slight abuse of notation we can transform the system ( [ s1e1])-([s1e8 ] ) into : @xmath45 dv,\\ p=\\frac{\\pi}{r^{2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left [   \\int_{0}^{\\infty}f\\frac{v^{2}}{\\tilde{e}}fdf\\right ]   dv .",

    "the solution that we construct in this paper is obtained by means of a suitable perturbation of the self - similar solutions obtained in @xcite .",

    "the rationale behind the cutoff procedure used is that in the limit @xmath84 most of the mass is concentrated in the curve @xmath85 actually , the fact that the spacetime associated to the self - similar solution is not asymptotically flat as @xmath86 is due to the infinite amount of mass contained in @xmath85 on the other hand the curve @xmath87 contains a small fraction of the mass that tends to zero as @xmath88 it is then natural , in order to obtain a solution containing a finite amount of mass , to cut off the branch @xmath89 at some value of the radius @xmath90 due to the fact that in spherically symmetric situations the gravitational fields at a given radius @xmath91 depend only in the distribution matter at radii @xmath92 it follows that the dynamics of the branches @xmath93 is not modified for @xmath94 and it agrees with the dynamics obtained for the self - similar solutions .",
    "however , the gravitational fields are modified for @xmath95 and as a result the dynamics of the particles placed in the branch @xmath87 must be modified for @xmath96 our construction will then provide a measured - valued solution of ( [ s1e3 ] ) , ( [ s1e4 ] ) , ( [ s3e7 ] ) , ( [ s3e10 ] ) supported in the union of two curves @xmath97 with @xmath98 satisfying:@xmath99 where @xmath100 is a transformation from the half - plane @xmath101 to @xmath102 given by ( [ f1e3 ] ) for any @xmath103    notice that the intersection of the support of the solution obtained with the set @xmath104 is just @xmath105 the solution obtained is not self - similar for @xmath95 due to the presence in the problem of a length scale @xmath106 on the other hand it is also worth noticing that due to the change of the spacetime structure for @xmath95 the most suitable time variable to describe the dynamics of the region @xmath95 is not @xmath107 but the new time variable @xmath108 that basically corresponds to the minkowski time for @xmath37 in this time variable the formation of the singularity takes place for proper times approaching infinity . on the contrary , at the center @xmath109 the formation of the singularity will take place in finite proper time .",
