    "we have elected to investigate this further , in order to quantify the age difference ( if any ) between the thin disk , the thick disk and the halo of the milky way .    in recent years , numerous techniques have been employed to determine the ages of the oldest stars in the galactic ( thin ) disk .",
    "@xcite examined the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of hipparcos field stars and arrived at a minimum disk age of 8 gyr ; @xcite used isochrone fits to determine the ages of several old open clusters . @xcite and @xcite used observations of local white dwarfs and theoretical white dwarf cooling curves to determine a local disk age of @xmath4 gyr and @xmath5 gyr respectively .",

    "our best attempt at a fit is shown in figure [ figbe17 ] .",
    "as this is clearly not an acceptable fit to the data , we are unable to assign an age to be 17 .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for the inability of the isochrones to simultaneously fit the  and  data .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) a non - standard extinction law in the direction of be 17 ( ie .",

    "open clusters are expected to dissipate / disrupt in the galactic plane .",
    "thus , only the most massive open clusters or those with orbits which keep them far away from the plane for most of their lifetimes are expected to survive for signficant periods of time .",
    "for this reason , the age of the oldest field stars in the thin disk may provide a better estimate for the age of the thin disk than open clusters .",
    "an analysis of the age of oldest thin disk stars in the solar neighborhood was made by comparing solar metallicity isochrones to a selected sample of field stars from the hipparcos database @xcite .",
    "the hipparcos database was searched for single , non - variable stars with good parallaxes ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "in addition , choosing a relatively narrow metallicity range makes the age determination process simple .",
    "the selected stars were then plotted on a cmd and compared to solar metallicity isochrones .",
    "as many of the stars do not have i band photometry , the comparison to the isochrones was only done in .",
    "we are interested in determining the onset of star formation in the thin disk , and so concentrated our attention on the oldest stars in our sample for which it is possible to determine ages .",
    "these are the faintest stars in the main sequence turn - off or subgiant branch regions of the cmd .",
    "there were 21 stars which appeared to be old in our search of the hipparcos database .",
    "these 21 stars were checked for other published metallicities and space velocities .",
    "some stars were omitted from the sample which were shown in other sources to have metallicities of more than 0.07 dex from solar @xcite or shown to have space velocities which are not characteristic of the thin disk @xcite .",
    "the resulting sample of stars are shown in figure [ fighipp ] along with our zero - age main sequence and 6  8 gyr isochrones ( all with @xmath1$}}= 0.0 $ ] ) .",
    "figure [ fighipp]b reveals that there are 3 stars which are much brighter / redder than our main sequence isochrones .",
    "there a few possible reasons for this discrepency , including that these stars are binaries , or are more metal - rich than indicated by the 1996  catalogue",
    ". we will not determine the age of these three stars .",
    "an inspection of the oldest stars in the main sequence turn - off and subgiant branch region in figure [ fighipp]b reveals that 2 stars lie on the 8 gyr isochrone , 4 stars lie on or very near the 7 gyr isochrone and 1 star lies between the 7 and 8 gyr isochrone .",
    "the derived ages for the stars in the turn - off region are quite sensitive to possible errors in the colors of the stars .",
    "for example , if the  color of the 8 gyr star with @xmath32 was changed from and @xmath33 to @xmath34 then its age would be changed to 7 gyr .",
    "given the uncertainties in the photometry , reddening , and in our color transformation we are reluctant to base our estimate for the age of the oldest stars in the thin disk on just two stars .",
    "for this reason , we estimate that the oldest stars are @xmath35 gyr old .",

    ", we simply added in quadrate the @xmath37 gyr error due to the uncertainty in the metallicity of the stars with the @xmath37 gyr uncertainty due to the photometry / reddening and color transformation .",

    "these cuts were made rather generous to ensure that all potentially older stars are included in the sample .",
    "these cuts resulted in a sample of 21 stars which were plotted on a cmd with isochrones of appropriate metallicities .",
    "stars which were less than @xmath41 gyr old were deleted from further study .",
    "this left a sample of 16 stars .",
    "basic data for each of these 16 stars was retrieved from the simbad database at cds .",
    "four stars which were classified as variables or spectrospic binaries were removed from list as it would not be possible to determine their ages .",
    "the derived ages are quite sensitive to the metallicity of the star .",
    "for this reason , the references were checked for each star and 3 stars whose recent ( post 1995 )  determinations were significantly different than those listed in the 1996  catalogue were removed from the list .",

    "for example , in the thin disk @xmath57 km / s while in the thick disk @xmath58 km / s @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath48 velocity of hd 41330 ( @xmath59 km / s ) implies that it could be member of the thick or thin disk . by considering all of the kinematic and orbital parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) one can classify a star as either a thin or thick disk star , bearing in mind that these classifications will never be 100% accurate .",

    ", we believe that it is likely that at least one of these two stars is a true member of the thin disk .",
    "these stars are located in a region of the cmd where the derived ages are relatively insensitive to the metallicities , colors and absolute magnitudes . consequently , the derived ages have very small error bars . averaging the ages of these two stars together",

    "the small relative ages between the thick disk and inner halo ( table [ tabresults ] ) provide evidence that star formation in these regions began at roughly the same time .",
    "figure [ figfehage ] shows the relative ages versus metallicity of all the clusters discussed in this study .",
    "it is interesting to note that the very metal - rich open cluster ngc 6791 is @xmath101 gyr younger than 47 tuc .",
    "this old open cluster has an orbit which makes its classification as a thin disk object somewhat problematic .",
    "in particular @xcite report that this cluster has a rotation velocity @xmath47 which is 60 km / s lower than the thin disk and it is moving radially outward with @xmath102 km / s resulting in a orbit with a large eccentricity .",
    "however , this work assumed a considerably larger distance than was found by cgl ( 5.3 vs.4.2 kpc ) .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated the kinematic and orbital parameters of ngc 6791 using the distance found by cgl ( 4.2 kpc ) , the radial velocity from @xcite ( @xmath103 km / s ) and the preliminary proper motions from @xcite .",
    "we find the following : @xmath104 km / s ; @xmath105 km / s ; @xmath106 km / s ; @xmath107 kpc km / s ; @xmath108 kpc ; @xmath109 kpc ; @xmath110 kpc ; @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the orbit is fairly eccentric with a low rotation velocity and a reasonably large @xmath53 suggesting that ngc 6791 is a thick disk object .",
    "however , @xcite caution that clusters like ngc 6791 may simply be in the wings of the kinematic distribution of the thin disk , and its peculiar orbit is what has allowed it to survive .",
    "table [ tabresults ] includes the median distance of the stars / clusters from the galacic center ( @xmath113 ) based upon the orbits of the stars / clusters .",
    "we see that all of the thick disk and thin disk objects we have discussed in this paper cover a relatively modest range in their distance from the galactic center ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , all of these object were born at reasonably similar galacto - centric distances at so their ages reflect the star formation in small region of the galaxy .",
    "the 3 inner halo clusters discussed by csa turn out to have a fairly wide range in @xmath113 ( 2 to 18 kpc ) .",
    "the fact that the 47 tuc has a similar age to these clusters suggests that globular cluster formation was occuring at about the same time over a wide range of galacto - centric distances    there have been many proposed scenarios of galactic formation .",
    "these scenarios include the free - fall collapse of a protogalactic cloud , originally proposed by @xcite , and the merger of independently formed stellar systems @xcite .",
    "although no definative conclusions about galactic formation can be drawn from the results of this study , some possibilities can be presented .",
    "the similarity in age between the inner halo and thick disk indicates that if the thick disk was formed from the gravitational collapse of the halo , this collapse occurred on short timescales ( @xmath115 gyr ) .",
    "there is a clear age gap of several gyr between solar metallicity stars in the nearby thin disk and the thick disk ( 47 tuc ) .",
    "the age gap between moderately metal - poor thin disk stars and the thick disk is much smaller , and the present uncertainties in the age determinations allow for the possibility that the thin disk formed immediately after ( @xmath116 gyr ) after the thick disk and halo .",
    "we are extremely gratefull to dana dinescu for providing us with the routines to calculate space velocities of the field stars , for calculating the orbits of the stars and for cross - referencing her membership list for ngc 188 with the photometry from sarajedini et al .",
    "we would like to think the anonymous referee and the editor jim liebert whose numerous suggestions led to a considerable improvement in this paper .",
