    "the nuclear double beta decay ( dbd ) is an unique laboratory to investigate the nature and properties of the neutrino @xcite . the neutrinoless decay mode ,",
    "if it exists , would provide an unambiguous evidence of the majorana nature of the neutrino , its non - zero mass , and the non - conservation of lepton number .",
    "after the definitive confirmation that neutrinos have indeed non - zero mass , as the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation results imply @xcite , the neutrinoless double beta decay ( dbd ) has become a most relevant subject of research because it is a process able to provide , in a relatively short time , the neutrino mass scale and its hierarchy pattern .",
    "the current best sensitivity limits of the effective majorana electron neutrino mass -derived from the neutrinoless half - life lower bound- stands around @xmath9 mev @xcite ( the dispersion range is due to the uncertainties in the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements ) , whereas most of the neutrino mass models indicate that the mass region where the majorana nature of the neutrino would be resolved lies two orders of magnitude below ( @xmath1 a few mev ) . to achieve the sensitivity required for such new objectives",
    ", it will require a large number of double beta emitter nuclei , a very low background and a sharp energy resolution in the q - value region , and/or methods to disentangle signal from noise .",
    "a typical example of this type of search is igex .",
    "the international germanium experiment ( igex ) has been running in the canfranc underground laboratory at a depth of 2450 m.w.e . in a search for the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "details and results of the experiment can be found in ref .",
    "three germanium detectors ( rg1 , rg2 and rg3 ) , of @xmath12 kg each , enriched to 86% in @xmath0ge were used .",
    "this paper presents the development and application of one technique used to reduce part of the radioactive background by discriminating it from the expected signal by comparison of the shape of the pulses ( psd ) of both types of events . as an example , the method has been applied to the data recorded by two ge detectors of the igex collaboration , which has produced one of the two best current sensitivity limits for the majorana neutrino mass parameter @xcite .",
    "the rationale for psd is quite simple : in large intrinsic ge detectors , the charge carriers take 300  -  500 ns to reach their respective electrodes .",
    "these drift times are long enough for the current pulses to be recorded at a sufficient sampling rate .",
    "the current pulse contributions from electrons and holes are displacement currents , and therefore dependent on their instantaneous velocities and locations .",
    "accordingly , events occurring at a single site ( @xmath10-decay events for example ) have associated current pulse characteristics which reflect the position in the crystal where the event occurred . more importantly ,",
    "these single - site events ( sse ) frequently have pulse shapes that differ significantly from those due to the background events that produce electron - hole pairs at several sites by multi - compton - scattering process , for example ( the so - called multi - site events ( mse ) ) .",
    "consequently , pulse - shape analysis can be used to distinguish between these two types of energy depositions : dbd events belong to the sse class of events and will deposit energy at a single site in the detector while most of the background events belong to the mse class of events and will deposit energy at several sites .",
    "the igex detectors have modified preamplifier electronics to route and record the current pulses at a very early stage of preamplification , thus producing unique high - bandwidth pulse shape signals .",
    "furthermore , to develop psd techniques it would be highly desirable to obtain an earlier signal , even before it passes through the few unavoidable electronic components at the first stage of the detector preamplifier , resembling as much as possible the displacement current of the detector .",
    "this allows the development of algorithms that do not depend strongly on the preamplifier electronics in use . to this end",
    ", the transfer function of the preamplifier and associated front - end stage has been measured for each detector .",
    "this allows the reconstruction of the displacement current and an easy comparison to computed pulse shapes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ ecp ] , the properties of the digitized experimental pulses are shown and the work performed to understand and reproduce their shapes is presented . in section [ methods ] , the psd method is described . finally , section [ results ] displays the results of this analysis for the igex data .",
    "the data acquisition system of the igex experiment is based on standard nim electronics , each ge detector having an independent electronic chain .",
    "preamplifiers were modified for pulse shape analysis and each preamplifier fast - pulse output is routed to a lecroy 9362 digital oscilloscope ( 800 mhz analog bandwith ) .",
    "the digitized pulse signal covers a total time of 1 @xmath11s using 500 points ; it is worth noting that the time resolution , of about 100 ns ( as inferred from the width of the peaked features or the fall time ) , limits the ability to resolve nearby features in the pulse such as lobes or discontinuities characteristic of a multiple - site interaction signal .",
    "figure [ properties ] shows the main features of the digitized pulses .",
    "these output pulses are taken at the very first stage of the amplification chain , but even so , there is an unavoidable instrumental distortion due to the preamplifier .",
    "this has been studied to determine its transfer function @xmath12 . to take into account this distortion in the pulse shape analysis ,",
    "either the calculated pulse @xmath13 is folded with the transfer function , @xmath14 or the experimental signal unfolded .",
    "the latter allows the recovery of some information lost because of the instrumental distortion @xcite .",
    "the transfer function of the preamplifiers , @xmath12 , depicted in figure [ transfer ] , has been directly measured as the response of the preamplifier for a narrow @xmath15-like signal .",
    "studies were also made following several methods including analog simulation of the preamplifier circuits and the analysis of the shapes of selected populations of experimental pulses .",
    "it was observed that the shape of the rise and the fall of the folded pulses is the same that the shape of the transfer function for those events in which the energy is released in some particular regions of the crystal ; in particular , the left side of the transfer function can be deduced by studying pulses of events in the inner and lower part of the crystal , while the right side is derived from those produced in the outer and upper region .",
    "measurements and estimates for the transfer function are found to be in quite good agreement .",
    "the pulse shapes of the output signals can be reproduced numerically .",
    "an energy deposition in a ge crystal produces a proportional number of electron - hole pairs , which move towards the electrodes .",
    "the induced current @xmath16 , and consequently the electric pulse taken from the detector , is the sum of the contributions due to each type of charge carriers : @xmath17 the current is calculated as @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called weighting field . in principle , the drift velocity @xmath20 of charge carriers is proportional to the electric field @xmath21 : @xmath22 , where @xmath11 is the mobility in the material medium .",
    "however , at high values of the electric field , a saturation velocity is reached .",
    "the dependence of the velocity on the electric field has been obtained empirically @xcite : @xmath23    the values commonly used for the parameters involved in expression [ ve ] ( the mobility @xmath11 , the numerical parameter @xmath24 and the electric flield for saturation @xmath25 ) are summarized in table [ parve ] @xcite .",

    "a pulse shape discrimination technique to reject the radioactive background in the region in which the double beta decay signal is expected has been developed and applied to the data collected in the igex experiment , searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of @xmath0ge .",
    "a satisfactory understanding of the pulse shapes has been achieved .",
    "the method described in this paper is based on the counting of the number of lobes of the pulses , using a proper filter .",
    "it has provided a rejection of @xmath1 60 % of the events in the region of interest , accepting the criterion that those events having more than two lobes can not be due to a double beta decay .",
    "accordingly , the improved background levels provided by the psd technique have allowed the improvement of the limits for the half - life of @xmath0ge and consequently , the effective electron neutrino mass bound .",
