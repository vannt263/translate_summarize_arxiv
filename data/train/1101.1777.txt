    "<S> in this paper we study conditions for the vanishing of abelian integrals on families of zero - dimensional cycles . </S>",
    "<S> that is , for any rational function @xmath0 , characterize all rational functions @xmath1 and zero - sum integers @xmath2 such that the function @xmath3 vanishes identically . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 are continuously depending roots of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a notion of ( un)balanced cycles . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is an inductive solution of the problem of vanishing of abelian integrals when @xmath6 are polynomials on a family of zero - dimensional cycles under the assumption that the family of cycles we consider is unbalanced as well as all the cycles encountered in the inductive process . </S>",
    "<S> we also solve the problem on some balanced cycles .    </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation for our study is the problem of vanishing of abelian integrals on single families of one - dimensional cycles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our problem and our main result are sufficiently rich to include some related problems , as hyper - elliptic integrals on one - cycles , some applications to slow - fast planar systems , and the polynomial ( and trigonometric ) moment problem for abel equation . </S>",
    "<S> this last problem was recently solved by pakovich and muzychuk ( @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is largely inspired by their work , thought we provide examples of vanishing abelian integrals on zero - cycles which are not given as a sum of composition terms contrary to the situation in the solution of the polynomial moment problem . </S>"
