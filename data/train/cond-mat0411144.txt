    "in recent years , characterizing the energy landscape of a system in order to gain a better understanding of its behaviour has become an increasingly popular research approach,@xcite with many applications in the fields of protein folding,@xcite clusters and supercooled liquids.@xcite for example , a common explanation for how proteins are able to overcome the levinthal paradox@xcite and fold to their native state on biologically reasonable time scales is in terms of a funnel - like energy landscape .    here , we want to take a somewhat different approach and focus not on the relationship between the landscape and a system s behaviour , but on some of the fundamental properties of potential energy landscapes .",
    "for example , the number of minima increases exponentially with system size @xcite and the size scaling for higher - order saddle points has also been obtained.@xcite it is also known that the distribution of minima should be a gaussian function of the potential energy.@xcite    in this paper we seek to provide fundamental new insights into the structural organization , and particularly the connectivity , of an energy landscape . to achieve this",
    "we first map the landscape onto a network , and then analyse the topology of this network for a series of small clusters for which complete networks can be obtained . a brief report of some of this work has already appeared.@xcite    our analysis of these networks is heavily influenced by the literature on complex networks.@xcite the recent interest in this area was in part sparked by the seminal paper of watts and strogatz,@xcite who showed that many real - world networks have features that are typical both of a lattice ( the presence of local order ) and of a random graph@xcite ( short average separations between the nodes ) , and introduced a ` small - world ' network model that could represent both these features .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown that many networks also have a probability distribution for the number of connections to a node ( in network parlance , the degree distribution ) that has a power - law tail .",
    "such ` scale - free ' networks@xcite have been found in an impressively diverse range of fields , including astrophysics,@xcite geophysics,@xcite information technology,@xcite biochemistry,@xcite ecology@xcite and sociology.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : eland_net ] we explain how energy landscapes can be described in terms of networks . in section [",
    "sect : results ] we present a detailed characterization of these networks .",
    "this analysis initially focusses on whether the networks show small - world and scale - free behaviour , before going on to look at more subtle features of these networks .",
    "then , in section [ sect : discuss ] we discuss the implications of our results for understanding the dynamics on complex energy landscapes .",
    "to model an energy landscape as a network one must first decide on a definition both of a state of the system and how two states are connected .",
    "the states and their connections will then provide the nodes and edges of the network . for systems with continuous degrees of freedom , perhaps the most natural way to achieve this is through the ` inherent structure ' mapping of stillinger and weber.@xcite in this mapping each point in configuration space is associated with the minimum ( or ` inherent structure ' ) reached by following a steepest - descent path from that point .",
    "this mapping divides configuration space into basins of attraction surrounding each minimum on the energy landscape , and is illustrated for a model two - dimensional energy landscape in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] .    for systems with large numbers of degrees of freedom ,",
    "the energy landscape is an extremely complicated multi - dimensional function .",
    "the inherent structure approach provides a way of dealing with this complexity by breaking the landscape up into more manageable pieces .",
    "for example , good approximations to the partition function of a basin of attraction and to the rates of transitions between two basins can be obtained within the harmonic approximation ( and if necessary with additional anharmonic corrections ) , thus allowing thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a system to be calculated.@xcite    the inherent structure approach also provides a natural partition for the dynamics of a system . at sufficiently low temperature , the system will spend most of its time oscillating within a basin of attraction surrounding a minimum with occasional hops between basins along a transition state valley.@xcite this interbasin dynamics can then be represented as a walk on a network , whose nodes correspond to the minima and where edges link those minima that are directly connected by a transition state ( a first - order saddle point ) .",
    "such a network is illustrated for the model surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] , and we will term them inherent structure networks .        in chemistry such networks",
    "are often called reaction graphs , and have been used to analyse isomerization in small molecules and clusters . in these applications ,",
    "each permutational isomer of a structure is usually considered separately .",
    "for example , in ref .   the reaction graph connecting the eight permutational isomers of water dimer is depicted .",
    "such knowledge is for example important for understanding the pattern of splittings that results from tunnelling between these isomers .    for an atomic cluster with a single atom type",
    "the number of permutational isomers of a minimum is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the order of the point group of that minimum .",
    "this factor makes consideration of the network with a node for each permutational isomer unfeasible for all but the smallest sizes .",
    "for example , for a 7-atom lennard - jones ( lj ) cluster the four geometrically distinct minima give rise to 8904 permutational isomers , but for lj@xmath2 the 4196 geometrically distinct minima give rise to @xmath3 permutational isomers .",
    "hence , here we consider the network where each geometrically - distinct minimum is represented by a single node . indeed , this approach is perfectly reasonable , because one is usually only interested in the structure of the system , and not in the permutational order .",
    "the network we consider here will also be unweighted , i.e.  we are only interested in whether two minima are connected , and not in the weight , however defined , of this connection .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some properties of these randomized networks are given in table [ table : random ] .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : sw](b ) shows that although the randomized networks have a significantly higher clustering coefficient than the erds - renyi random graphs , the values for the inherent structure networks are yet still higher .",
    "this result disproves dorogovtsev and mendes assertion@xcite and shows that there are additional sources of local structuring , over and above that due to the degree distribution .",
    "by contrast , in figure [ fig : sw](a ) , which compares @xmath4 for the cluster networks and their randomized versions , only very small differences are apparent , showing that this property primarily reflects the degree distribution of the networks .",
    "however , it is noticeable that @xmath5 is always systematically smaller , albeit by a small amount , except for lj@xmath6 .",
    "this reflects the general correlation between higher clustering and longer path lengths , as seen , for example , in the extremes of the erds - renyi random graphs ( low @xmath7 , small @xmath4 ) and lattices ( high @xmath7 , large @xmath4 ) . in a network with higher clustering ,",
    "edges are ` wasted ' connecting nodes that are already close , which might have been used to connect distant nodes and hence lower @xmath4 more significantly .    in",
    "the following we will only show data for the randomized networks when they show significant differences from the inherent structure networks .",
    "typically , there will only be very small differences for properties related to the shortest paths on the networks , as with @xmath4 , but more significant differences appear for properties associated with clustering and network correlations .",
    "minimum , and the the solid lines are the average values for a given @xmath8 . for comparison ,",
    "the function @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the randomized networks and an erds - renyi ( er ) random graph have also been plotted .",
    ", width=325 ]      the extremely heterogeneous nature of our networks is reflected in their scale - free degree distribution . to probe this heterogeneity further ,",
    "it is also helpful to look at how properties vary from node to node , and particularly how they depend on the degree of a node .",
    "we will do this for our largest network , lj@xmath2 , but results for smaller networks are similar . because of the large size of this network , there is often considerable scatter in the data . to make the trends more clear , averages of the properties , e.g.  over nodes with the same degree ,",
    "are also usually presented .",
    "the dependence of the local clustering coefficient on degree is shown in figure [ fig : c_i ] .",
    "like many other networks their is a clear association between higher degree and lower clustering.@xcite this property has often been attributed to a hierarchical structuring of the network.@xcite notably many of the deterministic scale - free networks,@xcite including the apollonian network mentioned in section [ subsect : degree],@xcite follow the power law @xmath11 . at large @xmath8",
    "the lj@xmath2 network roughly follows this law , but at low @xmath8 the @xmath12 values do not increase as fast as expected by this law .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath13 for the randomized networks has a similar type of the dependence on @xmath8 , as for the lj clusters .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since for a random uncorrelated graph in which multiple edges and self - connections are allowed , the local clustering coefficient is independent of degree , no matter what the degree distribution.@xcite the behaviour of @xmath14 is due to the correlations induced by the absence of multiple edges and self - connections@xcite and is something we will return to in the next section .    at small @xmath8 the local clustering coefficient for the isn is roughly 50100% larger than for the randomized networks .",
    "this extra local structuring most likely reflects the spatial embedding of our networks .",
    "low degree nodes have small basins of attraction , and so are only connected to basins that are close in configuration space .",
    "this spatial localization of the connections leads to high clustering .",
    "by contrast , the large degree nodes have large basins of attraction , and so the minima surrounding them can be distant in configuration space , and are not especially likely to also be connected to each other . indeed , the clustering coefficient for the global minimum is similar to the value expected for an erds - renyi random graph .",
    "minimum is represented by a data point and the solid line is the average value for a given @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath15 is the average separation between the global minimum and the rest of the nodes.,width=325 ]    in figure [ fig : d_i ] we show @xmath16 , the average separation of a node @xmath17 from the rest of the network .",
    "it is clear that the global minimum plays a central role in the network .",
    "it is the node that is on average closest to all the other nodes in the network .",
    "similarly , for all our networks the global minimum is one of the nodes for which all other nodes are within the radius of the network ( table [ table : lj ] ) .",
    "by contrast , low degree nodes are more on the periphery of the network .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_i ] that the minima separate themselves into sets depending on how far they are away from the global minimum . for those that are directly connected to the global minimum , @xmath18 is an upper bound to @xmath16 and @xmath16 would take that value if all the shortest paths involving that node passed through the global minimum .",
    "similarly , the upper bound for those two steps away from the global minimum is @xmath19 , and so on .",
    "in fact there are only a few minima that are three steps away from the lj@xmath2 global minimum .    .",
    "each data point represents ( a ) a minimum or ( b ) an edge , and the solid line the average value for a given ( a ) @xmath8 or ( b ) range of @xmath20.,width=325 ]    the vertex betweenness measures the fraction of the shortest paths between all nodes in the network that pass through a particular vertex .",
    "similarly the edge betweenness measures the fraction of these paths that pass along a particular edge in the network .",
    "these quantities provide a measure of the importance of a node or edge to a network , particularly for dynamical processes that occur on the network , such as the passage of information . for scale - free networks",
    ", there is typically a strong correlation between the vertex betweenness and the degree,@xcite and figure [ fig : b_i](a ) shows that the inherent structure networks show a similar behaviour .",
    "the vertex betweenness has roughly a power - law dependence on @xmath8 , and so given the scale - free degree distribution , this also implies that the probability distribution for the betweenness also has a power - law tail.@xcite again the global minimum plays a central role in the network . for lj@xmath2 59.8% of the shortest paths pass through this node .    for scale - free networks ,",
    "there is also usually a correlation between the edge - betweenness and some measure of the degrees at either end of the edge , but it is much weaker than for the vertex betweenness.@xcite in figure [ fig : b_i](b ) we see such a correlation with the product of the degrees at either end of the edges for the lj@xmath2 network .",
    "however , the correlation is fairly weak and there is much more scatter in the data .",
    "the edge with maximum betweenness connects the two highest - degree nodes and 0.22% of the shortest paths pass along it .      to further understand the structure of our networks , it is important to go beyond just local properties of a node to study the correlations between the properties of the nodes .",
    "indeed correlations can have an important influence on other network properties,@xcite and have a strong effect on dynamical processes that occur on a network.@xcite     minimum is represented by a data point and the solid line labelled ` lj ' is the average value for a given @xmath8 . also included is @xmath21 for the randomized networks , a line with the exponent expected for an apollonian network,@xcite and a line at @xmath22 , the value expected for an uncorrelated network.,width=325 ]    most commonly , correlations with respect to degree are investigated .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : knn ] we show",
    "how @xmath23 , the average degree of the neighbours a node , depends on the degree of the node .",
    "if the network were uncorrelated , one would expect @xmath23 to be independent of degree and to take a value @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath21 has a negative slope showing that our networks are disassortative by degree , i.e.  high degrees are more likely to be connected to low degree nodes than expected , and _",
    "vice versa_. conversely , in assortative networks nodes are more likely to be connected to those with similar degrees .",
    "interestingly , @xmath21 has an approximate power - law dependence on @xmath8 , as seen for other scale - free networks,@xcite with an exponent that is very similar to that of an apollonian network.@xcite    another way to measure such correlations is through the assortativity coefficient introduced by newman.@xcite it is a two - point correlation function of the properties at either end of an edge and is usually normalized by the value expected for a perfectly assortative network .",
    "it is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the property of interest at either end of an edge , @xmath28 denotes that the averages are over all edges and _ assort _ that the average is for a perfectly assortative network .",
    "a positive value is expected for an assortative network ( with an upper bound of 1 ) , zero for an uncorrelated network and a negative value for a disassortative network .",
    "negative values have been found for technological networks , such as the internet and world - wide web , and biochemical networks , such as the network of protein - protein interactions and metabolic networks , whereas strongly positive values have been found for social networks.@xcite values of @xmath29 are given in table [ table : lj ] and , as with @xmath21 indicate the disassortative nature of our networks .",
    "the values found for the larger clusters are quite similar to those for technological networks.@xcite    the origin of this disassortativity has been explored in most depth for the internet.@xcite in particular , it was found that the exclusion of multiple edges and self - connections can be a significant source of disassortativity . indeed , when we compare @xmath23 and @xmath29 to the values for the randomized networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : knn ] and table [ table : random ] ) , we find very similar levels of disassortativity .    in an uncorrelated network ,",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen edge will connect two particular nodes is @xmath30 and , hence , the total number of expected connections between the two nodes is @xmath31 . for the lj@xmath2 network this gives an expected value of 33.5 edges between the two highest degree nodes .",
    "as only one is possible , the network appears disassortative .    correlations also have a significant effect on the clustering.@xcite as indicated by the expressions above , the probability that the neighbours of a node are connected depends sensitively on the degrees of the neighbours , with high degree nodes being much more likely to be connected .",
    "hence the local clustering coefficient is higher for nodes with larger @xmath23 , and so even for the randomized graphs the local clustering coefficient decreases as @xmath8 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c_i ] ) .",
    "minimum , and the lines binned averages for both the lj@xmath2 network , and randomized versions , as labelled.,width=325 ]    we have also explored correlations between the potential energies of connected minima .",
    "values of @xmath32 are given for both the inherent structure networks and the randomized versions in tables [ table : lj ] and [ table : random ] , respectively , and the behaviour of @xmath33 , the average energy of the the minima to which a minimum is directly connected , is shown in figure [ fig : enn ] . because of the correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lj14_ke ] ) , one might also expect the networks to be disassortative with respect to the energy of the minima .",
    "however , for @xmath35 positive values of @xmath32 are found , whereas the values for the randomized networks are always negative , and of roughly similar magnitude to @xmath36 .",
    "this difference shows that the potential energy of the minima plays an important role in the structure of the network .    at low energies",
    ", @xmath37 has a gentle negative slope similar to that for the randomized graphs , and probably mainly reflects the exclusion of self - connections and multiple edges .",
    "the low - enegy hubs have to be connected to higher - energy minima because of the constraint that all the neighbours must be different .",
    "for example , the lj@xmath2 global minimum is connected to 3201 of the 4196 nodes .",
    "even if these were the 3201 lowest - energy nodes ( i.e.  maximally assortative given the exclusion of multiple edges ) , the average energy of its neighbours would only be a little lower ( @xmath38 ) than the actual value .",
    "however , for the higher - energy nodes @xmath37 has a strongly positive slope , because of the preference for linking to minima with similar energy .",
    "although uncorrelated energy landscapes have been studied theoretically,@xcite the assumption that the energy of connected states is independent is usually unrealistic and gives rise to landscapes that are extremely rough .",
    "( indeed the first step in incorporating greater realism in these models is often to include correlations.@xcite ) for landscapes associated with the configurations of atomic systems , the landscapes are much smoother , simply because connected states are likely to be structurally similar and hence have similar energies .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the measures of correlations we have used here are quite local , and apply to just the immediate neighbourhood of a basin . when energy landscapes are inferred to be rough , e.g.",
    "because the system is a good glass - former and easily gets stuck in traps on the landscape,@xcite this is usually referring to a lack of correlations at larger length scales .",
    "so far , we have made a detailed characterization of the network of connections between the minima on a potential energy surface , and these results provide important insights into the fundamental organization of energy landscapes .",
    "but it is also important to understand the implications of this topology for the dynamics of a system .    clearly , the small - world nature of the inherent structure networks has important consequences for the theoretical understanding of searching configuration space .",
    "for example , the levinthal paradox in protein folding highlights the huge number of possible configurations of a protein and the seeming impossibility of reaching the native state in a random search through these configurations , in contrast to the protein s actual ability to fold.@xcite similar paradoxes can of course be formulated for any system with a large configuration space , be it a macromolecule , cluster or bulk liquid , that is able to routinely find a preferred structure .",
    "more formally , the exponential increase in the size of the search space underlies the classification of most problems involving the global optimization of a configuration as `` np - hard'';@xcite i.e.  there is no known algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the problem in polynomial time .",
    "our results offer part of the answer to these paradoxes . even for high - dimensional configuration spaces with huge numbers of accessible states ,",
    "the number of steps in a pathway from a random configuration to the target state remains modest due to the favourable scaling with size ( eq .  ( [ eq : lave_land ] ) ) .",
    "of course , finding that particular pathway in the absence of additional guiding information can be extremely hard , although there is some evidence that a local knowledge of the topology can be of some help.@xcite indeed , the emphasis of most proposed solutions to the levinthal paradox is on those features of the energy landscape , such as funnels,@xcite that guide the system in the right direction in its descent down the energy landscape , and whose presence differentiates those systems that are able to find the target state , from those that get stuck in the morass of possible configurations .",
    "the dramatic consequences of this small - world behaviour are evidenced in examples where the energy landscape has a favourable topography .",
    "for example , for lj@xmath39 it has been estimated that there are @xmath40 minima . however , the basin - hopping global optimization algorithm is able to find the global minimum from a random starting point after sampling on average only approximately 150 minima.@xcite    the scale - free nature of the inherent structure network will also have important implications for a system s dynamics .",
    "interestingly , at the centre of leopold _",
    "et al _ s original definition of a folding funnel was the concept of a `` convergence of multiple pathways '' at the native state of a protein.@xcite interpreting this idea in network terms , it seems to be suggesting that the native state would be a hub in the network . for our inherent structure networks we see such convergence with the global minimum connected to a significant fraction of the other minima , and similar results",
    "have been obtained in rao _",
    "s investigation of the connectivity of configuration space for polypeptide chains.@xcite of course , there is also a strong topographical component inherent in the idea of a funnel , namely that as the system goes downhill it is becoming closer to the native state , and it is this feature that has received the most emphasis more recently , perhaps to the neglect of the potential focussing aspects of the topology .",
    "a wide variety of dynamical processes have been studied on complex networks .",
    "the dynamics of interest here is the molecular dynamics on the potential energy surface , as dictated by the forces on the system .",
    "the most relevant work to this from the networks literature is that examining diffusion on scale - free networks,@xcite where it was found that this topology led to more favourable scaling of the transit time between nodes , particularly when these nodes had high - degree .",
    "the effect of the topology on the dynamics on an energy landscape can be illustrated for a simple model landscape where topographical features are eliminated .",
    "the model consists of a a flat landscape where all the minima are identical , except for their connectivity , i.e.  they have the same energies and vibrational ( and hence thermodynamical ) properties , and furthermore , all the transition rates between connected minima take the same value @xmath41 .",
    "the average residence time in a minimum @xmath17 is then @xmath42 .",
    "as the equilibrium probability of being in a minimum @xmath17 is simply @xmath43 , the frequency with which this minimum is visited is @xmath44 .",
    "the first passage time for encountering a minimum therefore decreases with degree .",
    "the topology of the inherent structure network has a focussing effect directing the system more rapidly to the highly - connected hubs .",
    "the effects of the topology on the dynamics will be explored in more detail in future work .",
    "in this paper we have provided a detailed characterization of the inherent structure networks for a series of small lennard - jones clusters .",
    "these networks show the mixture of local order ( as measured by clustering coefficients ) and small average separations between nodes that is characteristic of small - world networks.@xcite furthermore as the size of the clusters increase , these inherent structure networks develop a clear power - law tail to the degree distribution and have a whole variety of properties that are typical of scale - free networks",
    ".    however , in contrast to most scale - free networks the origin of this scale - free topology is not due to some form of preferential attachment during network growth.@xcite instead , the network heterogeneity reflects the topography of the energy landscape with the degree of a node strongly correlated to the potential energy of the associated minimum .",
    "this correlation most likely arises because the low - energy minima have larger basins of attraction , and so are likely to have more transition states located on their basin boundaries .",
    "apollonian networks provide a model of how such basins could be organized to give rise to a scale - free network . hence , the discovery of the scale - free character of inherent structure networks may have profound implications for our understanding of the way the inherent structure mapping divides up configuration space , and raises the possibility that configuration space is tiled by a fractal , apollonian - like packing of basins .",
    "the results presented here for the inherent structure networks are for systems interacting with a particular potential and of small size , so it is natural to ask how general are the results .",
    "firstly , we see no obvious reason why the lennard - jones potential should be `` special '' , producing scale - free networks , while the landscapes associated with other potentials have different topologies . however , it is conceivable that differences might arise as a result of the orientational degrees of freedom associated with molecular ( not atomic ) systems or the constraints of chain connectivity associated with polymers , and we intend to explore this further in future work .",
    "the work of rao and caflisch is also of interest in this regard , because the networks they constructed to represent the configuration space connectivity of polypeptides also showed scale - free behaviour.@xcite    secondly , because of the exponential increase in the number of minima and transition states with system size , the analysis we presented here is inevitably limited to relatively small sizes .",
    "furthermore , there is currently no known method to construct a statistical representation of the inherent structure network from an incomplete sampling of the network .",
    "one potential way to analyse systems of larger size is to use a more coarse - grained division of configuration space than provided by the inherent structure mapping , such as that used by rao and caflisch.@xcite another more indirect approach would be to probe properties that sensitively reflect the underlying network topology .",
    "for example , the analogy to apollonian networks suggests that the distribution of basin areas should follow a power law with an exponent approximately equal to -2.@xcite"
