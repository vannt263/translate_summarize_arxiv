    "although the actual site of the astrophysical r - process is still not known with certainty , it is commonly accepted that occurs in an explosive environment of relatively high temperatures ( @xmath6 k ) and very high neutron densities ( @xmath7 @xmath8 )  @xcite . under such conditions ,",
    "neutron captures are much faster than competing beta decays and the r - process path in the nuclear chart proceeds through a chain of extremely neutron rich nuclei with relatively low and approximately constant neutron separation energies ( @xmath9  mev ) . due to the relatively stronger binding of nuclei with magic neutron numbers , the neutron separation energies show discontinuities at the magic numbers @xmath0 , 82 , and 126 .",
    "as a consequence the r - process matter flow slows down when it reaches these neutron - magic nuclei and has to wait for several beta decays ( which are also longer than for other nuclei on the r - process path ) to occur until further neutron captures are possible carrying the mass flow to heavier nuclei .",
    "thus matter is accumulated at these r - process waiting points associated with the neutron numbers @xmath0 , 82 , and 126 leading to the well - known peaks in the observed r - process abundance distribution .",
    "the beta half - lives of the waiting points have at least two important effects on the r - process dynamics and abundance distributions . at first",
    ", they mainly determine the time it takes the mass flow within the r - process to transmute seed nuclei to heavy nuclei in the third peak around @xmath10 .",
    "second , in the astrophysical environment the nuclear r - process timescale ( given by the sum of beta half - lives of nuclei in the r - process path ) competes with some dynamical timescale of the environment , e.g. the expansion timescale of the ejected matter .",
    "if the r - process path and half - lives were known , the reproduction of the abundance distribution can be used to constrain the conditions of the astrophysical environment .",
    "if the r - process has sufficient time for beta - flow equilibrium to establish , the relative elemental abundances are proportional to the beta half - life  @xcite .    despite their importance",
    "only a few half - lives of waiting points with magic neutron numbers @xmath0 and 82 are known experimentally  @xcite , while no experimental data exist yet for the @xmath5 waiting points .",
    "the situation is expected to improve in the near future with the advent of new experimental facilities .",
    "for example , the beta - decay half - lives of 38 new neutron - rich isotopes from kr to tc close to the r - process path have been measured at the new ribf facility at riken  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , researchers at gsi have measured half - lives of nuclei close to @xmath5 using a novel analysis method  @xcite . despite this progress , the half - lives needed for r - process simulations have mainly to rely on theoretical estimates .",
    "as the q - values involved are rather low , such calculations have traditionally been based on allowed , i.e. gamow - teller , transitions .",
    "most of these studies used the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) either on top of semi - empirical global models @xcite or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method @xcite .",
    "although the calculations give a fair account of the few experimental half - lives , it is well known that these models underestimate the correlations among nucleons which pull down the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength to low energies .",
    "this shortcoming is overcome within the interacting shell model which indeed describes the measured half - lives of r - process waiting point nuclei very well @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the appearance of intruder single particle states with different parity may have influence on the low - energy spectra of the r - process waiting point nuclei .",
    "thus it is conceivable that first - forbidden transitions might contribute to the half - lives of these nuclei . a first attempt to estimate such forbidden contributions has been taken within the gross theory  @xcite",
    "this model , however , has been found as rather inaccurate when applied to gamow - teller transitions .",
    "more recently , borzov extended the qrpa studies based on the fayans energy functional to a consistent treatment of allowed and first - forbidden contributions to r - process half - lives  @xcite .",
    "while these calculations find that forbidden contributions give only a small correction to the half - lives of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 waiting point nuclei , they result in a significant reduction of the @xmath5 half - lives .",
    "this important finding has been our motivation to extend our shell model calculations of waiting point half - lives to include also first - forbidden transitions .",
    "we expect that correlations among nucleons will not only affect the half - lives , but a reliable description of the detailed allowed and forbidden strength function is needed to estimate the probabilities for beta - delayed neutron emission rates which are known to be important to describe the decay of the r - process nuclei towards stability after freeze - out .",
    "we note that gt and higher multipole transitions are relevant to describe neutrino - nucleus reactions which are important in many astrophysical sites  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , these reactions have been studied within the random phase approximation  @xcite , including nuclei relevant to r - process nucleosynthesis  . in an interesting recent development",
    ", neutrino - induced reactions on light nuclei with relevance to neutrino - nucleosynthesis  @xcite have been calculated on the basis of the shell - model , including gt and first - forbidden transitions  @xcite .",
    "in our half - life calculations , we consider allowed and first - forbidden contributions .",
    "these are obtained using the diagonalization shell mode code nathan developed by etienne caurier @xcite to calculate the initial and final nuclear states and the corresponding nuclear transition matrix elements .",
    "model spaces and residual interactions will be discussed for the three different sets of waiting point nuclei with @xmath12 and 126 individually .",
    "the partial half - life , @xmath13 , for a transition between an initial ( normally the ground state ) and a final nuclear state is related to the phase space factor by : @xmath14 the phase factor has the form : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the so called shape factor that depends on the electron energy , @xmath17 in units of the electron mass .",

    "we note that for all nuclei studied here first - forbidden transitions are mainly mediated by rank 0 and 1 operators ( the latter contributes about @xmath103 to the forbidden strength ) , while the contribution arising from rank 2 operators are very small .",
    "due to its larger sensitivity to phase space ( @xmath104 ) the relative contribution of rank 2 transitions increases slightly with decreasing charge number .",
    "for the @xmath5 nuclei studied here , the depopulation of the @xmath72 proton orbital with decreasing charge number , which increases both the gamow - teller and first - forbidden transitions , dominates the trend observed in our half - lives .",
    "changes in phase space and pairing have lesser effects on our half - life systematics .    .",
    "]    gamow - teller transitions proceed to final states mainly above the neutron threshold and hence are accompanied by neutron emission , while the final states populated by first - forbidden transition predominantly reside below the neutron threshold .",

    "the striking odd - even staggering is related to pairing which reduces the neutron threshold energies in odd - odd daughter nuclei relatively to odd-@xmath106 nuclei , but does basically not affect the strength distributions , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the qrpa / frdm neutron emission probabilities show a rather abrupt increase at @xmath107 which is likely due to the fact that qrpa calculations show significantly less fragmentation of the strength than shell model studies and that , for @xmath108 , the few dominant transitions reside above the neutron threshold .",
