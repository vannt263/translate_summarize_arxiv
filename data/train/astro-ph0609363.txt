    "tidal tails , resulting from the interactions of galaxies , can create self - gravitating structures which are the seeds of dwarf galaxies . in these galaxies ,",
    "commonly known as _ tidal dwarf galaxies _ ( tdgs ) , the dark matter ( dm ) content is very small , which make them more vulnerable to stellar feedback .",
    "1-d dm - free models of dwarf galaxies have already demonstrated that they can remain bound even with a large fraction of supernova - expelled gas ( hensler et al .",
    "we perform 2-d chemodynamical simulations of dm - poor dwarf galaxies in order to study the impact of feedback from the ongoing star formation ( sf ) to such structures characterized by a low binding energy ( kroupa @xcite ) .",
    "sf depends on the density and temperature of the gas .",
    "self - gravity and a treatment of the chemical evolution of the stellar and gaseous component are considered .",
    "we present here models with an initial total gas mass of 4 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 and we have modified further parameters as sf efficiency @xmath3 , temperature threshold t@xmath4 for sf , initial mass distribution ( spherical vs. aspherical ) , and gas infall ( no , subsonic , supersonic ) .",
    "in a model with @xmath5 , t@xmath4 = 10@xmath6 k , type ii supernovae produce a large - scale galactic wind able to unbind most of the gas after @xmath7 100 myr and sf can not proceed further . if we reduce t@xmath4 to 10@xmath8 k , a smaller amount of gas fulfills the conditions for the sf , therefore the galaxy does not experience a burst but a continuous episode of sf of mild intensity lasting several hundreds of myr . also a reduction of @xmath3 to 0.1 leads to a sf rate milder compared to the standard model and no disruptive bursts occur within the first 100 myr .",
    "an aspherical initial gas distribution favors the development of a large - scale outflow in the polar direction .",
    "however , the transport of material along the r - axis is not significant and stars still can form inside the cavity walls ( see fig .",
    "models with gas infall reveal that in case of a supersonic infall a shock wave propagates towards the galaxy center and triggers a very powerful disruptive central starburst .",
    "a subsonic infall provides instead a continuous reservoir of gas for the sf and does not trigger starbursts .",
    "also in this case , the sf lasts several hundreds of myr .",
    "from our models we found that tdgs are not necessarily destroyed rapidly and can sustain sf for times longer than 200 myr and that galactic winds do not always suppress sf .",
    "further work is necessary to sharpen our understanding of these issues ."
