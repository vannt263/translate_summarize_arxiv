    "we develop techniques for the identification of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei based on their variability . this effort is a direct extension of the survey for variability in images with stellar structure by trevese ( 1994 ; t94 ) . here , we consider images that are detected to be extended , which would be expected to correspond to seyfert 1 galaxies .    in a series of papers ( kron & chiu 1981 , koo , kron , & cudworth 1986 [ kkc ] , koo & kron 1988 [ kk88 ] , trevese 1989 [ t89 ] , majewski 1991 , and trevese 1994 [ t94 ] ) , we have elaborated a number of search techniques for quasars in selected area 57 to faint limits ( @xmath12 ) , including colors , lack of proper motion , and variability .",
    "these various techniques yield somewhat different samples , which then serve to calibrate the incompleteness of any single technique .",
    "however , all of these studies have relied on a parent sample that is restricted to images with structures consistent with star images .",
    "one of our results is that the sample of apparently faint quasars is rich in objects that are absolutely faint : according to t94 , the sample of 35 quasars has a median luminosity of m@xmath13 = -23.9 ( h@xmath14 = 50 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , q@xmath14 = 0.5 , @xmath15 = -1 ) , and three quasars have luminosities fainter than m@xmath13 = -22.0 .",
    "five have redshifts smaller than 0.8 . traditionally seyfert",
    "1 galaxies and quasars are separated at m@xmath13 = -23 ( a distinction we have previously ignored by calling all of the objects in our lists with stellar images and broad lines `` quasars '' ) .",
    "clearly there is a likelihood that we have missed some active nuclei in @xmath16 57 because we have only searched for objects that have stellar image structure .",
    "the point of the present investigation is to address this issue , with the goal of extending the completeness of our survey to still fainter absolute magnitudes .",
    "another result of t94 was that essentially all of the known quasars were detected to be variable , and moreover we argued that the characteristic fractional variability amplitude was generally somewhat higher for active nuclei of lower luminosity .",
    "these findings suggest that seyfert galaxies could be discovered by the property of being variable .",
    "variability is well known to be a common property of seyfert 1 galaxies , but samples of seyfert galaxies have been constructed using some other defining criterion , such as spectroscopic characteristics ( cheng 1985 ; huchra & burg 1992 ) or x - ray flux ( maccacaro 1991 ) .",
    "hawkins ( 1983 ) has consistently advocated the utility of variability as a technique for discovery of quasars .",
    "his study , like the present one , was not restricted to images with stellar structure , and he , too , detected some extended images to be variable .    aside from enhancing the completeness of our catalogue of active nuclei in @xmath16 57 , there are some more specific motivations to investigate the space density of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the evolution of low - luminosity active nuclei might be very strong at low redshifts , meaning from roughly z = 0.2 to z = 0.4 , as indicated in the luminosity function at m@xmath13 @xmath10 -23.0 summarized by hartwick and schade ( 1990 ) . at face value , the density of such objects increases from @xmath17 to 0.4 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "however , the sample defining the z @xmath18 0.2 luminosity function and the sample defining the z @xmath19 0.4 luminosity function were constructed in different ways , and a wide variety of observational biases can be imagined .",
    "a single survey that spanned this range of redshifts would be a valuable check .",
    "for example , since active nuclei can often be detected in the x - ray band , one can investigate the evolution of an optically identified sample defined by x - ray flux .",
    "it happens that the einstein observatory extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) sample of active nuclei ( della ceca 1994 ) spans the same redshift range and optical luminosity range addressed here , namely 0.1 @xmath18 z @xmath18 1.0 and -21 @xmath18 m@xmath13 @xmath18 -25 , approximately .",
    "for this sample , there is little if any evolution in the x - ray luminosity function , comparing a subsample with z @xmath18 0.3 with a subsample with 0.3 @xmath18 z @xmath18 0.8 ( della ceca 1994 ) .    in order to be sure that the result for active nuclei detected in x - rays can be generalized to optically selected active nuclei , we need to know what fraction of the optically selected active nuclei are x - ray sources . shanks ( 1991 ) studied a field imaged by rosat to a limit in x - ray flux ten times fainter than that of the emss , which yielded quasars with a median redshift of 1.5 , essentially identical to that of the quasars in t89/t94 ;",
    "even the shape of the distribution at low redshifts is similar .",
    "they found that of the known quasars in the field ( selected to have z @xmath18 2.2 ) , 75% of them brighter than @xmath20 were detected by rosat . because of this high fraction",
    ", we would not expect that there will be a large number of undiscovered seyfert 1 galaxies in our field , since otherwise shanks ( 1991 ) would have detected an excess of low - redshift sources in their field .",
    "the ability to detect a variable nucleus in a host galaxy depends on a variety of factors , some of which relate to intrinsic properties of the nucleus and host , and some of which relate to observational aspects such the effects of image blur by seeing and the influence of redshift on surface brightness detection thresholds . at a fixed redshift ,",
    "if the nucleus is too luminous , the source will not qualify as a seyfert 1 galaxy , and if the nucleus is too faint , it will not be detected to be variable .",
    "even for a fixed ratio of nuclear to host - galaxy light , the detectability of variability will depend on the profile type of the host galaxy : if the light from the host galaxy is relatively extended , it will be easier to isolate the light from the nucleus .",
    "yet another complication is color effects , since the non - thermal nucleus will be bluer than the surrounding star light , and the contrast in a fixed observer s band will depend on redshift .",
    "( clearly , those nuclei discovered in an optical survey are those that do not suffer large extinction due to dust internal to the host galaxy . )    in this study we devise an operational approach for detecting variability in a sample of extended objects , meaning that there is no special attempt to counteract the selection effects mentioned above .",
    "rather , we develop an empirical procedure that yields light curves for extended objects based essentially on considerations of the signal - to - noise ratio in a single band ( the photographic @xmath21 , or@xmath22 band , where @xmath23 ) . in so doing",
    ", we can at least put lower limits on the space density of low- luminosity active nuclei at intermediate redshifts in a flux regime not previously explored .",
    "the procedure may find other things , such as galaxies that appear to be variable because of a projected quasar , variable star , or supernova .",
    "projected quasars would tend to have redshifts much higher than plausible for normal host galaxies ( and in any case we are interested in finding them ) . according to t94 , variable stars selected in this field at these magnitudes are frequently red ; hence a projected star could be recognized by a measured color uncharacteristic of a seyfert galaxy .",
    "the variable stars in @xmath16 57 also tend to have amplitudes generally lower than the quasars , and when diluted with light from the galaxy image onto which a star was projected , the amplitude would be lower still . in our survey , candidate supernovae would appear only at one epoch , but , as we discuss below , our variability measurement and selection algorithms are biased against finding such events .",
    "the data and basic procedures are described in detail in t89 and t94 . in t89",
    "we considered a catalogue of sources based on plate mpf 1053 , which serves as a fiducial epoch against which other plates are referenced .",
    "measurements were obtained on 9 plates over a baseline of 11 years .",
    "the plates are homogeneous : all are iiia - j plates obtained at the prime focus of the mayall 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory . in t89 , we established a sample of sources that were 1 ) nominally stellar and 2 ) matched with the photometric catalogue of koo ( 1986 ) .",
    "the latter condition ensures that each source has multi - band ( @xmath24 ) photometry . after applying a further condition that the sources should have a core magnitude ( called m@xmath25 ) brighter than 24.0 ( which yields total magnitudes for stellar sources brighter than about 22.5 ) , the sample analyzed there amounted to 694 sources . in this study , we consider instead a sample that is complementary : it is also matched with the koo ( 1986 ) catalogue , but includes none of the 694 sources studied in t89 and t94 .",
    "the photometry consists of aperture magnitudes called m@xmath25 , m@xmath26 , m@xmath27 , and m@xmath28 , according to the size of the aperture .",
    "m@xmath25 is the core aperture ( central 9 pixels , 0.279 arcsec per pixel ) , and m@xmath28 corresponds to an aperture with a radius of 1.1 arcsec .",
    "the index m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 measures the image concentration .",
    "since the sources have various degrees of angular extent , the magnitude cut is a sliding function of apparent size in order that the limiting signal - to - noise ratio be approximately constant . specifically , for m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 @xmath18 0.95 , the magnitude cut is m@xmath26 @xmath18 23.5 , and for m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 @xmath19 0.95 , the magnitude cut is m@xmath26 @xmath18 23.5 + 2.5 [ ( m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 ) - 0.95 ] . for",
    "a variety of reasons , our techniques measure bright objects poorly , and we have accordingly further eliminated all objects with m@xmath28 @xmath18 20 .",
    "this resulting sample consists of 1636 objects in 1022 square arc minutes .",
    "- m@xmath27 or large variability . visual inspection of the brightest of these sources on plate prints revealed they were plate flaws .",
    "unmatched sources were excluded from the final list of variable candidates . ]",
    "the aperture that gives the most robust measure of the magnitude is a function of both image shape and magnitude , for example m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 and m@xmath28 .",
    "we estimated the values of these so - called optimum apertures empirically by examining the scatter in independent measures of magnitude as a function of aperture size , for samples defined in different bins of magnitude and image concentration .",
    "one would expect different plates to have different optimum apertures for the same object , but we found that this extra complication was not warranted : each object is measured with the same aperture on all plates .",
    "one difference with respect to the analysis of t89/t94 is that the normalization of the plate - to - plate differences of optimum magnitudes ( @xmath29 m ) is done by fitting a plane to the differences in the space of m@xmath28 and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 , instead of fitting line segments to the differences versus m@xmath28 .",
    "table 1 gives specific values for the adopted apertures .",
    "after averaging measures at a common epoch and after weighting the plates by their quality , we derive a measure of variability called @xmath30 * for each source . this is essentially the r.m.s .",
    "value , after a variety of scale corrections have been applied to ensure that the magnitude system on average matches that of plate mpf 1053 ( see t89 and t94 for details ) .    to provide a statistically consistent variability threshold",
    ", we constructed a normalized quantity @xmath31 where the mean and standard deviation of @xmath30 * [ @xmath32 and @xmath33 * ) , respectively ] are measured as a function of m@xmath28 and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 .",
    "the bivariate distribution of @xmath30 * in m@xmath28 and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 varies little as a function of m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 at a given m@xmath28 except at the threshold between stellar and non - stellar objects ( m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 = 1.05 ) .",
    "hence , we simply divided the sample into two bins of m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 ( @xmath18 1.05 and @xmath341.05 ) , and found @xmath32 and @xmath33 * ) independently for these two samples . to find the mean @xmath30 * , @xmath32 , as a function of m@xmath28",
    ", we fit a low - order spline function and rejected individual points from the fit if they were more than 3 standard deviations above or below the best fit .",
    "this rejection process was iterated three times . the standard deviation about this fit , @xmath33 * ) ,",
    "was then redetermined more precisely using a sliding window in m@xmath28 about each object , adjusted to be wide enough to include a minimum of 100 objects , up to a maximum width of 0.5 mag .",
    "again , objects above 3 standard deviations from the original fitting process were excluded from the calculation . to ensure that the standard deviation changed smoothly with m@xmath28",
    ", we fit a low - order spline to the individual standard deviation measurements as a function of m@xmath28 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the values of the mean and standard deviation of @xmath30 * as a function of m@xmath28 and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 that we used in this analysis to construct @xmath30*@xmath35 .",
    "we note that while the present sample of sources is supposed to have extended image structure , it most likely contains some bona fide stars , especially at the faint end .",
    "for example , an object with m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 @xmath18 1.05 but with m@xmath25 @xmath19 24.0 would not be included in the source list of t89 , but it will appear in the complementary list considered here .",
    "a few such objects will have measured m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 , bright enough to be reliably measured for variability .",
    "the criterion for variability that we adopt is simple : for m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 , the normalized @xmath30 * , @xmath30*@xmath35 , must be larger than 2.5 . for comparison ,",
    "we consider also a secondary sample consisting of 35 sources with m@xmath28 @xmath19 22.5 and @xmath30*@xmath35 larger than 3.5 .",
    "the 14 sources in the first list can be considered to be prime candidates , and are listed in table 3 .",
    "two sources in the second list are also included in table 3 in order to define a sample complete to @xmath36 , as defined by the total magnitudes from koo ( 1986 ) .",
    "these are discussed in section 4 .",
    "all of the sources in table 3 have extended light profiles as defined both by the criterion m@xmath37m@xmath38 and by the r@xmath39 parameter of kron ( 1980 ) .",
    "we inspected the images of each of these visually to check for any peculiarities ( such as close neighbors ) that potentially might influence the photometry .",
    "no clear problems were found , but some close neighbors are indicated in the notes to table 3 .",
    "some cases of candidate variables were matched with more than one object in the koo ( 1986 ) list . upon inspection , in all cases",
    "the present catalogue misses a close object , and it is impossible to recover which particular object was actually measured .",
    "it seems very likely that the proximity of two or more objects has resulted in photometric errors that appear as large @xmath30*. we have deleted from further consideration all cases where there were multiple matches .",
    "all of the close neighbors indicated in table 3 were substantially fainter than the ones resulting in multiple matches .",
    "figure 1 shows a plot of @xmath30 * versus m@xmath28 for the sample of 1636 objects .",
    "the format of this plot is directly analogous to that of figure 1 of t89 .",
    "note that the noise level defined by the majority of non - variable objects is respectably low , and in fact compares well with that for stellar images ( i.e. figure 1 of t89 ) , despite the expected greater difficulty of measuring images with a variety of profile types .",
    "the upper envelope of @xmath30 * is quite well- defined for the non - variable objects down to about m@xmath28 = 22.5 .",
    "the candidate variable objects selected according to the criteria mentioned in the previous section are marked .",
    "( note that at faint magnitudes there is an overlap between the marked and unmarked objects .",
    "this occurs because the compact images are normalized differently from the extended images . )",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 * for the candidate variables is similar to that of the quasars discussed in t89 . in the latter case we had substantial spectroscopic confirmation that the variables really are quasars ( and therefore are likely to be truly variable ! ) . in the present case ,",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation is not as complete .",
    "spectra for 12 of the 16 candidates in table 3 have have been collected over the past decade using kpno multi - fiber spectrographs on the mayall 4 m telescope ( figure 2a ) and more recently on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope ( figure 2b ) .",
    "these spectra were obtained as part of larger redshift survey programs ( kk88 , kron 1991 , munn 1997 , bershady 1997 ) .",
    "three candidates in figure 2a clearly show evidence for the presence of agn : mgii is detected in nser 100681 and 114264 , and broad h@xmath15 emission is seen in nser 110195 . for nser 100681 ,",
    "the mgii line ( as well as h@xmath40 and [ o  iii ] @xmath41 ) have been independently confirmed from a spectrum taken with the kpno 2.1 m and goldcam spectrograph ( bershady , trevese , and kron 1991 ) . for nser 114264",
    ", the mgii identification is less secure because it is so near the blue limit of the spectral range , although it does avoid the telluric absorption feature at 3700   and it is at the correct wavelength for the redshift determined from other lines .",
    "notice also the unusual combination of a strong break at 4000   _ and _ the presence of [ o  iii ] @xmath41  emission ( h@xmath40 suffers from being on a sky line ) .",
    "the last object in figure 2a , nser 110459 , has a secure redshift but no detected line emission ; there is insufficient evidence for the presence ( or absence ) of agn . in the last two cases , increased signal - to - noise and extension of spectral coverage to the blue or red ( to cover either mgii or h@xmath15 ) would further secure identification of nuclear activity .",
    "the spectrum for one additional object ( nser 116720 ) is not shown because it has inadequate signal - to - noise to be of value .",
    "of the more recent spectroscopy shown in figure 2b , only one candidate s spectrum ( nser 105334 ) presents compelling evidence for nuclear activity based on line ratios of [ o  ii ] @xmath42 , h@xmath40 and [ o  iii ] @xmath43 .",
    "we estimate log ( [ o  iii ] @xmath43/h@xmath40 ) @xmath10 0.76 @xmath44 0.04 and log ( [ o  ii ] @xmath42/h@xmath40 @xmath10 0.41 @xmath44 0.02 , where the uncertainties include random errors only .",
    "for example , we have made no correction for h@xmath40 absorption .",
    "also , the spectrum is uncalibrated . to estimate the [ o  ii ] @xmath42/h@xmath40 ratio ,",
    "we have used nominal throughput values as a function of wavelength , calculated specifically for the adopted instrumental configuration .",
    "the estimated values are just on the border of the seyfert 2 region defined by tresse ( 1996 and references therein ) , in a region where some confirmed seyfert 2 s are found .",
    "one other object in figure 2b has a secure spectroscopic redshift : nser 108853 .",
    "while line emission is evident ( [ o  ii ] @xmath42 and possibly [ o  iii ] @xmath43 ) , the spectrum does not cover h@xmath15 or mgii .",
    "the other four objects in figure 2b also show line emission , however either there is only one line ( identified as [ o  ii ] @xmath42 for nser 113571 , [ o  iii ] @xmath43 for nser 107772 and h@xmath15 for nser 118640 ) , or the line is near a strong sky line ( nser 106596 ) . for the two cases where either mgii or h@xmath15 is supposed to be within the spectral range , the redshifts are uncertain .",
    "lastly , there is one object ( nser 104326 ) for which we have obtained two spectra , @xmath106 years apart ( figure 2d ) .",
    "both spectra were observed with identical apertures ( 3 arcsec diameter fibers ) .",
    "while the first spectrum shows only one probable emission line ( [ o  ii ] @xmath42 ) the second spectrum shows strong ( and narrow ) [ o  ii ] @xmath42 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath41 at @xmath45 .",
    "the first spectrum also has a very blue ( rising ) continuum below 5500  .",
    "while the second spectrum is not flux calibrated , it shows a strong ( balmer ) break not present in the first , and a redder continuum below 5500  ; these differences are not attributable to the lack of calibration in the more recent spectrum .",
    "this object exhibits spectral variability which we identify as seyfert - like activity .    in summary ,",
    "three objects are definitely confirmed seyfert 1 s ( nser 100681 , 110195 , 104326 ) , one object is likely a seyfert 1 ( nser 114264 ) , and a fifth ( nser 105334 ) has line ratios marginally consistent with a seyfert 2 .",
    "we identify these five as confirmed agn . of the remaining six spectroscopically observed candidates ,",
    "none can be definitively ruled out as agn on the basis of the available spectra .",
    "there are many possible reasons why an extended image might erroneously be selected as a variable , and without additional arguments , one does not know how seriously to take the remaining unconfirmed candidates .",
    "first , we can ask whether the number of candidates in table 3 is reasonable given expectations for the number of seyfert 1 galaxies to this depth .",
    "such an estimate was made by r. burg ( 1987 ) , who predicted the counts of seyfert 1 galaxies based on the statistics of active nuclei seen in the cfa survey . according to this estimate , 24 seyfert",
    "1 galaxies are expected in this area to this depth .",
    "but , our survey is sensitive only to a particular subset as outlined in section i , and on this basis the actual number of candidates seems to be broadly reasonable .",
    "moreover , as mentioned earlier , the results rosat identifications by shanks ( 1991 ) constrain the population of active nuclei at b @xmath10 21 , with similar conclusions .",
    "one possible source of contamination in our sample may be supernovae .",
    "a supernova explosion within a galaxy could sufficiently alter the galaxy s luminosity to give it a variability index that would fall above our selection threshold . in this case , however , one would expect the light curve to change ( brighten ) only at one epoch .",
    "the light curves of the candidate variables , shown in figure 3 , indicate that only two objects plausibly fit this pattern ( nser 104326 and 114264 ) .",
    "inspection of the images of these sources at the appropriate epochs show no supernova events .",
    "moreover , for both of these objects there is spectroscopic evidence for seyfert - like activity . in short",
    ", there is no compelling evidence that supernovae are significant contributors to the variability of our candidates . indeed",
    ", we would not expect to find supernovae in our sample of variables because the anticipated total number of supernovae events is small , supernovae yr@xmath6 deg@xmath11 for @xmath46 , we estimate there should be 0 to 3 supernovae in our entire series of plate images . the scaling accounts for smaller area ( 0.284 deg@xmath1 ) , shallower depth ( translating to roughly a factor of two lower galaxy surface density ) , and a sampling of the equivalent of 0.3 yr ( 7 epochs , each spaced by @xmath19 1 year , and estimating supernovae will be bright enough to raise our variability index above threshold for 15 days ) .",
    "] and our variability algorithm is not optimized for supernovae : the apertures used to measure variability enclose a small fraction of the total apparent galaxy area in a central region where the light profile is brightest ( worst contrast ) , and our glitch - suppression algorithm ( see t89 ) favors throwing out single epochs of large variability .",
    "the absence of supernovae events in our sample therefore should _ not _ be used to constrain supernovae rates in faint galaxy samples .",
    "our variability algorithm is well suited for finding on - going nuclear variability of low to moderate amplitudes .",
    "if the list of candidate variables indeed consists of mainly seyfert 1 galaxies , we would expect the distribution of m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 indices to show a tendency to small ( compact ) values , since the nucleus should affect the overall profile .",
    "figure 4 plots m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 versus m@xmath28 to explore this possibility .",
    "the five objects confirmed spectroscopically to have active nuclei indeed have smaller m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 than the parent sample , with the exception perhaps of nser 104326 . in general , the candidates at m@xmath28 @xmath18 21.7 appear to be generally compact , whereas the fainter candidates ( 21.7 @xmath18 m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 ) are not clearly distinct from the parent sample in this index .",
    "this could suggest either that the lists of candidates becomes less reliable with increasing faintness , or that the errors in m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 grow with increasing m@xmath28 ( but the reliability remains high ) , or that the fainter seyferts are , in fact , more extended . without further information , it is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "as previously mentioned , active nuclei are expected to be bluer than the host stellar population , especially in a color index like @xmath47 .",
    "we therefore check the color distribution .",
    "we have taken the @xmath48 color index from the koo ( 1986 ) catalogue , and plot it in figure 5 versus m@xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of the candidate variables in this plot with respect to the parent population follows very much the same trends as noted for figure 4 , namely : the five objects confirmed spectroscopically to have active nuclei ( including nser 104326 ) clearly fulfill the expectation of bluer @xmath48 colors .",
    "the candidates at m@xmath28 @xmath18 21.7 are somewhat bluer than the rest of the population , and the fainter one ( 21.7 @xmath18 m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 ) are typical of the population .",
    "the bivariate distribution in @xmath48 color and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 image compactness indices , illustrated in figure 6(a ) , also reveals the m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 candidates are distinct from the rest of the population . here",
    ", however , even the 21.7 @xmath18 m@xmath28 @xmath18 22.5 candidates are distinct .",
    "it appears that the color distribution for the candidate variables is more clearly distinct from the parent population than the size distribution .",
    "note in particular the absence on any candidates in the clump of points centered at roughly @xmath49 and m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 @xmath10 1.15 .",
    "this clump corresponds to normal galaxies with red colors and large bulges such as types e and sa .    a priori , it is not obvious how , or if the light curves of the variable candidates will show correlations with other observables .",
    "the light curves for the five reddest candidates ( @xmath50 ) all show large amplitude ( 0.5 mag ) changes between epochs .",
    "four of these are the faintest at the same epoch .",
    "inspection of the spatial locations of these objects , however , shows they are randomly positioned in the field .",
    "therefore this coincidence is not likely the result of a plate flaw .",
    "one of the bluest objects also is faintest at this epoch and has a comparably large amplitude change .",
    "hence there is no strong indication that the light curve amplitude and shape correlate with color .",
    "the shapes of the light curves also show no obvious trends with either m@xmath28 or m@xmath25 - m@xmath27 .",
    "finally , we can use the spectroscopic redshift information to explore whether the candidates are unusually distributed in luminosity or redshift .",
    "the hubble diagram in figure 7 compares the 14 variables candidates with spectroscopically confirmed galaxies ( munn 1997 ) and qsos ( kron 1991 ) in the same field . for candidates without spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "photometric redshifts are calculated using a method similar to that described by connolly ( 1995 ) .",
    "the five objects confirmed spectroscopically to have active nuclei span a large range in luminosity .",
    "the apparently brightest candidates , nser 100681 , is also the most luminous extended source in the field , while nser 105334 is roughly at 0.1 l@xmath51 .",
    "to refer to the normal galaxy luminosity function and corresponds to m@xmath52 for h@xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ] one other source ( nser 106596 ) is exceptionally luminous , but its spectroscopic redshift is uncertain .",
    "were it placed at its photometric redshift , its luminosity would be @xmath10l@xmath51 .",
    "nonetheless , while the bulk of the candidates appear typical in luminosity of the rest of the field galaxy population , _ the redshift distribution is skewed to higher values . _ with the exception of nser 118640 , the variable candidates are all at or _ above _ the median redshift of the field galaxy sample ( @xmath54 for @xmath0 ) .",
    "nser 118640 is itself in an unusual region of the hubble diagram .",
    "the photometric redshifts in the above analysis are in principle prone to systematics if the sources are dominated by agn light .",
    "systematics might arise because the `` training set '' used to calibrate the photometric redshift relationship contains excludes agn .",
    "in other words , the mapping of redshift onto the space of @xmath24 apparent magnitudes is done for different types of spectral energy distributions . indeed , of the five confirmed agn , the dispersion between the spectroscopic and photometric redshift is 0.18 in redshift , roughly 3.5 times larger than the average galaxy to @xmath55 using the same photometric data .",
    "on the other hand , the difference between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the same five objects is close to zero in the mean . at the very least ,",
    "photometric redshifts are useful here for identifying if the candidates have unusual colors .",
    "it appears likely , however , that photometric redshifts are reliable for these candidates on average , but unreliable for individual targets .",
    "overall we conclude that table 3 does contain many bona fide active nuclei . this impression is based on the success of spectroscopically identifying five objects ; the bivariate distribution in color and image structure ; the distribution in redshift ; and the sharp upper envelope of points in figure 1 . at minimum ,",
    "table 3 can be considered to be a good list for further spectroscopic investigation .",
    "the fainter candidates , m@xmath28 @xmath19 22.5 , likely comprise a number of truly stellar objects that were missed in our previous survey because of the way we applied selection cuts to the parent sample .",
    "indeed , over half ( 19 out of 35 ) of these variable candidates have m@xmath37m@xmath57 , and hence are consistent with stellar image profiles . of the 19 m@xmath58 candidates with m@xmath37m@xmath59 , however , about half ( nine )",
    "are classified by kron ( 1980 ) as extended .. in general r@xmath39 and m@xmath37m@xmath27 are highly correlated .",
    "different classifications based on these two indices reflect different sensitivities to a variety of image profiles , as well as noise . a comparison of r@xmath39 to m@xmath37m@xmath27 for comparably faint objects in this field can be found in koo ( 1986 ) .",
    "] yet of the 16 m@xmath60 candidates with m@xmath37m@xmath61 , only two of these are classified by kron ( 1980 ) as stellar .",
    "hence there is some indication of extended image structure for over 90% of this faint sample .    at the bright end of the m@xmath56 candidate list , one object ( nser 17671 )",
    "is independently selected as a qso candidate from kkc ( # 6 , m@xmath62 ) .",
    "this is an object classified as stellar by kron ( 1980 ) , but extended based on a value of m@xmath37m@xmath63 .",
    "nser 17671 has a tentative spectroscopic identification as a narrow emission - line galaxy at @xmath64 based on a single line identified as [ o  ii ] @xmath42 ( kk88 , table 1 , # 73 ) . the spectrum , however , does not go blue enough to detect mg ii , or red enough to detect h@xmath15 .",
    "majewski ( 1992 ) also find this object to be variable and with no detectable proper motion .    at the faint limit of the m@xmath56 candidate list ,",
    "three other objects are found in majewski s sample .",
    "two have @xmath65 .",
    "all three are stellar according to the m@xmath25-m@xmath27 criterion and kron ( 1980 ) .",
    "none pass majewski s variability threshold , while two have detectable proper motions ( one of which is very large )",
    ". however , all three objects have @xmath66 ( one is not shown in figure 6b because it is a @xmath67 band dropout ) . indeed , these are the only three objects in the faint sample with such red colors , and they are likely to be stars ( _ cf _ figure 3 of t94 ) .    figure 6(b )",
    "shows the m@xmath28 @xmath19 22.5 candidates in a plot similar to figure 6(a ) , which reveals a disproportionate number of candidates with blue @xmath48 colors and compact image structure .",
    "this is expected if the fainter sample has a higher fraction of blue stellar sources which are bona fide quasars .",
    "the remaining variable candidates , with m@xmath37m@xmath61 , are typically equally as blue as the stellar candidates . without spectroscopic confirmation",
    "the reliability of this fainter sample is unknown . in general , however , the variability amplitudes of the fainter candidates ( figure 1 ) are consistent with those of known quasars .",
    "we define @xmath22 operationally here as @xmath69 , listed in table 3 , because this magnitude is a good approximation to a total magnitude , independent of image size and shape .",
    "a sample of extended variable objects , complete to @xmath68 , can be constructed by ( i ) adding two fainter candidates ( nser 101951 and 107772 ) to our primary sampled defined by m@xmath70 ; but ( ii ) removing the faintest m@xmath70 candidate with @xmath71 ( nser 105334 , a confirmed agn ) .",
    "this complete sample is useful for assessing the surface density of agn : at these depths the spectroscopic completeness of our qso survey in @xmath16 57 is relatively high ( kron 1991 ) , and other surveys exist for comparison ( e.g. zitelli 1992 ) .",
    "the two additional extended variable candidates are only @xmath72 mag fainter than our primary sample limit in m@xmath28 , and all indications are that these two objects are good candidates .",
    "for example , both are blue ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "their light curves ( figure 3 ) are also comparable to the brighter candidates with the one exception that the 7th epoch is excluded from the estimate of @xmath30 * for nser 107772 .",
    "( this exclusion is mandated by a glitch - suppression algorithm , described in t89 . )",
    "based on m@xmath25-m@xmath27 , nser 107772 is quite compact , with @xmath48 comparable to the confirmed agn . yet while it would be considered stellar on the basis of m@xmath25-m@xmath27 , it has a large r@xmath25 and is classified as a galaxy in the catalogue of koo ( 1986 ) . in short , nser 107772 appears to be large , blue galaxy with a compact core .",
    "both objects are among the apparently largest galaxies for their apparent magnitude .    in total ,",
    "there are 15 extended variable candidates to @xmath68 , four of which are spectroscopically confirmed agn . in comparison , there are 26 confirmed qsos ( i.e. agn with stellar image structure ) in @xmath16 57 to the same limit . in addition , there are five _ stellar _ objects satisfying high variability and lack of proper motion but without spectroscopic confirmation ( t94 ) .",
    "because all other _ stellar _ objects meeting these variability and proper motion criteria are bona fide qsos , we assume here that these 5 objects are also qsos . adding our four confirmed extended variables to the 31 qsos yields a total surface density of 123 @xmath44 21 deg@xmath11 in @xmath16 57 .",
    "zitelli ( 1992 ) find a similar surface density , 115 @xmath44 16 deg@xmath11 , to the same magnitude limit , and in a separate field .",
    "their sample is 100% spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "yet in the limiting case where all of our extended variables are bona fide agn , the surface density in @xmath16 57 would reach 162 @xmath44 24 deg@xmath11 , with extended sources contributing 33% .",
    "zitelli use color and variability selection strategies for stellar sources similar to our own .",
    "there are , however , a few differences between the surveys . for example",
    ", we have proper motion information , whereas their sample includes selection by spectroscopic features seen on a grism plate .",
    "one other difference is that they do not specifically target sources with extended image structure .",
    "based on spectroscopic and photometric redshift information , the majority of our extended variable candidates have luminosities less than 10% of the nominal demarkation between qsos and agn ( m@xmath4 , h@xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , q@xmath7 ) .",
    "this luminosity estimate is an upper limit since the measured apparent magnitude is within a large aperture that includes a non - negligible contribution of light from the host galaxy .",
    "the surface density of _ confirmed _ m@xmath74 agn to @xmath9 , including 7 stellar sources and four extended sources , is 39 @xmath44 12 deg@xmath11 , again in good agreement with zitelli s value of 40 @xmath44 9 . in the limiting case where",
    "all of our extended variable candidates are bona fide agn , and we include @xmath75 of the unconfirmed , non - moving stellar variables ( 5 is the total number of unconfirmed , non - moving stellar variables ; @xmath76 is the fraction of confirmed qsos with m@xmath77 ) , the surface density would reach 82 @xmath44 17 deg@xmath11 for m@xmath8 with extended sources contributing 64% .",
    "the majority of the unconfirmed agn are between @xmath78 , whereas zitelli find no agn at @xmath79 .",
    "the total number of extended variable candidates corresponds to @xmath102% of the surface - density of all extended sources to @xmath55 .",
    "these candidates vary at roughly @xmath80 mag .",
    "in contrast , kochanski ( 1996 ) find only 0.74% of all sources vary by 0.026 mag or more to the same magnitude limit .",
    "however , t89 found @xmath109% of the stellar sources vary at roughly @xmath19 0.1 mag to @xmath81 ( or @xmath82% to @xmath55 ) .",
    "t89 s result is roughly two orders of magnitude higher than kochanski ( by kochanski s estimate ) for stellar sources .",
    "yet t89 s sample of candidate stellar variables independently identified spectroscopically confirmed qsos with high completeness and reliability .",
    "similarly , we have spectroscopically confirmed that at least one third of our extended variable candidates are bona fide agn .",
    "further , as we have discussed in section 3.2 , the number of extended variable candidates is comparable to the total number of seyfert 1 s expected at this magnitude limit .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the surface density of variable sources we find is likely reliable .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to select agn in sources with extended light profiles on the basis of variability alone , in a manner similar to that which we have successfully identified stellar agn ( qsos ) .",
    "a posteriori , several of our extended variable candidates have been confirmed spectroscopically to be bona fide agn .",
    "however , we still lack adequate spectroscopy to confirm or rule our the existence of nuclear activity for the majority of our sample .",
    "the color and size distributions of the candidates shows that at brighter magnitudes the sample is preferentially bluer and more compact than non - variable galaxies .",
    "the confirmed agn are in this magnitude range . at fainter magnitudes , the sample is more representative of the entire population of extended sources .",
    "the redshift distribution of the sample , however , is skewed to values above the median for normal galaxies at the depth of this survey . on these bases , and from our preliminary spectroscopic success , we believe we have identified a sample worthy of further spectroscopic investigation . if all of these candidates are bona fide agn , this represents a 30% increase in the surface density of all agn ( i.e. including qsos ) at @xmath9 . at the very least ,",
    "agn which appear extended in ground - based images with @xmath10 1 - 1.5 arcsec seeing represent 10% of the total agn population .",
