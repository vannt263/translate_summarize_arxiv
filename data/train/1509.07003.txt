    "the interest in designing objects whose shape can be controlled at will through the application of external stimuli is fuelling a renewed interest in questions such as whether a surface equipped with a prescribed metric can be isometrically immersed into the three - dimensional euclidean space and , more generally , which shapes will be accessible to elastic sheets through the prescription of non - euclidean metrics @xcite .",
    "besides being questions of fundamental mathematical interest @xcite , they are very relevant in biology ( shape emerging from growth and remodelling , morphogenesis ) and engineering ( bio - inspired programmable matter , soft robotics ) .",
    "a general paradigm to generate bending deformations in thin films is to induce non - constant strains through the thickness .",
    "these can in turn be triggered by spontaneous strains associated with phase transformations .",
    "an example is provided by strips of nematic elastomers in which specific textures of the director have been imprinted in the material at fabrication .",
    "the process relies on pouring a nematic liquid between two plates which have been treated to induce a given uniform alignment of the director on one of them and a different one on the other one .",
    "this induces a non - constant director profile which is then frozen in by the photo polymerization process that transform the liquid crystal into a nematic elastomer . when the isotropic - to - nematic phase transformation takes place , the spontaneous strains associated with it induce differential expansions along the film thickness , and hence curvature of its mid - surface .",
    "we refer the interested reader to , e.g. , @xcite for more details about the preparation of such samples of material .",
    "two - dimensional models for the bending deformation of thin films ( plate models ) of an active material have already been proposed in the literature .",
    "they account for bending deformations through a curvature tensor ( second fundamental form of the deformed two - dimensional configuration ) .",
    "the bending energy penalizes deviations of the curvature from a characteristic target curvature arising from spontaneous strains varying along the thickness and associated with a pre - occurred phase transition .",
    "expressions for these bending energies are typically postulated on the basis of symmetry arguments , or deduced formally from an ansatz on the displacement fields ( kirchoff - love assumption ) .    in this paper , employing rigorous dimension reduction techniques based on the theory of @xmath0-convergence , and following @xcite , we derive a ( new ) model for the bending behavior of thin films made of nematic elastomers in the regime of large deformations . starting from three - dimensional finite elasticity and considering the limit of a vanishingly small thickness , we obtain the following reduced two - dimensional energy @xmath1 whenever @xmath2 is an isometry mapping @xmath3 ( the planar domain representing the reference configuration of the mid - surface of the film ) into @xmath4 . in this expression ,",
    "the symbol @xmath5 denotes the second fundamental form associated with the deformed configuration @xmath6 and the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive constants ( material parameters related to the three - dimensional stored energy density of the material ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 symmetric matrix @xmath10 is the target curvature tensor and @xmath11 is a nonnegative constant .",
    "the characteristic quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are deduced from the three - dimensional model and given by explicit formulas , issuing from the specific variation of the spontaneous strain along the thickness .",
    "two special geometries of the director field are of particular interest , since they have been realized in practice . in the _ splay bend _ geometry ( sb ) , also called _ hybrid _ in @xcite , the explicit formulas we have obtained for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive constant , with dimension of inverse length , which quantifies the variability along the thickness of the spontaneous strain ( see and the first formula in ) .",
    "we recall that in a three - dimensional film with splay - bend geometry the director continuously rotates by @xmath14 from planar to vertical alignment ( see ) .",
    "the other geometry we consider is the _ twisted _ geometry ( t ) , see @xcite and @xcite , where instead the director ( continuously ) rotates perpendicularly to the vertical axis from a typical orientation at the bottom of the film to another typical orientation at the top of the film ( see ) . in this case , it turns out that @xmath15 the difference in the formulas for the two cases arises because of a different distribution of spontaneous strains along the thickness , cfr and .",
    "an interesting question is whether a limiting two - dimensional model energy as can be minimized at zero . if not , there will always be energy trapped in the system , indicating the presence of residual stresses . in the",
    "two reduced theories for nematic plates object of our analysis , this is always the case .",
    "more precisely , in the splay - bend geometry we have @xmath16 , while the integral term in can be minimized to zero ( by any developable surface @xmath6 whose second fundamental form @xmath5 coincides with @xmath17 ) .",
    "hence , the target curvature @xmath17 is the curvature the plate spontaneously exhibits in the absence of external loads ( spontaneous curvature ) .",
    "by contrast , in the twisted case not only @xmath18 , but also the minimum of the integral term is strictly positive .",
    "in fact , there exists no isometry @xmath2 such that @xmath19 , because in a developable surface the product of the principal curvatures must be zero at each point of the surface .",
    "this means that the target curvature is never observed in the absence of external loads .",
    "it is worth comparing the model energy with that proposed in @xcite for the study of the geometry and the mechanics arising in the opening of chiral seed pods .",
    "the difference is that in that case the class of isometries @xmath20 is not a constraint of the system and the metric @xmath21 associated with @xmath3 may be variable and is penalized when distant from the identity .",
    "going back to our analysis , we have that , interestingly , in both the splay - bend and the twisted case , an additional positive constant reveals the presence of a further source of incompatibility of the three - dimensional heterogeneous spontaneous strains , which contributes to the build - up of residual stresses in the material by preventing the limiting energy to be minimized at zero . proceeding with the comparison with @xcite",
    ", we remark that in that context a similar extra positive constant is not contemplated .",
    "to put the incompatible nematic elastomers cases in perspective , we also analyze a kinematically compatible case where the three - dimensional spontaneous strain distribution along the thickness depends quadratically on the thickness variable .",
    "we show that , as expected , this distribution leads to plates with no residual stresses and where the limiting energy corresponding attains its minimum value zero .",
    "as anticipated , we work in the framework of the dimension reduction theory which traces back to the seminal paper @xcite . in particular , to obtain our results we use the plate theory for stressed heterogeneous multilayers developed by schmidt in @xcite , which has been recently used in @xcite as a basis to propose new computational schemes .",
    "we emphasize that we use the results in @xcite as a tool to derive a new model for the bending behavior of nematic plates allowing for arbitrarily large elastic deformations . clearly , the availability of a recipe to perform the explicit computation of @xmath11 ( energy associated with residual stresses ) and @xmath10 ( target curvature , which in some cases is the curvature the system spontaneously exhibits in the absence of external loads ) in any specific case is very important from the point of view of mechanics . the major result of our analysis is to provide such general recipe , enabling us to discuss its concrete application to two specific cases representing materials that have been actually manufactured in a laboratory .",
    "a similar analysis is performed in the regime of small deformations in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present a three - dimensional model for a thin sheet of nematic elastomer with splay - bend and twisted distribution of the director along the thickness .",
    "the kinematic compatibility of the corresponding spontaneous strains is discussed in subsection [ kin_com ] , where a case of strains distributed quadratically along the thickness is analyzed as well .",
    "we consider a thin sheet of nematic elastomer occupying the reference configuration @xmath22 for some @xmath23 small , where @xmath3 is a bounded lipschitz domain of @xmath24 with sufficiently regular boundary .    throughout the paper we will denote by @xmath25 the canonical basis of @xmath4 and by @xmath26 an arbitrary point in the physical reference configuration @xmath27 . the term `` physical '' here and throughout the paper is used in contrast to the rescaled quantities we will introduce later on . also , @xmath28 is the set of the @xmath29 rotations and @xmath30 the identity matrix .",

    "suppose that the nematic director @xmath36 varies along the thickness according to a given function @xmath37 and coincides with two given constant directions at the top and at the bottom of the sheet : @xmath38 for fixed @xmath39 .",
    "the through - the - thickness variation of the nematic director translates into a corresponding variation of the spontaneous strain according to , namely @xmath40 note that in this expression we allow the material parameter @xmath41 to be @xmath42-dependent .",
    "more precisely , from now on we will assume that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a positive dimensionless parameter , while @xmath45 and @xmath42 have the physical dimension of length .",
    "this assumption is easily understandable if one thinks that curvature is related to the ratio between the magnitude of the strain difference along the thickness and the thickness itself .",
    "hence , the linear scaling in @xmath42 in is needed in order to obtain finite curvature in the limit @xmath46 .",
