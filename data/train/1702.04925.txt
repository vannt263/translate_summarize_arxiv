    "plasmons , ubiquitous collective charge density oscillations that occur in metals and semiconductors , have been studied for a long time  @xcite . in particular , plasmons in ultra - clean two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems are particularly interesting since they suffer little losses and can be tuned by the electric field effect . at temperatures well below the optical phonon energy scale ,",
    "plasmons in high - quality gaas / algaas heterostructures  @xcite , for example , appear as very sharp peaks in inelastic light scattering spectra , displaying intriguing correlation and nonlocal effects at ultra - low electron densities  @xcite .",
    "the field of `` 2d plasmonics '' has been recently greatly revitalized by real - space investigations of plasmons in supported graphene sheets by means of scanning near - field optical microscopes  @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of graphene plasmons have also been carried out in graphene sheets encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) crystals  @xcite .",
    "these samples display nearly ideal transport characteristics  @xcite , whereby only one scattering mechanisms ( i.e.  electron - acoustic phonon scattering  @xcite ) fully determines dc transport times at room temperature , at least for sufficiently large carrier densities .",
    "room - temperature plasmons in hbn - encapsulated graphene sheets have been demonstrated  @xcite to display record - high confinement factors ( @xmath0 volume confinement ) and lifetimes approaching @xmath1 , the latter being solely limited by the weak scattering of electrons against graphene phonons .    in this article , we are interested in the scattering properties of 2d plasmons in parabolic - band electron gases and encapsulated graphene sheets . to this end , we lay down a lippmann - schwinger theory that enables us to calculate complex reflection and transmission coefficients for 2d plasmons impinging on a great variety of localized perturbations .",
    "scattering theories for surface plasmon polaritons in noble metals have been introduced in the past  @xcite .",
    "more recently , scattering of graphene plasmons against one - dimensional ( 1d ) defects has been studied in refs .  .",
    "in particular , the impact of electronic quasi - bound states on the scattering properties of plasmons has been recently studied in ref .  .",
    "the main difference between these earlier works and the theory presented in this article is that we use an _",
    "electrostatic approximation _ , instead of solving maxwell equations .",
    "this offers several advantages with respect to previous works : ( i ) our theory is essentially semi - analytical , requires little numerical effort , and , most importantly , takes into account _",

    "hamiltonian , instead of assuming phenomenological models for the spatial dependence of the conductivity profile ( as done in _ all _ papers , with the exception of ref .  )",
    "; ( iii ) we treat on equal footing many different perturbations ( not only electrostatic perturbations coupling to the electron density operator ) ; and ( iv ) we provide a recipe to include exchange and correlation effects _ beyond _ the celebrated random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , as we explain below in appendix  [ app : manybody ] .    the only disadvantage of our approach is that we are unable to describe scattering of plasmons into far - field modes of the electromagnetic field . in 2d electron gases in gaas / algaas heterostructures and graphene sheets ,",
    "these dissipative processes are usually very weak .",
    "the reason is that the plasmon momenta at play in these electron systems are much larger that the photon momentum @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that coupling to far - field modes of the electromagnetic field can occur only in the presence of extremely sharp defects / perturbations .",
    "however , experimentally realized ( electrostatic ) defects / perturbations for plasmons are smooth and are therefore unable to couple plasmons to photons .",
    "the situation is particularly `` extreme '' in hybrid heterostructures containing graphene , hbn , and nearby metal gates  @xcite .",
    "a metal gate in close proximity to graphene suppresses the long - range tail of the inter - electron coulomb interaction , morphing the usual 2d unscreened plasmon  @xcite with @xmath3 into an acoustic plasmon mode  @xcite with a phase velocity that is extremely close to the electron fermi velocity @xmath4 . for a given illumination frequency @xmath5",
    ", such acoustic plasmons have therefore momenta that are much larger that those of unscreened plasmons .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite where plasmons in such stacks were launched against smooth 1d electrostatic barriers show that our approximation is fully justified and that our theory explains in a fully quantitative fashion experimental data with _ no _ fitting parameters .",
