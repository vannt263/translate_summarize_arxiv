    "as @xmath23 is the number of photons present in the field and @xmath25 is a measure of correlation among @xmath26 photons , therefore @xmath27 or @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , a binomial state always shows hoa and the highest possible order of antibunching that can be seen in a binomial state is equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath23 is the number of photon present in the field . from ( [ eq : dl - binomial ] ) it is straight forward to see that the number state is always higher order antibunched and in the other extreme limit ( when @xmath29 and the bs reduces to coherent state ) @xmath30 which is consistent with the physical expectation .",
    "we have already mentioned that there are different form of generalized binomial states [ [ the : hong - chenfu - genralized - bs]-[the : hong - yi - fan - generalized - bs ] ] . for the present study we have chosen generalized binomial state introduced by roy and roy [ [ the : broy&proy - generalized - bs ] ] .",
    "they have introduced the generalized binomial state ( gbs ) as @xmath31 where , @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 this intermediate state reduces to vacuum state , number state , coherent state , binomial state and negative binomial state in different limits of @xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in order to obtain an analytic expression of @xmath25 for this particular generalized binomial state",
    "we need to prove following useful identity :    * identity1 : * @xmath38    proof : using ( [ eq : gen - bino3 ] ) we can write @xmath39 therefore , @xmath40    now it is easy to see that the above identity ( [ eq : identity 1 ] ) yields the following useful relations : @xmath41 and @xmath42 using ( [ eq : gen - bino1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gen - bino2 ] ) we can obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 has been used .",
    "now we can apply ( [ eq : relation1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relation2 ] ) on ( [ eq : relation 3 ] ) to obtain @xmath45 where dummy variable @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath46 therefore , @xmath47\\left[(\\alpha+1)(\\alpha+2) .....

    "the expression of @xmath25 is quite complex and it depends on various parameters ( e.g. @xmath50 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "fig 1 shows that for particular values of these parameters hoa is possible . as it is expected from the earlier works on the properties of hoa [ [ the : martin ] ] , the depth of nonclassicality is more in case of @xmath51 than in @xmath52 .",
    "this is consistent with earlier observation .",
    "a systematic study reveals that the probability of observing hoa increases with the increase of @xmath8 but it decreases ( i.e the probability of higher order bunching increases ) with the increase of @xmath36 . this can be seen clearly in fig2 and fig3 .",
    "further it is observed ( from fig1 and fig2 ) that for lower values of @xmath8 the probability of bunching increases with the increase of @xmath37 but for a comparatively large values of @xmath8 ( larger compare to @xmath36 ) the probability of hoa increases with the increase in @xmath37 [ see fig 2 ] but the situation is just opposite in the case of @xmath36 ( as it is seen from fig3 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ]    while studying different limiting cases of roy and roy generalized binomial state , we have observed that binomial state and number state always show hoa and @xmath53 for coherent state . this is consistent with the physical expectation and the conclusions of the last section .",
    "as it is mentioned in the earlier sections , there exist several different intermediate states . for the systematic study of possibility of observing hoa in intermediate states , we have studied all the well known intermediate states .",
    "since the procedure followed for the study of different states are similar , mathematical detail has not been shown in the subsections below .",
    "but from the expression of @xmath25 and the corresponding plots it would be easy to see that the hoa can be observed in all the intermediate states studied below",
    ".      reciprocal binomial state ( rbs ) can be defined as [ [ the : reciprocalbs ] ] @xmath54 where _ n _ is a normalization constant .",
    "using antinormal ordering and procedure adapted in section 3 , we can obtain;@xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the gamma function .",
    "the possibility of observing hoa in reciprocal binomial state can be clearly seen from the figure 4 .",
    "but it is interesting to note that the nature of singularity and zeroes present in the simplified expression of @xmath57 as expressed in the last line of ( [ eq : rbs2 ] ) can provide us some important information .",
    "for example , the underlying mathematical structure of the criterion of hoa and that of reciprocal binomial state demands that @xmath14 and @xmath37 be integers but if both of them are integer then @xmath57 has a singularity as the @xmath58 $ ] term present in the numerator blows up . but this local singularity can be circumvented by assuming @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this situation ( i.e. when @xmath14 and @xmath37 tends to integer value )",
    "@xmath61 is finite and consequently @xmath25 is also finite .",
    "this is the reason that the singular nature of the simplified expression of @xmath57 is not reflected in the figure 4 . in the analysis of the @xmath57",
    "it is also interesting to observe that @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and in an approximated situation when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the @xmath58 $ ] term in the numerator is no more singular and as a result@xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this situation",
    "one can observe hoa for arbitrarily large values of @xmath14 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus physically , it is expected that in reciprocal binomial state higher order antibunching of any arbitrary order will be seen and hoa will not be destroyed with the increase of @xmath37 , as it happens ( for some particular values of @xmath8 and @xmath36 ) in the case of generalized binomial state ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "following barnett [ [ the : barnett ] ] we can define negative binomial state ( nbs ) as    @xmath68    where @xmath69^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath70 and m is a non - negative integer .",
    "this intermediate state interpolates between number state and geometric state .",
    "following the mathematical techniques adopted in the earlier sections we obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a conventional hypergeometric function .",
    "variation of @xmath25 with various parameters such as @xmath73 and @xmath23 have been studied and are shown in figure 5- figure6 . from these figures",
    "one can observe that the state is not always antibunched , rather the plot of @xmath74 has a very sharp rise near @xmath75 and @xmath76 . from figure 5",
    "we can observe that the possibility of higher order bunching get destroyed with the increase of @xmath23 or @xmath77 .",
    "the second feature has clearly been shown in figure 6 , where we can see that @xmath74 become positive for a small region for @xmath78 but for a bigger region ( @xmath79 to @xmath80 ) it remains negative and thus shows the existence of hoa .",
    "the broad features remain same for the other orders ( other values of @xmath14 ) of antibunching .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the limit @xmath81 the negative binomial state reduces to geometric state ( gs ) . in this limit @xmath82",
    "reduces to @xmath83 it is interesting to observe that the above expression has a singularity at @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the limit @xmath86 .",
    "consequently one negative values of @xmath87 can be seen at very very small values @xmath77 but this is not the signatures of hoa , rather this is the signature of the existence of a strong singularity in the neighborhood .",
    "this can further justified by the fact that for any finite value of @xmath14 there does not exist any real root , ( whose value is close to zero or which is negligibly small compared to 1 ) of @xmath88 .",
    "thus there is no oscillation between bunching and antibunching .",
    "we further observe that @xmath89 in the limit @xmath90 and for @xmath91 there exists only one physically acceptable real root of @xmath88 . by physically acceptable real root we mean that it lies in @xmath92 $ ] . before this value of @xmath77 ( or before the physically acceptable real root ) the state shows higher order super poissonian photon statistics but immediately after the root it becomes negative and thus shows hoa or higher order subpoissonian photon statistics . as we increase @xmath14 the real root shifts in right side of the real axis ( i.e towards @xmath80 ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen in the figure 7 . from this figure",
    "it can be easily seen that it satisfies all the physical properties of hoa derived in [ [ the : martin ] ] .",
    "photon added coherent state ( [ eq : photonadded1 ] ) or pacs , which was introduced by agarwal and tara [ [ the : agarwal - photonadded ] ] can be defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is lauguere polynomial of @xmath95 order .",
    "rigorous operator algebra yields    @xmath96    where , @xmath97 is the generalized hypergeometric function . the analytic expression for @xmath98 is quite complicated and it is difficult to conclude anything regarding its photon statistics directly from ( [ eq : photonadded2 ] ) but we have investigated the variation of @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath10 and could not find any region which does not show hoa . therefore , hoa can be seen in this particular intermediate state .",
    "this fact is manifested in fig 8 and fig 9 . from these figures",
    "it is easy to observe that depth of nonclassicality increases monotonically with the increase of @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "the variation of depth of nonclassicality with @xmath8 has a deep for a small value of @xmath8 ( see fig 8 . and",
    "although @xmath99 is always negative , initially its magnitude ( @xmath98 without the negative sign ) increases , then decreases and then become a monotonically increasing function . actually for the smaller values of @xmath8 , an effective contribution from the combination of all the hypergeometric functions appears and dominates but as soon as @xmath8 increases a bit , the @xmath101 term starts dominating and as a consequence depth of nonclassicality increases monotonically .",
    "here we would also like to note that in contrast to the photon added coherent state , @xmath25 is always positive for the analogous state @xmath102 , introduced by sivakumar [ [ the : shiavakumar ] ] .",
    "thus @xmath102 always shows higher order superpoisonian photon statistics .",
    "further , we would like to note that photon added coherent state which , is intermediate between coherent and fock state has already been experimentally generated in 2004 [ [ the : photonadded - experiment ] ] .",
    "therefore , it is technically feasible to observe higher order antibunching for an intermediate state .      following [ [ the : hypergeomtric ] ] hypergeometric state ( hs )",
    "can be defined as @xmath103 where the probability @xmath77 is a real parameter satisfying @xmath104 @xmath105 is a real number satisfying @xmath106 @xmath107^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c } l\\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\label{eq : hyper3}\\ ] ] and @xmath108 here @xmath8 is not necessarily an integer . using the techniques adopted in the earlier sections and a bit of operator algebra we can obtain a closed form analytic expression for @xmath25 as @xmath109 from fig .",
    "10 it is clear that hoa can be observed in hypergeometric state .",
    "it is also observed that the depth of nonclassicality increases with the increase in @xmath77 and @xmath23 .",
    "hypergeometric state reduces to binomial state , coherent state , number state and vacuum state in different limits of @xmath110 @xmath105 and @xmath77 .",
    "it has been verified that if we impose those limits on @xmath111 then we obtain corresponding photon statistics .",
    "in essence all the intermediate states studied in the present paper"
