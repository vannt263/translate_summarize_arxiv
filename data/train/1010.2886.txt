    "vibro - impacting systems belong to a very interesting and important class of nonsmooth and nonlinear dynamical systems dibernardo2008,luo2006,awrejcewicz2003,filippov1988  with important technological applications stronge2000,mehta1994,knudsen1992,wiercigroch2008 .",
    "dynamics of such systems can be extremely complicated due to velocity discontinuity arising upon impacts .",
    "a very characteristic feature of such systems is the presence of nonstandard bifurcations such as border - collisions and grazing impacts which often lead to complex chaotic motions .",
    "the poincar map , describing evolution from an impact to the next impact , is a natural tool to study vibro - impacting systems .",
    "the main difficulty with investigating impacting systems is in finding instant of the next impact what typically involves solving a nonlinear equation .",
    "however , the problem can be simplified in the case of a bouncing ball dynamics assuming a special motion of the limiter .",
    "bouncing ball models have been extensively studied , see @xcite  and references therein . as a motivation that inspired this work ,",
    "we mention study of physics and transport of granular matter @xcite .",
    "a similar model has been also used to describe the motion of railway bogies @xcite .",
    "recently , we have considered several models of motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a limiter moving with piecewise constant velocity @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have proposed more realistic yet still simple models approximating sinusoidal motion of the table as exactly as possible but still preserving possibility of analytical compuations @xcite . in the present work we study the model in which displacement of the table is a quadratic and periodic function of time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a one dimensional dynamics of a ball moving in a gravitational field and colliding with a table is reviewed and the corresponding poincare map is constructed .",
    "a bifurcation diagram is computed for displacement of the table assumed as quadratic and periodic function of time . in the next section",
    "dynamical modes shown in the bifurcation diagram such as fixed points , @xmath0 - cycles and chaotic bands are studied analytically and numerically .",
    "it is shown that chaotic bands appear due to homoclinic structures created from unstable @xmath0 - cycles in a corner - type bifurcation .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "we consider a motion of a small ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving table , representing unilateral constraints .",
    "the ball is treated as a material point while the limiter s mass is assumed so large that its motion is not affected at impacts .",
    "a motion of the ball between impacts is described by the newton s law of motion:@xmath1where @xmath2 and motion of the limiter is:@xmath3with a known function @xmath4 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath4 is a continuous function of time .",

    "( [ point motion ] ) and applying impact conditions ( position ) , ( [ velocity ] ) we derive the poincar map @xcite :    [ tv ] @xmath14where @xmath15 .",
    "the limiter s motion has been typically assumed in form @xmath16 , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this choice leads to serious difficulties in solving the first of eqs.([tv ] ) for @xmath17 , thus making analytical investigations of dynamics hardly possible .",
    "accordingly , we have decided to simplify the limiter s periodic motion to make ( [ t ] ) solvable .    in our previous papers",
    "we have assumed displacement of the table as piecewise linear periodic function of time @xcite . in our recent work",
    "preliminary results for function @xmath18 assumed as quadratic @xmath19 and two cubic functions of time , @xmath20and @xmath21 have been obtained @xcite . in this work",
    "we study dynamics for quadratic function of time @xmath22 :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the floor function  the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath26 , in more detail .    since the period of motion of the limiter is equal to one , the map ( [ tv ] ) is invariant under the translation @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , all impact times @xmath28 can be reduced to the unit interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the model consists thus of equations ( [ tv ] ) , ( q ) with control parameters @xmath12 , @xmath30 .    in fig . 1 below we show the bifurcation diagram with times of impacts computed for growing @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see also @xcite where bifurcation diagram with velocities just after impacts against @xmath30 was shown ) .",

    "solutions ( [ fixsta ] ) fulfill physical requirements and are stable in the following interval of @xmath30:@xmath40where lower bound is a consequence of @xmath41 while the upper bound follows from the condition that eigenvalues @xmath42 of the stability matrix obey @xmath43 . on the other hand , solutions ( [ fixusta ] )",

    "1 , that there exists a stable @xmath46 - cycle with time of first impact @xmath47 and time of the second impact @xmath48 . such periodic solution must fulfill the following equations which are easily obtained from eqs .",
