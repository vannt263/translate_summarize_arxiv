    "the study of exact solutions of einstein s field equations is an important part of the theory of general relativity @xcite @xcite .",
    "this importance derives not only from more formal mathematical aspects associated with the theory ( e.g. the classification of space - times ) but also from the growing importance of the application of general relativity to astrophysical phenomena .",
    "for example , exact solutions can offer physical insights that numerical solutions can not .",
    "there are of course a very large number of exact solutions offered in the literature .",
    "however , these include numerous re - discoveries , confusions and errors . in a recent study of static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions , for example ,",
    "only 9 of 127 candidate solutions were found to be of physical interest @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that some of the earliest applications of computer algebra can be found in general relativity @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , no effective study of exact solutions in the large can be carried on without it . with the recent rapid development of the world wide web ( www ) as an means of information transfer",
    ", it has become an effective medium for cataloguing exact solutions .",
    "the first such use of the www is due to j. skea @xcite .",
    "skea s database is primarily a classification database @xcite .",
    "it is static in the sense that the information that can be retrieved is resident in the records .    in this paper",
    "we report on a non - static www based database , one for which the information that can be retrieved is not restricted to information resident in the records .",
    "this development has become feasible using more recent www technologies .",
    "this new database is now on line at _ http://grdb.org _ ( henceforth grdb ) using several java technologies and following a fully modular object - oriented design .",
    "the dynamic nature of the database is accomplished via the inclusion of grtensorj @xcite .",
    "this is an interactive programmable graphical user interface to the computer algebra system grtensorii @xcite which in turn runs under maple @xcite .",
    "grdb is designed to be a database of geometric objects in the general area of differential geometry with no a priori restriction on the number of dimensions .",
    "it contains exact solutions of einstein s field equations without being restricted to them . by design",
    "the database is highly interactive .",
    "the records ( manifolds ) are generally stored only in terms of a metric or a set of basis vectors along with constraints and referencing data .",
    "other elements can be calculated and displayed as required either interactively or from an extensive menu .",
    "the database is designed for researchers ( and teachers ) in applied mathematics , physics and related fields and it is hoped that the database will find use over a wide spectrum of interests .",
    "grdb offers many choices of operation .",
    "these operations are typically carried in the following order :    * \\i ) search the database by fields of particular interest . a search by keywords or by an equation number e.g. as listed in the  exact solutions book \" @xcite is implemented .",
    "other searches can be easily added as the project evolves , e.g. a search by the equation number as listed in any standard reference .",
    "the keyword choice searches the information field and the name of the metric field of each entry in the database .",
    "a common use is a search based on an author s surname ( e.g. kruskal ) .",
    "the key word search must be at least 3 characters .",
    "reference searches follow a simple referencing protocol .",
    "the search result is displayed in a list as shown on the bottom of figure [ homepage ] .",
    "the record short name is displayed as a hyper - link .",
    "the record naming convention is explained in appendix a. * \\ii ) select a record or records of interest from the search result list by clicking on its hyper - link .",
    "this will display a detailed description of the space - time starting with a suggestive line element representation of the record that is produced dynamically ( not stored ) .",
    "record details are then displayed as in figure [ recordpage ] with a structure adapted to the type of the record examined ( i.e. a metric , a tetrad or a basis type entry ) .",
    "* \\iii ) mark the viewed record(s ) to be loaded into the on line calculator grtensorj .",
    "this calculator is described further bellow .",
    "* \\iv ) click on the start calculator button from the database home page in order to launch grtensorj and to do on line calculations for the loaded records .",
    "* \\v ) click on `` load / select '' from the menu inside the calculator ( figure [ calculator ] ) and then click on `` load marked manifold(s ) from database '' .",
    "the tagged manifolds will appear as choices under load / select .",
    "click on the manifold you wish to use for calculations .",
    "this manifold is now loaded into the calculator and the user can now perform calculations .",
    "an extensive list of objects has already been implemented .",
    "this is summarized in appendix b. customized calculations are described below . * \\vi ) select the calculations commands through menu and sub - menu selections in the calculator as shown in figure [ calculator ] .",
    "the first step is to select a space - time in coordinates , tetrads or basis .",
    "this choice automatically displays the components of the metric tensor , the tetrads , or the basis components .",
    "then , the user can select the object(s ) to be calculated from the corresponding menus .",
    "after the result of the calculation is displayed the user can apply to it any simplification procedure supported by the engine as listed under `` simplifications '' in the menu bar .",
    "a help system is built into the menu system .",
    "further , the user can define new objects through the definition facilities within grtensorii .",
    "these are entered through a sub - interface and saved for the user s work session .",
    "there are also other support and option selection functions .",
    "it is especially important to note that if a manifold is represented with constraints ( e.g kruskal - szekeres ) then the constraints ( under  simplifications \" ) _ must _ be applied on the calculations , otherwise the user is not working with the selected manifold .",
    "a number of useful features are easily added to grtensorj . for example , automatic latex has been implemented @xcite .",
    "* \\vii ) new objects are defined in a sub - menu using the syntax of the grtensorii ` grdef ` facility @xcite .",
    "for example , the bel - robinson tensor ( though pre - defined ) would be entered as @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , there are objects that require an input from the user , e.g. the kinematical quantities associated with a field @xmath1 . in order to create an object , select a manifold , then select under the menu item `` custom '' the option `` create a new single definition object '' . follow the syntax explained under `` explanation '' and the example shown on the object input interface , e.g. @xmath2 \\ ; \\grave{}$ ] where @xmath3 etc .",
    "are the components .",
    "once the object is created , it is saved during the user s work session and related calculations can be performed , e.g. the acceleration , shear and rotation for @xmath1 . for a full description of the syntax the user may consult grtensorii @xcite documentation on the command `` grdef '' or browse the on line help system from the grtensorii www site @xcite . *",
    "\\viii ) input in the database .",
    "there are two forms of input into the database , a public input and a private input .",
    "it is our intention that all public input be refereed .",
    "private input is password protected and reserved for maintenance and internal operations .",
    "the list - all option is currently for private usage .",
    "the public input includes three types of interfaces ; a line element , a covariant or contravariant newman - penrose tetrad or a non - holonomic basis .",
    "figure [ publicinput ] gives an example of a line element input interface .",
    "grdb is built using fully modular client / server and object - oriented designs .",
    "it uses java servlet technology @xcite , a platform - independent mechanism for programming applications over the www .",
    "java is a pure object - oriented language , allowing multi - thread processes , specially adapted to network applications .",
    "java servlets are secure and portable applications that handle requests from a web server that are originating from a client web browser .",
    "the servlet runs on the server side and does not depend on the browser compatibility .",
    "java servlets also solve many access issue problems , as they can be used to develop fully distributed applications over the web where the database can be on separate machines .",
    "grdb also uses a jdbc ( java database connectivity ) module @xcite , a portable and flexible application that acts as an independent connector to the database , increasing the modularity of the architecture .",
    "postgresql @xcite was chosen and configured as the database management system ( dbms ) , a system that is also object - oriented and that brings to grdb all the power and performance of the structured query language ( sql ) commands .",
    "this language makes any kind of search or data manipulation very easy to implement .",
    "the sql instructions are formulated within the java servlet code .",
    "the web - pages used in order to manipulate the data are dynamic pages created while the programs are running .",
    "only the help pages were left static .",
    "this html is also embedded in the servlet code .",
    "the records ( manifolds ) are for the most part stored only in terms of a metric or set of basis vectors along with constraints and referencing data .",
    "this information is processed interactively through the servlets and grtensorj which in turn runs on maple .",
    "the program tth @xcite is used to translate tex into html in order to produce mathematical html text .",
    "grtensorj is also written in java and has been designed using a full object - oriented approach .",
    "in addition , all communication between the user and the server is object - based .",
    "grtensorj has a multi - layer architecture that allows the generic functionality described above .",
    "this architecture is outlined below :    * gui ( graphical user interface ) * user functional interface * user icm ( interchange module ) handler * interchange modules * server icm handler * server functional interface * algebraic engine - server structure    a java applet ( a programmed application that runs on the client side ) opens grtensorj by clicking on the applet button on grdb home page .",
    "it appears as in figure [ calculator ] . behind the scenes , a computer algebra session in grtensorii",
    "is started automatically .",
    "grtensorj uses maple @xcite as the algebraic engine .",
    "grtensorj is designed with an open architecture and is compatible with any other algebraic engine that can output an ascii stream .",
    "this architecture also allows it to be expanded and programmed by the user .",
    "the commands are accessed through menu and sub - menu selections .",
    "when a session begins , grtensorj reads a directory on the server named textsheets ( not to be confused with  worksheets \" ) and builds the menu and sub - menus for the interface from the underlying structure .",
    "all sub - directories to textsheets will appear as primary menu bar items .",
    "the names of ascii files contained within these sub - directories will be displayed as menu selections .",
    "these files contain a sequence of commands written in the syntax of the computer algebra engine being used . by selecting a menu item",
    "the user sends these commands to the engine .",
    "items to be displayed in the interface window are distinguished simply by an asterisk in the file .",
    "in other words , creating new menu items and calculation commands is as simple as creating and editing very simple ascii files .",
    "yet , the file , and resultant menu item , can be the equivalent of an entire worksheet with only the result chosen for display . of course , users need program nothing at all .",
    "the underlying simplicity of grtensorj is mentioned here simply to demonstrate its flexibility .",
    "when first released ( july 2001 ) , the database contained only about 300 entries .",
    "this is under continuous development and , for example , it is planed to have the entire content of @xcite and @xcite included in the database .",
    "an extension of the database to incorporate algorithmic classification is in progress @xcite as is the construction of specialized record data associated with , for example , static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by a grant ( to kl ) from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and by an ontario graduate scholarship ( to mi ) .",
