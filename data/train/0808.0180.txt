    "for a given weight function @xmath2 supported on a set @xmath3 , a cubature formula of degree @xmath4 is a finite sum , @xmath5 , that provides an approximation to the integral and preserves polynomials of degree up to @xmath4 ; that is , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the space of polynomials of total degree at most @xmath8 in @xmath9 variables .",
    "the points @xmath10 are called _ nodes _ and the numbers @xmath11 are called _ weights _ of the cubature .",
    "our primary interests are gaussian type cubature , which has minimal or nearer minimal number of nodes . for @xmath12",
    ", it is well known that gaussian quadrature of degree @xmath4 needs merely @xmath13 nodes and these nodes are precisely the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial of degree @xmath8 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the situation for @xmath14 , however , is much more complicated and not well understood in general . as in the case of @xmath12",
    ", it is known that a cubature of degree @xmath4 needs at least @xmath15 number of nodes , but few formulas are known to attain this lower bound ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for the centrally symmetric weight function ( symmetric with respect to the origin ) , it is known that the number of nodes , @xmath16 , of a cubature of degree @xmath4 in two dimension satisfies the lower bound @xmath17 known as mller s lower bound @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the nodes of a cubature that attains the lower bound , if it exists , are necessarily the common zeros of @xmath18 orthogonal polynomials of degree @xmath8 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "similar statements on the nodes hold for cubature formulas that have number of nodes slightly above mller s lower bound , which we shall call cubature of _ gaussian type_. these definitions also hold in @xmath9-dimension , where the lower bound for the number of nodes for the centrally symmetric weight function is given in @xcite .",
    "there are , however , only a few examples of such formulas that are explicitly constructed and fewer still can be useful for practical computation .",
    "the best known example is @xmath19^d$ ] with the weight function @xmath20 and only when @xmath21 . in this case , several families of gaussian type cubature are explicitly known , they were constructed ( @xcite ) by studying the common zeros of corresponding orthogonal polynomials , which are product chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and the second kind , respectively .",
    "furthermore , interpolation polynomials bases on the nodes of these cubature formulas turn out to possess several desirable features ( @xcite , and also @xcite ) . on the other hand , studying common zeros of orthogonal polynomials of several variables is in general notoriously difficult . in the case of",
    ", the product chebyshev polynomials have the simplest structure among all orthogonal polynomials , which permits us to study their common zeros and construct cubature formulas in the case @xmath22 , but not yet for the case @xmath23 or higher .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a completely different method for constructing cubature formulas with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it uses the discrete fourier analysis associated with lattice tiling , developed recently in @xcite .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite to establish cubature for _ trigonometric functions _ on the regular hexagon and triangle in @xmath26 , a topic that has been studied in @xcite , and on the rhombic dodecahedron and tetrahedron of @xmath27 in @xcite .",
    "the cubature on the hexagon can be transformed , by symmetry , to a cubature on the equilateral triangle that generates the hexagon by reflection , which can in turn be further transformed , by a nontrivial change of variables , to gaussian cubature formula for algebraic polynomials on the domain bounded by steiner s hypercycloid .",
    "the theory developed in @xcite uses two lattices , one determines the domain of integral and the points that defined the discrete inner product , the other determines the space of exponentials or trigonometric functions that are integrated exactly by the cubature . in @xcite",
    "the two lattices are taken to be the same . in this paper",
    "we shall choose one as @xmath28 itself , so that the integral domain is fixed as the cube , while we choose the other one differently . in @xmath21 ,",
    "we choose the second lattice so that its spectral set is a rhombus , which allows us to establish cubature formulas for trigonometric functions that are equivalent to gaussian type cubature formulas for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the case of @xmath29",
    ", we choose the rhombic dodecahedron as a tiling set and obtain a cubature of degree @xmath4 that uses @xmath30 nodes , worse than the expected lower bound of @xmath31 but far better than the product gaussian cubature of @xmath32 nodes .",
    "this cubature with @xmath30 nodes has appeared recently and tested numerically in @xcite .",
    "we will further study the lagrange interpolation based on its nodes , for which the first task is to identify the subspace that the interpolation polynomials belongs .",
    "we will not only identify the interpolation space , but also give the compact formulas for the fundamental interpolation polynomials .",
    "one immediate question arising from this study is if there exist cubature formulas of degree @xmath4 with @xmath33 nodes on the cube .",
    "although examples of cubature formulas of degree @xmath4 with @xmath34 nodes are known to exist for special non - centrally symmetric regions ( @xcite ) , we are not aware of any examples for symmetric domains that use @xmath35 nodes . from our approach of tiling and discrete fourier analysis",
    ", it appears that the rhombic dodecahedron gives the smallest number of nodes among all other fundamental domains that tile @xmath27 by translation .",
    "giving the fact that this approach yields the cubature formulas with optimal order for the number of nodes , it is tempting to make the conjecture that a cubature formula of degree @xmath4 on @xmath0 ^ 3 $ ] needs at least @xmath30 nodes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we recall the result on discrete fourier analysis and lattice tiling in @xcite .",
