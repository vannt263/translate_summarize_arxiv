    "studying entanglement of degrees of freedom of a quantum system on its physical boundary is an interesting and motivated problem .",

    "one of the possibilities to probe this phenomenon is to consider entanglement across a spatial entangling surface ( denoted further as @xmath0 ) and to assume that @xmath0 ends on the boundary of the system .",
    "some of the effects at the intersection of the two surfaces may be rather complicated since they depend on the material the boundary is made of . as studies of the casimir effect in real media show , taking into account these properties may be a challenging problem . in this paper",
    "we follow a common approach and assume idealized boundaries with conditions of the dirichlet type .",
    "we consider such an approach as a first step toward understanding more physical conditions .",

    "@xmath0 was assumed to be orthogonal to the boundary .",
    "these results can be extended to rnyi entropies which have a similar geometrical structure . by taking into account results of @xcite-@xcite",
    "one expects the following asymptotic behaviour of ere in a four dimensional spacetime : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an order of a rnyi entropy ( see the definition in sec .",

    "the canonical mass dimensions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "a primary motivation is that @xmath13 is related to the trace anomaly of the stress tensor .",
    "another motivation is that in lower dimensions the boundary contributions to analogous logarithmic terms carry an important physical information .",
