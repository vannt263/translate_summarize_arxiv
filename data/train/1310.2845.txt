    "the _ kepler _ mission has started a new and much more detailed chapter on asteroseismology . before launch ,",
    "only a few stars exhibiting solar - like oscillations had been studied with sufficient detail to allow the necessary analysis ; however _ kepler _ has made it possible to perform asteroseismology of thousands of stars @xcite , enabling the detection of not only acoustic modes but also of mixed modes in evolved stars @xcite .    while _ kepler _ is a marvelous instrument for many aspects of asteroseismology , it is limited in other respects .",
    "stars exhibit more intrinsic noise relative to their asteroseismic amplitudes in intensities than in radial velocities . as such",
    ", it is possible to detect oscillation frequencies to much higher precision and at lower frequencies with radial - velocity observations than using intensities .",
    "the lower - frequency modes have longer lifetimes , which in turn allow the frequencies to be measured with a higher degree of accuracy .",
    "moreover , they allow us to study the helium abundance in the envelope via the `` acoustic glitch '' , an observable phenomenon which arises from helium ionization @xcite , and they are less affected by the near - surface effects in the stellar models @xcite .    furthermore , it is possible to detect @xmath0 modes through radial - velocity measurements , which supply further information about the stellar core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this represents a major advantage of radial velocity time - series observations of solar - like oscillations , as intensity observations can only make marginal detections of such modes , even from space .",
    "we also note that radial - velocity measurements in general focus on much brighter stars than those observed by _ kepler _ , which means that more information about the stars is available from other sources , such as interferometry , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of radial - velocity modulations caused by solar - like oscillations requires ultra - high precision measurements , on the order of 1 ms@xmath1 with time series of several days or weeks if not more in length .",
    "temporal coverage also has a strong impact on detection : the lower the temporal coverage , the longer the time baseline needs to be and the more pronounced the window function becomes .",
    "currently , only a very few instruments are capable of reaching the necessary precision and these are in high demand , making it difficult to obtain enough telescope time to perform these studies .",
    "song ( stellar observations network group , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an instrument designed for this very purpose .",
    "it is a proposed network of robotic 1 m telescopes with spectrographs capable of reaching a radial - velocity precision of 1ms@xmath1 on stars down to magnitude @xmath2 . currently , song has one node under commissioning in tenerife and another under construction in china , with additional nodes expected to be added in the future .",
    "it is therefore very important for the project that we evaluate the impact of the number of nodes on the scientific return of song . in this paper , we explore how the number of nodes in song will affect the detection of solar - like oscillations across regions of the hr diagram where such variations are expected , focussing on stars on or near the main sequence .",
    "are effects of the assumed length of night of 8h.,width=317 ]     and the small frequency separation @xmath3 for stellar models with masses between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the models are from @xcite , see their paper for details .",
    "the stars evolve from the top of the tracks and down toward lower values for both @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "the location of the sun in this diagram has been indicated by the solar symbol ( note that the models have not been calibrated to match the sun precisely).,width=359 ]",
    "we study three different idealized configurations of nodes , each node assumed to be observing for 8 hours : a single node ( 33% temporal coverage ) , two nodes ( 67% coverage ) and three nodes ( 100% coverage ) in order to investigate to what level the resulting spectral window functions which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.windows ] , cause overlap between different oscillation modes in the amplitude spectrum .",
    "such overlaps are detrimental to the analysis of the stellar oscillations , which is a primary motivation for constructing a telescope network .",
    "we use the asymptotic relation to predict the oscillation frequencies for different combinations of the large and small frequency separations across the so - called c - d diagram , which plots the large and the small frequency separation against each other @xcite .",
    "we then use stellar models to combine the results from the analysis of overlapping peaks across the c - d diagram with two other , important observables ; the mode lifetimes ( which affect the mode linewidths ) and amplitudes of the solar - like oscillations . by doing so",
    ", we identify the areas in the hr diagram where solar - like oscillations can be observed and analysed with the different song - node configurations . for clarity , we break this analysis into two parts : the first exploring the impact of the window function on detection given a fixed mode linewidth , then adding in the effects of realistic linewidths and amplitudes for stars of different ages and masses for the second part .",
    "we focus on general trends in the present study , and disregard effects of weather , instrumental problems etc . , which modify the window function and increase the noise level of the observations , as well as effects of rotation , which affects the linewidths of the frequency peaks .",
    "we also do not include mixed modes , which is a complicating factor in the analysis of evolved stars .      before the impact of the window function on the detectability of solar - like oscillations can be assessed , the basics of solar - like oscillations need to be addressed .",
    "solar - like oscillations are acoustic oscillations which approximately follow the asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radial order , @xmath9 is the angular degree , @xmath6 is the large frequency separation between modes of same @xmath9 ( which measures the mean density of the star ) , @xmath10 is sensitive to the surface layers , and is set to @xmath11 in this work , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the small frequency separation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 modes ( which is sensitive to the age of the star ) .",
    "we assume in this study that all stars follow this relation , and we assume that the large and small frequency separations are constant across the entire frequency spectrum .",
    "the frequency separations mentioned above are not enough by themselves to assess the impact of the window function  the analysis requires the oscillation frequencies themselves .",
    "we calculate these using the asymptotic relation for the values of @xmath6 and @xmath3 covering the stellar evolutionary tracks depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.cdclean ] , for modes with @xmath16 .              to facilitate the discussion of the mode overlap we introduce modified window functions @xmath17 , where @xmath18 correspond to the number of nodes .",
    "these are defined by modifying the original window functions to reflect peaks whose intrinsic width @xmath19hz is determined by the assumed length of 30 days of the time series , combined with a lorentzian with a width determined by the mode lifetime .",
    "here we have assumed a mode lifetime for solar - like oscillations similar to that of the sun ( 3 days )  a reasonable simplification for the purpose of studying the impact of the spectral window functions .",
    "the relationship between the mode lifetime ( @xmath20 ) and the natural linewidth @xmath21 of the mode yields @xmath22hz . in practice",
    "we constructed @xmath23 by an iterative process , where we smooth the original window function until it has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath24hz .",
    "this corresponds roughly to adding the intrinsic width of the window function and the natural mode linewidth in quadrature .",
    "the peak amplitudes of the modified window functions are kept at 1.0 .",
    "when constructing the amplitude spectra , we also use the fact that modes with different @xmath9-values have different spatial response functions , or sensitivities , for line - of - sight doppler observations .",
    "these are denoted @xmath25 , and lead to perceived differences in amplitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the sensitivity of @xmath14 is set to 1.00 , @xmath26 to 1.36 , @xmath15 to 1.03 and @xmath0 to 0.48 .",
    "+ we now construct the amplitude spectra @xmath27 by combining the frequencies , @xmath28 , with the modified window functions , and taking into account the @xmath9-dependent sensitivities , @xmath25 : @xmath29 note that by simply adding the amplitude contributions from each mode we ignore the interference between the modes , depending on their relative phases , which would affect a more realistic combination of the contributions in fourier space ( or the time domain ) .",

    "<S> while _ kepler _ has pushed the science of asteroseismology to limits unimaginable a decade ago , the need for asteroseismic studies of individual objects remains . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily due to the limitations of single - colour intensity variations , which are much less sensitive to certain asteroseismic signals . </S>",
    "<S> the best way to obtain the necessary data is via very high resolution ground - based spectrography . </S>",
    "<S> such observations measure the perceived radial - velocity shifts that arise due to stellar oscillations , which exhibit a much better signal - to - noise ratio than those for intensity observations . </S>",

    "<S> another under construction in china , an analysis of the scientific benefits of constructing additional nodes for the network is warranted . by convolving models of asteroseismic observables ( mean densities , small separations ) with the anticipated window functions for different node configurations , we explore the impact of the number of nodes in the song network on the anticipated results , across the areas of the hr diagram where solar - like oscillations are found . </S>",
    "<S> we find that although time series from two song nodes , or in some cases even one node , will allow us to detect oscillations , the full song network , providing full temporal coverage , is needed for obtaining the science goals of song , including analysis of modes of spherical harmonic degree @xmath0 .    </S>",
