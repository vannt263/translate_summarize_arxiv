    "saddlepoint approximations ( spas ) provide effective methods for approximating probability density functions and tail probability distribution functions , using their cumulant generating functions ( cgfs ) . in mathematical statistics ,",
    "spa methods originated with daniels ( 1954 ) , in which an approximation formula was given for the density function of the sample mean @xmath2 of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d.)random variables @xmath3 , provided that the law of @xmath4 has the density function .",
    "lugannani and rice ( 1980 ) derives the following approximation formula for the right tail probability : @xmath5 as @xmath6 . here ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the standard normal distribution function and its density function @xmath9 , respectively , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are expressed by using the cgf @xmath12 of @xmath4 and the saddlepoint @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "that is , @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "related spa formulae have been studied in daniels ( 1987 ) , jensen ( 1995 ) , kolassa ( 1997 ) , butler ( 2007 ) , the references therein , and others .    strictly , the lugannani  rice ( lr ) formula ( [ original_lr ] ) should be interpreted as an asymptotic result as @xmath17 .",
    "however , it is popular in many practical applications of financial engineering as an approximation formula for the right tail probability because of its tractability .",
    "this approximation is @xmath18    in other words , lr formula ( [ original_lr ] ) is applied even when @xmath19 is @xmath20 ! for financial applications of spa formulae , we refer the readers to papers such as rogers and zane ( 1999 ) , xiong , wong , and salopek ( 2005 ) , at - sahalia and yu ( 2006 ) , yang , hurd , and zhang ( 2006 ) , glasserman and kim ( 2009 ) , and carr and madan ( 2009 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the approximation formula ( [ 0th_lr ] ) still works surprisingly well in many financial examples , despite its lack of theoretical justification .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a measure of the effectivity of the `` generalized usage '' of the lr formula ( [ 0th_lr ] ) from an asymptotic theoretical viewpoint .",
    "we consider a general parametrized sequence of random variables @xmath21 and assume that the @xmath22th cumulant of @xmath23 has order @xmath24 as @xmath25 for each @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 converges in law to a normally distributed random variable ( a motivation is provided for this assumption in remark [ rem_a5 ] of section [ sec_order ] ) .",
    "we next derive the expansion @xmath27 which we call the exact lr expansion ( see theorem 1 of section 2 ) . here , @xmath28 is given by ( [ def_sp ] ) and ( [ def_w_eps ] ) , and the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are given by ( [ def_psi_m ] ) .",
