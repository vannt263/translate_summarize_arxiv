    "exactly solvable models with phase transitions play a special role in the statistical physics - they are the benchmarks of our understanding of critical phenomena that occur in more complicated substances .",
    "they are our theoretical laboratories , where we can study the most fundamental problems of critical phenomena which can not be studied elsewhere .",
    "a great deal of progress was recently achieved in our understanding of the multifragmentation phenomenon @xcite when an exact analytical solution of a simplified version of the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite was found in refs .",
    "this exact solution allowed us to elucidate the role of the fisher exponent @xmath0 on the properties of ( tri)critical point and to show explicitly @xcite that in the smm the relations between @xmath0 and other critical indices differ from the corresponding relations of a well known fisher droplet model @xcite .",
    "note that these questions _ in principle _ can not be clarified either within the widely used mean - filed approach or numerically .    despite this success ,",
    "the application of the exact analytical solution @xcite to the description of experimental data is very limited because this solution corresponds to an infinite system volume . to extend the formalism for finite volumes",
    "it is necessary to account for the finite size and geometrical shape of the largest fragments , if they are comparable with the system volume .",
    "it is clear that these corrections may be important for not too dilute systems .",
    "therefore , to have a more realistic model it is necessary to abandon the arbitrary size of largest fragment and consider the constrained smm ( csmm ) in which the largest fragment size is explicitly related to the volume @xmath1 of the system . this will allow us to solve the csmm analytically at finite volumes , to consider how the first order phase transition develops from the singularities of the isobaric partition @xcite in thermodynamic limit , and to study the finite size effects for large fragments .",
    "the system states in the smm are specified by the multiplicity sets @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4-nucleon fragments .",
    "the partition function of a single fragment with @xmath4 nucleons is @xcite : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the total number of nucleons in the system ) , @xmath1 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the volume and the temperature of the system , @xmath9 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the first two factors on the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the single fragment partition originate from the non - relativistic thermal motion and the last factor , @xmath10 , represents the intrinsic partition function of the @xmath4- nucleon fragment .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath11 is a phase space density of the k - nucleon fragment . for ( nucleon )",
    "we take @xmath12 ( 4 internal spin - isospin states ) and for fragments with @xmath13 we use the expression motivated by the liquid drop model ( see details in @xmath14 with fragment free energy @xmath15k",

    "( [ two ] ) the nuclear fragments are treated as point - like objects . however , these fragments have non - zero proper volumes and they should not overlap in the coordinate space . in the excluded volume ( van der waals )",
    "approximation this is achieved by substituting the total volume @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) by the free ( available ) volume @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29  @xmath30 is the normal nuclear density ) .",
    "therefore , the corrected cpf becomes : @xmath31 .",
    "the smm defined by eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) was studied numerically in refs .",
    "this is a simplified version of the smm , e.g. the symmetry and coulomb contributions are neglected .",
    "however , its investigation appears to be of principal importance for studies of the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the calculation of @xmath32 is difficult because of the constraint @xmath33 .",
    "this difficulty can be partly avoided by calculating the grand canonical partition function : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a chemical potential .",
    "the calculation of @xmath36 is still rather difficult .",
    "the summation over @xmath2 sets in @xmath37 can not be performed analytically because of additional @xmath7-dependence in the free volume @xmath38 and the restriction @xmath39 .",
    "this problem was resolved @xcite by the laplace transformation method to the so - called isobaric ensemble @xcite .    in this work",
    "we would like to consider a more strict constraint @xmath40 , where the size of the largest fragment can not exceed the total volume of the system ( the parameter @xmath41 is introduced for convenience ) .",
    "a similar restriction should be also applied to the upper limit of the product in all partitions @xmath42 , @xmath32 and @xmath43 introduced above ( how to deal with the real values of @xmath44 , see later ) . then the model with this constraint , the csmm ,",
    "can not be solved by the laplace transform method , because the volume integrals can not be evaluated due to a complicated functional @xmath1-dependence .",
    "however , the csmm can be solved analytically with the help of the following identity @xmath45 which is based on the fourier representation of the dirac @xmath46-function .",
    "the representation ( [ four ] ) allows us to decouple the additional volume dependence and reduce it to the exponential one , which can be dealt by the usual laplace transformation . indeed , with the help of ( [ four ] ) the laplace transform of the csmm grand canonical partition ( gcp ) ( [ three ] )",

    "the isobaric partition ( [ seven ] ) of the csmm is , of course , more complicated than its smm analog @xcite because for finite volumes the structure of singularities in the csmm is much richer than in the smm , and they match in the limit @xmath55 only . to see this",

    "for @xmath78 the real root @xmath79 exists for any @xmath8 and @xmath35 . since for @xmath80",

    "( [ eleven ] ) one obtains @xmath82 where the second inequality ( [ thirteen ] ) immediately follows from the first one .",
    "note that the second inequality ( [ thirteen ] ) plays a decisive role in the thermodynamic limit @xmath55 because in this case it generates the pressure of the gaseous phase .",
    "like in the usual smm @xcite , for infinite volume the effective chemical potential must be real and non - positive , @xmath83 , because in the latter case the function @xmath84 ( [ seven ] ) diverges and the formal manipulations in ( [ five ] ) to establish ( [ six ] ) can not be used .",
    "the limiting value @xmath85 defines the liquid phase singularity of the isobaric partition which gives the liquid pressure @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "but for finite volumes and finite @xmath87 the effective chemical potential can be complex ( with either sign for its real part ) and its value defines the number and position of the imaginary roots @xmath88 in the complex plane . consider the natural values of @xmath87 , first . as it is seen from fig",
    ". 1 . , the r.h.s . of ( [ twelve ] )",
    "is the amplitude and frequency modulated sine - like function of dimensionless parameter @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , depending on @xmath8 and @xmath90 values there may exist either zero , or finite or infinite number of complex roots @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "1 . we showed a special case which corresponds to exactly three roots of eq .",
    "( [ ten ] ) for each value of @xmath87 : the real root ( @xmath92 ) and two complex conjugate roots ( @xmath93 ) . since the r.h.s . of ( [ twelve ] ) is monotonously increasing function of @xmath90 , when the former is positive , then it is possible to map the @xmath94 plane into regions of a fixed number of roots of eq .",

    "of ( [ fifteen ] ) describes the partial pressure generated by the simple pole @xmath103 weighted with the `` probability '' @xmath104 , whereas the second and third terms appear due to the volume dependence of @xmath87 .",
    "note that , instead of the fv corrections , the usage of natural values for @xmath105 would generate the artificial delta - function terms in ( [ fifteen ] ) for the volume derivatives .",
    "as one can see from ( [ fifteen ] ) for finite volumes the corrections can give a non - negligible contribution to the pressure because in this case @xmath106 can be positive .",
    "the real parts of the partial pressures @xmath107 may have either sign . therefore , according ( [ thirteen ] ) the positive pressures @xmath108 are metastable and the negative ones @xmath109 are mechanically unstable .",
    "the pair of complex conjugate roots with the same value of @xmath110 corresponds to a formation and decay of those states in thermodynamical system at finite volumes .    when @xmath1 increases the number of simple poles in ( [ eight ] ) also increases and imaginary part of the closest to the real @xmath57-axis poles becomes very small .",
    "for infinite volume the infinite number of simple poles moves toward the real @xmath57-axis to the vicinity of liquid phase singularity @xmath111 and , thus , generates an essential singularity of function @xmath112 in ( [ seven ] ) . in this case the contribution of any of remote poles from the real @xmath57-axis to the gcp vanishes .",
    "then it can be shown that the fv corrections in ( [ fifteen ] ) become negligible because of the inequality @xmath113 , and , consequently , the reduced distribution of largest fragment @xmath114 and the derivative @xmath102 vanish for all @xmath8-values , and we obtain the usual smm solution @xcite , and its thermodynamics is governed by the farthest right singularity in complex @xmath57-plane .",
    "the corrections of a similar kind should appear in the entropy , particle number and energy density because of the @xmath8 and @xmath35 dependence of @xmath115 due to ( [ ten ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , these corrections should be taking into account while analyzing the experimental yields of fragments .",
    "then the phase diagram of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition can be recovered from the experiments on finite systems ( nuclei ) with more confidence .",
    "also it is possible that the metastable and unstable modes can emerge in the dynamically expanding system created in experiments , or even there may exist a direct relation between these modes and the spinodal instabilities discussed with respect to phase transition in finite systems @xcite , but it is theme of the other work .",
