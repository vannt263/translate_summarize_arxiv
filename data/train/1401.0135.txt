    "such phenomenon , referred to as the electronic ratchet effect  @xcite , has been attracting much attention stimulated by both fundamental and applied interest in high - frequency non - linear electron transport at nanoscale  @xcite . by its origin , the ratchet transport can occur only in structures with space inversion asymmetry and , therefore , it provides a powerful tool to study the symmetry properties of nanostructures , anisotropy of the band structure , electron - phonon and electron - impurity interactions and etc .",
    "intrinsic and extrinsic ratchet mechanisms can awake the additional carrier degrees of freedom and drive spin  @xcite and valley  @xcite currents .",
    "the application of an external static magnetic field breaks the time inversion symmetry giving rise to new mechanisms of current formation .",
    "in particular , it enables the magnetic quantum ratchet effect recently demonstrated for graphene layers excited by electromagnetic wave of terahertz ( thz ) range  @xcite .",

    "we show that the excitation of the electron gas in the inversion channel of si - mosfets subjected to an in - plane magnetic field by @xmath0 electric field , here of thz radiation , leads to a direct electric current between the unbiased source and drain contacts .",

    "<S> we present the quasi - classical and quantum theories of the observed effect and show that the current originates from the lorentz force acting upon carriers in asymmetric inversion channels of the transistors . </S>"
