    "<S> we investigate , both analytically and by computer simulation , the kinetics of a microscopic model of hard rods adsorbing on a linear substrate . for a small , but finite desorption rate , the system reaches the equilibrium state very slowly , and the long - time kinetics display three successive regimes : an algebraic one where the density varies as @xmath0 , a logarithmic one where the density varies as @xmath1 , followed by a terminal exponential approach . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field approach fails to predict the relaxation rate associated with the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the correct answer can only be provided by using a systematic description based on a gap - distribution approach .    in many situations , </S>",
    "<S> thermal energies are significantly smaller than the energy needed for hard particles to diffuse , and under applied external forces the system evolves towards non - equilibrium configurations , metastable configurations , or eventually reaches a stable equilibrium state after a very slow process . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the adsorption of some proteins and colloidal particles on solid surfaces@xcite involves particle - surface energies that are so strong that the process is characterized by extremely small desorption and surface diffusion on the experimental time scale . in granular materials , </S>",
    "<S> particles are trapped in a metastable configuration , unless external energy is brought to the system . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments@xcite measured the densification of a vibrated granular material . a column containing monodisperse spherical beads </S>",
    "<S> was tapped periodically with a given intensity and the powder evolved slowly , essentially as the inverse of the logarithm of the number of taps , from a loosely packed state to a denser steady state whose density depends on the tapping strength . </S>",
    "<S> in all these cases , geometric exclusion effects dictate the kinetics of densification , i.e. , addition of new particles is exponentially limited by the inverse of the free volume@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are accounted for in a simple adsorption - desorption model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its one - dimensional version , also known as the parking lot model , was shown to display a @xmath2 approach to the final state for vanishing desorption rate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , ben naim _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite proposed an approximate solution of the model for a small but non - zero desorption rate . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here the solution and show that the mean - field treatment ( or adiabatic approximation ) used in the late stage of the process is not valid and greatly underestimates the characteristic time of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a more consistent approximation which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the general definition of the adsorption - desorption model is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> attempts are made to add objects to a space of arbitrary dimension at randomly selected positions with a constant rate @xmath3 . if the trial position does not result in an overlap with a previously placed object , the new object is accepted . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , all objects in the system are subject to removal ( desorption ) at random with a constant rate @xmath4 . in the parking lot model , </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is a line and the objects are hard rods . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath5-d model has been solved in some limiting cases . when @xmath6 , the adsorption is totally irreversible and the process corresponds to a @xmath5-d random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) for which the kinetics are known exactly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to the absence of relaxation mechanism , this process evolves towards a non - equilibrium state and the long - time kinetics are given by an algebraic scaling law , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath9 , one recovers a desorption process for which analytical solutions are also available@xcite . in the limit @xmath10 , accurate descriptions have been obtained@xcite . in this case , the process cleanly divides into two sub - processes . </S>",
    "<S> the initial phase consists of an irreversible adsorption and it is followed by an infinite sequence of desorption - adsorption events in which a rod detaches from the surface and the gap that is created is immediately filled by one or two new rods . </S>",
    "<S> the latter possibility causes the system to evolve continuously to the close - packed state with @xmath11 , as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 now represents a rescaled time . for the general case , where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are non zero </S>",
    "<S> , no complete solution is available .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the parking lot model depend only on the ratio @xmath16 . with an appropriate rescaled time </S>",
    "<S> , the kinetic equation describing the evolution of the density of adsorbed particles is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the insertion probability at time @xmath13 ( or density @xmath19 ) , is the fraction of the substrate that is available for the insertion of a new particle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , large values of @xmath20 correspond to small desorption rates . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a relaxation mechanism , even infinitesimally small , implies that the system eventually reaches a steady state that corresponds to an equilibrium configuration of hard particles with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the equilibrium density . at equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the insertion probability is given exactly by @xmath23 inserting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phieq ] ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinet ] ) leads to the following expression for the equilibrium density : @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( the lambert - w function ) is the solution of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit of small @xmath20 the isotherm takes the langmuir form ( @xmath27 ) while for large @xmath20 , @xmath28 . at small values of @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , equilibrium is rapidly obtained , but at large values the densification is extremely slow . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to the latter case . in the initial stages of the process , </S>",
    "<S> desorption events are negligible compared to adsorption and the process displays an rsa - like behavior . a shows simulation results ( see below for details ) for the density versus @xmath0 in the intermediate density region ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the value of @xmath20 , the larger the scaling law region . for @xmath30 , which implies @xmath31 , desorption can no longer be ignored , because it permits particle rearrangements on the line and , eventually , insertion of additional particles . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for densification is similar to that of the model with infinitely small desorption and the kinetics is dominated by the @xmath32 term ( b ) . for large but finite values of @xmath20 , this regime persists until the density is very close to the equilibrium value and the desorption term is comparable to the adsorption term . in the final regime , an exponential approach to equilibrium is observed ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this terminal approach corresponds to the linear response regime .    to determine the kinetics of the densification process </S>",
    "<S> , a knowledge of @xmath33 is required . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equations can be expressed by means of the gap distribution functions @xmath34 which represents the density of voids of length @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the time derivative of @xmath34 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gap - gap distribution function and @xmath38 is the unit step function . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqcin1 ] ) correspond to the loss and gain terms due to adsorption while the remaining two are due to desorption . </S>",
    "<S> a similar equation can be written for @xmath37 , and it requires higher - order gap distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , even though it is one - dimensional , this kind of process leads to an infinite hierarchy of equations involving an infinite set of multi - gap distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> only approximate solutions can be obtained , by means of closure ansatz that enables the truncation of the hierarchy .    </S>",
    "<S> the insertion probability can be expressed in terms of the gap distribution function as @xmath39 and we have in addition the following sum rules : @xmath40 the exact expression for the equilibrium structure is known @xcite ; the gap distribution function is @xmath41 and all higher - order distribution functions satisfy the factorization property , @xmath42 an adiabatic ( mean - field ) approximation assumes that , at any density @xmath43 , the structure of the adsorbate acquires very rapidly an equilibrium form satisfying eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ geq ] ) and  ( [ factor ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an expression for @xmath18 akin to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phieq ] ) with @xmath43 in place of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , expanding eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinet ] ) to first order in density , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , one obtains @xmath47 with @xmath48 which implies an exponential approach to the equilibrium state with a relaxation time given by @xmath49 for large @xmath20 . using a very efficient algorithm for the adsorption - desorption processes @xcite , we have performed monte - carlo simulations for k ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> averages were taken over @xmath51 independent runs . </S>",
    "<S> b shows the relaxation rate versus @xmath20 : the full curve gives the mean - field prediction , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aeq ] ) , and dots correspond to simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the mean - field analysis gives a poor estimate of the relaxation rate for large @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with adsorption models with fast diffusion@xcite , the mean - field approximation is not valid here ; the desorption mechanism becomes so inefficient for large @xmath20 that the system does not follow a quasi - static path even for the regression of small fluctuations to equilibrium . in </S>",
    "<S> , one observes that the insertion probability @xmath52 displays a non - monotonic behavior at long times for @xmath53 , and _ approaches the equilibrium value from below_. hence , at long times , the time derivative of @xmath18 becomes positive . </S>",
    "<S> as the density remains an increasing function of time along the entire process , the density derivative of the insertion probability is positive and bounded by @xmath54 by virtue of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinet ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this shows also that the relaxation rate is smaller than @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> ( let us recall that both the density and time derivatives of @xmath18 are always negative in the adiabatic approximation . )    to obtain the leading term in the exponential approach towards equilibrium , when @xmath20 is very large ( but finite ) , we assume that , as for the steady state , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . as a consequence , if one defines @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then @xmath59 , so that if one looks for the dominant behavior in @xmath54 , it is sufficient to consider the first intervals in @xmath35 . as in the adiabatic approximation , one can expand the gap densities in power of @xmath60 and keep only the linear term which gives rise to the exponential decay . more specifically , by introducing @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a piecewise continuous function , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqcin1 ] ) can be rewritten for @xmath63 as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the equilibrium pressure for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinet ] ) and  ( [ phi ] ) , one obtains @xmath68 whereas the sum rules in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho ] ) give @xmath69 when integrating the two sides of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rules ] ) between @xmath70 and @xmath5 , one obtains to first order in @xmath54 @xmath71 combining eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gameq ] ) with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) yields @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the relaxation rate is an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by the mean - field treatment . </S>",
    "<S> it is actually given by ( recall @xmath73 ) @xmath74    @xmath75    in order to obtain explicitly the coefficient of the leading term in @xmath76 , one needs to solve eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqcin1 ] ) for @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by assuming that the factorization property for the two - gap distribution function is _ valid _ to a @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> doing this , and after some tedious algebra , we have been able to derive the expression for @xmath62 , i.e. , for the gap distribution function at linear order in @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the result , which is too lengthly to be presented in this letter , is of course different from that of the mean - field approximation and it compares very well with the simulation data@xcite . ) it leads to the following dominant behavior for very large @xmath20 : @xmath80 in b the dashed curve corresponding to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aex ] ) gives a good agreement with the simulation results , contrary to the mean - field predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the time correlations of the density fluctuations @xmath60 around the equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have evaluated @xmath81 we have verified that at long time , the correlation function decays exponentially with a relaxation rate which is the same as that obtained by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aex ] ) , in agreement with onsager linear regression principle . both the fluctuation - dissipation relation and the time translational invariance are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> however , ( interrupted ) aging@xcite is expected in the @xmath1-regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank r. muralidhar who * proposed * the simulation algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> travel support from nsf and cnrs is also acknowledged . </S>"
