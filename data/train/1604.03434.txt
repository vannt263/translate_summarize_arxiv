    "<S> charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the @xmath0-nucleon strong interaction generates a charge dependence of @xmath0 separation energies in mirror hypernuclei , which in the case of the @xmath1 mirror hypernuclei @xmath2 ground states is sizable , @xmath3  kev , and of opposite sign to that induced by the coulomb repulsion in light hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> recent _ ab initio _ calculations of the ( , ) mirror hypernuclei @xmath4 and @xmath5 levels have demonstrated that a @xmath6 mixing csb model due to dalitz and von hippel ( 1964 ) is capable of reproducing this large value of @xmath7 . these calculations are discussed here with emphasis placed on the leading - order chiral eft hyperon - nucleon bonn - jlich strong - interaction potential model used and the no - core shell - model calculational scheme applied . </S>",
