[ sec : intro ] , the goal of this work is to introduce a new method to search for high redshift ( @xmath9 ) mpc - scale overdensities on the basis of photometric redshifts only . we primarily introduce the method in order to search for groups and clusters in the cosmos field @xcite around the fr  i radio galaxies in the c09 sample . due to the cosmos multiwavelength coverage , increasingly accurate photometric redshift determinations",
    "have been derived @xcite .",
    "our method is tailored to the specific properties of both the sample and the survey adopted , but it can be also applied to other multiwavelength surveys and samples , if accurate photometric redshift information is available .    furthermore , the method requires the projected coordinates of fiducial beacons ( e.g. in our project we adopt the sample of @xmath34 radio galaxies ) .",
    "this implies that our method relies on a positional prior , i.e. it is introduced to search for a cluster or group environment around assigned locations in the projected sky .",
    "therefore , it is not properly a method to search blindly for clusters and groups within a given survey , even if it can be possibly applied for such purposes .",
    "this strategy is similar to that adopted in @xcite , who associated galaxies with previously selected groups and that adopted in @xcite who searched for clusters around the bcgs .    in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the problems that affect methods that search for high redshift clusters on the basis of number densities , with particular attention to those that use photometric redshifts .",
    "then , we focus on the peculiarities of our sample and the resulting need for introducing a new method to search for high redshift mpc - scale overdensities .    1 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , methods that identify high redshift structures on the basis of the observed surface densities have to discriminate galaxies at different redshifts , to avoid projection effects .",
    "as noted in @xcite , galaxy number counts are more susceptible to projection effects than , for example , the detection of x - ray emission from the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this makes problematic the identification of the structures at different distances along the line of sight .",
    "2 .   number densities are increasingly small for increasing redshifts , at @xmath9 .",
    "this affects also the deepest sky surveys .",
    "for example , the cosmos field survey has , on averages , number densities per unit redshift of @xmath2325 , 10 , and 3 counts  arcmin@xmath40  dz@xmath41 at redshift @xmath421 , 1.5 , and 2.0 , respectively @xcite , where only those galaxies with @xmath43 ab magnitudes in the range @xmath44 are considered .",
    "these low number counts imply that shot - noise strongly affects any @xmath34 cluster search based on galaxy number counts and photometric redshifts , since mpc - scale overdensities are extended and detected over scales of @xmath231  arcmin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typical of those of cluster cores .",
    "in fact , 1  arcmin corresponds to @xmath45  kpc at @xmath38 .",
    "typical statistical photometric redshift uncertainties are @xmath46 at redshifts @xmath34 .",
    "this applies to surveys such as cosmos @xcite and cfhtls @xcite .",
    "note that a distance of @xmath47 along the line of sight corresponds to more than 100  mpc , which is significantly more than the typical size of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "therefore , these uncertainties highly affect the line of sight discrimination of real cluster members from the foreground and any attempts to determine cluster membership on the basis of photometric redshifts only .",
    "+ furthermore , the typical statistical photometric redshift uncertainty increases within the redshift interval of our interest and undergoes a catastrophic failure at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in fact , photometric and spectroscopic redshift information can not be easily obtained between @xmath34 because most of the relevant spectral features fall outside of the instrumental wavelength bands in that redshift range , which is therefore called _ redshift desert _ @xcite .",
    "4 .   mpc - scale overdensities might undergo significant evolution between @xmath34 .",
    "their structure and number density might significantly change with cosmic time .",
    "in fact , diffuse protoclusters with star - forming galaxies have been in fact found at redshifts higher than @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "methods that search for high redshift groups or galaxy clusters that are based on optical number counts and photometric redshifts have to carefully identify the different mpc - scale structures that are present along the line of sight , in order to avoid projection effects .",
    "most of the existing methods such as those that are based on wavelets , friend - of - friends algorithms , peak finding methods , delaunay , voronoi tessellations , adaptive kernel ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that search for high redshift clusters on the basis of number counts and redshifts are very efficient at @xmath49 , but show reduced efficiency at higher redshifts because of the above mentioned problems .",
    "all these methods are based on the 2-d surface density more than on the 3-d number density . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "considering the 3-d number density would require a more accurate photometric redshift information .",
    "all the above mentioned methods characterize the projected space with a high accuracy , in order to identify mpc - scale structures of different scales .",
    "however , such a detailed multi - scale projected space analysis implies that involves establishing whether multiple overdensity peaks in the 2-d projected density field are part of a single larger structure in practice becomes extremely difficult and subjective @xcite .",
    "for this reason , previous studies are not always able to provide galaxy cluster and group candidate catalogs @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will introduce a less sophisticated but flexible method to overcome to these limitations .",
    "furthermore , high photometric redshift uncertainties do not allow us to consider the 3-d number density .",
    "therefore , we consider the 2-d surface density and the redshift information separately . in order to overcome the problems listed above , a detailed distance discrimination based on photometric redshifts",
    "is therefore required . as we show in the following this",
    "can be achieved to the detriment of a less detailed tessellation of the projected space .",
    "our method is based on galaxy number counts and photometric redshifts .",
    "it consists in searching for a dense environment around a given location in the sky .",
    "concerning our specific goal to search for cluster environments around the fr  is in the c09 sample , we will adopt the photometric redshift information for the galaxies in the cosmos field as given in the @xcite catalog . limiting the sample to",
    "only fr  is , we consider their recently estimated photometric redshifts from @xcite , when spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos - bright @xcite and magellan @xcite catalogs are not available ( see also paper  ii ) .",
    "note that this applies to any catalog and dataset with characteristics similar to the those we adopted .",
    "the poisson probability method ( ppm ) , is adapted from that proposed by @xcite to search for x - ray emitting substructures within clusters .",
    "the authors note how their method naturally overcomes the inconvenience of dealing with low number counts per pixel ( @xmath50 ) , which prevents them from applying the standard techniques based on @xmath51-fitting , e.g. @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "we are similarly dealing with the problem of small number counts .",
    "therefore standard methods might not be appropriate , as discussed above .",
    "we refer to appendix [ app : ppm ] for a comprehensive description of the ppm . here",
    "we briefly summarize the basic steps of the procedure :    * we tessellate the projected space with a circle centered at the coordinates of the beacon and a number of consecutive adjacent annuli .",
    "the regions are concentric and have the same area ( 2.18  arcmin@xmath52 ) . * for each region , we count galaxies with photometric redshifts within a given interval @xmath53 centered at the centroid redshift @xmath54 , for different values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 densely span between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "* for each area and for a given redshift bin we calculate the probability of the null hypothesis ( i.e. no clustering ) to have more than the observed number of galaxies , assuming poisson statistics and the average number density estimated from the cosmos field . starting from the coordinates of the beacon we select only the first consecutive overdense regions for which the probability of the null hypothesis is @xmath57 .",
    "we merge the selected regions and we compute the probability , separately , as done for each of them .",
    "we estimate the detection significance of the number count excess as the complementary probability .",
    "we do not consider overdensities that start to be detected at @xmath58  arcsec , corresponding to @xmath59  mpc , from the location of the beacon . * in figure",
    "[ fig : ppm_plots ] we report the ppm plots for the fields of some of the sources in the @xcite sample . for each choice of the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath53",
    "we plot the detection significance defined in the previous step .",
    "we adopt the following color code : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 points are plotted in cyan , blue , and red , respectively .",
    "we do not plot @xmath63 points .",
    "the abscissa of the vertical solid line is at the redshift of corresponding source .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the redshift uncertainties as given in b13 .",
    "we apply a gaussian filter to eliminate high frequency noisy patterns .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppm_plots ] shows the plot where the filter is applied .",
    "* we define as overdensities only those regions in the filtered plot for which consecutive @xmath60 points are present in a region of the ppm plot at least @xmath64 long on the redshift axis @xmath54 and defined within a tiny @xmath65 wide interval centered at @xmath66 .",
    "these values are chosen because of the properties of the errors of the photometric redshifts of our sample and of the size of the gaussian filter we apply .",
    "in particular the redshift bin ( @xmath66 ) corresponds to the estimated statistical 2-@xmath4 photometric redshift uncertainty at @xmath67 for dim galaxies ( i.e. with ab magnitude @xmath68 , * ? ? ?",
    "these magnitudes are typical of the galaxies we expect to find in clusters in the redshift range of our interest .",
    "we verified that the results are stable with respect to a sightly different choice of the redshift bin @xmath53 . * in order to estimate the actual significance of each mpc - scale overdensity we apply the same procedure outlined in the previous step , but progressively increasing the significance threshold until no overdensity is found .",
    "we assign to each overdensity a significance equal to the maximum significance threshold at which the overdensity is still detected .",
    "note that in case the overdensity displays multiple local peaks we do not exclude the lower significance ones .",
    "* we estimate the redshift of each overdensity as the centroid redshift @xmath54 at which the overdensity is selected in the ppm plot .",
    "* we also estimate the size of each overdensity in terms of the minimum and maximum distances from the fr  i beacon at which the overdensity is detected . in order to do",
    "so we consider all the points in the ppm plot within the region centered around @xmath66 and at least @xmath64 long on the redshift axis @xmath54 which defines the overdensity .",
    "for each of these points the overdensity is detected within certain minimum and maximum distances .",
    "we estimate the minimum and maximum distances of the overdensity as the average ( and the median ) of the minimum and maximum distances associated with all of these points , respectively .",
    "we also compute the rms dispersion of the distances as an estimate for the uncertainty . * in order to estimate the fiducial uncertainty for the redshift of the overdensity we consider all sources located between the median value of the minimum distance and the median value of the maximum distance from the coordinates of the source within which the overdensity is detected in the projected space .",
    "we also limit our analysis to the sources that have photometric redshifts within a redshift bin @xmath66 centered at the estimated redshift of the overdensity .",
    "this value is chosen to ensure consistency with the value used for our detection procedure ( see above ) .",
    "we estimate the overdensity redshift uncertainty as the rms dispersion around the average of the photometric redshifts of the sources that are selected in the field of the radio galaxy .",
    "* we associate with each radio galaxy any overdensity in its field that is located at a redshift compatible to that of the radio source itself ( see appendix  [ app : ppm ] ) .",
    "note that multiple overdensity associations are not excluded .",
    "our approach implicitly assumes azimuthal symmetry around the axis oriented at the coordinates of the beacon .",
    "since we extend the tessellation up to @xmath236  arcmin ( i.e. @xmath233  mpc at @xmath24 ) from the coordinates of the beacon , we do not exclude the possibility of detecting non circularly symmetric systems .",

    "the method we describe in the following is tailored to the specific properties of the sample and dataset used , to which we refer throughout the method description .",
    "more specifically , the ppm has been introduced to search for cluster candidates around @xmath34 fr  is selected in the cosmos field @xcite by @xcite .",
    "we also use photometric redshifts from the @xcite catalog .",
    "the ppm is based on photometric redshifts and galaxy number counts . similarly to other methods that use photometric redshift information ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider the redshift information and the coordinates in the projected space separately .",
    "this is because the photometric redshift uncertainties are much larger than the typical scale of clusters .",
    "therefore , such uncertainties are significantly dominant with respect to any other observable uncertainty ( e.g. , flux uncertainties , projected space coordinate uncertainties ) . in the following we will focus first on the projected space and then on the redshifts .      we tessellate the projected space with a circle centered at the coordinates of the beacon ( in our specific case this is the location of the fr  i radio galaxy ) and 49 consecutive adjacent annuli .",
    "these regions are concentric and have the same area , i.e. 2.18  arcmin@xmath52 .",
    "this is done in order to have the same average field density for each of the regions .",
    "the inner radius of the @xmath132-th annulus is equal to @xmath133 \\simeq 50\\times\\sqrt{i}$ ]  arcsec .",
    "this means that the radius of the circle centered at the coordinates of the beacon is equal to 50  arcsec .",
    "such an angular separation is consistent with that adopted by previous work focused on high-@xmath18 clusters ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "in fact , it corresponds to 427  kpc at redshift @xmath24 , that is typical of the cluster core size at redshift @xmath0 . if we chose a smaller scale we would be highly affected by shot noise .",
    "in fact , on average , for a fixed area of 2.18  arcmin@xmath52 , the differential number counts ( @xmath134 ) per unit redshift in the cosmos field are quite small and equal to @xmath135 , 22 , and 7 , at redshifts @xmath74 , 1.5 , and 2.0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "conversely , if we chose a greater scale we would characterize the cluster environment of the fr  is in our sample with a rough ( mpc - scale ) accuracy only .    in general , due the specific tessellation of the ppm ,",
    "the method is effective to detect mpc - scale rich groups and clusters ( as also discussed in paper  ii ) .",
    "conversely , it might be less efficient in finding poor groups and larger , i.e. a few mpc - scale , diffuse structures . therefore , a more detailed treatment of the projected space typical of sophisticated tessellations such as voronoi , delaunay ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) correlation estimators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wavelet analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , filter techniques , and adaptive kernels ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be ineffective and difficult to apply for cluster searches with the use of photometric redshifts only ( see also * ? ? ? * for further discussion ) .",
    "on the other hand , such methods might be more useful to study spectroscopically confirmed clusters or groups ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the typical size inspected by our tessellation changes at most @xmath136 within the entire redshift range of our interest . in fact , 1  arcmin corresponds to a physical size of 482 , 512 , and 509  kpc , at redshift @xmath73 , 1.5 , and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "depending on the adopted cosmology , the angular distance assumes a maximum between @xmath34 .",
    "these considerations imply that our tessellation is effective to characterize mpc - scale overdensities with the required accuracy , independently of redshift , under the assumption that cluster core size does not dramatically change for increasing redshifts .",
    "furthermore , our approach implicitly assumes azimuthal symmetry around the axis oriented at the coordinates of the beacon .",
    "we do not exclude the possibility to detect non circularly symmetric systems , since we extend the tessellation up to @xmath236  arcmin ( i.e. @xmath233  mpc at @xmath24 ) from the coordinates of the beacon @xcite .",
    "moreover , our method is also flexible enough to find clusters even if the coordinates of the cluster center are known within @xmath69  arcsec only ( as tested with simulations in sect .  [",
    "sec : increasing_offset ] ) .    however , we note that the great majority of of low - power radio sources in clusters or groups are found within @xmath70  kpc from the core center up to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "therefore , this suggests that low - power radio galaxies in cluster environments are preferentially hosted within the central regions of the core , at least at low or intermediate redshifts .",
    "the results presented in the companion paper ( see discussion in sect .  7.10 of paper  ii ) for the @xmath34 cluster candidates within the @xcite sample suggest that this is generally true also at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , all these results support the specific projected space tessellation method described in this section and adopted for our cluster search .      as discussed in @xcite , identifying large scale structures on the basis of 2-d number densities requires a careful selection of those galaxies that are at the redshift of the structure .",
    "this is because , especially in the case of high-@xmath18 clusters , foreground galaxies contaminate the field . despite this",
    ", the contamination from foreground sources is limited by the smaller angular size of high-@xmath18 clusters with respect to that of those at lower redshifts .    as pointed out in @xcite , three different criteria are commonly adopted to discriminate among the galaxies at different distances by using ( i ) color selections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the method is tailored to the specific properties of the @xmath34 fr  i radio galaxy sample we consider @xcite , selected within the cosmos survey @xcite , and to the specific dataset used .",
    "the poisson probability method ( ppm ) , is adapted from the method proposed by @xcite to search for x - ray emitting substructures within clusters in the low number count regime .",
    "here we are similarly dealing with the problem of small number densities .",
    "we test the efficiency of the ppm in searching for cluster candidates against simulations .",
    "two different approaches are adopted .",
    "i ) we use two @xmath0 x - ray detected clusters found in the cosmos survey within the @xcite catalog .",
    "we shift them to higher redshift up to @xmath39 .",
    "we find that the ppm detects both clusters up to @xmath24 and it correctly estimates both the redshift and the size of the two clusters .",
    "ii ) we simulate spherically symmetric clusters of different size and richness , and we locate them at different redshifts ( i.e. @xmath3 , 1.5 , and 2.0 ) in the cosmos field . we find that the ppm detects the simulated clusters within the entire redshift range considered with a statistical 1@xmath4 redshift accuracy of @xmath5 .",
    "this is remarkably comparable to the statistical photometric redshift uncertainty of photometric redshift catalogs over the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that almost all of our simulated clusters are detected . compact clusters ( i.e. 1  mpc comoving size ) and rich clusters",
    "are more easily detected than lower richness clusters , when the cluster center coordinates are accurately known .",
    "the majority of these clusters are also detected even if the coordinates of the cluster center are known with poor accuracy of @xmath69  arcsec .",
    "furthermore , poor overdensities and clusters of intermediate richness are more difficult to detect in the case where the cluster coordinates are known with an accuracy of @xmath23100  arcsec .",
    "concerning cluster sizes , we found that the ppm provides estimates with a 33@xmath130 rms fractional accuracy , if the cluster center coordinates are known .",
    "we applied the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to the cumulative number distributions of galaxies in the fields of the @xcite sample similarly to what done by previous work on cosmos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we checked that the ks test is ineffective in dealing with these types of cluster searches and the results are not conclusive .",
    "this is because shot noise fluctuations affect the results of the ks test .",
    "we found that our method is effective in finding clusters up to high redshift .",
    "we believe that the ppm is a valuable alternative to previously considered methods to search for high - redshift clusters based on photometric redshifts .",
    "in fact , with the inclusion of a solid positional prior and an accurate redshift sampling we overcome , at least in part , the problem of establishing whether multiple overdensity peaks in the 2-d projected density field are part of a single larger structure @xcite and , thus , identifying different structures at different redshifts .",
    "although the ppm is primarily introduced for the cosmos survey ( see paper  ii ) , it may be applied to wide field surveys to blindly search for cluster candidates .",
    "accurate photometric redshifts and a survey depth similar or better than that of cosmos ( e.g. i@xmath6 ) are required .    however , our method is less effective for those surveys that will provide sufficient spectroscopic redshift information , where standard 3-d methods such as correlation functions might be more successfully applied .",
    "conversely , the ppm might be also applied to sdss stripe 82 and future wide field surveys such as lsst and euclid that will provide accurate photometric redshift information .",
    "another possible use of the ppm is a search for ( proto-)clusters at @xmath131 , by adopting radio galaxies or other sources such as lyman break galaxies as beacons .",
    "the method described here detects mpc - scale overdensities within the entire redshift range spanned by the @xmath54 values .",
    "then , we associate with the radio galaxy , only those overdensities that are detected in the field , at a redshift compatible with that of the source , i.e. when the interval centered at the redshift estimated for the overdensity and with a half - width equal to 2 times the fiducial redshift error intersects the redshift range defined within the radio galaxy redshift uncertainties .",
    "multiple overdensity associations are not excluded .",
    "we point out that the redshift of the fr  i beacon is considered only during the last step of the method procedure , when we perform the association between the detected overdensities and the radio galaxy .",
    "this is primarily motivated by the fact that we do not have spectroscopic information for most of our fr  is .",
    "therefore , our approach is necessarily different from previous studies which select cluster members using photometric redshifts for the majority of the galaxies in the field , but also knowing the spectroscopic redshifts of some of the cluster members ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , our choice implies that the high significance patterns in our plots ( see e.g. figure  [ fig : ppmplots_filter_before_and_after ] ) have a typical width along the @xmath54 axis comparable to the statistical photometric redshift uncertainty @xmath277 .",
    "such an uncertainty corresponds to sources with @xmath99 and @xmath100 sources ( see table  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we expect to find in our clusters .",
    "therefore , our method estimates the cluster redshifts with similar accuracy . on the other hand , including the ( photometric ) redshift information of the fr  i beacon from the beginning of our procedure would imply an increasing of the intrinsic scatter due to the fr  i redshift uncertainty . if we sum in quadrature the redshift uncertainty associated with each fr  i to the statistical photometric redshift uncertainty @xmath46 , the uncertainty increases up to @xmath278 , depending on the redshift of the radio galaxy and its uncertainty .",
    "this effect would make our method ineffective to search for high-@xmath18 cluster candidates around radio galaxies .      in this section",
    "we describe how the ppm can be generalized for its application to other datasets and photometric redshift catalogs , whose statistically redshift accuracy is possibly comparable or better than that of the @xcite catalog .",
    "surveys with a similar or higher depth than that of cosmos are preferred . in particular , the ppm might be applied to both present and future wide field surveys such as sdss stripe 82 , lsst , and euclid .",
    "the parameters should be adapted to take into account the different mean field number density of galaxies in the survey and the statistical photometric redshift uncertainties of the redshift catalog .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to provide precise rules .    in general , the redshift bin @xmath53",
    "at which the overdensities are evaluated in the ppm plots should be set equal to the 2-@xmath4 statistical photometric redshift uncertainty of the galaxies at the redshifts of our interest and magnitudes typical of the sources we expect to find in clusters at high redshifts .",
    "consequently the length of the @xmath268-intervals should be at least about one - third of the specific redshift bin @xmath53 adopted to select the overdensities in the ppm plots .",
    "we remind that the @xmath268-intervals are the high significance intervals in the ppm plots ( at the specific @xmath53 ) that are associated with overdense regions .",
    "similarly , the gaussian dispersion @xmath220 used to remove the noise from the ppm plots should be equal to one - fifth of the above mentioned minimum length for the @xmath268-interval . as described and motivated in the procedure description ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : peak_finding_alg ] ) when defining the @xmath268-intervals , consecutive intervals that are separated by an amount @xmath220 ( @xmath279 in this paper ) or less along the @xmath54 axis should be always merged .",
    "such scaling relations are motivated by the fact that the adopted parameters should ultimately rescale linearly with the typical statistical photometric redshift accuracy .",
    "furthermore , according to the procedure description we do not change the ppm tessellation with increasing cluster redshift .",
    "this is mainly because we are looking for overdense regions with sizes typical of those of the cluster cores and the angular distance @xmath280 at the redshift @xmath18 is fairly constant between @xmath34 .",
    "however , it might be appropriate to rescale linearly the size of the ppm tessellation by a factor of @xmath281 in the case where the ppm is used to search for diffuse proto - clusters at redshifts significantly higher than @xmath34 ( e.g. , at @xmath282 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this leads to a correction @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 at redshifts @xmath286 , @xmath287 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "<S> we describe a new method ( poisson probability method , ppm ) to search for high redshift galaxy clusters and groups by using photometric redshift information and galaxy number counts . </S>",
    "<S> the method relies on poisson statistics and is primarily introduced to search for mpc - scale environments around a specific beacon . </S>",
    "<S> the ppm is tailored to both the properties of the fr  i radio galaxies in the @xcite sample , that are selected within the cosmos survey , and on the specific dataset used . </S>",
    "<S> we test the efficiency of our method of searching for cluster candidates against simulations . </S>",
    "<S> two different approaches are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> i ) we use two @xmath0 x - ray detected cluster candidates found in the cosmos survey and we shift them to higher redshift up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ppm detects the cluster candidates up to @xmath2 , and it correctly estimates both the redshift and size of the two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) we simulate spherically symmetric clusters of different size and richness , and we locate them at different redshifts ( i.e. @xmath3  , 1.5 , and 2.0 ) in the cosmos field . we find that the ppm detects the simulated clusters within the considered redshift range with a statistical 1-@xmath4 redshift accuracy of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ppm is an efficient alternative method for high - redshift cluster searches that may also be applied to both present and future wide field surveys such as sdss stripe 82 , lsst , and euclid . </S>",
    "<S> accurate photometric redshifts and a survey depth similar or better than that of cosmos ( e.g. i@xmath6 ) are required . </S>"
