    "quantum optics is governed by rules imposed by commutation relations which have to be kept during time evolution .",
    "optical amplification is no exception to this story .",
    "typically , the amplified output is suffered from inevitable excess noise .",
    "this limitation is quantum - mechanically imposed , thus does not depend on the specific realization methods .",
    "caves classified general linear amplification into phase - insensitive amplification ( pia ) and phase - sensitive amplification ( psa )  @xcite .",
    "he also systematically derived the quantum limit of excess noise for such general linear amplification with arbitrary gain from the requirement to preserve commutation relations .",
    "this excess noise originates from quantum fluctuations in the auxiliary system required to keep energy conservation .",
    "we concentrate on pia , supposing the target of amplification to be optical wave amplitude of a single mode , which is denoted by the term `` signal '' .",
    "classical counterpart of pia is a conversion of arbitrary complex wave amplitude @xmath1 into @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gain of amplification .",
    "as is found in ordinary textbooks , annihilation operators in quantum optics correspond to complex amplitudes in classical optics .",
    "therefore , we describe the amplifying process by the transformation of annihilation operators .",
    "quantum - mechanically optimal pia in the sense that the excess noise is minimized can be achieved by the following transformation  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the signal mode s annihilation operators before and after the amplification , respectively .",
    "there is an extra term @xmath7 which is introduced in order to meet the commutation relation of @xmath8=1 $ ] for both the input and output signal modes .",
    "here , @xmath9 is an arbitrary phase factor , and @xmath10 is another mode s annihilation operator in the auxiliary system . throughout this paper , the ancilla mode represented by @xmath10",
    "is denoted by the term `` idler '' and distinguished from other ancilla modes .",
    ".   becomes the input - output relation of optimal pia when the idler is in a vacuum state .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of the idler contaminates the amplified signal .",
    "this is the inevitable excess noise of pia .",
    "note that this penalty prevents amplification from being a loophole of the uncertainty relation in joint measurements  @xcite . at the limit of high - gain amplification",
    ", we can see the famous @xmath11  db cost of the noise figure for pia of coherent states .",
    "in addition to this intrinsic excess noise , further nonintrinsic excess noise may be caused by other ancilla modes in nonoptimal pia .",
    "there are numerous practical realizations of optical amplification .",
    "doped fiber amplifiers ( dfas ) and semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soas ) utilize stimulated emissions  @xcite , and raman amplifiers ( ras ) and optical parametric amplifiers ( opas ) utilize nonlinear optical effects . in principle , there is no quantum - mechanical reason to prevent these realizations from achieving the optimal pia in the form of eq .  .",
    "however , the real devices with current technology are accompanied by further excess noises .",
    "recently , pia operating almost at the optimal level is experimentally demonstrated by josse _",
    "et al . _ by utilizing feedforward  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the high efficiency of josse s pia is that it does not require inefficient nonclassical operations or nonclassical ancillas .",
    "it uses a vacuum state as an ancilla which is present everywhere , and linear optics and homodyne measurements followed by feedforward which are highly efficient .",
    "although josse s pia is a good attainment , it is not the end of the story . the signal transformation in eq .",
    "is an irreversible thermalizing process .",
    "complete pia should have _ unitary _ realization on an expanded hilbert space . in order to unitarize pia",
    ", two - mode description is sufficient .",
    "the full input - output relation becomes as follows :    [ eq : piaunitary ] @xmath12    note that the roles of the signal and idler are symmetric in this relation .",
    "the significance of unitarization must be the reversibility .",
    "the inverse transformation is easily derived when we take notice of the fact that eq .",
    "is equivalent to two - mode squeezing operation .",
    "a two - mode squeezing operation parametrized by @xmath13 is canceled by another two - mode squeezing operation where the squeezing direction is opposite , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , in many amplification schemes including josse s experimental demonstration  @xcite , the idler output is lost in the inextractable environment , making the process irreversible .    in order to realize idler - preserving and close - to - optimal pia",
    ", we require some nonclassicality for the amplifier .",
    "this is contrastive to josse s idler - nonpreserving pia which does not require any nonclassicality .",
    "a typical strategy to introduce nonclassicality into feedforward - based quantum circuits is to use nonclassical states as ancillas .",
    "continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum teleportation  @xcite and cv error correction  @xcite are good examples . in these examples ,",
    "squeezed states are used as ancillas that support the performance beyond the classical limit , and the complex operations after the state preparation stage are efficiently implemented by linear optics .    in this paper , by employing the feedforward - based scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrate pia of coherent states which preserve the idler output .",
    "the scheme basically relies on linear optics including homodyne measurements and feedforward .",
    "squeezed vacuum states are used as ancillas , which inject nonclassicality into our pia . only for generating the nonclassical ancilla states , we resort to nonlinear optical effects .",
    "our demonstration is for the amplification gain of @xmath0 , which is tuned via passive optical devices and feedforward electric circuits .",
    "combining pia for @xmath0 with a half beamsplitter , we also demonstrate @xmath15 approximate cloning of coherent states , where an `` anticlone '' remains at the output .",
    "( anticlone will be explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : clone ] . ) in principle , our amplifier and cloner becomes quantum - mechanically optimum at the limit of infinite squeezing of the ancillas .",
    "for the case of finite squeezing , as is the real situation in experiments , further excess noise invades in accordance to the level of the squeezing .",
    "however , the degradation is small enough to retain nonclassical features .",
    "the behaviors of our amplifier and cloner are fully characterized by using several coherent states as inputs .",
    "furthermore , we also pay much attention to the output correlations , because nonclassical properties clearly appear in them . for the pia experiment",
    ", we check the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation between the signal and idler outputs . for the cloning experiment",
    ", we check bipartite entanglement between each clone and the anticlone , which as a whole proves tripartite entanglement of class i  @xcite . moreover , for both experiments , the reversibility is investigated from the output correlations .",
    "our idler - preserving pia is significant in several respects .",
    "first of all , the reversibility will pave the way to new schemes .",
    "recently , there is a proposal of a cv quantum interface that enables in principle a unit fidelity of transfer using such reversible pia  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the reversibility in cloning is also advantageous .",
    "cloning of unknown states is distribution of information , and its reversibility reserves the option to recover the distributed fragments of the information .",
    "this will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : clone ] .",
    "secondly , our pia would have some applications as two - mode squeezing operation .",
    "note that one - mode squeezing operation is already demonstrated successfully in ref .",
    "@xcite with similar approach .    in this introduction",
    ", pia has been described together with a brief historical review .",
    "especially , the nonclassical property of pia is discussed , which is obscure in many amplification processes because the idler output is lost in the inextractable environment .",
    "the subsequent contents of this paper are as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ffpia ] , feedforward - based pia is described , explicitly showing the excess noise due to finite squeezing of ancillas . in sec .",
    "[ sec : clone ] , cv quantum state cloning and its connection with pia are described . in sec .  [",

    "sec : resultsclone ] , the experimental results for @xmath15 approximate cloning of coherent states are shown . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , our experimental achievements are summarized .",
    "in our definition , feedforward means that the operations after some measurements are changed depending on the measurement outcomes which in general are obtained randomly . in particular , in this paper it indicates phase space displacement operations whose amounts are proportional to the results of homodyne measurements .",
    "we know two specific schemes for feedforward - based pia that preserves the idler at the output . one scheme is proposed by filip _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which pia is composed of two feedforward - based single - mode squeezers proposed in the same paper .",
    "the other scheme is proposed by josse _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite as a modification of the idler - nonpreserving pia .",
    "note that josse s idler - preserving pia is just a theoretical proposal and the idler - nonpreserving pia alone is experimentally demonstrated .",
    "both of filip s scheme and josse s scheme rely on linear optics including homodyne measurements and feedforward , and require offline - prepared nonclassical states as ancillas . moreover , in both schemes , the gain of amplification is accurately and stably determined via the choice of passive optical devices and correspondingly feedforward gains . as for the nonclassical ancillas , filip s scheme requires two single - mode squeezed states , on the other hand",
    ", josse s scheme requires a two - mode squeezed state .",
    "since two single - mode squeezed states can be converted to a two - mode squeezed state and vice versa by a half beamsplitter interaction , the amounts of the nonclassical resources required for the two distinct schemes are the same .    for both schemes ,",
    "the feedforward - based pia coincides with the quantum - mechanically optimal pia only at the limit of infinite squeezing of the ancillas . for the case of finite squeezing , excess noise contaminates the output to some extent .",
    "note that this is a common matter of feedforward - based cv deterministic processing  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two schemes proposed by filip and josse solely arises in this excess noise . for filip s scheme",
    ", it appears symmetrically in the signal and idler outputs . on the other hand , for josse s scheme",
    ", it appears only in the idler output .",
    "the better choice between different schemes depends on the specific application .",
    "we have chosen the symmetrical one . in the demonstration in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultspia ] , we confirm the symmetry of pia by swapping the roles of the signal and idler .",
    "[ sfig : ampschematic ] shows the schematic of our pia , from which the symmetry of the signal and idler is obvious .",
    "its details will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "here we give the input - output relation . in the following , the quadrature phase amplitudes of each optical mode",
    "are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the mode s annihilation operator @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath20 in eq .   can be arbitrarily changed by pre- and post - processing of phase rotation of the idler .",
    "therefore , we consider the case of @xmath21 without loss of generality",
    ". explicitly showing the excess noise coming from finitely squeezed ancillas , the input - output relation becomes as follows  @xcite :    @xmath22    the subscripts ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' represent the two main modes .",
    "they correspond to the signal and idler , though we do not specify which is which because the relation is symmetric . @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "denote the squeezed quadratures of the two ancilla modes . at the limit of infinite",
    "squeezing , these terms vanish , and the transformation above strictly coincides with the optimal pia . the amplification gain @xmath25 is determined via one parameter @xmath26 , which is a common reflectivity of two beamsplitters and in fig .",
    "[ sfig : ampschematic ] , with the relation of @xmath27 one - to - one correspondence of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is easily checked .",
    "note that the feedforward gain is also parameterized by @xmath26 .",
    "it is chosen so that the antisqueezed noises from the ancillas are canceled out at the output .",
    "for the demonstration of @xmath30 , the value of @xmath26 should be chosen as @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting input - output relation becomes as follows :    [ eq : in - out_g2 ] @xmath32",
    "it is known as the no - cloning theorem that an unknown quantum state @xmath33 can not be perfectly duplicated as @xmath34  @xcite . however , approximate cloning is possible , which can go beyond some classical limit in general .    in this section",
    ", we will discuss cv cloning , and make its connection with pia .",
    "furthermore , its reversibility is discussed by introducing the notion of anticlone . in general",
    ", cloning can be described as a unitary operation supported by ancilla systems .",
    "the ancilla output system generally depends on the cloned state , from which anticlones are obtained .",
    "we show the equations for @xmath15 cloning , which corresponds to the experimental demonstration in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsclone ] .",
    "however , pia allows general @xmath35 cloning in principle , which will be described in appendix  [ sec : gencln ] .",
    "here , the notation @xmath35 means that @xmath36 clones are created from @xmath37 identical originals .",
    "first , we would like to say that pragmatic cloning for cv is not the universal cloning  @xcite with respect to the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , because it is an unnatural situation that all the states in the noncompact space appears with equal probability . in general , the choice of the appropriate cloner depends on how the information is embedded in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the typical situation is that the cv information is embedded as a displacement on some quantum state @xmath33 . here",
    ", @xmath33 , which we refer to as a core state , is either known or unknown .",
    "then , the set of possible original states is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 $ ] is the displacement operator . [ the probability density @xmath40 is omitted because we consider for simplicity the case where @xmath41 is uniformly distributed . ] as a special case of this , the set @xmath42 becomes all coherent states when the core state @xmath33 is known to be a vacuum state .",
    "this way of embedding is found in ordinary cv quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols  @xcite .    for such protocols ,",
    "the role of cloning is distribution of the information , rather than duplication of a quantum state .",
    "therefore , the measure of the cloning precision should be related to the estimation of @xmath41 , instead of the traditional fidelity .",
    "furthermore , asymmetric cloner is significant as well as symmetric cloner",
    ". arbitrary share ratio of the information is achieved by cloner with tunable asymmetry .",
    "we suppose a simple picture of cloning where some noise is added to the original state as the penalty of cloning . then , the quality of cloning is totally determined by this noise . for simplicity ,",
    "we impose rotational symmetry on the noise added to each clone .",
    "this is naturally justified when the core state @xmath33 is either known to be symmetric or unknown .",
    "the added noise is characterized by its variance @xmath43  @xcite , where @xmath44 for @xmath15 cloning .",
    "note that @xmath45 corresponds to the mean photon number of thermalization in the clone .",
    "the variances @xmath45 are directly connected to the mean square errors in the estimation of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , a measure can be constructed from them .",
    "given the desired asymmetry , the cost function is determined  @xcite : @xmath46 the positive parameters @xmath47 determine the asymmetry .",
    "( @xmath48 corresponds to symmetric cloning . )",
    "the cloner that minimize the cost function is the optimal .",
    "it is obvious that the optimal cloner is gaussian when the cost function is set as a function of the noise variances as in eq .  .",
    "in order to minimize it , the ancillas that support cloning are chosen in minimum uncertainty states , which are gaussian .",
    "this contrasts with the evaluation by the fidelity .",
    "non - gaussian cloning can slightly go beyond the gaussian fidelity for coherent states  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the evaluation by the variances is more practical .",
    "it is pointed out that optimal attack in qkd is gaussian  @xcite .",
    "there is a restriction on the excess noises @xmath45 which is imposed by quantum mechanics  @xcite : @xmath49 the optimal cloner with respect to the cost function in eq .",
    "satisfies the equality in eq .   by necessity .",
    "this noise penalty comes from consistency with the uncertainty relation .",
    "the attainable information of the original state does not increase by cloning due to this noise . recall that the inevitable noise in pia comes from the same reason .",
    "indeed , the optimal cloner can be constructed from the optimal phase - insensitive amplifier and beamsplitters .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath15 cloning with arbitrary asymmetry is achieved by putting an amplifier in one of the arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer  @xcite . especially , for symmetric cloning , the reflectivity of the first beamsplitter becomes unity , i.e. , it is achieved by first amplifying the original with @xmath30 and then splitting the amplified signal in half .",
    "this procedure can be extended to @xmath35 cloning  @xcite .",
    "the optimality of this realization is proven with respect to the cost function in eq .",
    "@xcite .    for gaussian cloning of coherent states , the added noise variance @xmath45 and the fidelity @xmath50 have correspondence as @xmath51 .",
    "by using eq .  ,",
    "the upper limit of fidelity is obtained for arbitrarily asymmetric gaussian cloning . in particular ,",
    "it becomes @xmath52 for the symmetric case .",
    "this is significantly higher than the classical limit of @xmath53 , where we regard the limit of state estimation as the classical limit of symmetric cloning because the estimated state is classical information which can be copied any number of times .",
    "note that the sameness of state estimation and asymptotic cloning where the number of clones tends to infinity is proven for a general set @xmath42 of possible original states  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these fidelities only for the consistency with previous works .",
    "we stress again that our actual interest is the variances .",
    "we have seen above that the clones are made of the signal output of the amplifier .",
    "when cloning is unitarily realized , we still have the idler output , whose state is affected by the original state .",
    "now we pay attention to this ancilla output system .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning of this section , anticlones are byproducts of cloning which are obtained from the ancilla systems .",
    "especially , for @xmath15 cloning , the idler output itself is an anticlone .",
    "it is an approximation of the phase - conjugated original state , or in other words , the output of an approximate not gate .",
    "qubit version of this gate is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "anticlones are important when we are concerned with the reversibility .",
    "the originals can in principle be perfectly reproduced only when all the clones and anticlones are present . for the reversibility ,",
    "the essential resource is nonclassical correlations , or entanglement .",
    "conceptually , the excess noises in cloning is canceled by using the nonclassical correlations .",
    "therefore , we discuss the existence of entanglement in the three - mode output system of @xmath15 cloning .",
    "clones are obtained by splitting the amplified signal , thus there is no entanglement among clones .",
    "however , there is entanglement between each clone and the anticlone .",
    "we stress that the resource for the recovery is not the anticlones themselves but the entanglement .",
    "we can obtain anticlones without entanglement with clones as follows .",
    "suppose the situation where two independent cloners are running , and the same states are used as the inputs for them .",
    "then , the clones obtained from one cloner do not have entanglement with the anticlones from the other . in this case",
    ", the originals can not be recovered from the noncorrelated outputs .    for the recovery of the originals ,",
    "the inverse unitary operation is not required .",
    "the optimal cloning can be fully reversed by the bell measurement on a clone and an anticlone and subsequent feedforward to the remaining single clone  @xcite .",
    "note that this recovery scheme works not only for coherent states but also for an arbitrary core state @xmath33 .",
    "this scheme is efficient from two points of view .",
    "one is on a technical level that the homodyne measurements and feedforward displacement operations are quite efficient with current technology .",
    "the other is on a conceptual level that the performer of the bell measurement and the owner of the remaining clone who is willing to recover the original can be spatially separated .",
    "for this case , they only need classical channels for communication , and never quantum channels .",
    "note that even partial reversal is possible with a similar scheme based on local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , which converts , e.g. , symmetric clones to asymmetric clones  @xcite .",
    "we would like to discuss practical aspects of cloning and its reversibility assisted by classical communication . as described above , cloning of a quantum state",
    "is regarded as distribution of information among plural participants .",
    "the information of the original is to some extend accessible to individual participants .",
    "this situation is clearly distinguished from that found in usual quantum error correcting codes where the quantum information is mapped on a larger hilbert space so that no information about the original is accessible from a localized system .",
    "such share of information would play important roles in several scenarios , in which the reversibility would give a tactical aspect to information exchange .",
    "for example , cloning is a possible attack by an eavesdropper in qkd . in this example",
    ", the reversibility of cloning provides the opportunity for the communicators to negotiate with the eavesdropper when they know the attack  @xcite . since",
    "coherent states are a strong candidate for the information carrier in quantum communication , cloning of coherent states is especially of great significance .",
    "there are several experimental previous works which demonstrate cloning of coherent states beyond the classical limit of @xmath53 in non - reversible ways , i.e. , their anticlones are lost in the environment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using feedforward - based pia of ref .",

    ", there is no previous experiment of this kind even in qubit regime .",
    "although our demonstration is only for coherent states , our cloner should equally work for arbitrary core state @xmath33 as discussed above .",
    "we close this section by giving the input - output relation of the optimal @xmath15 symmetric cloning . by substituting @xmath30 and @xmath21 into the input - output relation in eq .   and splitting the signal output in half , we obtain ,    @xmath54    where the subscripts ` org ' , ` ' , ` ' , and ` ' denote the original , first clone , second clone , and anticlone , respectively .",

    ", we also demonstrated @xmath15 approximate cloning of coherent states , where the remaining idler output was interpreted as the anticlone .    for both experiments ,",
    "the full demonstration was given in the following sequence .",
    "first , we characterized the individual output modes . by treating the quadrature data directly ,",
    "they were visualized as phase space diagrams to help intuitive understanding .",
    "especially , the mirror image in the idler output or the anticlone is shown .",
    "then the input - output relation was examined more strictly by using several different coherent states as inputs .",
    "finally , the output correlations were examined .",
    "they are important because the nonclassical properties are only accessible via them .",
    "not only the ordinary epr correlations were shown , but also the possibility of the reverse operation was directly presented by appropriate measurements of the correlations .",
    "our results are a good demonstration that shows the properties of an amplification process , which have been theoretically known for decades but not fully demonstrated experimentally .",
    "especially , it is reversible when the idler is present .",
    "such reversible amplification is significant from practical respects , as is shown in refs .",
    "we did not demonstrate the reverse operation but showed its possibility from the correlations .",
    "the recovery of the signal state only requires the bell measurement and feedforward  @xcite , which would be much less lossy and noisy than implementing the inverse transformation .",
    "full and partial recovery of the distributed information via such a feedforward scheme is left for future experiments .",

    "in this appendix , the discussion in sec .  [ sec : clone ] is extended to @xmath35 cloning .",
    "the procedure of @xmath35 symmetric cloning can be decomposed into three steps as follows  @xcite .",
    "firstly , all the information of @xmath41 are put together into a single mode by a beamsplitter network . a state with larger amplitude @xmath135",
    "is created from the @xmath37 identical originals @xmath136 in this step .",
    "secondly , the combined signal is amplified with the gain @xmath137 .",
    "finally , the amplified signal is combined with @xmath138 ancillas by another beamsplitter network , creating @xmath36 clones . for asymmetric cloning ,",
    "the procedure is essentially the same , but the amplification in the second step is applied to a part of the combined signal , and the gain is changed correspondingly as @xmath139  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath140 anticlones are obtained from the idler output by combining it with @xmath141 ancillas by another beamsplitter network .",
    "therefore , as a whole , @xmath36 clones and @xmath140 anticlones are obtained , whose complex mean amplitudes are @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively , from @xmath37 originals with the complex mean amplitude of @xmath142 .",
    "it is evident that there is no entanglement among clones or anticlones , however , there is entanglement between a clone and an anticlone .",
    "the asymmetric clones have the following form : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the annihilation operator of the clone , @xmath146 is that of the combined original after the first step , @xmath147 is that of the idler input , and @xmath148 is that of the ancilla input for the latter beamsplitter network . the coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150 are not independent in order to preserve the commutation relations . by setting all the ancillas in vacuum states ,",
    "the added noises become rotationally symmetric and gaussian , and their variances correspond to the parameters @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "they satisfy the relation below  @xcite : @xmath151 the optimality of eq .",
    "is proven with respect to the cost function constructed from the variances  @xcite : @xmath152 in particular , for the symmetric cloning , i.e. , @xmath153 , eq .",
    "saturates the following inequality which is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the consistency with the uncertainty relation : @xmath154    the limit fidelity for symmetric gaussian cloning is calculated as @xmath155 . on the other hand , taking the limit that @xmath36 goes to infinity , the classical limit of cloning ( i.e. , the limit of state estimation ) is obtained as @xmath156 .",
    "as with @xmath15 cloning , optimal @xmath157 cloning can be fully reversed by @xmath138 bell measurements performed on each set of a clone and an anticlone and subsequent feedforward to the remaining single clone  @xcite . even with the smaller number of bell measurements , the original is partially recovered accordingly .",

    "more strictly speaking , the story becomes as follows : the simple picture of cloning that some noise is added to the original @xmath136 is valid for @xmath157 cloning , irrespective of the core state @xmath33 .",

    "when the core state is unknown , a part of the original quantum fluctuation is replaced by that of the ancillas , therefore , the added noises @xmath45 become ill - defined .",
