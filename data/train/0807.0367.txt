    "this paper is devoted to the exposition of an elementary subset of some recent results bearing on scattering theory for the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xmath0    in @xmath1 space dimensions , where @xmath2 is a complex valued function defined in space time @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real valued function of @xmath6 , typically a sum of powers @xmath7    with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also present a straightforward extension of those results to the hartree equation ( 1.1 ) with @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a real even function of the space variable and @xmath12 denotes the convolution in @xmath13 .",
    "the first main question of scattering theory is the existence of the wave operators , namely the construction of solutions that behave asymptotically in time as solutions of the free schrdinger equation , namely such that @xmath14    ( and the analogue for @xmath15 , where @xmath16    the second main question of scattering theory is asymptotic completeness ( ac ) , simply called `` scattering '' in some of the recent literature , and consists in proving that all solutions of the relevant equation , in a suitable functional framework , behave asympotically as solutions of the free schrdinger equation , namely satisfy ( 1.4 ) and the analogue for @xmath17 .",
    "of special interest is the case of finite energy solutions of ( 1.1 ) , namely of solutions in @xmath18 .",
    "an essential tool in the proof of ac for such solutions is the morawetz inequality , first derived for the nonlinear klein - gordon ( nlkg ) equation @xcite and then extended to the nls equation @xcite . that inequality was applied to prove ac first for the nlkg equation and then for the nls equation in space dimension @xmath19 in seminal papers by morawetz and strauss @xcite and by lin and strauss @xcite , for slightly more regular solutions .",
    "the case of general finite energy solutions in space dimension @xmath19 was treated later in @xcite for nls equations and in @xcite for hartree equations .",
    "the treatment was then improved for the nls equation in @xcite which covers in addition the more difficult cases @xmath20 , as well as the case of the nlkg equation , and for the hartree equation in @xcite .",
    "more recently , several groups of authors have studied the more difficult problem of extending some of the previous results , in particular the proof of existence of global solutions and the proof of ac ( `` scattering '' ) , on the one hand to the case of critical interactions , and on the other hand to the case of subenergy solutions , namely of solutions of intermediate regularity between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "an important tool in some of those works is a new version of the morawetz inequality , of a multilinear and in particular bilinear or quadratic type .",
    "that inequality has appeared in various forms in the literature and seems to have now stabilized to a simple form ( @xcite @xcite-@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite-@xcite and references therein quoted ) .",
    "leaving aside the difficult problems arising for critical interactions and/or for subenergy solutions , that new inequality provides a unified proof of ac for noncritical nls in the energy space for all space dimensions , as well as for the hartree equation for @xmath23 .",
    "that proof is much simpler than the previous ones .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an exposition of that new quadratic morawetz inequality and of its application to the proof of ac for the nls and hartree equations in the energy space in noncritical situations .",
    "that result for noncritical nls appears as a by product for @xmath24 in @xcite , for @xmath25 in @xcite and for @xmath19 in @xcite , which is mostly devoted to the critical cases . in section  2",
    ", we first derive the quadratic morawetz identity and we deduce therefrom the basic estimate that leads to the proof of ac .",
    "the formal proof of the identity is formulated in terms of conservation laws , in the spirit of @xcite . in section  3",
    ", we exploit the previous estimate to prove ac .",
    "we treat the case of the nls equation in some detail , and we give the modifications needed for the hartree equation .",
    "the result applies to @xmath21 supercritical and @xmath22 subcritical nonlinearities .",
    "some peripheral results are collected in appendices . in appendix  1",
    ", we give an estimate which points to the usefulness of the morawetz inequality at lower regularity levels than @xmath22 , in particular at the level of @xmath26 . in appendix  2",
    ", we exploit the point of view of conservation laws to derive a quadratic identity for the nlkg equation . that identity however does not lead to estimates because of a lack of positivity . in appendix  3 ,",
    "we rewrite the original morawetz inequality for the nls equation in a form which exhibits its relation to the quadratic identity derived in section  2 . in appendix  4",
    ", we justify the formal computation of section  2 by a suitable limiting procedure .",
    "we conclude this introduction by giving some notation and estimates which will be used freely throughout this paper . for any integer @xmath27 , for any @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the norm in @xmath31 , by @xmath32 the conjugate exponent defined by @xmath33 , and we define @xmath34 .",

    "in this section we derive the quadratic morawetz identity for the nls and hartree equations and we deduce therefrom the basic estimates that lead to the proof of asymptotic completeness in the energy space for those equations .",
    "we begin with a formal derivation of the quadratic morawetz identity for the nls equation , assuming sufficient smoothness and decay at infinity of the solutions to give a meaning to the calculation and in particular to the integrations by parts .",
    "the underlying algebraic structure is a pair of related conservation laws @xmath68 @xmath69    the first one is a scalar conservation law with scalar density @xmath6 and vector current @xmath70 , the second one is a vector conservation law with vector density @xmath70 and second rank tensor current @xmath71 , and the two laws are related by the fact that the current @xmath70 of the first one is at the same time the density of the second one . that situation occurs for the nls equation and with a minor modification for the hartree equation , as we shall review in this paper",
    ". it also occurs for any space time translation invariant system with a symmetric energy momentum tensor , with @xmath6 and @xmath70 being respectively the energy and momentum densities , and in particular for a class of nlkg equations , for which however it does not lead to useful estimates because of a lack of positivity ( see appendix 2 for the relevant formal calculation in that case ) .",
    "one could also consider the more general situation of two unrelated conservation laws , but that does not seem to be useful in the present case .",
    "let now @xmath72 be a sufficiently regular real even function defined in @xmath73 .",
    "the starting point is the auxiliary quantity ( which will be mostly forgotten at the end ) @xmath74    from ( 2.1 ) ( 2.2 ) and with two integrations by parts , it follows that @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the second rank tensor @xmath79 and contractions are performed in the obvious way .",
    "the quadratic morawetz identity is then the identity @xmath80    we now consider the nls equation @xmath81    where @xmath82 is a real function of @xmath4 .",
    "that equation is the euler - lagrange equation with lagrangian density @xmath83    where @xmath84    the basic structure ( 2.1 ) ( 2.2 ) is realized with @xmath4 and @xmath85    and ( 2.1 ) is the conservation law of the mass ( or charge ) .",
    "the mass current @xmath70 turns out to be the momentum density , and ( 2.2 ) becomes the momentum conservation law .",
    "in fact the energy momentum tensor @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 and ( 2.2 ) coincides ( up to sign ) with the conservation law @xmath88    with @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath2 a solution of ( 2.7 ) , @xmath90 reduces to @xmath91    so that @xmath92    the conservation law ( 2.2 ) then holds with @xmath70 and @xmath71 defined by ( 2.10 ) ( 2.14 ) , namely @xmath93    which can of course be obtained by a direct computation using ( 2.7 ) . substituting ( 2.10 ) ( 2.14 ) or ( 2.15 ) into ( 2.6 ) yields @xmath94 @xmath95    where we have used the symmetry of @xmath78 to eliminate the real part condition in the last term . on the other hand @xmath96 @xmath97    so that @xmath98    where we have used the fact that @xmath99    by integration by parts , and where @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102    integrating ( 2.18 ) over time in an interval @xmath103 $ ] yields @xmath104 @xmath105    that identity will yield useful estimates if @xmath106 and if @xmath107 is nonnegative as a matrix . under the latter assumption ,",

    "+ * sketch of proof . *",
    "the proof of part ( 1 ) consists in making the previous formal computation rigorous under the available regularity properties by introducing suitable cut offs and eliminating them by a limiting procedure .",
    "this is done in appendix  4 . at this level of regularity ,",
    "one checks easily that all the terms in the identity are well defined already in the differential form ( 2.18 ) . actually by ( 2.23 ) and sobolev inequalities",
    "@xmath131    similarly , for @xmath5 a single power @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134    with @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore @xmath136 for @xmath57 , while for @xmath137 , @xmath108 is the sum of terms of the type @xmath138 which are estimated as in ( 2.29 ) , and @xmath139 which are estimated by @xmath140 @xmath141    finally the right hand - side of ( 2.21 ) is estimated by @xmath142    part ( 2 ) follows from ( 2.21 ) by taking the limit @xmath143 , @xmath144 , from ( 2.23 ) ( 2.24 ) , from the positivity of @xmath145 and of @xmath108 , and from ( 2.32 ) .",
    "@xmath146    we now sketch briefly some further developments along the previous lines . first the formal computation leading to ( 2.18 ) can easily be extended to yield a bilinear morawetz identity for two solutions of the nls equation .",
    "actually the identity ( 2.18 ) can also be arrived at by applying the original morawetz identity @xcite to a suitable tensor product of two solutions of ( 2.7 ) .",
    "let therefore @xmath147 , @xmath148 , be two solutions of ( 2.7 ) , let @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 be the associated density , current and tensor @xmath71 , and let @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "we start from @xmath154    so that @xmath155 @xmath156    substituting ( 2.10 ) ( 2.15 ) into ( 2.35 ) and proceeding as before , we obtain @xmath157 @xmath158    where now @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161    the identity ( 2.36 ) is the bilinear version of ( 2.18 ) .",
    "remarkably enough , @xmath108 is still nonnegative in that case if @xmath78 is a nonnegative matrix . on the other hand for a repulsive ( defocusing ) @xmath5 , the terms in ( 2.36 ) containing @xmath5",
    "are also nonnegative , while the first term in the bracket is positive for @xmath23 ( but in general not for @xmath20 ) , so that in that case ( 2.36 ) yields some bilinear estimates .",
    "whether such estimates can be useful remains to be seen .    a second further development of the previous calculation consists in using for @xmath72 other functions than @xmath162 .",
    "for instance one can take @xmath163 for @xmath164 and more generally @xmath165 for @xmath166 the orthogonal projection on a generic @xmath167 dimensional plane in @xmath13 .",
    "the first choice leads naturally to an estimate of the radon transform of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one can also take advantage of the fact that the derivation of ( 2.18 ) involves mainly two integrations by parts from @xmath72 to @xmath78 in order to treat the case of a domain @xmath168 , typically the complement of a convex ( or at least star - shaped ) compact subset of @xmath13 .",
    "one then obtains identities similar to ( 2.18 ) with additional surface terms , from which one can derive estimates of solutions in @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "a third possible development consists in extending the estimates of proposition 2.1 , part ( 2 ) to the case of attractive ( focusing ) interactions @xmath5 and of small solutions .",
    "we consider for illustration the case of a single power @xmath170    in dimension @xmath57 . in that case ,",
    "( 2.18 ) becomes ( remember that @xmath136 for @xmath57 ) @xmath171    by sobolev inequalities , we estimate @xmath172    where @xmath173 is the value of @xmath174 for which @xmath5 given by ( 2.38 ) is @xmath175 critical , provided @xmath176 , namely @xmath177 .",
    "therefore @xmath178    so that ( 2.18 ) again yields an a priori estimate of @xmath6 in @xmath179 provided @xmath180 is controlled and provided @xmath2 is small in @xmath181 .",
    "the latter condition can be realized for energy solutions by taking some initial data @xmath182 small in @xmath21 if @xmath183 , namely @xmath184 , and @xmath182 small in @xmath22 if @xmath185 .",
    "that smallness condition is of the same type as that occurring in the proof of boundedness of the @xmath22 norm from the energy conservation law which is used in the standard proof of globalization in @xmath22 .",
    "a similar situation can occur in higher space dimensions in so far as one can prove the estimate @xmath186    where again @xmath187 is the critical sobolev exponent corresponding to @xmath132 , provided @xmath176 , namely @xmath188 , the @xmath21 critical value .",
    "the estimate ( 2.42 ) can be proved easily by the use of sobolev inequalities for @xmath189 and @xmath132 not too large .",
    "we leave the investigation of that estimate for general @xmath1 and @xmath132 as an open question .    a last possible development",
    "consists in using the morawetz inequality to prove global wellposedeness and possibly ac ( `` scattering '' ) at a lower level of regularity than @xmath22 , and that possibility has been extensively exploited .",
    "see for instance @xcite-@xcite @xcite-@xcite @xcite @xcite and references therein quoted .",
    "in particular the right hand - side of ( 2.21 ) is controlled by the @xmath26 norm of @xmath2 . for completeness",
    "we give a proof of that fact in appendix 1 ( see also @xcite for the case @xmath19 ) .",
    "we now turn to the hartree equation ( 1.1 ) with @xmath5 given by ( 1.3 ) .",
    "the formal computation is almost the same as for the nls equation , except for the fact that , because of the nonlocality of the interaction , the equation is not lagrangian .",
    "however the evolution equation of @xmath70 for the nls equation takes the form @xmath190    as follows in the same way as ( 2.15 ) from a computation which can be done without referring to the special form of @xmath5 , so that ( 2.43 ) also holds for the hartree equation ( 1.1 ) ( 1.3 ) . substituting ( 2.43 ) into @xmath191 and using the fact that the kinetic terms are unchanged",
    ", we obtain @xmath192    where @xmath108 is given by ( 2.20 ) as before . integrating ( 2.44 ) over time in an interval @xmath103 $ ] yields @xmath193 @xmath194    as in the case of the nls equation , that identity will yield useful estimates if @xmath106 and if @xmath107 is nonnegative as a matrix , so that @xmath108 is nonnegative , and if in addition the potential term in ( 2.45 ) is nonnegative .",
    "we now show that this is the case if @xmath11 is radial and nonincreasing . assuming sufficient smoothness and decay at infinity for @xmath11",
    ", we obtain @xmath195 @xmath196    where we have used the fact that @xmath197 is an odd function . in order to prove the positivity of that integral , it suffices to prove that for all @xmath198 , @xmath199 @xmath200    where we have changed variables from @xmath201 to @xmath202 .",
    "let now @xmath203 .",
    "the left hand - side of ( 2.47 ) can be written as @xmath204 @xmath205    for nonpositive @xmath206 and nonnegative @xmath107 .",
