    "lowest - lying scalar mesons ( scalar mesons below 1 gev ) are of fundamental importance in understanding the theory and phenomenology of low energy qcd .",
    "however , the properties of these scalars , in particular their quark substructure , are not quite understood . as a result",
    "they are at the focus of many theoretical and experimental investigations .    from the experimental point of view , there are at least four well established light scalars  the isosinglet @xmath3 and the isotriplet @xmath4 .",
    "there are also five other candidates  the isosinglet @xmath5 , and two isodoublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are not quite established experimentally . in 1998 edition of particle date group @xcite , the @xmath8",
    "is listed as @xmath9 with a very uncertain properties ; a mass between 400 to 1200 mev and a very broad decay width between 600 to 1000 mev . in a recent experimental study of @xmath10 lepton decay by cleo collaboration @xcite , a significant contribution due to",
    "the @xmath11 is pointed out and it is reported that inclusion of a @xmath11 with @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev significantly improves the fits .",
    "the situation of @xmath14 is not clear experimentally .",
    "therefore , altogether there are 9 possible candidates for lowest lying scalar mesons .",
    "the situation of these scalars is also not clear from the theoretical point of view ; there are model dependent calculations , and as a result , different conclusions . however , within any theoretical framework two basic questions should be addressed :    \\1 .",
    "is there a clear evidence for the existence of a @xmath5 and a @xmath14 ?",
    "can we describe the properties of these mesons like their masses , decay widths , interactions , and in particular their quark substructure ?    in this talk",
    "we first review the general nonlinear chiral lagrangian framework of refs .",
    "@xcite , and discuss how within this framework a @xmath8 was observed in @xcite , and a @xmath6 was observed in @xcite .",
    "we then review how this nonlinear chiral lagrangian can be rewritten in terms of a scalar nonet by introducing a few new free parameters .",
    "we show how these parameters as well as the acceptable range of the scalar mixing angle can be fixed by considering the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering , and the @xmath2 decay . based on the acceptable range of the scalar mixing angle",
    "we discuss that the quark substructure of the light scalar mesons is closer to a four quark picture .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the results .",
    "we work within the effective non - linear chiral lagrangian framework .",
    "the pseudoscalar part of the lagrangian is @xcite @xmath15 \\label{l_phi}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 mev , @xmath17 is the dominant symmetry breaking term , and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pseudoscalar nonet @xmath20 . \\label{nonet_phi}\\ ] ] @xmath21 transforms linearly under chiral transformation [ @xmath22 with @xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 transforms nonlinearly [ @xmath25 .    the vectors can be introduced in this framework in terms of the vector nonet @xmath26 with a lagrangian that has the same form as that of usual gauge fields @xmath27   - \\frac{1}{4 } \\mbox{tr } \\left [ f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\rho ) f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\rho ) \\right ] \\label{l_rho}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 $ ] . in ( [ l_rho ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and have simple transformation properties under chiral transformation .",
    "we introduce scalars into this picture in two stages .",
    "first in order to see whether there is an indication of @xmath5 and @xmath6 within our framework , we introduce scalars in a phenomenological way . we consider a general isospin invariant form @xcite @xmath31 and take the coupling constants as independent parameters",
    " we either take the couplings as fitting parameters or input them from experimental measurements .    now in order to see whether this framework sees a @xmath11 and/or a @xmath32 , we can consider computing processes to which these mesons could significantly contribute , and then compare our prediction to the experimental data and search for signs of these scalars . in principle @xmath8 and @xmath6",
    "can be probed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering , respectively .",
    "in fact , their contributions could be substantial as they appear as poles in the scattering amplitudes . to see the effect of @xmath32 , using lagrangian ( [ l_s1 ] ) ,",
    "appropriate @xmath1 scattering amplitudes were computed in @xcite and the result were matched to the experimental data .",
    "the scattering amplitudes were computed by only taking tree level feynman diagrams into account  this is motivated by @xmath33 expansion .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a @xmath32 with a mass around 900 mev and a decay width around 320 mev is needed in order to describe the experimental data on the @xmath1 scattering .",
    "this technique was first developed in @xcite , in which it was shown that in order to agree with the @xmath0 experimental data there is a need for a @xmath11 meson with a mass around 550 mev and a decay width around 370 mev .    therefore within our theoretical framework there is a clear signal for both the @xmath8 and the @xmath6 .",
    "this motivates us , in our second stage of investigation , to combine these scalars together with the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 into a light scalar nonet , in terms of which we rewrite our lagrangian in the next section .",
    "we now construct a light scalar nonet out of @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the form @xmath34 . \\label{nonet_n}\\ ] ] in general , @xmath8 and @xmath3 are a mixture of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we represent this mixing in terms of a scalar mixing angle @xmath37 as @xmath38 in this parametrization , @xmath39 corresponds to the conventional ideal mixing when a pure @xmath40 assignment is used for @xmath41 .",
    "another interesting limit is @xmath42 which corresponds to the dual ideal mixing when a pure four - quark assignment is used to describe @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we can now rewrite the scalar sector of our lagrangian in terms of the nonet ( [ nonet_n ] ) @xmath43 with @xmath44diag @xmath45 is the spurion matrix with @xmath46 the ratio of strange to non - strange quark masses .",
    "the mass part of the lagrangian is given in terms of new free parameters @xmath47 , and @xmath37 which can be determined by inputting the scalar masses @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we find that our model restricts @xmath50 in the range 685 to 980 mev , and also for any input of scalar masses there are two solutions for @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in our framework there are two acceptable ranges for the scalar mixing angle which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_theta_s ] .",
    "these are the _ large angle solution _ : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the _ small angle solution _ : @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath50 varies from its minimum value to its maximum , these regions are entirely swept through .",
    "there are also new free parameters @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in the scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar interaction part of lagrangian which can be determined by appropriately matching our theoretical prediction to the experimental data .",
    "a consequence of introducing the nonet ( [ nonet_n ] ) is that the scalar couplings are now related to each other by the underlying chiral symmetry , i.e. @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the pseudoscalar mixing angle for which we choose the value @xmath58 .",
    "we numerically search through both ranges of @xmath37 and fit our prediction for @xmath1 scattering amplitude to the experimental data .",
    "this determines @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the interaction lagrangian .",
    "we find that the @xmath61 of fit improves as we lower @xmath50 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mk ] , together with the @xmath50 dependence of the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the interaction lagrangian , and the total decay width of @xmath32 .",
    "although the @xmath61 fit improves for lower values of @xmath50 , other experimental data further restricts the acceptable range of @xmath50 .",
    "we take into account limits from @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xcite on the strong interaction couplings @xmath62 , as well as the decay width @xmath63 $ ] .",
    ".3 cm the @xmath50 dependence of the resulting couplings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma ] .",
    "we find that the small angle solution is favored as it contains a small region ( corresponding to 875 mev @xmath64 897 mev ) that is consistent with these experimental constraints .",
    "this region , which is bounded by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_theta_s ] , is obviously close to @xmath65 .",
    "this is how our model indirectly probes the quark substructure of this scalar nonet  the fact that @xmath37 is small means that the scalar mixing in our model is closer to the dual ideal mixing and therefore a four - quark scenario is favored for this nonet .",
    "in the previous section we rewrote the scalar part of the lagrangian in terms of a scalar nonet @xmath41 .",
    "we evaluated all free parameters in the lagrangian except @xmath66 and @xmath55 in the interaction piece in ( [ npp ] ) .",
    "these two parameters were probed in ref .",
    "@xcite by matching the prediction of our model for the partial decay width of @xmath2 , and for the energy dependence of the normalized magnitude of the decay matrix element , to the experimental data . the same values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath37 that were found in ref",
    "@xcite were used in this decay analysis .",
    "the @xmath67 parameter space was scanned numerically and was searched for the physical regions that describe both experimental measurements of this decay .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cd ] .",
    "the gray region is consistent with the partial decay width of this decay , and the solid line is consistent with the energy dependence of the normalized magnitude of the decay matrix element .",
    "their intersection in the @xmath67 plane ( @xmath68 gev@xmath69 and @xmath70 gev@xmath69 ) _ exists _ and is _ unique_.",
    "this means that there is a unique choice of free parameters of lagrangian ( [ npp ] ) that , in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering amplitudes , describes the @xmath2 decay .",
    "the energy dependence of this decay is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_energy ] .    as a by - product",
    "we compute , with the same extracted @xmath66 and @xmath55 , the partial decay width of @xmath71 to be approximately 65 mev .",
    "this , together with the @xmath72\\approx 5 mev$ ] found in @xcite , provide an estimate of the total decay width of @xmath4 around 70 mev .",
    "this is in a very close agreement with a recent experimental analysis of @xmath4 in ref .",
    "in this talk we reviewed the light scalar mesons in the non - linear chiral lagrangian framework of references @xcite .",
    "we saw that in this approach there is a need for the @xmath8 and the @xmath6 in order to be able to describe the experimental data on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "we then constructed a light scalar nonet below 1 gev consisting of @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , and rewrote the lagrangian in terms of this nonet by introducing eight new free parameters .",
    "we showed that with these parameters we can describe many experimental facts including the scalar mass spectrum , their interactions with pseudoscalars in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering , the @xmath73 decay , and the decay width of @xmath3 .",
    "we could predict the total decay width of @xmath74 mev in a very close agreement with a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "we discussed that although the chiral lagrangian model presented here is entirely formulated in terms of the meson fields and in principle does not know anything about the underlying quark substructure , in practice , the knowledge of the mixing angle indirectly probes the quark substructure of these scalars .",
    "we saw , through a careful numerical analysis , that the acceptable range of the mixing angle is such that it suggests the quark substructure of these scalars is closer to a four quark picture .",
    "this is in agreement with a recent theoretical investigation @xcite .",
