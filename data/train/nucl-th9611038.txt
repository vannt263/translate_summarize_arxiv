    "<S> the effects of an interplay of radial expansion of the thermalized system created in a heavy ion collision and directed flow are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the study of azimuthal anisotropy of particle distribution as a function of rapidity _ and _ transverse momentum could reveal important information on both radial and directed flow .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the study of collective flow in nuclear collisions at high energies has attracted an increased attention of both theoreticians and experimentalists . </S>",
    "<S> there are several reasons for that : i ) the observation of anisotropic flow at the ags  @xcite and , probably , at the sps  @xcite energies , ii ) better theoretical understanding of the relation between appearance and development of flow pattern during the fireball evolution and the processes such as thermalization , creation of quark - gluon plasma , phase transitions , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , iii ) the study of mean field effects  @xcite , iv ) the importance of flow for other measurements such as two - particle interferometry  @xcite , v ) development of new techniques suitable for flow study at high energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although all forms of flow are interrelated and represent only different parts of one global picture , usually people discuss different forms of collective flow , such as longitudinal expansion , radial transverse expansion , directed flow , elliptic flow  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> flow introduces strong space - momentum correlation in the particle production . </S>",
    "<S> particles with a given rapidity and transverse momentum are produced only by some part of the entire source . </S>",
    "<S> this part we call as an effective source . </S>",
    "<S> it moves with the rapidity close to that of the particles  @xcite in the midrapidity region , or slightly less than that for particles in the fragmentation region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subject of the current study is transverse ( radial and directed ) flow , namely the questions how azimuthally symmetric radial flow interferes with directed flow and affects the directed flow signal .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to characterize directed flow by @xmath0 , the amplitude of the first harmonic in the fourier decomposition of the particle azimuthal distribution  @xcite . depending on which particular distribution </S>",
    "<S> is studied , the coefficients in the fourier decomposition depend on different variables . </S>",
    "<S> if it is a 2-dimensional rapidity and azimuthal angle distribution , then @xmath0 depends only on rapidity , and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean transverse momentum , and @xmath3 is an another widely used quantity to describe flow , the mean projection of the transverse momentum onto the reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> if one studies the production of particles with a given rapidity and transverse momentum , then @xmath4 and @xmath0 depends on two variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence @xmath7 for particles with a given rapidity is the main topic of the current study . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the radial expansion of the source results in specific shapes of this function , which can be studied experimentally , providing an information on the directed as well as radial components of the effective source velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> first studies of event shape anisotropy as a function of transverse momentum  @xcite have shown very interesting results . </S>",
    "<S> such a study using fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution promises better quantitative description of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages would be the possibility to correct the results for the reaction plane resolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xmath7 is to a large extend independent from the uncertainties in the @xmath6 dependence of spectrometer acceptance and efficiency , and in this sense such an analysis has preference in comparison with the analysis of triple differential distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> transverse directed flow is a result of a movement of an effective source in the transverse plane ( below we assume that this movement is along the `` x '' axis ) . in the source </S>",
    "<S> rest frame the first moment of azimuthal distribution ( @xmath0 ) is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the final anisotropy ( here and below we discuss only the first harmonic of the azimuthal distribution ) appears only as a consequence of the source movement in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> below we derive a general expression for @xmath0 , assuming that the invariant distribution in the source rest frame is known and ( for simplicity ) azimuthally symmetric : @xmath8 source movement in the transverse direction results in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is defined by the lorentz shift with velocity @xmath11 along the `` x '' axis . assuming that the shift is small ( the directed flow velocity expected to be @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 , and taking into account that @xmath14 , one gets : @xmath15 a comparison of exact numerical calculations for the models discussed below with the results of application of this formula shows that for the values of @xmath12 , the formula  ( [ ev1 ] ) is accurate at the level of a few percent .    </S>",
    "<S> below we apply the derived formula to a few particular cases , when the thermal source undergoes an isotropic expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider an expansion in a non - relativistic case , then go to a relativistic generalization , and , finally , discuss a model of isotropically expanding thermal shell  @xcite , widely used in the analysis of bevalac and sis data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using simple models permits us to perform all calculations analytically to keep clear the qualitative features of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> note that directed as well as isotropic expansion velocities are defined in the frame moving longitudinally with the rapidity of the effective source .    </S>",
    "<S> directed flow of protons is the most pronounced and less affected by another effects such as shadowing . </S>",
    "<S> protons are relatively heavy particles ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the proton mass , @xmath18 is the temperature ) , and often can be treated as non - relativistic particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly justified in the source rest frame , where the proton kinetic energy is of the order of temperature @xmath19 . to have possibility to treat protons non - relativistically in the transverse direction in the _ analysis _ frame we have to assume that @xmath20 , what restricts the non - relativistic consideration to the region of @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the transverse isotropic expansion of the source can be described as a superposition of different sources moving radially with an expansion velocity @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> then the ( non - relativistic ) transverse momentum distribution of protons from a radially expanding thermal source can be written as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 . the integration over @xmath25 ( the orientation of the expansion velocity ) results in the distribution : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the modified bessel function , and @xmath28 .    using the formula  ( [ ev1 ] ) one </S>",
    "<S> gets an expression for @xmath0 : @xmath29 in our analysis we work in the frame moving longitudinally with the effective source rapidity . in this frame </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal particle momenta usually can be neglected , what was done in the derivation above . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers the particle production with rapidities far from the rapidity of the effective source , when particle longitudinal momenta are large , one should make a substitution @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from ( [ v1nr ] ) that in the case without radial expansion @xmath0 linearly depends on the transverse momentum with the slope of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial expansion of the system decreases the directed flow signal changing also the shape of @xmath7 in the low @xmath6 region . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , that at some parameter values , namely such that @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 it corresponds to @xmath34 ) , @xmath7 has a region ( at small @xmath6 ) , where it is negative ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> physically it corresponds to the case , when particle production with such a value of @xmath6 is more probable from the part of the effective source which moves to the opposite direction than the flow direction ( in this case directed flow and `` expansion '' flow compensate each other ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic generalization of the above formulae is strait - forward , although results into somewhat less transparent expressions . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant distribution in this case can be written in the form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the transverse rapidity ; @xmath27 and @xmath39 are modified bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution yields : @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{v1rel}\\ ] ] note , that the energy @xmath41 is measured in the frame moving longitudinally with the same velocity as an effective source . </S>",
    "<S> studying particle production close to the fragmentation region , one should remember , that the rapidity of the effective source could be less than that of the particles  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the effective source rapidity .    </S>",
    "<S> if the particles are emitted from a thermalized _ spherical shell _ at temperature @xmath18 , expanding with velocity @xmath44 ( we use different notation to distinguish @xmath44 from @xmath22 , the expansion velocity in the transverse _ plane _ ) , the expected invariant distribution has the form  @xcite : @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> an application of the prescription  ( [ ev1 ] ) gives : @xmath48\\beta_r e /p      </S>",
    "<S> \\right\\ } / \\left\\ {        ( e + t/\\gamma)\\sinh(\\alpha)/\\alpha      -\\cosh(\\alpha ) t/\\gamma \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] qualitatively this model predicts the same dependencies @xmath7 as the model with the expansion only in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> but the value of the expansion velocity needed in this model for @xmath7 exhibits a dip at low @xmath6 is about 15% larger due to the 3-dimensional type of the expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , it is shown that a study of the dependence of the amplitude of the first harmonic in the azimuthal distributions on transverse momentum reveals important features of directed and transverse radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and the shape of @xmath7 is very sensitive to such parameters of the system as an effective temperature , radial expansion and directed flow velocities . </S>",
    "<S> strong radial expansion ( approximately @xmath49 ) would evidence itself in the directed flow signal showing an anti - flow of the particles with low transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary results of e877 collaboration presented at hip - ags  96 workshop  @xcite suggests that such a regime could be the case in gold - gold collisions at the ags .    </S>",
