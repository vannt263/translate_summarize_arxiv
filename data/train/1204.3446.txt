    "this article is about a simple inhomogeneous physical system consisting of two distinct electrical media in contact with one another which are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "such system is easily accessible in experiments and can serve as a tool for testing quantum mechanics ( and its classical limit ) and crossover between retardation and non - retarded effects .    the special geometry of two semi - infinite media with a flat interface , formulated in the three - dimensional cartesian space of points @xmath0 , is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the two media with the distinct frequency - dependent dielectric functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 occupy the complementary half - spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the flat interface between media is the plane @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that , in gauss units , @xmath6 for vacuum , while the static dielectric constant @xmath7 is finite ( @xmath8 ) for dielectrics and diverging , @xmath9 , for conductors .",
    "the system is translationally invariant along each plane formed by the two coordinates @xmath10 perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the media have no magnetic structure and the magnetic permeabilities @xmath12 .",
    "non - relativistic charged particles forming the two media and the radiated electromagnetic ( em ) field are in thermal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath13 , or the inverse temperature @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the boltzmann constant .",

    "it is understood as being the microscopic volume charge density integrated along the @xmath11-axis on some microscopic depth from the interface . according to the elementary electrodynamics",
    ", the surface charge density is associated with the discontinuity of the normal @xmath11 component of the microscopic electric field at the interface : @xmath19 , \\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath20 means approaching the interface through the limit @xmath21 .",
    "the tangential @xmath22 and @xmath23 components of the electric field are continuous at the interface .",
    "the correlation of fluctuations of the surface charge density at two points on the interface , with times different by @xmath17 and distances different by @xmath24 , is described by the ( symmetrized ) correlation function @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents a truncated equilibrium average at the inverse temperature @xmath27 , @xmath28 . with regard to ( [ surfacecharge ] ) , this correlation function is related to fluctuations of the electric field on the interface .",
    "although the system is not in a critical state , the combination of the spatial inhomogeneity and long - ranged em interactions in the media causes that the asymptotic large - distance behavior of the surface charge correlation function ( [ structurefunction ] ) exhibits , in general , the long - range tail of type @xmath29 with some prefactor ( slope ) function @xmath30 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath31 , where the wave vector @xmath32 . in the sense of distributions , the fourier transform of @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , @xmath35 has a kink singularity at @xmath36 : @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is measurable by scattering experiments .",
    "the fact that it is linear in @xmath40 for small @xmath40 makes this quantity very different from the usual bulk structure functions with short - range ( usually exponential ) decays which are proportional to @xmath41 in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the form of the prefactor function @xmath30 depends on `` the physical model '' used . defining media",

    ", the speed of light is taken to be infinite , @xmath46 , ignoring in this way magnetic forces . in the retarded regime , @xmath47 is assumed finite and so the charged particles are fully coupled to both electric and magnetic parts of the radiated em field . according to the bohr - van leeuwen theorem @xcite , magnetic degrees of freedom can be effectively eliminated from statistical averages of classical systems for the static case @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 .",
    "if the em field is thermalized , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the decoupling arises only at distances larger than the thermal photon wavelength @xmath50 , where the em field itself can be treated classically .",
    "quantum electrodynamics must be used at shorter distances , which invalidates the decoupling .",

    "the media configuration studied in the past was exclusively a conductor in contact with vacuum .",

    "the dynamical properties of the jellium have a special feature : there is no viscous damping of the long - wavelength plasma oscillations @xcite . in the non - retarded regime of the maxwell equations , the frequencies of nondispersive long - wavelength collective modes , namely @xmath58 of the bulk plasmons and @xmath59 of the surface plasmons , are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "a crossover between the retarded and non - retarded regions was found at @xmath85 : if @xmath86 @xmath87 , the slope function @xmath45 @xmath88 takes place .",
    "after the short overview , we shall investigate how the classical static result ( [ classstat ] ) modifies itself for a spherically curved interface between two media ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "firstly , in section 2 , we provide an alternative derivation of ( [ classstat ] ) for the flat interface by using a combination of microscopic and macroscopic approaches .",
    "this method allows us to generalize the classical static result to the spherical interface between media in section 3 .",
    "our strategy is to compute , for an arbitrary configuration of two points @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the media 1 and 2 , the correlation function @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the microscopic electric potential created by constituents of the media at point @xmath89 .",
    "it is related to the microscopic charge density @xmath93 by @xmath94 , where the integral is over the whole space . since @xmath95",

    ", we obtain @xmath103 where @xmath104 means the standard equilibrium average in the absence of the test charge @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , @xmath105 .\\ ] ]    the shift of the mean potential at @xmath90 due to the test charge @xmath40 at @xmath89 , @xmath106 , is determined by using the macroscopic method of images @xcite .",
    "if both points @xmath89 and @xmath90 are inside medium 1 , the shift is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the position of the image charge @xmath109 . if both points @xmath89 and @xmath90 are inside medium 2 , the formula ( [ image11 ] ) with interchanged indices 1 and 2 applies .",
    "if @xmath89 is in medium 1 and @xmath90 is in medium 2 , or vice versa , it holds @xmath110    inserting the shift of the mean potential to ( [ shift ] ) for all four possible configurations of points @xmath89 and @xmath90 in media 1 and 2 , using ( [ field ] ) and the relations @xmath111 we find that @xmath112 @xmath113 considering these correlators in ( [ surfacechargecorr ] ) , we end up with the classical static result ( [ classstat ] ) .",

    "the radial component of the electric field , normal to the surface of the sphere , is given by @xmath140 .",

    ", the angle @xmath118 between the points @xmath144 and @xmath145 on the sphere of radius @xmath114 is given by @xmath148 .",
    "the above two formulas hold for all macroscopic distances @xmath149 and sphere radiuses @xmath114 .",
    "a special case of physical interest is the fixed distance @xmath149 and the large radius limit @xmath150 .",
    "writing @xmath151 with @xmath152 and using the small-@xmath153 expansions @xmath154^{5/2 } } = \\frac{2}{3\\varepsilon^2 } + \\frac{3 - 2\\mu}{6\\varepsilon^{3/2 } }   + \\frac{2 - 3\\mu+\\mu^2}{6\\varepsilon } + \\cdots , \\ ] ] @xmath154^{3/2 } } = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon } + \\cdots\\ ] ] ( @xmath155 ) , we obtain @xmath156 .",
    "thus from ( [ result ] ) we conclude that @xmath157 the leading term , invariant with respect to the media interchange @xmath158 , corresponds to the classical static result for the flat interface ( [ classstat ] ) .",
    "the first curvature correction changes the sign under @xmath158 ; this is expected since the media interchange is effectively equivalent to the change of the interface curvature to the opposite one .",
    "another interesting case is the antipode configuration with @xmath159 , for which curvature effects are not erased . substituting @xmath160 in the integral ( [ subresult ] ) , @xmath161 is expressible in terms of harmonic numbers @xcite .",
    "an open question is a sphere extension of the quantum time - dependent result ( [ quantumr ] ) , derived for a flat interface by taking into account the retardation .",
    "this result should be recovered in the large radius limit @xmath162 , while curvature effects might invalidate it for @xmath163 .",
