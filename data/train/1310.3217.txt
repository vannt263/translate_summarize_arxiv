    "recent studies have shown that brain networks obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) recordings are altered in patients with severe disorder of consciousness ( doc)@xcite .",
    "doc can result from severe brain injury and is characterized by an absence of awareness of the self and the environment , either with preserved or disrupted sleep - awake cycle .",
    "doc encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical conditions with different levels in the content of conscious awareness , ranging from the coma state ( cs , patients who have a disrupted sleep - awake cycle and do nt wake up ) , vegetative state ( vs , who preserve sleep - awake cycle but are unaware of themselves and the environment ) , minimally consciousness state ( mcs , patients who are unable to reliably communicate but show reproducible albeit fluctuating behavioral evidence of awareness ) , to lock - in syndrome ( li , patients who are fully conscious but are completely paralyzed except for small movements of the eyes or eyelids ) . for the prognosis of these patients , the clinical practice scores this graduation in doc response by the glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) @xcite , or as we will use in this paper , by an alternative scale such as the jfk coma recovery scale - revised ( csr - r ) @xcite .",
    "this scale encodes the neurological and behavioural state of the doc patient providing a number ranging from 0 to 23 , 0 for the deepest coma state , 23 for the fully recovered one . despite the existence of such scales , there is a need for more reliable methods that based on brain neuroimaging can provide better characterization of the large - scale disturbances of brain function in doc .",
    "ultimately these approaches should help in understanding and eventually predicting coma outcome .",
    "the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fmri ) accounts for the spontaneous brain activity occurring in the high - amplitude ultra - slow ( 0.1 hz ) fluctuations in the blood - oxygen - level - dependent ( bold ) signal , defining networks of correlated spontaneous activity of brain functional connectivity ( fc ) @xcite .",
    "the interaction between these distributed networks as well as subcortical modules is considered critical for conscious processing , and has been shown to be disrupted in doc state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the rs - fmri paradigm is a very suitable strategy for doc patients , since they are not able to efficiently perform specific tasks",
    ". the present study addresses the question of whether the fc obtained from the rs - fmri is altered at different brain regions as a consequence of consciousness disturbances . to this end",
    ", we investigate the fc obtained by two different measures : the partial correlation ( pc ) and the transfer entropy ( te ) , in two different groups : healthy adults and doc patients .",
    "information theory offers an arsenal of different measures , complementing the linear correlation estimations of fc .",
    "these information tools are typically built as extensions of the shannon entropy , quantify the interactions between variables by measuring the information which is shared or transferred between them @xcite . in the last decade , the transfer entropy ( te ) method is growing in popularity as it can account for directed interactions between time - series variables @xcite . when applied to neuroimaging time - series",
    ", te is a data - driven measure that assesses the functional connectivity between brain areas even for non - linear interactions . unlike the correlations , te reveals directionality in the interactions , allowing for determining a _ directed _ fc between areas .",
    "we hypothesize that fc would be reduced in doc patients since consciousness implies functional integration @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that pc and te would show different behaviors in patients with increasing level of consciousness , provided that they can be related to different mechanisms of information processing in the brain .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in material and methods , we give details on the the data acquisition and preprocessing and define the two measures pc and te to compute fc patterns .",
    "the next section is dedicated to present the results of the analysis .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion on some consequences of the alteration of the fc patterns in doc patients .",
    "seventeen healthy subjects ( * group 1 * ) aged 25 @xmath0 5 year old ( 8 men , 9 women ) , with no history of neurological or psychiatric problems , participated in this study as a control group . the edinburgh handedness inventory was used to assess handedness @xcite , resulting in thirteen subjects right - handed and four left - handed .",
    "eleven doc patients ( * group 2 * ) were scanned ( age range , 17- 44 years ; 6 men , 5 women ) .",
    "data from two patients were subsequently excluded because of unacceptable degrees of head and body movements . the coma severity for each patient",
    "was clinically assessed using the revised coma recovery scale ( crs - r , @xcite ) : scores range from 0 ( meaning deep coma state ) to 23 ( full recovery ) .",
    "the patients were scanned the first time between 2 to 6 months after major acute brain injury , and a second time between 3 to 6 months after the first scan ( table [ table1 ] ) . for better comparison ,",
    "group 2 was subdivided into 2 subgroups : * group 2a * ( n = 12 ) is composed by all scans of doc patients who had a corresponding crs - r scale . *",
    "group 2b * ( n = 4 ) includes the second scans of the four patients who recovered consciousness before the second session ( marked with asterisks in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the institute of neurological research fleni .",
    "informed consent was directly obtained from healthy participants and from the next kin of each of the patients .",
