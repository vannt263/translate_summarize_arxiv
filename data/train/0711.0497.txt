    "recently , there are many exciting discoveries on new hadron states especially in the hidden - charm sector . among these discoveries ,",
    "the most intriguing one is the new relatively narrow peak named @xmath1 found by belle collaboration in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath11 in the decay mode @xmath12@xcite .",
    "there is a large branching fraction for the following decay chain : @xmath13 mass and width of this particle are measured as : @xmath14 the most prominent characteristic is that it is electric charged , that s to say , this new particle can not be described as an ordinary charmonium state or a charmonium - like state such as @xmath15 . on the other hand , this particle can decay to @xmath16 with a large rate through strong interactions , so it involves at least four quarks @xmath17 , though there is not any further detailed information on its inner dynamics at present .",
    "in order to elucidate this particle , many theoretical studies @xcite have been put forward .",
    "this meson could be viewed as a genuine tetraquark state with diquark anti - diquark @xmath18[\\bar c \\bar d]$ ] content which has a large rate to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "moreover based on qcd - string , two different four - quark descriptions are proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : one can be reduced to the ordinary diquark - diquark picture and the other one can not . besides this kind of explanation , it has also been identified as the resonance of @xmath20 @xcite as its mass is close to the thresholds of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . within this picture , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite explored the production of @xmath23 and @xmath19",
    ". short distance contribution to @xmath24 is neglected and the main contribution is from long distance re - scattering effect via @xmath25 . with proper parameters",
    ", they can successfully explain the much larger production rate of @xmath19 than that of @xmath23 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bugg took this meson as a @xmath26 threshold cusp .",
    "recently , qiao also tried to explain this meson with the baryonium picture @xcite . using the technique of qcd sum rules , lee @xmath27 calculated the masses of this particle and its strange partner @xmath6 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    whether or not these scenarios describe the true dynamics of @xmath1",
    ", this strange meson indeed plays an important role in the charmonium spectroscopy . in the present paper , we do not intend to give an explanation of this meson s structure , but we want to analyze its partners within su(3 ) symmetry : the octet to which the meson @xmath1 belongs and the corresponding singlet meson . up to now , these is no experimental information on these mesons except @xmath28 .",
    "the decays of @xmath2 meson provide a firm potential in searching for these exotic mesons @xcite , just like the observed decay channel @xmath29 .",
    "we will investigate the possibilities to detect these @xmath7 mesons in @xmath30 decays . in doing this",
    ", we will analyze decay amplitudes with the assumption of su(3 ) flavor symmetry : to construct effective hamiltonian using flavor su(3 ) meson matrixes .",
    "the decay amplitudes can also be studied by using feynmann diagrams . in the discussion of @xmath7 production with the graphic technique ,",
    "we only consider short - distance contributions and neglect soft final state interactions .",
    "specifically , the considered decays are divided into three categories : cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) allowed non - leptonic decays ; ckm suppressed non - leptonic decays ; radiative decays .",
    "the first kind of decays have similar branching ratios with the observed @xmath31 , while the second type of decays is suppressed by about one order in magnitude and we will show that the running @xmath2 factories could hardly detect this kind of decays .",
    "radiative @xmath2 decay is a natural filter to exclude the 0-spin mesons and furthermore this kind of process may go through with a sizable branching ratio .    in the next section",
    ", we will analyze the octet of @xmath7 meson within flavor su(3 ) symmetry and try to estimate their masses .",
    "we will construct the effective hamiltonian using meson matrices and then use them to study the production rates of @xmath7 mesons in @xmath2 decays . in sec.[zccc ] , we will introduce @xmath8 meson which consists of three charm quarks , together with a brief discussion on its production in @xmath10 decays .",
    "we will summarize this note in the last section .",
    "just as stated above , @xmath1 involves at least four quarks in constituent quark model , and there is an octet which @xmath1 belongs to in flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "generally , we can deduce the particles in this octet using group theory : these particles , under the name @xmath28 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram : octet ] .",
    "besides , there exists one singlet meson called @xmath37 . in constituent quark model ,",
    "quark contents of these mesons are listed by : @xmath38 in reality , @xmath39 quark is slightly heavier than @xmath40 quark which is one of the origins for su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "accordingly , the singlet @xmath37 can mix with eighth component of the octet @xmath36 , in analogy with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "physical particles , named @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are mixtures of them and can be expressed as : @xmath45 the mixing angle @xmath46 can be determined through measuring decays of these two particles in future . for simplicity , we will assume the mixing is ideal , i.e. @xmath47 . in this case ,",
    "the quark contents are : @xmath48 all together , one can use the following meson matrix to describe these mesons : @xmath49     meson octet . ]    with the quark contents given in the above , we are ready to estimate masses of these particles .",
    "isospin analysis predicts the equal masses for the four mesons with neither open nor hidden strangeness : @xmath50 . for the mesons with a strange quark ,",
    "the mass differences between the lighter @xmath40 quarks and the heavier @xmath39 quark are required .",
    "one can compare masses of @xmath51 and @xmath52 to get some information : the mass of @xmath52 is @xmath53 mev larger than that of @xmath54 . in heavy quark limit",
    "@xmath55 , the light system will not be affected by different heavy quark systems , thus we can simply assume a similar difference for @xmath7 mesons which predicts the mass of @xmath6 around @xmath56 mev . because the mass of newly observed @xmath7 meson is not far from the threshold of @xmath21 , @xmath57 meson is regarded as the resonance of @xmath58 @xcite . under this mechanism , we could give more precise predictions on the masses for other @xmath7 mesons using experimental results for the @xmath54 and @xmath59 mesons .",
    "our results are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : mass ] and uncertainties in this table are from that of masses of the charmed mesons . in the heavy quark limit , mesons with the same light system can be related to each other .",
    "but if the @xmath7 particles are viewed as tetra - quark states , the effective strange quark mass in @xmath7 could be different from that in the usual mesons as the light systems in the two kinds of particles are different .",
    "if @xmath7 mesons are described as molecules , probably they would not belong to a full su(3 ) nonet and the predicted masses may not be suitable . currently , there is no better solution and we will use this assumption in the present study .",
    "the recent qcd sum rule study predicts the mass by @xcite : @xmath60 which is above the @xmath61 and @xmath62 threshold by about 160 mev .",
    "more experimental studies are required to test this description .",
    ".@xmath7 meson and its mass [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath63 , the heavy @xmath64 quark decays into @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is produced from vacuum .",
    "subsequently , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the spectator @xmath69 can be transferred into @xmath7 , and the quarks left form a kaon .",
    "the other @xmath7 states can also be produced by selecting a different quark pair @xmath66 or changing the @xmath39 quark by @xmath70 quark .",
    "we give the decay amplitudes for non - leptonic @xmath71 decay channels induced by @xmath72 transition in table  [ tab : ampltiudesofbtod ] .",
    "these decays are suppressed by ckm matrix elements @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is one example of this kind of decays and the product branching ratio is : @xmath75\\times   \\mathcal{br}[z_s^-\\to k^{-}\\psi^{\\prime}]\\nonumber\\\\   & = & |\\frac{v_{cd}}{v_{cs}}|^2 \\times\\mathcal{br}[\\bar b^{0}\\to z^+(4430)k^-]\\times \\mathcal{br}[z^+(4430)\\to\\pi^{+}\\psi^{\\prime}]\\nonumber\\\\   & = & ( 2.3\\pm0.6\\pm0.7)\\times10^{-6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are from the experimental results for @xmath78\\times \\mathcal{br}[z^+(4430)\\to\\pi^{+}\\psi^{\\prime}]$ ] . in the above calculation ,",
    "mass differences and lifetime differences are neglected again . from the branching ratio for this decay chain",
    ", we can see that this kind of process receives strong suppression .",
    "furthermore , the detection of @xmath79 is more difficult than @xmath80 , thus it could hardly be measured at the present two @xmath2 factories .",
    "the relations for the @xmath72 decay can be derived similarly using the effective hamiltonian which are also useful in searching for the @xmath7 mesons : @xmath81     meson production in @xmath10 decays . ]    as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the study of charmonium like states production in @xmath10 decays is easier .",
    "here we also consider the z(4430 ) particle production in @xmath10 decays . in this case , the spectator is a @xmath82 quark , thus the initial state is very simple : a singlet of flavor su(3 ) group .",
    "but the effective electro - weak hamiltonian can form an octet : @xmath83 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian at hadron level can be written by : @xmath84 where the non - zero elements of the transition hamiltonian are @xmath85 for ckm allowed channels @xmath86 and @xmath87 for ckm suppressed channels @xmath86 with a factor @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding feynmann diagrams are given in fig .",
    "[ diagram : zproductioninbc ] .",
    "the coefficients for distinct contributions are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : bcdecays ] .",
    "the ckm matrix element for the decay channels induced by @xmath86 is @xmath89 , which is in the same order with that of @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "thus without any other suppressions , these @xmath10 decays also have similar branching ratios ( @xmath92 ) with @xmath93 .",
    "the decays in the second part of tab .",
    "[ tab : bcdecays ] are suppressed by @xmath94 , which are expected to have smaller decay rates ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "furthermore , the su(3 ) symmetry implies the following relations : @xmath96     meson production via radiative decays .",
    "the right diagram gives a smaller contribution as at least one hard gluon is required . ]    besides non - leptonic @xmath2 decays , @xmath7 particles can also be produced in radiative decays , as fig .",
    "[ diagram : z - pro4 ] shows .",
    "two - body radiative decays can serve as a natural filter to exclude spin-0 candidates of z particles , as the photon can only be transversely polarized .",
    "but in order to predict the production rates , one has to know @xmath97 transition form factors .",
    "in the second diagram of fig .  [",
    "diagram : z - pro4 ] , in order to generate the @xmath98 , we require at least one hard gluon which will suppress the contribution from this diagram .",
    "navely thinking , the first diagram will also be suppressed by the off - shell @xmath99 quark propagator , but since the emitted photon is not energetic ( the total energy release is only about @xmath100 gev ) , the off - shellness is not large .",
    "this may imply the following radiative @xmath2 decays could go through with considerable rates : @xmath101",
    "in the above , we have utilized the flavor su(3 ) symmetry for light quarks in @xmath7 mesons .",
    "one can also replace one or two heavy @xmath99 quarks by heavier @xmath64 quarks which can predict @xmath103 and @xmath104 mesons @xcite .",
    "another attempt is to replace a light quark by a heavy @xmath99 quark . with this replacement ,",
    "we obtain three @xmath8 states which contain three heavy quarks and a light quark : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , together with their charge conjugates .",
    "we have to confess that this replacement may change the internal dynamics , but here we assume the same dynamics with @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", the masses can be obtained by using mass differences of @xmath99 and @xmath108 quarks deriving from masses of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the rough predictions for masses are around @xmath111 and @xmath112 mev . if these mesons are viewed as the resonance of @xmath109 and @xmath113 , their masses could be predicted as @xmath114 mev , @xmath114 mev and @xmath115 mev .",
    "because of the large mass of @xmath102 , these particles only appear in @xmath10 meson decays .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian responsible for non - leptonic decays is @xmath116 where the first contribution @xmath117 comes from the gluonic diagram shown as the first one in figure [ diagram : z - pro5 ] ; while the second term @xmath118 comes from the @xmath7-recoiling diagram shown as the second one in figure  [ diagram : z - pro5 ] .",
    "these two contributions give the following amplitudes for @xmath119 decays : @xmath120 the first 4 decay channels shown in eq.([28]-[30 ] ) are induced by @xmath121 at quark level and thus have branching ratios of order @xmath5 , while the other decays shown in eq.([31]-[33 ] ) are suppressed by @xmath122 , which have smaller decay rates ( @xmath95 ) .",

    "belle collaboration has reported a resonance named @xmath1 , which consists of at least four quarks in constituent quark model . in this note",

    ", we estimate the masses of these mesons .",
    "we investigate the production in non - leptonic @xmath71 decays by constructing the effective hamiltonian using flavor su(3 ) meson matrices .",
    "the transition at quark level is either @xmath121 or @xmath72 , where the former one is ckm favored and the latter is suppressed by @xmath122 . thus the considered non - leptonic decays have either similar branching ratios with the observed decay @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) or smaller branching ratios ( @xmath125 ) as shown in the text . utilizing the su(3 ) symmetry",
    ", we also obtain many relations for various decay channels .",
