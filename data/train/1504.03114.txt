    "over more than last three decades , there has been tremendous progress in the technology of cooling and trapping of single - electron alkali atomic gases and some two - electron atomic gases . in parallel , the developments in the technology of trapping and cooling of some ions , specially alkaline - earth cations over last several decades has led to new vistas of research activities with trapped and cold ions . with recent experimental developments @xcite using hybrid ion - atom traps @xcite",
    ", both atoms and ions can be confined simultaneously in a common space or an atom - trap can be merged with an ion - trap .",
    "these hybrid systems open up prospects for emulating solid - state physics with laser - generated periodic structure of ions @xcite and for exploring physics of ion - controlled josephson junction @xcite , tonk - girardeau gas with an ionic density `` bubble '' @xcite .    at a fundamental level , these new hybrid devices facilitate the laboratory investigations on ion - atom collisions in hitherto unexplored low energy regimes  from millikelvin down to microkelvin or sub - microkelvin temperature regime .",
    "ion - atom scattering at low energy is important for a number of physical systems , such as cold plasma , planetary atmospheres , interstellar clouds .",
    "gaining insight into the ion - atom interactions and scattering at ultra - low energy down to wigner threshold law regime is important to understand charge transport@xcite at low temperature , radiative association @xcite , ion - atom bound states@xcite , ion - atom photoassociation@xcite , and many other related phenomena .",
    "several theoretical investigations @xcite of atom - ion cold collisions have been carried out in recent times .",
    "it is proposed that controlled ion - atom cold collision can be utilized for quantum information processes@xcite .",
    "several recent theoretical studies have focused on charge - transfer @xcite and chemical reaction processes @xcite at ultralow energies between an alkaline - earth ion or yb@xmath2 and an alkali atom .",
    "ions are usually trapped by radio - frequency fields . the major hindrance to cool trapped",
    "ions below millikelvin temperature stems from the trap - induced micro - motion of the ions , which seems to be indispensable for such ion traps .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to achieve sub - microkelvin temperature for an ion - atom system in a hybrid trap .",
    "but , to explore fully quantum or wigner threshold law regime for ion - atom collisions , it is essential to reduce the temperature of ion - atom hybrid systems below one micro - kelvin .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to device new methods to trap and cool both ions and atoms in an optical trap . with recent experimental demonstration of an optical trap for ions@xcite",
    ", the prospect for experimental explorations of ultracold ion - atom collisions in wigner threshold regime appears to be promising .    in the contexts of ion - atom cold collisions of current interest , there are mainly four types of ion - atom systems:(1 ) an alkaline - earth ion interacting with an alkali metal atom , ( 2 ) a rare earth ion ( such as yb ) interacting with an alkali metal atom , ( 3 ) an alkali metal ion interacting with an alkali atom of the same nucleus and ( 4 ) an alkali metal ion interacting with an alkali atom of different nucleus . in the first two types , both the ion and the atom have one valence electron in the outermost shell . in the third type",
    ", the ion has closed shell structure while the atom has one valence electron in the outermost shell .",
    "since both the ion and atom are of the same nucleus , there is center of symmetry for the electronic wave function of the ion - atom pair . because of this symmetry , resonant charge transfer collision is possible in the third type . in the fourth type ,",
    "the ion is of closed shell structure while the atom has one valence electron in the outermost shell .",
    "since the nuclei of the atom and the ion are different , there is no resonant charge transfer collision in fourth type , though non - resonant charge transfer is possible in all the types . for scattering in the ground - state potentials ,",
    "non - resonant charge transfer collision is suppressed in the ultralow energy regime ( @xmath3k ) .",
    "+    , ( lics)@xmath0 and ( nacs)@xmath0,width=377 ]    here we study cold collision in the fourth type of ion - atom systems , though these systems are not straightforward to obtain experimentally . normally , neutral alkali - metal atoms and alkaline - earth ions can be laser - cooled and trapped .",
    "however , there are some recent experimental studies showing different techniques @xcite for trapping and cooling of closed - shell akali - metal ions .",
    "our primary aim is to understand ground - state elastic scattering processes between such an ion and an alkali atom of different nuclei at ultralow energy where inelastic charge transfer process can be ignored .",
    "a proper understanding of ground - state elastic scattering processes@xcite at low energy in an ion - atom system is important for exploring coherent control of ion - atom systems and formation of ultracold molecular ions by radiative processes . due to the absence of resonance charge transfer reaction ,",
    "the fourth type system is preferable for our purpose .",

    "the large discrepancies between the valence s results and our values can be explained by two reason .",
    "first , valence used the hellmann - type model where the hamiltonian is written in terms of one valence electron interacting with closed shell cores .",
    "therefore , the core - core interaction potentials were neglected .",
    "this is certainly true for large interatomic distances but it is not accurate enough for small separations .",
    "valence considered this shortcoming as not relevant to the charge exchange collision process they studied using the interaction potential where only intermediate and long - range distances are required .",
    "although , without considering the core - core interaction one can get correct asymptotic limits , at intermediate distance this will affect the accuracy of the equilibrium distance and well depth .",
    "second , the core - valence interactions were considered in our work using a formulation where , for each atom , the core polarization effects are described by an effective potential as described previously .",
    "the latter is modified by an @xmath59- dependent cut - off function @xmath60 to consider , in a different way the orbital symmetries . in the case of valence ,",
    "the hellmann pseudopotential is not `` @xmath59 '' dependent and the parameters are optimized to obtain the two first experimental energy levels .",
    "similarly , in the the absence of the core - core interaction , valence considered that this lack of `` @xmath59 '' dependence is not crucial for the charge exchange collision . in our approach , in addition to the use of an @xmath59-dependent pseudoptential the parameters were optimized to reproduce with high accuracy the ionization potential and the experimental energy levels of many alkali excited states .",
    "moreover , in our study , the interatomic separation grid is more extended as @xmath61 varies from 3 to 200 a.u . with a distance step of 0.1 a.u , but valence limited his calculation for internuclear distances ranging from 5 a.u . to 25 a.u .",
    "it is important to note that the calculation time in our calculation is enormously reduced due to the use of the pseudopotential approach that leads these ionic molecules to one - electron systems .",
    "calculations are performed on a desktop pentium iv acer computer where the time for one single distance is about 32 seconds .",
    "here we present results on elastic collisions of the discussed ion - atom systems by fortran code @xcite using the well - known numerov - cooley algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm provides an efficient technique for numerically solving a second order differential equation .",
    "it uses a three - point recursion relation to calculate first order derivative and makes use of exact second order derivative provided by the equation itself . to solve time - independent schroedinger equation as a scattering problem",
    ", one has to propagate the numerov - cooley code from initially small internuclear separation @xmath62 to asymptotically large @xmath62 where the wave function corresponds to the state of a free particle and so behaves sinusoidally .",
    "the scattering @xmath63-matrix is then deduced by matching the asymptotic solution with the standard scattering boundary conditions .",
    "the correctness of the calculations is ensured by the unitarity of the @xmath63-matrix .",
    "the lower the energy larger is the asymptotic boundary . to initiate the propagation of the code from @xmath64 position",
    ", one has to set initially the values of the wave functions at two initial positions , then the code calculates the wave function for the third position , and then taking the the values of the wave functions for the second and third position it calculates the wave function for the fourth position , and the process continues until the asymptotic boundary is reached .",
    "the initial boundary conditions are set by expanding the interaction potential for small @xmath62 and solving the schroedinger equation analytically for @xmath65 limit .",
    "a good measure for the asymptotic scattering boundary ( large @xmath62 ) can be found by setting the condition that the effective potential @xmath66 for large @xmath62 becomes much less than the collision energy @xmath29 ( at least one tenth of @xmath29 ) .",

    "since born - oppenheimer ion - atom potential goes as @xmath83 in the asymptotic limit , as @xmath84 , @xmath75-wave scattering cross section becomes independent of energy while all other higher partial - wave cross sections go as @xmath85 . as energy increases beyond the wigner threshold law regime , the @xmath75-wave cross section exhibits a minimum at a low energy which may be related to ramsauer - townsend effect .",
    "it can be noticed from figure 3 that at ramsauer minimum of @xmath75-wave scattering , @xmath20- and @xmath21-wave elastic cross sections are finite .",
    "this means that one can explore @xmath20- or @xmath21-wave interactions of ion - atom systems at the minimum position that occurs at a relatively low energy ( @xmath17- and milli - kelvin regime ) .    in the wigner threshold regime ,",
    "hetero - nuclear ion - atom collisions are dominated by elastic scattering processes since the charge transfer reactions are highly suppressed in this energy regime .",
    "furthermore , resonant charge transfer collisions do not arise in collision of an ion with an atom of different nucleus .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the elastic scattering results of hetero - nuclear alkai ion - atom system to those of homo - nuclear alkali atom - ion system na+na@xmath0 @xcite . by comparing our results in figure 3 with the figures 2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we notice that elastic scattering cross sections of both homo- and hetero - nuclear ion - atom systems at ultralow energies are comparable and primarily governed by winger threshold laws . however , unlike hetero - nuclear systems , the resonant charge transfer cross section in homo - nuclear na+na@xmath0 is also of the same order as that of elastic one at ultra - low energies .",
    "resonant charge exchange cold collisions between yb and yb@xmath0 are experimentally observed and found to be a dominant process in this homo - nuclear system @xcite .    in figure 4 , we have plotted logarithm of total elastic scattering cross sections ( @xmath86 ) expressed in a.u . as a function of logarithm of @xmath29 in k for ground state collisions between li and cs@xmath0 and between na and cs@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "for both ( lics)@xmath0 and ( nacs)@xmath0 , to calculate @xmath86 , we require more than 60 partial waves to get converging results for energies greater than 1 mk .",
    "this is because , as the collision energy increases , more and more partial waves start to contribute to @xmath86 . in order for a particular partial wave @xmath68 to contribute appreciably at a given energy @xmath29",
    ", the centrifugal barrier height corresponding to this partial wave should not be too high compared to the energy .",
    "an estimate of the minimum number of partial waves required for obtaining convergent results may be made by taking the height of the centrifugal barrier to be higher than the energy by one order of magnitude . in this context",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the centrifugal barrier height for a partial wave of an ion - atom system is usually much lower than the corresponding height of atom - atom system , therefore larger number of partial waves contribute to @xmath86 in case of an ion - atom system . in the large energy limit",
    ", the cross section behaves as @xmath87    thus , in the large energy regime the slope of the logarithm of @xmath86 as a function of @xmath88 is a straight line obeying the equation @xmath89 where the slope of the line is @xmath90 and the intercept of the line on the energy axis is solely determined by the @xmath32 coefficient of long - range part of the potential , or equivalently by the characteristic length scale @xmath35 of the potentials or the polarizability of the neutral atom interacting with the ion . as shown in figure 4 , we have numerically verified this e@xmath91 law for both li - cs@xmath0 and na - cs@xmath0 systems .",
    "the linear fit to the the plot of numerically calculated @xmath86 against in the large energy regime shows that the value of the slope is quite close to the actual value of 1/3 .",
    "since the dipole polarizability of li and na is not much different , one can expect that for both li - cs@xmath0 and na - cs@xmath0 systems , the energy - dependence of @xmath86 at large energy should be similar .",
    "in fact , figure 4 shows that for energies much greater 1 @xmath17k , both systems exhibit similar asymptotic energy dependence .",
    "li + rb@xmath0 ( 1@xmath13 ) and @xmath51li + rb@xmath0 ( 1@xmath13 ) collision are plotted as a function of e ( in k ) for @xmath68 = 0 ( solid ) and @xmath68 = 1 ( dashed ) in upper and lower panel , respectively.,width=350 ]    finally , we consider the collision of @xmath92rb@xmath0 with the two isotopes of li atom , namely , @xmath37li and @xmath51li , and the results are shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the purpose here is to investigate the isotopic effects of li on low energy collisions with @xmath92rb@xmath0 ion . in figure 5",
    "we have plotted logarithm ( to the base of 10 ) of @xmath86 as a function of logarithm ( to the base of 10 ) of e. results clearly show that the patterns are same for @xmath37li and @xmath51li colliding with @xmath92rb@xmath0 , but they differ in magnitudes , particularly in the low energy regime .",
    "figure 6 exhibits the variation of @xmath75- and @xmath20-wave scattering cross sections against energy in log - log scale for both isotopes of li colliding with rb@xmath0 .",
    "again , the results are qualitatively similar for both the isotopes , but they differ slightly quantitatively . comparing the upper and lower panels in figure 6 ,",
    "one can notice that the wigner threshold law regime for @xmath37li can be attained at slightly higher energy than that for @xmath51li .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied elastic scattering between alkali ion and alkali atom of different nuclei of three ion - atom systems , namely , li + cs@xmath0 , na + cs@xmath0 , and li + rb@xmath0 .",
    "we have calculated the interaction potentials and spectroscopic constants of these systems .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of elastic collision physics over a wide range of energies , showing the onset of wigner threshold regime at ultra low energy and the 1/3 law of scattering at higher energy regime .",
    "the low energy scattering results presented here may be useful for future exploration for radiative- or photo - associative formation of cold diatomic molecular ions from these three ion - atom systems .",
    "the colliding ground state atom - ion pair corresponding to the continuum of 1@xmath13 may be photoassociated to form a bound state in second excited potential 3@xmath13 by using a laser of appropriate frequency .",
    "this is promising because the transition is dipole allowed and is similar to atomic transition .",
    "the formation of such cold molecular ions by radiative processes will pave new directions to ultracold chemistry .",
