    "a system with @xmath14 is in general chaotic , i.e. , the solution to eq.([eqn : grav ] ) is known to be sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "miller ( 1964 ) was the first to show that individual orbits calculated from neighbouring initial configurations diverge on a short time - scale proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean time between two subsequent close encounters of a particle .",
    "even when computed with double precision arithmetic , the differences between the two integrations become comparable to the characteristic length- and velocity - scales of the cluster within only a few crossing times .",
    "thus one may argue that the positions and velocities obtained from an @xmath0-body simulation are a fair rendition of the problem at hand in a statistical sense only ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite identify three mechanisms responsible for the exponential growth of the distance between nearby trajectories . aside from numerical errors , they point out that the exponential instability of the solutions also arises through a fluctuating mean gravitational field , or through inherently chaotic orbits in a static field .",
    "however , for systems in dynamical equilibrium and with near - spherical symmetry ( such as e.g. globular clusters ) , they conclude that the principal mechanism responsible for chaos is the cumulative effect of near neighbour interactions , i.e. two - body encounters .",
    "+ the exponential divergence of the @xmath0-body problem of eq.([eqn : grav ] ) has been studied by several authors for systems with up to @xmath17 particles ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the debate whether miller s instability is formally caused by chaos is still on - going ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the assumed chaoticity of such systems may be evaluated by computing the variational equations associated to eq.([eqn : grav ] ) @xcite and by retrieving indicators of chaos such as , for instance , lyapunov characteristic numbers @xcite .",
    "other indicators of chaos commonly found in the literature are e.g. , the relative lyapunov indicator @xcite , the mean exponential divergence of nearby orbits @xcite or the small - alignment index @xcite .",
    "all these indicators accurately quantify the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "+ in this work , we propose to investigate time - dependent orbital complexity in an @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "we define orbital complexity to be a measure of the richness and non - triviality of the frequency spectrum of an orbit at a given time @xmath18 .",
    "the possible connection between orbital chaos and orbital complexity has been pointed out by @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors find a strong correlation between their measure of orbital complexity and short time lyapunov exponents .",
    "the notion of complexity provides information about the orbital content of a gravitational system governed by eq.([eqn : grav ] ) that is complementary to the classical indicators of chaos mentioned above .",
    "for instance , the concept of complexity is exploited by @xcite to study the continuum limit in the case of large-@xmath0 simulations .",
    "it is used to compare the orbital behavior between particles evolving in smooth potentials and bodies orbiting in the corresponding frozen @xmath0-body configurations .",
    "the notion of complexity here allows to contrast the discreteness effects of the @xmath0-body configuration to the orbital evolution obtained in the smooth case .",
    "however , whereas a global measure of orbital complexity has been implemented in several works ( see e.g. , kandrup et al .",
    "1997 ) , a method to measure the impact of instantaneous changes in orbital complexity has not . a trajectory computed from eq.([eqn : grav ] )",
    "can show multiple , qualitatively distinct regimes in time .",
    "for instance , an orbit may display arcs of relatively smooth motion such as e.g. , an unperturbed parabolic or hyperbolic orbit . at other times , the body may be gravitationally bound in a binary system with a particle of approximately the same mass .",
    "likewise , the body may be temporarily trapped in a complicated higher - order resonance , orbiting about a massive central body .",
    "all these states of motion can be identified in time by a suitable measure of complexity .",
    "the goal of this paper is precisely to discuss such time - resolved complexity by introducing a dedicated tool for complexity evaluation .",
    "the issue of formally relating complexity to chaos will not be addressed here . + classical spectral methods and fourier transform based techniques",
    "( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are of short execution time and able to provide an accurate frequency domain representation of a given orbit .",
    "a global measure of complexity can be retrieved by such an approach .",
    "however , the fourier transform suffers from the problem of losing any time - dependent information on the motion of the particle . in this paper",
    ", we present an accurate , easy - to - implement and time - resolved complexity - detection tool for individual orbits in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "a state of dynamical equilibrium is assumed throughout .",
    "we implement a specially - adapted method of time series analysis that is based on a discrete wavelet transform . the method post - processes the orbital data of a simulation and provides a time - resolved measure of complexity .",
    "the present work mainly focuses on a detailed description of the method and is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the identification technique for time - dependent complexity .",
    "section 3 presents applications to @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21-body problems .",

    "this section presents and tests a technique to quantify time - dependent orbital complexity . in  [ subsect : dwt ] , we present the discrete wavelet transform ( hereafter dwat ) as an efficient tool to determine the base frequencies of an orbit in a time - resolved manner .",
    "the indicator of complexity obtained from the dwat , namely the discrete wavelet transform information measure ( dwatim ) , is defined in  [ subsect : complexity ] .",
    "the complexity of motion is analyzed by means of a wavelet transform ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the use of wavelet transforms has found applications in a wide range of domains such as seismology , financial time series processing or medical electrocardiogram studies ; see @xcite for further references .",
    "a wavelet transform provides a time - frequency representation of a time series @xmath23 by fitting a wavelet @xmath24 to a set of points @xmath25 .",
    "whereas fourier - based methods decompose a signal into infinite sine and cosine functions , effectively losing information at individual times @xmath26 , the wavelet transform offers precise localization in both the frequency- and time - domain .",
    "wavelet transforms remain band - limited however ; they are made up of not one but a limited range of several frequencies .    a wavelet family @xmath27 is defined by the set of elemental functions generated by scaling and translating a mother wavelet @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the scale variable and @xmath31 the translation variable ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) is defined as the correlation between a signal @xmath33 ( the space of square summable functions ) and the wavelet family @xmath34 for each @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the wavelet coefficients and @xmath37 is the complex conjugate of @xmath24 . equation ( [ eqn : cwt ] ) can be inverted to reconstruct the original time series .",
    "the cwt is known to produce a large amount of wavelet coefficients which implies considerable cpu execution times ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the information the cwt displays at closely spaced scales or at closely spaced time points is highly correlated and thus unnecessarily redundant .    for these reasons we instead compute a _",
    "discrete _ wavelet transform ( dwat ) .",
    "the dwat offers a highly efficient wavelet representation that can be implemented with a simple recursive filter scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . unlike the numerical cwt implementation which easily produces more than @xmath38 coefficients for a single orbital time series of @xmath39 data points , the dwat only produces as many coefficients as there are samples in the time series , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "this property of the dwat of avoiding redundant wavelet coefficients serves in defining a proper measure of complexity , as we will show in  [ subsect : complexity ] . for a given choice of the mother wavelet function @xmath28 and for the discrete set of parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45 )",

    "@xmath53 is the reconstructed signal and @xmath54 is the number of scales over which the time series @xmath23 is analyzed . the dwat coefficients @xmath55 can be understood as a representation of the wavelet power spectrum ( or , energy ) at scale @xmath43 and time @xmath26 , associated to the time series @xmath23 .",
    "they represent the local residual errors between successive signal approximations at scales @xmath43 and @xmath56 .",
    "in what follows , we set @xmath57 for a more convenient notation of the dwat coefficients .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there are @xmath40 coefficients @xmath58 and the number of coefficients computed for resolution level @xmath43 is @xmath59 .",

    "* and  13.10 ) ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details about the wavelet representation .",
    "we use bi - orthogonal cubic spline functions as mother wavelets ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* case @xmath64 in their table 6.1 ) ) , @xmath65 where the @xmath66 s are known as basic spline coefficients and @xmath67 this choice is motivated by three arguments .",
    "first and most importantly , spline functions provide an excellent time - frequency localization when compared to other mother wavelet candidates ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "instantaneous changes in the dynamics are accurately singled out by the dwat .",
    "we further stress this point in  [ subsect : toy_model ] .",
    "second , the use of splines is computationally inexpensive @xcite and provides further desirable properties such as e.g. , compact support and smoothness .",
    "( for an exhaustive discussion on spline interpolation , see @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "finally , the use of a bi - orthogonal spline mother wavelet also implies reduced border effects , an undesired artifact of the wavelet transform algorithm ( see  [ subsubsect : bfx ] below ) .",
    "we analyze the velocity time series @xmath68",
    "i.e. the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 velocity components of each particle @xmath11 @xmath72 . we do not use the information available on the positions of the bodies since there may be important differences in magnitude between the beginning and the end of these time series .",

    "such border effects depend on the values held by the two end points of the data vector , and may become important when both ends of the data set differ greatly . in the following ,",
    "we aim to quantify the extent to which the diagnostics become erroneous due to these edge effects .",

    "for both sinusoids a maximum intensity is obtained for the scale that represents the base period @xmath79 of the respective signal .",

    "the region in which the discrete wavelet transform of @xmath73 suffers from border effects is known as the cone of influence ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cone of influence is clearly visible at both edges on fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](c ) . on the left - hand edge of fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](c ) , for example , the dwat gives an artificially high excited mode at scale @xmath83 up to @xmath84 .",
    "the same artifact is also found at scales of higher frequencies , although the magnitude of the effect then diminishes and is barely visible on the left - hand side of fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](c ) .",
    "in addition , scale @xmath82 is wrongly excited in the intervals @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the size of the cone of influence depends on the choice of the mother wavelet and is especially significant when the spectrum of the signal contains low frequencies , when the period compares to the overall duration of the time series ( moortel et al .",
    "2004 ) . + figure [ fig : sinusoid_bfx](d ) shows a situation where the border effects have been reduced by extending the integration time to twice the original interval data vector may also be padded with zeros until twice the original time interval is reached . ] . doubling the time interval of analysis implies an increased ratio between the signal length and its periodicity .",
    "this allows for a higher resolution in the frequency domain ( carmona et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore , a larger portion of the dwat remains unaffected by the border discontinuity and thus a larger amount of reliable information can be retrieved . in particular , the left - hand and the right - hand border effects are diminished on fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](d ) : for instance , the wrongly excited mode at @xmath83 between @xmath87 in fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](c ) has been reduced by @xmath88 and the scale @xmath82 artifacts of the right - hand side of that figure have vanished completely . in the remainder of this paper , we apply the technique of time series extension whenever the edge effects appear significant . to take into account the remaining artifacts at the beginning of the time series , we furthermore analyze the first @xmath89 data points ( equivalent to the first @xmath90 of the signal ) of the dwat analysis with particular caution .",
    "although fig.[fig : sinusoid_bfx](d ) indicates that border effects may influence more than the first 25% of the @xmath73 analysis , we found that this is in general not the case for signals produced by @xmath0-body orbits ( see  [ subsubsect : sinusoid_complexity ] and  [ sect : few - body ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we refer to these 25% of the analysis as potentially biased due to border effects .",
    "our goal is to obtain from the dwat a quantitative estimate of the time - dependent complexity of the frequency spectrum of a trajectory .",
    "exploiting some notions of information theory , we here present the discrete wavelet transform information measure ( dwatim ) as an efficient indicator for complexity . in",
    "what follows , we provide a succinct overview of the concept .",

    "+ we opted for a dwatim implementation that allowed 1 ) to identify qualitative changes in orbital dynamics in a quasi - instantaneous manner and 2 ) to provide a continuous quantification of time - dependent complexity on a well - defined gauge between @xmath104 and @xmath141 .",
    "one should however bear in mind that an _",
    "absolute _ measure of complexity of a dynamical system can not be obtained by the method .",
    "complexity ultimately depends on the range of scales over which the system is studied .",
    "the dwatim is a band - limited measure and therefore strongly depends on the resolution of the time series that is subjected to analysis .",
    "experience drawn from several test cases shows that a repeat calculation with truncated frequency range is desirable to confirm the convergence of the diagnostics .",
    "+ border effects are an unwanted artifact of the wavelet transform . in order to reduce the bias",
    "so introduced we opted to implement a _",
    "discrete _ wavelet transform and to select cubic spline functions as mother wavelets .",
    "this dwat implementation avoids redundant wavelet coefficients .",
    "this helps in obtaining a proper measure of complexity for the two limiting cases of a unique base frequency sinusoid ( dwatim = 0 ) and of a white noise signal ( dwatim =  1 ) , and thus to recover a well - defined gauge of complexity .",
    "we obtain reliable diagnostics of complexity whenever the orbit is integrated over a minimum of @xmath305 complete oscillations ( see  [ subsect : pyth ] ) .",
    "the method is computationally inexpensive .",
    "for example , the analysis of a time series of length @xmath346 data points takes approximately @xmath141 second on a pentium iv 2.4 ghz workstation with 1.2 gb ram memory .",
    "it is then possible to obtain a complexity diagnostic of an @xmath347 body system in about @xmath348 processor - hours .",
    "a parallel implementation of the scheme is currently under development .",
