    "it is widely realized now that hard _ multiple parton interactions _ ( mpi ) occur with a probability of the order one in typical inelastic lhc proton - proton @xmath1 collisions and hence play an important role in the description of inelastic @xmath1 collisions .",
    "mpi were first introduced in the eighties @xcite and in the last decade became a subject of a number of the theoretical studies , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "also , in the past several years a number of double parton scattering ( dps ) measurements in different channels in the central rapidity kinematics were carried out @xcite , while many monte carlo ( mc ) event generators now incorporate mpis .",
    "it was pointed out starting with @xcite that the rate of dps can be calculated through the integral over the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) under assumption that partons are not correlated and double gpd is simply a product of single gpds .",
    "information about gpds at small x is available from the analyses of the hera @xcite .",
    "based on these analyses it was demonstrated that the uncorrelated model predicts the dps rates which are a factor @xmath2 2 too low to explain the data , hence indicating presence of significant parton - parton correlations .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that correlations generated in the course of the dglap evolution  2 mechanism ",
    "explain the dps rates in the central rapidity region @xcite provided the starting scale for the qcd evolution ",
    "@xmath3 is chosen .",
    "the role of 2 mechanism decreases however once we move to smaller @xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand as it was explained in @xcite with the decrease of @xmath0 the relative importance of soft correlations in the nucleon increases .",
    "these correlations lead to a non - factorizable initial conditions for the evolution of double gpd at initial scale @xmath4 . in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we presented a simple way to take into account these correlations for the forward kinematics recently studied by lhcb which corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "the method is based on the connection between the correlation contribution to the mpi and inelastic diffraction @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that taking into account the mean field 2 contribution , 2 contribution and soft correlations leads to a good description of the dps data in the forward lhcb kinematics @xcite .",
    "( these data are the most accurate data to date on the dps and have the smallest background from the leading twist processes ) .",
    "moreover it was pointed out that the account of the soft correlations leads to a strong reduction of the predicted @xmath6 on the incident energy and @xmath7 of a minijet , and to @xmath6 being approximately constant for minijets contributing to the underlying event ( ue ) @xcite.moreover , including soft correlations have led to a significant reduction of the sensitivity of the results to the value of the parameter @xmath4 separating soft and hard correlations @xcite .",
    "naturally , it will be interesting to check the consequences of the soft correlations model developed in @xcite for the central kinematics at the lhc relevant for cms and atlas experiments to clarify the role of soft correlations in this kinematics .",
    "hence in this paper we will extend the model of @xcite to the central kinematics , and quantify the role of the soft correlations in central kinematics .",
    "we shall see that for large transverse scales ( @xmath8 gev ) dps , considered in @xcite , they constitute a small correction with dominant correlations originating from the perturbative 2 mechanism . at the same time we find that soft correlations are important for the few gev transverse scales corresponding to ue , leading to a weak dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath9 for @xmath9 of the order several gev followed by a decrease of @xmath6 at @xmath10 gev largely due to the 2 contribution . also ,",
    "similar to the case of the forward kinematics inclusion of the soft contribution makes the result less sensitive to the different initial scales @xmath4 .    for simplicity we will limit our analysis to production of four jets in the gluon interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the results of our previous analyses of the 2,2 mechanisms in the central kinematics .",
    "in section 3 we discuss the soft correlations , and in section 4 investigate their role numerically .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",

    "one can parameterize gpds as d_1(x , q^2,)=d(x , q^2 ) f_2g(,x).[slon1 ] here @xmath13 is the conventional gluon pdf of the nucleon , and @xmath14 is the two gluon nucleon form factor . the effective cross section",

    "hence we find for the mean field value of @xmath6 at the lhc energies in the central kinematics @xmath21 , @xmath22 drops from @xmath23 43 mb at @xmath24 to @xmath23 37 mb @xmath25 due to the increase of @xmath0 with increase of @xmath26 and increase of the transverse area occupied by gluons with decrease of @xmath0 , cf .",

    "1a leads to the enhancement of the rate of dps ( increase of @xmath28 ) as compared to its mean field value .",
    "the 2 mechanism was suggested in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that taking into account the pqcd dglap ladder splittings leads to a decrease of @xmath6 .",
    "we calculate @xmath29 - the ratio of the contributions of 2 and mean field mechanisms by solving by iterations the evolution equation for @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the enhancement coefficient @xmath29 for ( here @xmath31 includes 2 and 2 mechanisms ) are summarized in fig .",
    "there is an additional contribution to the dps at small @xmath0 which was first discussed in @xcite , and in more detail in @xcite which is related to the soft dynamics .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that soft dynamics leads to positive correlations between partons at small @xmath0 which have to be included in the calculation of the dps cross section .",
    "these soft correlations can be calculated using the connection between mpi and inelastic diffraction .",
    "this non - factorized contribution to @xmath33gpd is calculated at the initial scale @xmath34 that separates soft and hard physics and which we consider as the starting scale for the dglap evolution .",

    "we determine @xmath44 and @xmath45 from the hera data @xcite for the ratio of inelastic and elastic diffraction at @xmath46 : = 0.25 0.05 , and from analysis of diffraction for large @xmath0 carried in @xcite , which shows that @xmath47    we are considering here relatively low energies ( relative large @xmath0 ) and a rather modest energy interval .",
    "hence we neglect energy dependence of @xmath44 .",
    "numerically , we obtain @xmath48 for @xmath49 gev@xmath43 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 gev@xmath43 , using the pomeron intercept values given below .",
    "note that the intercept of the pomeron that splits into 2 ( region between 2 blobs in fig .",
    "4 ) is always 1.1 for @xmath46 , i.e. this pomeron is by definition soft , and the intercept of reggeon is 0.5 .",
    "note that in @xcite we used the model that contained only dominant pomeron component .",
    "here we need to consider both pomeron and reggeon contributions , since we need to go to larger @xmath0 and smaller diffractive masses .",
    "hence we need to take into account the reggeon contribution which gives dominant contribution to diffraction for small diffractive masses .",
    "hence the value of @xmath44 here is slightly different from the one in @xcite .",

    "we used the model of @xcite to study nonperturbative parton - parton correlations in the central kinematics at the lhc .",

    "nevertheless , our results indicate a number of basic features of soft nonperturbative parton - parton correlations relevant for the central lhc dynamics , relevant for atlas , cms and alice detectors .",
    "\\(i ) we see that for large transverse momenta , relevant for hard dps scattering , soft effects are small and essentially negligible , contributing only @xmath78 to the enhancement coefficient r if we start from the scale @xmath68 gev@xmath43 , and @xmath79 from 1 gev , for @xmath80 gev .",
    "thus they do not influence detailed hard dps studies carried in @xcite .",
    "moreover figs . 5 - 8",
    "show that characteristic transverse momentum @xmath81 , for which soft correlations constitute given fixed part of enhancement r rapidly increase with s. in other words the characteristic transverse scales for which soft correlations are important , rapidly increase with energy .",
    "\\(ii ) the soft non - factorisable contributions may contribute significantly in the underlying event dynamics , especially at the scales 2 - 4 gev where they are responsible for about 50% of the difference between mean field result and full prediction for @xmath82 for 0.5 gev@xmath43 case , and are dominant up to 4 gev if we start evolution from 1 gev .",

    "if we use 0.5 gev@xmath43 as a start of the evolution , and take @xmath83 gev , changes from 43 mb ( mean field value ) to 26 mb , while if we neglect soft correlations the change from mean field value is to 33 mb ( for @xmath84 tev ) .",
    "similarly if we start evolution at 1 gev , the change is to 27 mb , instead of 39 mb , if only pqcd effects are included .",

    "the results show that in ue significantly decreases as compared to the values one obtains including only contributions of the mean field and 2 mechanism .",
    "thus for the 2 - 4 gev scales , the full value of that includes soft correlations is 26 - 27 mb , instead of 30 - 39 mb that we find with only pqcd and mean field contributions included .",

    "it changes marginally between 3.5 tev and 6.5 tev collision energies for the same transverse scale for small @xmath7 .",
    "in other words the increase of soft correlations compensates the decrease of the relative pqcd contribution with an increase of energy ( i.e. decrease of effective @xmath86 in the process ) .",
    "overall we conclude that soft correlations do not influence significantly hard dps dynamics , but are important for the description of mpi in the ue regime .",
    "note also that inclusion of the soft correlations decreases the difference between @xmath87 obtained while carrying evolution from @xmath68 and @xmath88 gev@xmath43 scales , especially for small transverse scales of several gev .",
    "our results do not influence our previous results for dps scattering in the tevatron @xcite , where soft correlations give only @xmath89 contribution , since the corresponding region of @xmath0 is @xmath90 .",
    "this os in accoradance with increase pf characteristic momenta where soft correlations cease to be important with energy mentioned above .    finally note that an attempt to include soft correlations , also based on the ideas of @xcite was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "our results differ from numerical results of @xcite since the authors of @xcite : 1 ) used the scale @xmath91 instead of @xmath9 in their calculations .",
    "2 ) overestimated the mean field approach contributions , 3 ) used the starting scale of the dglap evolution of e @xmath92 gev@xmath43 , thus missing part of perturbative evolution .",
    "in addition , we used the effective values for reggeon parameters in the spirit of estimates in @xcite , and grv gluon densities for the pomeron , while the latter authors used a version of the full reggeon field theory with screenings .",
