    "open clusters ( ocs ) are an important population of the disc of our galaxy and may be used to trace its properties ( e.g. , spiral structure , kinematics , age and age distribution , metallicity , etc ; see @xcite for a review ) . in particular , by studying the old component of the oc population we may be able to trace the disc properties at all epochs since its formation , and to derive its evolution .",
    "the number of known  and well studied ",
    "old ocs has steadily grown in recent years ; what we still miss is a populous sample analyzed in a complete and homogeneous way to derive the cluster properties like membership , age , distance , reddening , and ( detailed ) chemical abundances using both photometric and low- and high - resolution spectroscopic data .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a project devoted to precise and homogeneous derivation of the fundamental properties of a large and well chosen sample of old open clusters .",
    "the goal of our project is to get insight on the formation and chemical enrichment mechanisms of the galactic disc .",
    "a description of the motivations of our program , and a status report of its photometric part are given in @xcite .",
    "as part of this project , we present here a study of berkeley  32 ( be  32 ) , an old anticentre open cluster , with coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "we have obtained medium resolution spectra of about 50 stars to derive the membership , as we have recently done for berkeley 29 @xcite , while @xmath9 ccd images are used to derive age , distance , reddening , and approximate metallicity .",
    "the cluster has already been studied by several authors .",
    "@xcite obtained low - resolution spectra and measured radial velocities of 14 stars , finding that 10 of them were cluster members and obtaining an average velocity of 101 km  s@xmath2 , with an error of 10 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these velocities were adopted also by @xcite , who determined metallicities - with an individual error of about 0.1 dex - and found an average [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath11 and washington photometry of be  32 ; combining different methods , like the morphological age ratio ( see sect .",
    "3 ) , the comparison to well studied clusters like ngc  188 and m  67 , and main sequence fitting , they determined that be  32 has an age of about 6 gyr , a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , reddening = 0.16 , and distance modulus @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite , working with @xmath14 data , reached similar conclusions ; they employed isochrone fitting and red clump luminosity to derive an age of 6.3 gyr , [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , = 0.08 , and true distance modulus @xmath16 .",
    "finally , @xcite observed be  32 ( that they indicate with the alternative name of biurakan 8) as part of a survey of 14 anticentre clusters ; their @xmath17 photometry is of somewhat lower quality , and results they derive from isochrone fitting and morphological parameter indicators are not in perfect agreement , but they confirm that be  32 is among the oldest ocs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : observations and reductions are described in section 2 , the cmds are presented in section 3 , together with results on isochrone fitting ; the radial velocities and memberships are derived in section 4 ; a summary can be found in section 5 .     exposure on be  32 ( 9.4 @xmath18 9.4 arcmin@xmath19 ) .",

    "most stars falling out of the main features are contaminating field objects , but there are a few ones , brighter than the to and bluer than the rgb , that may instead be blue stragglers ; they are worth of further examination .",

    "we obtain @xmath51 2.3 and @xmath52 0.65 ; these figures have an attached uncertainty of about 0.1 mag , since the actual to and rc points are difficult to locate in a diagram contaminated by field stars ( even if we were helped by the membership information of selected stars ) .",
    "they translate into ages of about 6 gyr using the mai , and between 5 and 7 gyr using the original @xcite and the revised @xcite calibrations of the mar , respectively .",
    "our measure is in good agreement with the age derived both from morphological age parameters and isochrone fitting by @xcite .",
    "this has to be taken as a first indication of the cluster age , but is substantiated also by the results by @xcite .",
    "they calibrated a similar method , that makes also use of information on the metallicity ; using the literature values of @xmath50 = 2.4 and [ fe / h]=@xmath530.50 , they derived a very similar age of 5.91 gyr .",
    "we have fitted our data with isochrones , using the models of @xcite , since they come from the same set of evolutionary tracks that we have already successfully used in our works ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we tried three different values of metallicity , z = 0.02 ( i.e. , solar abundance ) , z = 0.008 ( corresponding to [ fe / h ] @xmath54 ) and z = 0.004 ( corresponding to [ fe / h ] @xmath55 ) .",
    "the first and last sets of isochrones did not fit well our data , while isochrones with z = 0.008 provided a good fit .",
    "this is in agreement with the most recent determination of the cluster metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath530.50 @xcite .",
    "the results of the best fit , obtained with = 0.10 , = 12.48 and age = 6.3 gyr ( and z=0.008 ) , are shown in fig .",

    ".    an independent estimate of the distance has been derived by an empirical comparison of the rc in be  32 with the rc level in open clusters with similar properties and well established distance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "we chose as template cluster mel66 , an open cluster for which @xcite reports [ fe / h ]  @xmath56 and an age 4.5 gyr , hence quite similar to be  32 .",
    "since the metallicities of be  32 and mel66 are indistinguishable within the uncertainties , there is no need to correct for the dependence of the rc luminosity on metallicity .",
    "instead , we applied a small correction for population effects to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 luminosity of the rc assuming that be  32 is 2 gyr older than mel66 , and using the calculations of @xcite .",
    "the correction is of the order 0.07 mag ( for @xmath57 ) and implies luminosities @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the red clump of be  32 .    with this population correction , and",
    "assuming a reddening  @xmath60 from our isochrone fit , we obtained an extinction - corrected distance modulus @xmath61 using @xmath62 and @xmath63 from @xmath64 , where the errors mainly reflect the uncertainty on the reddening .",
    "these results do not differ very much from the literature ones ( see introduction ) .",
    "we defer any further comparison until a refinement of our results is obtained using a synthetic cmd technique .",
    "the cmd of the external field appears to be composed by ( at least ) two populations : a broad young main sequence of field stars , crossing diagonally the diagram , and a second more concentrated sequence fainter and bluer than the be  32 main sequence .",
    "the latter does not seem , at first sight , completely ascribable to the `` normal '' disc population , as described , e.g. , by the besanon galactic model by @xcite .",
    "a thorough discussion is beyond the purposes of the present paper ( and the possibilities of our data ) , but we consider it useful to further check whether we could be seeing some extra - disc component .",
    "given the position of our field ( @xmath7 , @xmath65 ) and the distances involved we can not have intercepted directly the monoceros ring ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this feature of the galactic disc has also been suggested ( @xcite ) to be associated to an over density in star counts that could represent the remnant of a dwarf galaxy ( canis major , cma ) . while the existence of the ring itself is not disputed , the reality of cma has however been challenged , for instance , by @xcite who attribute the over density to the galactic warp .",

    "[ fig - ring](c ) ] .",
    "all cmds have been scaled to absolute magnitudes and dereddened colours by correcting for the values given in the caption .",
    "the apparently better agreement between the cmds in panels ( a ) and ( b ) suggests that we might be seeing a portion of the disrupting cma ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to say something more definitive , further investigations would be required , involving e.g. precise radial velocities of lower ms stars , to be compared to the ones that are being derived in the direction of cma and of several ring positions . as indicated in the next section , our field stars have an average rv of about 43 km  s@xmath2 ( with an rms of 28 km  s@xmath2 ) , similar to that of the disc stars in the same direction , as deduced from the besanon model ( 33 km  s@xmath2 , with an rms of 28 )",
