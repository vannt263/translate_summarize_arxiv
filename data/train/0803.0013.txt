    "entanglement is the hallmark as well as most counterintuitive feature of quantum mechanics . among various ways to quantify entanglement , bipartite block entanglement entropy emerged as a concept of central importance in quantum information science@xcite , and has been receiving growing attention in other branches of physics recently .",
    "for example , it was suggested to be a possible source of black hole entropy@xcite . in condensed matter or many - body physics ,",
    "the entanglement entropy has been increasingly used as a very useful and in some cases indispensable way to characterize phases and phase transitions , especially in strongly correlated phases@xcite . in this context",
    "the most important result is perhaps the so - called area law@xcite , which states that in the thermodynamic limit , the entropy should be proportional to the area of the boundary that divides the system into two blocks .",
    "there are a few very important examples@xcite in which the area law is violated , most of which involve quantum criticality@xcite ; the specific manner with which the area law is violated is tied to certain universal properties of the phase or critical point . in some other cases , important information about the phase can be revealed by studying the leading _ correction _ to the area law@xcite ; for example this is the case for topologically ordered phases@xcite .",
    "comparatively there have been relatively few studies of the behavior of entanglement entropy in states with traditional long - range order@xcite .",
    "this is perhaps because of the expectation that ordered states can be well described by mean - field theory , and in mean - field theory the states reduce to simple product states that have no entanglement . in particular in the limit of perfect long - range order",
    "the mean - field theory becomes  exact \" , and the entanglement entropy should vanish . in this paper",
    "we will show that this is _ not _ the case , and interesting entanglement exists in states with perfect long - range order .",
    "we will study two exactly solvable spin-1/2 models : ( i ) an unfrustrated antiferromagnet with infinite range ( or constant ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interaction between spins in opposite sublattices , and ferromagnetic ( fm ) interaction between spins in the same sublattice ; ( ii ) an ordinary spin-1/2 ferromagnet with arbitrary fm interaction among the spins@xcite .",
    "while the ground states have perfect long - range order for both models , we show that they both have non - zero entanglement entropy that grow logarithmically with the size of the subsystem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model ( i ) and present its exact solution . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the reduced density matrix of a subsystem to obtain the exact expression of the entanglement entropy for model ( i ) . based on those results , in sec .",
    "iv we study the scaling behavior of the entropy as the system size tends to infinity under two different partition limits and compare it with numerical calculations .",
    "section v is devoted to model ( ii ) . finally , in sec . vi we summarize and discuss the results of this paper .",
    "some mathematical definitions , notations and details are given in the appendices .",
    "we consider a lattice model composed of two sublattices interpenetrating each other as in fig . [ fig.lattice ] , with interaction of infinite range , i.e. , every spin interacts with all the other spins in the system , with interaction strength independent of the distance between the spins . within each sublattice ,",
    "the interaction is ferromagnetic , and between the sublattices the interaction is antiferromagnetic ; as a result there is no frustration . the hamiltonian is written as , @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) can be solved in the following manner@xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 then the hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath3 since @xmath4=[\\s_a , h]=[\\s_b , h]=0 $ ] , eigenstates of @xmath5 can be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with angular momentum eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , such that the energy eigenvalue is , @xmath12 to minimize the energy , we must first maximize @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and then minimize @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the number of corresponding sublattice sites .",
    "physically this means that spins in the same sublattice are all parallel to each other , while spins in opposite sublattices are antiparallel .",
    "thus the ground state is , @xmath16     +    in this paper we only consider the simplest case with @xmath17 , thus the total system size is @xmath18 .",
    "then the ground state is reduced to an antiferromagnetic ground state which has zero total spin , |s_as_b;sm=|;00 .",
    "[ singletneel ] this ground state has perfect neel order , as manifested by the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath19",
    "we divide the system spatially into two subsystems which are labeled 1 and 2 respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.division ] , and study the ground state entanglement entropy @xmath20 between these two subsystems .",
    "@xmath20 is defined to be the von neumann entropy of either of the subsystems , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , which can be calculated from the reduced density matrix , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem 1 , obtained from the density matrix @xmath25 of the whole system by tracing out degrees of freedom of the other subsystem , @xmath26 , and vice versa .    to solve for the explicit form of the reduced density matrix , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we further decompose the system into four parts , @xmath27 , with    ",
    "_ ia i 1  _ i ,  ",
    "_ a_2 = _ i a i 2  _ i ; +  _ b_1 = _ ib i 1  _ i ,  ",
    "_ b_2 = _ ib i 2  _ i .    therefore , these operators satisfy the following relations , @xmath28 here we note that , as discussed in the previous section , the spin state within each sublattice is ferromagnetic .",
    "this means that not only must the total spin quantum numbers of @xmath29 and @xmath30 take their maximum values , but the total spin quantum numbers of @xmath31 and @xmath32 must also take their maximum values .",
    "more importantly , these values are thus fixed , which enables us to treat the operators @xmath33 and @xmath32 as four single spins , and in what follows we shall denote these operators by their corresponding spin quantum numbers .",
    "the problem is then that we are given a four spin state in which the spins @xmath34 and @xmath35 are combined into a state with total spin @xmath10 and the spins @xmath36 and @xmath37 are combined in a state with total spin @xmath11 , and then these two states are combined into a total singlet ( resulting in the ground state of our long - range afm model ) , and we must express this state in a basis in which the spins @xmath34 and @xmath36 are combined into a state with total spin @xmath38 and @xmath35 and @xmath37 are combined into a state with total spin @xmath39 .",
    "this change of basis involves the familiar ls - jj coupling scheme .",
    "we proceed by first rewriting the density matrix describing the ground state in terms of the basis states @xmath40 by appropriate insertions of the unit operator @xmath41 [ eqn : rdm ]    & = |s_as_b;sms_as_b;sm| = | ; 00 ; 00| + & = _",

    "we then insert another unit operator @xmath43 to express this matrix element as the product of a clebsch - gordan coefficient and an ls - jj coupling coefficient@xcite , @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the ls - jj coupling coefficient or x - coefficient defined as ,    l_1 & s_1 & j_1 + l_2 & s_2 & j_2 + l & s & j +    = l_1 l_2 s_1 s_2 l s j m | l_1 s_1 l_2 s_2 j_1 j_2 j m.    since @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 .",
    "so @xmath48 , and for simplicity , we can now suppress the @xmath39 and @xmath49 indices and represent @xmath50 by @xmath51 without causing any ambiguity .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 in the following calculation , for consistency , we adopt the convention of wigner 6-j and 9-j symbols , the definitions of which , and the relation to the racah coefficients and ls - jj coupling coefficients ( or x - coefficients ) , are given in appendix a.    following wigner s convention , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lsjj ] ) can be written as , @xmath53    in our case @xmath54 , so the 9-j symbol can be expressed more simply in terms of a 6-j symbol@xcite ( see also appendix b ) , @xmath55    in our particular case , within each sublattice , the state is ferromagnetic , @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the size ( number of lattice sites ) of subsystem 1 . without losing any generality",
    ", we can let @xmath58 .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ eqn : szero ] ) we then have , @xmath59 using a symmetry property of the racah coefficients@xcite @xmath60 , we have , @xmath61 then we employ the following relation@xcite : @xmath62 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] this gives @xmath63^\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    now with the expression above , we can directly trace out the degrees of freedom in subsystem 2 from eq .",

    "is then given by @xmath64    here we note that , although @xmath51 is written with an explicit @xmath65 dependence , the actual expression is independent of @xmath65 . as a result , we can eliminate the summation over @xmath65 from ( [ eqn : entropy1 ] ) by multiplying by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "the final expression for the entanglement entropy is then @xmath67    in the following section we will first derive the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy @xmath20 in certain limits using the exact results above , and then present the results of our numerical calculation of @xmath20 with finite system sizes .",
    "in this section we consider two limiting cases :    ( i)@xmath68 , this case gives the saturated entropy at fixed @xmath69 since intuitively @xmath20 should increase with the subsystem size .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath70 , in this limit we are considering system s entanglement with its ( much larger ) environment , and generically we should be able to find that the entropy should be independent of the total system size as @xmath71 , which is indeed what we find .    to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy , we first consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath51 , then in the large @xmath69 limit . then the summation over @xmath38 which runs from 0 to @xmath72 can be replaced by an integral .",
    "as we will see , the distribution of @xmath51 is proportional to a gaussian function with respect to @xmath38 , thus the bounds of integration can be extended to from 0 to @xmath73 .    our concern is the distribution of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath38 , therefore , we extract the dependence on @xmath38 and then use the normalization condition @xmath74 to obtain the normalization constant . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lambda ] ) we can write ,    _ s_1m_1 ^ 2 & ~ + & + & ~e^- - .",
    "+    this approximation is generally good as long as both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are large . in our work ,",
    "@xmath77 , and @xmath75 is assumed to be @xmath78 ( equal partition ) or @xmath79 , so this criteria is satisfied quite well in both cases . then by the normalization condition    &",

    "s_1m_1 ^ 2 e^- - .",
    "the entanglement entropy is therefore given by @xmath81      here for simplicity we set @xmath69 even ( note that the total system size is @xmath18 ) , thus @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , then @xmath84 and the entanglement entropy becomes , @xmath85 compared with our numerical result , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig.ep ] , we see that they agree very well , not only for the prefactor of the @xmath86 dependence , but the intersection coefficient as well .      in this case , @xmath70 , we can expand the entropy as follows ,    e & + & = n_1 + ( 1 - + ) + & n_1 - + o(()^2 ) .",
    "from this expression we see that when the assumed condition is satisfied the entropy indeed depends only on the subsystem size to leading order .",
    "to check to what extent our approximation is still valid , we plot the expression as a function of total system size @xmath69 with different subsystem size @xmath75 , as shown in fig . [ fig.uep.n ] .",
    "this figure shows that when @xmath69 is large enough the entropy becomes independent of @xmath69 , and the first order term , @xmath87 dominates except for an apparently constant shift from the exact curve .",
    "we have also plotted the asymptotic behavior as a function of @xmath75 while keeping @xmath69 fixed , shown in fig.[fig.uep.l ] .",

    "we first obtain reduced density matrices for subsystems 1 and 2 by tracing out degrees of freedom in 2 and 1 from @xmath94 :    & _ 1=tr_(2)= _ m = -s^s",

    "the entanglement entropy is defined as@xcite e = ( e_1 + e_2 - e_0 ) / 2 .    for the present case @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "can be easily obtained from the following observations .",
    "( i ) because the total spin is fully magnetized , so are those in the subsystems : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "n_1e ( n_1 ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin models with perfect long - range magnetic order in their ground states , and calculated the ground state block entanglement entropy when the system is divided into two subsystems ( or blocks ) . in both cases",
    "we find the entropy grows logarithmically with block size . in the following",
    "we discuss the significance of our results .",
    "first of all , there _ is _ entanglement , despite the perfect long - range order in the ground state .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as one might think that in such hamiltonians one can obtain certain properties of the system exactly using mean - field theory , in which the ground state is approximated by a product state with no entanglement .",
    "our results indicate that mean - field approximation is _ not _ appropriate for entanglement calculation , even if it is  exact \" for other purposes .",
    "this point is particularly striking for the afm model , in which the ground state is unique .",
    "the source of the discrepancy is there still is quantum fluctuations even in such a model with super long - range interaction , which render the ground state a singlet , even though quantum fluctuation does not reduce the size of the order parameter .",
    "the entanglement is due to the quantum fluctuation of the _ direction _ of the order parameter , which is a collective mode with zero wave - vector ( or a zero mode ) ; this is missed by any mean - field approximation .",
    "secondly , the entropy does _ not _ obey the area law .",
    "the reasons for that are different for the two cases we studied . in the afm model ,",
    "the interaction does not depend on distance in the hamiltonian , thus there is no notion of distance or area in this model . in the fm model , on the other hand , the ground state is _ independent _ of the hamiltonian , as long as all interactions are fm .",
    "the fully magnetized ground states are invariant under permutation of spins , thus there is no notion of distance or area in the _ ground states _ , even though the terms in hamiltonian can have distance dependence .",
    "thirdly , the absence of an area law is special to the cases we studied , again each in their own ways . for the fm model ,",
    "it is specific to zero temperature .",
    "as soon as a finite temperature is turned on , one expects the entanglement entropy ( or mutual information ) to grow with the area separating the two subsystems or blocks , as long as the interaction is not long - ranged@xcite .",
    "for the afm model at zero temperature , we do expect an area - law contribution to the entropy for short - range or even certain power - law long - ranged interaction due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is most easily seen within spin - wave approximation , which is a version of mean - field theory . within the spin wave approximation spins",
    "are mapped onto bosons , and the hamiltonian is mapped onto coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "detailed recent studies have established the area law of entanglement for such systems@xcite . in this regard",
    "the super long - range afm model we study here is very special , in that all spin - wave degrees of freedom at finite wave - vector disappear , and the only degrees of freedom contributing to the ground state are zero wave - vector modes represented by @xmath102 and @xmath103@xcite ; as a result there is no area - law contribution from quantum fluctuations of spin - waves .",
    "we conclude by speculating that in the more general cases that do have an area - law contribution to the entanglement entropy , as long as long - range spin order is present , the logarithmic contribution due to fluctuations of the order parameter zero - modes we find here will remain and show up as a sub - leading ( yet singular ) correction to the area law",
    ". if that is the case , then conventional long - range order contributes to the entanglement entropy in a way similar to the much subtler topological order@xcite or quantum criticality@xcite .",
    "6-j symbol & racah coefficient : @xmath104^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\ & \\times \\bra j_1,j_{23};j|j_{12},j_3;j\\ket.\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 refer to the coupling of @xmath107 and @xmath108 or @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "in this appendix we give a slightly simplified derivation of the entanglement entropy for the singlet ground state of the infinite - range afm model defined in sec .",
    "ii . while this derivation is not as general as that given in the main text ( which can , in principle , be applied to states with nonzero total spin )",
    ", it has the advantage of clarifying the reason for the appearance of the wigner 6j - symbol in the final result for the entanglement entropy .    following the notation of sec .",
    "ii and iii , we consider the case of @xmath18 spin-1/2 particles divided equally into two sublattices @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the spins on each sublattice are taken to be fully polarized , so that @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in what follows",
    "we will use a notation in which , for example , the state for which the spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 form a singlet is represented as @xmath115 . in this notation ,",
    "pairs of spins contained within a set of parenthesis form a state whose total spin is equal to the subscript labeling the parenthesis .",
    "thus , @xmath116 is a singlet state equivalent to the state defined in eq .",
    "( [ singletneel ] ) in sec .",
    "( needless to say , for this state to exist it is necessary to have @xmath117 . )",
    "now we consider what happens if these spins are divided into two different subsystems labeled @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "following sec .",
    "ii , if @xmath120 is the total spin quantum number of the @xmath111 sublattice spins in subsystem @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the total spin quantum number of the @xmath112 sublattice spins in subsystem @xmath121 , then the state of the spins on the @xmath111 sublattice can be written @xmath123 and the state of the spins on the @xmath112 sublattice can be written @xmath124 .",
    "the total singlet state for the entire system , @xmath125 , can then be expressed as @xmath126    note that we have not included the @xmath127 quantum numbers associated with the @xmath128-components of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in writing the above expression for @xmath125 .",
    "this is not necessary because the requirement that the total spin of the two sublattices combine to form a singlet uniquely determines the state .",
    "it should , of course , always be understood that when we write eq .",
    "( [ singlet ] ) what is really meant ( in obvious notation ) is , @xmath129    equation ( [ trivial ] ) effectively ( up to irrelevant phase factors ) gives the schmidt decomposition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) of the state @xmath125 into the two subsystems consisting of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 sublattices .",
    "given such a schmidt decomposition it is straightforward to determine the entanglement between these two subsystems .",
    "however , here we are interested not in the trivial entanglement between subsystems @xmath111 and @xmath112 , but the entanglement between subsystems 1 and 2 . to find this we need the schmidt decomposition of @xmath125 into subsystems 1 and 2 .    note",
    "that because @xmath125 is a total spin singlet it follows that @xmath130 where , for convenience , we have rearranged the order of the spins in the second equality .",
    "the key point here is that the three spins @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 must be in a state which is a total spin eigenstate with total spin @xmath36 . if this were not the case it would be impossible to form a total spin singlet with the remaining spin @xmath36 .",
    "next we use the wigner @xmath131-symbol to express the three spin state @xmath132 as a superposition of states of the form @xmath133 . the result is @xmath134 where the coefficients are given by @xmath135 ( see appendix a ) .    rearranging the spins again , and using the fact that the total spin of all four spins is 0 ,",
    "we can express the resulting four spin basis states as follows , @xmath136 where , obviously , @xmath137 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath138 finally , after writing the @xmath127 sum explicitly ( as in eq .",
    "( [ trivial ] ) ) , we have the desired schmidt decomposition ( again , up to irrelevant phases ) of the state @xmath125 into subsystems 1 and 2 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 when the values of @xmath113 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 are substituted into this expression it can be seen to be equivalent to that given in eq .",
