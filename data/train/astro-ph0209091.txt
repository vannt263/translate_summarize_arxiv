    "blazars including high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) are the most extreme and powerful sources among active galactic nuclei .",
    "the standard blazar model consists of a supermassive black hole ejecting twin relativistic jets , one of which is close to the line of sight .",
    "several hbls such as mrk 501 , mrk 421 , pks 2155 - 304 , 1es 2344@xmath2514 , h1426@xmath2428 and 1es1959@xmath2650 are of particular interest because they emit tev photons ( see catanese & weekes 1999 ; horns et al .",
    "the detection and study of such photons can provide new insights on the energetics and physical conditions in the emission regions of such blazars ( katarzyski , sol & kus 2001 ; kino , takahara & kusunose 2002 ) .",
    "also , constraints on the spectral energy distribution of the intergalactic infrared background can be inferred from the observations on tev photons ( for a review see hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "stecker , de jager & salamon ( 1992 ) have emphasized that the high - energy gamma photon spectra from these blazars will be modified by strongly redshift - dependent absorption effects due to interactions of such photons with the intergalactic infrared - uv background , and indicated that the intrinsic spectrum of an observed tev blazar can be derived by evaluating the optical depth to tev photons .",
    "such calculations were made for mrk 501 during the 1997 flaring activity , leading to an inferred intrinsic high - energy spectrum with a broad , flat peak that is much higher than the observed one in the @xmath3 tev range ( konopelko et al .",
    "1999 ; de jager & stecker 2002 , hereafter ds ) .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is that a significant fraction of the original high - energy gamma rays have been absorbed in @xmath4 interactions with photons of the intergalactic infrared - uv background , leading to electron / positron pairs .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to suggest that inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the resulting electron / positron pairs against cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons may produce a new gev emission component in tev blazars . for gamma - ray bursts",
    ", such compton scattering leads to an observable , delayed mev - gev emission component if the intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) are very weak ( plaga 1995 ; cheng & cheng 1996 ; dai & lu 2002 ) . a similar phenomenon is also expected from gamma - ray burst proton interactions with the cmb ( waxman & coppi 1996 ) . here",
    "we discuss the well - studied blazar mrk 501 , both because the high - energy spectrum up to 20 tev of strong flares of this blazar in 1997 has been observed by the hegra air cerenkov telescope system ( aharonian et al . 1999 , 2001 ) , and because the intrinsic spectrum of mrk 501 over two decades of energy has been derived based on the consistency between the whipple telescope and hegra spectra ( ds ) .",
    "the strength of igmfs has not been determined so far .",
    "faraday rotation measures imply an upper limit of @xmath5 g for a field with 1 mpc correlation length ( kronberg 1994 for a review ) .",
    "other methods were proposed to probe fields in the range @xmath6 g to @xmath7 g ( lee , olinto & sigl 1995 ; plaga 1995 ) . to interpret the observed @xmath8",
    "g magnetic fields in galaxies and x - ray clusters , the seed fields required in dynamo theories could be as low as @xmath7 g ( kulsrud et al .",
    "1997 ; kulsrud 1999 ) .",
    "furlanetto & loeb ( 2001 ) argued that quasar outflows may pollute the intergalactic medium , but the possible weak igmfs in voids may remain uncontaminated .",
    "theoretical calculations of primordial magnetic fields show that these fields could be of order @xmath7 g or even as low as @xmath9 g , generated during the cosmological qcd or electroweak phase transition respectively ( sigl , olinto & jedamzik 1997 ) . in this letter",
    "we propose that by observing a hitherto undiscovered gev emission component from flares of tev blazars such as mrk 501 , one may be able to obtain important information or constraints on the poorly known igmfs .",
    "we consider a strong flare , e.g. in mrk 501 , of duration @xmath10 .",
    "a fraction of the high - energy @xmath0-rays emitted during such a flare can be absorbed in the cosmic background radiation fields as these @xmath0-rays travel towards the observer .",
    "the pair production optical depth @xmath11 depends strongly on the @xmath0-ray energy ( @xmath12 ) and the redshift ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "ds numerically calculated @xmath11 as a function of the photon energy for low redshifts by using the models of malkan & stecker ( 2001 ) of the infrared background radiation , and extrapolating these models into the optical - uv range in terms of recent galaxy count data .",
    "ds considered both  fast evolution \" and  baseline \" cases , which may be considered to bracket the spectral energy distribution of the intergalactic infrared - uv background radiation .",
    "if primary photons of energy @xmath12 are absorbed , the resulting electron / positron pairs have lorentz factors @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the electron mass .",
    "the pairs will subsequently compton scatter on the ambient cmb photons . as a result",
    ", the initial energy of a microwave photon , @xmath16 , is boosted by ic scattering up to an average value @xmath17 gev , where @xmath18 is the mean energy of the cmb photons with @xmath19k and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "several timescales are involved in the emission process .",
    "the first is the well - known angular spreading time , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 cm is the typical pair - production distance , @xmath23 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath24 is the intergalactic infrared photon number density ( see dai & lu 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , primary tev photons have a typical mean free path of a few mpc , so that although the source may be in a region of a high field with @xmath5 g , these photons may escape to much lower field regions .",
    "six tev blazars detected so far have redshifts of @xmath25 to @xmath26 , implying that their luminosity distances are much larger than @xmath27 . only in such cases",
    "are our calculations valid .",
    "the ic cooling timescale ( in the local rest frame ) of relativistic electrons with lorentz factor of @xmath28 is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cmb energy density .",
    "thus the typical flight path , in which most of the electron energy is lost , is @xmath31 cm .",
    "this is much less than the distance from the source to the observer , implying that energy loss of the electron due to ic scattering is local . in the absence of any igmf",
    ", the ic cooling timescale in the observer frame would be @xmath32 .    in the presence of igmfs with strength @xmath33",
    ", the electrons will be deflected .",
    "the deflection angle is estimated by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the larmor radius of the electrons .",
    "the contribution to the emission time due to magnetic deflection becomes @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this may provide a probe of weak igmfs and its application to the delayed high - energy emission of grb 940217 yields igmfs which are as weak as @xmath38 g .",
    "therefore , the duration estimate of the ic emission from electron / positron pairs scattering off the cmb is @xmath39 . taking @xmath40 , which implies a scattered photon energy @xmath41",
    ", we find that the duration of the expected gev emission is always given by the variability timescale of the tev gamma - ray flux for photon energes larger than @xmath42 , and it is given by @xmath43 for photon energies smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "the optical depth ( @xmath11 ) to high - energy photons was used by ds to derive the intrinsic @xmath0-ray spectrum of mrk 501 during its 1997 high state , which can be parameterized as @xmath44^{(\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2)/f},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 tev , and the parameters @xmath46 ( in tev ) , @xmath47 ( in @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are shown in table 3 of ds .",
    "please note that equation ( 1 ) is a time - averaged spectrum of a long - term outburst of about 6 months in 1997 . during this period mrk 501",
    "has shown a number of one - day flares , whose gamma - ray flux values appear to be larger than the time - averaged ones by a factor of @xmath52 with @xmath53 . thus , for accurate calculations of the gev emission one should use the specific flux values for the flare considered . here",
    "we take @xmath54 as a conservative value . letting the luminosity distance to the source",
    "be @xmath55 cm , we have the total electron energy spectrum ( including the positrons ) , @xmath56^{(\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2)/f } \\left(1-e^{-\\tau_{\\gamma\\gamma}^{\\rm ex}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the observed time - averaged scattered - photon spectrum is given by ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the externally scattered photon energy , @xmath61 is the time measured in the local rest frame , and @xmath62 , expressed by equation ( 2.48 ) of blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) using the klein - nishina ( kn ) cross - section formula , is the spectrum of photons scattered by an electron with lorentz factor of @xmath28 from a segment of the cmb photon gas of differential number density @xmath63 .",
    "if the electron energy spectrum is simplified as @xmath64 , then a primary analysis similar to dai & lu ( 2002 ) shows that in the thomson limit the scattered photon spectrum @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , implying a spectral turnover at scattered photon energies of @xmath69 .",
    "figure 1 shows the energy spectra of scattered photons for different assumed igmfs during the 1997 flaring activity of mrk 501 . for an igmf @xmath70 g",
    ", we indeed see a spectral turnover , whose energy is strongly dependent on the field strength .",
    "figure 2 presents the emission spectra for different flare durations , and we find that for a fixed igmf , the longer the duration , the smaller the turnover energy becomes and thus the emission becomes easier to detect .",
    "the observed low - energy hump of mrk 501 is usually thought to be due to synchrotron radiation from a relativistic plasma blob . the comoving spectral synchrotron photon energy density is given by @xmath71 /(r_b^2c\\delta^4)$ ] , where @xmath72 is the observed synchrotron flux at energy of @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the comoving radius , @xmath75 is the doppler factor , and primes denote comoving quantities . here",
    "@xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "in order to calculate the comoving spectral synchrotron photon number density @xmath78 , we approximate the flux density @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 observed during the flares of 1997 . from the observations by catanese",
    "( 1997 ) , pian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and petry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , it can be seen that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 kev and @xmath86 kev , and the synchrotron radiation flux @xmath87 reaches a maximum value @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "we first derive a generic formula for the optical depth to a photon with @xmath90tev inside the blob . in the comoving frame of the blob , this photon can annihilate a second softer photon with energy greater than @xmath91 , yielding an electron / positron pair .",
    "the comoving total number density of soft photons that have energies greater than @xmath92 is calculated by @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the optical depth is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the averaged cross section assuming an @xmath97 spectrum ( svensson 1987 ; also see lithwick & sari 2001 and zhang & mszros 2001 )",
    ". inserting equation ( 4 ) into the above equation yields @xmath98 where @xmath99 for @xmath100 , equation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath101 , which is consistent with the previously used optical depth ( see aharonian et al . 1999 ; ds ) . inserting the observed values of the parameters into equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 )",
    ", we have @xmath102 .",
    "the observed highest energy @xmath103 tev implies that the optical depth to a photon with such an energy is less than unity .",
    "this provides a lower limit to the doppler factor @xmath104 , i.e. , the photon - energy cutoff due to pair production in the blob can be larger than 20 tev for @xmath105 .",
    "we next discuss the ssc spectrum from the blob .",
    "we assume the accelerated electrons in the blob to have a power - law energy distribution with an index of @xmath106 and the maximum lorentz factor of @xmath107 .",
    "we also assume that the magnetic field strength in the blob is @xmath108 .",
    "since the synchrotron peak of the @xmath72 flux corresponds to the emission from electrons with the maximum lorentz factor , we obtain @xmath109 . because of @xmath110 , relativistic kn corrections to the compton spectrum are very important .",
    "we estimate the lower limit to the observed gamma energy at which the kn effects should be considered , @xmath111 gev .",
    "in addition , the compton peak energy in the kn range is approximated by @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the ssc photon spectrum @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 . comparing this spectrum with equation ( 1 ) , we find @xmath117 , which is not only consistent with the value of @xmath106 shown by kino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) but is also in agreement with the index of @xmath118 obtained from the bepposax observations by pian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "figure 1 also presents the ssc spectra , whose high - energy segments are assumed to be the intrinsic spectra derived by ds . it can be seen from this figure that the flux of the externally scattered photons is higher than that of the ssc photons in the blob for an igmf @xmath1 g. furthermore , the externally scattered photon flux is consistent with the existing observations by egret and large enough to be detected by _ glast_.",
    "using the intrinsic @xmath0-ray spectrum of mrk 501 during its 1997 flaring activity derived by ds as an example , we have predicted a new gev emission component for this and similar hbls , if their radiation reaches us through regions with a low magnetic field as expected in under - dense voids .",
    "this gev emission is due to the ic scattering of cmb photons by the electron / positron pairs produced in interactions of high - energy photons with the cosmic infrared - uv background photons .",
    "we summarize our findings : first , the gev flux of the scattered cmb photons is higher than that from the ssc process in the blob for igmfs @xmath119 g . for an igmf @xmath70 g , there is an observable spectral turnover , whose position is strongly dependent on the field strength .",
    "this spectral turnover is due to the fact that the lower energy emission would have a longer delay .",
    "second , the typical duration of the gev emission is always given by the variability timescale of the tev gamma - ray flux for photon energes larger than @xmath42 , and it is given by @xmath120 for photon energies smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "third , the gev emission predicted here is consistent with existing egret observations , and is strong enough to be detected by _ glast _",
    ", for igmfs @xmath1 g and flare times @xmath121 day .",
    "fourth , we have derived a generic formula for the optical depth due to pair production in a relativistic blob , @xmath122 , where @xmath75 is the doppler factor and @xmath123 is the index of the softer photon energy spectrum .",
    "this optical depth is not only consistent with the previously used formula in the @xmath124 case but can also be generalized to broader cases .",
    "we note that even if a source such as mrk 501 is not in a void , primary tev photons emitted from the source have such a long mean free path that electron / positron pairs may be produced in void regions .",
    "thus , detections on the gev emission would provide a sensitive probe for weak igmfs , of consequence for cosmogonical and galactic dynamo theories .",
    "our results are also relevant for the quiescent state of hbls such as mrk 501 .",
    "aharonian , coppi , & vlk ( 1994 ) and coppi & aharonian ( 1997 ) discussed a similar model for very high energy emission ( @xmath125 gev ) from blazars in the quiescent state .",
    "we here use the recent models for the intergalactic infrared - uv background radiation to discuss lower energy emission from tev blazars . according to catanese et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the whipple telescope detected a flux of @xmath126 in the quiescent state of this hbl .",
    "the external pair - production optical depth @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and thus the flux of the externally scattered photons with an energy of @xmath129 gev is estimated as @xmath130\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,{\\rm ergs}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ ] and @xmath131 for the  baseline \" and  fast - evolution \" models of ds , respectively .",
    "these values of the gev emission flux are much larger than @xmath132 , the sensitivity of _ glast _ at energy @xmath133 gev for steady sources in a one - year survey .",
    "therefore , even in the quiescent state of mrk 501 , its externally scattered emission may also be detected by _",
    "glast_. it should be pointed out that such detections are possible for a magnetic deflection angle that is less than the blazar jet opening angle .",
    "this also requires that the field strength be below @xmath134 g , similar to the flare case , for an opening angle @xmath26 . above this value of the magnetic field",
