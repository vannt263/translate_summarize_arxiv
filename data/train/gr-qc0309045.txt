    "the final stage of coalescing binary neutron stars is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for ground - based laser interferometers such as geo600 , ligo , tama300 , and virgo @xcite .",
    "it is also considered as one of the candidates for short - duration gamma - ray burst sources @xcite . with accurate templates of gravitational waves from coalescing binary neutron stars",
    ", it may be possible to extract informations from signals observed by the above interferometers @xcite , through the matched filtering technique @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to theoretically predict the wave form of gravitational radiation as well as to understand the details of the physics of binary neutron stars .",
    "with such a motivation , many efforts have been invested in this topic ( some recent reviews can be found in @xcite ) when summarizing these researches , it is convenient to separate the evolution of binary neutron stars into three phases .",
    "the first one is the _ pointlike inspiral _ in which the separation between the two stars is much larger than the radius of one star , and the binary system evolves adiabatically . in this stage ,",
    "the post - newtonian expansion works excellently , and accurate gravitational wave forms have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the second phase is the _ intermediate _ one or _",
    "hydrodynamical inspiral _ in which the separation between the two components is as small as a few times of the radius of one star .",
    "this phase is also inspiraling , the time scale of the orbital shrink being still larger than the orbital period , hence the qualifier of _ quasiequilibrium _ given to it .",
    "what differs this phase from the pointlike inspiral is that the tidal deformation of the stars is no longer negligible , making necessary a hydrodynamical treatment , in addition to general relativity .",
    "the final phase is the _ merger _ , in which the two stars coalesces dynamically .",
    "the first successful merger computations have been obtained by shibata et al .",
    "four years ago @xcite , and various groups are currently working on this subject @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we focus on the intermediate phase ( hydrodynamical inspiral ) .",
    "this phase is interesting because one might get informations on the equation of state of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the most realistic initial data for computing the merger are given at the end point of sequences in the hydrodynamical inspiral @xcite .",
    "various approaches to compute binary neutron star models in the hydrodynamical inspiral phase have been considered : _ ( i ) _",
    "( semi-)analytical @xcite and _ ( ii ) _ numerical @xcite in newtonian gravity , _ ( iii ) _",
    "( semi-)analytical @xcite and _ ( iv ) _ numerical @xcite in the post - newtonian approximation , and _ ( v ) _ numerical in the framework of general relativity @xcite . binary neutron stars gradually decrease their orbital separations as a result of the emission of gravitational radiation . however , it is still impossible to integrate the einstein s equations for the thousands of orbits of the hydrodynamical inspiral .",
    "fortunately the time scale of the orbit shrink being much longer than the orbital period , the hydrodynamical inspiral phase can be approximated by a sequence of steady - state ( quasiequilibrium ) configurations . in order to combine general relativity and quasiequilibrium",
    ", we adopt the conformal - flatness condition for the spatial part of the metric  the so - called isenberg - wilson - mathews ( iwm ) approximation of general relativity @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "this treatment postpones one of the goals of the study of the hydrodynamical inspiral , i.e. the theoretical prediction of the wave form of gravitational radiation .",
    "accordingly , we focus on the evolution of various physical parameters during the hydrodynamical inspiral and investigate the nature of the innermost orbit ( mass - shedding or orbital instability ) .    to get a quasiequilibrium configuration of binary neutron stars , we have to specify the rotation state of the system .",
    "about ten years ago , kochaneck @xcite and bildsten and cutler @xcite concluded that the irrotational flow is much more realistic than the synchronized rotation , because the shear viscosity of nuclear matter is far too low to synchronize the spins of the stars with the orbital motion by the dynamical merging . the formulation for solving quasiequilibrium configurations of irrotational binary neutron stars in general relativity has been proposed by several authors @xcite . in the present work , we have calculated not only irrotational configurations but also synchronized ones in order to exhibit the differences between these two extreme states . beside the type of rotation , some equation of state for neutron star matter must be specified to get a binary model .",
    "although some realistic equation of state arising from nuclear physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) has to be used , we adopt here the polytropic one for simplicity .",
    "nevertheless we vary the adiabatic index in the range @xmath3 to @xmath4 to cover the large range of nuclear equations of state published in the literature .",
    "quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars based on a selection of realistic equations of state will be presented in a future work .    under the above assumptions , we have computed quasiequilibrium sequences of binary systems composed of neutron stars with different masses . in the three known binary neutron star systems ( observed as binary pulsars with a large mass companion ) , the two components have almost the same mass : the relative difference between the masses of the two stars are 4 % for psr b1913 + 16 @xcite , less than 0.1 % for psr b1534 + 12 @xcite , and about 1 % for psr b2127 + 11c @xcite . until now",
    ", all studies on quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars in the framework of general relativity have dealt with only identical - mass binary systems , except for our previous work @xcite ( hereafter paper iii ) . in that article",
    "we have also presented quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "however , we limited ourselves to the adiabatic index @xmath5 , because it was the first step to relativistic different - mass binary systems . in the present article",
    ", we enlarge the range of adiabatic index , investigating softer equations of state ( @xmath3 ) and stiffer ones ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : section  [ s : method ] provides a brief summary of the assumptions , basic equations , and numerical methods which we adopt .",
    "some code tests not shown in previous articles of this series are given in sec .",
    "[ s : tests ] , and the numerical results are presented in sec .  [ s : results ] .",
    "section  [ s : discussion ] is devoted to the discussions and we conclude the paper with a summary in sec .  [ s : summary ] . through the paper ,",
    "we use units in which @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the speed of light and @xmath10 the gravitational constant .",
    "the details about our method and basic equations have been already given in previous papers of this series ( refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , hereafter paper i and ii respectively ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to those articles and simply summarize here the basic assumptions , the basic equations and our numerical method .",
    "firstly , we assume the binary system to be in a _",
    "quasiequilibrium _ state .",
    "this assumption comes from the fact that the time scale @xmath11 of the orbital shrink driven by the emission of gravitational radiation is longer than the orbital period @xmath12 .",
    "indeed the following relation holds : 1.1 ( d 6m_tot ) ^5/2 ( m_tot 4 ) , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote respectively the separation between two stars , the total mass , and the reduced mass . hence for an equal - mass system , @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "it is well known that apart from shrinking the orbits , the reaction to gravitational radiation circularizes them .",
    "this implies a continuous spacetime symmetry , called _ helical symmetry _",
    "@xcite and represented by the killing vector : = t + , where @xmath18 is the orbital angular velocity and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the natural frame vectors associated with the time coordinate @xmath21 and the azimuthal coordinate @xmath22 of an asymptotic inertial observer .",
    "the second assumption is applied to the stress - energy tensor , which we require to have the _ perfect fluid _ form : t _ = ( e+p ) u _ u _ + p g _ , where @xmath23 denotes the fluid proper energy density , @xmath24 the fluid pressure , @xmath25 the fluid 4-velocity , and @xmath26 the spacetime metric .",
    "this constitutes a very good approximation for neutron star matter .",
    "the third assumption concerns the fluid motion inside each star .",
    "we consider both cases of _ synchronized _ ( also called _ corotating _ ) motion and _ irrotational _ flow . note",
    "that while only the latter state can be regarded as realistic @xcite , we consider both states in order to exhibit the difference between them and thus investigate the hydrodynamical effects on the main properties of the binary system .",
    "the fourth assumption regards the ( zero - temperature ) equation of state .",
    "we choose a _ polytropic _ one : p = n^ , where @xmath27 is the fluid baryon number density , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are some constants . in the present article , we consider that the two stars in the binary system have the same @xmath28 and @xmath29 , even if they have different masses .",
    "finally , we assume that the spatial part of the metric is conformally flat , which corresponds to the _ isenberg - wilson - mathews ( iwm ) _ approximation of general relativity @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the spacetime metric takes the form : ds^2 = -(n^2 -b_i b^i ) dt^2 -2b_i dt dx^i + a^2 f_ij dx^i dx^j , [ eq : metric ] @xmath30 being the lapse function , @xmath31 the shift vector of co - orbiting coordinates , @xmath32 the conformal factor , and @xmath33 the flat spatial metric .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation should be checked ( see sec .",
    "iii.a of paper  i ) .",
    "the comparison between the iwm results presented here and the non - conformally flat ones will be performed elsewhere @xcite .      under the assumptions listed above , we have derived the equations to be integrated in paper i. here we present only some outline of them .",
    "the gravitational field equations have been obtained within the 3 + 1 decomposition of the einstein s equation @xcite .",
    "the constraint equations are treated in the so - called conformal thin - sandwich approach ( see @xcite for a review ) , which enables to take into account the helical symmetry of spacetime .",
    "the trace of the spatial part of the einstein equation combined with the hamiltonian constraint results in two equations : & = & 4a^2 ( e+s ) + a^2 k_ij k^ij - _ i ^i , + & = & 4a^2 s + 3 4 a^2 k_ij k^ij -1 2 ( _ i ^i + _",

    "apart from the gravitational field equations , we have to solve the fluid equations .",
    "the equations governing the quasiequilibrium state are the euler equation and the equation of baryon number conservation",

    ", we have developed a numerical code which is based on a multidomain spectral method with surface - fitted coordinates @xcite .",
    "this code is built upon the c++ library lorene @xcite .",
    "one of the merits of considering multiple domains is to allow for boundary conditions at infinity , by compactifying the outermost domain .",
