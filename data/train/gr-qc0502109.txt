    "causality plays an important role in the brane - world scenario .",
    "null geodesics passing through the extra dimension may connect points in the lower dimension which are causally disconnected in terms of the null geodesics confined to the brane @xcite .",
    "thus instead of inflation , such null geodesics could be used to solve the cosmological horizon problem .",
    "the condition for the existence of such  causality violating \" null geodesics , which pass through the @xmath1 bulk , is merely the deviation from a pure tension - like stress energy tensor , i.e. provided that the energy density @xmath2 and the isotropic pressure @xmath3 of the brane satisfies @xcite @xmath4 then the extrinsic curvature bends the brane concave towards the bulk , allowing the existence of such null geodesics .",
    "initially most authors considered these `` shortcuts '' through the bulk for a static cosmological brane ( brane based approach ) .",
    "they made use of the most general metric ( see @xcite ) of the form @xmath5 null bulk geodesic equations of motion has been computed for static and cosmological single brane models ( see @xcite ) . it was found that although there are effective acausality in some cases , there is no _ a priori _ solution to the horizon problem .",
    "a more realistic scenario was found by considering a dynamical brane ( bulk based approach ) .",
    "it has been shown that the motion of a domain wall in the bulk can be interpreted as cosmological expansion or contraction on the wall ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a generalization of birkhoff s theorem can be used to show that a fixed wall embedded in a non - static spacetime is strictly equivalent to a moving wall embedded in a static spacetime and so establishing in full generality the equivalence between the two approaches ( see @xcite ) .",
    "solutions have also been found for higher dimensional dynamic domain walls that couples to bulk matter @xcite .",
    "causality can now be investigated in a different way .",
    "the trajectories of the null geodesics and the brane s equations of motion in the bulk are first obtained .",
    "these are then plotted on the same set of axes , with both curves having the same initial conditions .",
    "if the curves intersect again , then it can be said that two points are causally connected through the bulk .",
    "the brane s equations of motion for a frw brane in a @xmath1 bulk ( only considering the tension of the brane and not the matter inside ) was obtained in @xcite .",
    "shortcuts through the bulk could thus be investigated from the dynamical or bulk based approach ( see e.g.@xcite ) . a frw brane embedded in a @xmath1",
    "was used and it was found that although the distance covered by a graviton passing through the bulk is longer than the corresponding distance on the brane , it is not enough to solve the horizon problem @xcite .",
    "shortcuts have also been investigated in various other models , such as ; six dimensional brane worlds @xcite , @xmath6-branes ( domain walls ) @xcite and for nonlinear dynamical universes @xcite .    in non of the references above ( and",
    "no reference to our knowledge ) , has the condition of escape been determined for a graviton to actually leave the brane . so far most authors have assumed that gravitons escape freely into the bulk .",
    "if this was the case , why then do nt all the gravitons escape into the bulk ?",
    "this is the main question which we will try and answer in this paper .",
    "we will attempt to firstly determine whether null geodesics return to the brane after they have escaped and secondly the condition for a graviton to escape from the brane .",
    "we start with the 5-dimensional anti - de sitter schwarzschild metric @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the global bulk time , @xmath9 is the bulk dimension and @xmath10 is the metric for a maximally symmetric three - dimensional  spaces ( @xmath11 for a flat space , @xmath12 for a three sphere and @xmath13 for a hyperbolic three space ) .",
    "the function @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the anti - de -sitter radius of curvature , @xmath17 is the negative bulk cosmological constant ( i.e. @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the five dimensional schwarzschild - like mass .",
    "since the third term in the equation above scales like radiation , @xmath19 is sometimes called the dark radiation or weyl parameter .",
    "the solutions are anti - de sitter when @xmath20 and when @xmath21 we have a bulk black hole with a horizon at @xmath22    a spherical coordinate system @xmath23 can now be introduced in the brane which is centered at a point a , so that any path can be described by a radial geodesic @xcite .",
    "then due to the radial geodesics we may ignore the angular variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that we are left with a three dimensional problem with the resulting metric being given by @xmath26 the geodesics may be easily obtained by using the symmetries to obtain the killing vectors , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "then the vector tangent to the geodesics , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an affine parameter that relates each of the three parameters @xmath33 to one another .",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive constants which are similarly defined as the  energy at infinity \" @xmath34 and  angular momentum \" @xmath36 in standard general relativity ( see @xcite ) .    for a null geodesic",
    "we furthermore have @xmath37 equations ( [ pt ] ) , ( [ pr ] ) and ( [ dr / dlam ] ) may be rewritten in the standard gr form of @xcite by setting @xmath38 so that the full set of geodesic equations are @xmath39",
    "we start by introducing the proper time @xmath40 on the brane , which is defined by @xcite as @xmath41 so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the usual cosmological scale factor in the brane - world which can be obtained from the modified friedmann equation which is determined from the junction conditions .",
    "the israel junction conditions @xcite relate the discontinuity in the second fundamental form ( extrinsic curvature ) through the brane and the energy momentum tensor in the brane .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the jump in extrinsic curvature on the two sides of the brane , then the junction conditions for a @xmath47 symmetric brane is @xcite @xmath48 the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface can be computed using the unit norm vector ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume an isotropic distribution of matter on the brane , then the energy momentum tensor @xmath49 in the brane is given by @xmath50 where @xmath2 is the energy density and @xmath3 is the isotropic pressure of the brane",
    ".    from the junction conditions above one obtains two sets of equation governing the evolution of the brane ( see @xcite ) : @xmath51 and @xmath52    we require some equation of state that relates the matter density @xmath53 and pressure @xmath54 on the brane .",
    "we follow convention by setting @xmath55 where @xmath56 is tension of the wall .",
    "the equation of state then may be given by @xmath57 substitution then yields the conservation equations as @xmath58 with the solution @xmath59 where the subscript @xmath60 means any given time .",
    "similarly we may obtain the modified friedmann equation of @xcite in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the critical tension for fine tuning .",
    "the cosmological constant in the brane then has the form @xmath63",
    "in the case of a domain wall , there is no matter on the wall so we do not expect the escaping gravitons to be attracted back to the brane .",
    "a more realistic scenario would be to consider a brane with isotropically distributed matter .",
    "analytically computing trajectories of the moving brane with matter is difficult so we make use of potential diagrams to study whether gravitational signals will return to the brane . in classical gr ,",
    "potential diagrams have been found useful for qualitative analysis of orbits of particles and photons in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "potential diagrams has been used before to investigate lorentz violations in @xmath64 bulk background @xcite . here",
    "we extend that analysis to brane motion and graviton motion in @xmath1 and @xmath64 .",
    "we start by rewriting equation ( [ geodesic r null ] ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66 defines a kind of  effective potential of a graviton \" , and @xmath67 defines the  impact parameter \" .",
    "the potential impact parameter @xmath68 has the following useful interpretation : for a graviton to reach the point @xmath9 , it must have a impact parameter @xmath69 greater than or equal to @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath70 this is referred to as the _ condition of accessibility _ @xcite .",
    ": the effective potential ( [ effective poten ] ) for the various values of @xmath71 are @xmath72 and are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "clearly none of the potential curves have turning points , i.e if a graviton escape from the brane ( domain wall or brane with matter ) into an anti - de sitter bulk , it will not return to the brane .",
    "for @xmath13 we have a horizon at @xmath73 .",
    "[ poten diagram mu=0 ]    : the effective potential ( [ effective poten ] ) for the various values of @xmath71 are @xmath74 the case where @xmath0 is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "both the @xmath11 and @xmath13 cases look similar to @xmath13 when @xmath20 ( see figure 1 ) , i.e they have no turning points .",
    "the horizons for all @xmath71 s are given by ( [ horizon ] ) .",
    "[ poten diagram black k=+1 ]      the turning point on figure 2 , is at @xmath75 which implies a maximum effective potential of @xmath76    combining this with the condition of accessibility ( [ cond .",
    "acces ] ) , we can summarize the qualitative features of the trajectories of gravitons emitted in the @xmath64 bulk with @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) as follows :    when a graviton is emitted near the horizon @xmath77 ( i.e. at some point @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) , it will :    1 .",
    "escape to infinity when @xmath80 2 .   or return when @xmath81    equation ( [ cond.ret ] ) in effect gives us the _ condition of return _ for a graviton emitted near the bulk horizon @xmath77 .",
    "the lower limit arise from the fact that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive constants , and hence @xmath82 .",
    "clearly we can only expect returning gravitons at early times when @xmath83 when the effective potential is increasing .",
    "when a graviton is emitted at @xmath84 it will escape to infinity ( since @xmath68 is decreasing ) .",
    "for a gravitational signal to escape from the brane , it must move faster than the brane with respect to an observer in the bulk .",
    "thus the relative velocity of the gravitational signal @xmath85 must be greater than the relative velocity of the brane @xmath86 at the point of emission @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , we now seek to obtain the relative velocities of the gravitational signal and the brane .",
    "we first obtain the relative velocity of the gravitational signal by dividing equation ( [ geodesic t ] ) into equation ( [ geodesic r null ] ) , and then taking the square root to find @xmath87 we see that this equation will hold if the condition of accessibility ( [ cond",
    ". acces ] ) is satisfied ( where we made use of ( [ effective poten ] ) and ( [ impact param ] ) ) . the velocity will be zero when @xmath88 , i.e. we will have a turning point for a gravitational signal .",
    "next we find the relative velocity of the brane by substituting equation ( [ dt / dt 2 ] ) for @xmath89 into ( [ jc isomat 1 ] ) , @xmath90 \\left[f_k(r_b)dt^2-f_k^{-1}(r_b)dr_b^2\\right],\\ ] ] which on simplification yields @xmath91 the equation for the relative velocity of the brane will only hold if @xmath92 in the limit of @xmath93 this imply that @xmath94 and in the limit of @xmath95 we must have @xmath96 .",
    "we are therefore only considering positive dark radiation .",
    "the ratio of the two relative velocities is then given by @xmath97    we seek to find the conditions of escape , and therefore we only consider the position of the brane and the energy density at the time of emission , i.e. @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "the graviton will have the same position as the brane at the bulk time of emission .",
    "a gravitational signal can be emitted if and only if @xmath100 , that is when @xmath101 which after simplification reduces to @xmath102 or @xmath103 this condition can be considered as the _ condition of escape _ , that is the condition which needs to be satisfied for a graviton to escape from the brane .",
    "when @xmath104 we have the condition @xmath105 which implies that the graviton is stuck on the brane and therefore appears to be moving with the brane at the same relative velocity . in the case when @xmath106 , the gravitational signal is lagging the brane .",
    "this is clearly not possible .",
    "the only case which showed the possibility of emitting a graviton with it returning to the brane , is @xmath0 when @xmath21 .",
    "the potential diagram for this case has a classical potential form ( see @xcite and figure 2 ) which meant that if a graviton is emitted from the brane at @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 ) it would return if the condition ( [ cond.ret ] ) is satisfied . comparing the velocities of the graviton and the brane we were able to determine that a graviton will be able to escape from the brane if the condition ( [ cond escape ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the condition for a graviton to escape from the brane at some early time ( when @xmath79 ) and return , is then given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this condition can also be expressed in terms of the 5-dimensional fundamental mass scale @xmath110 , by using the relationship @xmath111 , namely @xmath112    since the impact parameter has no physical significance , we rather use the conditions above to find the relationship between parameters that do have physical significance .",
    "we find that the conditions of escape and return impose the following restrictions on the dark radiation @xmath19 ( schwarzschild - like mass ) @xmath113^{-1},\\ ] ] for all @xmath114 .",
    "this in turn tells us that we may only have returning gravitons before the brane reaches the point @xmath115 , where using ( [ rt ] ) we have the condition @xmath116^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    we can realistically only expect emitted gravitons to return to the brane at very early times ( @xmath117 ) when @xmath118 and thus @xmath119 . at late times",
    "( @xmath120 ) we are essentially looking at a domain wall moving in an @xmath1 space where gravitons do not return to the brane ( see appendix ) . in the limit @xmath117 the restrictions above reduce to @xmath121 and hence @xmath122 the upper limit for the dark radiation @xmath19 obtained here still require further investigation , especially in the light of the nucleosynthesis limits @xcite .",
    "we see that there exist a small window of opportunity , before the brane reaches @xmath115 , for gravitons to be emitted from the brane and then return to it .",
    "after the brane reaches @xmath115 , all gravitons emitted never return to the brane .",
    "an alternative might be to look at a bulk with some sort of field ( dilatonic etc . ) which forces the path back to the brane when it has gone beyond @xmath115 .",
    "another possibility is to have a black hole on the brane that will give us the required curvature .",
    "black holes on the brane have been consider by a number of authors ( see @xcite ) most notably in the context of causality , by @xcite .",
    "another issue that needs investigation , is that of conservation of energy for a brane that is radiating these graviton .",
    "clearly the form ( [ jc isomat 2 ] ) does not take into consideration the gravitons that are emitted .",
    "radiating braneworlds have been considered in @xcite and @xcite , which might show more promising results .",
    "the mechanisms that could produce gravitons with sufficient energy to leave the brane has also as yet not been explored properly .    in conclusion , there are two important aspect of escaping gravitational signals . in ",
    "4 we clearly saw that the condition of return does not depend on the type of brane that we choose , but rather on the type of bulk ( i.e. on its 5-d spacetime ) .",
    "we also discovered that the condition of escape depends on the type of brane we choose and is independent of the bulk space time .",
    "we note that no matter which values of @xmath19 ( @xmath64 ) and charge @xmath123 ( reissner - nordstrm ) we choose , the escape condition still stays the same .",
    "the condition of escape is also indepent of the curvature values @xmath71 .",
    "we have thus shown that there are certain conditions which first needs to be satisfied before one may assume that a signal can escape and then return to the brane .",
    "two important conditions need to be satisfied , firstly we need a condition under which a graviton can escape from the brane ( or be captured by the brane ) , and secondly the conditions which allow it to return to the brane .",
    "furthermore , these two conditions together restrict gravitons to escaping and returning to the brane before the brane reaches a point @xmath115 in the bulk .",
    "if all of these conditions are not satisfied one can not expect to have causally connected points through the bulk .",

    "in this section we give the results for the special case where we are considering a empty brane ( domain wall ) moving in an @xmath1 bulk .",
    "when the bulk is anti - de sitter @xmath1 , i.e @xmath20 , one can readily obtain the solutions of the null geodesic equations ( [ geodesic t])-([geodesic r null ] ) . for @xmath11 the solutions are @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 the @xmath128 sign in @xmath129 holds when @xmath130 , the @xmath131 sign when @xmath132 .    in the case where @xmath13 , the solutions are @xmath133 and @xmath134 where the initial conditions are @xmath135 and @xmath136    similarly for @xmath0 the solutions are @xmath137 where @xmath138    the solutions to the geodesic equation for the radial coordinate @xmath139 in terms of the global bulk time @xmath8 , for all @xmath140 and @xmath141 , are given by @xmath142      when one considers a domain wall ( i.e. @xmath143 ) moving in an anti - de sitter bulk ( @xmath20 ) , the modified friedmann equation ( [ matter frw eqn ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath144 the solutions of these , in terms of the proper time on the brane @xmath40 , are given in kraus @xcite .",

    "we can interpreted this condition as the graviton being confined to the brane and therefore having the same coordinate in the bulk .",
    "we can restate this condition in terms of the impact parameter @xmath171      when @xmath172 the geodesic equation is not the same as the equation of motion .",

    "we can therefore see from figure a5 that no gravitational signals return to the brane at late times .      in the @xmath11 and @xmath13 cases we see that the possibility of @xmath174 also gives paths that are different to the brane s path .",
