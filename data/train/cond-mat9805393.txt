    "in the second half of the 1920 s the founding fathers of quantum mechanics were mainly concerned with the understanding of the physical world on an atomic scale . in particular the study of the spectra of atomic hydrogen and helium led , besides the formulation of the famous schrdinger equation @xcite and the interpretation of the wavefunction as a probability amplitude @xcite , to the exclusion principle @xcite or more generally the ( anti)symmetrization of the wavefunction in the case of particles with ( half)integer spin @xcite .",
    "this important postulate of modern quantum theory divides all particles into two distinct families , which are now of course known as fermions and bosons , respectively .    already before the discovery of the ( anti)symmetrization requirement , it was shown on statistical grounds only @xcite that under extreme conditions ideal gases of these indistinguishable particles have also remarkable features on a macroscopic scale .",
    "furthermore , in the case of an interacting gas even more stunning phenomena may occur , however weak the interaction .",
    "a well - known example in this context is superconductivity . in a superconducting metal",
    "an attractive interaction between two electrons with opposite momenta causes an instability of the fermi - surface and the formation of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the latter are allowed to move freely through the lattice resulting in a superconducting current and a vanishing resistance .",
    "according to the sucessful bcs - theory @xcite describing this , the attractive interaction is the result of a phonon exchange process .",
    "it is , however , believed that due to the weakness of this interaction only critical temperatures up to about 30 k are obtainable .",
    "therefore , the underlying mechanism for the high - temperature superconductors can not be explained in this way and is today still a very active field of investigation .",
    "although the bcs - theory shows that superconductivity can in a certain sense be regarded as a result of a bose - einstein condensation @xcite of the cooper pairs , the most striking example of this condensation process was until recently always associated with the superfluid phase of liquid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the characteristics of superfluidity can be explained if the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations differs from the particle - like dispersion @xmath1 and is linear for small momenta @xcite . to see that this feature indeed leads to superfluidity",
    ", we consider the situation of liquid @xmath0he in a very long cylindrical pipe moving with velocity * v * along its symmetry axis @xcite . describing the strongly interacting bose liquid in the pipe as an assembly of noninteracting quasiparticles in a state of thermal equilibrium , we find from the usual methods of statistical mechanics that in the laboratory frame the number of quasiparticles with momentum @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 is given by @xmath4    the velocity * v * is still arbitrary at this point , but its magnitude has an upper bound because the occupation numbers @xmath5 must be positive .",
    "therefore , we require for all @xmath6 that @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the total momentum @xmath8 carried along with the walls of the pipe , is at low temperatures @xmath9 clearly much smaller than the momentum @xmath10 that we obtain when the whole liquid containing @xmath11 atoms is moving rigidly with the walls .",
    "hence , if the dispersion relation is linear , i.e. , @xmath12 , we conclude by a galilean transformation that the fluid can have a stationary ( frictionless ) flow if the velocity is small enough and obeys @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "herewith , both the existence of superfluidity as well as a critical velocity above which the phenomenon can not take place is explained .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the above argument is semiclassical and predicts that a superflow is absolutely stable if the condition @xmath13 is satisfied .",
    "this is incorrect in principle , because the superflow can actually decay by means of quantum and thermal fluctuations and is therefore only metastable @xcite . as we will see below",
    ", the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations on the semiclassical picture is a recurrent theme throughout the following .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the required linear behavior of the dispersion relation was first derived on the basis of a microscopic theory by bogoliubov @xcite and was subsequently put on a firm basis by beliaev @xcite , hugenholtz and pines @xcite , and gavoret and nozires @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , it was also shown to be valid at nonzero temperatures by lee and yang @xcite using the pseudopotential method @xcite , and more rigorously by hohenberg and martin @xcite and popov @xcite using field - theoretical methods . at this point",
    "it is important to mention also the work of nepomnyashchi and nepomnyashchi , who explicitly showed that the linear dispersion of the elementary excitations also survives if the infrared divergencies in the perturbation theory are taken into account exactly @xcite .    from these famous papers",
    "the linear dispersion at long wavelengths in a bose system with short - range interactions is therefore well established . however , to actually calculate its velocity @xmath14 from first principles is not feasible in general and in particular not for the strongly interacting @xmath0he liquid . to achieve that we have to consider a dilute bose gas , for which we can rely on the weakness of the interactions or more precisely on the smallness of the gas parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density and @xmath17 the positive @xmath18-wave scattering length of the particles in the gas . unfortunately however , until recently bose - einstein condensation in a gas was never realized experimentally and the theory of the weakly interacting bose gas @xcite could therefore not be applied to any real system .",
    "this situation changed dramatically in the summer of 1995 when within a few months three experimental groups reported the observation of bose - einstein condensation in a vapor of spin - polarized @xmath19rb @xcite , @xmath20li @xcite , and @xmath21na @xcite atoms .",
    "historically , the first step towards the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in a dilute gas was made in 1980 by silvera and walraven @xcite , when they demonstrated the stabilization of spin - polarized atomic hydrogen .",
    "after this pioneering experiment , the combined efforts of several experimental and theoretical groups around the world led to a detailed understanding of the atomic and statistical properties of this new quantum system @xcite .",
    "moreover , just before the reports on the above mentioned experiment with the rubidium vapor , doubly spin - polarized atomic hydrogen gases still held the record in achieving the required high densities and low temperatures and were generally considered to be the most promising candidates for the observation of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "although , the latter expectation has clearly been proven wrong , it is fair to say that the sucessful experiments with the alkali vapors would not have been possible without the knowledge acquired by the atomic hydrogen community . in particular the development of magnetic traps @xcite and evaporative cooling techniques",
    "@xcite has turned out to be of crucial importance for the actual achievement of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .    at present ,",
    "the most important reason for the interest in degenerate bose gases is that we can study the nonequilibrium dynamics of these trapped gases in such detail that experimental results can be directly confronted to microscopic many - body theories . in particular , the dynamics of condensate formation and the collective modes of an inhomogeneous bose condensed gas are two topics that have received considerable attention in the last three years and on which the present paper is also focussed .",
    "more generally , however , the aim of this paper is to develop with the techniques of quantum field theory a unified nonequilibrium theory for trapped atomic gases that is capable of treating the dynamics of the gas , not only in the normal and superfluid phases , but also during the phase transition itself . in agreement with the above goal of the paper ,",
    "we refrain from reviewing other approaches that can and actually have been applied to the topics of interest here .",
    "nevertheless , we have included a rather large amount of references . in this manner",
    "we aim to give , to the best of our knowledge , proper reference to important contributions to this field of physics .",
    "furthermore , we also want to provide the reader with additional ( and sometimes more advanced ) literature that may be useful for a deeper understanding of various technical details , even though this is not necessary for a first reading , since the paper is intended to be self contained and essentially only assumes a working knowledge of the methods of second quantization , the path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the hartree - fock theory of interacting many - particle systems .    the theoretical challenge that is posed by trapped atomic bose gases can be stated as follows . on the one hand the interactions between the atoms influence the one - particle wavefunctions and energies of the gas . on the other hand the same interactions also change the occupation numbers of these states .",
    "as a result of the strong coupling between these , respectively , coherent and incoherent processes , the nonequilibrium dynamics of the gas is in principle quite complicated and requires a quantum kinetic theory that simultaneously incorporates both effects of the interactions .",
    "such a quantum kinetic theory has recently been developed by gardiner and zoller on the basis of a perturbative treatment of the master equation for the many - body density matrix @xcite .",
    "below we ultimately also arrive at a quantum kinetic theory , but this is achieved by using field - theoretical tools to derive a single fokker - planck equation that nevertheless describes both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of the gas . in principle we could , of course , also first derive a master equation and subsequently the same fokker - planck equation by making use of well - known procedures from quantum optics .",
    "however , we believe that the approach presented here is more direct and , most importantly , much more convenient if we systematically want to go beyond the pseudopotential method that is not sufficiently accurate for our purposes and that is used by gardiner and zoller .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cl ] we start with a discussion of an ideal bose gas in a trap . in sec .",
    "[ bqd ] we consider the isolated case , but in sec .",
    "[ bqdr ] we couple the gas in the trap also to a thermal reservoir .",
    "the reason for treating the ideal bose gas is that in this way we are able to introduce most easily all the mathematical tools that are required for the discussion of an interacting bose gas .",
    "the necessary extensions for an interacting gas are then developed in secs .",
    "[ semicl ] , [ quant ] and [ inhom ] . in these sections",
    "we mainly focus on the problem of understanding the dynamics of condensate formation , because the theory needs to be the most accurate and therefore the most general for this problem . in secs .",
    "[ semicl ] and [ quant ] we first treat a homogeneous bose gas and in sec .",
    "[ inhom ] we then turn to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "discussing the homogeneous bose gas first is a useful intermediate step , because as a result of the translational symmetry the coherent dynamics of the gas involves only the one - particle energies and not their wavefunctions .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics is nontrivial . to get a better understanding of the timescales involved in bose - einstein condensation we therefore first consider in sec .",
    "[ semicl ] the semiclassical dynamics of the gas , in which fluctuations of the order parameter are neglected .",
    "roughly speaking , the semiclassical theory is the nonequilibrium generalization of the bogoliubov theory .",
    "next , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ quant ] the full quantum theory that incorporates also fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "[ inhom ] is devoted to the quantum kinetic theory for inhomogeneous bose gases . after our experience with the homogeneous bose gas we can easily derive the desired fokker - planck equation for an interacting bose gas trapped in an external potential .",
    "in contrast to homogeneous gases there are now , however , two cases to consider . if the density of the gas is sufficiently small , the average interaction between the atoms is always smaller than the energy splitting between the one - particle states in the trap and the coherent dynamics of the gas can be neglected .",
    "this most simple situation corresponds to the weak - coupling limit and is presented in sec .",
    "experimentally , the weak - coupling limit is essentially only realized for atomic @xmath20li due to the effectively attractive interatomic interactions of this element .",
    "as an application of the weak - coupling theory , we therefore discuss in sec .",
    "[ neg ] the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation in a gas with effectively attractive interations in some detail .",
    "it is only after that , that we turn our attention to the most complicated strong - coupling limit and discuss three other applications of our general nonequilibrium approach .",
    "since it follows most naturally from the theory presented in sec .",
    "[ neg ] , we first briefly consider in sec .",
    "[ diff ] an interesting ( zero temperature ) property of a condensate , namely the so - called ` diffusion ' of its phase . in sec .",
    "[ sc ] we then return to the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation and in sec .  [ cm ] we finally present also a theory for the collective modes of a trapped bose gas .",
    "we end the paper in sec .",
    "[ conc ] with some conclusions and an outlook .",
    "before we start with the full problem of bose - einstein condensation in an interacting gas , we first consider in this section the case of an ideal bose gas . in particular , we consider an isolated , noninteracting bose gas in an external trapping potential @xmath22 with one - particle states @xmath23 and one - particle energies @xmath24 . in this manner",
    "we try to give an introduction to the schwinger - keldysh formalism for nonequilibrium processes @xcite that we are going to use throughout this paper .",
    "a review of the schwinger - keldysh formalism has already been given by danielewicz @xcite , but he uses the operator language which turns out to be less convenient for our purposes .",
    "instead , we need a formulation in terms of functional integrals @xcite . in addition",
    ", we also couple this system to a reservoir in a way that is familiar from the caldeira - leggett model for a particle experiencing friction @xcite .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to explain how dissipation , and as a result relaxation , is incorporated in the schwinger - keldysh formalism .",
    "this is especially important in sec .",
    "[ quant ] , when we discuss the effect of thermal fluctuations on the semiclassical theory of bose - einstein condensation .      in textbooks an ideal bose gas",
    "is generally discussed in terms of the average occupation numbers of the one - particle states @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "given the density matrix @xmath25 of the gas at an initial time @xmath26 , these occupation numbers obey @xmath27~,\\ ] ] with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the usual ( heisenberg picture ) creation and annihilation operators of second quantization @xcite , respectively . because the hamiltonian of the gas @xmath30 commutes with the number operators @xmath31",
    ", the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system is trivial and the average occupation numbers are at all times equal to their value at the initial time @xmath26 . if we are also interested in fluctuations , it is convenient to introduce the eigenstates of the number operators , i.e. , @xmath32 and to consider the full probability distribution @xmath33~,\\ ] ] which is again independent of time for an ideal bose gas .",
    "the average occupation numbers are then determined by @xmath34 and the fluctuations can be obtained from similar expressions .    as mentioned in the introduction , we are in the following also interested in the phase dynamics of the gas . to study that it is necessary to introduce so - called coherent states , which are eigenstates of the annihilation operators @xmath29 and are much used both in the field of quantum optics @xcite as well as condensed matter physics @xcite . for our purposes it is even more convenient to consider eigenstates of the field operator @xmath35 an eigenstate of @xmath36 with eigenvalue @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 and is clearly also an eigenstate of @xmath29 with eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "the latter can also be proved immediately by noting that the equal - time commutation relation @xmath40 = \\hat{1}$ ] implies that @xmath29 acts as @xmath41 on these states . moreover , from their definition it can easily be shown that these eigenstates obey the inner product @xmath42 and the completeness relation @xmath43d[\\phi]~ \\frac{|\\phi;t\\rangle \\langle\\phi;t| }                              { \\langle\\phi;t|\\phi;t\\rangle } = \\hat{1}~,\\ ] ] if the integration measure of the functional integral is taken to be @xmath44d[\\phi ] = \\int \\prod_{\\alpha }                                \\frac{d\\phi^*_{\\alpha } d\\phi_{\\alpha}}{2\\pi i}~.\\ ] ]    in analogy with the occupation number representation in eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) , we can now obtain a completely different description of the bose gas by making use of the above coherent states and considering the probability distribution @xmath45 =      { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\hat{\\rho}(t_0 )                 \\frac{|\\phi;t\\rangle \\langle\\phi;t| }                     { \\langle\\phi;t|\\phi;t\\rangle }              \\right]~.\\ ] ] although we expect that this probability distribution is again independent of time , let us nevertheless proceed to derive its equation of motion in a way that can be generalized in secs .",
    "[ semicl ] and [ quant ] when we consider an interacting bose gas .",
    "first , we need to expand the density matrix @xmath25 in the above coherent states . for an isolated bose gas",
    "it is appropriate to take an initial density matrix that commutes with the total number operator @xmath46 and we then find the expression @xmath47d[\\phi_0]~",
    "\\rho[|\\phi_0|^2;t_0 ]                      \\frac{|\\phi_0;t_0\\rangle \\langle\\phi_0;t_0| }                          { \\langle\\phi_0;t_0|\\phi_0;t_0\\rangle}~,\\ ] ] in which the expansion coefficients @xmath48 $ ] only depend on the amplitude of the field @xmath49 but not on its phase .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the initial state of the gas does not have a spontaneously broken @xmath50 symmetry . since we are ultimately interested in the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation it is of course crucial not to consider an initial state in which this symmetry is already broken and we therefore never use such initial states in the following .",

    "the approximation that we will make here is the so - called many - body t - matrix approximation that has recently been reviewed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this approximation is that due to the smallness of the gasparameter @xmath15 it is very unlikely for three or more particles to be within the range of the interaction and we only need to take account of all possible two - body processes taking place in the gas .",

    "the effect of the bose enhancement factors can be seen as a result of the fact that the scattering wavefunction of the two colliding atoms has to be matched to the many - body wavefunction of the gas at large interatomic distances @xcite .",
    "seen in this manner , it will be clear that this effect is not small in the gasparameter @xmath15 and can not be neglected beforehand if we aim to include all two - body processes in the gas .",

    "this part of the evolution can be accurately described by a quantum boltzmann equation , in which in a selfconsistent manner collisions between the atoms lead to changes in the occupation numbers @xmath286 and these changes in their turn affect the mean - field corrections to the energies @xmath297 . as long as the gas is outside the critical region",
    ", however , these mean - field corrections are constant and we simply have @xmath414 . hence",
    ", if initially not enough energy is removed , the gas always remains in this regime and then typically evolves towards equilibrium on a time scale of @xmath415 , which near the critical temperature is of @xmath416 @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand sufficient energy is removed initially , the gas enters the critical region and the second stage towards bose - einstein condensation begins . in this second stage , the gas first develops the required instability for the phase transition .",
    "physically , the instability is a result of the fact that in the critical region , fluctuations tend to decrease the mean - field corrections to the energies of the low - momentum states with @xmath417 @xcite , which makes it possible for the zero - momentum state to acquire an energy which is less than the instantaneous chemical potential .",
    "it is then clearly energetically favorable to put a macroscopic number of particles in that state .",
    "it is important to note that for this instability mechanism , it is crucial that the typical time scale on which the mean - field corrections are established is only of @xmath418 and therefore much faster than the time scale on which elastic collisions can change the occupations numbers . in that sense",
    "it can be said that bose - einstein condensation is ` nucleated ' on a time scale of @xmath419 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen above , incoherent collisions alone can not lead to a macroscopic occupation of the zero - momentum state . after the gas has become unstable , the actual growth of the condensate density is therefore in the semiclassical theory caused by a coherent depletion of the low - lying excited states in favor of the one - particle ground state . at the end of the second stage , which also has a duration of @xmath416 ,",
    "the gas has thus acquired a highly nonequilibrium energy distribution and has to come to equilibrium in a third and final stage .",
    "this last stage of the condensation process is again of a kinetic nature and can be accurately described by a quantum boltzmann equation for the bogoliubov quasiparticles @xcite . due to the linear dispersion of these quasiparticles at long wavelengths",
    "the typical time scale for relaxation towards equilibrium is exceptionally long and of @xmath420 , as was shown by eckern in the context of spin - polarized atomic hydrogen @xcite .    for completeness sake",
    ", we should mention that kagan , svistunov , and shlyapnikov have put forward a different semiclassical picture and assert that during the second , coherent stage of the evolution , the gas does not form a condensate but , just as in a two dimensional gas , only a quasicondensate @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this implies that the gas does not acquire a nonzero average of the annihilation operator of the zero - momentum state @xmath421 alone , but only of the sum @xmath422 , where @xmath423 is a momentum cut - off of @xmath424 @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical picture is however not confirmed by our microscopic calculation , because from the above discussion of the instability mechanism it is clear that a possible instability for a quasicondensate is always preceeded by an instability for a real condensate since a removal of the long - wavelength fluctuations with @xmath425 always increases the mean - field corrections to the energies @xmath297 .",
    "the semiclassical theory neglects in particular the effect of thermal fluctuations on the condensate dynamics , which are nevertheless anticipated to be very important for conditions near the critical temperature when a large fraction of the gas is still uncondensed . for a quantitative comparison with experiments that are presently being performed",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of these thermal fluctuations is therefore clearly of interest .",
    "there are also several theoretical reasons why we need to consider the effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "although the semiclassical theory of bose - einstein condensation gives important insight into the dynamics of this phase transition , it has two important drawbacks .",
    "first , it makes a sharp distinction between the kinetic and coherent stages of the evolution , which in principle of course overlap with each other .",
    "second , the discussion of the growth of the condensate actually makes use of the presence of fluctuations , without taking these explicitly into account .",
    "this is due to the fact that at the semiclassical level we always have a solution to the equations of motion in which the gas remains at all times in the metastable , uncondensed phase . by considering the effect of thermal fluctuations , both these problems",
    "can indeed be resolved and we finally arrive at a single fokker - planck equation that describes all the three stages of the condensation process simultaneously . how this is achieved is reviewed next .",

    "although we have up to now primarily been focussed on the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation itself , it is interesting that we have in fact also arrived at an accurate discription of the collective modes of a condensed gas at nonzero temperatures .",
    "since these collective modes are receiving much attention at present , we now briefly want to discuss how such a description emerges from our fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "since most experiments at present are performed in the collisionless limit , we consider only this limit here .",
    "it is in principle possible , however , to derive the hydrodynamic equations of motions as well @xcite .",
    "let us for simplicitly first assume that the temperature of the gas is sufficiently far below the critical temperature that the many - body t matrix is well approximated by the two - body t matrix , but not so low that the hartree - fock approximation is no longer valid .",
    "in this regime we have that @xmath740 and the dynamics of the noncondensed part of the gas is again determined by the collisionless quantum boltzmann equation given in eq .",
    "( [ clqbe ] ) , where the total density now consists of two contributions @xmath741 the dynamics of the condensate follows again from the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath742 which can be rewritten as the continuity equation @xmath743 together with the josephson relation for the superfluid velocity @xmath744 here , we used that @xmath745 , @xmath746 , and have applied the thomas - fermi approximation , which is appropriate in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "it will presumably not come as a surprise that these coupled equations for @xmath717 , @xmath640 , and @xmath747 can be shown to fulfill the kohn theorem exactly .",
    "this is an important constraint on any theory for the collective modes of a trapped gas , as stressed recently by zaremba , griffin , and nikuni @xcite .    as we have mentioned previously , in trapped atomic gases it is possible to cool the gas even to such low temperatures that @xmath748 .",
    "in this regime it is no longer allowed to use the hartree - fock approximation and we must use the bogoliubov approximation instead . this",
    "is achieved as follows . in the hartree - fock approximation",
    "we have taken for the probability distribution @xmath62 $ ] the separable form @xmath749 p_1[\\phi'^*,\\phi';t]$ ] .",
    "for such an ansatz the @xmath50 invariance of the theory requires in fact that @xmath62 $ ] is invariant under independent phase transformations on @xmath750 and @xmath751 .",
    "clearly this ansatz is therefore too symmetric in general , since it is only required that @xmath62 $ ] is invariant under simultaneous phase transformations on @xmath750 and @xmath751 . for such more general solutions the probability distributions for the condensed and noncondensed parts of the gas",
    "are then given by @xmath749 \\equiv \\int d[\\phi'^*]d[\\phi']~ p[\\phi^*,\\phi;t]$ ] and @xmath505 \\equiv \\int d[\\phi_0^*]d[\\phi_0]~ p[\\phi^*,\\phi;t]$ ] , respectively .",
    "the fokker - planck equations for these probability distributions can thus be found from integrating the general fokker - planck equation in eq .",
    "( [ fpgen ] ) first over @xmath502 and subsequently over @xmath49 .",
    "taking care that we do not double count effects of the interaction that are already accounted for in the various selfenergies , we find after a gradient expansion that the fokker - planck equation for the condensate is identical to eq .",

    "we can then show that the wigner distribution for the bogoliubov quasiparticles obeys the expected collisionless boltzmann equation @xmath755 with the dispersion given by @xmath756 note that this shows that the distribution function @xmath717 gives the number of bogoliubov quasiparticles with momentum @xmath2 at position @xmath719 in the frame in which the superfluid velocity vanishes @xcite .",
    "note also that the above derivation of the bogoliubov theory is particle - number conserving since the probability distribution @xmath62 $ ] is explicitly @xmath50 invariant .",
    "it is therefore equivalent to the approach recently put forward by gardiner @xcite , and castin and dum @xcite . more important for our purposes",
    "is that the coupled equations for @xmath717 , @xmath640 , and @xmath747 can again be shown to fulfill the kohn theorem exactly .",
    "we therefore believe that they give an accurate description of the collisionless modes of a trapped bose condensed gas , that may be able to explain the existing discrepancy between theory and experiment .    as a first step towards this goal",
    "we here consider the time - dependent hartree - fock theory for the collective modes of the bose condensed gas , in which the collisionless boltzmann equation in eq .",
    "( [ clqbe ] ) is coupled to the nonlinear schrdinger equation in eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) .",
    "it turns out that a numerical determination of the eigenmodes of the collisionless boltzmann equation is rather difficult .",
    "therefore , we have recently proposed a variational approach to solve these coupled equations @xcite . denoting the anisotropic harmonic trapping potential used in the experiments @xcite by @xmath757 , we first of all take for the condensate wavefunction the gaussian _ ansatz _ @xmath758 with the functions @xmath759 describing the ` breathing ' of the condensate in three independent directions . clearly , this is the anisotropic generalization of the gaussian _ ansatz _ that we used in sec .",
    "[ neg ] to study the stability of a condensate with negative scattering length .",
    "although it is not immediately obvious that such an _ ansatz _ is also appropriate in the strong - coupling regime of interest here , it has been shown by perez - garcia _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that at zero temperature the assumption of a gaussian density profile nevertheless leads to rather accurate results for the frequencies of the collective modes .",
    "we therefore anticipate that at nonzero temperatures the same will be the case .",
    "next we also need an _ ansatz _ for the distribution function @xmath717 of the thermal cloud . in ref .",

    "the functional form of the distribution function is physically motivated by the following reasons .",
    "first , by integrating over the momentum @xmath120 we see that the time - dependent density profile of the noncondensed cloud @xmath561 is a time - independent function of @xmath766 , as desired .",
    "second , for such a density profile we must have that the local velocity @xmath767 is given by @xmath768 . third , we want the equilibrium distribution to be only anisotropic in coordinate space , and not in momentum space . this explains the appearance of the factor @xmath769 in the exponent .    using the ideal gas result for the number of condensate particles and substituting the above _ ansatz _ for the condensate wavefunction and the wigner distribution function into the nonlinear schrdinger and collisionless boltzmann equations , it is straightforward but somewhat tedious to derive the six coupled equations of motion for the ` breathing ' parameters @xmath759 and @xmath761 .",
    "linearizing these equations around the equilibrium solutions @xmath770 and @xmath763 , respectively , we can then also obtain the desired eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies . the results of this calculation for the trap parameters of jin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ rb87 ] together with the experimental data .",
    "note that the trap has a disk geometry with @xmath771 and @xmath772 . due to the axial symmetry",
    ", the modes of the gas can be labeled by the usual quantum number @xmath591 that describes the angular dependence around the @xmath470-axis . on the whole",
    "there appears to be a quite reasonable agreement between this simple theory and experiment .",
    "the only exceptions are the two data point almost halfway in between the in and out - of - phase @xmath773 modes .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that experimentally both modes are excited simultaneously @xcite . to make sure of this ,",
    "however , we need to determine the oscillator strength of the various modes .",
    "work in this direction is in progress and will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been twofold .",
    "first , we have derived a single fokker - planck equation for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "this fokker - planck equation is capable of describing simultaneously the coherent and incoherent processes taking place in the gas and can be used for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous situations .",
    "it can be derived in a very natural way in the schwinger - keldysh formalism , to which we have therefore also tried to give an introduction .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is here primarily used to study the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation in homogeneous and inhomogeneous atomic bose gases . in particular , by treating both the weak - coupling and strong - coupling limits of the theory , we have been able to consider not only trapped atomic bose gases with effectively attractive but also with effectively repulsive interactions , which leads to a better understanding of the fundamental difference between the physics in these two cases .",
    "although we have only applied the schwinger - keldysh formalism to atomic bose gases here , it can also be used to study nonequilibrium problems in trapped fermi gases .",
    "an example is the study of the timescale for the formation of cooper pairs in atomic @xmath774li @xcite , which due to the anomalously large and negative value of the interatomic scattering length for this species , is of considerable interest at present .",
    "second , and maybe most importantly , with our fokker - planck equation we have been able to make some theoretical progress on three topics in the field of bose condensed atomic gases where there exists at present a discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "we refer here to the experiments on the formation of the condensate , on the spectrum of the collisionless modes and on the collapse of a condensate with negative scattering length .",
    "the main difficulty with the first topic is that the experiments are performed in the strong - coupling limit . in the language of quantum optics",
    "this implies that we are dealing with a multi - mode situation .",
    "although this complicates the theory considerably , it also makes the physics involved much richer because coherent interaction effects now compete with the incoherent collisions . in this regime",
    "we may therefore hope to study in some detail the formation of topological defects in the wake of a phase transition , which turns out to be an important problem in cosmology as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent experiments have shown that by a sinusoidal modulation of the trapping potential it is possible to adiabatically cycle through the phase transition @xcite . a theoretical description of this experiment is easily obtained within our strong - coupling formalism .",
    "we only have to replace @xmath22 by @xmath775 .",
    "the second discrepancy between theory and experiment is associated with the eigenfrequencies of the collisionless modes of a bose condensed gas at nonzero temperatures , when also a considerable density of noncondensed atoms is present in the trap .",
    "the most accurate theory that has recently been applied to this problem , is an approximate many - body t - matrix calculation in which the noncondensate part of the gas is assumed to have no dynamics @xcite . due to this last feature",
    "the modes of the gas are essentially the modes of a condensate in the effective potential @xmath776 , which near the center of the trap has effectively smaller harmonic oscillator frequencies than the external trapping potential .",
    "therefore , the kohn theorem is not satisfied .",
    "as we have shown , this problem can be overcome if the dynamics of the noncondensed part of the gas is determined by an appropriate collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "furthermore , by including the collision terms we can also find the damping of the long - wavelength modes of interest in a similar way as kavoulakis , pethick , and smith have done for the normal state of the gas @xcite .",
    "the last theoretical challenge that we have touched upon is an accurate determination of the number of atoms that remain after a single collapse of a condensate with negative scattering length .",
    "we have argued that this in principle requires the solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation in combination with a rate equation for the number of condensate particles .",
    "in addition , we have indicated how we can find an approximate description of the dynamics of the collapse that systematically improves upon our gaussian results . as in the two previous problems ,",
    "work is in progress to numerically investigate if the theory presented in this paper is indeed sufficiently accurate to resolve the discrepancies with experiment .",
    "although we can not be sure about the outcome of these studies at present , we believe that the many - body t - matrix approximation used throughout this paper is an excellent starting point in all three cases , and that our fokker - planck approach to the dynamics of weakly interacting bose gases presents a convenient framework in which to derive in a straightforward way also the necessary corrections if they turn out not to be negligible .",
