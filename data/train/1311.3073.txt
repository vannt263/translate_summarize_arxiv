    "given a small positive parameter @xmath1 , our goal in this work is to analyze the convergence of the family of solutions @xmath2 of the neumann boundary problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is uniformly bounded which respect to @xmath1 , @xmath5 denotes the unit outward normal vector field to @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the outside normal derivative .",
    "the domain @xmath8 is a thin domain with a highly oscillating boundary which is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are smooth functions , uniformly bounded by positive constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , independent of @xmath1 , satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 $ ] . noticing that @xmath18 for all @xmath19",
    ", we see that the domain @xmath20 is actually thin on the @xmath21-direction .",
    "therefore we will say that @xmath20 is collapsing to the interval @xmath22 as @xmath23 .    here",
    ", the function @xmath10 , independent on @xmath1 , establishes the lower boundary of the thin domain , and the function @xmath11 , dependent on the parameter @xmath1 , defines its upper boundary .",
    "also , allowing @xmath11 to present oscillatory behavior we obtain an oscillating thin domain @xmath20 , whose amplitude and period of the oscillations are of the same order @xmath1 , which also coincides with the order of its thickness .",
    "for instance , we may think the function @xmath11 of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] are @xmath26-functions and @xmath27 is a @xmath28-periodic and smooth function . in this case",
    ", it is clear that the functions @xmath29 and @xmath10 define the profile of the thin domain , as well as @xmath30 the amplitude of the oscillations which is given by the periodic function @xmath31 .",
    "this includes the case where the function @xmath11 is a purely periodic function , as @xmath32 , but also includes the case where the function @xmath11 exhibit a profile and amplitude of oscillations dependent on @xmath33 .",
    "we can refer the reader to @xcite for an example of this kind of locally periodic structure .",
    "in fact , we are able to treat even more general cases , see hypotheses @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the section [ pre ] .",
    "figure 1 below illustrates an example of such a thin domain that we are able to treat in this work .",
    "[ thin - domain ]    notice that the existence and uniqueness of solutions for problem ( [ p ] ) is guaranteed by lax - milgram theorem .",
    "the aim of this work is to treat the convergence aspects of the solution @xmath36 as @xmath37 , to an effective limit solution as the domain gets thinner and thinner although the oscillations becomes higher .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors combine methods from _ homogenization theory _ and _ boundary perturbation problems _ for partial differential equations to obtain the _ homogenized ( effective ) equation _ associated to . since the thin domain @xmath20 degenerates to the interval @xmath22 as @xmath1 goes to zero , an one - dimensional limiting equation is established .",
    "the respective solution , @xmath38 , is the limit of the family @xmath39 .",
    "we also have that the _ homogenized coefficient _ of the limit equation depends on a family of auxiliary solutions , capturing somehow , the oscillatory geometry of the thin domain .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general introduction to the theory of homogenization and to @xcite for a general treatise on boundary perturbation problems for partial differential equations .",
    "it is important to notice that the convergence of the sequence @xmath39 to the solution @xmath38 of the homogenized equation established in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) is only weak with respect to @xmath40-norms .",
    "in fact , weak convergence in @xmath40-norms is the best one for these kind of problems exhibiting oscillatory behavior since in @xcite , the authors show that in general strong convergence is not possible .",
    "for this reason , seeking for better convergence results , we apply an appropriate _ corrector _ approach developed by bensoussan , lions and papanicolaou in @xcite , to obtain a sort of strong convergence .",
    "the ideia is adjust the homogenized solution @xmath41 , adding suitable _ corrector functions _",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 in @xmath44 , obtaining @xmath45 here we proceed as in @xcite rescaling the lebesgue measure of @xmath46 by a factor @xmath47 in order to preserve the _ relative capacity _ of mensurable subset @xmath48 for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "our challenge here is to set a proper family of corrector functions in the way to get the desired strong convergence once the auxiliary solutions associated with the homogenized ( limiting ) equation are posed in an one - parameter family of _ representative cells_. see theorem [ theo : first - order ] for a complete statement on these results .    in such problems , where the analytical solution demands a substantial effort or is unknown , it is of interest in discussing error estimates ( in norm ) when we replace it by numerical approximations . in this sense ,",
    "the analysis performed here is fundamental in order understanding the convergence properties of the solutions of the problem .",
    "there are several works in the literature dealing with boundary value problems posed in thin domains presenting oscillating behavior . among others",
    ", we mention @xcite where asymptotic approximations of solutions to elliptic problems in thin perforated domains defined by purely periodic functions with rapidly varying thickness were studied , as well as @xcite , dealing with nonlinear monotone problems in a multidomain with a highly oscillating boundary .",
    "let us also cite @xcite where the asymptotic description of nonlinearly elastic thin films with fast - oscillating profile was successfully obtained in a context of _ @xmath49-convergence _ @xcite .",
    "we also can mention other works addressing the problem of the behavior of solutions of partial differential equations where just part of the boundary of the domain presents oscillation .",
    "this is the case in @xcite where the authors deal with the poisson equation with robin type boundary conditions in the oscillating part of the boundary .",
    "in general , the differential equation is not affected by the perturbation but the boundary condition . some very interesting interplay among the geometry of the oscillations and robin boundary conditions can be analyzed and depending on this balance , the limiting boundary condition may be of a different type .",
    "similar discussion can be found in @xcite for the navier - stokes equations with slip boundary conditions and in @xcite for nonlinear elliptic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions as well the references given there . in the case of the present paper , the effect of the oscillations at the boundary is coupled with the effect of the domain being thin . as previously observed , the oscillatory behavior considered here affect completely the limit behavior of the equation .",
    "let us also point out that thin structures with rough contours as thin rods , plates or shells , as well as fluids filling out thin domains in lubrication procedures , or even chemical diffusion process in the presence of grainy narrow strips are very common in engineering and applied sciences .",
    "the analysis of the properties of these processes taking place on them , and understanding how the micro geometry of the thin structure affects the macro properties of the material is a very relevant issue in engineering and material design .",
    "therefore , being able to obtain the limiting equation of a prototype equation like the poisson equation in different structures where the micro geometry is not necessarily smooth and being able to analyze how the different micro scales affects the limiting problem , goes in this direction and will allow the research and deep understanding in more complicated situations .",
    "in this context we also mention @xcite for some concrete applied problems .",
    "we also would like to observe that although we just treat the poisson equation with neumann boundary conditions , we also may consider other different conditions on the lateral boundaries of the thin domain while preserving the neumann type boundary condition in the upper and lower boundary .",
    "indeed , the limiting problem preserves the boundary condition .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ pre ] , we establish the functional setting for the perturbed equation and we introduce its limiting problem , and in section [ sfc ] we obtain convergence in @xmath40-norms using the corrector approach . in the appendix",
    "we show smoothness of the auxiliary solutions with respect to the perturbation on the representative cell .",
    "in the following , @xmath1 will denote a small positive parameter which will converges to @xmath50 . in order to setup the thin domain we consider a function @xmath51 \\to [ 0,\\infty)$ ] and a family of positive functions @xmath52\\to ( 0,\\infty)$ ] , satisfying the following hypothesis    * the function @xmath10 belongs to @xmath53 , it is continuous in @xmath54 $ ] and satisfies @xmath15 for some positive constant @xmath12 and all @xmath17 $ ] ; * there exist two positive constants @xmath13 , @xmath14 such that @xmath55 , \\quad \\forall \\ \\epsilon \\in ( 0,\\epsilon_0 ) .",

    "we stress for the fact that @xmath20 varies in accordance with the positive parameter @xmath1 and , when @xmath1 goes to @xmath50 , the domains @xmath20 collapse themselves to the unit interval of the real line , therefore , in order to preserve the relative capacity of a mensurable subset @xmath48 we rescale the lebesgue measure by a factor @xmath63 , i.e. , we deal with the singular measure @xmath64 widely considered in thin domains problems ( see for instance @xcite ) . with this measure",
    "we introduce the lebesgue and sobolev spaces @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the norms in these spaces will be denoted , respectivelly , by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are induced by the inner products @xmath69 and @xmath70    the @xmath71 - norms and the usual ones in @xmath44 and @xmath46 are equivalents and easily related @xmath72    the variational formulation of ( [ p ] ) is : find @xmath39 such that @xmath73 which is equivalent to find @xmath74 such that @xmath75    we also observe that the solutions @xmath36 satisfy a priori estimates uniformly in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath76 as a test function we derive from ( [ vfp ] ) and ( [ eq : vfor ] ) that @xmath77    now , in order to capture the limiting behavior of @xmath78 , as @xmath23 , we consider the sesquilinear form @xmath79 in @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 , defined in , are positive and bounded functions .",

    "\\ii ) if initially the function @xmath112 , then it is not difficult to see that @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath107 , as @xmath37 , and therefore , @xmath115 .",
    "the auxiliary functions @xmath97 introduced by the problem are originally defined in the representative cell @xmath89 , that depends on @xmath33 .",
    "such variable performs a perturbation on @xmath89 changing its height at the direction @xmath117 which also has influence on the auxiliary solution @xmath97 .",
    "since such a _ domain perturbation _ is smooth so is @xmath118 with respect to @xmath119 . in fact",
    "we are able to compute at least one derivative with respect to @xmath120 by using corollary [ papen2 ] proved in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "there we combine methods from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition a.2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) where more general results can be found .",
    "this is the reason of our smoothness assumptions to the functions @xmath10 and @xmath121 in @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , in order to consider @xmath97 as a function in the thin domain @xmath20 , with the purpose to define the corrector term @xmath122 , we first use the periodicity at variable @xmath60 to extend them to the band @xmath123 then , we properly compose them with the diffeomorphisms @xmath124 defining , at the end , the function @xmath125 finally , with some notational abuse , we consider the function @xmath126 correlating variables @xmath119 and @xmath60 of the original function @xmath116 given by . in order to simplify our notation at the analysis below we still denote functions by @xmath127    now , under these considerations , we can obtain some estimates for @xmath116 on @xmath20 .",

    "thus , using the notation introduced at , we have that @xmath134    analogously , we can introduce similar notations for the derivatives of @xmath116 with respect to variables @xmath119 , @xmath60 and @xmath117 , obtaining that the norms @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 satisfy for all @xmath129 .",
    "as we mentioned before the solutions @xmath36 of does nt converge in general in @xmath40-norms .",
    "therefore , following bensoussan , lions and papanicolaou in @xcite , we use the auxiliary solution @xmath116 to introduce the first - order corrector term @xmath138    let us still observe that the function @xmath139 defined in is not the standard corrector according to @xcite since its dependence with respect to variable @xmath140 involves the changeable auxiliary solution @xmath116 with respect to the representative cell @xmath89 whose smoothness has been discussed in section @xmath141 . as a matter of fact , we believe that this is the main contribution of our work established here .    now , we have elements to proof the following result    [ theo : first - order ] let @xmath36 be the solution of problem @xmath142 with @xmath4 satisfying @xmath143 for some @xmath144 independent of @xmath1 . consider the family of functions @xmath145 defined by @xmath146 with @xmath56 and @xmath147 satisfying hypotheses @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    if @xmath148 w-@xmath85 , then @xmath149 where @xmath139 is the first - order corrector of @xmath36 defined in , and @xmath150 is the unique solution of the homogenized equation @xmath151 with @xmath152    we have @xmath153 , for all @xmath154 .",
    "taking @xmath155 is considered to be a function of both variables @xmath140 and @xmath156 , simply by @xmath157 . ] as a test function , we obtain that @xmath158 now , performing the change of variables @xmath159 on problem , it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
