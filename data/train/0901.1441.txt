    "there is mounting datum from type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and so on@xcite have provided strong evidences for the present spatially flat and accelerated expanding universe which is dominated by dark sectors .",
    "combined analysis of the above cosmological observations support that the energy of our universe is occupied by dark energy(de ) about @xmath0 , dark matter about @xmath1 and usual baryon matter only about @xmath2 which can be described by the well known particle theory . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology ,",
    "this acceleration is attributed to an exotic form of negative pressure , the so - called de .",
    "so far , the nature of dark energy remains a mystery . theoretically , the obvious candidate for such a component is a small cosmological constant @xmath3 ( or vacuum energy ) with equation of state @xmath4 , while the cosmological model that consists of a mixture of vacuum energy and cold dark matter ( cdm ) is called lcdm ( or @xmath3 cdm ) , but it is at the expense of the difficulties associated with the fine tuning and the coincidence problems .",
    "the inspiration from inflation has suggested the idea that dark energy is due to a dynamical component with one- or multi - scalar fields , such as the quintessence@xcite , phantom@xcite , k - essence@xcite .",
    "however , a positive kinetic term in the lagrangian of quintessence dark energy model may violate the strong energy condition .",
    "on the other hand , the negative kinetic term in phantom scenario leads to some quantum instabilities such as the violation of the dominant energy condition , as well as the occurrence of the phenomenon of big rip@xcite .",
    "there are also other models , including chaplygin gas@xcite , braneworld models@xcite , holographic models@xcite , and so on , which are resorted to accounting for the present cosmic accelerating expansion .",
    "although the recent fits to the data in combination of wmap@xcite , the recently released 182 snia gold sample@xcite and also other cosmological observational data show remarkably the consistence of the cosmological constant , it is worth of noting that a class of dynamical models with the equation - of - state ( eos ) across @xmath5 _ quintom _ is mildly favored @xcite . in the literature there have been a lot of theoretical studies of quintom - like models .",
    "for example , motivated from string theory , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite realized a quintom scenario by considering the non - perturbative effects of a generalized dbi action .",
    "moreover , a no - go theorem has been proved to constrain the model building of quintom@xcite , and according to this no - go theorem there are models which involve higher derivative terms for a single scalar field @xcite , models with vector field @xcite , making use of an extended theory of gravity @xcite , non - local string field theory @xcite , and others ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the similar work applied in scalar - tensor theory is also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "previously , it has been considered that a quintom dark energy model and its combination with chaplygin gas fluid can be realized with non - regular spinor matter@xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that this type of model can realize many kinds of quintom scenario with transforming the form of potential of the spinor . to understand the possible combinations among different types of quintom model in spinor field , in this paper we study the implications of cosmic duality with this class of models .",
    "cosmic duality is a mathematic feature which origins from string cosmology@xcite and was later considered to link the standard cosmology and phantom cosmology together , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that there is a behavior of dual between the models of quintom - a and quintom - b . by studying the behavior of the energy density and pressure in spinor field we find a dual of the quintom - a and quintom - b .",
    "meanwhile , we realize additional quintom models by the aid of this property . since more and more dark energy models have been proposed to explain the current cosmic acceleration , a method to discriminate between the various contenders in a model independent manner",
    "was introduced by sahni in @xcite .",
    "the new cosmological diagnostic pair @xmath6 , called the statefinder , is a geometrical diagnostic which is algebraically related to the higher derivatives of the scale factor @xmath7 with respect to time and is a natural next step beyond the hubble parameter @xmath8 and the deceleration parameter @xmath9 which depends on @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", the dark energy can be distinguished more universally than the model - dependent physical variables depending on the properties of physical fields describing the dark energy .",
    "we plot the trajectories in the @xmath11 plane corresponding to these kind of quintom dark energy model .",
    "departure from the fixed point @xmath12 , for one given quintom model in spinor field , in correspondence with the spatially flat lcdm scenario provides a nice way of setting up the distance from lcdm .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section 2 , we investigate the implications of the cosmic duality in spinor quintom models of dark energy . in section 3 , we apply the statefinder diagnostic to the spinor quintom dark energy models .",
    "section 4 contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "to begin with the discussion , we consider a universe filled with quintom dark energy in spinor field@xcite , neglecting the contributions of the components of matter and radiation .",
    "and we deal with the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time , assuming the space - time metric as @xmath13 in the aid of the dynamics of a spinor field which is minimally coupled to einstein s gravity@xcite , we can write down the following dirac action in a curved space - time background @xmath14\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int d^4 x ~e~{\\cal l}_{\\psi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is the determinant of the vierbein @xmath16 and v stands for any scalar function of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and possibly additional matter fields .",
    "we will assume that v only depends on the scalar bilinear @xmath19 .",
    "for a gauge - transformed homogeneous and a space - independent spinor field , the equation of motion of spinor reads @xmath20 where a dot denotes a time derivative while a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath19 , and h is hubble parameter . to take a further derivative ,",
    "we can obtain the solution of equation of motion : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive time - independent constant and we define it as present value of @xmath19 .    in this section",
    "we study the duality of the quintom universe with spinor matter .",

    "furthermore , the duality of quintom model will be extended to the spinor quintom twice crossing @xmath5 .    in the framework of frw cosmology ,",

    "<S> performing in this paper the duality and statefinder diagnostic for a class of quintom models of dark energy which is constructed by the spinor field , we study the possible connections among different spinor quintom models and differentiate the quintom dark energy in spinor scenario from the others . </S>",
    "<S> a class of evolutionary trajectories of these quintom models in spinor field are plotted in the statefinder parameter planes . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the power - law - like potential also plays important role in this class of models from the statefinder viewpoint . </S>"
