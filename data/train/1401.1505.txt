    "understanding how stars form out of the ism is especially important since star formation determines the appearance and evolution of galaxies .",
    "in enriched systems ( with metallicity z@xmath2z@xmath3 ) , stars preferentially form in molecular gas ( e.g @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "milky way surveys using co emission lines as a tracer for molecular gas ( e.g @xcite , hereafter s87 ; @xcite ) , have shown that most of the galactic molecular gas is organized in large , discrete structures called giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "these clouds host virtually all star formation in the galaxy , but their formation , evolution and the processes that regulate the conversion of molecular gas into stars remain poorly understood ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "+ gmcs in the galaxy have typical sizes of @xmath4 pc , masses of @xmath5 @xmath6 , temperatures of @xmath7 k and and number densities of @xmath4 @xmath8 ( e.g. @xcite ) . as first described by @xcite , galactic gmcs show correlations between their size , line width and luminosity .",
    "s87 determined these empirical relations using a catalog of 273 inner milky way gmcs , establishing that gmcs are virialized objects with a velocity dispersion proportional to the square root of their radius , and a roughly constant surface density of @xmath9 m@xmath3 pc@xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "gmcs in the galaxy show a power - law mass spectrum with index @xmath11 , which indicates that most of the molecular gas is located in high mass clouds .",
    "+ high resolution surveys of the co emission in nearby galaxies provide the opportunity to address the universality of gmc properties and the relationship between gmcs and star formation across a wide range of environments . to date",
    ", several co surveys of local group galaxies have achieved sufficient resolution to identify individual gmcs ( e.g. @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , donovan - meyer et al .",
    "some studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have concluded that gmcs are insensitive to the physical conditions in their surroundings , while others have reported environment - dependent variations in gmc properties .",
    "several authors have observed that quiescent gmcs are typically less luminous than clouds that are actively forming stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , bolatto et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter b08 ) found that gmc populations in local group galaxies followed similar larson - type scaling relations as milky way gmcs , concluding that gmcs have similar physical properties ( as traced through their co emission ) throughout the local group . yet",
    "the universality of larson s laws has also been questioned : @xcite showed that milky way clouds with higher mass surface densities typically have a larger velocity dispersion at a fixed size scale . in the lmc",
    ", @xcite found no obvious relation between cloud size and velocity dispersion , while @xcite also obtained a poor size - linewidth correlation for gmcs in m33 .",
    "a comparative study of local group galaxies using a consistent methodology to identify and parametrize gmcs suggested that the gmc mass distribution is steeper in the low - mass galaxies than in the inner milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "the more recent surveys of co emission in the lmc and m33 by @xcite and @xcite  which identify a greater number of gmcs across a wider mass range than the datasets analyzed by @xcite  also find mass distributions steeper than in the milky way , with power - law slopes of @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the value of @xmath13 in the lmc depends on the decomposition method , while @xcite find that the gmc mass spectrum steepens with increasing galactocentric radius in m33 .",
    "+ to date , studies of extragalactic gmc populations have mostly probed low - mass galaxies where atomic gas dominates the neutral ism .",
    "this is because it is difficult to achieve the angular resolution required to identify individual gmcs in any galaxy outside the local group with current telescopes . as a result",
    ", there are almost no maps of the co emission in massive star - forming spiral galaxies where individual gmcs can be distinguished ( the recent carma - nobeyama nearby galaxies co(1 - 0 ) survey ( canon ) described by @xcite is a notable exception ) .",
    "this is a major lack , because massive star - forming spirals dominate the mass and light budget of blue galaxies and host most of the star formation in the present - day universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the formation and evolution of gmcs in such systems will help us to understand the physical processes that regulate the bulk of present - day massive star formation , something that studies of hi - dominated , low - mass local group galaxies with weak or absent spiral structure can not do .",

    "the inclusion of the 30 m single dish data during joint deconvolution ensures that flux information on all spatial scales is conserved .",
    "the rms of the noise fluctuations in the cube is @xmath22 k per 5 km s@xmath23 channel .",
    "this sensitivity is sufficient to detect an object with a gas mass of @xmath24 at the @xmath25 level .",
    "the paws data cube covers the lsr velocity range between 173 to 769 km s@xmath23 . a detailed description of the observing strategy , calibration and data reduction is presented by @xcite .",
    "we used the cprops package ( @xcite ; herafter rl06 ) to identify gmcs and measure their physical properties .",
    "cprops has been fully described in rl06 . in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief summary of cprops in order to explain the construction of the paws gmc catalog .",
    "+ cprops begins by identifying a `` working area '' , i.e. regions of significant emission within the data cube .",
    "this is done by masking pixels in two consecutive velocity channels in which the signal is above @xmath26 ( the ` threshold ` parameter in cprops ) .",
    "these regions are then extended to include all adjacent pixels in which the signal is above @xmath27 ( the ` edge ` parameter in cprops ) in at least two consecutive channels .",
    "the rms noise @xmath28 is estimated from the median absolute deviation ( mad ) of each spectrum . to be consistent with previous gmc studies ( e.g. b08 ) we adopted @xmath29 and @xmath30 . after defining the working area , cprops proceeds to generate a catalog of _ islands _ , emission structures within the working area with a projected area of at least one telescope beam and spanning one or more velocity channels .",
    "this kind of approach can be sufficient to catalog discrete molecular structures in irregular and flocculent galaxies , where the emission is typically sparsely distributed within the observed field ( e.g. the lmc , @xcite ) .",
    "for the paws data cube , by contrast , bright co emission is present throughout the inner spiral arms and across the central region , and is hence identified as a single island .",
    "we present a catalog of islands within the paws fov in appendix  [ app : island ] .",
    "+ to identify structures that resemble galactic gmcs , we used a `` data - based '' decomposition to further segment the islands .",
    "these objects are defined using a modified watershed algorithm : local maxima ( called `` kernels '' in cprops ) within a box of 120 pc @xmath31 120 pc and 15 kms@xmath23 are recognized as independent objects if they lie at least @xmath32 above the shared contour ( called the `` merge level '' in cprops ) with any other maximum . by default , cprops requires that the moments associated with other maxima differ by 100% , otherwise the two maxima are merged into a single cloud .",
    "we found that this condition does not work well for the paws data , causing cprops to reject a large number of objects that visual inspection would suggest are gmcs . in brief , this is because cprops attempts to compare all the local maxima within the bright region of contiguous emission that encompasses the spiral arms , even when the local maxima are spatially well - separated .",
    "we disable this step of the decomposition algorithm by setting the parameter ` sigdiscont`=0 .",
    "we explain our tests of the cprops decomposition algorithm in more detail in appendix  [ app : test_sd ] .",
    "+      cprops uses an extrapolated moment method to measure the physical properties of the clouds that it identifies . to reduce observational bias , cprops extrapolates the cloud property measurements to values that would be expected in the case of perfect sensitivity by performing a growth - type analysis on the observed emission .",
    "cprops also corrects for finite resolution in the spatial and spectral domain by deconvolving the telescope beam and the width of a spectral channel from the measured cloud size and line width .",
    "cprops estimates the uncertainty in measured cloud properties via bootstrapping of the assigned pixels .",
    "we tested that 50 bootstrapping measurements provide a reliable estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "this bootstrapping approach captures the dominant uncertainty for bright clouds , but neglects the statistical uncertainty due to noise fluctuations that can be significant for low @xmath33 data . to check that the bootstrapping uncertainties provide a reliable estimate of the uncertainty in our cloud properties",
    ", we generated 100 synthetic datacubes each containing a barely resolved , round model cloud , to which we added different realizations of noise at the beam scale .",
    "we ran cprops on these cubes , and compared the standard deviation of the cloud property measurements to the uncertainties estimated by the bootstrapping procedure .",
    "we found that the bootstrapping uncertainties were approximately equal to the standard deviation of the cloud property measurements for clouds with low @xmath33 ratios ( @xmath34 $ ] ) , while for brighter clouds ( @xmath35 $ ] ) , the bootstrapping uncertainties were larger than the standard deviation of the cloud property measurements by a factor of @xmath36 or more . in",
    "what follows , we refer to all objects whose properties have been calculated by these procedures as gmcs , and we quote the bootstrapping uncertainties only .",
    "we distinguish them from the entities that are initially identified by cprops ( i.e. prior to the application of sensitivity and resolution corrections ) , which we call `` identified objects '' . in the rest of this section ,",
    "we summarize the cloud property definitions that are used by cprops .",
    "+      _ peak brightness temperature_. the peak brightness temperature of a gmc is the co brightness at the local maximum within the cloud .",

    "+ _ effective radius_. cprops calculates the major and minor axes of the identified objects using a moment method that takes into account the intensity profile of the emission . in this technique ,",
    "the cloud root - mean - square ( rms ) size , @xmath37 , is calculated as the geometric mean of the second spatial moment of the intensity distribution along the major ( @xmath38(0 k ) ) and minor ( @xmath39(0 k ) ) axes extrapolated for perfect sensitivity : @xmath40 assuming that the cloud is a sphere , its _ effective radius _ , @xmath41 , is related to @xmath37 through the sphere s density profile , @xmath42 .",
    "cprops uses a truncated density profile with @xmath43 , in which case the object s effective radius is @xmath44 .",
    "the effective radius is then deconvolved by the beam size @xmath45 : @xmath46    if one or both axes of the cloud are smaller than the beam ( @xmath47 ) , then the deconvolution correction results in an undefined radius .",
    "the cloud is not rejected by cprops since it consists of more pixels than a cylinder with dimensions of one beam area @xmath31 one channel width .",
    "for these objects we define an upper limit to the effective radius : @xmath48 approximately @xmath49 of the gmcs in the paws catalog have only an upper limit to their radius .",

    "however , we note that if the initially identified object spans less than two channels , then it is automatically discarded from the catalog .",
    "+ _ axis ratio_. the ratio between the major and minor axis is obtained directly from the spatial moments @xmath39(0 k ) and @xmath38(0 k ) without conversion into their physical quantities . the axis ratio , @xmath55 , parametrizes the shape of the cloud : for a round cloud @xmath56 , while @xmath57 corresponds to an elongated cloud . + _ position angle and orientation_. the position angle @xmath58 of each cloud s major axis is measured clockwise , i.e. from north through west , with north set to @xmath59 . in a spiral galaxy , it is often more instructive to study the position angle of the clouds with respect to the spiral arm frame .",
    "thus we define the cloud orientation @xmath60 as the angle between the cloud major axis and a double logarithmic spiral with a pitch angle @xmath61 .",
    "this pitch angle is conventionally adopted to define m51 s spiral arms ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a gmc population with major axes perfectly aligned with the spiral arms would yield a delta function distribution of @xmath60 values , centered at @xmath62 .      _ cloud mass_. cprops estimates the cloud mass in two ways : from the co luminosity and from the virial theorem .",

    "this reinforces our conclusion that gmcs in the spiral arm and the central regions tend to have a higher velocity dispersions than inter - arm gmcs , since the former have higher @xmath33 ratios and hence more accurate velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "nevertheless this does not influence the conclusions on the unboundness of the clouds , since the objects with an intrinsically low velocity dispersion represent only the 5% of the 394 clouds with @xmath271 .",
    "+ the difference between the gmc flux after extrapolation and the flux measured directly within the identified objects is high ( table  [ gmcs_flux ] ) .",
    "indeed the average corrected co luminosity of the gmc is 2.5@xmath31 greater than the unextrapolated value ( table  [ tab : corr_table ] ) .",
    "although this is consistent with the results obtained on ic10 in rl06 , it represents a significant addition to the flux of our identified gmcs and therefore merits further examination .",
    "+ while the original cprops paper ( rl06 ) provides guidelines for checking whether extrapolated measurements of the cloud radius and velocity dispersion can be considered reliable , this is not the case for extrapolated measurements of the co luminosity .",
    "nevertheless we can draw some conclusions based on a comparison between the extrapolated and the observed flux within gmcs ( see section  [ sec : props_general ] ) and the extended component discussed in @xcite . although gmcs are often considered to account for nearly all the co emission in normal galactic disks ( @xmath323 , @xcite ) , roughly half of the co flux in m51 arises from a diffuse thick disk of molecular gas ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of its properties ) .",
    "the fact that gmcs ( after extrapolation ) contribute 54% of the total co flux in the paws fov would seem compatible with the existence of a diffuse , extended component that is responsible for a comparable fraction of the total co luminosity . if , instead , the co luminosities of gmcs were closer to their unextrapolated values , @xmath270% of the co emission within the paw fov must be attributed to an ill - defined `` watershed '' .",
    "much of this undecomposed `` watershed '' emission reaches temperatures above 4 k , characteristic of compact structures in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "while this flux could be associated with entities smaller than the beam , it is also possible that the watershed is actually part of the gmcs .",
    "presumably , this part of the emission could not be properly attributed to clouds by the identification algorithm , given the low contrast between cloud and intra - cloud emission .",
    "we might therefore assume the initially identified objects as `` bright cores '' of more extended structures that we recover only through the extrapolation correction .",
    "overall , our examination of the effects of the sensitivity and resolution corrections on the measured cloud properties highlights the limitations of the cprops method in decomposing physically reliable objects in highly crowded and low contrast environments .",
    "although other methods , like the `` patchwork '' separation performed by clumpfind , are able to attribute all the measured flux to discrete objects , the resulting separation is ambiguous when gmcs do not have well - defined boundaries , as in the case of the cloud population in m51 .",
    "having reviewed the physical properties of gmcs in different regions of m51 , we now examine whether the clouds obey the scaling relations commonly referred to as `` larson s laws '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first larson s law , or _ size - velocity dispersion relation _ , states that @xmath324 ( s87 ) ; it is considered to be a manifestation of turbulence inside the cloud or of virial equilibrium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second larson s law asserts that gmcs are roughly self - gravitating .",
    "the third law describes an inverse correlation between the size of a cloud and its density , implying that all gmcs have approximately constant surface density . + to estimate the degree of correlation between gmc properties we calculate the spearman s rank correlation coefficient ( @xcite ) .",
