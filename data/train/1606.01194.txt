    "the most famous skyrmion - carrying materials system are the helimagnets with the crystalline space group @xmath6 , such as mnsi , fege , and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic phases and formation of the skyrmion lattice phase is well - described by the ginzburg - landau equation that takes into account thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the size of a skyrmion is usually 20 - 70  nm for these materials , which to a large degree limits the available techniques that can fully characterize their magnetic structure .",

    "spontaneous symmetry breaking and domain formation are the natural consequences of magnetism , suggesting that a similar domain effect may exist in the skyrmion lattice phase .",
    "however , this requires a characterization technique that probes the material on a mesoscopic scale , in - between the local probing of ltem and the macroscopic averaging of neutron diffraction . here , we present resonant soft x - ray scattering on single crystal cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , which covers the length scale needed to observe skyrmion domains , revisiting earlier work by langner",

    "such a reduced moment is commonly found in metal oxides .",
    "the field dependence measurements at 5  k give a saturation value of 0.5  @xmath10/cu , i.e. , half the value expected for a @xmath12 spin system , indicative of a collinear ferrimagnetic alignment .",
    "the anti - aligned spins are situated on the two chemically distinct copper sites in a ratio of 3:1 .",
    "the cu sites have a strong dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which is at the origin of the ferroelectricity of this material @xcite .",
    "cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 has an energy hierarchy similar to other metallic helimagnets @xcite . for the skyrmion phase ,",
    "the helix propagation orientation is weakly pinned by the cubic anisotropy , and can be easily unpinned by introducing fluctuations , such as an electrical field @xcite or a thermal gradient @xcite .",
    "density - functional - theory calculations show that the propagation wave vectors along all orientations are degenerate for the skyrmion phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that under weak perturbation condition , multiple skyrmion domains can exist .",
    "the domains have identical absolute values of the propagation vectors , but differ in orientation .",
    "this has been observed in both mnsi and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 systems by real - time ltem , and in fe@xmath13co@xmath14si by sans @xcite .",
    "one can observe the rotating skyrmion domains , confirmed by the two sets of six - fold symmetric spots of the fourier transform images @xcite .",
    "in a recent study , langner _",
    "_  @xcite reported resonant soft x - ray scattering ( rexs ) of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 . in their experiment the wavelength of the polarized x - rays was tuned to the cu @xmath2 edge , and the magnetic diffraction spots were captured on the ccd camera plane in the ( 001 ) bragg condition . in the camera image , the shape of the magnetic satellites is field- and photon energy - dependent , and develops a fine structure , ultimately splitting into more than one spot .",
    "the authors interpret this spot splitting as arising from the moir pattern of two superposed skyrmion sublattices , which originate from two inequivalent cu sites , as evidenced by a 2  ev split in their x - ray absorption spectra .",
    "we performed resonant soft x - ray diffraction experiments on a well - characterized cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 single crystal @xcite and obtained a reciprocal space maps in the @xmath15-plane of the skyrmion phase . in the following we give a detailed description of these measurements and",
    "present a critical discussion of langner _",
    "et al . _ s results together with an alternative explanation for the peak splitting of the magnetic diffraction peaks observed in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 based on the formation of a multidomain state",
    "for resonant scattering at the @xmath16 edge of @xmath17 transition metals it is sufficient to take only electric - dipole transitions into account @xcite .",
    "further , there are two main characteristics of @xmath17 materials worth noting .",
    "first , the photon energy falls into the range of 0.4 - 1  kev , leading to relatively long wavelengths , which limits the number of accessible materials for experiments in reflection geometry . at the cu @xmath2 edge ,",
    "the x - ray wavelength @xmath18 is @xmath19   . for b20 helimagnetic metals , such as mnsi , fe@xmath14co@xmath13si , or fege , the ( structural ) lattice constant @xmath20 is around 4.5 - 4.7    @xcite .",
    "since @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bragg angle , no structural bragg reflection is accessible .",
    "cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , on the other hand , has a relatively large lattice constant ( @xmath20 = 8.925   ) @xcite so that the ( forbidden ) ( 001 ) peak is accessible .",
    "this provides an ideal condition for performing resonant elastic x - ray scattering ( rexs ) in reflection geometry .",
    "second , the penetration depth of soft x - rays varies strongly for photon energies across the absorption edge @xcite .",
    "the scattering is more bulk - sensitive for photon energies below the @xmath2 and further above the @xmath23 edges , whereas it is more surface - sensitive at resonance . in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1",
    "the x - ray attenuation length at normal incidence at the @xmath2 edge maximum is 95  nm , while below the absorption edge the attenuation length is 394  nm @xcite .    in a rexs experiment",
    ", magnetic diffraction occurs around a structural bragg peak , as the local magnetic moments are connected to the magnetic atoms that give rise to the resonant diffraction .",
    "therefore , for scattering from single - crystalline cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , the positions of the magnetic satellites around ( 001 ) yield the information about the orientation and periodicity of the modulation .",
    "the diffraction intensity reveals information about the detailed magnetization configuration @xmath24 .",
    "this is the basic principle for characterizing magnetic structures and for distinguishing between different magnetic phases .",
    "note that for space group @xmath6 the ( 001 ) peak is crystallographically forbidden and absent in off - resonant scattering , however , the anisotropic third - rank tensor stemming from the mixed dipole - quadrupole term allows for the extinction peak to appear for non - centrosymmetric crystals at the x - ray resonance condition @xcite .",
    "cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 is a chiral magnet , suggesting ordered spin helices , which further host , in a pocket of the @xmath25-@xmath26 ( temperature vs magnetic - field ) phase space , ` crystalline ' magnetic order in the form of the skyrmion lattice .",
    "the magnetic modulation is incommensurate , which means that it is decoupled from the atomic lattice .",
    "moreover , the modulation has a long periodicity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the continuum approximation can be applied to model the magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "the system s ground state ( @xmath27 ) is the one - dimensional , helically ordered state composed of single - harmonic modes , where @xmath28 is the wave vector of the helix with @xmath29 being the real - space helical pitch . the orientation of the modulation is pinned along a @xmath30 direction by the cubic anisotropy @xcite . the magnetization configuration for one helical pitch",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) , in which the modulation is along @xmath31 .",
    "this is the elemental unit of the helical periodic structure , i.e. , the motif of the magnetic crystal .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the helical pitch @xmath32 is equal to the helix - to - helix distance @xmath33 for cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , as well as other b20 metallic helimagnets .",
    "this is well - established by both sans @xcite and ltem @xcite studies .",
    "the magnetic elemental units are shown for ( a ) helical and ( b ) conical phase .",
    "the magnetic elemental unit for the skyrmion phase is indicated in ( c ) along with the basis vectors of the magnetic unit cell .",
    "the elemental units give rise to the form factors for resonant diffraction and the magnetic unit cells to the structure factors of resonant scattering , as well as the magnetic reciprocal space maps.,width=325 ]    above a certain magnetic field @xmath34 , the conical spiral state becomes the lowest energy solution .",
    "the single - harmonic spiral has the same pitch as the helical state .",
    "the spiral rotates in the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane .",
    "the magnetization component along @xmath37-direction is proportional to the magnetic field . at a certain field , @xmath38 ,",
    "all the magnetization vectors are parallel , forming the ferrimagnetic state .",
    "the conical periodic order can also be described by a unit cell that consists of two conical spirals .",
    "the skyrmion vortex structure is a metastable solution in the phenomenological model , unless thermal fluctuation are being taken into account @xcite . a single skyrmion vortex , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) , can be written in the form of an axially symmetric magnetization distribution @xcite , @xmath39\\cos [ \\kappa(\\phi+\\phi_0 ) ] \\,\\,\\,,\\\\",
    "m_2^\\mathrm{sky } ( \\rho,\\phi ) & = m_s \\sin [ \\theta(\\rho)]\\sin[\\kappa(\\phi+\\phi_0 ) ] \\,\\,\\,,\\\\",

    "thus , the form factor for an individual skyrmion can be written in the form of @xmath44    the integral is taken over the circular area of a skyrmion vortex .",
    "in contrast to the helical and conical states , the skyrmion state is a two - dimensional solution .",
    "the ` crystal ' structure is essentially a hexagonal - type two - dimensional lattice .",
    "therefore , the two - dimensional unit cell can be chosen as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) .",
    "the structure factor then becomes @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the real - space basis vectors , which are rotated by @xmath49 with respect to each other .",
    "the core - to - core distance is @xmath50 , which can be regarded as the ` lattice constant ' of the skyrmion crystal .",
    ", lying on perpendicular axes .",
    "( b ) magnetic satellites in reciprocal space for the skyrmion state , where the spots are in the @xmath15 plane ( @xmath51 is perpendicular to the plane of the paper).,width=325 ]    using the form factors of the helical ( @xmath52 ) , conical ( @xmath53 ) , and skyrmion ( @xmath54 ) motifs , as well as their structure factors @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 of the unit cells , one can easily obtain the reciprocal space maps . in the helical state , the ` lattice constant ' is equal to the helical pitch . therefore , the first - order diffraction peaks appear at @xmath58 , and the reciprocal lattice is purely one - dimensional . in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , the direction of @xmath28 is not entirely degenerate , but additionally governed by the sixth order magnetic anisotropy , giving rise to the three - fold degenerate preferred orientation along the three equivalent @xmath59 directions .",
    "consequently , three spatially separated helical domains are expected .",
    "moreover , the helical magnetic reciprocal space lattice has to be imposed on the crystalline reciprocal space lattice in order to obtain the diffraction condition .",
    "the reciprocal space of the helical crystal is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_2](a ) , and summarized in table [ tab_1 ] . in the conical state , the reciprocal space is similar to the one of the helical phase in that the first order diffraction peaks ( modulation vector ) appear at @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the direction of @xmath58 is entirely governed by the magnetic field direction , and in fact parallel to it .",
    "therefore , there is only a ` single domain ' state observed , as summarized in table [ tab_1 ] . in the skyrmion state , the reciprocal space [ cf . , fig .",
    "[ fig_2](b ) ] has three reciprocal - space basis vectors @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "they are separated by @xmath49 and are related to the three lattice constants by @xmath63 .",

    "the incident x - rays are linearly polarized with a photon energy of 931.25  ev .",
    "six sharp satellite peaks can be observed , corresponding to the skyrmion phase .",
    "moreover , when scanning both temperature and field across the skyrmion phase region , no peak splitting is observed .",

    "now , the well - defined six spots split into two , and finally three sets .",
    "this confirms the existence of a multidomain skyrmion state , where each domain has a different helix propagation orientation , which can be intentionally created by introducing a magnetic field gradient .",
    "this observation of a multidomain state is consistent with earlier ltem work by tokura _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where split peaks ( in the fourier transforms of the ltem domain patterns ) were observed as part of a dynamic domain rotation process ( see supplementary movie s2 in ref .",
    "it has to be noted that x - ray based techniques are sampling a much larger area than electron microscopy based techniques , meaning that a multidomain state observable by ltem will be picked up by rexs as well .",
    "resonant soft x - ray diffraction experiments on cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 single crystals has been previously carried out by langner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the observation of two sets of six - fold symmetric spots has been reported .",
    "the authors state that the peak splitting arises from the two inequivalent cu sites .",
    "they support this statement by an observed 2-ev difference in energy profiles for the so - called ` left ' and ` right ' spot spectra ( shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "they further argue that the two - fold splitting is linked to an in - plane rotation of two skyrmion sublattices , leading to a moir pattern ( fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "bond valence sum calculations show that the two inequivalent cu@xmath68 and cu@xmath69 sites in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 ( where the superscripts i and ii refer to the different lattice sites , not to different oxidation states ) have practically the same valence charge @xcite , and density functional theory calculations show that their unoccupied states have very similar energies @xcite .",
    "we note that the cu @xmath16 transition for cu@xmath11 is @xmath70@xmath71 . in the final state",
    "the @xmath17 shell is full , which reduces the transition to a one - electron process without @xmath72-@xmath17 core - hole interaction .",
    "this gives a single absorption peak at 931  ev without multiplet splitting @xcite .",
    "there are no known cu @xmath73 compounds with such a large splitting energy , and in fact , the energy splitting that could be expected would be well below @xmath91  ev . as reported by bos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and earlier by other others , cu@xmath74 and cu@xmath75 have practically the same valence charge , which can only result in a minute energy shift in the cu @xmath2 absorption spectrum , well below the energy resolution limit ( and certainly less than 2  ev reported in ref .",
    "note that the case would be of course very different for systems in which multiplet splitting exists , such as fe compounds @xcite . since cuo@xmath0 exhibits a peak at 933  ev @xcite ,",
    "one possible explanation is that the higher energy peak is due to a cu@xmath76 contamination .",
    "alternatively , another possible source of the discrepancy is the way the energy scans are carried out .",
    "in particular , spectroscopic data obtained by analyzing the local pixels at the ccd plane is rather inaccurate , as the definition of the ` left ' and ` right ' spots on the camera is arbitrary for each energy .",
    "most importantly , for different photon energies , scattering from the same propagation wave vector will result in a shift of the spot in the camera plane , leading to a ` rocking - curve - like ' gaussian peak .",
    "therefore , from a spectroscopic viewpoint , there is no evidence that the split - satellite peak is due to inequivalent cu sites .    a core argument for the formation of double - split six - fold diffraction patterns , given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .  4 ) , is that the superposition of two in - plane rotated skyrmion sublattices leads to a moir pattern .",
    "however , the real - space moir pattern and the presented fourier transform ( diffraction pattern ) are mathematically not related .",
    "rather , the superposition leads to new components in the fourier spectrum , in particular six - fold symmetric satellites around the main reciprocal lattice points that result from the long wavelength beating in the moir pattern  a phenomenon well - known from hexagonal coincidence lattices @xcite .",
    "further , it is important to consider another requirement that has to be met in order to carry out rexs experiments in a quantitative way . in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the skyrmion plane is always perpendicular to the vertical direction of the laboratory reference frame , given by the fixed direction of the magnetic field , and it is thus independent of the goniometer angle @xmath22 .",
    "there are ( at least ) six wave vectors ( @xmath77 ) coupled to the ( 001 ) bragg peak , giving rise to the observed magnetic peaks . in fig .",
    "2(a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , these magnetic peaks are different in both amplitude and orientation . therefore , for a single @xmath22 , it is impossible to reach the diffraction conditions for all six magnetic peaks at the same time . the observed skyrmion pattern ( ccd images in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(a ) in @xcite ) was collected in the _ structural _ ( 001 ) bragg condition , which is not the correct diffraction condition for either of the magnetic satellites . as a result of this ,",
    "the satellites still have intensity , analogously to sitting at the edge of a rocking - curve peak .",
    "a single - shot ccd image corresponds to a curved plane in reciprocal space , which is not equal to the skyrmion plane in reciprocal space . as a result of this",
    ", the skyrmion diffraction spots will not end up on a circle , but on an oval , as can be seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) in ref .",
    "these satellite spot on the camera does not correspond to the peak position of ( 001)+@xmath77 , but a poorly - defined reciprocal space point that could largely deviate from ( 001)+@xmath77 . also , the magnetic peaks of ( 001)+@xmath77 will not necessarily appear on the same oval for a single goniometer angle as they do not reach the diffraction conditions at this angle .    instead , a much more simple explanation of a peak splitting in this context is the occurrence of two _ non - superimposed _ skyrmion lattice domains that are simultaneously sampled by the wide x - ray beam .",
    "in conclusion , we used rexs on the chiral magnet cu@xmath78oseo@xmath79 .",
    "we presented a detailed discussion of the magnetic contrast stemming from the magnetic phases .",
    "we showed experimental results of the six - fold symmetric magnetic diffraction pattern , in which the peaks were unsplit , double - split , as well as triple - split , depending on the magnetic history of the sample .",
