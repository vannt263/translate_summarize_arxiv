    "extreme black holes lie in the boundary between black holes and naked singularities .",
    "since black holes are believed to be astrophysically relevant , whereas naked singularities are considered unphysical , the issue of stability of extreme black holes is key in understanding the process of gravitational collapse .",
    "black hole stability is a longstanding open problem in general relativity .",
    "the pioneering works of regge , wheeler @xcite , zerilli @xcite @xcite and moncrief @xcite determined the modal linear stability of electro - gravitational perturbations in the domain of outer communication of the spherically symmetric electro - vacuum black holes , by ruling out exponential growth in time .",
    "since then , a lot of effort has been made to establish more accurate bounds on linear fields .",
    "in particular , analyzing the scalar wave equation on the black hole background provides useful insight into the more complex problem of linear gravitational perturbations .",
    "kay and wald ( @xcite @xcite @xcite ) obtained uniform boundedness for solutions of the wave equation on the exterior of the schwarzschild black hole . in recent years",
    "this result has been extended to the non - extreme kerr black hole ( see the review articles @xcite , @xcite and references therein . ) the purpose of this work is to place pointwise bounds on scalar waves on the exterior region of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "the interest in reissner - nordstrm black holes lies in the fact that they share the complexity of the global structure of the more relevant kerr black holes and , due to spherical symmetry , are far more tractable than the rotating holes .",
    "the modal stability of the outer region of reissner - nordstrm black holes under linear perturbations of the metric and electromagnetic fields was established in @xcite @xcite @xcite , both for the extreme and sub - extreme cases .",
    "the modal _ instability _ of the reissner - nordstrm naked singularity , and also of the black hole inner static region , was proved only recently in @xcite .",
    "the wave equation on extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes has recently been studied by aretakis in a series of relevant articles @xcite , where it was found that second and higher order transverse derivatives at the horizon grow without bound along the horizon generators ( see also @xcite were similar results were found for the teukolsky equation on an extreme kerr black hole ) .",
    "one of the motivations of our article is understanding the meaning of these instabilities .",
    "more specifically , we wonder if they arise in the evolution of fields from data of compact support on a @xmath2 constant cauchy surface (  compact data \" , for short ) , which is a subclass in @xcite for which , as we show below , the proof of instability there fails .",
    "although we do not prove that the horizon instability is absent for compact data , we do show that , if present , is milder .",
    "on the other side , we get a remarkably simple proof of pointwise boundedness of fields of compact data and their partial derivatives of any order in @xmath0 coordinates on the open black hole exterior region .",
    "these results are stated under theorem [ t:1 ] in section [ sec : main - result ] , where their relevance to the problem of spherical gravitational collapse is discussed .",
    "theorem [ t:1 ] is proved in section [ sec : behav - massl - scal ] .",
    "consider the exterior region @xmath3 of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this region is described in isotropic coordinates @xmath4 by the metric @xmath5 where the positive constant @xmath6 represents the total mass of the spacetime , which equals the absolute value of the total electric charge . the electromagnetic field @xmath7 together with this metric , solves the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "note that the isotropic coordinate @xmath8 differs from the standard radial coordinate @xmath9 that gives the area @xmath10 of the spheres spanned by acting on a point with the @xmath11 isometry subgroup . instead of @xmath8 , it is often more convenient to use the  tortoise   radial variable @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 we choose the integration constant such that @xmath14 isotropic coordinates cover only the open exterior region @xmath3 of the black hole .",
    "figure [ f:1 ] exhibits the well known conformal diagram of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , region @xmath3 appears shaded .",
    "the unshaded region is the black hole interior , proved to be linearly unstable in @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is a generic @xmath2 constant surface , it is a cauchy surface for @xmath3 and a complete riemannian manifold with topology @xmath16 .",
    "its induced metric approaches that of the cylinder as @xmath17 , limit in which the area of the isometry spheres tend to @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 the future and past timelike infinity of @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the asymptotically flat spacelike infinity is denoted by @xmath21 , and the asymptotically cylindrical end of @xmath2 constant surfaces is denoted @xmath22 .",
    "note that the surface @xmath15 , being orthogonal to the killing vector @xmath23 , is asymptotically null at @xmath22 .",
    "+        in this work we study the scalar wave equation on @xmath3 @xmath24 with initial data on @xmath15 @xmath25 where the dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath26 . the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the cauchy problem ( [ laplacian])-([id ] ) on a curved background",
    "is well established ( see , for example , @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "we prove the following    [ t:1 ] let @xmath27 be a solution of the wave equation ( [ laplacian ] ) on the open exterior region @xmath3 of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole , which has smooth initial data ( [ i d ] ) of compact support on the cauchy surface @xmath15 .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath28 , which depends only on the initial data ( [ i d ] ) , such that , in @xmath3 , @xmath29 all higher partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates @xmath30 are similarly bounded in @xmath3 .",
    "namely , for any @xmath31 there exists a constant @xmath32 that depends on the initial data , such that @xmath33    theorem [ t:1 ] establishes that the spacetime @xmath3 is stable with respect to this class of initial data .",
    "a key simplification in the study of extreme black holes , compared to non - extreme ones , is the existence of complete exterior cauchy surfaces such as @xmath15 .",
    "this has been extensively used in the present work because it allows us to avoid the delicate issues related to the behaviour of fields near the horizon .",
    "we should stress that theorem [ t:1 ] applies to the evolution of data with compact support on @xmath15 . by finite speed propagation , it is clear that the restriction of @xmath27 to any @xmath2 constant slice will have compact support , and , by smoothness , it will be bounded .",
    "the non - trivial statement in theorem [ t:1 ] is that there exists a @xmath26-independent bound for @xmath27 .",
    "the scalar wave equation on the exterior of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole has recently been treated by aretakis in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite by evolving data from a non - cauchy surface such as @xmath34 in figure [ f:1 ] .",
    "this surface intersects the horizon on one end , goes to spacelike infinity on the other end , and is suitable to analyze the stability of the exterior region of a spherical collapse of an extreme charged body ( see figure [ f:2 ] ) . among the many estimates found in these articles , two of them relate closely to our result .",
    "the first one is the pointwise boundedness of the solution in the domain of dependence of @xmath34 , in terms of initial data on @xmath34 , given in theorem 4 in @xcite .",
    "a weaker bound than ( [ boundphi ] ) , @xmath35 , follows from this theorem and the fact that , for the kind of initial data we consider , @xmath27 has compact support @xmath36 in the region between @xmath15 and @xmath34 .",
    "there are , however , two important motivations to study compact data fields .",
    "the first one is that the proof of theorem [ t:1 ] is considerably simpler than the boundedness proof in @xcite , since it uses uses only arguments involving the canonical conserved energy of the wave equation , this being possible due to the existence of the above mentioned complete cauchy surface .",
    "the cost of this simplification is that the results in @xcite apply to a wider class of data on @xmath34 than those coming from the evolution of fields with compact support on @xmath15 , as we discuss below .",
    "the second motivation is determining if the blow up result for second and higher transverse derivatives at the horizon along the horizon generators , reported in theorem 6 in @xcite , and generalized to scalar wave equations on spacetimes with degenerate killing horizons in @xcite , holds for compact data .",
    "to state this result we need to switch to a coordinate system that covers the horizon : @xmath37 in these coordinates the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) has the form @xmath38 and the entire diagram in figure [ f:1 ] is covered .",
    "the horizon is located at @xmath39 , and region @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "the killing vector field @xmath42 becomes null at @xmath39 , its integral lines are the horizon generators , and @xmath43 is an affine parameter .",
    "note that @xmath44 is a null vector , orthogonal to the @xmath11 orbits , and has unit inner product with @xmath42 .",
    "we call @xmath45 a _ transverse derivative at the horizon .",
    "_ theorem 6 in @xcite states that second and higher order transverse derivatives of a solution of the scalar field equation diverge as @xmath46 along horizon generators .",
    "although this result holds for generic data in the class analyzed therein , it fails for those fields which evolve from data with compact support on @xmath15 , as we discuss in detail in section [ sec : transv - deriv - at ] . for fields evolving from compact data , we could not rule out these divergences , although we showed that , if present , they would be milder than those reported by aretakis .    in what follows",
    "we analyze the behaviour of fields with initial data with compact support on @xmath15 of figure [ f:1 ] .",
    "consider the spherically symmetric collapse of charged matter .",
    "it is possible to arrange the matter model in such a way that the exterior region is a portion of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "one way of constructing such spacetime is by using a thin shell of matter , this has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "other models are those of charged dust collapse ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the present discussion it is enough to know that such a construction is feasible with some matter model .",
    "we show schematically the conformal diagram of a charged collapse spacetime in figure [ f:2 ] , where we have avoided drawing the singularity , which may have a complicated structure , irrelevant to our purposes .        in a realistic collapse of matter",
    "there is always a surface like @xmath34 , for which the intersection @xmath47 of its future domain of dependence with the domain of outer communications agrees with that of @xmath34 in figure [ f:1 ] .",
    "note that the results in @xcite apply to @xmath47 for data given on @xmath34 which may be non trivial at the horizon . in figure [ f:2 ]",
    ", @xmath15 is a cauchy surface of @xmath48 topology that enters the matter region , and @xmath49 is the minimal subset of @xmath15 whose future contains @xmath34 .",
    "the results @xcite imply that generic data of compact support within the vacuum region of @xmath15 will evolve in a bounded wave in the vacuum portion of this spacetime outside the horizon .",
    "this is so because the portion of this region lying between @xmath15 and @xmath34 is compact and , as the data of this field on @xmath34 is in the aretakis class , the field is also bounded in the outer region in the future of @xmath34 .",
    "+ our proof of boundedness is simpler , but can only be applied to the spherical collapse model if we restrict to those fields with data of compact support in @xmath49 ( instead of @xmath15 ) , for which the evolution in the outer region is identical to that of a field in the reissner - nordstrm geometry . physically , these fields are characterized by the fact that they reach the horizon after the surface of the collapsing star has crossed it .",
    "we prove below that the growth of these fields along horizon generators is milder than the growth of those fields which enter the matter region earlier .",
    "the fact that fields initially supported in @xmath50 are better behaved than those entering the matter before the horizon is formed is an aspect of the stability of the spherical collapse worth pointing out .",
    "consider the wave equation ( [ laplacian ] ) on the exterior @xmath51 of the extreme reissner - nordstrm background , whose metric in isotropic coordinates is ( [ metric1 ] ) .",
    "defining @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 where a dot means @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath1 is the tortoise radial coordinate introduced in ( [ s ] ) , and @xmath56 is the standard laplacian on the unit sphere . from ( [ s ] )",
    "we deduce @xmath57 the potentials @xmath58 and @xmath59 are positive , bounded @xmath60 and have the following fall off @xmath61 the symmetry in the asymptotic expressions above is not coincidental , @xmath62 is an even function of @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this symmetry is the conformal isometry @xmath28 of extreme reissner - nordstrm noticed in @xcite , given by @xmath63 under this map the pullback of the metric and electromagnetic fields are @xmath64    since the equation @xmath65 is conformally invariant with conformal weight minus one , and the ricci scalar of an electro - vacuum solution vanishes ( thus @xmath66 ) , it follows that , if @xmath67 is a solution of @xmath68 , then so is @xmath69 for the above field @xmath70 .",
    "the conformal isometry is easily expressed in the alternative radial coordinate @xmath1 : under @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that for any solution @xmath73 of @xmath74 , the function @xmath75 is also a solution of this equation , implies that @xmath76 .",
    "+ note the consistency of the bound ( [ boundphi ] ) with the conformal symmetry : if @xmath27 has compact support on a @xmath77slice , then so does @xmath78 given in ( [ fip ] ) , however the bound on @xmath78 gives no additional information , as it follows from the bound on @xmath27 : @xmath79    finally , although we will not make use of this fact , we note that the operator @xmath80 is the laplacian on the cylinder @xmath81 with respect to the metric @xmath82 which reduces to the standard metric on @xmath83 if we set @xmath84 .",

    "higher @xmath242derivatives can be bounded in this way by induction : take @xmath243 @xmath242derivatives of equation ( [ sder ] ) , this gives @xmath244 in terms of lower @xmath242derivatives of @xmath245 and @xmath231 , all of which , being solutions of ( [ eqf ] ) with compact support on @xmath77slices , are pointwise bounded by the inductive hypothesis .",

    "we show that compact data fields , which belong to a subclass of the solutions studied in @xcite , are better behaved .",
    "since the coordinates @xmath249 ( or @xmath250 ) cover only the exterior region of the black hole , we need to switch to advanced coordinates @xmath251 in order to properly state this problem .",
    "note that @xmath252 become linearly dependent at the horizon and that the norm of @xmath253 vanishes when @xmath254 .",
    "thus , although we have proved the pointwise boundedness of partial derivatives along the coordinates @xmath255 , which are suitable and span the tangent space at any point outside the horizon , the study of the transverse derivatives @xmath256 _ at the horizon _ requires a separate treatment",
    ".    in advanced coordinates , ( [ metric1 ] ) reads @xmath257 and the scalar wave equation is @xmath258    theorem 1 in @xcite states that for every @xmath176 there exists a set of constants @xmath259 such that the functions @xmath260 $ ] , defined on the horizon @xmath39 as @xmath261 : = \\left[{\\partial}_r^{\\ell + 1 } \\phi_{\\ell}+ \\sum_{i=0}^{\\ell } \\beta_i    { \\partial}_r^{i } \\phi_{\\ell } \\right]_{r = m},\\ ] ] are constant along the horizon generators , i.e. , they depend on @xmath262 but not on @xmath43 . here , @xmath263 is the projection of @xmath27 onto the @xmath264 dimensional @xmath176 harmonic space on @xmath94 ( as in equation ( [ pl ] ) ) , which is itself a solution of the wave equation .",
    "this theorem implies that a generic solution @xmath27 of the wave equation within the class studied in @xcite does not admit a time integral solution @xmath265 in the sense of ( [ tf ] ) , as the existence of such a time integral would imply that @xmath260 = { \\partial}_v h_{\\ell } [ \\tilde \\phi ] \\equiv 0 $ ] , whereas the @xmath260 $ ] are generically non - trivial for these fields , as they evolve from data give on a surface crossing the horizon , and the data are generically non - trivial at the horizon .",
    "the reason why this result does not contradict lemma [ l : int - time ] above lies in the fact that the solutions of compact data studied here are a subclass of the set studied in @xcite , and the @xmath260 $ ] trivially vanish for this subclass , as can be seen by taking the limit @xmath266 along horizon generators ( where eventually @xmath27 is trivial ) , and using the fact that @xmath260 $ ] does not depend on @xmath43 .",
    "theorem 6 in @xcite states that some transverse derivatives at the horizon blow up along generators , more precisely , @xmath267 where the limit is taken along a horizon generator , i.e. , @xmath268 while keeping @xmath39 , and @xmath262 fixed .",
    "the proof of this theorem , however , requires that the @xmath260 $ ] be non trivial , and so this result does not hold for compact data solutions .",
    "the worst divergences of transverse derivatives along the horizon reported in @xcite come from the @xmath269 piece of @xmath27 .",
    "let us then assume , for simplicity , that @xmath270 is a spherically symmetric solution of ( [ boxvr ] ) , then the last term in ( [ boxvr ] ) vanishes and @xmath271 where @xmath272 means `` equal at the horizon '' . integrating this equation , we prove the constancy along the horizon generators of @xmath273={\\partial}_r \\phi + \\tfrac{1}{m } \\phi,\\ ] ] which is one of the @xmath274 referred to above .",
    "note that this conserved quantity implies the boundedness of @xmath275 at the horizon .",
    "if we take the @xmath276-derivative of equation ( [ boxvr ] ) , evaluate this equation at the horizon , and then use the original equation ( [ boxvr ] ) ( evaluated at the horizon ) to eliminate the term @xmath277 we obtain @xmath278 where in the last equality we have used equation . integrating this equation in @xmath43 , and using ( [ h0 ] ) gives @xmath279 since @xmath280 for large @xmath43 along a horizon generator and some constant @xmath28 @xcite , it follows from that , if @xmath281 , @xmath282 along generators .",
    "however , for fields with compact data , @xmath283 in implies that @xmath284 in this same limit , @xmath285 a constant .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of compact data fields . +",
    "now suppose that @xmath265 belongs to the class studied by aretakis .",
    "then we could rewrite as @xmath286 and use boundedness of @xmath287 to prove boundedness of @xmath288 at the horizon .",
    "more generally , we could apply ( [ div ] ) to @xmath265 and arrive at @xmath289    we do not have a proof that @xmath265 could be extended to a field in the class of solutions in @xcite , as , in principle , @xmath265 is only defined in the open set @xmath41 .",
