    "critical point theory has been of central importance in many areas of mathematics . in riemannian geometry , however , the most natural functions are distance functions and , due to their possible lack of differentiability at the cut locus , it was not clear for some time what a critical point should be . this situation was corrected in @xcite , where a point @xmath0 in a riemannian manifold @xmath1 was considered to be _ critical _ for @xmath3 if the set of tangent vectors to minimal geodesics connecting @xmath3 to @xmath0 forms a @xmath4-net at the unit tangent sphere at @xmath0 .    the surveys @xcite and @xcite , as well as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) , make plain the importance of critical point theory for distance functions and its use in giving unified conceptual proofs of many of the main results in riemannian geometry .",
    "nevertheless , it is rare to see critical points studied by themselves .",
    "an exception to this is @xcite , where the authors prove that any point @xmath0 in a closed alexandrov surface has to be critical for some point @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of this note is to give a short proof of this fact for closed riemannian manifolds of arbitrary dimension .",
    "our proof , however , does not carry over to alexandrov spaces .",
    "[ t : smooth ] let @xmath1 be a closed riemannian manifold .",
    "then , for any point @xmath5 , there exists at least one point @xmath2 such that @xmath0 is critical for the distance function from @xmath3 .",
    "observe that this theorem is no longer true in the non - compact case .",
    "for example , in euclidean space no point is critical for any point .",
    "a naive approach to proving theorem  [ t : smooth ] would be to look for the point @xmath3 among the points at maximal distance from @xmath0 .",
    "this , however , fails , as shown for the surface of revolution in figure  [ f : ellipsoid ] .",
