    "using maupertuis principle and the results in @xcite , one obtains a proof of the existence of at least two distinct homoclinic orbits for an autonomous lagrangian system emanating from a nondegenerate maximum point of the potential energy and reaching a regular level of the potential having the same value of the maximum point .",
    "moreover one obtain also a proof of the existence of at least two distinct _ brake orbits _ for a class of hamiltonian systems , connecting the two connected components of the boundary of the potential well . in this paper",
    "we show , by construction of examples , that this kind of estimate can not be improved .",
    "recall that maupertuis principle relates solutions of dynamical systems at a fixed energy level , with geodesics in metrics that are conformal to the kinetic energy ( jacobi metrics ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "it is easy to produce examples of _ spherical annuli _ ,",
    "i.e. , riemannian annuli with strongly concave boundary , that admit only two orthogonal geodesic chords , see @xcite",
    ". however , in principle the mere existence of spherical annuli with only two orthogonal geodesic chords does not provide examples of lagrangian or hamiltonian systems as above with only two homoclinics or brake orbits at a given energy level .",
    "namely , such examples do not necessarily arise from dynamical systems via maupertuis principle .",
    "the point addressed in the present paper is to describe a sort of inverse process of maupertuis principle , in other words , how to go from orthogonal geodesics to brake orbits . given a spherical annulus , we construct a @xmath5-potential function @xmath6 in an open subset of @xmath7 , and an energy level @xmath8 which is non critical for @xmath6 , such that the corresponding brake orbits of energy @xmath8 and connecting the two different connecteed components of the boundary of the potential well are into one - to - one correspondence with the orthogonal geodesic chords in the spherical annulus .",
    "it is an interesting observation that the construction of such a potential @xmath6 relies on an abstract characterization of geodesics in conformal metrics which is proved in section  [ sec : costruzionegeo ] .",
    "such a characterization , which has an independent interest in its own , is given in terms of a sort of converse of the classical gauss lemma in riemannian geometry .",
    "roughly speaking , a family of curves starting orthogonally to a given hypersurface of a riemannian manifold are geodesics in some conformal metric if and only if gauss lemma holds for the family , see proposition  [ thm : recgausslemma ] for a precise statement .",
    "in theorem [ thm : deubo ] it is got the existence of potentials having only two brake orbits connecting the two connected components of the potential well .",
    "the analogous results for homoclinics is given in theorem [ thm : deuhom ] .",
    "the problem of the multiplicity for brake orbits and homoclinics is widely studied .",
    "we refer for example to the papers @xcite@xcite and reference therein , for an updated list of results in this field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : gauss ] we give a result concerning constructions of potentials with prescribed geodesics for the related conformal metric . in section [ sec : ogcbo ] we give the concrete construction of the potentials extending a given potential in the unit disk .",
