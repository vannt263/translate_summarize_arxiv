    "the subject of black hole thermodynamics continues to bean important topic in gravitational physics . inspired in particular by the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite , the thermodynamical properties and phase transitions of the black holes in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space have gained much attention . utilizing the ads / cft correspondence , the hawking - page phase transition between a stable large black hole and a thermal gas @xcite was explained as the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of a gauge field @xcite .",
    "the study was also generalized to the charged ads black hole . in the grand canonical ensemble with fixed electric potential",
    ", there also exists the hawking - page phase transition .",
    "however , in the canonical ensemble with fixed charge , @xmath5@xmath6 displays an oscillatory behavior and the free energy exhibits a swallow tail behavior , which confirms a small / large black hole phase transition reminiscent of a liquid / gas transition of the van der waals ( vdw ) fluid @xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "the phase transition will become a second - order one .",
    "similar critical phenomena can also be found for the kerr - newman - ads black hole @xcite .",
    "moreover , the critical phenomena were also found in the @xmath7-@xmath8 diagram for the charged ads black hole @xcite , and for other ads black holes @xcite .",
    "although the small / large black hole phase transition behaves like a vdw fluid , the precise analogy was not established until recently by kubiznak and mann in ref .",
    "@xcite in the extended phase space , where the cosmological constant was treated as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as the thermodynamic volume of the ads black hole @xcite .",
    "this rejuvenated the study of the ads black hole thermodynamics , including the @xmath9-@xmath10 criticality , phase structure , and so on .",
    "many works demonstrated that such critical phenomena are presented in charged ads black hole systems @xcite .",
    "they have the same critical exponents and scaling laws , as well as the similar @xmath9-@xmath10 oscillatory behaviors and coexistence curves . in analogy to a vdw fluid",
    ", we recently introduced the number density of black hole molecules to measure the microscopic degrees of freedom of black holes @xcite .",
    "it was found that the number density suffers a sudden change accompanied by a latent heat when the black hole system crosses the small - large black hole coexistence curve .",
    "however , when the system passes the critical point , it encounters a second - order phase transition with a vanishing latent heat due to the continuous change of the number density .",
    "therefore , the difference between the number densities of the small and large black holes provides us with an order parameter to describe the small / large black hole phase transition .",
    "the system is also found to possess a maximum number density @xmath11 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath12 of the vdw fluid .",
    "these results further confirm that the small - large black hole phase transition is of vdw type .",
    "moreover , multicritical phenomena  such as the reentrant phase transition and triple point  were also observed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the extended phase space ,",
    "the rotating ads black holes have richer phase structure . through the gibbs free energy ,",
    "the four - dimensional kerr - ads black hole was found to possess a small / large black hole phase transition @xcite , which is similar to the charged ads black hole .",
    "the five - dimensional singly rotating kerr - ads black hole also has such a phenomenon @xcite .",
    "however , when the dimension @xmath0 increases or the multiply rotating parameters are presented , the case becomes much more exciting .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite first found the reentrant large / small / large black hole phase transition in the @xmath13-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black hole system .",
    "for the @xmath13-dimensional multiply spinning kerr - ads black hole with two fixed angular momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the system has a triple point and solid / liquid / gas analogue phase transition in some parameter ranges @xcite , and more than one critical point was found .",
    "a similar phase structure can also be found for higher - dimensional or multiply - rotating - parameter kerr - ads black holes .",
    "these exciting results imply that the ads black hole system behaves like a multicomponent fluid system .    among the study of the critical phenomena of the rotating ads black hole , one important issue is to find the exact critical point . for a specific value of the angular momentum @xmath16 , one can numerically solve the critical point .",
    "however , the specific form of the point is very hard to obtain . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors first expanded the state equation and all quantities in the small-@xmath16 limit and obtained an approximate critical point for the @xmath0-dimensional singly rotating kerr - ads black hole .",
    "as is known , the appearance of the reentrant phase transition requires more than one critical point .",
    "so there still exists another critical point that has not been found for @xmath4 .",
    "another question is how the critical points behave at large @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the exact critical points for the @xmath0-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ classification ] , we divide the thermodynamic quantities into two classes according to their different properties . based on this",
    ", we get the explicit form of the critical point using the dimensional analysis . in sec . [ maxwell ] , we discuss the generalized maxwell equal - area laws in the extended phase space for the kerr - ads black hole , and give three critical conditions , which can be used to determine the critical points . in sec .",
    "[ kerrads ] , the analytical critical point for the four - dimensional kerr - ads black hole is derived .",
    "the phase diagram and the coexistence curve are obtained .",
    "moreover , the exact critical points for @xmath29 cases are derived .",
    "it is also found that there exist two critical points for @xmath4 . comparing the approximate critical points obtained in the small-@xmath16 limit @xcite with our exact ones , we find that the approximate critical points are not only accurate for small @xmath16 , but they are also valid for large @xmath16 . the exact critical reentrant phase transition points ( crps )",
    "are derived in sec .",
    "[ reentrant ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "before investigating the critical phenomena , we would like to give a simple classification of the thermodynamic quantities , and discuss the relation between the classification and the critical point .",
    "let us start with the equation of state of a vdw fluid , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the specific volume with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the volume and total number of the molecules for the fluid system .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 come from the corrections of attraction between the molecules and the nonzero size of the molecules . for different fluids ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 take different values . from this equation",
    ", we have five parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath19 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . in general",
    ", we can divide them into two classes .",
    "the first class consists of _ universal parameters _ such as the pressure @xmath9 , volume @xmath19 , and temperature @xmath23which describe the universal properties of an ordinary thermodynamic system .",
    "the second class consists of the _",
    "characteristic parameters_such as @xmath21 and @xmath22which describe the characteristic properties of a thermodynamic system .    with such classifications",
    ", we can further discuss the critical point and the coexistence curve .",
    "after examining the concept of the critical point , we note that the critical point can be interpreted as the relation between the universal and characteristic parameters .",
    "for example , one has the following critical point for the vdw fluid : @xmath24 and the @xmath9-@xmath23 coexistence curve is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a function of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "it seems that such an analysis does not provides us with a new result for the phase transition .",
    "however , if a system has only one characteristic parameter , what will happen ?",
    "for example , the @xmath0-dimensional charged ads black hole and singly spinning kerr - ads black hole are both single - characteristic - parameter systems .",
    "the critical point and coexistence curve for @xmath0-dimensional charged ads black hole are already known",
    ". we will first take it as a simple example , and then apply the analysis to the rotating kerr - ads black hole .",
    "we first list the length dimensions of the relevant parameters in units of @xmath27 , @xmath28&= & l^{-2},\\quad [ t]=l^{-1 } , \\quad [ v]=l^{d-1},\\nonumber\\\\   ~[v]&= & l,\\quad [ j]=l^{d-2 } , \\quad [ q]=l^{d-3 } , \\quad [ s]=l^{d-2}.\\label{dimension}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the charged ads black hole is a single - characteristic - parameter system , the critical point should have the following form according to eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are dimensionless constants and can be determined by the critical condition , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the specific values for these coefficients can be found in ref .",
    "the parametrization form of the coexistence curve can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be in the form of eq .",
    "( [ coe ] ) if we express them in the ordinary parameter space .",
    "note that we obtain the form for the critical points without any calculation .",
    "now , we would like to turn to the singly spinning kerr - ads black hole . combined with the dimensional analysis , the critical point must be in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 are dimensionless constants .",
    "now we have given the explicit form of the critical point without any approximation for the singly spinning kerr - ads black hole .",
    "from such an analysis , we see that the exact value of the critical point should exist , and the coefficients @xmath33 will be determined in the following sections .",
    "another byproduct is that the universal ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 are dimensionless constants . for the charged ads black hole , we have @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , we will examine the equal - area laws for the rotating ads black hole , and use them to show the critical conditions .    in the extended phase space ,",
    "the cosmological constant is treated as a new thermodynamic variable @xcite , i.e. , the pressure @xmath38 with such an interpretation of the cosmological constant , the first law of the black hole thermodynamics is modified as @xmath39 compared with that of the vdw fluid , the black hole mass @xmath40 should be identified with the enthalpy @xmath41 rather than the internal energy , and @xmath42 is related to the thermodynamic volume of the system .",
    "this system has three pairs of intensive / extensive variables , i.e. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the gibbs free energy for the system reads @xmath46 differentiating it , we get @xmath47 each point located on the coexistence curve corresponds to two states , labeled as  a \" and  b \" .",
    "they are in different system phases but have the same gibbs free energy .",
    "then we have @xmath48 , which leads to @xmath49 integrating the above equation from  a \" to  b \" , one easily obtains @xmath50 as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain the generalized equal - area laws by only varying one parameter and keeping the other fixed .",
    "* case i : * @xmath16 and @xmath9 fixed . equation ( [ area ] ) reduces to @xmath51 then following the simple calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can construct the equal - area law on the @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory line .",
    "* case ii : * @xmath16 and @xmath23 fixed .",
    "equation ( [ area ] ) gives @xmath53 thus , we can construct the equal - area law on the @xmath9-@xmath19 oscillatory line .",
    "* case iii : * @xmath9 and @xmath23 fixed .",
    "we have @xmath54 the equal - area law can also be constructed in a similar way .    in summary",
    ", there are three oscillatory lines : the @xmath23-@xmath52 , @xmath9-@xmath19 , and @xmath16-@xmath55 lines . along these three curves",
    ", we can construct three equal - area laws .",
    "they are consistent with each other and are effective for finding the phase transition points .",
    "it was recently found that there exists a small / large black hole phase transition of the vdw type for a rotating ads black hole @xcite . in general ,",
    "the coexistence curve shown in the @xmath9-@xmath23 diagram has a positive slope , and it terminates at a critical point as the temperature @xmath23 increases .",
    "the critical point can be determined by the oscillatory curves .",
    "since there are three curves , we have three kinds of critical conditions to determine the critical point . here",
    "we list all of them : @xmath56 to obtain the critical point one can use the first condition , which has been adopted in many works .",
    "in fact , the other two are also effective for obtaining the critical point .",
    "next , we will show that the exact value of the critical point can be well determined by the second condition .    applying the same technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the generalized clapeyron equations can be obtained for the kerr - ads black hole in the extended phase space : @xmath57 they hold for a singly spinning kerr - ads black hole with any dimension @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we will reexamine the phase transition of the four - dimensional kerr - ads black hole . at firstly , we give a brief review of its thermodynamics .",
    "the line element of the kerr - ads black hole is given by @xmath58 where the metric functions read @xmath59 the thermodynamic quantities are @xmath60 where @xmath6 is the horizon radius of the black hole .",
    "the mass @xmath40 and angular momentum @xmath16 are related to the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath21 as @xmath62 the gibbs free energy of the black hole is @xmath63 moreover , we can express the temperature , gibbs free energy , and thermodynamic volume in terms of @xmath52 , @xmath16 , and @xmath9 : @xmath64 the specific volume can be determined with @xmath65 .",
    "in general , the heat capacity implies a local thermodynamic stability : positive and negative heat capacities correspond to the stable and unstable systems , respectively .",
    "it should also be noted that the phase transition takes place at the divergent point of the heat capacity . for a rotating kerr - ads",
    "black hole , the heat capacity at fixed @xmath16 and @xmath9 is @xmath66      it is shown that a small / large black hole phase transition of the vdw type exists in the background of the charged or rotating ads black hole . for the charged ads black hole",
    ", the thermodynamic volume depends only on the black hole horizon radius .",
    "thus , the critical point can be easily determined by the condition ( [ crit1 ] ) . however , for the rotating ads black hole , the thermodynamic volume depends both on the angular momentum and the radius , which increases the difficulty of obtaining the critical point with eq .",
    "( [ crit1 ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors expanded all quantities to @xmath67 in the small-@xmath16 limit and obtained an approximate critical point , which reads @xmath68 the relation in turn yields the universal critical ratio @xmath69 , which is different from the value @xmath70 for the vdw fluid . however , the critical exponents are the same as the vdw fluid , i.e. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors further approximated the exact equation of state by the slow - rotating expansion to a higher order .",
    "the critical point is slightly shifted from the preceding values , and the universal critical ratio @xmath75 deviates from @xmath76 by a small amount .",
    "however , the result shows that the critical exponents are the same as the ones obtained before .",
    "although refs .",
    "@xcite provided a good approximation to the exact equation of state , and reproduced the critical point , these results are based on the small-@xmath16 limit .",
    "one may wish to obtain the exact value of the critical point for any @xmath16 . in the following",
    ", we will reexamine this issue .",
    "recall that the reason we could not obtain the exact critical point is mainly due to the fact that the thermodynamic and specific volumes are @xmath16 dependent ( see eqs .",
    "( [ tt ] ) and ( [ vv ] ) ) .",
    "this will make the condition ( [ crit1 ] ) hard to deal with , and the exact critical point can not be obtained .",
    "however , as we shown before , there also exist other conditions to determine the critical point ( see eqs .",
    "( [ crit2 ] ) and ( [ crit3 ] ) ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the @xmath16-@xmath55 criticality for the @xmath1-dimensional kerr - ads black hole .",
    "the condition ( [ crit3 ] ) was used , but analytical critical points were still not obtained . thus the condition ( [ crit2 ] ) may be an alternative choice .",
    "combined with eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) , the condition @xmath77 reduces to @xmath78 recalling that the critical point must be in the form of eq .",
    "( [ criticalpoint ] ) , we only need to determine the dimensionless constants @xmath32 .",
    "fortunately , the above two complicated equations have an analytical solution : @xmath79{j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80{103 - 3 \\sqrt{87}}\\nonumber\\\\      & -&17\\left(103 - 3\\sqrt{87}\\right)^{2/3 }     \\left(484826973\\sqrt{87}-5116133497\\right)-\\sqrt[3]{2}\\left(68098470527 + 5855463275     \\sqrt{87}\\right)\\bigg),\\nonumber\\\\    k_{2}&=&\\frac{2}{3}\\left(2+\\sqrt[3]{206 - 6\\sqrt{87}}+\\sqrt[3]{206 + 6\\sqrt{87}}\\right).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] through examining the divergent behavior of the heat capacity @xmath81 , dolan @xcite found the exact numerical value of the critical point for the @xmath1-dimensional kerr - ads black hole , which is consistent with our analytical result .",
    "it is also worth noting that the derivation of the analytical critical point has no approximation , and thus the result is valid for any value of @xmath16 . in order to make a comparison with the approximate one given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the small-@xmath16 limit ) , we define the relative deviation @xmath82 for a thermodynamic quantity @xmath83 , with @xmath84 denoting the critical point obtained in the small-@xmath16 limit",
    ". then we get @xmath85 from which we can see that the deviations between the analytical and approximate values of the critical point are very small , i.e. , within the range of 2.2% .",
    "the analytical values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are smaller than the approximate ones , while @xmath88 and @xmath89 are larger .",
    "a special property of these deviations is that they are independent of the angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "this property seems very difficult to understand because that the approximate value of the critical point is obtained in the small-@xmath16 limit , while the analytical ones are effective for all @xmath16 .",
    "the reason is that the kerr - ads black hole is a single - characteristic - parameter system , and its critical point has a unique form . with a simple calculation",
    ", one can confirm that the critical exponents and the scaling laws near such an exact critical point are the same as the ones obtained before .",
    "there are classical swallowtail behavior of gibbs free energy and @xmath9-@xmath19 oscillatory behavior when the phase transition takes place . in this subsection",
    ", we will study the phase transition information encoded in the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in fact , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the phase transition information is also encoded in the @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior .",
    "we show the swallowtail behavior of @xmath90 and @xmath91-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior for different values of the pressure @xmath9 in fig .",
    "we conclude that the existence of the swallowtail behavior implies the @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior .",
    "and the deflection point of @xmath90 corresponds to the extremal point of the @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior .",
    "however , when the pressure @xmath92 , both the swallowtail behavior and @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior disappear .    for small pressure @xmath9 ,",
    "there are two extremal points on one @xmath23-@xmath52 curve , and the two points coincide with each other when @xmath93 . when @xmath94 , there is no extremal point .",
    "the extremal points are determined by @xmath95 thus the critical point occurs at the multiple root of the above equation . for a black hole with @xmath96",
    ", we have @xmath97 thus , it is clear that the heat capacity @xmath98 diverges at the extremal points determined by eq .",
    "( [ extremal ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is known that a negative slope of the @xmath23-@xmath52 curve corresponds to a negative @xmath98 , which implies unstable thermodynamics .",
    "since the intermediate black hole branch has a negative slope on the @xmath23-@xmath52 curve , it should be excluded from the thermodynamic viewpoint .    the ability to exclude such a branch comes from the consideration that a thermodynamic system always prefers a lower gibbs free energy . when @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ gtsa ] ) , as @xmath23 increase the system first prefers a small black hole branch until the point  p \" is reached , where the small and large black hole branches have the same value of @xmath90 .",
    "so it is a coexistence point of the small and large black holes . as @xmath23 increase further",

    "these lines construct two areas .",

    "so there is no equal - area law on the @xmath23-@xmath19 oscillatory line .",
    "the branch  cd \" with a negative slope corresponds to the intermediate black hole .",
    "we remove this branch by replacing the  be \" oscillatory line with the red horizontal line .",

    "finally , we obtain the exact critical point @xmath122 the phase diagram is similar to the case of @xmath1 , and we will not explore it .      for the @xmath0=6-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black hole ,",
    "the reentrant phase transition emerges , which provides an opportunity to determine the phase structure of the ads black hole .",
    "the study is also generalized to equal - spinning kerr - ads black holes in @xmath0-dimensions . however , the exact critical point is still missing .",
    "we would like to find the exact value for it with the method presented for the @xmath2 case .",
    "we fist list the extremal point in fig .",
    "[ 6ps ] . from it",
    ", one can see that the structure of the extremal point is richer than the @xmath2 case implying a richer phase structure .",
    "this structure admits two critical points : @xmath123 to be clear , we show the @xmath23-@xmath52 oscillatory behavior in fig .",
    "the isobar behaves differently at different pressures ( for details , one can see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . considering that the black hole near the first critical point always has a higher gibbs free energy than the very large black hole , the first critical point will not emerge in the phase diagram .",
    "however , if the very large black hole branch is suppressed by some other physical mechanisms , then the first critical point will appear in the phase diagram .",
    "+      @xmath124-dimensional kerr - ads black holes have similar critical phenomena as the @xmath13 case . here",
    "we present the extremal points for @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ 789ps ] , which are very similar to the @xmath13 case shown in fig .",
    "there are two critical points for @xmath124 , which we list in table [ parameters ] .",
    "similar to the @xmath13 case , the first critical point does not participate in the phase transition .",
    "when @xmath126 , the calculation becomes more difficult .",
    "however we believe that the situation is the same as @xmath13 .    before ending this section , we give a brief summary .",
    "for @xmath29 , we obtain the exact critical points . when @xmath2 , there is only one critical point , and the critical phenomena is the same as @xmath1 . when @xmath4 , there are two critical points , and the reentrant phase transition emerges .",
    "all the critical points are exact without any approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors gave the approximate critical point ( [ appcrit ] ) in the small-@xmath16 limit , which is consistent with the second critical point obtained by us .",
    "we list the relative deviations of the critical pressure and temperature in table [ ii ] .",
    "it is clear that , the approximate one has small deviations @xmath127 and @xmath128 from the exact one . with an increase of the dimension @xmath0 , the deviations decrease .",
    "although the approximate critical points were obtained in the small-@xmath16 limit , they are still effective for large @xmath16 , which is mainly because the singly spinning kerr - ads black hole system is a single - characteristic - parameter system .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the critical phenomena of the @xmath0-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black holes .",
    "we first examined the thermodynamic quantities for such a system , and they are divided into two classes .",
    "the first class consists of the universal parameters , such as @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the second class consists of the characteristic parameters , such as the @xmath7 and @xmath16 .",
    "the phase transition and critical phenomenon are dependent on the characteristic parameters . since the @xmath0-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black hole system",
    "is a single - characteristic - parameter system , the critical point has an explicit form , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ criticalpoint ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the critical point , we only need to derive the coefficients @xmath130 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the critical point determined by this method is exact and obtained without any approximation .",
    "then we considered the generalized maxwell equal - area laws in the extended phase space , and three critical conditions were obtained . employing the condition ( [ crit2 ] ) and the unique form of the critical point ( [ criticalpoint ] )",
    ", we obtained the analytical and exact critical points for the kerr - ads black hole for the first time .",
    "we obtained the analytical critical point for the four - dimensional kerr - ads black hole .",
    "the coexistence curve and the phase diagram were also obtained .",
    "a fitting form of the coexistence curve in the @xmath9-@xmath23 phase diagram was presented , and it was found to be angular momentum @xmath16 independent .",
    "the @xmath9-@xmath19 and @xmath23-@xmath19 phase diagrams were also given .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath23-@xmath19 phase diagram , besides the small and large black hole phases , we gave two extra subphases , i.e. , the superheated small black hole phase and supercooled large black hole phase .",
    "when @xmath2 , the critical phenomena are similar to the four - dimensional case , while when @xmath4 the reentrant phase transition occurs , and two exact critical points are presented .",
    "however , the small one does not participate in the phase transition . through a simple calculation",
    ", we showed that the approximate critical point ( [ appcrit ] ) obtained in the small-@xmath16 limit is accurate not only valid for small @xmath16 , but also for large @xmath16 .",
    "the reason is that the singly spinning kerr - ads black hole system is a single - characteristic - parameter system , and the form of the critical point is uniquely determined .    when @xmath4 , the reentrant phase transitions appear .",
    "based on the similar analysis for the critical point , we obtained the exact crps for @xmath139 .",
    "finally , we suggested that the success in obtaining the analytical and exact critical points is mainly based on the fact that the @xmath0-dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads black hole is a single - characteristic - parameter system .",
    "thus the form of the critical point is uniquely determined . for the multiply spinning black hole",
    ", this method fails , and the forms of the critical points can not be easily determined using only the dimensional analysis . however , for the equal - spinning ( @xmath131 ) kerr - ads black holes , this method is valid .",
