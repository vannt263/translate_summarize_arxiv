    "the cauchy problem for the camassa  holm ( ch ) equation @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant , has attracted much attention due to the fact that it serves as a model for shallow water waves @xcite and its rich mathematical structure .",
    "for example , it has a bi - hamiltonian structure , infinitely many conserved quantities and blow - up phenomena have been studied , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we here focus on the construction of the lipschitz metric for the semigroup of conservative solutions on the real line .",
    "this problem has been recently considered by grunert , holden , and raynaud @xcite in the periodic case , and here we want to present how the approach used there has to be modified in the non - periodic case .    for simplicity , we will only discuss the case @xmath12 , that is , @xmath13 and from now on we refer to as the ch equation .",
    "however , the approach presented here can also handle the generalized hyperelastic - rod equation , see remark [ rem : genhyp ] .",
    "in particular , it includes the case with nonzero @xmath14 .",
    "the generalized hyperelastic - rod equation has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath15 where @xmath9 and @xmath16 are smooth functions .",
    "is assumed to be strictly convex or concave . ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we recover for any @xmath14 . with @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the hyperelastic - rod wave equation : @xmath21 which has been introduced by dai @xcite .",
    "equation can be rewritten as the following system @xmath22 where we choose @xmath3 to be an element of @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath6 norm is preserved as @xmath24 for any smooth solution @xmath3 . however , even for smooth initial data , the solution may break down in finite time . in this case , the solution experiences wave breaking ( @xcite ) : the solution remains bounded while , at some point , the spatial derivative @xmath25 tends to @xmath26 .",
    "this phenomenon can be nicely illustrated by the so called multipeakon solutions .",
    "these are solutions of the form @xmath27 let us consider the case with @xmath28 and one peakon @xmath29 ( moving to the right ) and one antipeakon @xmath30 ( moving to the left ) . in the symmetric case ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) the solution @xmath3 will vanish pointwise at the collision time @xmath33 when @xmath34 , that is , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . at time @xmath37 , the whole energy is concentrated at the origin , and we have @xmath38 , with @xmath39 denoting the dirac delta distribution at the origin . in general",
    "we have two possibilities to continue the solution beyond wave breaking , namely to set @xmath3 identically equal to zero for @xmath40 , which is called a dissipative solution , or to let the peakons pass through each other , which is called a conservative solution and which is depicted in figure [ fig : peakcol ] .",
    "we are interested in the latter case , for which solutions have been studied by bressan and constantin @xcite and holden and raynaud @xcite",
    ". since the @xmath6-norm is preserved , the space @xmath6 appears as a natural space for the semigroup of solutions .",
    "however , the previous multipeakon example reveals the opposite .",
    "indeed , @xmath35 for all @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the trivial solution @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , which is also a conservative solution , coincides with @xmath3 at @xmath37 . to define a semigroup of conservative solutions ,",
    "we therefore need more information about the solution than just its pointwise values , for instance , the amount and location of the energy which concentrates on sets of zero measure .",
    "this justifies the introduction of the set @xmath45 of eulerian coordinates , see definition [ def : d ] , for which a semigroup can be constructed @xcite .    furthermore , the @xmath6 norm is not well suited to establish a stability result .",
    "consider , e.g. , the sequence of multipeakons @xmath46 defined as @xmath47 , see figure  [ fig : peakcol ] .",

    "a detailed presentation for the camassa ",
    "holm equation in the periodic case is presented in @xcite , thus we here focus on explaining the differences between the periodic case and the decaying case .",
    "however , we first present the general construction .",
    "the construction of the metric is closely connected to the construction of the semigroup itself .",
    "let us outline this construction .",
    "we rewrite the ch equation in lagrangian coordinates and obtain a semilinear system of ordinary differential equations : let @xmath54 denote the solution and @xmath55 the corresponding characteristics , thus @xmath56 .",
    "then our new variables are @xmath55 , as well as @xmath57 where @xmath58 corresponds to the lagrangian velocity while @xmath59 can be interpreted as the lagrangian cumulative energy distribution .",
    "the time evolution for any @xmath60 is described by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 this system is well - posed as a locally lipschitz system of ordinary differential equations in a banach space , and we can define a semigroup of solution which we denote @xmath64 . from standard theory for ordinary differential equations",
    "we know that @xmath64 is locally lipschitz continuous , that is , given @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 for any @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath69 depends only on @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "the mapping from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates is surjective but not bijective .",
    "the discrepancy between the two sets of coordinates is due to the freedom of relabeling in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the relabeling functions form a group , which we denote @xmath70 , and which basically consists of the diffeomorphisms of the line with some additional assumptions ( see definition [ def : gr ] ) .",
    "given @xmath60 , the element @xmath71 is the relabeled version of @xmath72 by the relabeling function @xmath73 . using the fact that the semigroup @xmath64 is equivariant with respect to relabeling ,",
    "that is , @xmath74 we can construct a semigroup of solutions on equivalence classes from @xmath64 . finally ,",
    "after establishing the existence of a bijection between the eulerian coordinates and the equivalence classes in lagrangian coordinates , we can transport the semigroup of solutions defined on equivalence classes and construct a semigroup , which we denote @xmath75 , of conservative solutions in @xmath45 .",
    "we want to find a metric which makes @xmath75 lipschitz continuous . for that purpose",
    ", we introduce a pseudometric which is symmetric , @xmath76 , for which the triangle inequality @xmath77 holds , and satisfies @xmath78 for @xmath79 . ] in lagrangian coordinates which does not distinguish between elements of the same equivalence class and which , at the same time , leaves the semigroup @xmath64 locally lipschitz continuous .",
    "this strategy has been used in @xcite for the hunter  saxton equation and in @xcite for the camassa ",
    "holm equation in the periodic case . in @xcite ,",
    "the pseudometric is defined by using ideas from riemannian geometry . here , we follow the approach of @xcite and first",
    "introduce a pseudosemimetric which is symmetric , @xmath76 and satisfies @xmath78 for @xmath80 . ] which also identifies elements of the same equivalence class and leaves @xmath64 lipschitz continuous .",
    "a natural choice , which was applied in @xcite , is to consider the pseudometric @xmath81 defined as @xmath82 the pseudometric @xmath81 identifies elements of the same equivalence class , as @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , it is invariant with respect to relabeling , that is , @xmath84 for any @xmath85 .",
    "it remains to prove that the pseudosemimetric makes the semigroup @xmath64 locally lipschitz , that is , given @xmath66 and @xmath65 , there exists a constant @xmath86 depending on @xmath66 and @xmath65 such that @xmath87 for all @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath88 .",
    "the proof follows almost directly from the stability and equivariance of @xmath64 .",
    "we outline it here . for every @xmath53",
    ", there exist @xmath85 such that @xmath89 and we get    [ eq : notusstab ] @xmath90    and follows by letting @xmath91 tend to zero .",
    "however , the use of the lipschitz stability of @xmath64 relies on bounds on @xmath92 and @xmath93 that are unavailable .",
    "the problem is that the norm @xmath94 of the banach space is _ not _ invariant with respect to relabeling and therefore , since @xmath9 and @xmath16 are a priori arbitrary , we can not obtain any bound depending on @xmath66 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this motivates the introduction in this paper of the pseudosemimetric @xmath95 defined as @xmath96 as expected , the pseudosemimetric @xmath95 identifies equivalence classes ( we have @xmath97 ) but we lose the nice relabeling invariance property . at the same time",
    ", this definition of @xmath95 implies some implicit restrictions on the diffeomorphisms @xmath98 and @xmath99 which allow us to bound the relabeled versions @xmath100 and @xmath101 so that the approach sketched in can be carried out .",
    "it remains to explain why , in the periodic case @xcite , we could use the definition of @xmath102 , which is a more natural definition and moreover simplifies the proofs . in the periodic case",
    "( we take the period equal to one ) , the stability of the semigroup @xmath64 is established in the space @xmath103)$ ] equipped with the norm @xmath104)}={\\left\\vertu\\right\\vert}_{l^\\infty([0,1])}+{\\left\\vertu_\\xi\\right\\vert}_{l^1([0,1])}.\\ ] ] note that , in order to keep these formal explanations as simple as possible , we just consider the second component of @xmath60 . since @xmath105 and @xmath106 we have @xmath107 , for any @xmath73 , so that the norm defined in is relabeling invariant . now ,",
    "if the norm of the banach space is relabeling invariant , we have @xmath108 and the pseudosemimetrics @xmath95 and @xmath81 are equivalent . however , the natural banach space for @xmath58 is not @xmath103)$ ] but @xmath109)=h^1([0,1])$ ] . in the periodic case ,",
    "it is not an issue as @xmath110)\\subset w^{1,1}([0,1])$ ] but the corresponding embedding does not hold in the case of the real line .",
    "this also shows that the approach that we present here for the real line can also be used in the periodic case and that the novelty in this article is that we handle a norm which is not relabeling invariant .",
    "the final step consists of deriving a pseudometric from the pseudosemimetric @xmath95 .",
    "this can be achieved by the following general construction : let @xmath111 where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the pseudometric @xmath115 inherits the lipschitz stability property from @xmath95 .",
    "finally , identifying elements belonging to the same equivalence class , the pseudometric @xmath115 turns into a metric on the set of equivalence classes . by bijection ,",
    "it yields a metric in @xmath45 which makes the semigroup of conservative solutions lipschitz continuous .    in the last section , section [ sec : top ]",
    ", we compare this new metric with the usual norms in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in this section , we recall from @xcite the construction of the semigroup in lagrangian coordinates . the camassa ",
    "holm equation reads @xmath116 and can be rewritten as the following system @xmath117 @xmath118    next , we rewrite the equation in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "therefore we introduce the characteristics @xmath119 the lagrangian velocity @xmath58 reads @xmath120 we define the lagrangian cumulative energy as @xmath121 as an immediate consequence of the definition of the characteristics we obtain @xmath122 the last term can be expressed uniquely in terms of @xmath123 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . from we",
