    "after recombination , a large amount of neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium ( igm ) was reionized by stars and galaxies which emit uv and x - ray photons .",
    "this important phase of the universe , the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , has attracted much attention in a broad community of astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the gunn - peterson effect @xcite in the spectra of high - z quasars indicates that the reionization of hydrogen was completed by @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrated thomson scattering optical depth of the cmb photons implies the instantaneous reionization redshift of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "contrastingly , we have poor information on the start and the progress of the reionization and the nature of ionizing sources .    a direct observation of neutral hydrogen of the igm with the 21 cm line",
    "is expected to be a powerful tool to probe the cosmic dawn and the reionization .",
    "there are several ongoing telescopes which are beginning observations and getting constraints on the fluctuations in the 21 cm signal : the mwa @xcite , the lofar and the precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ) @xcite .",
    "although their sensitivities are not enough to obtain images of 21 cm signal during the eor , the statistical information on the 21cm - signal fluctuations is expected to be obtained after a sufficient subtraction of the foreground emission and some upper bounds on the power spectrum have already been placed @xcite .",
    "much higher sensitivity is required for the imaging of 21 cm signal and the square kilometre array ( ska ) will be the ultimate telescope for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum has often been used to analyze the statistical properties of the fluctuations in 21 cm signal .",
    "the variance of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the fluctuations is also a standard quantity which is simple to compute both theoretically and observationally , because it can be calculated by an integration of the power spectrum with respect to the wave number @xcite .",
    "both of them were shown to be very useful tools to probe the global history of the reionization and to constrain the parameters of eor models .",
    "the bispectrum and the skewness of the pdf , which is an integral of the bispectrum with respect to the wave number , are also fundamental statistical quantities which characterize the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these can measure the non - gaussianity of the fluctuations , which are naturally generated in the highly - nonlinear processes of the reionization and can not be captured by the power spectrum and variance . in @xcite , the thermal noise for the bispectrum observation was estimated and it was shown that the above ongoing telescopes have enough sensitivity to detect the bispectrum at large scales .",
    "further , @xcite showed that the skewness is a good indicator of the onset of the x - ray heating of the igm and the nature of the ionizing sources @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm pdf @xcite and the 21 cm difference pdf @xcite are also shown to be useful tools to study the reionization scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate , using fisher analysis , the potential of the variance and skewness to constrain some of the key parameters of an eor model .",
    "both of these are simple and suitable for the early exploration of the eor with 21 cm signal .",
    "we generate maps of the brightness temperature using a public semi - analytic code 21cmfast @xcite and estimate expected constraints on the model parameters by future observation data with the mwa and lofar .",
    "as explained above , the variance and skewness have complimentary information so that the combination will give us effective constraints on the parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the fluctuations in the brightness temperature and their statistical characterization .",
    "we explain our methodology in section 3 .",
    "first , we describe the simulation code we have used and show the basic properties of the variance and skewness .",
    "then , we describe the thermal noise to these quantities and explain fisher analysis for the estimation of the parameter constraints .",
    "the results are shown in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and give discussion in section 5 .",
    "the observable quantity of the redshifted 21 cm line is brightness temperature @xmath3 which is defined as the contrast between the spin temperature @xmath4 and the background cmb temperature @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath8 is the matter density fluctuation , @xmath9 is the hubble parameter and @xmath10 is the gradient of the proper velocity along the line of sight .",
    "the spin temperature is determined by the of number - density ratio of the singlet and triplet of a neutral hydrogen atom : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planck constant , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the number density and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the statistical weight of singlet and triplet , respectively . in order to analyze @xmath3",
    "statistically we define spacial fluctuation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spatial average of @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce variance and skewness in the next two subsections .      the power spectrum @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the ensemble average , @xmath23 is dirac s delta function , and the @xmath24 is the fourier transform of @xmath25 .    on the other hand , the variance is defined as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of pixels .",
    "furthermore , the variance can be calculated by an integral of power spectrum with respect to wave number , @xmath28 where the integration range is determined by the angular resolution and observation area . although the above two expressions are mathematically equivalent , eq . ( [ eq : variance2 ] ) is more practical for observations with interferometer because the fourier components , @xmath24 , can directly be obtained from visibility without aperture synthesis .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath29 is defined as : @xmath30 the delta function guarantees the triangle condition , @xmath31 . in literature , bispectra for specific shapes of triangles are often considered , such as equilateral type ( @xmath32 ) , folded type ( @xmath33 ) and squeezed type ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "skewness @xmath35 is defined as , @xmath36 similar to the case of variance , skewness can be calculated from an integral of the bispectrum as , @xmath37 here it should be noted that the integration contains all types of the bispectrum .",
    "while skewness is a simple statistical quantity as variance , a lot of information is lost through the process of integration .",
    "thus , in order to increase information and still keep the simpleness , we consider two kinds of `` skewness '' , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which counts contributions only from equilateral- and folded - type bispectra , respectively .",
    "we generate @xmath3 map at each redshift by a semi - analytic simulation code called 21cmfast @xcite . in this code , the matter density is initialized with @xmath40 dark matter particles at @xmath41 and the density and velocity fields are evolved through zeldovich approximation . then",
    ", the excursion set formalism is used to count dark matter haloes in the density field and luminous objects are assumed to reside in each halo . considering the emission of uv , ionizing and x - ray photons , thermal and ionizing states of intergalactic medium ( igm ) are calculated and the maps of brightness temperature and other physical quantities are provided .",
    "the results are in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations on scales larger than 1 mpc @xcite .",
    "there are three phenomenological parameters which significantly affect the structure and evolution of igm .",
    "* @xmath42 : the minimum virial temperature which gives the minimum mass of halos which host luminous objects .",
    "physically , this is determined by the cooling process of gas and significantly affected by the feedback from star formation .",
    "this quantity effectively parametrizes the efficiency of the feedback .",
    "* @xmath43 : ionizing efficiency of luminous objects , which includes the number of emitted ionizing photons per baryon and the escape fraction from galaxies . * @xmath44 : the ionizing photon horizon which can be chosen to match the extrapolated ionizing photon mean free path in the ionized igm .",
    "this represents the maximum distance which ionizing photons are allowed to propagate and effectively parametrizes the clumpiness of the igm and determines the maximum size of ionized bubbles .",
    "we form the evolved simulation boxes of @xmath45 with @xmath46 grids .",
    "we focus on the redshift range of @xmath47 to which ongoing telescopes are most sensitive .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath4 are neglected assuming @xmath48 at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the variance and skewness of @xmath3 are computed by integrating the power spectrum and bispectrum , respectively , which are obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath3 map . in the fisher analysis given below",
    ", we set the fiducial values of these parameters as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "for these parameter values , the reionization is completed at @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : skew - evo1 ] shows the evolution of the skewness @xmath35 of brightness temperature and its dependence of the above parameters as a function of redshift : @xmath42 ( top ) , @xmath43 ( mid ) and @xmath44 ( bottom ) . in each figure",
    ", the solid line represents the fiducial model . during the eor we are focusing on ( @xmath53 ) , the fluctuations in brightness temperature",
    "are mostly contributed from those in neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "the skewness increases as reionization proceeds and reaches its peak at @xmath54 where about half of hydrogen is ionized .",
    "after that , the skewness decreases and approaches to zero as the entire igm is eventually ionized at @xmath52 .    for a smaller value of @xmath55 , the number of halos with luminous objects increases so that reionization proceeds more quickly and the peak shifts to a higher redshift .",
    "increasing @xmath43 has a similar effect .",
    "as for @xmath44 , it does not affect the fluctuations until @xmath54 .",
    "this is because ionizing photons emitted from galaxies ionize the local neutral hydrogen in the early phase of reionization . in the later phase ,",
    "larger ionized bubbles are formed for a larger value of @xmath44 and , therefore , reionization is completed earlier .    similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : skew - evo2 ] shows the evolution of the skewness @xmath35 as a function of the neutral fraction .",

    "in this section , we show the results of fisher analysis . first of all , we argue the detectability of the variance and skewness with the mwa and lofar . it should be noted that the signal variance and skewness depend on the angular resolution and channel width of the telescope , and observation area due to the scale dependence of the power spectrum and bispectrum , respectively .",

    "the errors associated with the foreground subtraction and calibration were not considered and only the thermal noise was taken into account for fisher analysis .",
    "this is because there has been no study on the foreground and other systematics associated with the bispectrum and skewness so that we need to take only the thermal noises in order to treat the variance and skewness evenly .",
    "therefore , the parameter constraints are much stronger than those obtained from the power spectrum in the previous studies @xcite . for example",
    ", @xcite performed fisher analysis considering future measurements of the power spectrum of the brightness temperature in order to predict constraints on the same parameter set as in this work .",
    "they showed that their `` optimistic foreground model '' , which is almost free from the foreground contamination , results in parameter constraints which are better by a factor of 3 and 10 than their `` moderate foreground model '' , which takes the signal only within the `` eor window '' into account , for the mwa and lofar , respectively . comparing their case with `` optimistic foreground model '' to our results , our constraints are weaker by a factor of 3 - 4 for the mwa and 1.2 - 1.4 for the lofar .",
