    "in this contribution we briefly discuss our results on a unified normal model approach to dynamic tides and its applications published in ivanov , papaloizou @xmath0 chernov ( 2013 ) and chernov , papaloizou @xmath0 ivanov ( 2013 ) hereafter paper 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "our formalism is applicable when the tidal interactions are mainly determined by normal modes of a star with identifiable regular spectrum of low frequency modes , such as rotationally modified gravity modes . in this case",
    "it allows one to consider the well known theory of dynamic tides ( e.g. zahn 1977 , goodman @xmath0 dickson 1998 ) operating in binaries with periodic orbits as well as the excitation of normal modes as the result of a flyby around a perturbing body by a rotating star moving on a parabolic orbit as discussed by press @xmath0 teukolsky 1977 ( see also , e.g. lai 1997 , ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2004 , 2007 , hereafter ip7 ) .",
    "these are considered in a general way in parallel developments .",
    "it is shown that in general , energy and angular momentum transfer due to dynamic tides is determined by the so - called overlap integrals provided that a mechanism of dissipation of energy stored in normal modes is specified and orbital parameters together with the state of rotation of the star are given .",
    "it is stressed that in certain important cases , such as dynamic tides operating in the press @xmath0 teukolsky sense , or dynamic tides operating in the zahn sense in the regime of moderately large dissipation , for which internally excited waves travelling with their group velocity do not reach either the centre or boundary of the configuration on account of damping , the resulting expressions for either the energy and angular momentum transfer rates , or the total amount transferred in each case , do not depend on details of energy dissipation , see section [ s1 ] .",
    "in section [ s2 ] we briefly present the overlap integrals obtained for sun - like stars and stars with mass @xmath1 referring the reader to paper 1 and paper 2 , where these quantities are calculated numerically for a range of rotating population i stellar models of different masses and ages .",
    "these results are obtained for the slow rotation regime where centrifugal distortion is neglected in the equilibrium and the traditional approximation is made , and an analytical wkbj theory of their evaluation is developed for the case of sun - like rotating stars .    in section [ s3 ]",
    "we use our formalism to determine the tidal evolution time scales for an object , in an orbit of small eccentricity , around a sun - like star in which the tidal response is assumed to occur .",
    "this is taken to have a perturbing companion , either with the same mass , or with a mass typical of exoplanets .",
    "we consider the case of synchronous rotation and in addition a non rotating star when the companion is an exoplanet .",
    "we assume that wave dissipation occurs close to the stellar centre such that the moderately large dissipation regime applies .",
    "additionally , we apply the formalism to the problem of tidal excitation of normal modes after a periaston flyby showing that realistic stars having an extended convective envelope are more susceptible to the action of tides than a frequently used reference model consisting of a polytrope , with index @xmath2 and with the same mean density , see section [ s4 ] .",
    "we assume below that when the orbital motion may be considered to be periodic a discrete fourier series in time is appropriate . for a real quantity ,",
    "@xmath3 we write @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle in the spherical coordinate system @xmath8 associated with a frame rotating with the angular frequency @xmath9 with respect to an inertial frame with the rotation axis being directed along @xmath10 .",
    "the orbital frequency is @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are integers , with only positive values of @xmath12 included in the summation as in ip7 .",
    "when the orbital motion may be treated as parabolic we employ a fourier transform instead of a fourier series .",
    "the stellar perturbations are described by the lagrangian displacement vector @xmath14 .",
    "the dominant quadrupole component of the tidal potential , @xmath15 , is represented in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the spherical functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 are given in appendix a of paper 1 for the case of coplanar orbit with small eccentricity .",
    "for orbits having an arbitrary value for the eccentricity , these coefficients can be expressed in terms of so - called hansen coefficients discussed eg . in witte @xmath0 savonije ( 1999 ) .",
    "we use a parallel development formulated in terms of the fourier transform of the tidal potential in the case of parabolic orbits .      in this case",
    "the general expressions are obtained in paper 1 . the rate of transfer of energy in the rotating frame , @xmath19 , the rate of transfer of angular momentum , @xmath20 , and the rate of transfer of energy in the inertial frame , @xmath21 , read as @xmath22 here @xmath23 where @xmath24 are eigenfrequencies of normal modes with the index @xmath25 designating particular modes , and @xmath26 are their damping rates .",
    "the overlap integrals are @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 is an integro - differential operator describing the action of pressure and gravity forces on stellar perturbations . here",
    "dot and asterisk stand for the scalar product and complex conjugate , respectively .",
    "let us assume that the difference between neighboring values of eigenfrequencies is much smaller than their typical absolute values and that for a particular forcing frequency , @xmath31 the resonance condition is most closely satisfied for a particular mode with index @xmath32 ( which we recall will vary with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath33 where the offset , @xmath34 is such that @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the general expressions ( [ eq33 ] ) can be simplified .",
    "in general , their form depends significantly on two dimensionless parameters    they take an especially simple form depending on whether the parameter @xmath36 that measures the effectiveness of dissipation is large or small .",
    "as long as @xmath37 the former case corresponds to the so - called regime of moderately large dissipation , for which the decay time due to viscosity is much smaller than the time for waves to propagate across the star with their group velocity , see e.g. goodman @xmath0 dickson ( 1998 ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath38 in the latter case when viscosity is very small , and , accordingly , @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40    and @xmath41      the transfers of energy , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and angular momentum , @xmath44 , between the orbital motion and normal modes of the star during a periastron flyby on a prescribed parabolic orbit can also be expressed in terms of overlap integrals . for completeness",
    "we give expressions for these here .",
    "as mentioned above , in this case we should represent the results in terms of the fourier transform of the tidal potential instead of the fourier coefficients used in the previous sections .",
    "expressions for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of this were derived by ip7 .",
    "sign in front of the expression on the right hand side and in equation ( 28 ) the imaginary unit should be inside the summation . ] as in the case discussed above they also can be represented as sums over quantities determined by the eigenmodes , which for a given @xmath12 have eigenfrequency @xmath45 where , for convenience , @xmath12 is here suppressed as a suffix .",
    "they take the form @xmath46 note that the quantities @xmath47 entering ( [ eq37 ] ) are discussed in e.g. ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2011 ) for the general case of a parabolic orbit inclined with respect to equatorial plane of a rotating star papaloizou ( 2011 ) differ by factor of two from those given in ( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2011 ) , the summation over the azimuthal mode number is formally performed over positive and negative values of @xmath12 , while in this paper we consider only positive azimuthal mode numbers .",
    "note also that in this paper we take all quantities related to eigenmodes to be defined in the rotating frame , while in ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2011 ) the inertial frame was used . ] .",
    "in this section we present the overlap integrals for two models of sun - like stars with mass @xmath48 , model 1a and 1b having ages @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and three models of a star with mass @xmath51 with ages @xmath52 ( model 1.5a ) , @xmath53 ( model 1.5b ) and @xmath54 ( model 1.5c ) , see figs [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the stellar models were calculated by christensen - dalsgaard ( 1996 ) and roxburgh ( 2008 ) .",
    "we also consider a polytrope with index @xmath55 as a reference model , denoting it as model 1p .",
    "the overlap integrals @xmath56 are expressed in the natural units @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the stellar mass and radius , respectively , and the eigenfrequencies are expressed in terms of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gravitational constant .",
    "all stars are assumed to be non - rotating .",
    "a discussion of effects due to rotation , the calculation of overlap integrals for stars with larger masses can be found in paper 2 and the comparison of the numerical results shown here with the corresponding analytical expressions for sun - like stars can be found in paper 1 .",
    "we only mention here that the comparison shows a good agreement between the two approaches , even for fast rotators .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the sun - like models have much larger values of the overlap integrals as compared to those for the polytropic model at small eigenfrequencies , @xmath62 .",
    "as discussed in paper 1 it is due to the presence of extended convective envelopes in the solar models , which result in a power law decay of @xmath63 with @xmath62 in comparison to an exponential decay found for the polytropic model .",
    "this means that tidal interactions of sun - like stars at sufficiently low forcing frequencies are stronger than those corresponding to a polytropic star with the same mean density , see also fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] below .",
    "the @xmath63 corresponding to models with @xmath1 are smaller than those of sun - like stars .",
    "this is because the convective envelopes are much less pronounced in the models of more massive stars discussed in the text .",
    "for the shown range of eigenfrequencies , values of @xmath63 for more massive models are even smaller than those corresponding to the polytropic model with the exception of the youngest model 1.5a , which has indeed the most extended convective envelope among the models with @xmath1 discussed here .",
    "in order to illustrate applications of our formalism let use discuss two simple problems assuming that the regime of moderately large viscosity operates in the star where tides are raised . the first concerns a binary consisting of a sun - like star in a state of synchronous rotation and a point - like object of the same mass in an orbit of small eccentricity , @xmath64 .",
    "we plot the corresponding time scale for the decay of eccentricity in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the short dashed and dotted curves are for model 1b with curves of different types corresponding to different fits for the brunt - v@xmath65is@xmath65l@xmath65 frequency close to the base of convection zone while the long dashed and dot dashed curves are for model 1a .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that there is little difference between the curves corresponding to different fits .",
    "the solid line plots a minor modification of the expression of goodman @xmath0 dickson ( 1998 ) who give @xmath66 with @xmath67 in days , for a system of two tidally interacting sun - like stars of equal mass . since we assume that the tides are raised only on one component , we plot @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "our results are seen to give larger values of @xmath69 for a given @xmath70 e.g. for @xmath71 days , the results differ by a factor of five to ten .",
    "thus we have @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 from the modified goodman @xmath0 dickson ( 1998 ) expression and for our calculations corresponding to models 1b and 1a , respectively .    the second problem deals with orbital evolution of a point - like object with a mass appropriate for a massive exoplanet orbiting around a non - rotating sun - like star .",
    "the corresponding time scales of the evolution of eccentricity and semi - major axis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] , respectively .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted curves there correspond to the perturbing mass @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . as seen from these plots , dynamical tides in the regime of moderately large viscosity are potentially efficient only when orbital periods are rather small .",
    "thus , the eccentricity is damped in a time less than @xmath78 only for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "similarly the semi - major axis can decay in a time less than @xmath78 only for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "now let us consider the problem of parabolic flyby of a star around a point - like source of gravity .",
    "one can show that once the ratio of the rotational frequency to the characteristic stellar frequency , @xmath87 , is specified , the energy and angular momentum transferred , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , expressed in units of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , respectively , are functions of only one parameter ( see eg .",
    "press @xmath0 teukolsky 1977 , ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2004 , 2007 ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the periastron distance .",
    "the quantity @xmath95 is the ratio of the mean stellar density to the solar value , @xmath96 and @xmath67 is orbital period of a circular orbit which has the same value of the orbital angular momentum as the parabolic orbit under consideration , expressed in units of one day .",
    "here we consider only the case of non - rotating sun - like star referring the reader to paper 2 and ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2011 , where more general cases are discussed .    the energy transferred as a result of tidal encounter",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the realistic stellar models give much larger values of @xmath88 at sufficiently large values of @xmath97 as compared with the reference polytropic model .",
    "this effect is due to the power law dependence of the overlap integrals in the limit @xmath98 mentioned above , which is , in turn , is due to the presence of convective regions in realistic stellar models .",
    "in this contribution we present a new general approach to the problem of dynamic tides .",
    "it allows one , in principal , to calculate all quantities of interest both for a periodic orbit of any eccentricity and for a prescribed parabolic orbit .",
    "it generalizes the well known approaches of zahn and press @xmath0 teukolsky .",
    "it is shown that provided the rate of decay of free stellar oscillations due to either linear dissipation or non - linear effects , as well as the orbital parameters , are specified , all information about tidal interactions is encoded in the overlap integrals .",
    "it is stressed that when either a system is evolving in the so - called regime of moderately large viscosity or undergoes a flyby around a gravitating body , the expressions governing energy and angular momentum exchange do not depend on the quantities describing the decay of free modes .",
    "the overlap integrals are calculated numerically for a set of population i stellar models of different masses and ages , and , additionally , analytically for sun - like stars with convective envelope and radiative core .",
    "the formalism is applied to the orbital evolution of systems having periodic orbits with small eccentricity evolving in the regime of moderately large viscosity and the parabolic flyby problem . in the former case",
    ", it is shown that a hot jupiter can spiral in a host sun - like star in a time smaller than or of the order of @xmath99 when its orbital period is smaller than @xmath100 . in the latter case",
    "it is shown that , in general , stars with realistic structure have much stronger tidal response at sufficiently large values of impact parameters than the reference polytropic model provided that they have an extended convective envelope .",
    "one unresolved issue is to provide an extension of the analytic methods of calculation of the overlap integrals in the limit @xmath98 to the case of stars with convective cores and radiative exteriors .",
    "this is left for a possible future work .",
