    "heavy fermions metals ( hf ) are intermetallic compounds of certain lanthanides and actinides .",
    "they contain a lattice of @xmath3 ions , embedded in a fermi sea of conduction electrons @xmath4 .",
    "these materials exhibit very large specific heats and spin susceptibilities at low temperatures , and these characteristics are associated with high effective masses of quasi - particles , caused by the local strong coulomb interaction between the @xmath3 electrons . the periodic anderson model ( pam )",
    "is considered a fairly good description of these systems , and the relevant parameters of this model are : the hybridization @xmath5 between the localized @xmath3-electrons and the itinerant @xmath4 electrons ( associated with the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals ) , the value of the energy @xmath9 of the localized @xmath3  level , the value @xmath10 that determines the coulomb repulsion energy between the @xmath3 electrons , the dispersion relation of the @xmath4-electrons and the chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "the physics of these materials is dominated by the competition between the kondo effect , that tends to quench  the magnetic moments of the @xmath3 levels,@xcite and the rkky ( rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) interaction , that tends to introduce antiferromagnetic order in the lattice.@xcite some of these compounds develop superconducting states at low temperatures , and their nature is not yet completely understood.@xcite .    the thermodynamic properties of the pam have been recently studied employing different methods : equation of motion ( eom)@xcite and two variants of the mean field theory@xcite that respectively describe the weak coupling limit ( hartre - fock ) and the strong coupling one ( slave boson mean field theory ( sbmft)@xcite ) . an interesting result in all",
    "these works@xcite is the presence of a multiple peak structure in the temperature dependence of the specific heat . in the works that use the eom ,",
    "the first peak was associated with spin fluctuations and the second one with charge fluctuations@xcite .",
    "bernhard et.al.@xcite , defined a lattice kondo temperature @xmath12 ( we call it @xmath13 in this work ) as equal to the @xmath14 corresponding to the minimum of the temperature derivative of the average @xmath15 , that measures the transference  of electrons from the localized levels to the conduction band and vice - versa . on the other hand , peres et.al.@xcite , define a correlation temperature @xmath16 ( we call it @xmath17 in this work ) equal to the @xmath14 corresponding to the maximum of the temperature derivative of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "as they employ the sbmft the dynamical fluctuations do not appear explicitly in their green s functions ( gf ) , and they concluded that the multiple peak structure of the specific heat is only associated with band shape effects .",
    "we believe that there is no antagonism between these two explanations : the dynamical fluctuations modify the bands ( even in the sbmft through their mean field contributions to the gf ) , and it is their spectral densities near the fermi surface that determine the specific heat .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) , with the help of the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , has been recently employed to study the pam@xcite and the kondo lattice.@xcite these works establish the simultaneous existence of two scales of energy : one high temperature scale associated with conventional kondo scattering and a lower temperature scale , usually called coherence temperature , that is associated with the formation of quasi - particles with strongly enhanced effective masses.@xcite the same result has been also obtained by applying the sbmft in the large-@xmath19 approach to the kondo lattice.@xcite the notation of these temperature scales is not uniform in the literature , and we shall then use @xmath17 for the lattice coherence temperature,@xcite and introduce @xmath13 for the high temperature scale , leaving @xmath12 for the impurity kondo temperature .    in the present work we study the thermodynamic properties of the pam in the limit of @xmath20 employing the x - boson method@xcitein two regimes of the pam : the heavy fermion kondo regime ( hf - k ) and the local magnetic moment regime ( hf - lmm).@xcite the spurious second order phase transitions of the slave - boson approach,@xcite at intermediate temperatures and when @xmath21 , are not present in the x - boson method .",
    "this method also includes explicitly some temporal quantum fluctuations in the gf,@xcite and we analyze some possible consequences of this difference .",
    "we show that the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath13 are determined by the position of the maximum of @xmath22 vs. @xmath14 , and we discuss the physical origin of these maxima .",
    "we show that at low t the entropy per site tends to zero in the hf - k regime , corresponding to a singlet ground state , while it tends to @xmath1 in the hf - lmm , corresponding to a doublet ground state at each site and opening the way for the possible formation of an antiferromagnetic order ( af ) at low temperatures ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we show that when the system is in the hf - k regime and the system goes at low temperatures through the kondo resonance , there is a huge increase of the effective mass of the f electrons , associated with the linear coefficient @xmath24 of the specific heat .",
    "our calculations of @xmath25 qualitatively agree with the experimental results at low temperatures for some materials classified in the two regimes considered .",
    "to study the pam hamiltonian in the @xmath0 limit , the f - levels with double occupation are projected out from the space of the local states by employing the hubbard @xmath26 operators,@xcite and we obtain @xmath27 the first term of the equation represents the hamiltonian of the conduction electrons ( @xmath4-electrons ) , associated with the itinerant electrons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals ) .",
    "the second term describes the localized @xmath3 levels and the last one corresponds to the interaction between the @xmath4-electrons and the @xmath3-electrons via hybridization between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .",
    "this hamiltonian can be treated by the x - boson approach@xcite for the lattice case , and the cumulant green s function ( gf ) are then given by @xmath28@xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .",
    "the correlations appear in the chain x - boson approach through the quantity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",

    "a renormalized @xmath35 also appears here in the x - boson method , with @xmath36 given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath39 is the number of sites . to simplify the calculations we shall consider a rectangular conduction band of width @xmath40 , centered at the origin , and a real hybridization constant @xmath41",

    "the temperature @xmath13 corresponds to the second energy scale in both dmft works,@xcite and its corresponding energy is related to the transitions between the states of the pseudo gap that usually appears in that treatment .",

    "we must also consider that we have not included explicit magnetic interactions into the hamiltonian , and also that there is no rkky interaction because only second order cumulants are employed in the basic cha expansion , as shown by the corresponding diagrams ( see e.g. fig . 1 or reference ) .",
    "the absence of fourth and higher order cumulants in the cha leads to a disturbing question : how do we obtain any kondo resonance at all in the hf - k region , if apparently there are no spin flip processes in our calculation ? to answer this question we notice that although the x - boson method starts from an expansion without spin flips , it is followed by a minimization of the free energy with respect to @xmath149 , with the completeness as a subsidiary condition ( cf .",

    "we should point out that the same type of arguments presented here would also apply to the sbmft , because after making the mean field approximation of the slave boson operator , one is left with two hybridized bands without any explicit correlation , and it is again the free energy restrained minimization that leads to the formation of a resonance that describes the kondo peak .",
