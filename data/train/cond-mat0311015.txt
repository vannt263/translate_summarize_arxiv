    "broad interest in surface growth problems and the interface motion stems from many applications that these problems have in practically all sciences .",
    "some well - known examples are crystallization problems , epitaxial growth , wetting phenomena , electrophoretic deposition of polymer chains , and growth of bacterial colonies .",
    "the mainstream studies of physical mechanisms that lead to growth and roughening , and interface properties , focus on the so - called universal properties , i.e. , large - scale properties of growing surfaces as determined by universal scaling exponents .",
    "a central point here is a coarse - grained description of the interface , which leads to an effective growth equation , typical for a universality class .",
    "it is safe to say that universal properties of time - evolving surfaces are well understood @xcite .",
    "there are many situations , however , where _ non - universal _ properties , i.e. , those pertaining to the microscopic structure of the interface , are of importance in understanding the physical system .",
    "one case is the density of local minima of a virtual - time interface , evolving in parallel discrete - event simulations @xcite .",
    "another case is the movement of random walkers on a growing surface @xcite .",
    "another case is the density of maxima after solidification and processing of a surface , where this density is related to the frictional force @xcite . even for a one - dimensional interface , as in the growth of a two - dimensional crystal @xcite ,",
    "a general description of the microscopic structure is challenging , both for analytics and for simulations , due to a variety of length and time scales .",
    "however , for a strongly non - equilibrium interface ( e.g. , in a cold system ) a net picture of the interface gains and losses can be simplified .",
    "this leads to a variety of simulation models such as , e.g. , ballistic deposition , eden or solid - on - solid models .    here",
    "we introduce a discrete - event analytic technique that provides a means for calculating some non - universal properties of interfaces .",
    "the key idea is the construction of a probability distribution for events that take place on the surface .",
    "this new approach gives a mean - field like approximation of averages that are determined in simulations . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we explain the main concept by examples of applications to selected non - equilibrium one - dimensional model interfaces .",
    "the method is summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we focus on a model in which a one dimensional ( _ 1d _ ) surface grows by the deposition of local height increments @xmath0 at @xmath1 lattice sites , with periodic boundary condition @xmath2 ( @xmath3 enumerates the lattice sites , @xmath4 is the local height ) .",
    "the deposited @xmath0 is a real positive number that can take on continuous values in the interval @xmath5 .",
    "our discussion is not specific to the probability distribution from which @xmath0 is sampled .",
    "we consider a rough surface at saturation ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . such a surface can be generated , e.g. , in the single - step solid - on - solid models @xcite or in random deposition with surface relaxation @xcite or by depositing random @xmath0 at local surface minimum @xcite .     a typical model surface in _ 1d _ , @xmath6.,width=264 ]    in the latter case",
    ", the growth is simulated by the nearest - neighbor rule : @xmath7 , if @xmath8 ; otherwise , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the time index )",
    ". the above deposition rule produces surfaces characterized by the universal roughness exponent @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "our objective is to show that it is possible to construct a theoretical probability distribution of deposition events on the surface generated by the above rule .",
    "this distribution can then be used to compute measurable quantities at saturation , e.g. , the mean density of local minima or maxima . also , it can serve as the departure point for the construction of other distributions that describe more complex growth processes .",
    "our derivation makes the following two simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we neglect correlations between nearest - neighbor local slopes , which depend on the type of deposition , i.e. , the distribution from which @xmath0 is sampled .",
    "second , we neglect temporal correlations among the groups of the surface configuration classes , as explained later . because of the above simplifications , our theoretical results for the averages are a mean - field like approximation to the averages measured in simulations .",
    "the four groups of elementary local surface configurations at the @xmath3-th site . in accordance with the adopted growth rule , local a - configuration represents four types of discrete deposition events , and local configuration b ( or c ) represents two types of events.,width=283 ]    the adopted growth rule provides the principle for the classification of local lattice - site configurations of the interface .",
    "there are only four groups of these configurations ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "each group corresponds to one of the four mutually exclusive discrete events a , b , c and d that take place at site @xmath3 during the deposition attempt at @xmath10 :  a \" denotes an event when the deposition rule is satisfied from both sides , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ;  b \" denotes an event when the rule is not satisfied from the right ;  c \" denotes an event when the rule is not satisfied from the left ;  d \" denotes an event when the rule is not satisfied from either side .",
    "the above events can be mapped in unique way onto elementary local site configurations a , b , c and d , presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . for a closed chain of sites ,",
    "the set of events when all sites are simultaneously in the a - configuration is of measure zero , and not all @xmath1 sites can have the same elementary configuration .",
    "therefore , in the set of @xmath1 sites there must be at least one site with configuration a. we assign the index @xmath14 to one of the sites in the a - configuration and enumerate the other sites accordingly , progressing to the right .",
    "its right neighbor ( site @xmath15 ) can be only either in configuration c or d. similarly , its left neighbor ( site @xmath16 ) can be only either in b or d. if site @xmath15 is in c then site @xmath17 can be only either in c or d. if site @xmath15 is in d then site @xmath17 can be only either in b or a. if site @xmath17 is in b then its right neighbor can be either in b or a , etc . starting from the site @xmath14 and progressing to the right towards @xmath16 , applying these elementary neighbor rules , we can construct all possible configuration equivalency classes of the entire surface generated by the adopted growth rule .",
    "these can be categorized into groups ( called @xmath18-groups ) , based on the number @xmath18 of the deposition events on the surface at @xmath10 , i.e. , here , the number of local minima in the surface configuration ( coded by ",

    "negligible variations between the derived analytical probability distribution and simulated distributions with gaussian , poissonian and uniform increments demonstrate that the theoretical distribution presents well the statistics of events on the surface .",
