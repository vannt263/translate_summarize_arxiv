    "<S> we investigate the currently debated issue concerning whether transition metal substitutions dope carriers in iron based superconductors . from first - principles calculations of the configuration - averaged spectral function of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with disordered co </S>",
    "<S> / zn substitutions of fe , important doping effects are found beyond merely changing the carrier density . while the chemical potential shifts suggest doping of a large amount of carriers , a reduction of the coherent carrier density is found due to the loss of spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , none of the change in the fermi surface , density of states , or charge distribution can be solely used for counting doped coherent carriers , let alone presenting the full effects of the disordered substitutions . </S>",
    "<S> our study highlights the necessity of including disorder effects in the studies of doped materials in general .    </S>",
    "<S> utf8bsmi    doping is one of the most powerful tools for tuning the electronic properties of functional materials . </S>",
    "<S> well known examples include n- and p - type semi - conductors , dilute magnetic semi - conductors and numerous heavy fermions and strongly correlated oxides ( e.g. manganites , cobaltates , and cuprates . ) in most of these cases , inclusion of doped impurities are considered an effective way to introduce carriers , but recently the amount of carrier doping has become the center of a serious debate in the field of iron based superconductors ( fescs ) . a density functional theory ( dft ) study  @xcite reported that the additional charge density in transition metal ( tm ) substituted fescs are fully localized at the tm dopant site , which lead  @xcite to the surprising conclusion that the tm substitutions do not dope carriers . while the lack of additional density at the fe sites has recently been confirmed experimentally  @xcite , this widely discussed conclusion of the system being undoped , however , seems to be in contradiction with several experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies that indicate a change of fermi surfaces ( fss ) consistent with carrier doping . </S>",
    "<S> a serious debate was thus initiated in the field : do the tm substitutions dope carriers into the fescs or not ?    in this letter we investigate this issue via first - principles dft calculation of _ disordered _ substitutions . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the previous theoretical studies , which employed rather small periodic super cells , we compute the configuration - averaged spectral function of disordered tm substitutions in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , using the weak co and strong zn impurities as representative examples . in the case of co substitution , despite the localized charge distribution , no apparent localized states are found and a large chemical potential shift results from the injection of additional carriers to the system . in the case of zn substitution , while both strongly and weakly localized states are found , the chemical potential is still shifted noticeably , reflecting real carrier doping to the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , an important loss of coherent spectral weight results from scattering against the disordered impurities . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the actual number of coherent carriers in the system reduces noticeably from the luttinger count of the fss . </S>",
    "<S> our findings illustrate that none of the fss , density of states , or the charge density can be used for a physically meaningful counting of coherent carriers in a disordered system in general . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , physical effects of the disordered impurities are much richer than simply adding carriers . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the emergence of incoherent carriers and loss of coherent carriers holds interesting potentials to strengthen superconductivity over magnetism , and should be taken into account in future studies .    </S>",
    "<S> the configuration - averaged wannier based spectral function @xmath1 of wannier orbital @xmath2 , frequency @xmath3 , and crystal momentum @xmath4 ( in the 2-fe brillouin zone  @xcite ) is obtained by averaging over 10 large random - shaped supercells containing 400 atoms on average , including 12.5% random tm substitutions ( e.g. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the spectral functions at fixed k - points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c)-(f ) and  [ fig : fig3](b)(c ) 100 supercells of 800 atoms on average are used ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral functions are calculated directly from the supercell eigenvalues and eigenvectors , by applying the recently developed unfolding method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first principles simulations of the large supercells , necessary for a proper treatment of disorder , are made affordable by the recently developed wannier function  @xcite based effective hamiltonian method for disordered systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the tm substitutions on the hamiltonian is extracted from three dft  @xcite calculations : the undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and the impurity supercells ba@xmath0fe@xmath5coas@xmath6 and ba@xmath7fe@xmath8znas@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy hilbert space is taken within [ -10,3 ] ev consisting of wannier orbitals of fe-@xmath10 , co-@xmath10/zn-@xmath10 , and as-@xmath11 characters . </S>",

    "<S> let us first re - examine the previously reported charge localization  @xcite and chemical potential shift  @xcite within our disordered co substitution case . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) shows the average occupation of each atom calculated from frequency / momentum integration and orbital summation of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the occupations in the doped system with that in the undoped system shows that , in agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the additional charge is indeed distributed at the co impurity , seemingly implying that co does not dope carriers . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> compared with the fss of the undoped ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](c ) ) system , the doped system ( fig .  [ fig : fig1](d ) ) contains smaller / larger hole / electron pockets around the @xmath15/x point , in agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical findings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the fss of the doped system are found to be consistent with the undoped system upon adding the nominal doping of + 0.125 electrons per fe ( the dotted line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](d ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> the same can also be observed from the band structure in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , our results of disordered co substitutions confirm both the localized distribution of additional charge  @xcite and the chemical potential shift  @xcite , which still leaves us with the question : do tm substitutions dope carriers or not ?     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) configuration averaged spectral function of disordered ba(fe@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath0as@xmath14 in the full low energy hilbert space ( a ) where the partial dos of co is enhanced by a factor of 7.(b ) comparison of spectral function and dos of disordered system ( black ) with the undoped one ( grey ) near the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> bloch based spectral function of band @xmath16 at ( c ) @xmath17 m and ( d ) @xmath18 m and of bands @xmath19 at ( e ) @xmath20 and ( f ) @xmath21 m , where the dashed / solid lines indicate the centers of the dispersive / non - dispersive components . the black curves in ( c)(d)(e)(f ) correspond to the total spectral function . ]    to reconcile these seemingly contradicting results , a notion of impurity potential  @xcite ( or self - energy  @xcite ) induced``effective doping '' was previously proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results give a different physical explanation and show that such notion is not only unnecessary but also negligible in effect for the case of co substitution . </S>",
    "<S> let s focus on the ( @xmath4,@xmath3)-dependence of @xmath1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] . notice first that while the band dispersion resembles well the undoped system , important effects of disorder scattering can be observed . for example , the fe-@xmath10 bands ( even at the chemical potential ) develop line widths in both momentum and frequency , reflecting their finite mean free path and lifetime from scattering against co impurities . also notice that besides these features , no apparent localized state ( flat band ) is found in fig  [ fig : fig2 ] to host one electron per co. therefore , the localized distribution of additional charge must originate from _ slight _ enhancement of the wave function near the co sites in _ a large number _ of extended occupied states , instead of a small number of strongly localized or resonant states ! </S>",
    "<S> this deduction is further supported by the dos in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) , in which the _ broad _ co spectral weight ( @xmath22 for better comparison ) is shown to be transferred to slightly lower energy , in relation to the fe spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> that is , contrary to the previous interpretations  @xcite our result shows that practically no carriers are `` trapped '' around co , but instead a large number of itinerant carriers conspire to enhance the charge distribution around co in order to screen the additional proton . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the notion of `` effective doping '' is unnecessary in this case , and in fact negligible in effect . </S>",
    "<S> since the change of the wave functions and the band dispersion are rather small in this simplest case , from any physically meaningful consideration concerning doping , co substitution really just adds about one more itinerant electron per co to the system .    however , these itinerant carriers are not all the same in nature , as some of these carriers lose their coherence due to scattering against disordered impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a well - defined dispersion indicates diffusive propagation of these incoherent carriers , in contrast to the particle - like propagation of the coherent carriers . </S>",
    "<S> a clear example of non - dispersive spectral weight can be found in band 12 around @xmath20 . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c)(d ) , the band consists of two components : a peak ( dashed line ) that disperses from 0.6 to 0.7ev along @xmath15 m and a non - dispersive satellite ( solid line ) that remains fixed a little above 0.8ev . </S>",
    "<S> other incoherent features are more difficult to recognize due to the presence of multiple bands in the same frequency range . to resolve the different bands , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c)-(f ) and  [ fig : fig3](b)(c ) , we analyze the spectral function @xmath23 on the basis of the undoped bloch states @xmath24 of crystal momentum @xmath4 and band index @xmath25  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](e)(f ) an incoherent component in the hole pocket is illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> while along @xmath15 m the main peak in band 11 disperses from 0.1 to -0.3ev , the satellite around -0.6ev remains fixed . </S>",
    "<S> note also that while nearby in frequency , the non - dispersive satellite of band 11 is not part of the dispersing band 8 . due to the proximity of the incoherent features to the main peaks , an unambiguous quantification of the obviously reduced coherent spectral weight is challenging in this case .    from the perspective of disordered impurities , </S>",
    "<S> co substitution of fe introduces only a weak impurity potential @xmath26 - 0.5ev to the d - orbitals , much smaller than the bandwidth of the @xmath10-bands , and thus can be considered as a small perturbation to the system . </S>",
    "<S> this is ultimately the reason why the fermi surfaces resemble very much the undoped system added with nominal doping of + 0.125 electrons per fe ( e.g. fig.1(d ) ) , even though luttinger theorem should not apply to disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is instructive to explore the zn substitution of fe , which represents the other limit with very strong impurity potential ( @xmath26 - 7ev ) much larger than the bandwidth of the @xmath10-bands .     </S>",

    "<S> ( f ) the estimated number of doped coherent carriers . the black curves in ( b)(c ) correspond to the total spectral function . ]    as expected , the strong impurity potential of zn substitution is able to induce real localization , in great contrast to the co substitution . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) shows our resulting band structure of zn substituted system with flat core levels of zn-@xmath10 character , which are good examples of strongly localized states created by the large impurity potential . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , weakly localized as - states can also be observed clearly within [ -6,-5 ] ev , right below the as-@xmath11 bands  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small region of @xmath4-space in which these weakly localized states reside reflects their large size compared to the 2-fe unit cell ( similar to the oxygen vacancy states in zno  @xcite ) .    due to the very strong impurity potential </S>",
    "<S> , the influence of the impurity can no longer be considered as a small perturbation , and consequently the counting of the carriers would become non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the broadening of the fe-@xmath10 spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b ) is significantly stronger than the previous case , indicating a much shorter lifetime and mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even as-@xmath11 bands scatter strongly in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , from a comparison of the valence of fe@xmath30 and zn@xmath30 , one could have expected that zn substitutions do not dope carriers to the system . </S>",
    "<S> this is obviously not the case , since the chemical potential has been shifted so much that the hole carriers are almost entirely removed from the system . </S>",
    "<S> the new fss in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](d ) appear to have been doped with @xmath31 electrons per fe , a number that can not be easily rationalized from simple counting of valence , in great contrast to the case of co substitution . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates clearly the general inapplicability of luttinger theorem to disordered systems .    of course , the physically meaningful count should distinguish the coherent carriers from the incoherent features </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we analyze the components of the bloch based spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> two examples are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b)(c ) , representing the bands in the hole and electron pockets respectively . </S>",
    "<S> an integration of the bloch based spectral function within [ -1,1]ev gives an estimated coherence factor of @xmath260.85 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an effective doping of @xmath26 + 0.049 / @xmath26 - 0.126 per fe in the electron / hole pockets ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig3](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a simple luttinger count would lead to a large overestimation of 73% of the number of doped electron carriers .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the co / zn substitutions are more efficient in removing the coherent hole carriers than adding the electron ones , an effect relevant to the doping dependence of hall coefficient  @xcite . of the @xmath32 spectral weight loss with zn substitutions , @xmath33 comes from the trivial strongly localized zn d - orbitals , while the remaining @xmath34 corresponds to the decoherence of fe bands . </S>",
    "<S> ( similar spectral weight losses can be expected in the case of fe vacancies . ) finally , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](e ) shows an enhanced dos upon substitution , even though the coherent fraction of dos actually decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite alarming , considering that dos is routinely used in the standard studies of doped materials , but actually provides no distinguishability of coherent features from the incoherent ones .    </S>",
    "<S> the above disorder effects have important physical implications that immediately impact on experimental and theoretical studies of fescs . at the simplest level , </S>",
    "<S> one expects a doping dependence of the broadening of the bands , as found in the raw arpes data  @xcite , and contribution to the incoherent features in other spectroscopies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , deeper issues are present . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated above , other than the appearance of incoherent features , the chemical potential and the associated phase space of coherent carriers are no longer related to the coherent carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have found the fermi velocities of the electron / hole carriers to resemble those of a highly doped system , but instead with a much smaller coherent carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> this can not be possibly described with merely adding carriers to the undoped system , and is in contradiction with the textbook theories , based on which most experiments are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in optical conductivity and dielectric function , one might now find a spectral line shape similar to that of an undoped system with additional electrons ( since its band dispersion resembles the real disordered system ) , but with a overall reduction in the intensity ( due to the weight loss of coherent carriers ) as dictated by various sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the same consideration should apply to transport and other spectroscopies as well , since they are all sensitive to both the phase space controlled by the band structure and the spectral weight related to the coherent carrier density .    </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , besides the impurities standard role of suppressing @xmath35 via scattering  @xcite , the emergence of incoherent carriers and the lost of coherent spectral weight can also affect the competition between magnetic and superconducting instabilities in the underdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> both effects serve to suppress long - range antiferromagnetic order , allowing a stronger superconductivity to develop . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the the nesting condition is reduced by the loss of coherent spectral weight , while the ill - defined momentum of the incoherent carriers give negligible contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this explains , at least in part , why both electron doping and hole doping both suppress the antiferromagnetic order , despite the degree of nesting condition . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the zero momentum superconductivity still benefit from all the incoherent carriers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the slow propagation of the incoherent carriers makes them more susceptible to the strong coupling regime of superconductivity  @xcite that hosts stronger local pairing but weaker phase coherence . </S>",
    "<S> ( this might offer a resolution to the current issue of power law behavior of the penetration depth  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> coupled to the lighter coherent carriers , this can actually help enhance the superconductivity by providing a stronger local pairing . </S>",
    "<S> such opposite effects on the magnetism and superconductivity have in fact been observed recently in zn substitution of f - underdoped laofeas  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the loss of coherent spectral weight would allow practically the current itinerant pairing theories  @xcite to incorporate stronger interaction parameters without triggering a long - range magnetic order , and thereby to further enhance the superconducting instability .    in conclusion , by computing the configurational - averaged spectral </S>",
    "<S> function of disordered co / zn substituted bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , we identify important physical effects of tm substitution that can not be captured by merely adding carriers to the undoped systems . </S>",
    "<S> while both strongly and weakly localized states are found via zn substitution , no apparent localization is found via co substitution , despite the localized distribution of additional charge . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the fss and fermi velocities are modified as a consequence of chemical potential shift , reflecting injection of doped carriers . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> some incoherent carriers emerge , in association with a loss of the coherent spectral weight that reduces considerably the actual number of coherent carriers . </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate clearly that generally in disordered systems , none of the fss , dos , or the charge distribution can be solely used for the counting of coherent carriers . </S>",
    "<S> physically , our reported features would produce unusual behaviors in various spectroscopies and other physical properties beyond the standard textbook descriptions , and thus needs to be taken into account in future experimental and theoretical studies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they offer new possibilities to tip the balance from magnetism toward superconductivity , an important aspect that deserves to be considered in future studies of superconductivity in general .    </S>",
