    "two - way relaying ( twr ) @xcite has been the focus of considerable research interest in recent years due to its potential in offering higher information exchange throughput for cognitive communications such as device - to - device ( d2d ) and machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications @xcite . unlike the conventional one - way relaying , which needs four time slots for information exchange between a pair of users ( ues )",
    ", twr needs just two time slots for this exchange @xcite . in the first time slot , known as the multiple access ( mac ) phase , all ues simultaneously transmit their signals to the relays . in the second time slot ,",
    "also known as the broadcast ( bc ) phase , the relays broadcast the beamformed signals to the all ues .",
    "offering double fast communication , twr obviously suffers from double multi - channel interference as compared to one - way relaying @xcite .",
    "both optimal control of ues transmit power and twr beamforming are thus very important in exploring the spectral efficiency of twr .",
    "there are various scenarios of twr considered in the literature .",
    "the most popular scenario is single - antenna relays serving a pair of single - antenna ues @xcite .",
    "the typical problems are to design the twr weights to either maximize the throughput or minimize the relay power subject to signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraints at ues .",
    "a branch - and - bound ( bb ) algorithm of global optimization @xcite was used in @xcite for sum throughput maximization .",
    "its computational complexity is already very high in very low - dimensional problems .",
    "semi - definite relaxation of high computational complexity followed by bisection used in @xcite works strictly under a single total relay power constraint .",
    "furthermore , the scenario of single - antenna relays serving multiple pairs of ues was addressed in @xcite by a polyblock algorithm of global optimization @xcite and in @xcite by local linearization based iteration .",
    "the mentioned semi - definite relaxation was also used in @xcite in designing twr beamformer for the scenario of a multi - antenna relay serving multiple pairs of ues .",
    "it should be realized that most of relay beamformer optimization problems considered in all these works are not more difficult computationally than their one - way relaying counterparts , which have been efficiently solved in @xcite .    the fixed power allocation to ues",
    "does not only miss the opportunity of power distribution within a network but can also potentially increase interference to ues of other networks @xcite .",
    "the joint design of ue power allocation and twr weights for single antenna relays serving a pair of single antenna ues to maximize the minimum sinr was considered in @xcite . under the strict assumption that the complex channel gains from ues to the relays are the same as those from the relays to the ues , its design is divided into two steps .",
    "the first step is to optimize the beamformer weights with ues fixed power by sequential second - order convex cone programming ( socp ) .",
    "the second step performs an exhaustive grid search for ue power allocation .",
    "joint optimization of ue precoding and relay beamforming for a multi - antenna relay serving a pair of multi - antenna ues could be successfully addressed only recently in @xcite .",
    "an efficient computation for joint ue power allocation and twr beamforming to maximize the worst ue throughput for multiple antenna relays serving multiple pairs of single antenna ues was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite for joint ue and relay power allocation in mimo ofdm system of one relay and one pair of ues .",
    "meanwhile , the aforementioned classical spectral efficiency ( se ) in terms of high throughput is now only one among multiple driving forces for the development of the next generation communication networks ( 5 g ) @xcite .",
    "the energy consumption of communication systems has become sizable , raising environmental and economic concerns @xcite .",
    "particularly , the network energy efficiency ( ee ) in terms of the ratio of the sum throughput and the total power consumption , which counts not only the transmission power but also the drain efficiency of power amplifiers , circuit power and other power factors in supporting the network s activities , is comprehensively pushed forward in 5 g to address these concerns @xcite .",
    "ee in single - antenna twr has been considered in @xcite for single - antenna ofdma in assisting multiple pairs of single - antenna ues and in @xcite and @xcite for multi - antenna relays in assisting a pair of multi - antenna ues .",
    "again , the main tool for computational solution in these works is semi - definite relaxation , which not only significantly increases the problem dimension but also performs unpredictably @xcite .",
    "also , the resultant dinkelbach s iteration of fractional programming invokes a logarithmic function optimization , which is convex but still computationally difficult with no available algorithm of polynomial complexity .",
    "the above analysis of the state - of - the - art twr motivates us to consider the joint design of single - antenna ue power allocation and twr beamformers in a twr network to maximize its ee subject to ue qos constraints .",
    "we emphasize that both sum throughput maximization ( for spectral efficiency ) and ee maximization are meaningful only in the context of ue qos satisfaction , without which they will cause the ue service discrimination .",
    "unfortunately , to our best knowledge such ue qos constraints were not addressed whenever they are nonconvex @xcite .",
    "the nonconvexity of these qos constraints implies that even finding their feasible points is already computationally difficult .",
    "qos constraints in terms of ues exchange throughput requirements are much more difficult than that in terms of individual ue throughput requirements because the former can not be expressed in terms of individual sinr constraints as the latter . to address the ee maximization problem , we first develop a new computational method for ue exchange throughput requirement feasibility , which invokes only simple convex quadratic optimization . a new path - following computational procedure for computational solutions of the ee maximization problem",
    "is then proposed .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] formulates two optimization problems of ee maximization and ue qos optimization .",
    "two path - following algorithms are developed in section [ sec : qos ] and [ sec : ee ] for their computation .",
    "in contrast to fractional programming , these algorithms invoke only a simple convex quadratic optimization of low computational complexity at each iteration .",
