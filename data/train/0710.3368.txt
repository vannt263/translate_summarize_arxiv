    "thermodynamics provides a theoretical framework for describing the macroscopic properties of equilibrium systems which are largely independent of microscopic details .",
    "much research in recent years has searched for universal features in non - equilibrium systems to help develop macroscopic theories of non - equilibrium statistical physics that are similarly insensitive to microscopic details . one important branch of this research has focused on the gallavotti ",
    "cohen fluctuation theorem  @xcite and related results  @xcite which are collectively referred to as fluctuation relations .",
    "a fluctuation relation ( fr ) is formulated for the pdf of some quantity , @xmath0 , derived from the entropy production or energy dissipation in a system driven far from equilibrium .",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by averaging a physical quantity , @xmath1 , typically the entropy produced or energy dissipated along a phase space trajectory of the system , over a time interval @xmath2 $ ] : @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath0 is positive on average but , may fluctuate sufficiently about its mean that negative fluctuations are observable .",
    "an fr quantifies the relative probability of observing a negative fluctuation over a given time interval compared to the probability of observing a positive fluctuation of the same magnitude .",
    "the ratio of probabilities takes the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant , independent of the averaging interval , @xmath6 . in the original formulation of  @xcite",
    ", @xmath1 is the entropy produced along a trajectory in phase space of a microscopically reversible chaotic system satisfying a criterion called the `` chaotic hypothesis '' . in @xcite , eq.([eq - generalfr ] ) is a theorem in which @xmath7 and there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "attempts to probe the validity of these hypotheses by experiments and numerical simulations have struggled with the fact that it is difficult to find systems for which the assumptions of the theorem , are under control .",
    "see @xcite for one such experimental test and further discussion .",
    "notwithstanding this difficulty , several experimental and numerical studies have studied the analogue of eq.([eq - generalfr ] ) in situations where the result may not be expected to hold a - priori .",
    "see  @xcite and the references therein . despite the fact that , in almost all cases , these systems were dissipative and follow microscopically irreversible dynamics ,",
    "they have succeeded in yielding an empirical fr . here ,",
    "empirical means that the parameter @xmath5 , which is typically not 1 , can not be deduced a - priori from known properties of the system ( with the possible exception of the granular experiment discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "not all of these experiments have provided equally good tests of the fr . in some experiments the fluctuations were gaussian , in which case eq.([eq - generalfr ] )",
    "is immediately upheld . while it may not be trivial to prove rigorously the gaussianity of fluctuations in an interacting system , eq.([eq - generalfr ] )",
    "is considered to be most interesting when the pdf of @xmath0 is non - gaussian .",
    "other experiments could not access sufficiently large negative fluctuations to provide a statistically convincing test .",
    "efforts are ongoing to try to find good systems on which to explore the seeming ubiquity of the fr .    from the theoretical perspective",
    ", it has been pointed out that any langevin system exhibits a fluctuation relation for a properly defined entropy production  @xcite ( although such a definition need not be unique ) . while one could argue that some of the aforementioned experiments could be sensibly modeled by langevin dynamics , most of them measure work or power rather than entropy production and the relation between the two is not always obvious .",
    "indeed it has been shown analytically  @xcite that power injection fluctuations in driven langevin systems generally do not exhibit a fluctuation relation .",
    "it has also been suggested  @xcite that the fr follows as a property of large deviations having generic kramer functions , that is , those which are differentiable near zero .    in this letter , we contribute to this ongoing discussion in two ways .",
    "firstly , we present results for a new system which exhibits an empirical fr - local power fluctuations in turbulence .",
    "while it may not help much to simply add another system to the list discussed above , we argue that this system offers considerable advantages as a model system compared with some of the others .",
    "it is easy to realise experimentally and numerically , has strongly non - gaussian fluctuations and exhibits abundant negative fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we deduce an expression for the entropy production rate from known properties of the power distribution that agrees very well with the empirical results .",
    "secondly , we provide an analytic model of the pdf of the power fluctuations themselves ( before time averaging ) based on the pdf products of normal variables .",
    "this pdf and its asymptotic properties match very well with our empirical pdfs and will find many applications beyond the present study .",
    "it is worth remembering amid the current flurry of interest in frs , that the pdf of the injected power itself is probably of more direct physical and practical interest than the pdf of its time - averaged counterpart . on this basis , the results we present on the structure of the power pdf itself are of more general interest , beyond the topic of frs .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first provide a brief discussion of two - dimensional turbulence and explain the power measurements in the eulerian and lagrangian frames .",
    "we then describe the structure and asymptotics of the pdfs of the power and compare with the empirical pdfs obtained from our data .",
    "finally we present data demonstrating an empirical fr and explain the original of the value obtained for @xmath5 .",
    "the considerable differences between the physics of turbulence in 2d compared to 3d can be traced to the existence of an additional inviscid invariant ( in addition to the kinetic energy ) , known as enstrophy . as a result of the dual conservation of energy and enstrophy in 2d , there are two distinct scaling regimes in 2d turbulence in the inviscid limit . if energy and enstrophy are injected into the flow at a given scale , @xmath8 , the enstrophy tends to be transferred to scales smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "this process is refered to as a direct cascade .",
    "the energy , on the other hand , tends to be transferred to scales larger than @xmath8 .",
    "this phenomenon , referred to as an inverse cascade is specific to 2d .",
    "according to the classical theory of kraichnan  @xcite , the energy spectrum in the direct cascade regime scales as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the modulus of the fourier space wave - vector whereas the energy spectrum in the inverse cascade regime scales as @xmath11 . for detailed review of the theory and phenomenology of 2d turbulence",
    "see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "although we have studied the statistics of the energy injection rate in both the direct and inverse cascade regimes , in this letter we primarily discuss results for the inverse cascade regime .",
    "the analysis performed for the direct cascade regime was observed to be essentially similar to the inverse cascade results .",
    "the only related study which we are aware of is  @xcite where the statistics of the global ( i.e. averaged over the entire system ) power have been studied experimentally in 3d . here , we study the local power in 2d as we now explain.the instantaneous rate of energy input at a point , @xmath12 in the fluid is given by the scalar product of the instantaneous fluid velocity at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the instantaneous body force , @xmath14 , acting on the fluid at @xmath12 . to construct the pdf of @xmath15",
    "there are two approaches .",
    "one can fix the time and measure the @xmath16 and @xmath17 at different points and construct the pdf over the values of the local power at different spatial points .",
    "this is called an eulerian measurement .",
    "alternatively we may follow the trajectory , @xmath18 , of a particular fluid element as it is advected by the turbulence and measure the force , @xmath19 , velocity , @xmath20 and power @xmath21 experienced by this element .",
    "we then construct the pdf over the values of the power at different times .",
    "this is called a lagrangian measurement .",
    "we have measured the power distribution in both the eulerian and lagrangian frames but focus more on the latter .",
    "the variance of the velocity is slighly larger in the lagrangian frame but once this has been taken into account , the power statistics look very similar for both cases . for a careful discussion of the similarities and differences between the eulerian and lagrangian frames in 2d turbulence see @xcite .",

    "we simulated a biperiodic domain of size @xmath22 .",
    "for details of the simulations see  @xcite . aside from the issue of experimental relevance ,",
    "the reason to choose the electromagnetic forcing protocol over the stochastic forcing protocols traditional for numerical simulations of turbulence is that we do not wish to introduce an additional stochasticity into the system .",
    "all of the power fluctuations should come from the intrinsic stochasticity of the flow . to generate a direct cascade",
    ", we forced at large scales using a distorted magnetic field perpendicular to the layer with characteristic wave number 5 . to generate an inverse cascade , we forced at smaller scales with a magnetic field having characteristic wavenumber 35 . for further details of the turbulence diagnostics and spectra",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the fluid was driven with a direct current in the @xmath23-direction .",
    "the only component of the force is then in the @xmath24 direction so that @xmath25 is just given by a simple product of y - components of force and velocity rather than a scalar product .",
    "results for alternating current are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one should appreciate that although the forcing is deterministic ( the disorder of the underlying magnetic field is quenched ) , in the lagrangian frame , it is sampled by a random trajectory so that the force acting on a lagrangian particle is effectively stochastic .",
