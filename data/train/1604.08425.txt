    "the ubiquitous nature of iron in silicon feedstock , in the si melt and in as - grown si crystals , combined with its high diffusivity and its strong carrier recombination power ( particularly in p - type si ) , make fe one of the most feared contaminants in electronic- and solar - grade silicon .",
    "in fact , the concentration of atomically dispersed fe in solar - si must be kept below a tolerance threshold of only @xmath0  @xmath1 to ensure minority carrier lifetimes @xmath2s.@xcite this is achieved by _ storing _ fe impurities away from active regions in the form of less harmful precipitates with up to several @xmath3 m in diameter , which in turn poses the latent threat of particle dissolution.@xcite for further details on the subject of iron in silicon the reader is directed to the seminal reviews of istratov , hieslmair and weber.@xcite    when dissolved in a si crystal , fe atoms occur mostly as interstitial impurities ( @xmath4 ) occupying tetrahedral interstitial sites .",
    "this defect is relatively well understood , and spectroscopic signals obtained through electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) , electron - nuclear double resonance,@xcite deep - level transient spectroscopy ( dlts),@xcite emission channeling,@xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy ( ms)@xcite have been reported extensively .",
    "interstitial fe in si becomes mobile above room - temperature . in p - type material",
    "it diffuses as a positively charged ion , being readily trapped by negatively charged acceptors to form fe - acceptor pairs.@xcite two types of iron - acceptor pairs have been reported , namely one with trigonal symmetry and another with orthorhombic symmetry , corresponding to stable and metastable configurations , respectively.@xcite based on the fully reversible @xmath5 reaction , zoth and bergholz@xcite proposed a method to quickly estimate the total concentration of fe@xmath6 in si samples with a sensitivity of @xmath7  @xmath1 , conferring significant technological relevance to fe - acceptor pairs .    while it is consensual that iron impurities occupy interstitial sites under equilibrium conditions , there is convincing evidence for the existence of substantial concentrations of substitutional fe ( fe@xmath8 ) provided by emission channeling@xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy.@xcite however , and despite many attempts , powerful techniques like epr or dlts",
    "have not detected a signal that can be unambiguously assigned to fe@xmath8 .",
    "this is rather puzzling , as theory predicts fe@xmath8 to be a paramagnetic deep acceptor in the negative charge state.@xcite since channeling measurements invariably involve implantation of radioactive probe ions ( followed by thermal anneals ) , it seems clear that the presence of fe@xmath8 could result from the interaction between fe@xmath9 and vacancies . the same argument can be applied to mssbauer experiments , where si vacancies produced either by high - temperature annealing / quenching or by the implantation of precursor isotopes ( e.g. @xmath10mn@xmath11 ) , could interact with fe@xmath9 , ending up with fe@xmath8 defects .",
    "however , mssbauer experiments where fe was simply introduced by vacuum - deposition of an fe layer on the surface of samples which were not heat treated , apparently shows a strong fe@xmath8-related signal at room temperature , presumably without a deliberate introduction of vacancies.@xcite    these observations are rather intriguing , particularly considering that neutron activation analysis ( naa ) indicates that the total amount of fe closely matches that measured by epr,@xcite assigned to the spin-1 state of neutral fe@xmath9 . in these experiments",
    "fe was introduced by evaporation , followed by in - diffusion at 900c-1200c and quenching to minimize fe - precipitation .",
    "furthermore , the site - independent enthalpy of formation per iron atom in si obtained from naa ( @xmath12  ev ) compares well with the same quantity measured by epr ( @xmath13  ev ) , which is only sensitive to fe@xmath9 .",
    "such agreement provides compelling evidence that , under thermal equilibrium , the vast majority of isolated fe impurities occupy interstitial sites .",
    "theoretical modeling , namely electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory , is a powerful way of studying defects and their electronics .",
    "the ( apparent ) contradictions described above call for clarification , particularly in regard to the mssbauer parameters of fe - related defects in si , as well as the equilibrium concentration of fe@xmath8 ( relative to that of fe@xmath9 ) .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy is based on the recoilless emission and absorption of @xmath14-radiation from and by the nuclei of bound atoms.@xcite in the absence of a magnetic field at the nucleus , the relevant interactions are electric monopolar and quadrupolar , which are quantified by the isomer shift ( is or @xmath15 ) and the quadrupole splitting ( qs or @xmath16 ) respectively.@xcite in essence , these two parameters are sensitive to the magnitude of the contact electron density and to the non - sphericity of the density surrounding the mssbauer nucleus ( @xmath10fe in this case ) .    motivated by the impact of fe and its complexes on si based technology , ^57^fe ms has been used to study the location , diffusivity and electronic activity of elemental fe impurities.@xcite a summary of experimental and calculated is values for fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath8 defects in si and other group iv semiconductors is presented in table  [ tab : ms - survey ] .",
    "consistent agreement between theoretical and experimental values of @xmath15 has enabled the identification of fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath8 defects in si , where @xmath17  mm / s and @xmath18  mm / s.@xcite in ge , the picture also appears to be well established , with experiments and theory suggesting @xmath18  mm / s and a small , albeit positive @xmath19  mm / s.@xcite in diamond , and despite good agreement between the calculated value and the @xmath20  mm / s resonance assigned to fe@xmath9 , calculations for fe@xmath8 severely underestimate the experimental result by a factor ranging between 5 and 10 .",
    "finally , in sic there are two possible sites for fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath8 defects .",
    "the interstitial impurity can have si or c first neighbors ( fe@xmath21 or fe@xmath22 respectively ) , while substitutional fe can replace si or c atoms ( fe@xmath23 or fe@xmath24 respectively ) . while the agreement between theory and experiments is reasonable ,",
    "only a single resonance has been reported for substitutional fe , although two peaks are theoretically predicted .",
    "interestingly , the overall trend of the ms peaks in si , ge , diamond and sic,@xcite is characterized by a linear increase of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the distance between fe and its first neighbors , as depicted in figure  2 of ref .  .",

    "distinct rows are used for the values of fe with si ( fe@xmath21/fe@xmath24 ) and c ( fe@xmath22/fe@xmath23 ) first neighbors .",

    "in this work we combined pseudopotential and all - electron density functional calculations of fe - related defects in group - iv semiconductors ( mostly in si , but also in ge , c , sic and si - rich sige alloys ) . our aim was to investigate electronic and electron - nuclear coupling properties , and compare them to those measured with several spectroscopic techniques , mssbauer spectroscopy in particular .",
    "after a short review of previous experimental and theoretical reports on @xmath10fe mssbauer parameters for fe - related defects in group - iv semiconductors , we described the theoretical methodologies employed by us .",
    "this includes methods to obtain defect structures , total energies and electron densities ( paw and apw+lo methods ) , to calculate isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings , formation energies and charge transition levels .",
    "we provided a detailed description of the calculation of the mssbauer calibration constants , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these quantities allowed us to obtain the isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings from the contact densities and electric field gradients calculated from first - principles . to this end",
    ", we calculated relative contact densities and efg values for fe in a comprehensive set of fe - related compounds , and established linear relations with corresponding is and qs values obtained experimentally . the resulting values @xmath29",
    "bohr@xmath30mm / s and @xmath31  b agree well with previous calculations reported in the literature .",
    "we devoted section  [ sec : iron - defects - in - si ] to the study of fe defects in si .",
    "we started by looking at the relative stability and upper concentration limit of interstitial iron relative to that of substitutional iron in si ( assuming equilibrium conditions across a si/@xmath32-fesi@xmath33 interface ) .",
    "we found an enthalpy of formation for fe@xmath9 of 2.73  ev , which is only 0.14  ev below the figure obtained from epr experiments,@xcite and only 0.5  ev lower than the enthalpy of formation of fe@xmath8 , suggesting that the concentration of the latter defect could be relevant , particularly in n - type si , where it could act as a strong recombination center for minority carriers in solar material .",
    "looking more closely at the fe@xmath9 impurity , we confirm that it gives rise to a single donor level , calculated at @xmath34  ev ( only 0.05  ev below the well established transition measured by dlts@xcite ) .",
    "inspection of further ionization and a comparison with the fe@xmath9b@xmath8 defect allowed us to conclude that fe@xmath35 is resonant with the valence of the host .",
    "the calculated isomer shifts of neutral and positively charged fe@xmath9 in si are calculated as 0.72  mm / s and 0.67  mm / s , respectively .",
    "we attribute the rather small charge dependence of the is to the nodal character of the 3d level on fe ( which is the one involved in the donor transition ) , but also to the fact that the fe atom is in the 0 oxidation state , leaving the 4s state ( with amplitude on fe ) empty during the @xmath36 transition .",
    "the agreement between the calculated is for fe@xmath37 and the available mssbauer data in p - type si is good . on the other hand , for the neutral charge state",
    ", experiments came up with two rather different values , @xmath38  mm / s or 0.77  mm / s , clearly suggestion that further work is necessary in order to clarify the picture .",
    "the iron - boron pair was also investigated .",
    "we started by looking at the electronic structure and levels of the most stable form of this defect , where the b atom replaces a si first neighbor of the fe@xmath9 defect ( trigonal structure ) . in agreement with dlts measurements we obtained donor and acceptor levels at @xmath39  ev and @xmath40  ev , respectively",
    "the is values for the @xmath41 pairs in charge state @xmath42 are found to be rather close to those of fe@xmath9 in the @xmath43 charge state .",
    "this supports the model for the feb pair as a coulomb - stabilized complex composed by a fe@xmath37 cation next to a b@xmath44 anion .",
    "we confirm previous calculations@xcite where fe@xmath8 was predicted to be a deep acceptor .",
    "our calculations indicate a fe@xmath45 level at 0.38  ev below @xmath46 .",
    "the calculated value for the is of fe@xmath8 was @xmath47  mm / s , in line with the generally accepted value assigned to fe@xmath8 ( @xmath48  mm / s ) in mssbauer measurements .",
    "we also confirm that there is a strong binding energy between fe@xmath9 and a si vacancy .",
    "the reaction @xmath49 was found to realease about 3  ev .",
    "we investigated this reaction in - depth using the nudged elastic band method . in disagreement with the prevalent view",
    ", we concluded that the reaction kinetics is effectively limited by the migration rate of the vacancy , meaning that several spectroscopic signals ( including the nl19 center from epr ) , which were detected above room - temperature , were incorrectly connected to an iron - vacancy pair .",
    "our final analysis concerned the iron - divacancy pair ( fe@xmath9v@xmath33 ) in si , comprising a fe atom at the center of a divacancy .",
    "the fe@xmath9v@xmath33 defect was predicted to be a very deep double acceptor with levels at @xmath50  ev and @xmath51  ev .",
    "we concluded that this is a rather stable complex and should be dominant in the presence of vacancies , both after sample quenching from high temperatures , and in samples that were subject to irradiation with electrons and heavier particles .",
    "we anticipate that the mssbauer signal for the neutral complex is a doublet centered at @xmath52  mm / s and split by @xmath53  mm / s . in the negative charge state the centroid increases slightly to 0.39  mm / s but the density becomes more isotropic with @xmath54  mm / s .    finally , we studied the mssbauer parameters for fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath8 in ge , diamond , 3c - sic and si - rich sige alloys .",
    "we confirm the observed approximate linear dependence of the is with the distance between fe and its first neighbors .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiments is very good in general .",
    "additionally , we fill in some _ blanks _ and improve upon some previous calculations .",
    "this includes the assignment of fe@xmath8 and fe@xmath9 defects with specific neighbors in sic , as well as the is for fe@xmath8 in diamond .",

    "<S> we employ a combination of pseudopotential and all - electron density functional calculations , to relate the structure of defects in supercells to the isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings observed in mssbauer spectroscopy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology is comprehensively reviewed and applied to the technologically relevant case of iron - related defects in silicon , and to other group - iv hosts to a lesser degree . </S>",
    "<S> investigated defects include interstitial and substitutional iron , iron - boron pairs , iron - vacancy and iron - divacancy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in general , agreement between the calculations and mssbauer data is within a 10% error bar . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we show that the methodology can be used to make accurate assignments , including to separate peaks of similar defects in slightly different environments . </S>"
