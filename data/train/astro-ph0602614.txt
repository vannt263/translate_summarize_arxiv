    "ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) are commonly seen in the high - redshift universe .",
    "most of them are thought to be very young star - forming galaxies , although some may have an active nucleus and some could be primeval galaxies in a gas cooling phase before onset of the initial star formation or in superwind phases just after the initial star formation .",
    "the high number density of laes , roughly comparable to that of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , suggests that they are important in understanding the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "laes at @xmath20 are of particular interest in galaxy formation and cosmology , since they are not only expected to be extremely young but also an invaluable probe of the universe during or just after reionization .",
    "they can be used to infer the reionization epoch of the universe via the change in their number density ( haiman & spaans 1999 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; haiman 2002 ; malhotra & rhoads 2004 ; stern et al . 2005 ; kashikawa et al .",

    "; ouchi et al . 2005 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ) , the data obtained to date are not sufficient to place strong constraints on their fundamental properties such as the luminosity function ( lf ) , in contrast to the data of lbgs at similar redshifts . usually , narrow - band surveys are used to detect laes .",
    "their apparent faintness in both narrow bands ( i.e. , ly@xmath0 ) and broad bands ( off ly@xmath0 ) , as well as a small survey volume defined by the wavelength coverage of the narrow - band filter times the survey area , makes it difficult to obtain a large sample .",
    "samples from several small surveys by different workers could be combined to form a larger sample . however , since the selection criteria of laes and the survey depth differ among the surveys , lfs calculated from such combined samples may have systematic uncertainties difficult to control .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of a very deep survey of laes at @xmath1 in a wide , continuous area of 725 arcmin@xmath3 .",

    "we construct a sample of 89 photometrically selected laes down to @xmath2 . by followup spectroscopy with the subaru and keck ii telescopes",
    ", we obtained a sample of 34 laes with confirmed redshifts .    combining these samples with monte carlo simulations , we calculate the ly@xmath0 lf , which is the most reliable measurement for the lf of @xmath1 laes published to date .",
    "this lf serves as a zero point for the lf in the fully ionized universe ( @xmath24 ) , which is to be compared with the lf at @xmath25 to probe the reionization history of the universe . a companion paper ( kashikawa et al . 2005 ) compares the lf at @xmath1 obtained in this paper with that for @xmath26 laes , and discusses the ionization state of the intergalactic medium at @xmath26 .",
    "we also derive accurately the far uv continuum lf and the distribution of ly@xmath0 equivalent widths ( ews ) , both of which have not yet been strongly constrained for laes at @xmath20 . comparing the far uv lf of our laes with that of lbgs at @xmath27 given in the literature",

    "we introduce weighted skewness , @xmath65 , which quantifies the asymmetry of emission lines . a similar quantity ( skewness ) has been applied by kurk et al .",

    "since the ly@xmath0 emission of high - redshift galaxies tends to be wider than other emission lines of nearby galaxies in the observed frame , we include the factor @xmath79 in @xmath65 to enhance the difference between ly@xmath0 and other lines .",
    "@xmath65 is larger for objects with higher asymmetries and/or larger line widths .",

    "the @xmath65 of [ oii ] emitters is also expected to be small ( @xmath65 is measured for the doublet as a whole ) ; for all resolved [ oii ] emitters in our sample , the @xmath81 line is weaker than the @xmath82 line , meaning a negative @xmath65 ( see also rhoads et al .",

    "all these nearby objects have @xmath86 .",
    "a visual inspection of the 63 spectra reveals that most of the objects with @xmath87 have an asymmetric emission - line shape typical of high - redshift ly@xmath0 emission .    on the basis of these results ,",
    "we classify the spectroscopic objects into three classes as follows .",
    "we primarily use @xmath65 , but in some cases we also use @xmath31 and @xmath32 photometry as additional information , since laes at @xmath1 are essentially invisible in our @xmath31 and @xmath32 data due to strong absorption by the igm . if an object has the definite feature of the [ oii ] or [ oiii ] or h@xmath0 line , it is a nearby object .",
    "if an object has a single emission - line with @xmath87 , it is regarded as an lae ( irrespective of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 fluxes ) ; we assume that those with detected @xmath31 or @xmath32 fluxes are contaminated by a faint foreground object .",
    "if , on the other hand , a single - line object with @xmath86 is detected in either @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( i.e. , brighter than the @xmath88 limit in the corresponding bandpass ) , then it is classified as a nearby object .",
    "objects which do not satisfy either of the above three categories are classified as unclear objects ; unclear objects are single - line emitters with @xmath86 but invisible in both @xmath31 and @xmath32 . among the 63 objects , 34 , 19 , and 10 are classified as laes , nearby objects , and unclear objects . among the 34 laes ,",

    "this rather high contamination rate , @xmath89 , appears to be accounted for by the observed surface number density of faint @xmath90 sources .",

    "furthermore , the probability of a faint @xmath90 source being within @xmath92 of a random position in the sky is found to be about @xmath93 .",

    "the luminosity functions and star formation properties of the line - emitting galaxies at @xmath94 identified in our spectroscopy will be discussed in ly et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we infer that some portion of the unclear objects may be laes in reality .",
    "this is because ( i ) not all laes may have as large asymmetry as the confirmed laes and ( ii ) since the resolution of the focas spectra is significantly poorer than that of the deimos spectra , the absolute value of @xmath65 of an object based on a focas spectrum will be smaller than that based on a deimos spectrum . in this sense , the criterion of @xmath87 is conservative in terms of the selection of laes . among the ten unclear objects , eight are focas objects . when estimating the selection completeness of the photometric sample of @xmath1 laes in section 4 , we take account of the extreme possibility that all of the unclear objects are actually laes .",
    "( 140mm,140mm)f5.eps    figure [ fig : hist_lam ] shows the distributions of emission - line wavelengths ( the central value if the emission is a doublet ) for all of our objects .",
    "the thick solid histogram in panel ( a ) represents the distribution for the 34 laes , and panel ( b ) plots the distributions for nearby objects ( thin solid histogram ) and unclear objects ( dotted histogram ) . in both panels , the dashed curve corresponds to the response function of the nb816 band .",
    "it is found that while the distributions of nearby and unclear objects are statistically consistent with being symmetric around the central wavelength of the bandpass , the laes distribution is skewed toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "a natural explanation for this skewed distribution is as follows .",
    "laes with higher redshifts are on average fainter in nb816 ( even when the ly@xmath0 luminosity is fixed ) because of a lower fraction of the continuum emission redward of @xmath95   falling into the nb816 bandpass . hence they tend to be excluded from a list of spectroscopic targets .",
    "the dotted curve in panel ( a ) represents the distribution of modeled laes with @xmath46 in a mock sample ; this sample is constructed based on the same selection criteria as for the observed sample ( see the next section ) from a large catalog of laes generated by monte carlo simulations for a range of lae equivalent widths and luminosity function parameters ( see section 5 ) . in the simulations ,",
    "laes are distributed uniformly in comoving space over the redshift range @xmath96 , which corresponds to an observed ly@xmath0 wavelength of 8020 to 8270  .",
    "the thick histogram is found to agree fairly well with the dotted curve , suggesting that prominent large - scale structures along the line of sight are not present in our lae sample .",
    "( 2004 ) also found a skewed distribution in their @xmath1 laes selected from nb816 data in the ssa22 field , and argued that the true center in wavelength of the nb816 filter may be shifted toward shorter wavelengths by about 25    than the measured one .",
    "although we can not completely rule out this possibility , the wavelength distribution of our sample is explained without assuming such a shift .",
    "we have 34 laes with spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "their distribution in the @xmath42 vs @xmath97 plane is slightly biased toward brighter nb816 magnitudes and redder @xmath98 colors with respect to the photometric sample , except for three objects of @xmath99 . among the 34 objects , the faintest in nb816",
    "is @xmath100 mag .",
    "we measure the flux and fwhm of the ly@xmath0 line from the spectrum of each object . in this paper , however , we adopt for ly@xmath0 fluxes the values calculated from the imaging data by subtracting the continuum flux measured from the @xmath35-band image from the flux falling into the nb816 band , assuming @xmath101 = constant ; spectroscopic redshifts are used to determine the precise position of the ly@xmath0 line in the nb816 response function .",
    "the reason for not using the ly@xmath0 fluxes directly is that our multi - slit spectroscopy probably lost a non - negligible amount of ly@xmath0 photons , because of the relatively narrow slitlets ( @xmath53 and @xmath48 for focas and @xmath52 for deimos ) compared with the typical psf sizes , and because the ly@xmath0 emission could be extended spatially .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_llya ] shows ly@xmath0 luminosities measured from the spectra against those from photometry ( see subsection 5.2 for the calculation of ly@xmath0 luminosities based on the photometric data ) . while little systematic difference is seen between the luminosities from the deimos spectra and from the photometry , the focas spectra give luminosities only about one third those measured from the photometric data . among the focas objects , three were observed with a @xmath102 slitlet , and their @xmath103 ratio is @xmath104 on average .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with narrower slitlets losing a larger fraction of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "it is difficult to correct @xmath105 for this effect , since the seeing size varied during the exposures and since different objects have different intrinsic sizes .",

    "we construct a photometrically selected lae sample from the imaging data .",
    "objects located in low - quality regions of the images are excluded from the selection process to obtain an lae sample of uniform detection .",

    "malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) show that both an @xmath247 imf of @xmath248 solar metallicity and a salpeter imf of zero metallicity can produce ews @xmath249   even if they are @xmath250 yr or older , more than ten times older than the ages constrained for ordinary salpeter populations .",
    "a special configuration of the interstellar medium ( ism ) may also boost the equivalent width .",
    "hansen & oh ( 2005 ) argue that ly@xmath0 photons can preferentially escape from a dusty , multi - phase ism than continuum photons if most of the dust is in cold neutral clouds , and thus that the ew of the transmitted spectrum can be larger than the ew of the unprocessed spectrum ( see also neufeld 1991 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the observed large ews can be reproduced by older ( or steeper imf slope ) populations .",
    "agns can also produce extremely large ews .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that agns dominate in our sample , since our laes have very narrow rest - frame widths of the ly@xmath0 emission line , with a mean and rms of 1.07   and 0.68  , or @xmath251 km s@xmath5 and 168 km s@xmath5 in velocity , after correction for spectral resolution .",

    "their report is consistent with our speculation , as we are probably selecting a similar population at @xmath1 to their laes",
    ".      objects with @xmath253   are particularly interesting , since even a population of a very flat imf of @xmath247 ( but metal enriched ) can not produce such large ews unless it is younger than @xmath245 yr ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "we find in the confirmed 28 laes that 46 % ( 13 objects ) have @xmath254  . similarly , the fraction calculated from the probability distribution functions of ew is 44 % .",
    "we can also estimate the fraction from the simulations performed in subsection 5.1.1 .",
    "the simulations for the best - fit schechter parameters of the ly@xmath0 lf ( for @xmath161 and @xmath170  ) show that @xmath255 of the objects satisfying the selection criteria have input values of @xmath253  .",
    "similarly , @xmath256 of the objects satisfying the selection criteria have measured values of @xmath254  .",
    "these values are lower than the observed values , 46 % and 44 % , probably reflecting the bias in @xmath98 color in the spectroscopic target selection .",
    "alternatively , the simulations could underestimate the true fraction , since we have not been able to constrain @xmath164 so strongly .    from these results",

    "the reason for the difference between our fraction and malhotra & rhoads is not clear .",
    "the evolutionary effect is unlikely , since it implies that the fraction of large - ew objects declines with redshift , which is opposite to the increasing fraction of strong ly@xmath0 emitters in lbgs ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "recently , dawson et al . (",
    "2004 ) obtained a more reliable fraction of large - ew objects for @xmath252 laes from a sample of 17 objects with spectroscopic confirmation , but they calculated the fraction of @xmath259   in our definition , not @xmath260  .",

    "a similar calculation for our 28 spectroscopic laes finds that 7  25 % exceed @xmath262   with 90 % confidence .",
    "thus , even without absorption correction , a certain fraction of @xmath1 laes can not be accounted for by normal star formation ; the fraction is similar to that found for @xmath191 laes .",

    "finally , let us discuss an interesting implication of the large ews of @xmath27 lbgs for their far uv lf .",
    "in most cases , lbgs at @xmath27 were selected from their red @xmath299 colors , and their @xmath229 magnitudes were calculated from @xmath35-band photometry ( an important exception is the work by shimasaku et al .",

    "if an lbg at @xmath27 has @xmath301  , then its f850lp - band magnitude will be about 0.8 mag brighter than the value expected in the case of no ly@xmath0 emission , since its observed - frame equivalent width will be as large as 1300    ( exact values depending on redshift ) , which is nearly the same as the fwhm of the f850lp band .",
    "this simple calculation implies that the far - uv lf of @xmath27 lbgs calculated from @xmath35-band magnitudes will be biased toward higher luminosities .",
    "this bias is stronger for fainter lbgs , since fainter lbgs have larger ews on average ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_muv ] ) . comparing",
    "the lf at @xmath27 with those at lower redshifts will require correction to the former for this bias .",
    "the correction not only will strengthen the recent finding that the number density of bright lbgs drops from @xmath240 to @xmath27 ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "2004 ; shimasaku et al . 2005 ; bouwens et al . 2005 ) , but also might find a new trend that faint lbgs also decrease in number toward @xmath27 .",
