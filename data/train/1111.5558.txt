    "<S> it is shown that a quadratic gravitational lagrangian in the palatini formulation is able to capture different aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology in a single framework . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in this theory field excitations propagating with different energy - densities perceive different background metrics , a fundamental characteristic of the dsr and rainbow gravity approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this theory , however , avoids the so - called _ soccer ball problem_. also , the resulting isotropic and anisotropic cosmologies are free from the big bang singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity avoidance occurs non - perturbatively and shares some similitudes with the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> * how could the planck length , @xmath0 m , affect our understanding of space - time and quantum theory ? to have a chance to answer this question , </S>",
    "<S> we should first understand how @xmath1 could be made compatible with the principles of relativity and general covariance . </S>",
    "<S> the tension between the coexistence of relativity and an invariant length scale is mainly due to our view that space - time assumes a minkowskian continuous structure up to arbitrarily short scales . in this sense , to accommodate @xmath1 within our physical theories it may be useful to follow riemann s advise and modify conventional geometric concepts as one applies them _ both in the direction of the immeasurably large , and in the direction of the immeasurably small_. einstein modified the space - time structure and dynamics at large scales , but kept the minkowskian structure locally . here it will be shown that a further revision of the classical space - time structure and dynamics at microscopic scales allows to introduce @xmath1 in an invariant and universal way compatible with general covariance . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory has interesting phenomenological aspects . on the one hand , we find that particles with different energy - momentum densities perceive different background geometries , a property closely related to doubly or deformed special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite and its gravitational extension , known as rainbow gravity ( rg ) @xcite . on the other hand , the cosmological dynamics of the theory </S>",
    "<S> closely matches that of gr at all times except near the big bang singularity , which is replaced by a regular bounce that occurs near the planck density . + </S>",
    "<S> * palatini approach to the idea of fundamental length . </S>",
    "<S> * special relativity was built by requiring that the speed of light were an invariant and universal magnitude . to combine the speed of light and the planck length in a way that preserves the invariant and universal nature of both quantities </S>",
    "<S> , we first note that @xmath2 has the dimensions of a squared velocity but that @xmath3 is not a 3-velocity . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , we may see @xmath4 as an invariant with dimensions of length squared but @xmath1 not being a 3-length . </S>",
    "<S> dimensional compatibility with a curvature suggests that @xmath5 could be introduced in the theory via the gravitational sector . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is not as simple as it may seem at first because an action like @xmath6=\\frac{\\hbar}{16\\pi l_p^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}\\left[r+l_p^2r^2\\right]+s_m[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi ] \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] represents the matter sector , contains @xmath1 but not in the invariant form that we wished . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the field equations that follow from ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) are equivalent to those of a brans - dicke theory with @xmath8 , a non - zero potential @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite . as is well - known , in brans - dicke theory the observed newton s constant is promoted to the status of field : @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the effective newton s constant @xmath12 to change in time and in space and , which makes @xmath13 also vary in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite different from the assumed constancy and universality of the speed of light in special relativity and is closer to the philosophy of varying speed of light theories @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the situation does not improve if we introduce higher curvature invariants in ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) because they generate new degrees of freedom which turn newton s constant into a dynamical field . </S>",
    "<S> + a way out of this problem can be found by modifying the geometric structure of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> if we construct the theory _  la palatini _ @xcite , that is in terms of a connection not a priori constrained to be given by the christoffel symbols , then the resulting equations do not necessarily contain new dynamical degrees of freedom ( as compared to gr ) , and the planck length may remain space - time independent in much the same way as the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations that follow from ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) when metric and connection are varied independently are @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection equation can be easily solved after noticing that the trace of ( [ eq : metric ] ) , @xmath18 , represents an algebraic relation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which implies that @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 . for the particular lagrangian ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) , we find that @xmath23 , like in gr . </S>",
    "<S> the connection turns out to be the levi - civita connection of an auxiliary metric @xmath24 conformally related with the physical metric , @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> . we can now rewrite ( [ eq : metric ] ) as follows @xmath26 where @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath28 and the function @xmath29 can be seen as a @xmath20-dependent newton s constant and cosmological _ constant _ , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is very similar to that proposed in @xcite for rg , @xmath30 , with the difference that the energy @xmath31 of the particle probing the geometry is here replaced by @xmath20 which is a generally covariant function of its energy - density . from the structure of ( [ eq : gmn - pal ] ) and the relation @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that @xmath33 is affected by the matter - energy in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the first contribution corresponds to the cumulative effects of matter , and the second contribution is due to the dependence on the local density distributions of energy and momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the structure of ( [ eq : gmn - pal ] ) is similar to that of gr , which implies that @xmath24 is determined by integrating over all the sources ( gravity as a cumulative effect ) . besides that </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath33 is also affected by the local sources via the factor @xmath34 . to illustrate this point , </S>",
    "<S> consider a region of the spacetime containing a total mass @xmath35 and filled with sources of low energy - density as compared to the planck scale ( @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the quadratic model @xmath37 , in this region ( [ eq : gmn - pal ] ) boils down to @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , which implies that the gr solution is a very good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that @xmath24 is determined by an integration over the sources , like in gr . </S>",
    "<S> now , if this region is traversed by a particle of mass @xmath40 but with a non - negligible ratio @xmath41 , then the contribution of this particle to @xmath24 can be neglected , but its effect on @xmath33 via de factor @xmath42 on the region that supports the particle ( its classical trajectory ) is important . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is analogous to that described in rg , where particles of different energies ( energy - densities in our case ) perceive different metrics . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , however , naturally cures the so - called _ soccer ball problem _ for macroscopic bodies thanks to the dependence of the metric on the local energy - momentum densities rather than on the total energy - momentum of the particle . + * beyond @xmath43 theories . * </S>",
    "<S> the energy - density properties of the palatini theory ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) is maintained with a much richer phenomenology when the @xmath43 family is extended to palatini @xmath44 lagrangians , where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the symmetric ricci tensor . in this case , the connection can also be expressed as the levi - civita connection of a metric @xmath47 related with @xmath33 by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions of @xmath51 and , therefore , depend on the local densities of energy and momentum ( see @xcite for details ) . the field equations for the metric can be written in compact form as @xmath52 for a scalar field with kinetic energy @xmath53 and lagrangian @xmath54 , @xmath47 and @xmath33 turn out to be related by @xmath55 where @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . for the particular model @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> the low energy - density limit @xmath61 leads to @xmath62\\ ] ] which is in agreement with gr up to corrections of order @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> note that to this order @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as in the @xmath43 case , this indicates that @xmath47 is mainly determined by integrating over the sources ( cumulative effects of gravity ) , whereas @xmath65 and the last term of ( [ eq : hdown ] ) represent the local energy - density contributions to the metric . </S>",
    "<S> the dsr limit of this theory can be obtained by neglecting the cumulative effects of gravity , which corresponds to the limit @xmath66 . in this limit , for the @xmath44 model of above the metric </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath67 from ( [ eq : hdown - mink ] ) we see that the leading order corrections to the minkowski metric are strongly suppressed by inverse powers of the planck curvature , which indicates that a perturbative study of such contributions in field theories should be feasible at low energy densities ( see @xcite for more details ) . at high densities , however , non - perturbative effects arise . to illustrate this point , </S>",
    "<S> consider the scalar @xmath68 in the @xmath44 model of above with a perfect fluid of density @xmath69 and pressure @xmath70 @xmath71\\approx q_{gr}+\\frac{3 ( p+\\rho ) ^3}{2 r_p}+\\ldots   \\ .\\ ] ] at low densities the gr solution is recovered but , as @xmath72 approaches unity , important departures from gr must arise to avoid that the argument of the square root of ( [ eq : q-1/2 ] ) becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath69 and @xmath70 must be bounded if the dynamics is to be consistent . and </S>",
    "<S> this is so regardless of the symmetries of the theory . in the case of an isotropic frw universe with constant equation of state @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> the hubble function in the spatially flat case is @xcite @xmath74}{\\left[1+\\frac{3}{2}\\delta_1\\right]^2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 . at low densities </S>",
    "<S> , this expression exactly recovers the linear @xmath69-dependence of gr , but near the planck scale , when @xmath76 , its behavior changes reaching a maximum and then vanishing at a higher density , which implies a cosmic bounce ( see @xcite for illustrative plots ) . </S>",
    "<S> these isotropic bouncing solutions occur for all equations of state comprised within the interval @xmath77 and persist in anisotropic ( bianchi i ) spacetimes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the effective dynamics of isotropic loop quantum cosmology @xcite for a massless scalar was exactly reproduced by an @xmath43 palatini theory in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of that result to other matter sources and spacetimes with less symmetry could be naturally implemented in the context of @xmath44 theories . </S>",
    "<S> + in this talk i have shown that without imposing any a priori phenomenological structure , palatini models predict an energy - density dependence of the geometry that closely matches the structure conjectured by magueijo and smolin in @xcite but without the problems of that approach . at the same time , it avoids the big bang singularity in quite general situations and for reasonable sources of matter and energy such as dust and radiation . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that palatini theories represent a new and powerful framework to address different aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> an important lesson that can be extracted from this analysis is that quantum gravitational phenomena associated with a minimum length scale may arise non - perturbatively , being the perturbative corrections strongly suppressed . + </S>",
