    "the second pillar is under construction : spontaneous symmetry breaking responsible for the generation of masses of weak bosons .",
    "only two years ago okun argued that no experimental support existed for the existence of this pillar .",
    "we will show that this is no longer true .",
    "figure 1    in these lectures we first review the ideas of renormalizable gauge theories .",
    "the experimental support for the standard model at the born level is strong and only the main ideas will be discussed : neutral currents , spontaneous symmetry breaking and unification .",
    "we will subsequently describe the experimental evidence for the standard model as a spontaneously broken field theory .",
    "field theories are verified by measuring radiative corrections .",
    "we will illustrate how high statistics experiments are verifying the validity of the quantum structure of the standard model .    in the end",

    "pillars are incomplete or missing and we are at present in the unfortunate situation that experiment does not provide us with even a single clue as to what they are made of .",
    "in gauge theories , symmetries dictate the interactions of quarks and leptons mediated by the exchange of massless vector particles , e.g.  the photon .",
    "suppose we want to compute the ratio @xmath0 of the cross sections for the annihilation of electrons and positrons into quarks and muons : @xmath1 @xmath0 is a function of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the annihilation energy @xmath4 : @xmath5 when the annihilation energy far exceeds the light masses @xmath6 of quarks and leptons , we must expect that for the dimensionless observable @xmath0 , @xmath7 because there is no intrinsic scale in theories with massless exchange bosons .",
    "this prediction disagrees with experiment and is , in fact , not true in renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "the exchange of a massless photon is ultraviolet divergent , requiring the introduction of a cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "thus a scale is introduced into the calculation and the dimensionless observable @xmath9 is of the form @xmath10 this seems ugly ; it is not : @xmath8 appears order by order in the perturbative series but not in the final answer .",

    "the electroweak model completes fermi theory by introducing neutral currents , symmetry breaking and electroweak unification .",
    "we briefly review these next .",

    "the short range of the weak interaction results from of the exchange of a heavy gauge boson of mass @xmath59 : @xmath60 the effective coupling @xmath61 is small compared to the weak coupling @xmath49 which is of order @xmath29 .",
    "the neutral current interaction is described by a coupling @xmath62 , @xmath63 the relative strength of the neutral and charged currents is parametrized by the weak angle @xmath64 , or by the @xmath65-parameter as can be seen by comparing ( [ eq : shortrange - a ] ) with ( [ eq : neutral - a ] ) and ( [ eq : shortrange - b ] ) with ( [ eq : neutral - b ] ) , respectively .",

    "describing weak interactions requires the introduction of gauge bosons with mass .",
    "miraculous cancellations like ( [ eqfig : cancel ] ) are however a feature of gauge theories with strictly massless exchange particles like the photon . introducing mass spoils the cancellation and the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 becomes a parameter which can not be eliminated .",

    "the solution is to replace mass by friction .",
    "weak bosons only have an apparent mass which results from the drag they feel from their interaction with a universal medium , like an aether , made of scalar particles .",
    "photons , of course , do not interact with these scalar particles .",
    "this solves the problem : while gauge boson mass leads to an unrenormalizable theory , the introduction of such interactions does not .",
    "this solution may look a bit contrived but it really is not because scalar particles are required for different , totally unrelated reasons .",
    "we will show this in the next section .",
    "a more correct analogy is that the whole universe is filled with a superconducting material .",
    "a condensate of scalar particles plays the role of the condensate of cooper pairs in a real superconductor .",
    "the weak gauge fields surrounding quarks and leptons can only penetrate this superconductor over a limited depth , the meissner effect .",

    "this is not the correct interpretation because of the pedestrian ( and incorrect ) assumption that the ground state of @xmath82 is at @xmath83 , as is usual in old - fashioned textbook examples .",

    "the latter violates gauge invariance and destroys the renormalizability and predictability of the theory . in the standard model one",

    "each field has 2 components , i.e.  there are 4 real fields @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 which generate the masses of the 3 gauge bosons @xmath104 by the mechanism previously illustrated .",
    "loosely speaking , 3 of the scalar degrees of freedom become the longitudinal components @xmath105 of the now  massive \" weak intermediate bosons .",
    "the 4th component remains as a physical scalar higgs particle .",
    "it is the elusive witness of the mechanism that generated the weak boson masses ; its mass remains undetermined in terms of a parameter @xmath78 ; see ( [ eq : m - eta ] ) .",

    "so , if scalars were not invented to solve the problem of mass , they would have to be introduced to salvage unitarity .",
