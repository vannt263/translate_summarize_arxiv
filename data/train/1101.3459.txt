    "meanwhile , these massive stars produce large amounts of strong ionizing photons , and create the * ultracompact ( uc ) * * * h**ii * regions*. the uv radiation ( krumholz , mckee , klein 2005 ; peters et al .",
    "2010 ) , the pressure of the ionized gas ( keto 2002b ; krumholz et al . 2009 ; peters et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the strong stellar wind directly interact with the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "in addition , as massive stars typically form in clusters , their environments may be also influenced by their interactions both radiatively and dynamically .",
    "these interactions potentially can disperse the accretion flow , unless the system is confined or trapped by the high density molecular gas with the right physical profiles ( example solutions see keto 2002b , 2003 , 2007 ; also see galvn - madrid et al .",
    "2008 for an observational evidence of accretion ) .",
    "this is the greatest contrast to the formation of the low  mass stars , where accretion only occurs before the pre ",

    "it is necessary to understand the accretion after the formation of an uc hii .",
    "_ one key factor in determining the relative importance between these feedback mechanisms as well as gravity , and hence the subsequent evolution of the dense molecular core / envelope , is the overall geometry / morphology of the entire system .",
    "_ for example , the density distribution of the molecular gas around massive stars determines how the molecular structures are self  shielded from the ionizing photons ; and the overall geometry of the system determines how the radiation and the ionized photons can leak out of the system .    owing to their typical large distances ( a few kpc ) ,",
    "the molecular structures around the uc hii regions , are not well resolved in previous observations .",
    "how the accretion flows around individual stars and in the entire cluster is unknown .",
    "hence how the ob stars gain mass via accretion after nuclear burning begins , is also unknown .",
    "we perform new interferometric observations toward a well  studied o  type cluster forming region g10.60.4 , in order to resolve the molecular structures .",
    "the high column density and high brightness temperature of this source allow us to follow the detailed structures of the molecular gas over an extended region , at arcsecond resolutions .",
    "here we emphasize that the subject under consideration is the molecular and the ionized gas flow around a cluster of ob stars , rather than the accretion around a single massive ( proto)stellar object .",
    "this is due to the still insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "the uc hii region complex g10.6 - 0.4 is at a distance of 6 kpc ( caswell et al . 1975 ; downes et al . 1980 ) , and is still deeply embedded in a dense molecular core / envelope .",
    "the brightest uc hii region is extremely luminous ( integrated flux is 2.6 jy at 23 ghz ) ( ho & haschick 1981 ; sollins et al .",
    "2005 ; sollins & ho 2005 ) , and contains an ob cluster within a 0.05 pc region .",
    "detections of water and oh masers ( genzel & downes 1977 ; ho & haschick 1981 ; ho et al .",
    "1983 ; hofner & churchwell 1996 ; fish et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that the formation of massive stars is still ongoing .",
    "the early nh@xmath0 , cs and c@xmath6o line observations ( ho & haschick 1986 ; keto , ho , & haschick 1987 ; keto , ho , & haschick 1988 ; omodaka et al . 1992 ; ho , terebey , & turner 1994 ) unveiled a 0.5 pc scale molecular envelope .",
    "these observations also suggested that the dynamics of the majority of the molecular gas have not yet been strongly disturbed by the ysos or stellar activities .",
    "at the 0.5 pc scale , the general motion of the molecular gas appears to be dominated by gravity , showing rotation along a flattened geometry ( liu et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the inner part at the 0.1 pc scale appears to rotate faster while infalling towards the uc hii region ( keto , ho , & haschick 1987 ; keto , ho , & haschick 1988 ; liu et al .",
    "2010 ; beltrn et al .",
    "recombination line studies further suggest that the accretion flow continues across the hii boundary , while evidence of outflow can be seen in the motions and structures of the hii region at the sub",
    " arcsecond angular scale ( keto 2002 ; keto & wood 2006 ) .",
    "structures found in projection against the uc hii continuum emission from nh@xmath0 optical depth studies , suggest accretion via a very clumpy and geometrically thick rotating core at the 0.1 pc scale ( sollins & ho 2005 ) .    in this paper , we present the new arcsecond resolution ( 1@xmath7 corresponds to 0.03 pc at the distance of g10.6 - 0.4 ) molecular line ( ch@xmath0oh , nh@xmath0 , cs ) data , together with very sensitive and 0@xmath7.5 resolution 3.6 centimeter continuum observations .",
    "the linear scale of the synthesized beams is smaller than the natural scale for self - gravity ( jeans length @xmath80.1 pc for temperature @xmath82030 k and h@xmath9 number density @xmath810@xmath10 @xmath11 ) .",
    "we see an unprecedented detailed morphology of the massive accretion flow which clarifies the geometrical relation between the hot core and the envelope . with the aid of the new results and the discussions on this target source in previous publications , a more thorough understanding is achieved .    in massive star forming regions , the nh@xmath0 inversion transitions are usually regarded as reliable molecular tracers for 20100 k gas .",
    "the main hyperfine components of these nh@xmath0 lines are optically thick and may mask the detailed density structures .",
    "the satellite hyperfine components are more optically thin ( see ho & townes 1983 for a review ) . however , in most cases , the satellite hyperfine components of the nh@xmath0 ( j , k ) = ( 1,1 ) inversion transitions are blended with the main hyperfine component ; the satellite hyperfine components of the higher ( j , k ) level transitions are much weaker and are difficult to be observed with high resolutions . with a factor of @xmath8100",
    "higher einstein a coefficient , the selected ch@xmath0oh transitions potentially allow us to probe the denser regions .",
    "we simultaneously observed multiple ch@xmath0oh transitions which have comparable einstein a  coefficients ( and therefore critical densities ) , but trace a broad range of upper  level  energy ( e@xmath12 ) .",
    "these observations allow us to distinguish the hottest molecular gas directly associated with the uc hii region from the cooler envelope .",
    "the low e@xmath12 and the modest critical density of the cs ( 1 - 0 ) transition provide sufficient optical depth , which allows us to trace the molecular gas to a much more extended region .",
    "however , in the case of g10.6 - 0.4 , significant local structures can still be identified without being severely affected by the sidelobes of the dirty beam and the missing flux .",
    "the high optical depth of cs ( 1 - 0 ) also provides better signal  to  noise ratio to the geometrically thinner expansional signatures , and provides information for the on  going feedback processes .",
    "the observational results are presented in section [ chap_result ] . in section [ chap_discussion ]",
    ", we discuss the physical implication of the overall geometrical picture of the region . in addition",

    "the frequency separation of these two lines is only marginally resolved .",
    "considering that these two lines trace similar physical conditions , and the line - widths are broad in the observed region , we regard the blended lines as one single line in this research , and denote it henceforth as ch@xmath0oh 5(2,3)4(2,2 ) .",

    "free emission based on spectral index measurements .",

    "we see that :    * the highest excitation ch@xmath0oh transition ( blue ) exclusively traces a compact ( @xmath80.1 pc ) flattened hot toroid in the center ( @xmath8300k , klaassen et al .",
    "2009 ; @xmath887 k , beltrn et al .",

    "* we see the complicated structures from the extended ch@xmath0oh emissions .",
    "the majority of the ch@xmath0oh emission has a southeast  northwest distribution .",
    "two low column density cavities are clearly seen northeast and southwest of the hot toroid .",
    "we note that the size scale of the region where we detect significant emissions is small as compared with the angular size scale of the sma primary beam ( @xmath81@xmath15 ) and that of the vla primary beam ( @xmath82@xmath15 ) .",
    "since the detected structures are well centered within the primary beams , they are not affected by the primary beam attenuation .",
    "we therefore do not perform primary beam corrections to the maps .",
    "the shortest baselines of the ch@xmath0oh and the nh@xmath0 data sets ( table [ table_molecule_list2 ] ) correspond to the maximum angular size scale of @xmath835@xmath7 and @xmath890@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "hence the absence of structures with angular size scales @xmath520@xmath7 suggests that the compact appearance of the emissions is physical in nature , and is not caused by sampling defects .    from figure [ fig_nh3 ]",
    ", we see that most structures traced by the ch@xmath0oh emissions have their nh@xmath0 counterparts ; however , the nh@xmath0 emission shows more significantly detected structures than the ch@xmath0oh emissions .",
    "a similar effect appears in the velocity domain .",

    ", we see that :    * the ch@xmath0oh 5(-3,3)4(-3,2 ) e transition has the highest upper  level energy e@xmath12 of 96.9 k. the pv diagram of this transition reveals the fast rotating hot toroid . * the ch@xmath0oh transitions with lower upper  level energies trace the molecular gas in a more extended region .",
    "a significant velocity gradient is also seen in the extended emission .",
    "* from the left most panel of figure [ fig_ch3ohpv ] , we see that the dominant emission of the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) main hyperfine inversion line shows a good agreement with the ch@xmath0oh emissions .",
    "the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) absorption line consistently traces the fast rotating hot toroid as seen in the pv diagram of the ch@xmath0oh 5(-3,3)4(-3,2 ) e transition .",
    "additionally , the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) emission shows significant detections of broad line emission features ( e.g. at 7@xmath7 and 11@xmath7 ) and some diffuse broad line emission ( e.g. around -3@xmath7 -11@xmath7 ) .",
    "the nh@xmath0 molecule has a stable abundance over a large range of densities and temperature without depletion onto grains .",
    "hence its emission lines can be used to trace the dynamics in the bulk of the dense molecular accretion flow .",
    "the detected velocity gradients can be explained by the marginally centrifugally supported motion of the molecular gas , in response to the gravity of the enclosed molecular and the stellar mass ( see liu et al .",
    "2010 for more discussions ) .",
    "the projected area and the rotational motions traced by the ch@xmath0oh are highly consistent with those which are traced by the nh@xmath0 emissions .",
    "this suggests that these two molecules are tracing dense gas in the same region .",
    "nevertheless , there are differences in their detailed brightness distributions which suggest that in this particular source , the ch@xmath0oh emissions are tracing different excitation / chemical conditions ( e.g. temperature ) , in the same flow traced by nh@xmath0 ( see also the discussions for the ch@xmath0oh emissions in liu , ho & zhang 2010 ) . in addition , the abundance of the ch@xmath0oh molecule may also be affected by outflow .    the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) main hyperfine inversion transition has comparable upper  level energy ( e@xmath12/k = 124.5 k ) with the highest excitation ch@xmath0oh 5(-3,3)4(-3,2 ) e transition ( e@xmath12/k = 96.9 k ) , but in contrast it shows an extended distribution .",
    "one explanation is that the nh@xmath0 molecule has a higher abundance ( [ nh@xmath0]/[h@xmath9 ] = 10@xmath21 ; keto , ho & haschick 1987 ) than the ch@xmath0oh molecule ( [ ch@xmath0oh]/[h@xmath9 ] = 2@xmath2210@xmath23 ; takakuwa , ohashi , & hirano 2003 ) , and thus becomes optically thick and shows strong emission .",
    "the excellent match between the nh@xmath0 emission and the lowest excitation ch@xmath0oh emission suggests that the emissions of both molecules trace the real physical structures .",
    "we know that for the dense gas with temperature around 50 k , the statistical weight compensates the boltzmann factor , and therefore the population of nh@xmath0 at the ( 3,3 ) level can be comparable to the population at the lowest excitation ( 1,1 ) level . the ch@xmath0oh emissions and the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) main hyperfine emission may both trace a population of molecular gas which is significantly warmer and denser than the ambient molecular gas .",
    "_ we call this warm ( @xmath2430 k ) and dense ( @xmath510@xmath10 @xmath11 ) region the massive envelope hereafter . _",
    "the previous observations on c@xmath6o ( 21 ) unveiled a parsec scale filamentary structure in the south of the massive envelope ( ho , terebey , & turner 1994 ) .",
    "the distribution of the molecular mass on an even larger scale has to be further examined by sensitive single  dish maps .",
    "the selected ch@xmath0oh transitions have higher einstein a  coefficients than the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) main hyperfine inversion transition , and potentially only trace the denser components .",
    "the observations in the clearest example of photon - dominated regions ( pdr ) , the orion bar , further suggest that the ch@xmath0oh emissions trace the clumpy materials , which have an h@xmath9 volume density higher than 10@xmath25 @xmath11 , and are self - shielded from photo ionization ( leurini et al .",
    "2010 ) . the abundance of the ch@xmath0oh molecule can be greatly enhanced if the molecular gas is shocked by high velocity outflows with velocities greater than @xmath820 kms@xmath26 ( see discussions in takakuwa , ohashi , & hirano 2003 ) .",
    "we therefore can not rule out the possibilities that zones with locally enhanced ch@xmath0oh abundance / emission are distributed over the entire region .",
    "part of those extended nh@xmath0 emissions can also be attributed to the externally heated lower density surfaces of the extended structures .",
    "other possibilities will have to be investigated by higher resolution observations which define the detailed temperature and density profiles of individual local structures .      in figure",
    "[ fig_ionout ] , we compare the distribution of the molecular gas traced by the ch@xmath0oh transitions with the distribution of the ionized gas traced by the 3.6 cm free  free continuum emission . by comparing the left panel of figure [ fig_nh3 ] with this figure , we find that the 3.6 cm free - free continuum emissions peak at the hot toroid .",
    "the distribution of the extended free - free continuum emission fits into the projected area of the low column density cavities seen in the ch@xmath0oh rgb map .",
    "these observed features suggest an overall geometry of a core  envelope ",
    "cavity system .",
    "this overall geometry resembles the standard disk  envelope system in the low mass ( @xmath31 m@xmath4 ) star forming region with bipolar outflow and outflow cavity , except on a larger and more massive scale .",
    "this overall geometry remains even after the embedded ob cluster starts the nuclear burning , and other physical processes start to affect the dynamical evolution ( section [ chap_introduction ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the subject under consideration is the formation and accretion of a cluster of ob star . by comparing the flux of the ionizing photons and the bolometric luminosity ,",
    "ho and haschick ( 1981 ) suggested that a few massive stars ( from 06.5 to b0 ) have already been formed and are embedded in the central 0.1 pc region ( see also the discussions in keto 2002 , sollins & ho 2005 , and keto & wood 2006 ) .",
    "this cluster of ob stars contains @xmath8200 m@xmath4 of stellar mass in total . as pointed out by sollins and ho ( 2005 ) , the source g10.6 - 0.4 stands distinct from the cases where a single massive star dominates at the center ( e.g. iras 20126 , iras 18089 , g192.16 , etc .",

    "the 1.3 mm continuum emission arises predominantly from the free - free continuum emission in the central 2@xmath73@xmath7 uc hii region ; in the extended region , the 1.3 mm continuum emission traces the thermal dust emission ( liu et al .",

    "the general agreement between the cs ( 10 ) image and the 1.3 mm continuum image indicates that cs ( 10 ) also traces the molecular hydrogen .",
    "however , in the optically thick case , the velocity integrated flux of cs ( 10 ) can be biased by saturation and/or foreground absorption , and also by the non  uniform excitation temperature .",
    "these explain some inconsistency between the cs ( 10 ) velocity integrated image and the 1.3 mm continuum image . by inspecting the position  velocity diagrams ( section [ chap_pv ] ) , we do not see a gap of emission line , and therefore we argue that the self  absorption does not severely affect the overall picture of geometry .",
    "the excitation temperature only changes the relative strength of emissions , and should not greatly alter the overall picture either , as long as the excitation does not change by a very large factor .",
    "the distribution of the cs ( 10 ) emissions is consistent with the overall geometry suggested by our observations of the ch@xmath0oh j=5 transitions .",
    "however , instead of seeing a clean biconical feature as in the ch@xmath0oh maps , we detect significant cs ( 1 - 0 ) emission in the projected area of the biconical cavity .",
    "this can be due to the fact that the cs ( 10 ) transition has a much lower upper  level  energy ( e@xmath12 = 2.35 k ) , and a factor of @xmath850 lower einstein a  coefficient .",
    "these two factors make cs easily excited in the outer layer of the cavity  wall with lower temperature ( and molecular gas density ) .",
    "this property allows us to robustly detect the dynamics of the cavity  wall , and explicitly measure the expansional velocity .",

    "we see that the arcsecond scale structures have a high contrast with respect to the background diffuse emission .",
    "we note that it is unlikely that our images can achieve the theoretical rms noise level if the extended diffuse emission has dominant contributions to the total flux .",
    "the small scale emissions may come from compact dense molecular cores , or from local structures with high temperature or high cs abundance owing to the interactions with the ( proto)stellar activities and shocks .",

    "we present high resolution observations of molecular lines and free - free continuum for the uc hii region g10.60.4 .",
    "the resolved projected distributions of the molecular gas and the ionized gas suggest an overall picture consisting of an extended ( @xmath80.5 pc ) envelope , a single compact ( @xmath80.1 pc ) hot rotating toroid , and a biconical molecular cavity filled with ionized gas .",
    "this overall geometry resembles the standard envelope  disk and protostellar outflow model for the low  mass star forming region . with the presence of the biconical cavity , we suggest that the radiative pressure can be significantly reduced.in the plane of rotation , at the scale larger than 1@xmath7 ( 0.03 pc ) , we see that the rotational motion of the dense gas is not severely disturbed , which consistently suggests that the radiation is not yet important for the molecular accretion flow",
    ". the stellar radiation may increase and play a more important role as the stellar mass is increased .    from the observations of cs ( 10 )",

    "the expansional signatures are also detected in the uc hii region b and c , which are driven by the ionized gas pressure and the stellar wind .",
    "the expansional motions of the uc hii regions significantly disturb the local dynamics of the molecular gas , inject the energy , and may induce the non - uniformity in the molecular accretion flow , which is an important feedback mechanism in the massive molecular clump .",
