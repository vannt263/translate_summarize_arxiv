    "the idea of tipping points has captured the public s attention from topics as diverse as segregation , marketing , rioting , and global warming .",
    "robustness considerations have extended beyond engineering and ecology to political regimes , computer algorithms , and decision procedures . analyzing and exploiting path dependence plays a significant role in technology spread , institutional design , legal theory and the evolution of culture .",
    "however these concepts have not been generally and formally defined and , as a result , the terms uses across these various applications are hardly consistent . at times",
    "a tipping point refers to a threshold beyond which the system s outcome is known .",
    "other times ` tipping point ' is used to describe an event that suffices to achieve a particular outcome , or an aspect of such an event , or the time of such an event .",
    "another use of tipping points is to label the conditions to which the system is most sensitive . the idea is frequently tied up with processes such as positive feedback , externalities , sustainable operation , perturbation , etc . robustness and path dependence share",
    "also in this preponderance of senses and this paper aims to elucidate the distinctions among these and other uses of the terms .    to accomplish this conceptual analysis this paper puts forth formal definitions for each concept ( with an implied algorithm ) to measure properties of system dynamics .",
    "the analysis utilizes markov model representations of systems and so definitions of the foundational concepts of system dynamics ( equilibrium , basin of attraction , support , etc . )",
    "are first provided",
    ". then various tipping point - related concepts are described , defined , and illustrated with a simplified graphical example .",
    "this treatment is then repeated for robustness - related concepts and then again for a variety of path sensitivities in system dynamics .",
    "an additional section identifies projects for future work in considerable detail . through presentations and conversations",
    "the techniques presented here have garnered considerable interested from within academics and from government and industry .",
    "the next step is clearly to apply these measures to existing data and models to refine the measures and contribute to science .",
    "a planned extension provides a methodology ( and software ) to ( automatically ) generate the state transition representation from observational and model - generated data .",
    "this software tool is necessary for many of the intended and most useful applications of these measures .",
    "there is an additional and unexpected potential conceptual benefit to the robustness formalization presented here for the philosophical study of dispositional properties .",
    "dispositions such as fragile , soluble , and malleable have long resisted necessary and sufficient conditions to distinguish them from categorical properties ( like red , liquid , and square ) .",
    "the formal definition of one dispositional property ( robust ) may shed some conceptual light on how to proceed .",
    "other research thrusts that extend the conceptual and methodological benefits of what follows are also presented .",
    "this paper applies methods from ergodic theory , network theory and graph theory to whole systems encoded as markov models to find and measure tipping points , robustness , and path sensitivity in system dynamics .",
    "the fusion of these techniques to this purpose is novel , but certainly there is nothing unprecedented about analyzing systems to find these properties or modeling dynamics with markov models .",
    "but since this paper represents the first marriage of these two realms , the story thus far must be told as two separate threads .",
    "much previous work in finding and measuring properties of system dynamics has focused on explanation - the answering of the ` why ' question .",
    "not surprisingly since these papers , books , and discussions were couched in scientific contexts where a particular phenomenon ( or class of phenomena ) required explanation .",
    "each such jaunt into explaining tipping points , robustness , or path dependence was accompanied by a custom - suited methodology capable of generating and detecting that property in the model provided ( to answer the ` how ' question ) .",
    "these models achieved varying levels of generality , but each was limited by the desire to explain the property in a particular model or context .",
    "this is limiting because in order to explain how a process generates ( say ) path dependent behavior one has to model that process explicitly .",
    "the current work is one of pure methodology rather than a purported model of any particular system or causal apparatus .",
    "it is meant to be completely abstract and general and therefore capable of measuring these system properties in any system . because it does not model any generating process it can not address the ` why ' or ` how ' questions .",
    "it is not meant to .",
    "this paper answers the ` whether ' and ` how much ' questions .",
    "these questions are also asked in previous work , but results could not be compared between models because the methodology was model - specific .",
    "a general methodology provides a framework through which all modelers ( and some data analysts ) can determine whether and how much of each of these properties of system dynamics obtains @xmath0 and compare results across models regardless of the generating mechanisms .",
    "the ability to compare measures across systems is achieved through a focus on scale - free measures - measures that do not depend on the size of the system being analyzed .",
    "this framework allows scientists to focus on making appropriate models of their subject - matter by eliminating the burden of figuring out how to measure these properties for their model .",
    "here i review some previous work that includes the similar measured properties to highlight where this methodology might prove useful .",
    "the term ` tipping point ' was first coined by morton grodzins in 1957 @xcite to describe the threshold level of non - white occupants that a white neighborhood could have before `` white flight '' occurred .",
    "the term continued to be used in this context through the work of eleanor wolf @xcite and thomas schelling @xcite who also extended the concept to other similar social phenomena . though these researchers had a specific usage with narrow focus , the idea of a critical parameter value past which aggregate behavior is recognizably different spread across disciplines where its meaning and application varied considerably .",
    "malcolm gladwell s pop sociology book _ the tipping point _",
    "@xcite has played a significant part in bringing the term to the public s awareness .",
    "the notion of tipping point most frequently used by gladwell is an event that makes something unusual ( such as hush puppy shoes ) become popular .",
    "more precisely this is a critical value for producing a phase transition for percolation in certain heterogeneous social network structures .",
    "this form of tipping point behavior also appears in the work of mark granovetter @xcite and peyton young @xcite for the propagation of rioting behavior and technology respectively .",
    "this version of tipping will play only a minor role in what follows , however the fact that the expression has made it into the everyman s conceptual vocabulary boosts the importance of establishing rigorous scientific definitions to disambiguate loose usage .",
    "a recent trend in reports of climate change is to refer to a hypothesized tipping point in global warming and ice cap and glacial melting .",
    "james e. hansen has claimed that `` earth is approaching a tipping point that can be tilted , and only slightly at best , in its favor if global warming can be limited to less than one degree celsius . ''",
    "@xcite this usage reflects hansen s belief that `` humans now control the global climate , for better or worse . ''",
    "gabrielle walker states , `` a tipping point usually means the moment at which internal dynamics start to propel a change previously driven by external forces .",
    "@xcite '' it is unclear whether walker s and hansen s comments are compatible ; the conceptual ambiguity of the terms may be making them talk past each other .",
    "but even if their usage is meaningful within their fields , they fail as general characteristics . identifying tipping points ( as a property of system dynamics ) should not depend on whether humans are in control of system behavior or what is driving the dynamics ( even if explaining why those are the dynamics does ) .",
    "but not all heretofore definitions of the term ` tipping point ' have been loose or subject - matter specific .",
    "it is often deployed as a semi - technical term in equation - based models of various sorts .",
    "for example , it can refer to an unstable manifold in a differential equation model , the set of boundary parameters for comparative statistics @xcite , or inflection points in the behavior of functional models .",
    "each of these uses of ` tipping points ' conforms to our intuitive sense of the term s meaning and at some slightly higher level of abstraction these tipping behaviors are the same - and match the definitions provided in this paper . but not all models can be faithfully represented as systems of equations and this limits the usefulness of equation - dependent definitions .",
    "one set of tests we can perform on the compatibility of current analysis is to generate markov models based on the existing differential equation and comparative static models and then determine whether the definitions provided here identify the same states as tipping points .",
    "such a project is left for future work .",
    "robustness considerations are already a common analysis path for researchers in many fields : ecology , engineering , evolutionary biology , logistics , computer science , decision theory , and even statistics .",
    "models in these fields are often developed specifically to enhance system robustness , avoid system failures , mitigate vulnerabilities , and otherwise cope with variations in an unpredictable environment .",
    "these previous analyses provide some understanding of what features make certain systems persist and others fail , but there is little in the area of general theory .",
    "one hope is that the present construction of general measures of robustness - related concepts will inform and facilitate the construction of general theories of what systemic features produce these properties of system dynamics .",
    "if it can reveal that robust configurations and dynamics in these varied fields can be captured by a single measure , then we will have taken the first step towards a unified theory of robustness .",
    "understanding how social systems can be both simultaneously flexible and strong has garnered increasing interest recently . in an upcoming book",
    "jenna bednar investigates how institutional design can affect the robustness of a federalist governing body @xcite .",
    "`` by explicitly acknowledging the context dependence of institutional performance , we can understand how safeguards intersect for a robust system : strong , flexible , and able to recover from internal errors . ''",
    "bednar has identified the properties that make institutional system robust ( compliance , resilience , and adaptation ) in a way that is somewhat specific to the subject matter . that is beneficial and to be expected for explaining and improving the robustness of political institutions .",
    "such an analysis stands to gain from the conceptual refinements derived from formal measures of multiple robustness - related features of system dynamics .",
    "bednar s work especially underlies the thought that understanding many systems of interest requires more than traditional equilibria analysis ; the dynamic nature of dissipative structures ( see example [ dissipativestructure ] ) requires new notions of stability , resilience , and robustness that i hope to help inform through the provided measures .",
    "thomas sargent has made extensive use of principles from robust control theory in his analysis of monetary policy and pricing ( and other topics ) .",
    "the sense of ` robustness ' used in robust control theory is a gap between modeled levels and actual levels of parameters .",
    "it is used to formalize misinformation , uncertainty , and lack of confidence in agents knowledge and , more generally , to facilitate high levels of performance despite errors and in known less - than - ideal conditions .",
    "this sense of robustness applies across the decision theoretic sciences and planning literature ( e.g. the work of rob lempert and company @xcite ) . however , not all robustness analyses are to cope with uncertainty .    in genetics",
    "the term robustness refers to a species consistency of phenotype through changes in the genotype .",
    "robustness can be considered at two levels : 1 ) through how much mutation is a member of a species viable and 2 ) how much genetic variation is required to transform a species physical characteristics .",
    "the first level takes genetic profiles of organisms and determines which can survive to reproductive age and which can not ( or are sterile ) .",
    "the number of genotypic variations that remain viable is a measure of the species robustness @xmath0 according to that usage . on the evolutionary time scale",
    "we wish to understand how incremental genetic drift is responsible for large phenotypic variations over time .",
    "walter fontana has demonstrated that a network of neutral mutations ( ones that do not affect fitness ) can sufficiently explain the observed punctuated equilibria ( see example [ punctuatedequilibria ] ) in species evolution @xcite . though fitness may remain neutral through some genetic variation , the connection between fitness change and phenotype change is strong . a model that tracks fitness through genetic variations",
    "could then approximately measure how robust each stage in the evolutionary progression is .",
    "it is clear that these two concepts of robustness are distinct ; and they are both distinct from control and decision theories usage as well .",
    "we can add robustness measures from statistics and computer science to the variety of senses that ` robustness ' can take . in computer science an algorithm , procedure , measure , or",
    "process is robust if small changes ( errors , abnormalities , variations , or adjustments ) have a proportionally small affect on the algorithm , procedure , measure , or process .",
    "the time complexity of two algorithms may change in different ways .",
    "algorithm a may require one step per input ( @xmath1 ) and algorithm b may require one step per two to the power of the input size ( @xmath2 ) ; in this case algorithm a is more robust to changes in input size .",
    "statistical robustness is either when an estimator performs sufficiently well despite the assumptions required by that estimator being violated or when ( like in computer science ) a measure changes little compared to changes in the input . for example , the median is a more robust measure than the mean because to alter the median a data point has to cross the median point , whereas any input value change will change the mean s value .    and there are more variations in information theory , data security , engineering , law , ecology , and just about every field has their own version of robustness .",
    "they all share certain high - level conceptual commonalities , but differ in their details and criterion for application .",
    "the definitions below produce necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of several robustness - related concepts .",
    "there are many different ways in which systems can cope with variation are each has its own definition",
    ". this level of refinement ( combined with a very inclusive markov modeling technique ) may be able to bring discussions of robustness in the different fields to a single table and foster inter - discipline research .",
    "the level of interest in explaining path dependent processes has risen in recent years .",
    "this is in part due to an overall appreciation for the importance of such dynamics in complex systems across domains .",
    "this is also partly due to a natural need to explain observed path dependent phenomena such as convention lock in ( e.g. qwerty keyboards ) , climate change , and political instability . and",
    "another part is due to an increased prevalence in models wherein path dependence could potentially be formally measured .",
    "each technique to measure path dependence requires a definition to characterize path dependence in a manner measurable by the formal machinery presented . because previous work focused on explaining path dependence through demonstrating sufficient mechanisms to generate it , and this paper s goals are to provide a general system - level definition and way to measure it",
    ", the current work will only barely touch on previous research .",
    "yet insofar as the definitions should be compatible it is worth taking a look at previous , recent formal definitions of path dependence in the literature .    according to james mahoney @xcite",
    "there are three basic characteristics of path dependence in the social science literature .",
    "the first type of path dependence appreciates sensitivity to events that take place in the early stages of a sequence of events .",
    "secondly , there are some historical events early in the sequence that are not explained by prior events . finally , the sequence of events exhibit some kind of `` inertia '' culminating in an equilibrium - type outcome .",
    "though later analyses ( including this one ) deny these characteristics in favor of other ones , this work does demonstrate some popular thoughts in the formal literature on path dependent processes .",
    "paul pierson presents one definition that contrasts with mahoney s . in pierson",
    "s work path dependence describes how early historical events act to select among multiple possible equilibria .",
    "this equilibria selection process , however , is due to exogenous shocks to the system , a characterization which does not seem necessary for a definition of path dependence .",
    "it does ring true that if only one equilibria - like outcome is possible then system ought to be characterized as * path independent * ( or at least that the outcome be characterized as path - independent ) .",
    "kollman & jackson have a variant of page s definition of path dependence ( see below ) - one that applies only to specifically parameterized dynamical system models and requires `` very specific and stringent conditions in order for there to be path dependence @xcite . ''",
    "path dependence is revealed when a certain time - varying autoregressive parameter is ( or converges to ) one as the system s dynamics progress through specified shocks .",
    "one of their results is that `` several steps ought to be taken prior to proposing that some process is path dependent .",
    "such a proposal should be based on rigorous analysis of the process at issue .",
    "we can not offer a set of computational tools that can be used ` off the shelf . '",
    "there is no substitute for theoretical modeling appropriate to the system under study as a first step.@xcite '' indeed , building a data - generating model is a necessary first - step for measuring path dependence in most cases .",
    "however , if data satisfies certain properties ( described in the next section ) then the methodology presented in this paper can be used `` off the shelf '' to measure the degree of many forms of path dependence ( see _ automatically generating the markov model _ in the future work section for more details ) . if one is primarily interested in finding out whether and how much path dependence a process produces , however , the model need not be specified with the details required by their methodology",
    "such model - level tinkering is only necessary to provide an explanation of whence the path dependence .",
    "but if we accept that there are very many mechanisms that can generate path - dependence and that this feature of the mechanisms will be revealed through the data they produce , then we can ignore the mechanisms specifics when measuring their degrees of path dependence .",
    "this is the approach taken here .",
    "the work of scott page in identifying the types and causes of path dependence @xcite is closest in flavor to the work presented here .",
    "though again an example of mechanism identification , the motivation identified in his introduction applies equally to this paper and is worth including here .    _",

    "markov modeling has a long history in mathematics , engineering , and in applications to fields as diverse as condensed matter physics , genomics , sociology , and marketing .",
    "techniques to use markovian processes to uncover information about system dynamics fall within the field of ergodic theory . several properties and techniques from standard markov modeling",
    "are employed below . in their abstract form",
    "one can compute features such as the equilibrium distribution , expected number of steps between two states ( with standard deviation ) , reversibility , and periodicity .",
    "these features gain added meaning when interpreted for the system being modeled , but this paper utilizes them as part of defining ( and creating algorithms to uncover ) interesting system dynamic properties .",
    "computer scientists have long been analyzing networks in the form of actual communication networks as well as various abstractions from these problems .",
    "they have invented several useful measures and exceptionally well - crafted algorithms to calculate connectedness , load - bearing properties , path switching , transmission speed , and packet splitting and fusion to name a few .",
    "my analysis borrows heavily from this work in terms of algorithms , though each has been repurposed to the abstract markov model system representation .",
    "computer science is also the home of finite state machines : mathematical objects that share their states & transitions structure with markov models ( though state machines are frequently not probabilistic ) .",
    "the states of a finite state machine represent the internal states of some agent and the transitions represent the behavior rules by which agents change their states .",
    "few of the techniques invented to analyze finite state machines will apply to this research because few are adapted to purely probabilistic transitions .",
    "hardware engineers and their physicist partners have worked out several interesting measures for circuit design problems .",
    "multiple paths , variable resistance , flow injection , capacitance and many other characteristics of electronic circuits have analogs in the markov models presented below .",
    "though these are only partially explored at this stage , future work will look deeply at borrowing techniques from circuit research .    and",
    "finally graph theory offers a few useful measures for our purposes , and moreover provides a wealth of definitions for graph structure and node relationships .",
    "structural properties will play a larger role in future work addressing changes of resolution and in establishing equivalence classes of system dynamics .",
    "also , many of the features that graph theory identifies have been given alternative definitions that underlie the probabilistic nature of the markov model analysis .",
    "few explicit references to previous work in these methodological subjects appear below because the methods used generally fall in the category of common knowledge .",
    "when a specific algorithm or specialized technique is used , a reference is provided .",
    "the measures defined here are meant to stand on their own as improvements in our conceptual understanding of the included features of system dynamics . by differentiating and formally defining these properties of processes we gain both a common vocabulary with which to discuss our models and a detailed typography of behavior to include and detect in system models .",
    "many of the applications i have in mind are to include these measures in constructive models across multiple disciplines where the models are iterated with multiple initial settings and/or have stochastic parameters . these include game theoretic models , network models , physical models , and the whole gamut of models",
    "which may be considered agent - based .",
    "certain static data sets , the sorts collected by surveys , are also analyzable via this methodology .",
    "the data must satisfy certain criteria to be thus analyzable - basic properties it must have before even considering the statistical issues involved with particular applications .",
    "there must be    1 .",
    "data across time ( because we re measuring properties of dynamics ) 2 .",
    "repeated system states ( so the markov model is nt deterministic ) 3 .   known ( or known to be fixed ) time between observations    to have repeated system states from collected data we typically will need data from multiple independent trials . in some cases independence will not be true but will be a useful / necessary approximation .",
    "for example , voter data from each state or county are not truly independent , but each state or county could constitute a separate trial . in many ways these considerations parallel issues already present in statistical analysis , though the motivation for these requirements are quite different .",
    "other features of typical statistical analysis will also show up in this technique s application ( e.g. correlation , covariance , fixed effects , kurtosis ) , but they will not be highlighted except where doing so enhances the discussion .    in some cases",
    "the data may be recoded or otherwise translated into system states in such a way to as to highlight those features of the system we wish to track and uncover the tippiness , robustness and path sensitivities of . in some cases this will be a resolution choice , in others this will be a shift to recording markov states as rate changes , and in others it may be converting fixed - time dynamics into event - drive dynamics .",
    "it will take expertise to determine which , if any , conversion is necessary and a great deal of trial and error to develop that expertise . eventually standards will be uncovered as people build proficiency in this methodology .",
    "a final consideration has nothing to do with the structure and format of the data . even if the data is amenable to the analyses presented below",
    ", the data may not be observations from a system for which we think robustness or path sensitivity apply .",
    "for example , even if we could run the robustness analysis on voter data , it is not clear what the result would be telling us .",
    "similarly , given any set of real numbers we can calculate the mean value , but there is no useful interpretation of that mean value for some sets of real numbers ( e.g. telephone numbers ) .",
    "path sensitivity , however , is something we expect to uncover in poll data and so the amenability of the voter data to the markov modeling enables this analysis .",
    "the modeling and analysis techniques need to be both possible _ and _ appropriate , but only a human can determine appropriateness .",
    "one promising application of the measures and methods defined in this paper is in developing self - managing large - scale systems - so - called _",

    ".    the following might be the case for some system : once the energy level of the current state drops below three the system is at most three transitions away from being in an attractor . though having an energy level is not part of the system that the markov model represents we can associate this property of system dynamics with each state of the system as if it were one of its possible levers",
    "then we can explore the relations of specific values of this property of system dynamics to its other dynamics .",
    "relating values of properties of system dynamics back to aspects within the model will also provide useful information in many cases .",
    "in some system analyses the property of interest is what is available for the future @xmath0 in the most general terms .",
    "if one does not know much a system s dynamics then even knowing how many states could potentially be transitioned to provides an informational benefit .",
    "the measures below become increasingly refined and detailed , but we start with some simple measures that may suffice for some applications .",
    "[ stretch ] a state s is the number of states in its reach .",
    "so the stretch of @xmath28 equals @xmath138    [ criticalbehavior ] a system dynamic ( i.e. a particular state transition ) is considered _ critical behavior _ if and only if it produces a decrease in stretch ; that is , critical behavior is any @xmath59 such that @xmath139    in addition to identifying the transitions that limit the system s future states , we can also measure how critical the transition is .",
    "subtracting the end state s stretch from the start state s stretch provides such a measure , but it is not scale - free and so can not be readily compared across different systems .",
    "we can normalize the stretch difference with the size of the system to which it is being applied to produce a percentage measure .",
    "[ stretchgap ] the _ stretch - gap _ of a transition is the change in the percent of the total number of states that can be reached .",
    "this quantity equals @xmath140    because this measure includes the total number of states in the system it clearly is not scale - free either .",
    "however despite this limitation it does provide information about the system s future and is an intuitive way to compare transitions within the same system - even at different resolutions .",
    "as example [ dropexample ] below demonstrates the stretch - gap reports how much of the system s state space is cut off by each transition and this information could be used , for example , to manipulate system dynamics to prolong system longevity .",
    "we also have an alternative , fully scale - free , measure of the drop in reach across a transition .    [ criticality ] a * transition s * _ criticality _ is one minus the ratio of the start and end states stretch .",
    "the criticality of @xmath59 equals @xmath141    recall from theorem [ decreasingreach ] that from any initial starting point , as the system transitions through its states the sizes of the states reach are monotonically decreasing . as a result of that theorem",
    "we have the following corollary regarding the range of values for the ratio of reaches .    a transition s criticality will be between zero and one .",
    "let @xmath142 and @xmath143 for transition @xmath59 . from theorem [ decreasingreach ] @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath145 produces @xmath146 which yields a criticality of zero . for @xmath147",
    "we can decrease @xmath148 or increase @xmath149 to find the other bound , but since @xmath148 and @xmath149 are natural numbers increasing @xmath149 is the better approach . using a well - known mathematical fact suffices for finding the other bound : @xmath150 .",
    "transitions within a cycle ( which includes self - transitions ) always have zero criticality and zero stretch - gap .",
    "this observation follows from observations [ reachcycle ] and [ reachcore ] and the definition of a core .",
    "the concept of criticality agrees with this measure insofar as any transition that has no affect on what states may be visited in the future should not be a critical transition .",
    "[ dropexample ] the system represented as figure [ criticalityexample ] has thirty - three states in total .",
    "each one is color - coded by its stretch .",
    "compare the patterns in color to the attractors , basins , and support in figure [ equilbasin ] and the overlap in figure [ overlapdiagram ] .",
    "stretch alone , though a rather simplistic measure , works decently to partition the system dynamics into regions of similar behavior .",
    "stretch - gap performs well as a discriminator that groups states into these regions in a way similar to spectral analysis for detecting community structure in networks @xcite . to wit",
    ", stretch drops between zero and four states within any basin or overlap , but drops four to eighteen states crossing a boundary ( in this example ) .",
    "this is not completely reliable , of course , but for many systems this simple technique may provide all the information required ; and it may be the best one can do with available data .",
    "@xmath151 has a stretch of 21 , @xmath152 has a stretch of 6 , and @xmath153 has a stretch of 2 .",
    "there are 33 states in this system so the stretch - gaps of @xmath154 and @xmath155 are 45.45% and 12.12% respectively .",
    "that means that 45.45% fewer of the system s states can be reached after the @xmath155 transition .",
    "we can also use this to determine the stretch - gap of @xmath156 as 57.58% regardless of the particular path taken .",
    "only the start and end states stretches are necessary to calculate this , but the result is always equal to the sum of the stretch gaps of each transition taken .    let s compare these figures to the criticality of the same transitions .",
    "the criticality of @xmath154 is 0.714 and the criticality of @xmath155 is 0.667 .",
    "that means that the system only has 71.5% of the possible future states in state @xmath152 as it did in @xmath151 .",
    "a composite measure is also possible for the criticality of @xmath156 .",
    "it can be calculated just using the start and end states stretches , using the standard percentage of a percentage of a percentage @xmath0 calculation .",
    "so the criticality of @xmath157    these measures above are intended to be just rough measures useful in certain limited contexts and when information about the system is limited .",
    "for starters , these measures only consider only the structure of the markov models , not the probabilities .",
    "also , they apply to transitions rather than states .",
    "[ statecriticality ] the _ criticality _ of a * state * is the probabilistically weighted sum of the criticality of all the transitions from that state .",

    ". this convention will be used throughout - including cases where limiting an operation to neighbors matters . ]",
    "because by definition [ probability ] the sum of the probabilities sum to one , state criticality will also be a scale - free measure with values between zero and one .",
    "all these criticality measures quantify the constriction of future possibilities on a state - by - state basis which is useful if we want  to keep our options open \" . as we will see later",
    "that is sometimes exactly what we want to measure , but sometimes we will want to measure system dynamics with reference to some particular features and that is what the following definitions for tipping points allow us to measure .      as a refinement of levers from definition [ levers ] we can apply the lever concept to critical states to identify another feature of system dynamics .",
    "[ criticallever ] a state has a _",
    "critical lever _ if a change in that aspect ( or those aspects ) of the state will reduce the reach .",
    "this merely combines the concept of a lever with the concept of critical behavior ( definition [ criticalbehavior ] ) .",
    "by looking more deeply at the aspects driving the state changes and calculating the magnitude and strength of different critical levers we can gain a better understanding of how microfeatures generate the macrobehavior of the model .      as mentioned in the section introduction",
    ", the common feature of the measures in this section is that some states or transitions mark a shift in the properties of a system s dynamics . for the criticality measures above the difference",
    "was the number of reachable states .",
    "the following measures generalize to any sets distinguished by a chosen characteristic .",
    "given states exhaustively compartmentalized by the property ( or properties ) of interest the following techniques can find where shifts occur and measure their magnitude .      for some models we are interested in the achievement of a particular state ( e.g. an equilibrium ) or a particular system behavior ( e.g. a path linking two states ) .",
    "we denote the particular state ( or set ) of interest as the _ reference state _ ( or _ reference set _ ) .",
    "below we will see examples of specific reference states ( e.g. attractors and functional states ) but first the general case .",
    "there are many ways in which behavior may change with respect to a reference state or set ( e.g. probability of reaching it , probability of returning to it , or probability of visiting an intermediate state ) : each property may partition the states into different equivalence classes ( groups with the same value of the property ) .",
    "it is the movement between equivalence classes that counts as tipping behavior .",
    "a _ tipping point _ is a state which is in the perimeter of an equivalence class for some property .",
    "recall from definition [ perimeter ] that perimeter states are those from which the system s dynamics can leave the specified set .",
    "because the sets here are determined by the properties of system behavior leaving a set implies a change in that behavioral property - and that is a tip .",
    "this definition does not preclude that the system could tip back into a previously visited set : that possibility depends on what property is establishing the equivalence classes .",
    "[ climatechange1 ] a climate change model that relates the co@xmath159 content of the atmosphere to global temperature may have states that are grouped together according to a shared property of those states ( e.g. sea level , precipitation , glacial coverage ) . due to feedback mechanisms in the system it is likely the case that these qualitative features change in punctuated equilibria ( see also example [ punctuatedequilibria ] ) thus producing equivalence classes for some states of the system . _",
    "ex hypothesi _ people can manipulate the level of co@xmath159 to higher or lower values .",
    "the values at which the property shifts happen may differ for the increasing and decreasing directions , but the point is that co@xmath159 levels could raise temperatures to the point where glaciers disappear and then later lower past the point where glaciers will form again .",
    "for some systems behavior can tip out of a equivalence class and then later tip back in .",
    "phase transitions in condensed matter physics are another example of reversible tipping behavior .",
    "so while some have posited that tipping points are points of no return for system behavior , that turns out to be true only for certain systems and is not properly part of the definition .",
    "dynamics of staying , leaving , returning , and avoiding a specified set of states will be covered in the section below on robustness . here",
    "we continue with ways to quantify changes in what is possible for system dynamics for different states and transitions .",
    "these measures apply for any reference state or reference set , but for convenience and intuition pumping the following presentation will adopt the notation of attractor ( @xmath77 ) for a reference state and set and @xmath78 for a collection of reference states . recall from definition [ attractor ] that attractors may be equilibria or orbits and both possibilities were symbolized with @xmath77 and treated as singular .",
    "that convention will be continued here .",
    "@xmath78 is a collection of independent reference states and sets each of which satisfies a property while @xmath77 may be a set of states that collectively satisfies a particular dynamical property ( such as an orbit as a whole satisfies the dynamical property of an equilibrium ) .",

    "the energy level of any state @xmath28 is the number of attractors in @xmath107 . by theorem [ decreasingreach ] for any @xmath165 .",
    "this decreasing reach property implies @xmath166 since the end state of a transition always has a lower or equal energy level , @xmath167 is always greater than or equal to zero .",
    "we now can measure the degree to which a state is likely to be the site of a tip ( in a similar fashion to definition [ statecriticality ] of state criticality above ) .",

    "thus the upper bound of @xmath28 s tippiness goes to 1 as @xmath176 .",
    "note that tippiness uses the ratio of energies rather than the difference ; this makes tippiness a dimensionless metric and thus comparable across any state or system . sometimes one will be more interested in minimizing the magnitude of energy drops , or avoiding states with the highest expected magnitude of energy drops , which have obvious formulations given the above definitions .      as another refinement of levers from definition [ levers ]",
    "we can apply the lever concept to tipping points to relate tips to the individual aspect changes that drive them .",
    "[ tippinglever ] a state has a _ tipping lever _ with respect to some specified set of states if a change in that aspect ( or those aspects ) of the state will take the system out of that set of states .",
    "this merely combines the concept of a lever with the general concept of tipping behavior .",
    "so while every state accept equilibria has levers , only perimeter states have critical levers . identifying the tipping levers of certain sets of states is precisely what we d like a `` tipping point '' analysis to reveal because it is just the aspects of a tipping point that actually change when the system tips out of a set of states .",
    "these ideas are further refined in the analysis of robustness and related concepts below .",
    "this section will use the markov model framework provided above to establish formal definitions of several related concepts : robust , sustainable , resilient , recoverable , stable , and static ; as well as their counterparts : susceptible , vulnerable , fragile , and collapsible . as before , it is unlikely that any mathematically precise definition will maintain all the nuances of the full concept sharing the same name .",
    "furthermore , existing definitions and formal treatments of the same concepts or that use the same terms risk distracting from or confusing the thrusts of this research .",
    "what is more important than the terms used is that the definition is useful and we can easily refer to it , though some care has been spent on finding the closest word to the provided definition .    adding to the ambiguous and often synonymous usage of these terms are the conceptual questions that arise in considering their dispositional nature .",
    "dispositional properties are philosophically troubling for many reasons but the philosophical troubles will not interfere with their definition and ascription here ( mostly these stem from the question of whether their subjunctive conditional status distinguishes them from categorical properties ) .",
    "i mention this here because i want to hint that in addition to the obvious and direct application of this methodology to improve the performance capabilities of systems , it may also produce insights into the nature of dispositional properties in general .",
    "this analysis reveals how these particular dispositional properties are behavioral in nature and emerge from the microbehavior of the system components .",
    "the philosophical issues will be addressed in separate work ( see future work subsection below ) , but it may be interesting to the reader to consider how to apply the following methodology to investigate other dispositional properties such as soluble , malleable , affordable , and differentiate them from other types of properties with the much sought after necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "the measures in this first set are conceptually simple with intuitive mathematical definitions and straightforward algorithms .",
    "they nevertheless identify important features of system dynamics and act as building blocks for more sophisticated measures .",
    "[ statestability ] a * state s * _ stability _ is how likely that state is to self - transition . @xmath28",
    "s stability is @xmath177    while this may seems a trivial property , it is consistent with a useful distinction from system dynamics : the difference between stable and unstable equilibria . due to the resolution of the markov model s states",
    ", an attractor state will include a neighborhood of aspect values around the equilibrium point values .",
    "thus exit behavior from the attractor node includes the response to small perturbations to ( or variations around ) the equilibrium point values .",
    "stable states will tend to stay within this neighborhood and this is reflected in a high self transition probability value . since values that are nearby an unstable equilibrium but not exactly on the equilibrium point values will tend to move away from the equilibrium values , we would see this reflected in low self - transition probabilities .",
    "these results exactly match attributions of stability and instability in the markov model via definition [ statestability ]    we can extend stability to apply to sets of states in the obvious way .",
    "[ setstability ] the _ stability _ of a * set * is the probability that the system will not transition out of the set given that the system starts within the set .",
    "we calculate this as the average of the individual states exit probabilities , so set stability is @xmath178    this is a crude measure because is does nt properly reflect the probability of staying within the set over time , it only looks one time period ahead . a more sophisticated notion of staying within a set of states",
    "is presented by definition [ sustainability ] below of sustainability , but in some cases ( discussed in that subsection ) the two measures generate the same value .    the word ` static ' is often used to indicate a lack of dynamics in a system , and that is the sense attached to the following formal definition . recalling that self - transitions can be interpreted as a lack of transition it aggregates the lack of transitions among states .",
    "[ static ] the degree to which a set is _",
    "static _ is the average of the states stability values : @xmath179    this definition , though simple , captures how likely a system is to be in the same state for consecutive time steps in a way that is comparable across sets and systems with different numbers of states .",
    "what this definition fails to capture is that sets with equilibria will spend an infinite amount of time in them whereas sets lacking equilibria will continue to transition for eternity ( even if that s within an attractor ) ; and yet because this measure uses average stability it is easy to construct cases where an equilibrating systems has a lower static level on the given definition .",
    "static and stable set measurements are similar in their calculation but distinct in their sense .",
    "set stability is a measurement of lack of change , but it is a lack of change out of a set ( though it ignores dynamics that stay with in the set ) .",
    "it is therefore only applicable if the set chosen is smaller than the whole system .",
    "staticness can apply to the whole system and is useful for comparing systems overall level of dynamism .    if @xmath180 ( i.e. a set with one state )",
    "then the static measurement equals the stability measurement .",
    "this theorem clearly follows from the fact that the sum of transitions staying within a set equals the sum of self - transitions for a set of one state .",
    "also in this case set stability naturally equals state stability because the set is a state .    for any set , the set stability measure is always greater than or equal to the level of staticness .    for any given @xmath84 , the set stability measure is @xmath181 the probability of transferring to another state in @xmath45",
    ", @xmath182 is greater than or equal to zero .",
    "if that equals zero then @xmath28 s contribution to set stability becomes @xmath183 which is equal to @xmath28 s contribution to the static measure . if @xmath184 for any @xmath185 then @xmath45 s set stability is greater than its degree of being static .",
    "on the other end of the spectrum as stability and staticness are measures of how likely the system is to change states . because the above measures are defined in terms of probabilities , most simple measures of the presence of dynamics can be calculated as one minus the appropriate measure above .",
    "there is one additional simple measure to present here ; it is a rough measure of how predictable state changes are .",
    "the _ turbulence _ of a set is the average percentage of states that its states can transition into .",
    "we can calculate @xmath45 s turbulence with the average ratio of each state s degree to the number of states in @xmath45 : @xmath186    this measure ranges from zero to one where the zero case occurs as @xmath187 and a turbulence of one means that the set is fully connected ( including self - transitions for each state ) .",
    "the idea is that when each state has only a few possible transitions then there are far fewer possible paths through the system dynamics .",
    "if each state can transition into many others then , like with the common usage of ` turbulent ' , there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path that a series of transitions will take . plotting the degree distribution would reveal a set s ( which might be the whole system or just a portion ) turbulence profile .",
    "if one were to find something like a power - law distribution ( where a few states have many transitions and most have just a few transitions ) the high - degree states would seem to satisfy yet another concept of tipping behavior . combining turbulence profiling with ( for example ) the identification of perimeter states could be used to classify systems by the dynamical properties ( see future work section for more details ) .",
    "though the turbulence measure may provide sufficient information in many systems , it fails to differentiate the effects of high and low probability transitions .",
    "transition weights clearly play a role in determine how confident one can be that a particular trajectory will be taken rather than another .",
    "for example , if all but one of a state s transitions have very small probabilities associated with them then the set should be considerable less turbulent than if all the transitions are equally probable .",
    "[ weightedturbulence ] as a refinement of turbulence , _ weighted turbulence _ of the state @xmath28 equals zero if @xmath188 and for @xmath189 can be calculated as @xmath190    because by definition [ probability ] the sum of exit probabilities sum to one , the average of the exit probabilities is @xmath191 regardless of the number and their individual weights .",
    "the innermost component of this calculation , therefore , finds the difference between each transition and the average weight and squares it .",
    "squaring has the dual effect of producing an absolute value and intensifying differences ; the intensification is not crucial and is merely adopted by convention . because turbulence is maximal when each weight is equal , we subtract the differences from one to calculate each state s turbulence .",
    "case is that the definition produces a value of one instead of zero .",
    "this is an artifact of the fact that if there is only one edge then all the edges have a weight equal to the average weight - and that is the case that produces maximal turbulence for all other @xmath192s . ]",
    "to determine the weighted turbulence of a set we simply average each included state s weighted turbulence      in common parlance something is sustainable if it can perpetually maintain its operation , function , or existence .",
    "it is often used in connection to environmental considerations such as whether humans are using up resources faster than they can be replenished or to the ecological question of whether population dynamics will drive any species to extinction .",
    "political institutions , academic reading groups , pools of workers , and any other system that undergoes inflows and outflows of its parts and might collapse or fail is a potential subject for sustainability considerations .    roughly speaking , for this analysis a set of states is sustainable if the system can stay within that set of states .",
    "there are multiple ways to calculate a measure of this sort and each reports a slightly different concept of sustainability .",
    "as a crude approximation to the long - term sustainability we can find the cumulative sum of the @xmath193 power of the set stability measure from definition [ setstability ] up to some sufficiently large @xmath58 ( see observation [ bigenough ] below ) .",
    "we could call such a measure _ naive sustainability _ and identify conditions for its appropriate application , but instead we will move on to a more sophisticated measure .",
    "the previous measure is crude because within a set there may be ( for example ) heavily weighted cycles such that if the system starts in one of the cycle - states it is very likely to go around the cycle for a long period . to properly account for this , while still remaining agnostic over",
    "which state of @xmath45 the system starts in , we calculate a refined sustainability measure .",
    "[ sustainability ] the _ sustainability _ of @xmath45 is the average cumulative long - term probability density of future states that remain in the set starting from each state in the set .",

    "this is done each time to clear out the probability mass outside the set so that it ca nt return .",
    "the result is the sum of the resulting vectors for the states in @xmath45 each step .",
    "usually algorithms are been banished to the appendix , but understanding this calculation is likely to make understanding definition [ susceptible ] of susceptibility much clearer . ]",
    "[ bigenough ] if the chosen set does not contain an attractor then this calculation is unproblematic because some probability density `` escapes '' the set each iteration and there exists some time @xmath58 after which the remaining probability density in each state of @xmath45 is less than any arbitrarily chosen minimum resolution .",
    "sustainability measurements are therefore only appropriate for sets that do not include attractors . if an application to sets including attractors were deemed useful then we could separate out the basin(s ) of the attractor(s ) from the other states and apply the sustainability measure above to the remaining states of the set .",
    "it is still not clear how to recombine the two subsets into a single measure or how to cope with epistemic barriers to knowing whether a set contains an attractor before running the analysis and thus whether this would be necessary . because sustainability is a cumulative measure the calculation will not produce a probability .",
    "but because the cumulative sum is divided by the size of @xmath45 it is normalized and comparable across differently sized sets . what we uncover through this process is a measure of the expectation over time that the system will stay in the set given that the system starts somewhere in it .",
    "if @xmath45 is chosen to be an energy plateau then all exit transitions are one - way .",
    "if there are no cycles in @xmath45 then the probability mass will quickly dissipate from within @xmath45 yielding a very low sustainability measure .",
    "if there is at least one cycle then there is a chance that the system will stay within the set indefinitely , but since that cycle can not be an attractor the system will leave the set in expectation .",
    "the stronger the weights of the transitions among the cycle states the greater the sustainability measure .",
    "the energy plateau application is especially helpful for the `` keep our options open '' mindset and where each equilibria is a different form of system failure ( e.g. for dissipative structures ) .",
    "it can even be useful to calculate the sustainability of a basin of attraction ( excluding the attractor itself ) - which is also an energy plateau .",
    "the system may exhibit interesting and long - lived behavior within a basin of attraction that may reveal much more about the processes affecting a system than just which attractor it is likely to end up in .",
    "time to equilibria may be on the galactic time - scale and knowing that will alter our interpretation of the system s characteristics .    the term ` susceptible ' is typically followed by ` to ' and an indication of what the thing is susceptible to .",
    "i preserve that usage with the measure presented here .",
    "we will talk of sets being susceptible and sets can be defined according to different properties for different applications .",
    "states are what sets are susceptible to .",
    "this may sound odd , but the probability of transitioning out of a set depends on which state within the set the system is currently in .",
    "so the characteristic represented by staying within a set risks being lost to a degree contingent upon the state .

    ". then one would calculate how susceptibility that set is to each state ( or smaller collection of states ) . using this information the autopilot and/or pilot could select actions that minimize susceptibility across the states visited and this means maximizing the probability of staying within the set of autopilot capable states .",
    "this example can be generalized to any case where maintaining functionality is the modeler s goal .",

    "the resilience of @xmath28 equals @xmath198    it is the sum of the individual probabilities of returning in @xmath199 time steps . because the sum of exit probabilities of every state equals one and the probability of traversing a path is the product of the states along the path this cumulative sum is always less than or equal to one and is a true probability measure .",
    "[ fragility ] a state s _ fragility _ is a measure of how likely it is that the system will never return to that state .",

    "no transition can be to a higher energy level .",
    "hence if a system transitions out of an energy plateau then it can never transition back into it .",
    "if the system can not transition back into the set @xmath45 then by definition [ setresilience ] @xmath45 s resilience is zero .",
    "the susceptibility measure determines how sustainability changes depending on the specific starting state . we may wish to have a similar measure for resilience that reports how likely the system dynamics are to return to a state given that it exits via a particular transition .",
    "[ recoverable ] a transition out of the set is _ recoverable _ to the degree that the system will return to the set after the transition .",
    "@xmath45 is recoverable from @xmath59 to the degree calculated by @xmath206    note that leaving via a particular transition is the same as exiting due to a particular lever change .",
    "thus we can uncover the recoverability of a set of lever points ( from definition [ leverpoint ] ) for a particular aspect as the average of the recoverability of each transition in it . also note that there may be multiple paths from @xmath28 back into each @xmath203 of @xmath45 .",

    "they can be ranked by their seriousness .",
    "such a ranking can guide both the pilot in adjusting to the failure and the autopilot to avoid it in the first place .",

    "sustainability measures the likelihood of a system s dynamic s staying in a certain set given that it starts within that set and resilience measures how likely it is to return to the set if the dynamics leave the set , but these measures do not include the case where the system s state starts outside the set and then enters it . when the set of interest is an energy plateau resilience is always zero ( as shown by theorem [ resilienceiszero ] ) but the set may still receive probability mass from parts of the system with higher energy levels . and in cases where a non - equilibrium analysis is appropriate we might be comparing different subsets within an energy plateau ( e.g. the relative probability mass of two cores within the mantle of an energy plateau - see example [ punctuatedequilibria ] below ) . in this final subsection",
    "the above measures will culminate in the most inclusive measures of system robustness .    before defining the measure that allows for inflow , we first define a measure that combines the features of sustainability and reliability .    [ reliable ]",

    "@xmath207    this measure combines the concepts of sustainability and resilience , but it is not just the sum of those two measures . reliability starts the flow in the set and calculates the probability of being in each state on each consecutive time step . it does restrict the probability mass summation to the specified set , but it tracks probability mass throughout the system . the reason that this is nt merely a sum of resilience and sustainability is because when combining those two it was not possible to track probability mass that leaves the set , cycles back into the set , and then circulates within the set ( and maybe even repeats this process ) . with reliability",
    "we can reincorporate probability flow that leaves and then re - enters the set .",
    "a characteristic captured by the chosen set is reliable if it can be maintained or , if lost , can be regained .",
    "if @xmath45 is an energy plateau then @xmath45 s reliability equals @xmath45 s sustainability .",
    "this theorem does not follow directly from theorem [ resilienceiszero ] because there is no direct link between resilience and reliability , but the reasoning is the same . because there can not be any paths leading out of an energy plateau back into it , all the probability mass that @xmath45 gets for the reliability measure is from the initial distribution . leaving mass",
    "never returns so that produces an equivalent measure as not counting the returning mass : this is the sustainability measure .",
    "hence the sustainability values in figure [ sustainabilityfigure ] are also those energy plateaus reliability values .    finally we add to the reliability measure the possibility that the system did not start in the set , but transitions into it .",
    "[ robust ] the _ robustness _ of a set is the average cumulative long - term probability density over the states in the set given that the system may start at any state .",
    "robust characteristics not only have high retaining power and recoverability , they also draw the system in from states outside the characteristic set . sets with high robustness values are sets that the system s dynamics tends towards .",
    "that description makes robust sets sound a lot like attractors ; and this is as we would expect .",
    "attractors will typically have high robustness measures on account of their perfect sustainability and the fact that typically several states will lead into them . ) or a proper subset of an attractor . ]",
    "the attractor - like behavior related to robust sets provides interesting and useful insights into many systems dynamics .",
    "[ punctuatedequilibria ] sets that behave like ( and are defined as ) equilibria in other modeling techniques may be revealed to be highly robust sets under the current analysis .",
    "the phenomena of _ punctuated equilibria _ describes a system that spends long periods of time in characteristic patterns with interspersed and short - lived periods of rapid change . in the markov model representation",
    "we might see a mantle of an energy plateau with multiple highly robust cores .",
    "these cores could have relatively short transition paths among them .",
    "each is a different cohesive pattern with larger probabilities of staying in than going out .",
    "but because these cores are not attractors the system will eventually transition out of them and into the next core .",
    "[ dissipativestructure ] one of the foci of complex systems science is the study of the self - maintaining ( or _ autopoietic _ ) nature of dissipative structures .",
    "dissipative structures are those where a continual flow of energy , matter , or other resource is necessary to maintain system structure and performance .",
    "biological systems are like this , constantly changing and adapting to maintain functionality , and so are many other complex systems .",

    "and like the above measures of tipping- and robustness - related concepts , these measures apply to markov models representing either observational or model - generated data .",

    "in either case we might care less about where the system goes than how it gets there , i.e. which intermediate states the system realizes between two anchor states .",
    "we might care about the exact path our dynamics takes through the system s states because some states are preferred to others ( for exogenous reasons ) or because they have different dynamical properties ( e.g. susceptibility or vulnerability measures ) .",

    "achieving this goal will require solving issues with the choice of system resolution and `` playing with '' the resolution to find the matching patterns . though this may sound suspicious , changing the resolution is nothing more than altering the level of organization to which we are applying the properties .",
    "as long as we are consistent in our application of these techniques then we may be able to discover similarities in many complex systems dynamics .",
    "there are two potential non - trivial objections to the above - given probabilistic accounts of properties of system dynamics .",
    "the first is that probabilistic definitions are inadequate because we aim to understand these features as properties that systems possess rather than dynamics they _ might _ have . to answer this question",
    "we may first need a better grasp of dispositional versus categorical properties more generally ( see below ) .",
    "but it may be the case the other definitions cashed out purely in terms of structural properties of markov models may be what some people would find more intuitive .",
    "it could also be that the definitions these potential objectors are seeking can not be formulated within markov models at all .",
    "as long as the above definitions reveal useful distinctions and patterns of system behavior the project was a success , but still better ( or at least different and also useful ) measures may be available if build from a different formal foundation .",
    "i will , naturally , continue to pursue other and hugely different measures of system dynamics .",
    "the other objection to the probabilistic definitions provided is that a person may insist that for many of these concepts the definition is incomplete without the causal explanation for how it comes about",
    ". like all other statistics - like approaches ( see `` metastatistics '' below ) these measures may be realized by many different micro - level dynamics .",
    "some of those dynamics may not seem proper candidates for robustness or tipping behavior even if the data they generate reveals it as such from this analysis .",
    "but if this were to happen then i would consider the project a huge success",
    ". this would be similar to discovering scale - free degree distributions in many different networks from disparate research fields .",
    "finding that common property urged researchers to pursue more deeply the phenomena and they eventually uncovered several different mechanisms by which scale - free network may be created .",
    "our understanding of each of those systems greatly increased because we had a common yardstick with which to measure them .",
    "the probabilistic measures presented here are not intended to replace or make unnecessary the deeper scientific analysis - they are supposed to foster it .      while working on the formal definitions of robustness - related properties i realized that these are all dispositional properties ; and dispositional properties constitute a long - standing philosophical problem .",
    "that connection immediately made me wonder if my mathematical formalism might shed some new light on how to differentiate dispositional properties from categorical ones .",
    "dispositional properties are philosophically troubling for many reasons , but primarily these stem from the question of whether their subjunctive conditional status distinguishes them from categorical properties",
    ". it may therefore be interesting to consider how to apply my methodology to investigate other dispositional properties such as soluble , malleable , affordable , and differentiate them from other properties with accepted necessary and sufficient conditions . if in addition to the obvious and direct application of this methodology to improve the performance capabilities of systems my research also produces insights into the nature of dispositional properties in general that would be unanticipated but certainly welcome news .",
    "let s look at some details of the problem .",
    "a big part of the problem is that any property can be given a subjunctive conditional description , but a property would be dispositional if and only if such a definition is the only possible one .",
    "color properties are known as primary properties and should be excellent candidates of clear - cut categorical properties . yet being red is dispositional in the sense that nothing seems red in the dark . whether or not redness ( or conductive , or triangular , or @xmath0 ) is dispositional in the same way that fragility is has not been solved .",
    "my mathematical analysis reveals how particular dispositional properties ( robustness - related ones ) are behavioral in nature and emerge from the microbehavior of the system components .",
    "what i hope is that this can be expanded to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for properties to be dispositional in different ways @xmath0 or at least a step in a helpful direction .",
    "i have said elsewhere in this paper that i consider the methodology presented here to be similar in kind to statistics .",
    "it starts with data ( perhaps generated from simulations of a model ) , fits a model ( a markov model ) to the data , and then purports to describe the real system with measures over that model ( my definitions ) .",
    "statistics as we usually see it takes a different kind of model ( some form of distribution or estimator ) , but its purpose and general method of attack are very similar",
    ". and this procedure is clearly different from other sorts of models in that neither standard statistics nor my methodology can explain the phenomena being analyzed . statistics ( and my methodology ) can produce evidence that some generative theory - driven model does explain the observed data , but the theory behind the generative model is what is doing the explaining .",
    "standard statistics and my methodology are certainly not unique in their abilities to measure but not explain phenomena .",
    "much of complex network analysis can be seen in this light as well .",
    "the network representation facilitates the calculation of measures on the generating data but not because the links identified in the network representation are in the actual system s features .",
    "classifier systems , bayes nets , hidden markov models , and neural nets are all further examples where the formal representation can permit measures and produce predictions without mirroring the structure and dynamics of the underlying behavior - generating system . seeing all these different techniques under the same metastatistical light may allow us to 1 ) bridge gaps among these techniques , 2 ) identify broader guidelines for the proper application and interpretation of these techniques , and 3 ) find new statistics - like techniques with desired features .",
