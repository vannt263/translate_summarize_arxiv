    "the study of optomechanical systems ( oms ) has undergone rapid development over the recent years @xcite .",
    "the quantum level of oms has been reached in experiments @xcite .",
    "entanglement is a particularly striking quantum feature .",
    "the coupling of the cavity field of an oms to the mechanical oscillator under radiation pressure can lead to their entanglement .",
    "this mesoscopic or macroscopic entanglement possesses both fundamental interest and potential applications .",
    "theoretically an oms is often approached via the expansion of its fluctuations about the mean values of the cavity and mechanical mode operators , where these mean values are determined by the classical equations of motion .",
    "this approximation of replacing a quantum system operator with the sum of a classical value and the accompanying quantum fluctuation has been widely applied to generic nonlinear quantum systems whose heisenberg - langevin equations are not analytically solvable @xcite .",
    "most previous studies of optomechanical entanglement ( see , e.g. vitali , pater , vitali-07,vitali-08 , h - p-08 , galve , zou , abdi , g ) concern that of the fluctuations around the steady state solution of the classical langevin equations under continuous - wave ( cw ) drive . some other works have considered the entanglement under periodic @xcite or pulsed drive @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these treatments is that the linearized dynamics about the fluctuations is based on a specific classical mean motion as the background , and the entanglement of the fluctuations can be closely connected to the classical motion of oms @xcite .",
    "however , the classical motion of an oms can be chaotic @xcite , so it is not always possible to quantify this entanglement of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "very recently several quantum features of oms have been studied in considerable detail .",
    "this research includes oms dynamics under single photon drive @xcite , control and generation of oms quantum states @xcite , enhancement of oms nonlinearity for quantum information processing @xcite and other quantum properties of oms @xcite .",
    "these studies consider the quantum states associated with the cavity mode @xmath0 and mechanical mode @xmath1 themselves , as in fig . 1 , instead of those for their fluctuations . starting from a separable quantum state of the cavity and mechanical mode , the optomechanical coupling can entangle them to an entangled quantum state .",
    "the less unexplored entanglement of such fully quantum oms , which is independent from classical motion , is the theme to be discussed below .",
    "notice that this type of entanglement was also recently discussed in a different approach @xcite , which works with the numerical simulation based on the approximate fokker - planck equation to find the entanglement signature and other properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the dynamics about the oms in strong drive and weak coupling regime . in this regime the quantum states of an oms keep to be gaussian . the real - time evolution and quantum noise effect on the entanglement of such gaussian states are studied with examples in sec .",
    "then we present a rather detailed discussion about the difference between our concerned entanglement and that of the cavity and mechanical fluctuation in sec .",
    "the conclusions from our study are given in the final section .",
    "we consider an oms driven by a pulsed drive with the central frequency @xmath2 and arbitrary frequency distribution @xmath3 .",
    "its profile @xmath4 in time domain is related to @xmath5 by the fourier transform .",
    "the drive reduces to a cw one when @xmath6 is constant . without cavity and mechanical damping , one has the unitary evolution operator @xmath7 for the oms , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) describes the cavity and mechanical oscillation with their frequency @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 inside the time - ordered exponential is the system hamiltonian in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath13 , which is obtained by the transformation @xmath14 on the hamiltonian @xmath15 of the oms . in the above equation , @xmath16 is the optomechanical coupling constant , and @xmath17 is the detuning of the drive s central frequency from the cavity frequency .",
    "the dimensionless mechanical coordinate operator and mechanical momentum operator are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the cavity ( mechanical ) damping at the rate @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) can be described in terms of a linear coupling between the cavity ( mechanical ) mode with the stochastic langevin noise operator @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) of the reservoir @xcite : @xmath24 the associated noises are assumed to be the white ones satisfying @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) with the respective quanta number @xmath27 in thermal equilibrium .",
    "such approximation is valid for the mechanical reservoir given the quality factor @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "because the system - reservoir coupling in ( [ hd ] ) takes its form in the interaction picture with respect to the total self oscillation hamiltonian of both system and reservoir , it should be added into the time - ordered exponential @xmath29 in the interaction picture to construct the evolution operator @xmath30 for the combination of the oms and its associated reservoirs ( its momentary action @xmath31 gives the exact langevin equation and master equation of the oms ) @xcite .",
    "the development of the entanglement between the cavity and mechanical mode is closely connected to the dynamical evolution of these modes .",
    "their evolution under @xmath32 involves three non - commutative processes  cavity drive , optomechanical coupling and dissipation , so it is impossible to solve the system dynamics directly from this joint evolution operator . our method to reduce the intricacy",
    "is factorizing it into numerous ones corresponding to relatively tractable processes @xcite . here",
    "we apply the technique to find a factorization that is suitable to study the dynamically evolving gaussian states .",
    "our factorization is obtained as @xmath33where @xmath34 ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the first operator @xmath35 for the pure cavity drive process takes the form @xmath36with @xmath37 being the sum of the decayed cavity mode operator and the colored cavity noise operator @xmath38 .",
    "the third evolution operator is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a linear combination of the mechanical operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 from @xmath43 and @xmath44 . to the first order of the optomechanical coupling constant @xmath16 ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the process @xmath45 of optomechanical coupling is @xmath46where @xmath47e(t^{\\prime } ) e^{i\\delta _ { 0}t^{\\prime } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the effective hamiltonian in ( [ lom ] ) , the oms evolves according to the following differential equations : which evolves the cavity and mechanical mode in terms of the following differential equations : @xmath48the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) terms on the right side of ( [ om ] ) are due to the beam - splitter ( bs ) action in the quadratic hamiltonian ( lom ) , and the @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) terms reflect the coexisting squeezing ( sq ) action .    next we start with an initial oms state @xmath51 in thermal equilibrium with the environment , i.e. @xmath51 is a gaussian state as the product of a cavity vacuum and a finite temperature mechanical thermal state .",
    "this initial state becomes entangled under optomechanical coupling .",
    "its evolution can be studied by successively acting each factor in the factorized form @xmath52 of the joint evolution operator @xmath53 on the total initial state @xmath54 , in which @xmath55 denotes the reservoir state in thermal equilibrium with @xmath56 .",
    "one has @xmath57 since , under thermal equilibrium , the system - reservoir coupling in ( [ hd ] ) does not change the state @xmath51 ( see appendix b for details ) , and @xmath58 also keeps @xmath59 invariant because @xmath60 for the combined initial vacuum state @xmath61 of the cavity and its zero temperature reservoir .",
    "thus the expectation values of system operators @xmath62 reduce to the following trace over system and reservoir degrees of freedom ( see appendix b for details ) : @xmath63 in weak coupling regime where the hamiltonian of @xmath64 takes the form in ( [ lom ] ) , the evolved oms is preserved to be in gaussian state , because the state @xmath65 of the evolved oms is only determined by the quadratic hamiltonian in @xmath64 and the displacement hamiltonian in @xmath66 .",
    "the entanglement of the evolved gaussian states can be quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "one should consider the correlation matrix ( cm ) with the elements @xmath68where @xmath69 , for the calculation of @xmath70 ( see appendix c for details ) .",
    "each entry of the cm can be calculated following ( [ main ] ) with @xmath71 , etc .",
    "we first illustrate the real - time evolution of oms entanglement under the cw drives of different detuning .",
    "the first example we present in fig .",
    "2 is the entanglement evolution under blue detuned cw drives .",
    "the entanglement values measured by @xmath70 become stable with time and , at the sq resonant point @xmath72 , the steady entanglement reaches the maximum . unlike the stationary entanglement between the fluctuations @xmath73 and @xmath74 under a sq resonant drive , which is upper bounded by @xmath75 due to the limitation of classical steady state conditions ( see eq .",
    "( [ condi ] ) below ) @xcite , the evolved entanglement between the cavity mode @xmath0 and mechanical mode @xmath1 themselves can be well beyond this limit ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . compared with the blue detuned regime , the entanglement of the red detuned regime shown in fig . 3 is lower .",
    "this reflects the difference of the bs action from the sq action in creating the optomechanical entanglement .",
    "the exact degree of entanglement is determined by two competitive factors  the direct bs and sq action on the initial quantum state @xmath76 of oms , and the noise drives depending on the drive detuning and intensity .",
    "given a cw drive , the noise drive terms in ( [ om ] ) are magnified by the functions with the modulo @xmath77 , indicating their more significant effect at a small detuning @xmath78 or with a stronger drive intensity @xmath79 . in what follows , we illustrate the noise effect as a function of time and of different system parameters .",
    "first , the entanglement for some values of detuning in figs . 2 and 3 will die at a finite time .",
    "the phenomenon that entanglement is killed by noise in this way is known as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite .",
    "the system evolution according to ( [ om ] ) provides a model in which the esd for the continuous variable states is caused by the colored noises ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 and their conjugates on the right side of ( [ om ] ) ) rather than the white noises in many other examples ( see the references in @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation the noise effect can be so significant that this type of esd happens while the optomechanical coupling exists all the time .",
    "interestingly , the entanglement under some drives , e.g. @xmath82 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , can also revive from time to time during evolution .",
    "4 shows the magnitude of the noise correction to optomechanical entanglement in the system parameter space .",
    "given the same drive intensities , the relations between the entanglement and drive detuning after sufficiently long interaction time are shown in figs.4(a)-4(b ) . with the increase of cavity drive intensity , the entanglement in a more extended detuning range around the bs resonant point @xmath83 will be eliminated by the quantum noises .",
    "the overall tendency of the entanglement change with the drive intensity for various drive detuning values is described in figs .",
    "4(c)-4(d ) .",
    "the plots in these figures show a competition between the effective coupling @xmath84 and the noise drives [ see the respective terms in ( [ om ] ) ] in affecting the degree of entanglement .",
    "the entanglement reaches the maximum at a certain drive intensity @xmath79 determined by the system parameters , instead of monotonically increasing with @xmath79 which enhances the effective optomechanical coupling . despite the existence of the noises ,",
    "the entanglement in the blue detuned regime can be high .",
    "the sq generated entanglement is also rather robust against temperature ; see the comparison in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) .      finally , in fig . 5",
    ", we provide an example of entanglement evolution for oms driven by a pulse .",
    "pulsed optomechanics is a newly developed research field pulse2 , vanner1 , vanner2 .",
    "here we use gaussian pulses with the width @xmath85 . due to the contribution from a spectrum of frequencies ,",
    "the entanglement for the drives of different central frequency detuning evolves similarly .",
    "another noticeable feature is that , given the same system parameters , the entanglement generated under the pulse could last even longer than that of the cw ones .",
    "this can be explained by the contribution from the frequency components outside the regime , in which the noise effect quickly destroys the corresponding entanglement .",
    "entanglement under pulsed drive was also discussed in the approach based on classical mean motion background @xcite . like in the cw cases ,",
    "our results independent of classical background are consequent upon the dynamics involving a significantly different quantum noise effect .",
    "we are concerned with the regime of strong drive ( @xmath86 ) and weak optomechanical coupling ( @xmath87 ) in the study of gaussian state entanglement for oms . starting from our initial oms quantum state ( the cavity in a vacuum state and the mechanical oscillator in a thermal state )",
    ", such entanglement for the evolved quantum state develops as the optomechanical coupling in fig .",
    "1 starts with the cavity field being built up by an external drive @xmath6 .",
    "meanwhile , the generated entanglement is also weakened or even destroyed by the noise drives . the entanglement in the same regime",
    "was well studied in the fluctuation expansion approach vitali , pater , vitali-07,vitali-08 , h - p-08 , galve , zou , abdi , g. the steady entanglement of the cavity and mechanical fluctuation is based on the classical steady state of oms , the existence of which is determined by routh - hurwitz criterion @xcite in terms of the following inequalities @xcite :    @xmath88[\\kappa ^{2}+\\left ( \\omega _ { m}+\\delta \\right ) ^{2}]+\\gamma _ { m}[(\\gamma _ { m}+2\\kappa )    \\left ( \\kappa ^{2}+\\delta ^{2}\\right ) + 2\\kappa \\omega _ { m}^{2}]\\}+\\delta \\omega _ { m}g^{2}(\\gamma _ { m}+2\\kappa ) ^{2}>0,\\nonumber\\\\ s_{2}&=&\\omega _ { m}\\left ( \\kappa ^{2}+\\delta ^{2}\\right ) -g^{2}\\delta > 0 , \\label{condi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath89 and @xmath90 expressed in terms of the cavity field amplitude @xmath91 as the stationary solution to the langevin equation . the workable regime for the fluctuation expansion approach is depicted with these conditions in fig .",
    "both of the approaches work in the red detuned regime .",
    "7 , however , shows that even in this common regime the entanglement between the fluctuations can be very different from the oms entanglement discussed in this paper .    as we mentioned at the beginning",
    ", the fluctuation expansion approach works with approximating the oms operators with the sum of their mean values following classical dynamics without noise drives and the fluctuations evolving according to quantum mechanics .",
    "then the system operators in the system - reservoir coupling of ( [ hd ] ) are replaced by their fluctuations , so that only delta - function correlated langevin noises @xmath92 and @xmath93 independent of cavity drive detuning and intensity are relevant to the linearized dynamics about the fluctuations and their entanglement .",
    "instead , in our fully quantum approach , the linearized dynamics for the system operators in weak coupling regime involves the magnified noise drives due to the cubic term @xmath94 of the original oms hamiltonian ; see eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) .",
    "the difference of the quantum noise effects is expected to be experimentally tested by the measurement of cavity fluctuation amplitude . as illustrated in fig .",
    "8 , the cavity fluctuations found in the different approaches drastically deviate with drive intensity .",
    "this phenomenon also indicates the distinct quantum states due to the different linearized dynamics .",
    "our concerned oms quantum states and those of the fluctuations around classical steady states can be seen to be different from their cms , which are in one - to - one correspondence to the respective gaussian states .",
    "the entanglement for the evolved states of fully quantum oms can thus significantly differ from that previously considered in the fluctuation expansion approach .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamically generated entanglement of quantum omss that are initially in thermal equilibrium with their environment .",
    "the meaning of our research manifests in two aspects .",
    "first , one sees that high and robust entanglement for fully quantum omss can be generated with blue detuned drive .",
    "in contrast , the previous fluctuation expansion approximation working under the classical steady state condition specifies an upper bound for the entanglement in blue detuned regime and only focuses on the steady entanglement under red detuned drives .",
    "this finding involving the different implementations is important to the related experimental studies on omss entering quantum regime .",
    "second , our fully quantum dynamical approach shows that the noise effect on a quantum oms drastically differs from that affecting the cavity and mechanical fluctuation considered in the previous approach , though the system dynamics is linearized for weak optomechanical coupling in both approaches . in the regime where the magnified noise effect is significant , complicated evolution patterns such as entanglement",
    "sudden death and revival exist for our concerned macroscopic entanglement .",
    "such non - trivial quantum noise effect can also exist in other quantum nonlinear systems .",

    "our discussion is based on the two following factorizations for a unitary evolution operator @xmath95 involving two processes described by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively : @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "the operator @xmath102 is the solution to the differential equations @xmath103 , while @xmath104 is the solution to @xmath105 .",
    "the initial condition for the differential equations is @xmath106 , the identity operator .",

    "here we have used the relation @xmath114 .",
    "we first apply eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) to factorize @xmath115 out of the system - reservoir evolution operator @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are given in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the main text , respectively . in this way one has @xmath119 the cavity mode operator @xmath0 in @xmath117 is transformed to @xmath120 in @xmath121 , and the mechanical mode operator is transformed to @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the transformed operators satisfy the equal - time commutation relation @xmath125=[\\hat{b}(t,\\tau),\\hat{b}^\\dagger(t,\\tau)]=1 $ ] .",
    "then the hamiltonian in the first time - ordered exponential of ( [ one ] ) becomes @xmath126 where @xmath127    by using ( [ a ] ) we factorize out the drive hamiltonian in ( [ ts ] ) as follows : @xmath128 where @xmath129 . in ( [ two ] ) the effect of @xmath130 on the cavity operator",

    "to the first order of @xmath16 , the operation @xmath136 in the first time - ordered exponential of the above equation transforms the mechanical operator as @xmath137 and the cavity operator @xmath131 as @xmath138 the neglected higher order terms in the above expansions are successively lowered by a small factor in the order of @xmath139 , because all terms in the expansions only contain the operators @xmath140 and @xmath141 not magnified by the drive intensity @xmath6 , so the dominant first order contribution leads to the effective optomechanical coupling hamiltonian @xmath142 for the first time - ordered exponential in ( [ three ] ) , which is defined as @xmath143 .",
    "now we have exactly factorized the joint evolution operator as @xmath144",
    "we apply the factorization of the joint evolution operator in ( [ fac ] ) to find the expectation value of a system operator @xmath145 : @xmath146 the action @xmath147 is on the the product of the initial system state @xmath148 and the associate reservoir state @xmath55 in thermal equilibrium with @xmath76 , where @xmath149 is the thermal phonon number at the temperature @xmath150 .",
    "we first look at @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 the second operator of the cavity and vacuum reservoir coupling does not change @xmath154 because @xmath155 for the product state @xmath156 of the cavity vacuum and its associate vacuum reservoir .",
    "if the action of the first operator involving mechanical mode and mechanical reservoir coupling changes the joint initial state @xmath154 , the system state @xmath157 evolved under such coupling will be different from @xmath76 .",
    "the system quantum state @xmath158 is the solution to the master equation @xmath159 in lindblad form @xcite .",
    "the initial state for the above master equation is @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is the thermal quantum number of the reservoir .",
    "here we assume the possible non - equilibrium between system and reservoir , so that @xmath161 could be different from @xmath149 ( in the main text we only consider the situation of thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "this master equation can be exactly solved by the super - operator technique @xcite as @xmath162 if the system and reservoir is in thermal equilibrium , i.e. @xmath163 , the above state will be @xmath164 constantly with time . under this condition , therefore , the operation @xmath165 keeps the joint initial state @xmath154 invariant .",
