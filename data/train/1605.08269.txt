    "quantum mechanics explains many phenomena of nature very well .",

    "because quantum mechanics has the wave - particle duality as its signature property , we further think about the basic concept * particle * : since the wave - particle duality has been successfully applied to ordinary sensible objects like light and matter , considering these ordinary objects ( rather than graviton ) is helpful in understanding the concept of particle .",

    "[ sec : eft - univ ] ) .    to explain that the flat and curved spacetimes @xmath79 and @xmath68 of general relativity are composed of particles , we make a hypothesis that [ grav - hyp ] every   spacetime   manifold   s_gr   of   general   relativity   is   composed   of   _ particles _ , which has the _ meaning _ that [ grav - hyp2 ] & & every   point   p   of   the   gr   spacetime   s_gr   has   a   threedimensional   ( 3d )   spacelike   & & neighborhood   n_space^ 3d(p )   which   is   a    continuum   approximation \"   to   a   discrete & & system   composed   of   particles . since the concepts like substance and shape are basically defined at a constant time , the  3d spacelike neighborhood @xmath105 \" in eq .",

    "next , we consider a question :  is graviton a _",

    "thus , for analysis , we can use an analogy that the substance of the spacetime @xmath56 corresponds to a crystal composed of many lattice atoms . this atomic crystal can experience a large - scale deformation of its lattice . in the quantum - mechanical framework , the lattice deformation of longer wavelengths than the lattice spacing(s )",
    "can be analyzed by introducing a quantized normal mode called the ",
    "phonon \" @xcite .",
    "this bosonic quasi - particle , phonon , differs much in moving range from the lattice atom , which is confined to a small region around its equilibrium position .",
    "if the graviton corresponds to the lattice atom in the above analogy , then ( i ) the graviton ( e.g. , a plane - wave solution moving at the speed of light ) should be confined to a small region like the lattice atom , and ( ii ) there exist collective vibrational motions of many ",
    "lattice gravitons , \" i.e. , the lower - energy excitations corresponding to the phonon in the analogy .",
    "since these two conclusions do not seem plausible , the graviton does not correspond to the lattice atom but to the phonon in the analogy .    therefore , we formulate the  space - quantum hypothesis \" that [ sq - hyp ] & & every   point   p   of   the   gr   spacetime   s_gr   has   a   3d   spacelike   neighborhood   n_space^ 3d(p ) & & which   is   a   continuum   approximation   to   a   discrete   system   * _ syst_*_sq   composed   of   & & particles   called   * space   quanta * , which is the final meaning of the hypothesis in eq .",

    "the graviton is an _",
    "emergent phenomenon _ arising through interactions among space quanta ( see secs .",
    "[ sec : form - met ] and [ sec : eft - univ ] ) , implying each of these space quanta is different and more fundamental than the graviton .",
    "if the substance of every space quantum has a point - like shape , the space quantum is a particle .",
    "however , the point - like shape of the space quantum ( and the other kinds of quanta ) may be only an approximation based on the smallness of its substance compared with the observational precision .",
    "then , the space quantum may be a spatially @xmath109-dimensional object such as a string ( @xmath110 ) , or a composite system made up of two or more objects which interact weakly and/or strongly .",

    "sec : form - met ] and [ sec : eft - univ ] ) .",
    "since the space - quantum hypothesis implies the space part of the gr spacetime @xmath56 is essentially a discrete object , the hypothesis is different from the basic axiom of general relativity that spacetime is a differentiable manifold ( i.e. , a continuous object ) .",
