    "the higgs mechanism  @xcite of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is a necessary ingredient of the standard model  ( sm ) , which is crucial for its internal consistency .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is , thus , one of the major tasks for the experiments at the upcoming large hadron collider  ( lhc ) . in order to confirm the higgs mechanism as the origin of spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 gauge symmetry in the sm , not only",
    "must the higgs boson be discovered , but also its trilinear  ( @xmath1 ) and quartic  ( @xmath2 ) self couplings must be measured in order to completely reconstruct the higgs potential .",
    "furthermore , one must also be able to measure the couplings of the higgs boson to gauge bosons and fermions .    here",
    "we shall be concerned mainly with the trilinear self couplings of the higgs boson . in the standard model ,",
    "there is only one trilinear self coupling of the higgs boson which can be written simply in terms of the higgs boson mass @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5  gev is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the higgs doublet , @xmath6 is the mass of the @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the @xmath9 gauge coupling , respectively .",
    "several extensions of the sm , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm )  @xcite , and the general two higgs doublet model  ( 2hdm )  @xcite , have a more complicated higgs structure . in these models",
    "there are several trilinear higgs couplings , having more complicated dependence on the underlying masses .",
    "it is a challenging task to measure  @xcite these trilinear couplings at the lhc . on the other hand a linear collider could possibly offer much better prospects of measuring these trilinear higgs couplings  @xcite .    at the proposed international linear collider  ( ilc ) , if the higgs boson is not too heavy , the trilinear higgs coupling can be measured via the higgs boson pair production @xmath10 .",
    "a precise measurement of the trilinear higgs self coupling will also make it possible to test extended higgs models , which have a different structure of the higgs potential , and hence different trilinear higgs couplings , as compared to the sm .",
    "the 2hdm is the simplest , yet a very general , model with an extended higgs structure , which leads to various distinct physical effects . in particular",
    ", the model can easily accommodate additional cp violation  @xcite , beyond what is generated by the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa  ( km ) mechanism  @xcite . furthermore , since there is a distinct possibility of measuring precisely the higgs boson self couplings at the ilc , there is a motivation to study the radiative corrections to the trilinear self couplings of the higgs boson .    on the other hand",
    ", there are a number of parameters in the potential of the two higgs doublet model , including those associated with cp violation , which determine the masses and cp properties of the model . in spite of the complicated nature of the higgs potential",
    ", it has been shown in the 2hdm with cp conservation that one - loop corrections to the lightest cp - even higgs boson self coupling are in general of a non decoupling nature , and can give rise to @xmath11 deviations from the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "this happens even when all other couplings of the lightest higgs boson to gauge bosons and fermions are in good agreement with the sm prediction .    in this paper",
    "we shall study in detail the trilinear higgs couplings in the two higgs doublet model  ( 2hdm ) with cp violation .",
    "we shall assume that the underlying gauge group is the sm gauge group .",
    "after spontaneous breaking of the sm gauge symmetry , the higgs spectrum of the model consists of three neutral higgs bosons and two charged higgs bosons . in the cp - conserving version of the model , two neutral higgs bosons  ( @xmath12 ) are cp even , whereas one neutral higgs boson  ( @xmath13 ) is cp odd . in the cp - conserving case , there are , thus , six allowed trilinear higgs couplings which can be labelled as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 involving the cp - even higgs bosons , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , all even in the number of @xmath13 , involving the cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "when cp is not conserved , the neutral higgs bosons do not have a definite cp , and there is no such constraint on the couplings involving the @xmath13 higgs boson .",
    "there , are , thus , a total of ten trilinear higgs couplings in the case of the 2hdm with cp violation .",
    "since this is one of the simplest models which goes beyond the km mechanism of cp violation , it is important to study the impact of cp violation on the higgs self couplings in this model . we shall , therefore , consider the 2hdm with explicit cp violation in the higgs sector in this paper .",
    "this explicit cp violation is introduced through appropriate complex parameters in the potential of the 2hdm .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that this explicit cp violation can not be transformed away by a redefinition of the higgs fields .",
    "thus , one of the objectives of the present study is to determine the effects of this explicit cp violation in the higgs sector on various higgs self couplings in the two higgs doublet model . in our study of the model",
    ", we shall find it convenient to keep the masses of the two lightest neutral higgs bosons fixed , and then study the dependence on other parameters of the model , which will determine the amount of explicit cp violation in various higgs self couplings , and also determine the mass of the heaviest higgs boson . in this way",
    ", we do not lay emphasis on the heavy higgs sector of the theory , whereas at the same time we can exhibit the wide range of values that the trilinear higgs couplings can assume . in particular , we wish to emphasize that , in contrast to the mssm , the heavy mass effects in a general 2hdm do not decouple . in order to demonstrate this",
    "we shall calculate the one - loop corrected higgs boson self - couplings using the method of effective potential in a general 2hdm with explicit cp violation as described above .",
    "this is in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where all couplings and mass parameters were assumed to be real , thereby precluding the phenomena of explicit cp violation in the higgs sector as considered in this paper .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec:2hdm ]",
    "we describe the most general two higgs doublet model with cp violation .",
    "we then discuss the spectrum of the higgs bosons of the model , and the constraints on the parameters when there is cp violation in the model . here we also discuss how only certain sets of parameters of the higgs potential can lead to physically consistent models , and discuss different ways in which these parameters can be specified .",
    "we delineate the regions of the parameter space where there is no cp violation , corresponding to which one of the neutral higgs bosons is odd under p. in section  [ sect : tree - level - couplings ] we derive the tree level trilinear couplings between the neutral as well as the charged higgs bosons of the model , and discuss the correspondence of these couplings with the trilinear higgs couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . here",
    "we also study numerically the trilinear higgs couplings , and discuss the domain of the parameter space that is compatible with various theoretical and experimental constraints .",
    "in section  [ sect : one - loop - level - masses ] we use the method of one - loop effective potential to calculate , as a first step , one - loop corrections to the higgs boson masses . in section  [",
    "sect : one - loop - level - couplings ] , we then calculate the one - loop corrections to the trilinear self couplings of the higgs bosons .",
    "in section  [ sec : quantitative results ] we carry out a detailed numerical study of the one - loop corrected trilinear higgs couplings , discuss the magnitudes of different contributions , the dependence on the scale , as well as the decoupling limit , and show that these couplings can be several times larger than the corresponding standard model trilinear higgs coupling in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "some of the analytical calculations used in our analysis are described in appendices .",
    "the general 2hdm with the underlying gauge group @xmath0 is obtained by extending the higgs sector of the sm with a second @xmath9 higgs doublet with weak hypercharge @xmath20 thus , the model contains @xmath21 complex scalar fields which are arranged as @xmath9 doublets as follows : @xmath22 using these two higgs doublets , the most general renormalizable potential for the 2hdm which is invariant under the @xmath0 gauge group can be written as @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\left\\{\\left[\\lambda_6(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)+\\lambda_7 ( \\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\right](\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2 ) + { \\rm h.c.}\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}\\bigl\\{m_{11}^2(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) + \\left[m_{12}^2 ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)+{\\rm h.c.}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + m_{22}^2(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\bigr\\ } , \\label{hpotential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are dimensionless parameters and the subscript `` tree '' denotes that ( [ hpotential ] ) is a tree - level potential .",
    "we note that @xmath25 are real , whereas @xmath26 are in general complex parameters . similarly , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real , whereas @xmath29 is in general complex .",
    "we note that the terms proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 have to be constrained , since this potential does not satisfy natural flavor conservation  @xcite , even when each doublet is coupled only to up - type or only to down - type quarks .",
    "when the neutral components of the two higgs doublets @xmath32 acquire vacuum expectation values  ( vevs ) , @xmath33 , the gauge group @xmath0 breaks down to @xmath34 whereby three of the eight real fields in ( [ hdoublets ] ) are absorbed by three of the four gauge bosons of @xmath35 which become massive in the process , leaving behind a massless photon .",
    "we can then parametrize the two higgs doublet fields in ( [ hdoublets ] ) as @xmath36 where we have chosen the vevs of the neutral higgs fields to be real , and absorbed the relative phase between the two vevs in the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath31 of @xmath38 .",
    "when we substitute the parametrisation ( [ parhiggs ] ) of the higgs fields in the potential ( [ hpotential ] ) , there will be cubic terms in the higgs fields arising from the quartic couplings @xmath39 , which will give rise to trilinear couplings among the higgs fields .",
    "it is these trilinear couplings that we shall study in detail in this paper .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , in the case of 2hdm with cp conservation , after spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry , we are left with two cp - even higgs bosons @xmath40 a cp - odd higgs boson @xmath41 and a pair of charged higgs bosons @xmath42 . however , with cp violation the neutral higgs bosons @xmath43 mix , and it is then more appropriate to define the weak states @xmath44 to describe the neutral higgs sector of the cp violating two higgs doublet model . in ( [ eq : etas ] )",
    "we have defined @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the would - be neutral goldstone boson , and @xmath47 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields .",
    "we shall take @xmath48 as an independent parameter .",
    "the charged higgs fields and the corresponding charged goldstone boson are likewise defined as @xmath49 respectively .      the tree - level mass squared matrix of the neutral higgs bosons can now be defined as @xmath50 where , after differentiation , all fields are set equal to zero : @xmath51 .",
    "the physical neutral higgs states @xmath52 , which are the eigenstates of the mass squared matrix ( [ eq : m_sq - def ] ) , are then obtained by a rotation @xmath53 @xmath54 or , more explicitly @xmath55 the rotation matrix @xmath53 which diagonalizes  ( [ eq : m_sq - def ] ) , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , can be parametrized as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cal - m ] ) can be inverted as @xmath61 by symmetry , @xmath62 , and , in the general case , this matrix is seen to contain 6 independent parameters .",
    "these may be taken as the three masses , and the angles of the rotation matrix .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are three limits in which there is no cp violation in the 2hdm , corresponding to which one of the neutral higgs bosons is odd under p. these limits can be characterised in terms of the angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the rotation matrix ( [ eq : r - angles ] ) as follows : @xmath65 we note that in the latter limit , we have @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the conventional mixing angle in the cp - even sector of the mssm @xcite . any cp violation in the 2hdm will also depend on the yukawa couplings . in the 2hdm  ii ( model ii ) , where the down - type quarks couple to @xmath68 and the up - type quarks couple to @xmath69 , various measures of `` maximal '' cp violation both in the higgs - vector boson and higgs - quark sectors are discussed in @xcite . these maxima occur in the `` bulk '' of the @xmath63@xmath64 space , typically for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .      minimizing the tree - level potential according to @xmath72 and using the resulting minimization conditions to eliminate @xmath73 and @xmath74 one obtains the elements ( [ eq : m_sq - def ] ) of the tree - level mass squared matrix @xmath75 , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal m}^2_{12}&=v_1 v_2[{{\\rm re\\thinspace}}(\\lambda_3+\\lambda_4+\\lambda_5)-\\nu ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + { { \\textstyle\\frac{3}{2}}}{{\\rm re\\thinspace}}(v_1 ^ 2\\,\\lambda_6+v_2 ^ 2\\,\\lambda_7 ) , \\nonumber \\\\",
