    "the centrality of spectral analysis in a wide range of scientific disciplines , there has been a variety of viewpoints regarding how to quantify distances between spectral density functions . besides the obvious ones which are based on norms , inherited by ambient function - spaces @xmath0 , etc . , there has been a plethora of alternatives which attempt to acknowledge the structure of power spectral density functions as a positive cone .",
    "the most most well known are the kullback - leibler divergence which originates in hypothesis testing and in bayes estimation , the itakura - saito distance which originates in speech analysis both belonging to bregman class ( @xcite ) , the bhattacharyya distance @xcite , and the ali - silvey class of divergences @xcite .",
    "their origin can be traced either to a probabilistic rationale ( as in the case of the kullback - leibler divergence ) or , to some ad - hoc mathematical construct designed to seek distance measures with certain properties ( as in the case of bregman and ali - silvey classes ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to introduce certain new notions of distance which are rooted in filtering theory and provide intrinsic distance measures between any two _ power spectral density _ functions .",
    "our starting point is a prediction problem .",
    "we select an optimal predictive filter for an underlying random process based on the assumption that the process has a given power spectral density @xmath1 .",
    "we then evaluate the performance of such a filter against a second power spectral density @xmath2 which may be thought of as the spectral density function of the `` actual '' random process .",
    "the relative degradation of performance ( i.e. , variance of the prediction error ) quantifies a mismatch between the two functions .",
    "interestingly , it turns out to be equal to the ratio of the arithmetic over the geometric mean of the fraction of the two power spectra .",
    "the logarithm of the relative degradation serves a distance measure .    infinitesimal analysis suggests a pseudo - riemannian metric on the manifold of power spectral density functions .",
    "the presence of such a metric suggests that geodesic distances may be used to quantify divergence between power spectra .",
    "indeed , a characterization of geodesics is provided , and certain logarithmic intervals are shown to satisfy the condition .",
    "the length of such intervals connecting two power spectral densities provides yet another notion of distance between the two .",
    "an identical approach based on the degradation of performance of smoothing filters leads to other expressions which , equally well , quantify divergence between power spectral densities .",
    "two observations appear to be universal .",
    "first that the mismatch between the `` shapes '' of spectral density functions is what turns out to be important .",
    "this is quantified by how far the ratio @xmath3 of the two spectral densities is from being constant across frequencies .",
    "the ratio of spectral density functions is reminiscent of the likelihood ratio in probability theory .",
    "the second observation is that all of the distance measures that we encountered , in essence , they compare different means ( i.e. , arithmetic , geometric , and harmonic , possibly , weighted ) of the ratio of the two spectral density functions or of their logarithms .",
    "it is quite standard , that e.g. , the argithmetic and the geometric means coincide only when the ratio is constant and have a gap otherwise .",
    "the same applies to a wider family of generalized means .",
    "thus , this observation suggests a much larger class of possible alternatives : quantify the divergence between ( the `` shape '' of ) two density functions using the gap between two generalized means of their ratio , or by the slackness of jensen - type of inequalities involving this ratio .",
    "the underlying mathematical construct appears quite distinct from those utilized in defining the bregman and the ali - silvey classes of distance measures .",
    "furthermore , the mathematical construct is deeply rooted in prediction theory and , at least in certain cases , can be motivated as quantifying degradation of performance as we explained earlier .",
    "consider a scalar zero - mean stationary random process @xmath4 and denote by @xmath5 its sequence of autocorrelation samples and by @xmath6 its power spectrum .",
    "thus , @xmath7 and @xmath8 while @xmath9 denotes expectation and `` @xmath10 '' denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we are interested in quadratic optimization problems with respect to the usual inner product @xmath11    the closure of @xmath12 , which we denote by @xmath13 , can be identified with the space @xmath14 of functions which are square integrable with respect to @xmath6 with inner product @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "further , the correspondence @xmath18 is a hilbert space isomorphism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , least - variance approximation problems can be equivalently expressed in @xmath19 . in particular , the variance of the _ one - step - ahead prediction _",
    "error @xmath20 for the _ predictor _",
    "@xmath21 is @xmath22 similarly , the variance of the error of the _ smoothing _",
    "filter @xmath23 is simply @xmath24    in general , the power spectrum @xmath25 is a bounded nonnegative measure on @xmath26 and admits a decomposition @xmath27 with @xmath28 a singular measure and @xmath29 the absolutely continuous part of @xmath25 ( with respect to the lebesgue measure ) . in general the singular part",
    "has no effect on the minimal variance of the error , and the corresponding component of @xmath30 can be estimated with arbitrary accuracy using any `` one - sided '' infinite past .",
    "the variance of the optimal one - step - ahead prediction error depends only on the absolutely continuous part of the power spectrum and is given in terms by the celebrated szeg - kolmogorov formula stated below ( see @xcite and also , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "+    with @xmath27 as above @xmath31 when @xmath32 , and zero otherwise .    in case",
    "@xmath32 the prediction - error variance is nonzero and the random process is non - deterministic in the sense of kolmogorov . in this case , it can be shown that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an outer function in the hardy space @xmath35 with @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 is analytic in the unit disc @xmath38 and its radial limits are square integrable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , the linear combination @xmath39 serves as the optimal predictor of @xmath40 based on past observations and the least variance of the optimal prediction error becomes @xmath41    analogous expressions exist for the optimal smoothing error and the corresponding smoothing filter which uses both past and future values of @xmath42 .",
    "it is quite interesting , and rather straightforward , that while the variance of the optimal one - step - ahead prediction error is the _ geometric mean _ of the spectral density function , the variance of the error , when a smoothing filter utilizes both past and future , turns out to be the _ harmonic mean _ of the spectral density function .",
    "+    ( see @xcite ) [ prop : minvalue]with @xmath27 as above @xmath43 when @xmath44 , and zero otherwise .    in case",
    "@xmath44 the variance of the optimal smoothing error is nonzero and the random process is nondeterministic in the sense that past and future specify the present which can be estimated with zero variance . in this case",
    "( see @xcite ) @xmath45 is the image of the optimal smoothing error @xmath46 under the kolmogorov map , and that @xmath47",
    "we now consider two distinct spectral density functions @xmath48 and postulate a situation where filtering of an underlying random process is attempted based on the incorrect choice between these two alternatives .",
    "the variance is then compared with the least possible variance which is achieved when the correct choice is made ( i.e. , when the predictor is optimal for the spectral density against which it is being evaluated ) .",
    "the degradation of performance is quantified by how much the ratio of the two prediction - error variances exceeds the identity .",
    "this ratio serves as a measure of mismatch between the two spectral densities ( the one which was used to design the predictor and the one against which it is being evaluated ) .",
    "the resulting mismatch turns out to be _ scale - invariant _ i.e .",
    ", the expression is homogeneous .",
    "hence , as a measure of distance it actually quantifies distance between the positive rays that the two spectral density functions define , and thus , it quantifies distance between the respective `` shapes . ''",
    "it turns out that this distance is convex on logarithmic intervals and has a number of distance - like properties , short of being a metric .",
    "let us assume that both @xmath49 and hence , that @xmath50 for corresponding outer @xmath51-functions @xmath52 normalized as before so that @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , @xmath55 denotes the geometric mean of @xmath56 as before , for @xmath54 .",
    "these expressions represent the least variances when the predictor is chosen on the basis of the correct spectral density function . if however , the predictor is based on @xmath57 whereas the underlying process has @xmath58 as its spectral density , then the variance of the prediction error turns out to be @xmath59 if we divide this variance by the optimal value @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 this is the ratio of the _ arithmetic mean _ over the _",
    "geometric mean _ of the fraction @xmath3 of the two spectral density functions .",
    "the expression @xmath62 is not symmetric in the two arguments",
    ". the subscript `` @xmath63 '' signifies ratio of arithmetic over geometric means .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath62 is nonnegative and defines a notion of distance between rays of density functions .",
    "henceforth , we denote this logarithm by @xmath64 alternatively , we can view the above as slackness of a jensen - type inequality .    before we discuss key properties of @xmath65",
    ", we introduce a natural class of paths connecting density functions : for any two density functions @xmath66 , @xmath67,\\ ] ] defines a _ logarithmic interval _ between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the terminology stems from the fact that whenever the needed logarithms exist , @xmath70.\\ ] ] later on we will see that these represent geodesics on the manifold of density functions with respect to an induced pseudo - riemannian metric .",
    "[ prop : prop3 ]    let @xmath56 , @xmath71 represent density functions defined on @xmath72 . the following hold : +    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iv ) are a direct consequence of the corresponding properties given in proposition [ prop : prop3 ] for @xmath73 . property ( iii ) on the other hand follows as before from ( iv ) and",
    "the fact that the derivative of @xmath74 at @xmath75 is zero .",
    "in order to illustrate the quantitative behavior of these measures , we consider three specific power spectra labeled @xmath76 , as before . these are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we then consider the triangle formed with those power spectra as vertices and connected using logarithmic intervals .",
    "the interior of the triangle is similarly sampled at logarithmically placed points .",
    "in essence , we consider the family of power spectral densities @xmath77.\\ ] ] for each value of @xmath78 ( sampled appropriately ) , we evaluate @xmath79 , @xmath80 and compare these to the kullback - leibler divergence between the suitably normalized functions @xmath81 the normalization is necessary if the kullback - leibler divergence is to have properties of a distance measure ( i.e. , nonnegative when its arguments are different , etc . ) .",
    "thus , we denote @xmath82 the set of power spectra in ( [ points ] ) is thought of as a set of points forming an equilateral triangle , conceptually sitting on the @xmath83-plane .",
    "then , the vertical axis represents distance from @xmath58 , measured using these three alternative measures .",
    "the corresponding surfaces are drawn in figures [ fig : surf1]-[fig : surf3 ] .",
    "the three power spectra used are as follows : @xmath84     (  ) , @xmath57 ( - - ) , @xmath85 ( -@xmath86- ) ]    ]    ]    ]    there appears to be little qualitative difference between @xmath87 , @xmath73 , and @xmath88 .",
    "they are also quite similar in that it is easy to calculate functional forms for minimizers of either of these distance measures under moment constraints ( see section [ sec : minimizers ] below ) .",
    "hence , it is important to undercore that @xmath88 lacks an intrinsic interpretation as a distance measure between power spectra , in contrast to @xmath87 which therefore may be preferable for exactly that reason .",
    "a large class of spectral analysis problems is typified by the trigonometric moment problem where a power spectral density is sought to match a partial sequence of autocorrelation samples , i.e. , a positive function @xmath89 is sought such that @xmath90 see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since , in general , the family of consistent @xmath89 s is large , a particular one is chosen `` closest '' to a given `` prior '' .",
    "maximum entropy spectral analysis , for instance , can be interpreted as seeking the spectral density closest in the kullback - leibler sense to one which is flat , i.e. , the prior in this case is the power spectral density of white noise ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the same spirit",
    "we may pose the problem of seeking @xmath89 closest to @xmath91 in the sense of minimizing e.g. , @xmath92 and subject to the moment constraints ( [ momentconstraints ] ) .    to this end , as usual , we introduce lagrange multipliers @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and form the lagrangian @xmath95 setting the variation of @xmath96 identically to zero for all perturbations of @xmath89 gives conditions that help identify the functional form of minimizing @xmath89 s .",
    "briefly , @xmath97 after we eliminate higher order terms .",
    "stationarity conditions require that the above is identically zero for all ( small ) functions @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to @xmath99 from which we deduce that a minimizing @xmath89 must be of the form @xmath100 with @xmath101 then , values for @xmath102 as well as for the lagrange multipliers must be determined so that @xmath89 in ( [ eq : functionalform ] ) satisfies ( [ momentconstraints ] ) and ( [ extra ] ) this can be done for instance using homotopy methods in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that when @xmath103 , the minimizer is the same as in the one obtained by applying the maximum entropy principle ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , i.e. , it turns out to be an all - pole spectral density function which is of course uniquely identified by the moment constraints .",
    "evidently , in general , minimizing @xmath92 gives a different answer than the one obtained by minimizing @xmath104 or , by minimizing other distances .",
    "yet , all such problems are similar and can be dealt with in two steps .",
    "first identify the functional form of a minimizer and then determine values for the coefficients so as to satisfy ( [ momentconstraints ] ) .",
    "the latter step requires solving a nonlinear problem in general , and can be approached in a variety of ways ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) .",
    "infinitesimal perturbations about a given power spectral density function , when measured by any of @xmath73 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 , give rise to nonnegative definite quadratic forms .",
    "these forms are in fact nonsingular on directions other than rays emanating from the origin .",
    "this is due to the fact that the aforementioned distances do not separate points on such rays while they give nonzero distance otherwise .",
    "they thus induce riemannian metrics on suitably defined manifold of spectral rays . in this section ( and the current paper )",
    "we focus on the particular metric induced by @xmath87 , we show how to characterize geodesics , and verify that logarithmic intervals are in fact geodesics .    throughout",
    "we assume that all functions are smooth enough so that the indicated integrals exist .",
    "this , in particular , can be ensured if all spectral density functions are bounded and have bounded inverses as well as bounded derivatives .",
    "weaker conditions are clearly possible . for the purposes of this section we define @xmath105,\\\\ & & \\mbox { with   } f(\\theta )",
    "> 0 , \\mbox { and both } f(\\theta),\\frac{df(\\theta)}{d\\theta } \\mbox { square integrable}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a suitable norm on @xmath89 and its derivative , @xmath106 becomes a ( banach ) manifold .",
    "we also recall the definition @xmath107of the @xmath108-th norm , applicable to any @xmath89 on @xmath109 $ ] provided the integral exist .",
    "whenever , @xmath89 is a density function , the absolute value is obsiously unnecessary .",
    "[ prop : deltas]let @xmath110 where @xmath98 is a perturbation such that @xmath111 .",
    "then @xmath112 here , @xmath113 indicates terms of order @xmath114 or higher .",
    "we prove only the first claim .",
    "the other two can be shown in an identical manner .",
    "we expand @xmath115 using the series @xmath116 , as follows @xmath117 which proves the first claim after canceling and collecting terms .",
    "the other two expressions can be shown similarly .",
    "note that @xmath118 for all @xmath108 , since @xmath111 .",
    "since @xmath73 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 do not separate power spectra which are scalar multiple of one another , we may consider equivalence classes @xmath119 obtained from any spectral density function @xmath89 by a scaling factor , constant across @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "these can be thought of as rays .",
    "they can be identified by pointing to one particular representative .",
    "thus , in particular , the set of rays can be identified with @xmath121 this set can be given the structure of a manifold and thought of as a set of probability density functions on @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "alternatively , we can consider spectral densities as belonging to @xmath106 and accept the fact that we have a pseudo - riemannian metric which vanishes along certain directions .",
    "this follows from proposition [ prop : deltas ] , since @xmath87 ( and similarly , @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) defines a nonnegative definite quadratic form at each `` point '' @xmath124 via @xmath125    a rather standard way to measure distances on manifold is to trace geodesics connecting points , and compute the length of such paths .",
    "thus , it may be of interest to characterize geodesics in our case as well .",
    "we refrain from excessively technical jargon and , following the earlier suggestion , simply assume that all integrals exist .",
    "consider a path @xmath126 , @xmath127 $ ] , of spectral density functions connecting two given ones , namely @xmath128 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath126 is a function of two arguments , the path parameter @xmath129 and the frequency @xmath130 hence , we often write @xmath131 .",
    "the length traversed as @xmath129 varies from @xmath132 to @xmath133 is simply @xmath134 in the last step we eliminated higher order terms in @xmath135 inside the integral , since those integrate to zero .",
    "here and throughout `` @xmath136 '' ( dot ) , as in @xmath137 is used to denote derivative with respect to @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath138 interestingly , the expression in ( [ eq : interesting ] ) only depends on @xmath139 .",
    "thus , if we define @xmath140 then @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 the requirement that the end point of @xmath126 coincide with @xmath128 and @xmath58 , readlily translates into boundary conditions for @xmath144 , namely @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the task of finding extremals of such integrals leads to euler - lagrange equations for the path @xmath144 .",
    "more specifically , the lagrangian corresponding to ( [ eq : length2 ] ) is @xmath147 and only depends on @xmath148 . therefore @xmath149 and the euler - lagrange equations @xmath150 simplify to @xmath151 being independent of @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath148 enters in @xmath152 through an integral over @xmath130 , the partial derivative with respect to @xmath148 is infinitesimal .",
    "thus , we write @xmath153 which is independent of @xmath129 as we just explained . since @xmath154 where the latter term produces again a differential in @xmath130 , it follows that @xmath155 alternatively , @xmath156 which simply says that the variation of @xmath148 about the mean , as a function of @xmath130 , normalized by a `` standard deviation''-like quantity must be independent of @xmath129 .",
    "we summarize our conclusion as follows .",
    "[ prop : geodesics]given two spectral density functions @xmath157 , extremal ( geodesic ) paths @xmath126 ( @xmath127 $ ] ) connecting the two , in the sense of achieving a local extremal of the path integral @xmath158 , must satisfy ( [ eq : must ] ) for @xmath159 , i.e. , the left hand side of ( [ eq : must ] ) must be independent of @xmath129 .    the proof has been established in the arguments leading to the proposition .",
    "we finally verify that logarithmic intervals satisfy ( [ eq : must ] ) .",
    "this is rather straightforward since , for @xmath160 the logarithm @xmath161 is a linear function of @xmath129 and the derivative @xmath162 is already independent of @xmath129 .",
    "the ratio @xmath163 plays a rle analogous to the likelihood ratio of probability theory .",
    "the length of logarithmic intervals can be computed in terms of this ratio by simple inspection since from ( [ eq : interesting ] ) @xmath164 is independent of @xmath129 .",
    "therefore the following statement holds .",
    "the length of the logarithmic path connecting two power spectral densities @xmath128 and @xmath58 ,",
    "is given by @xmath165    the proof follows in the arguments leading to the proposition .",
    "in a way completely analogous to the previous sections we may consider the increase in the variance of the smoothing error when a wrong choice between two alternatives is used to identify a candidate smoothing filter .    thus , we begin with two density functions @xmath48 and assume that @xmath166 .",
    "accordingly we test the optimal smoothing filter based on @xmath57 against @xmath58 . as explained in section [ section : preliminaries ] , the @xmath57-optimal smoothing filter gives rise to an error @xmath167 corresponding , via the kolmogorov mapping , to @xmath168 .",
    "hence , the variance of the smoothing error divided by the @xmath58-optimal variance is @xmath169 interestingly , this can be rewritten as follows @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a normalized measure with variation one .",
    "expression ( [ eq : avsms ] ) shows the degradation as the square of the ratio of the mean - square of the fraction @xmath3 over its arithmetic mean .",
    "these two means , mean - square and arithmetic , are weighted by @xmath172 which is of course dependent on one of the two arguments .",
    "however , the expression is homogeneous and does not depend on scaling of either of the two arguments @xmath58 or @xmath57 .",
    "accordingly , we may define as a distance measure @xmath173 the presence of a data - dependent integration measure may by compared to the ( normalized ) kullback - leibler divergence in ( [ eq : kl ] ) .",
    "the expressions derived in the previous sections suggest that generalized means of the `` likelihood''-like ratio @xmath174 and their logarithms may be used as distance measures between `` shapes '' of density functions @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "more specifically , we know that for any positive function @xmath175 , @xmath176 where @xmath177 denotes the @xmath178-th generalized mean @xmath179 then @xmath180 with a value which depends on how `` far '' @xmath175 is from being constant .",
    "hence , we may use @xmath181 to quantify the distance between the `` shapes '' of @xmath58 and @xmath57 , and since @xmath182 is the geometric mean of @xmath175 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , both @xmath183 that we encountered earlier are special cases of the above .",
    "weighted versions of weighted means may also be used for the same purpose , as suggested in section [ sec : iii ] .",
    "lengths of geodesics as suggested in section [ sec : riemannian ] present another possibility .",
