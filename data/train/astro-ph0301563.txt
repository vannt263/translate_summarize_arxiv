    "the upcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments map ( bennet et al . , 2003 ) and planck ( mandolesi et al . , 2002 ) face the ambitious task of determining several cosmological parameter with a high level of accuracy .",
    "their ambitious goals require the ability in cleaning the maps from the galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds ( refregier and spergel , 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we address the issue of the possible performance the satellite map can have in subtracting a specific extra - galactic foreground , that is the point sources .",
    "point sources can not be avoided by sky cuts , and are the main source of uncertainty at small angular scale where , even when all bright sources are identified and subtracted , their residual contribution may dominate over cosmic variance .",
    "for example , point sources have been the main foreground issue for the cbi experiment ( myers et al.,2002 ) , where they have been the only foreground explicitly modeled and considered in the overall likelihood .",
    "two approaches are commonly adopted for point sources identification : _ ii ) _ the use of exiting point sources catalogs ; _",
    "i ) _ the direct search on the data map or on a filtered version of it . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the latter .",
    "the simplest version of the direct search consists in straight thresholding of the data .",
    "this naive approach only finds very bright sources .",
    "an improved version consists in first filtering the data with an appropriate filter that maximizes the signal of the point source peak with respect to the _ noise _ intended as cmb signal plus instrumental noise ( tegmark and de olivera  costa 1998 )",
    ". here the knowledge of the cmb and the instrumental power spectra are assumed ( see also chiang et al .",
    "2002 for a diferent approach ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to look for point sources in a map obtained by subtraction of two given frequency maps .",
    "the thresholding procedure selects from these maps a subsample of pixels that are more likely to be contaminated by point sources .",
    "this subsample may be used as the point sources catalog ( if the threshold is high enough to avoid fake detections ) or as a useful template for further investigations with alternative techniques .",
    "this subsample is particularly useful for point sources detection in all sky experiments like map and planck , whose maps contain a large number of pixels . in this paper",
    "we discuss the performances of the thresholding technique when applied to an experiment with the characteristics of map .",
    "more specifically , for each method described above we discuss which fraction of the sources are selected after thresholding the frequency maps at different levels and how many pixel in the map are selected by the same procedure .",
    "we suggest a method aimed to maximize the former and minimize the latter .",
    "alternative techniques have been proposed in the literature .",
    "for example , naselsky et al . (",
    "2002 ) proposed a generalization of the filtering method to multi - frequency experiments , claiming an increased signal to noise ratio when filtering an appropriate linear combination of the observed maps .",
    "a possible limitation of this method is the needed assumption on the point source frequency behavior .",
    "maxican  hat wavelets have also been applied in subtracting the point sources ( cayon et al .",
    "2000 , vielva et al .",
    "2001a ) , alone or in conjunction with maximum  entropy ( vielva et al .",
    "this technique applies to single frequency maps , and performs similarly to the filtering method .",
    "in fact , the filters used in the two methods , although derived with different prescriptions , end up to be similar .",
    "we then address the issue of the statistical contamination of the residual sources in the cmb map , estimating the accuracy with which the cmb variance can be recovered if all sources above a certain threshold are removed from the observed map .",
    "we then briefly discuss the impact of residual point sources on the power spectrum .",
    "we show how the moments of the observed map point distribution function can be used to infer characteristics of the point sources population , namely the slope of the point sources flux distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : simu ] we present the characteristics of the simulation ; in section [ sec : resu ] we present the results obtained , that is the efficiency in finding point sources ( [ subse : ptfin ] ) , the impact of the residual signal on the statistics of the cmb map and power spectrum and the performance in the determination of the slope of the point sources distribution ( [ subse : resi ] , [ subse : powsp ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : con ] is dedicated to the conclusions .",
    "we simulate cmb sky maps with the characteristics of the map experiment ( see tab .  [ tab : mapc ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we use a cold dark matter power spectrum , and uniform gaussian noise .",

    "the typical pixel side is 0.2 degrees , which is comparable to the highest resolution of the experiment .    as for the point sources , we consider the following flux dependence : @xmath10 with @xmath2 ( expected values of @xmath11 range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) .",

    "subse : ptfin ]    in this section we compare three techniques for point sources identification .",
    "namely , we perform a thresholding on the following maps : _ i_the raw data ( method i ) ; _ ii _ the maps obtained after applying the filter introduced by tegmark et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( method ii ) ; a map obtained by the subtraction of two maps at different frequencies ( method iii ) .    more specifically , in order to apply method ii we convolve the observed image in each given frequency with a window function whose spherical harmonics coefficients are : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spherical harmonics of the beam and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the power spectra of the cmb and noise respectively .",
    "this filtering has the advantage of subtracting the background and lowering the noise . as a result",
    ", it reduces the bias one may have in thresholding the data directly , where sources of the same intensity are less ( more ) likely to be detected if they sit in a cmb valley ( hill ) .    in order to apply method iii",
    "we deconvolve the @xmath15 ghz map , and then we subtract it from each other frequency map after convolving it with the beam of the experiment at that frequency . this strategy is aimed to subtract the cmb signal .",
    "the potential problem is the increased noise in the output maps .    after filtering the data or combining the observed maps",
    "as explained above , point sources candidates are selected by thresholding the output maps and retaining all pixels above a given threshold .",
    "a candidate pixel can be confirmed as a point source center by looking at the radial profile of the map around it , or at the frequency dependence of that particular pixel in all frequency maps .",
    "this procedure is necessary when dealing with real data , and it allows to produce a catalog of objects with a certain likelihood of being a point source .",
    "the detection probability will ultimately depend upon the likelihood method applied and the modeling of the source considered .",
    "clearly , point sources that did nt make it above the threshold are certainly not going to be detected . while lowering the threshold",
    "allows for more sources to get into the selected set of pixel , it would also allow for a greater number of pixels not associated with point sources to enter the selected sample .",
    "it is therefore important to decide which method retains the greatest number of sources locations among the selected pixels and compare it to the total number of pixels selected at any given threshold . by minimizing the number of pixel selected while maximizing the one containing the point sources centers we have tentative point sources catalog that can be used for efficient point sources confirmation with alternative methods .",
    "we proceed by comparing method i and ii first .",
    "we filtered each frequency map independently with the filter in eq .",
    "[ eq : wl ] , and performed a thresholding the filtered map and of the raw data at different levels ( parametrized by the standard deviation of the map in hand @xmath30 ) .",
    "we then counted the point sources found above a given level , and how many pixels are in the subsample .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : effic ] and  [ fig : wiefrac ] we show the performance of the two methods in finding the point sources .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : effic ] reports the ratio between the fraction of point sources found @xmath31 with respect to the fraction of pixel selected @xmath32 as a function of the threshold @xmath30 .",
    "the frequency where source finding is more efficient is @xmath15 ghz .",
    "we note that in the filtered map there is a big increase in efficiency for @xmath30 between 1 and 3 ( this value is shifted between 2 and 4 for the data map ) .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : wiefrac ] it is clear that the threshold on the @xmath15 ghz map is set at @xmath33 only about @xmath34 of the total sources can be found .",
    "lowering the threshold at 1 @xmath30 allows to detect about @xmath35 of the sources , including all sources above @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ fig : sfrac ] ) and @xmath37 of sources above @xmath38 .",
    "however , one would still be left with about @xmath39 of the total number of pixel to analyze ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wiefrac ] , upper left panel ) .",
    "this problem can be avoided by selecting the pixels according to whether or not they are above a certain threshold at all frequencies . the bottom right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiefrac ] shows that if one considers pixels with signal above @xmath40 at all frequencies , one may still find @xmath41 of all sources with less pixels to analyze .",
    "the ratio between the number of pixels occupied by point sources centers and the number of pixels above the threshold ( @xmath42 ; dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiefrac ] ) ranges between 0.5 and 0.95 , while in order to get a similar amount of sources from the 90 ghz map alone that ratio is 0.05  0.2 .    in the same thresholding range ,",
    "if we considered all the observed maps instead of the filtered ones we would still be able to find 0.2  0.4 of the total number of sources , but with a much noisier signal : the ratio @xmath42 would be 0.15  0.20 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrac ] we report the fraction of sources found above a certain threshold in all filtered maps as a function of source intensity . if @xmath30 is chosen to be one , @xmath43 of sources above @xmath44 and @xmath45 above @xmath36 can be found . due to the steepness of the curves ,",
    "lowering the threshold to @xmath46 would imply the possible detection of @xmath47 of sources above @xmath36 and @xmath48 above @xmath38 .",
    "when dealing with the real map , however , there is the additional complication of confirming the point sources by looking at their profile in the map .",
    "this procedure is likely to be more difficult for weaker sources .",
    "the number estimated here are therefore to be considered optimistic for weak sources .    when analyzing the maps obtained as differences of two frequency maps ( method iii ) , we find different results according to the frequency considered .",
    "the efficiency of point sources finding on the @xmath49 ghz map is very low , the fraction of point sources found being equal to the fraction of pixels analyzed for any threshold .",
    "when maps at lower frequencies are considered , the performance of this method is similar to the filtering one ( method ii ) .",
    "however , the combined information from different frequencies is lower because in practice this procedure gives up two frequency maps .",
    "we conclude that the best strategy consists in using the combined information from the filtering method ( method ii ) , with a threshold 0.5  1 @xmath30 .",
    "note that the procedure proposed does not assume any particular frequency dependence for the point sources .",
    "it just exploits the fact that point sources are expected to be in the same locations in the different frequency maps , while the peaks in the noise distribution are uncorrelated between frequency maps .",
    "the present analysis was based on some assumptions implicit in the simulations , like the pixel size or the frequency dependence of the point sources .",
    "as for the pixel size , we assume the biggest possible considering the highest experiment resolution . if we chose to perform a higher resolution simulation",
    "the noise variance would increase , while the signal from point sources would remain the same .",
    "since method ii performs a convolution of be map with a window function that has a characteristic smoothing scale of the order of the beam size at that frequency , using a finer resolution would nt change the performance . in methods",
    "i and ii there would be an increase of spurious detections at any given threshold due to the higher pixel noise , resulting in a less efficient point sources finding .",
    "given our conclusion on the preferred method , we do nt investigate this issue any further .",
    "as for the frequency dependence of point sources , the approximately flat spectra sources we simulated seem to fit the majority of radio sources ( sokasian et al .",
    "the rayleigh  jeans temperature fluctuation produced by point sources scales as @xmath50 , and since for map we have @xmath51 there is no obvious frequency map where to look for flat spectrum sources . should future observations suggest that a considerable fraction of sources show significant departures from this frequency dependence , a different strategy might be needed .",
    "in particular , if the spectra show a bump in the frequency range of interest , there might be a preferred frequency map , different from the 90 ghz one , for point sources detection .",
    "the method presented here is however not dependent on the point sources spectrum , and can in principle be investigated with different simulations .",
    "[ subse : resi ] after having identified and subtracted the bright sources , the remaining ones still affect the real space statistics of the cmb that we want to measure .",
    "we shall use this dependence in order to infer both properties of the point sources distribution and the expected variance of the cmbn point distribution function .",
    "having assumed gaussian fluctuations , we expect the point distribution function of the cmb signal to be completely described by its variance . for a full sky experiment",
    "we have : @xmath52    while an unbiased estimator for this quantity exists , cosmic variance sets a limit to the precision with which the variance is determined : @xmath53 in the specific cdm case we are adopting here and for the beam of the 90 ghz map , we have : @xmath54 given the additional contribution of the noise ( for our pixellization and 2 years of data ) , the cosmic variance is expected to be @xmath55 of the cmb plus noise signal ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "faint point sources contaminate the map rendering the cmb+noise statistics non  gaussian .",
    "estimators of non  gaussianity may rely on asymmetries of the point distribution function and the study of its moments ( rubin  martin & sunyaev , 2002 ) , or on the study of the bispectrum and trispectrum in fourier space ( komatsu et al 2001 ) .    in this work we concentrate on the first four moments of the point distribution function of the map after sources subtraction . on the @xmath15 ghz map we performed a progressive subtraction of point sources above a certain threshold @xmath57 ( expressed in units of @xmath21 ) .",
    "all pixels in a ring of radius of @xmath14 fwhm from the point source location were removed from the map in order to avoid residual signal from the convolution process .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : mean ] we show , for a particular map , how the various moments are affected by the remaining point sources .",
    "although bright sources are rare , their impact on the statistics of the map is most relevant .",
    "for example , in the realistic case that all sources above @xmath58 are removed , the estimated variance of the cleaned map would be within @xmath59 of @xmath60 .",
    "this means that residual point sources potentially affect the final distribution inducing an error on the variance comparable to the cosmic variance .    the other relevant feature of fig .  [ fig : mean ] is the shape of the curves , which is linked to the characteristics of the point sources distribution . in the following",
    "we will discuss how how well it is possible to determine such distribution and the variance of the cmb by looking at the moments of the maps .",
    "the moments plotted here are non  centered , that is they are calculated as : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the normalized pixel distribution . for a gaussian field with zero mean ,",
    "as the simulated cmbn map is , we would expect @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . in reality , the cmbn map itself deviates from this formulae because of cosmic variance , so that the gaussianity hypothesis can not be fully exploited . in the following we assumed @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but put no constraints on @xmath69 .",
    "the final map is a sum of the cmbn map ( @xmath70 ) and the point sources ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 . given the assumptions above , the moments of the total map can be expressed in terms of moments of @xmath70 and @xmath71 as follows : @xmath73    where @xmath71 is a function of the intensity of the sources removed : @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "any given moment is therefore a function of the slope @xmath11 , the normalization @xmath76 and the minimum flux of the sources @xmath77 , none of which is supposed to be known a priori .",
    "we performed 100 simulations of point sources map and added them to a noisy cmb one . for any given simulated map",
    ", we calculated the first four moments as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "we then fixed @xmath11 and performed a simultaneous fit to all moments using the formulas in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intmom ] ) . as a conservative approach",
    ", we considered to be able to detect only sources above @xmath58 , and therefore considered to know the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] only for @xmath78 .",
    "the parameters of the fit were : @xmath79,@xmath69 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the likelihood was simply the sum over all moments and all points of the percentage difference of the fit to the data .",
    "we then selected the @xmath11 value which minimized the likelihood , and its associated parameters at the best fit .    in figs .",
    "( [ fig : enne ] ) and ( [ fig : histo ] ) and we show the histograms for the @xmath11 values found and for the assessed @xmath21 . as for the @xmath11 value ,",
    "the estimated mean and standard deviation are : @xmath80 .",
    "the significant standard deviation of the distribution is due to the fact that there is degeneracy between the parameters , in particular between @xmath11 and @xmath76 .",
    "the best fit theoretical curves for a fixed @xmath11 are indistinguishable , so that one should resort to other methods to have a more precise @xmath11 estimate .",
    "an alternative method , not investigated here , could consist in fitting the positive tail of the observed distribution , in the region where the cmbn contribution is expected to be negligible .",
    "on the other hand , the shape of the underlying theoretical curves is very well constrained . as a result , the estimated value of the cmbn map variance ( @xmath81)is very close to the true one : @xmath82 . knowing the noise properties of the instrument , we are therefore confident that we can estimate the variance of our underlying cmb map with a precision that is far below cosmic variance . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : histo ] ) we also note that if we actually knew the precise true @xmath11 value , our estimate for the variance would have been @xmath83 .",
    "these results are dependent on the fact that all curves are fitted simultaneously and that the second and fourth moment for the cmb follow the gaussian hypothesis .",
    "fitting the variance curve only does nt allow neither a good determination of the spectral index @xmath11 nor of the cmbn variance .",
    "when imposing that all curves are fitted simultaneously , improved results are obtained only if we impose that the extrapolated values for the second and fourth moments follow what one would expect for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath21 depends on the pixel noise which in turn is a function of the pixel size assumed .",
    "given any initial finer pixellization , it is possible to rebin the map to this resolution without loss of cosmological information .",
    "the present procedure can then be applied .",
    "[ subse : powsp ]    in this section we show the impact of the point sources on the power spectrum , computed as @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the spherical harmonics of the map .",
    "we applied the procedure to the observed map ( cmbn plus point sources ) and then to the observed map where sources above a specific threshold have been subtracted . in fig.([fig : powsp ] ) we show , for a particular 90 ghz map , the difference between the power spectrum of the observed map and the underlying cmbn one .",
    "point sources contaminate the power spectrum at 20% level at @xmath86 . in fig.([fig : powscut ] ) we plot , for some particular l s , the percentage difference between the cmbn power spectrum and the one obtained from the maps where sources above a threshold @xmath57 have been subtracted .",
    "bright sources have the greatest impact on the power spectrum . subtracting sources above 12 @xmath0 , for example",
    ", brings the power spectrum from more than 100% to only 9% away from the cmbn one at l=400 . progressively subtracting fainter sources have a greater impact on the higher l s . at @xmath86 ,",
    "the impact of point sources is about 2% quite independently from @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : powscut ] ) . if all sources above 4 @xmath0 are subtracted from the map , the power spectrum is overestimated by about 2% at @xmath87 and about 15% at l=400 .",
    "we investigated the problem of point sources subtraction from the observed map multi - frequency maps .",
    "first we analyzed possible strategies for point sources finding without the help of external maps .",
    "we found that the best strategy consists in applying the linear filtering in eq .",
    "[ eq : wl ] to each frequency independently , cutting the maps with a relative low threshold ( @xmath88 ) and then considering only the pixels that satisfy this constraint in all maps .",
    "this method outperforms similar strategies applied to observed maps and to maps obtained by subtraction of two frequencies . with this strategy",
    "we may expect to find @xmath43 of sources above @xmath44 and @xmath45 above @xmath36 , as a conservative estimate .",
    "assuming that the brightest sources are going to be found , we addressed the issue of how statistics is affected by the residual sources in the map .",
    "if all sources above @xmath44 are found the variance of the cmb map is recovered within @xmath89 .",
    "we used the information from the first four moments of the map to infer the variance of the cmb plus noise map and the slope of the point sources distribution .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : enne ] and [ fig : histo ] . extrapolating the variance curve to null source contribution ( @xmath90 )",
    "allows to determine the variance of the @xmath91 plus noise map within @xmath92 .",
    "this value should be compared with the ratio of cosmic variance to the cmbn one , which is about @xmath93 for the cdm case treated here .",
    "the same strategy allows for a determination of the spectral index of the point sources distribution . for a fiducial @xmath2 value , we find @xmath80 , where the significant spread is due to a degeneracy with the normalization @xmath76 .",
    "these results are obtained in the approximation of null contribution from other foregrounds . while this is likely to be the case close to the galactic pole , it may not hold near the plane .",
