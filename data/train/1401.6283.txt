    "for millennia , space was considered the fixed background  the arena where physical phenomena took place .",
    "special relativity changed this , by proposing spacetime as the new arena .",
    "then , while trying to extend the success of special relativity to non - inertial frames and gravity , einstein realized that one should let go the idea of an immutable background , and general relativity ( gr ) was born .",
    "there is a very deep interdependence between matter and the geometry of spacetime , encoded in einstein s equation .",
    "its predictions were tested with high accuracy , and confirmed .    however , the task of decoding the way our universe works from something as abstract as einstein s equation is not easy , and we are far from grasping all of its consequences .",
    "for instance , even from the beginning , when schwarzschild proposed his model for the exterior of a spherically symmetric object , einstein s equations led to infinities @xcite .",
    "the schwarzschild metric tensor becomes infinite at @xmath0 and on the event horizon  where @xmath1 .",
    "the big bang also exhibited a singularity @xcite .",
    "the first reaction to the singularities was to somehow minimize their importance , on the grounds that they are exceptions due to the perfect symmetry of the solutions .",
    "this hope was ruined by the theorems of penrose @xcite and hawking @xcite , showing that the singularities are predicted to occur in gr under very general conditions , and are not caused by the perfect symmetry .",
    "singularities , hidden by the event horizon or naked , are very well researched in the literature ( for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "interesting results concerning singularities were obtained in some modified gravity theories , e.g. @xmath2 gravity ( @xcite and references therein ) . another way to avoid singularities",
    "was proposed in non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition to the singularities , infinities occur in gr when we try to quantize gravity , because gravity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable @xcite .",
    "it is expected by many that a solution to the problem of quantization will also remove the singularities .",
    "for example , _ loop quantum cosmology _ obtained significant positive results in showing that quantum effects may prevent the occurrence of singularities @xcite .",
    "there is another possibility : the problem of singularities may be in fact not due to gr , but to our limited understanding of gr .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to better understand singularities , even in the eventuality that a better theory will replace gr . in the following we review some recent results showing that by confronting singularities , we realize that they are not that undesirable @xcite .",
    "moreover , new possibilities open also for the quantum gravity problem .",
    "not all singularities are born equal .",
    "we can roughly classify the singularities in two types :    1 .   _ malign singularities _ : some of the components of the metric are divergent : @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   _ benign singularities _ : @xmath4 are smooth and finite , but @xmath5 .",
    "benign singularities turn out to be , in many cases , manageable @xcite .",
    "the infinities simply disappear , if we use different geometric objects to write the equations and describe the phenomena . at points where the metric is nondegenerate ,",
    "the proposed description is equivalent to the standard one .",
    "but , in addition , it works also at the points where the metric becomes degenerate .",
    "malign singularities appear in the black hole solutions .",
    "they appear to be malign because the coordinates in which are represented are singular . in non - singular coordinates",
    ", they become benign @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the case of the apparent singularity on the event horizon , which turned out to be a coordinate singularity , and not a genuine one @xcite .",
    "the geometry of spacetime is encoded in the metric tensor . to write down field equations",
    ", we have to use partial derivatives . in curved spaces ,",
    "partial derivatives are replaced by _",
    "covariant derivatives_. they are defined with the help of the _ levi - civita connection _ , which takes into account the parallel translations , to compare fields at infinitesimally closed points .",
    "the covariant derivative is written using the christoffel symbol of the second kind , obtained from the metric tensor by @xmath6 it can be used to define the riemann curvature tensor @xmath7 it plays a major part in the einstein equation @xmath8 since @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ricci tensor , and @xmath11 is the scalar curvature .    in the case of malign singularities , since some of metric s components are singular , the geometric objects like the levi - civita connection and the riemann curvature tensor are singular too .",
    "therefore , it seems that the situation of malign singularities is hopeless .    even in the case of benign singularities , when the metric is smooth , but its determinant @xmath5 , the usual riemannian objects are singular . for example , the covariant derivative ca nt be defined , because the inverse of the metric , @xmath12 , becomes singular ( @xmath13 when @xmath5 ) .",
    "this makes the christoffel s symbols of the second kind , and the riemann curvature singular .",
    "it is therefore understandable why singularities were considered unsolvable problems for so many years .      the main variables which appear in the equations are indeed singular .",
    "but we can replace them with new variables , which are equivalent to the original ones on the domain where both are defined .",
    "sometimes , we can choose the new variables so that the equations remain valid at points where the original ones were singular .",
    "the geometric objects of interest that become singular when the metric is degenerate are the levi - civita connection , the riemann curvature , the ricci and the scalar curvatures . if the metric is nondegenerate , the christoffel symbols of the first kind are equivalent to those of the second kind , in the sense that by knowing one of them , we can obtain the other one .",
    "similarly , the riemann curvature @xmath14 is equivalent to @xmath15 , the ricci and scalar curvatures are equivalent to their densitized versions and to their kulkarni - nomizu products ( see equation [ eq_kulkarni_nomizu ] ) with the metric . in some important cases ,",
