    "the absorption systems with @xmath14 show the damping wing in the absorption profile , and are called damped ly@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently the dlas has been studied even by grb aftergrow ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "thanks to these works , our understanding on the relationship between dlas and host galaxies have improved .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that a significant fraction of dlas are distributed in the same dark matter halos as the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretically , @xcite examined the number fraction of dlas related to lbgs using cosmological amr simulations . @xcite",
    "estimated the dla ",
    "lbg cross - correlation function using cosmological sph simulations , and showed that their result agrees well with the observational estimate of @xcite .    a connection between dlas and ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) has also been suggested .",
    "@xcite investigated ly@xmath0 emission from 341 dlas at @xmath16 , and concluded that the overall dla population seems to originate from the low luminosity end of laes at high redshift .",
    "@xcite simulated three dimensional ly@xmath0 radiative transfer ( rt ) for high - redshift galaxies in cosmological sph simulations .",
    "they showed that dla host galaxies show extended ly@xmath0 emission around high - column density region .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission is extended over several arc seconds , and has the spectral width of several hundred km s@xmath17 .",
    "a combination of these observational and theoretical works seem to suggest that dlas are associated with a wide variety of sources , such as lbgs and laes .    for a better understanding of dlas",
    ", it is quite important to investigate various feedback effects in galaxies which can drastically change the state of gas .",
    "multiple supernovae can cause galactic wind , and hence change gas distribution largely in galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of galactic wind on the hi  column density distribution function @xmath18 , and found that strong galactic winds with a speed of @xmath19500kms@xmath17 is needed to reproduce the observed @xmath18 at high @xmath20 values .",
    "@xcite also found that strong galactic winds with speed of @xmath19600kms@xmath17 are needed in order to reproduce the observed @xmath18 and the evolution of hi  mass density with redshift .",
    "several authors have suggested that galactic outflows can produce the large velocity dispersion as observed in dlas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gas inflows from surrounding igm can also have strong impact on the absorption systems in high-@xmath21 galaxies .",
    "recent simulations have revealed a new theoretical paradigm for galaxy evolution that a large amount of gas penetrate deep inside dark matter haloes as cold , filamentary streams @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the neutral hydrogen content in the cold accretion to lbgs using sph simulations with uvb rt .",
    "they showed that a part of gas could be dlas , however the covering fraction was quite small .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed the neutral hydrogen gas content in cold stream by cosmological amr simulations and rt calculation of local stellar source and uvb .",
    "they find that most of the gas in cold streams is ionized , however it can survive as lyman - limit systems ( llss ) , which is defined by column densities of @xmath22 atoms @xmath23",
    ".    the observations of dla metallicity can also give important constraints on feedback processes , as the interstellar gas can be enriched by supernovae in the early universe .",
    "@xcite presented the metallicity distribution of dlas and suggested that the dlas with ly@xmath0 emission tend to have higher metallicities of @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite presented the velocity width @xmath25metallicity relation of dlas from the line width of low- ionization metals , and showed that the metallicity is linearly proportional to @xmath25 with a large dispersion .",
    "they also suggested that the slope of fitting function for @xmath25metallicity relation is the same for the sample at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but the median metallicity decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "moreover , @xcite presented the metallicities of a larger dla sample with a large dispersion similar to that of @xcite .",
    "theoretically , recent numerical simulations which include metal enrichment by supernovae have successfully produced the observed metal distribution of dlas @xcite .",
    "another important feedback on dlas is radiation from uvb and local stellar sources .",
    "the uv radiation can ionize hydrogen gas , and largely reduce the neutral fraction of ism .",
    "earlier @xcite and @xcite included the self - shielding correction for uvb radiation to reproduce dla statistics in there numerical simulations .",
    "thereafter , recent simulations have reproduced various observation data of dlas reasonably well by considering the effect of uv rt @xcite .",
    "most of them have focused on the rt of uvb , and found that the self - shielding effect is crucial for matching the observed @xmath18 of dlas .",
    "@xcite showed that the simple self - shielding model without rt calculations could reproduce the observed @xmath18 very well except for the very high @xmath20 values .",
    "@xcite also reproduced the observed @xmath18 in the range of @xmath28atoms@xmath23 by post - processing cosmological sph simulations for the uvb rt .    on the other hand",
    ", the flux of stellar radiation near the star cluster can be much higher than the local uvb , hence stellar rt can be important for dlas and llss .",
    "however , it has been ignored in many simulations .",
    "some authors have suggested that the uv radiation from local stellar sources can be important for absorption systems @xcite , however , there have not been extensive studies of direct rt calculations that examined the effect of local stellar sources .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath18 at @xmath1 does not change very much , based on a direct rt calculation from young stellar sources .",
    "@xcite carried out the rt calculations of local stellar sources and uvb for seven high - resolution simulated galaxies , and found that the local stellar radiation changed @xmath18 at @xmath29@xmath23 by @xmath190.5 dex to the other model without local stellar radiation .",
    "their simulation result is in good agreement with observation at @xmath30 , however it underestimates @xmath18 at lower @xmath20 range of lls .",
    "the stellar radiation flux onto a gas cloud varies depending on the distance between gas and stars and the type of sed .",
    "therefore in a more realistic inhomogeneous medium , precise rt calculations are needed to study the effects of stellar radiation on absorption systems .",
    "furthermore , since the distribution of stars and gas varies among different galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we need to carry out the rt calculation for many galaxies to discuss the statistical data such as @xmath18 . in the present work ,",
    "we perform precise rt calculations with @xmath31 angular bins for each star particle in cosmological sph simulations , and examine the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas for a few hundred galaxies .",
    "our rt code is based on the ray - tracing method , which can estimate the ionization structure more accurately than the monte carlo method that @xcite used ( see * ? ? ? * for a comparison of rt methods ) .",
    "in addition , the number of galaxy sample processed with rt in our work is much larger ( @xmath32 ) than that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , our calculation allows us to investigate the effect of rt more reliably on the statistical quantities of dlas and llss , such as @xmath18 and the mass dependence of cross sections .",
    "moreover , by direct rt calculations of uvb , we verify the self - shielding model of uvb derived by @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the physical quantities of host galaxies of dlas and llss , such as the halo mass , star formation rate , stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our simulations and our approach for rt calculations in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : result ] , we present our results , and show the effect of stellar and uvb radiation on cross sections of dlas and llss , and on @xmath18 . in section  [",

    "we use an updated and modified version of the tree - particle - mesh ( treepm ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 ( originally described in * ? ? ?",
    "the sph calculation is performed based on the entropy conservative formulation @xcite .",
    "our fiducial code includes radiative cooling by h , he , and metals @xcite , star formation , supernova feedback , a phenomenological model for galactic winds and a sub - resolution model of multiphase ism @xcite .",
    "we also include the heating by a uniform uvb , which we will discuss more in section  [ sec : uvb ] .    in this multiphase ism model ,",
    "high - density ism is pictured to be a two - phase fluid consisting of cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hot ambient phase .",
    "cold clouds grow by radiative cooling out of the hot medium , and this material forms the reservoir of baryons available for star formation .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is estimated for each gas particle that have densities above the threshold density , and the star particles are spawned statistically based on the sfr . for the star formation model , the `` pressure sf model ''",
    "is being used @xcite .",
    "this model estimates the sfr based on the local gas pressure rather than the gas density , and prevents artificial fragmentation of the gas .",
    "the simulations used in this paper also uses the  multicomponent variable wind \" model developed by @xcite .",
    "this wind model is based on both the energy - driven wind and the momentum - driven wind @xcite , and the wind speed depends on the galaxy stellar mass and sfr .",
    "it gives more favorable results when compared to the observations of cosmic civ mass density and igm temperature than the previous model with a constant wind speed . to enable this new wind model",
    ", @xcite implemented an on - the - fly group - finder into gadget-3 to compute galaxy masses and sfrs while the simulation is running .",
    "the group - finder , which is a simplified variant of the algorithm developed by @xcite , identifies the isolated groups of star and gas particles ( i.e. , galaxies ) based on the baryonic density field .",
    "the detailed procedure of this galaxy grouping is described in @xcite .",
    "the simulations used in this paper are performed with @xmath34 particles .",

    "to study the effect of stellar radiation on dlas and llss , we compute the stellar radiation transfer and the ionization structure of gas in each dark matter halo by post - processing the simulation output . the rt scheme used in this paper is the authentic radiation transfer ( art ) method , and the treatment is basically the same as in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the procedure of rt calculation .",
    "first we set up a uniform grid around each dark matter halo with a grid cell size equal to the gravitational softening length of the simulation , and translate the sph gas information into a gridded data .",
    "as for the scattering of photons , we employ the on - the - spot approximation @xcite , in which the scattered photons are assumed to be absorbed immediately on the spot . in this work , the rt equation is solved along @xmath46 rays ( @xmath1910@xmath47 ) with a uniform angular resolution from each source , where @xmath48 is the grid number on a side of the calculation box of each galaxy .",
    "we shoot the radiation rays in a radial fashion from each star particles .",
    "the number of ionizing photons emitted from the source stars is computed based on the theoretical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) given by the population synthesis code pgase v2.0 @xcite .",
    "we consider the effect of age and metallicity of the stellar population by interpolating the table generated from the result of pgase .",
    "we assume the @xcite initial mass function with the mass range of @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , we consider the dust extinction .",
    "the dust model is similar to @xcite , e.g. , @xmath50 with a silicate - like mass density of 3g@xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are dust mass , gas mass and metallicity .",
    "the size distribution is @xmath55 @xcite with the dust radius of @xmath56 .",
    "since the assumed range of dust size is larger than the wavelength of lyman limit , we assume the absorption efficiency @xmath57 for the ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "the uvb can ionize the baryonic gas in galaxies , and then gas can be heated up to @xmath58k .",
    "it would be ideal to compute the rt of both uvb and stellar radiation as the simulation runs , however in practice it is a very expensive calculation .",
    "in general , the calculation amount of uvb transfer is larger than that of stellar radiation by @xmath59 orders of magnitude @xcite",
    ". therefore we first use the simple , four different models of uvb , similarly to @xcite .",
    "we then compute the actual uvb transfer for some galaxies to check the validity of the uvb models .",
    "our fiducial simulations include a uniform uvb with a modified @xcite ( hereafter hm96 ) spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the reionization takes place at @xmath60 as suggested by the quasar observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stellar radiative transfer calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the following four simulations with different treatment of uvb ( but with the same initial condition ) to examine the effects of uvb :    1 .   *",
    "optically - thin model * : a uniform uvb radiation field with an optically thin approximation .",

    "* otuv model * ( optically thick uv ) : the ism is optically thin to the uvb in the lower density regions with @xmath62@xmath51 , but completely optically thick in higher density regions of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the threshold density , above which star formation is allowed .",
    "the value of @xmath65 was determined by @xcite based on the observed sf cut - off column density of the kennicutt law .",
    "the otuv model implicitly assumes that the uvb can not penetrate into the high density regions by self - shielding .",
    "this type of self - shielding model was first proposed by @xcite and @xcite to examine @xmath18 and dla kinematics .",
    "later @xcite successfully reproduced the observed @xmath18 by incorporating the otuv model into cosmological simulations .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "no - uvb model * : uvb does not exist at all .",
    "since we use the same initial condition for these runs , we can compare the effect of radiation halo by halo basis .",
    "after discussing the above four models in the beginning of section  [ sec : fn ] , we then move on to discuss the effects of radiative transfer in sections   [ sec : uvbtransfer ] and [ sec : stellarrt ] .",
    "we compute the transfer of local stellar radiation in each halo as post - processing , and estimate the ionization structure in the equilibrium state by evaluating @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the photoionization rate by uvb and stellar radiation respectively ; @xmath69 is the collisional ionization rate ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the number density of free - electron , neutral and ionized hydrogen , respectively ; @xmath72 is the total recombination coefficient to all bound excitation levels .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is estimated by the full rt calculation , but @xmath67 is computed with the above uvb model .",
    "we first compare our simulation results to the recent observations of hi  column density function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and examine the effect of uvb and stellar radiation on @xmath18 .",
    "we then examine the hi  cross section of dlas and llss , and study how they change with the uvb models and the rt calculation .",
    "finally , we study the typical physical properties of dla and lls gas , such as sfr and metallicity .",
    "the column density distribution function @xmath73 is defined such that @xmath74 is the number of absorbers per sight line with hi  column density in the interval @xmath75 $ ] , and absorption distance in the interval @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the absorption distance @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 in practice , if the comoving box - size of the simulation is @xmath79 , then the corresponding absorption distance per sight - line is @xmath80 for example , for @xmath81 and @xmath1 , we have @xmath82 .",
    "since the simulation box size is very small , we can safely assume that the dla clouds do not overlap along a sight- line , and we can compute the @xmath20 distribution function by counting the number of projected grid - cells with column densities in the range @xmath75 $ ] for all halos in the simulation .",
    "we use the same grid that we set around each dark matter halo for the rt calculation , with the grid cell size equal to the comoving gravitational softening length .    .",

    "the resulting @xmath18 is insensitive to the direction of projection . by this method",
    ", we are treating each projected grid - cell element as one line - of - sight .",
    "we have also checked that we are not missing any lls columns in the outskirts of the halo by doubling the size of the grid for some of the halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdfall ] shows @xmath18 in the range of @xmath90 at @xmath1 together with some observational data .",
    "the no - uvb run overpredicts the observed data points at all @xmath20 range . in particular",
    ", the difference becomes as large as an order of magnitude at @xmath91@xmath23 .",
    "this shows that the ionization effect by the uvb is crucial in reproducing the observed lls and dla column density distribution functions . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath18 of the optically - thin and the hm0.5 runs are close to the observed data at @xmath92 , however , falls below the observation data at @xmath93 by a significant amount .",
    "the otuv run agrees with the observed @xmath18 much better than the other models in a wide range of @xmath94 . at lower column densities of @xmath95@xmath23 ,",
    "the otuv run is lower than the opticall - thin run , but it still fits with the observed range indicated by the yellow box .",
    "thus , as far as the column density range of lls and dla is concerned , we conclude that the uvb treatment of the otuv run successfully reproduces the observational data in a wide range of @xmath94 .",
    "we note that the result of the otuv run in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] is slightly different from that in @xcite , but this is because the galactic wind model was slightly different between the two works .",
    "we have also checked the results with the updated uvb model of @xcite , and found that the results are not very different .",
    "one notable feature in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] is that the otuv run is higher than the observed @xmath18 at @xmath96 .",
    "these high column density sight - lines mainly come from haloes of higher dust - to - gas ratio . in such halos ,",
    "the molecular hydrogen h@xmath97 is created efficiently , and the h@xmath98 mass fraction can be @xmath99 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because our current simulations do not include h@xmath97 formation , we may overpredict @xmath18 at high column densities of @xmath96@xmath23 .    ) as a function of hydrogen number density for four different halos in the otuv run ( halo a : @xmath100 , b : @xmath101 , c : @xmath102 , and d : @xmath103 ) .",
    "the halos are taken from the otuv run , but we are solving the transfer of uvb radiation directly in each cell as shown by the red points . the black dashed lines and",
    "the blue solid lines indicate the ionization rate in the optically - thin model and the otuv model , respectively . ]",
    "we find that the stellar radiation transfer does not affect the shape of @xmath18 ( overlapping blue dashed line and red solid line in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] ) , whereas the uvb model changes the @xmath18 significantly .",
    "we will discuss the effect of stellar radiation on dlas and llss in more detail later in the paper .",
    "the change of column density by uvb in the otuv run is similar to those found by previous works ( e.g. , fig .",
    "a1 in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the effect by stellar radiation in our simulation is much smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "there could be several possible reasons for this difference as follows . in our simulations ,",
    "the high - density gas clumps near young stars can effectively absorb stellar radiation , and block the propagation of stellar radiation over extended regions in a galaxy @xcite .",
    "another possible reason could be different numerical methods : our rt method is based on a ray - tracing method , whereas fumagalli s method is monte carlo .",
    "the ray - tracing method can estimate the ionisation structure by point sources more accurately , while the monte carlo method can cause some artificial inhomogeneity ( see the comparison work by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , the spatial resolution is always a concern , and we note that the resolution of fumagalli s amr simulation in high - density regions is better than ours .",
    "unfortunately it is very difficult to tell the exact resolution effects unless we compare the two codes closely side by side .",
    "another major source of different results might be the different mass range of simulated galaxies in each simulation .",
    "@xcite focused on only seven star - forming galaxies with @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations cover a wider range of galaxy masses , and there are numerous low - mass , faint galaxies without young star clusters that contribute to the dla cross section . in those low - mass haloes ,",
    "the local stellar radiation does not impact the ionization of gas , and fumagalli et al.s simulation did not include these low - mass halos . in our simulations ,",
    "about half of the total dla cross section is contributed by faint low - mass haloes where there is no young stars in our simulations .",
    "the dlas in these faint haloes are unaffected by the stellar radiation .",
    "this could explain the little effect of local stellar radiation on @xmath18 in our simulations , and more effect in fumagalli s .",
    "in addition , fumagalli et al.s @xmath18 showed good agreement with observations at @xmath105@xmath23 , but underpredicted at @xmath106 @xmath23 .",
    "they suggested that the reason for the underestimate might be their limited galaxy sample with @xmath107 . for comparison , here we investigate the effect of galaxy mass limit in our simulation in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] . when we consider only the massive galaxies in haloes with @xmath104 , then @xmath18 decreases for dlas with a similar slope to the all - halo case , and @xmath18 is significantly lower and more flattened for the lls . integrating @xmath18 over the column density range of lls , we find that the contribution from the massive galaxies to the line density of llss is only @xmath1920% of the total .",
    "we confirm that the llss mainly come from lower - mass galaxies , and the discrepancy of @xmath18 with observation at lls range in @xcite is probably due to the mass limit of their galaxy sample .    in addition",
    ", we compute the @xmath18 using only the star - forming galaxies in our simulations , and find that the result is in - between the all - halo case and only massive galaxy case .",
    "this result suggest that llss mainly originate from lower mass galaxies in haloes with @xmath108 and lower star formation rate .",
    "we will discuss this point more quantitatively in section  [ sec : typical ] .",
    "next we perform direct radiation transfer calculation of uvb to validate the results of the otuv run .",
    "we perform this calculations by irradiating uvb from the boundary surfaces of calculation boxes with @xmath109 rays , and also consider the stellar radiation transfer simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammauvb ] shows the photoionization rate versus gas density in each grid cell from direct uvb transfer calculation .",
    "here we pick four halos randomly from the halo sample of @xmath110 in the otuv run , and recompute the transfer of uvb directly in each cell as shown by the red points .",
    "the higher mass haloes are excluded from our sample , because the uvb rt calculation takes too long to process such a large grid ( @xmath111100@xmath112 ) with current computers .",
    "the red points in the figure are derived from the rt calculations including both the uvb and stellar radiation . the black dashed and blue solid lines are the photoionization rates by the optically - thin model and the otuv model , respectively , obtained from the equilibrium calculation .",
    "note that the photoionization rate in this figure is of uvb radiation , @xmath67 in equation ( 1 ) , not including stellar radiation @xmath68 .",
    "we find that the @xmath113 has a relatively sharp transition from a high plateau at low densities to a much lower value at @xmath114 , and the self - shielding threshold density ( @xmath115@xmath51 , indicated by the blue solid line ) adopted in the otuv model correctly captures this sharp transition .",
    "the value of @xmath116 was determined by @xcite by examining the agreement with the observed data on @xmath18 , and one of the main purposes of this paper is to validate this choice of @xmath116 through direct rt calculations as demonstrated here .",
    "@xcite also gave some justification for this particular choice of @xmath116 , referring to prior radiative transfer simulations .",
    "in addition , the adopted threshold density is close to that of @xcite , who suggested the density threshold model based on the tight relation between column density and density .",
    "the region with @xmath117 mainly contributes to the column density of @xmath118 , which can self - shield from uvb .",
    "some limited number of cells at @xmath119 for halos a & c show relatively high values of @xmath120 , deviating from the main photoionized branch of gas .",
    "these are cells that are probably ionized by the local stellar radiation , and therefore allows uvb to penetrate into deeper densities . in some regions near star - clusters",

    "however , the impact is not so significant for a statistical quantity such as @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : cdfall ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvbcom]a shows the neutral fraction of hydrogen gas ( @xmath121 ) in each cell as a function of number density for the same four halos shown in figure  [ fig : gammauvb ] . in halos a and c , the stellar radiation boosts the ionization degree than the optically - thin equilibrium values , populating the red points below the black dashed curve . in halo b and d ,",
    "the young star clusters are distributed in high - density peaks , hence most ionizing photons are absorbed on the spot .",
    "in addition , the neutral fraction @xmath121 in low density region is approximately fitted by @xmath122 , therefore the neutral fraction is simply proportional to the number density of hydrogen . in addtion , we calculate the neutral fraction with different ionization processes ( green : uvb only , magenta : uvb + collisional ionization , and red : uvb + stellar radiation + collisional ionization ) .",
    "it shows that the collision boosts the ionization degree at @xmath123 ( magenta points extending below the dashed curve ) , and the stellar radiation boosts the ionization degree even at higher density regions , as signified by the wide distribution of red points below the dashed curve .",
    "we can further understand the transition from ionized to neutral state by solving for the balance between photoionization by stars and recombination in the one - zone approximation , picturing the gas clumps near young star clusters . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvbcom]b , we estimate the photoionization rate by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the emissivity of ionizing photons from star clusters , @xmath126 is the ionization cross section at the lyman limit , @xmath127 is the distance between star clusters and gas clumps . the optical depth @xmath128 is roughly estimated by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number density of neutral hydrogen of the gas clump .",
    "the @xmath125 of a star cluster in our simulations can be @xmath131s@xmath17 , and the distance @xmath127 can be proper @xmath132kpc , corresponding to the cell size of rt calculation in our simulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvbcom]b , the neutral fraction steeply rises at the density where @xmath128 becomes @xmath133 .",
    "with increasing photon emissivity , the threshold density moves to a higher density as the radiation is able to sink into higher densities , and the ionization degree at lower densities become stronger . with the above parameter values , we find that the star clusters can not ionize gas clumps with @xmath134 . in our simulations ,",
    "the gas density near star clusters can be @xmath135@xmath51 in massive halos and block the ionizing radiation from stars . from these analyses of uvb radiation transfer , we confirm that the stellar radiation does not strongly affect the neutral fraction of high - density gas at @xmath136 , and the uvb treatment of the otuv run is reasonable .",
    "once the hi  column density of each cell in the projected plane is obtained , we can estimate the dla cross - section of each halo by counting the number of grid - cells that exceed @xmath137@xmath23 and multiplying by the unit area @xmath138 of the grid - cell . in this paper",

    "we select the galaxies with young stars from each run , and compute the rt of local stellar sources .",
    "we find that the cross section increases with increasing halo mass for both dlas and llss in all uvb models .",
    "for a quantitative discussion , we plot the median value in each bin with a triangle symbol , and then fit a power law @xmath143 , assuming a functional form of @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the dark matter halo mass in units of solar masses , and the values of slope @xmath0 and normalization @xmath146 are determined by least - square fitting .",

    "the otuv run has much higher cross sections than in the hm0.5 run , because the high - density clouds with @xmath148 are the main contributor to @xmath139 , and the otuv model increases the neutral fraction of such gas over the optically - thin approximation .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath146 for the otuv run is much higher than that of hm0.5 run , but the slope is similar in all runs with @xmath149 for dlas .",

    "this implies that the high - density gas with @xmath148 is not responsible for the lls .",
    "the hm0.5 run has a slightly higher @xmath140 than the optically - thin run as expected .",
    "we also find that the slope @xmath0 is systematically shallower for the llss compared to that of dlas , and the normalization @xmath146 is higher for the llss .",

    "the red points are the mean value in each bin with the bin size of 0.5 dex . ]      in figure  [ fig : sigma_com_model ] , we compare the results of dla cross section from several authors using different simulations @xcite .",
    "although there are small differences in the slope and normalization , most of the results are bracketed by our no - uvb run and optically - thin run .",
    "there are significant overlap between the results of our otuv run , @xcite , @xcite , and the ww ( weak wind ) model of @xcite , which is very encouraging .",
    "@xcite considered a crude self - shielding model , so it is natural that their result is close to the otuv run .",
    "although @xcite also set the self - shielding threshold density criteria above which uvb can not penetrate , their @xmath116 is about one magnitude higher than our value .",
    "hence , their sw ( strong wind ) model should give lower @xmath139 than our otuv run .",

    "the difference between the sw and ww model of @xcite is consistent with the results of @xcite .    using an enzo amr simulation",
    ", @xcite reported a much higher @xmath139 than other simulations for halos with @xmath157 , and the reason for this difference is not very clear",
    ". some of the possibilities are : 1 ) their star formation model is considerably inefficient in converting the neutral gas into stars , 2 ) their self - shielding treatment is allowing too much neutral gas in massive halos , and/or 3 ) their stellar feedback is inefficient and does not heat up the ambient neutral gas .",
    "they used only two zoom - in simulations ( a high - density cluster region and a low - density void region ) to bracket the mean density result , therefore they only bracketed the observed @xmath18 without reproducing the normalization of @xmath18 .",
    "it appears that his result is more consistent with that of our no - uv run rather than the otuv run .",
    "we find that the fumagalli s fit to the @xmath139 for low - mass halos is much steeper than other simulations , which could be due to a small galaxy sample in their zoom - in simulations ( only seven galaxies ) .",
    "we discussed the effect of limited galaxy sample already in   [ sec : fn ] and figure  [ fig : cdfall ] .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : dlacom ] compares the ratio of dla and lls cross section with and without stellar radiation .",

    "the slope @xmath0 and normalization @xmath146 for the power - law fit are very similar in the two cases of with and without the stellar rt .",
    "since young stars distribute near high - density gas clumps , most of ionizing photons from stars are blocked by the gas clumps , and the region behind high - density gas clumps are not irradiated by the stellar radiation . as a result , the stellar radiation can not propagate over long distances in the halo , and the stellar radiation does not affect the hi  cross section very much in high - mass halos .",
    "in addition , although relative mass of neutral hydrogen gas to stellar mass somewhat decreases as increasing halo mass , the amount of dense gas clouds around star - forming regions increases with halo mass by frequent minor merging processes ( e.g. , figure  1  in * ? ? ?",
    "the photon absorption process and the distribution of stars and gas are determined by complicated nonlinear process , which can be traced by cosmological hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : dlacom ] shows the ratio of hi  mass in each halo with ( @xmath153 ) and without ( @xmath154 ) the stellar rt , i.e. , @xmath155 .",
    "it shows that the lower mass halos lose more hi  masses than the higher mass halos , consistently with figure  [ fig : dlacom ] .",
    "the hi  mass is reduced by about 30 per cent by the stellar rt for halos with @xmath158 , while it is only about 7 per cent reduction for higher mass halos with @xmath159 .",
    "some analytical works discussed the relative strength of local stellar radiation to uvb under the assumption of simple gas distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the effect of stellar radiation is negligible compared to uvb for llss , and that it can be comparable for dlas as an upper limit . on the other hand",
    ", the model by @xcite indicated that the local stellar radiation can be dominant even for llss , as well as for dlas .",
    "however , for inhomogeneous gas distribution , the effect of stellar radiation strongly depends on the structure of gas around stars , and it requires rt simulations for proper assessment .",
    "the above analytical works did not discuss the direct impact of local stellar radiation on dla / lls cross sections and @xmath18 , and focused only on the _ relative _ strength between local stellar radiation and uvb . in our simulations ,",
    "the ionizing flux from local stars can be much higher than the uvb similarly to the previous analytic estimates .",
    "however , the neutral clouds survive from ionization by self - shielding and shadowing effect ( see fig.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the local stellar radiation can not change the ionization structure in galaxies very much ( particularly in massive galaxies ) , and hence the hi  cross section does not change largely . on the other hand , the uvb enter from outside the halo into low - density region , therefore they can irradiate over greater volume .",
    "as we see in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] , the uvb can drastically change the rate - of - incidence of dlas and llss . in this subsection",
    ", we investigate how the uvb and stellar radiation change the spatial distribution of @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig : column ] shows the two dimensional map of @xmath20 distribution for four halos in the otuv run at @xmath1 .",

    "the column ( @xmath162 ) is with the stellar rt in addition .",
    "the column ( @xmath163 ) is the same as column ( @xmath162 ) , but for the same halo in the optically - thin run .    comparing columns ( @xmath160 ) and ( @xmath161 ) , we see that the uvb changes the @xmath20 distribution drastically .",
    "much of the llss in the outer region are ionized by the uvb and becomes lower than @xmath164@xmath23 .",
    "the higher columns with @xmath165 survive from photo - ionization by uvb because of the high recombination rate in high density regions , but the dla cross section is significantly reduced .",
    "the dlas correspond to the yellow and red regions in figure  [ fig : column ] .",
    "the dla distribution does not change very much from column ( @xmath161 ) to ( @xmath162 ) , and it is not affected by the stellar rt very much as we discussed in   [ sec : stellarrt ] .",
    "comparison of columns ( @xmath162 ) and ( @xmath163 ) reveals the effect of optically - thin approximation of uvb in the optically - thin run relative to the self - shielding effect in the otuv run .",
    "it shows that the uvb photo - ionizes the gas too deeply in the optically - thin approximation , and the self - shielding model increases the dla cross section significantly . from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : fn ] , we argue that column ( @xmath162 ) is more realistic than column ( @xmath163 ) based on the comparison of @xmath18 .    in the otuv run ( column [ @xmath162 ] ) , dlas are extended over @xmath167kpc scales in all halos , which is a stark contrast to the very compact appearance in the optically - thin run ( column [ @xmath163 ] ) , and the llss are surrounding dlas on @xmath3kpc scales .",
    "@xcite showed the dla distribution similar to the column ( @xmath163 ) in their sph simulations with optically - thin approximation and argued that dla distribution is very clumpy .",
    "however based on the present work , it seems that dlas are more broadly and smoothly distributed around lbgs at @xmath1 on @xmath167kpc scales .",
    "the highest column density systems with @xmath169@xmath23 are preserved well even in the optically - thin run , as we saw in figure  [ fig : cdfall ] .        to quantify the relative distribution of dlas , llss and galaxies in different uvb models , we compute the impact parameter distribution of dlas / llss relative to galaxies in each run . figure  [ fig : pdf ] shows the cumulative probability distribution function ( pdf ) of dlas and llss as a function of separation distance ( i.e. impact parameter ) between dlas ( llss ) and the center - of - mass of nearest galaxy in projected 2d plane in physical unit .",
    "the colored lines are from the simulations used in this paper .",
    "the otuv run shows a much shallower pdf than the optically - thin run .",
    "about fifty per cent of dlas in the otuv run distribute within @xmath170  kpc from galaxy center , while those in the optically - thin run are concentrated within @xmath171  kpc .",
    "this is because the uvb can not penetrate deeper into the galaxy center due to self - shielding , and hydrogen gas near galaxy center can survive as dlas . of course , no - uvb run has the widest pdf due to the overproduction of dlas as noted earlier in this paper .",
    "in addition , we compare the results with different galactic wind models . as described in section 2.1 , we use the `` multi - component variable velocity '' ( mvv ) wind model of @xcite in the current simulations .",
    "some previous works used the constant - velocity wind ( cw ) model .",
    "the black dashed and solid lines are the pdfs from the cw model + optically - thin uvb approximation ( p3 run in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cw+otuv run @xcite , respectively .",
    "we find that the dlas in the cw model are concentrated near the galaxy center more than the mvv model . in the cw model ,",
    "the lower mass galaxies have higher wind velocities than in the mvv run @xcite , therefore the dlas abundance is somewhat suppressed .",
    "in such a situation , only high - density gas around galaxy center can survive as dlas , resulting in a steeper pdf . in the case of llss ,",
    "the pdfs are in general much wider than those of dlas.      we show the projected maps of stellar mass , @xmath20 , and metallicity in figure  [ fig : mtl ] .",
    "we find a strong correlation between high-@xmath20 systems and stellar mass distribution as expected .",
    "the metallicity map is obtained by summing up all metal mass along each line - of - sight and dividing by the total gas mass in the same sight - line .",
    "the high density region is effectively enriched by the metals created by sne .",
    "the massive halos ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show high metallicities around the high density regions and dlas .",

    "the effect of wind appears stronger in halos ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , but this is simply due to the smaller physical scale of the panels for halos ( 3 ) & ( 4 ) compared to ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) .",
    "careful examination shows that halos ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) also show a similar degree of circumgalactic enrichment as halos ( 3 ) & ( 4 ) .",
    "for example , for halo ( 1 ) there is a bubble of sub-@xmath173 gas extending toward north - east direction , about 60kpc away from the center of galaxy on the right - hand - side . for halo ( 2 ) , a similar feature can be seen for a near-@xmath173 gas extending out towards north - east direction , again about 60kpc away from the center of galaxy on the right - hand - side . for halo ( 3 )",

    ", a similar feature can be seen towards north direction . for halos ( 1)@xmath174(3 ) ,",
    "notice that the direction of wind propagation is nearly perpendicular to the chain of galaxy distribution .",
    "our mvv wind model reproduces the observed scaling between wind velocity and galaxy sfr : @xmath175 , which allows greater wind velocity for more massive galaxies .",
    "this is compensated by the deeper potential well of more massive galaxies , therefore the enriched metals reach similar distances for all halos as we discussed above .",
    "the bottom two rows of figure  [ fig : mtl ] also show the virial radius of each halo in white circles .",
    "one can see that the dlas are about the same or slightly smaller than the virial radius , whereas the metal enrichment clearly goes beyond the virial radius . for halos ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) , there are two major galaxies in these massive halos , and each of the galaxies is a host of dlas that extends to the scale of virial radius .          using the fitting function of dla cross section derived in   [ sec :",
    "sigma ] , we are now able to estimate the cumulative number of dlas per unit redshift . however , there is the mass - resolution limit in a simulation , and we can not resolve the lower mass haloes that may be dlas host .",

    "in addition , it is hard to produce very massive halos in a limited simulation volume . to overcome this resolution limit ,",

    "@xcite concluded that @xmath210 per cent of the dlas in sdss dr7 cause significant reddening .",
    "it is unclear if this reddened population can explain the discrepancy we see in the pdf , but it will bring the two distributions closer .",
    "the dashed histograms are the pdfs in the optically thin run .",
    "although @xmath18 significantly changes with the uvb model , the typical physical quantities do not change very much .",
    "as we see in figure  [ fig : sigmauv ] , @xmath146 in the fitting function ( equation 5 ) changes with the uvb model , while the power - law slope @xmath0 does not change largely . in our simulations ,",
    "the physical quantities are roughly proportional to halo mass .",
    "therefore , the typical physical quantities do not depend on the uvb model very much .",
    "figure  [ fig : crossdistlls ] shows the pdf of @xmath140 .",
    "the shape of pdf is basically similar to that of @xmath139 .",
    "however , in the case of llss , the contribution from lower mass ( and hence lower sfr and lower @xmath211 ) haloes becomes greater than for dlas .",
    "the median values are : @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "about 80 per cent of total @xmath140 come from haloes with @xmath13 .",
    "hence the majority of llss are hosted by the low - mass halos with lbgs that are fainter than the current observational limit .",

    "we examined the physical properties of dlas and llss at @xmath1 using cosmological sph simulations .",
    "in particular , we studied the impact of radiative transfer of uvb and local stellar radiation on dlas and llss .",
    "our major findings are as follows :    * the otuv simulation with a self - shielding density threshold of @xmath219@xmath51 for the uvb can reproduce the observed @xmath18 very well ( figure  [ fig : cdfall ] ) , compared to the run with optically - thin approximation ( the optically - thin run ) .",
    "we have presented this result earlier @xcite , and in this paper we further validated the adopted value of @xmath116 by the direct rt calculations .",
    "similar results have been obtained various authors to a varying degree @xcite . + as we showed in figs .",
    "[ fig : gammauvb ] , & [ fig : uvbcom ] , the above value of @xmath116 captures the rapid change in the ionization fraction in halo gas very well . in the optically - thin run ,",
    "the uvb sinks too deeply into the halo gas and ionizes gas too much , resulting in the underestimate of @xmath18 .",
    "given that it is still difficult to perform rt calculations simultaneously with hydrodynamics in current cosmological simulations , our otuv model provides a useful prescription for any cosmological simulations that can not resolve the self - shielding by molecular gas on sub - kpc scales .",
    "* we find that the local stellar radiation does not strongly affect the distribution of dlas / llss , and @xmath18 does not change very much by the stellar rt ( figure  [ fig : cdfall ] ) .",
    "this is because clumpy high - density clouds near young star clusters effectively absorb most of the ionizing photons from young stars @xcite . the effect of stellar rt is stronger on the lower mass halos , and the reduction in @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    "were shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dlacom ] .",
    "* we compared the dla / lls cross sections in simulations with different uvb models ( figure  [ fig : sigmauv ] ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the no - uvb run gives the highest dla / lls cross sections as expected , and it overpredicts the rate - of - incidence and the column density distribution . for",
    "the dlas , the otuv run gives intermediate @xmath139 values , and the hm0.5 & optically - thin run give the lowest @xmath139 .",
    "the similarity of the latter two runs tells us that the gas becomes highly ionized under the optically thin run , no matter what the exact uvb amplitude is . for the llss ,",
    "the latter three runs ( otuv , opticall - thin , and hm0.5 ) all give similar @xmath140 , and the self - shielding model does not matter for llss , as they are in the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "* we compared the results of dla cross section from various authors and simulations ( figure  [ fig : sigma_com_model ] ) .",
    "there are some general agreement in the sense that most results are bracketed by our opticall - thin run and the no - uvb run , and that both @xmath139 and @xmath140 increases with increasing halo mass . however , there is still significant scatter between different authors .",
    "the origin of the differences could be a combination of many things , such as different models of star formation , galactic wind , uvb and self - shielding treatment .",
    "for example , the stronger wind model can sweep high - density gas clouds out of star - forming regions , and decrease dla cross section .",
    "the self - shielding model of uvb can increase the dla cross section compared to the optically - thin method , and rate of increase can be different according to the threshold density for self - shielding .",
    "we have chosen the appropriate value of @xmath116 based on the good match to the observed @xmath18 and through the validation by direct radiative transfer calculation . *",
    "the cumulative number of dlas per unit redshift strongly depends on the uvb models ( figure  [ fig : dndz ] ) .",
    "the otuv run agrees well with the observed data . on the other hand , the no - uvb run overproduces dlas .",
    "the optically - thin and hm0.5 runs underpredict the observation . *",
    "the visual appearance of dlas and llss is quite different in the otuv and optically - thin runs ( figure  [ fig : column ] & [ fig : mtl ] ) . in the otuv run ,",
    "the dlas have an extended distribution around star - forming regions on typically @xmath2kpc scales , and llss are surrounding dlas on @xmath3kpc scales .",
    "as shown in the middle row of figure  [ fig : mtl ] , the extent of dlas are typically smaller than the virial radius of the halo , and the llss are about the same size as the virial radius . given the good agreement between the otuv run and the observations of @xmath18 , we consider that these are the most realistic distribution of dlas and llss in our simulation set .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the optically - thin run , the uvb penetrates deeply , ionizes the hydrogen gas effectively , and reduces the column density significantly . as a result ,",
    "most of the region around star - forming galaxies turn into llss , and the dlas shrink and become compact .",
    "this striking effect of optically - thin approximation is highlighted by the comparison of columns ( @xmath162 ) and ( @xmath163 ) in figure  [ fig : column ] , suggesting the importance of self - shielding effect .",
    "the present work supersedes the previous work of @xcite , which reported clumpy distribution of dla gas in haloes at @xmath1 . with",
    "the proper treatment of self - shielding as in the otuv run , the dlas have more extended distribution around star - forming galaxies on @xmath220kpc scales .",
    "+ we quantified the above features in the pdfs of impact parameters between dlas / llss and the nearest galaxies . as expected , we find a much wider distribution for the otuv run than for the optically - thin run . *",
    "we examined the pdf of dla / lls cross sections as functions of halo mass , sfr , stellar mass , and metallicity ( figures  [ fig : crossdistdla ] and [ fig : crossdistlls ] ) .",
    "the median values of distributions are summarized in table  [ table : median ] .",
    "about 30 per cent of dlas are hosted by galaxies having @xmath8 , which is the typical sfr range for lbgs .",
