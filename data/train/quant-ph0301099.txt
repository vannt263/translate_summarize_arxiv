    "the experimental analysis of the intriguing properties of entanglement in quantum mechanics requires the availability of stable sources of entanglement . despite the nice properties exhibited by entanglement",
    ", it has the odd behaviour of degrading by the unavoidable contact with the external environment .",
    "thus , for the entanglement to be assessed as a precious mean , we must devise some method to pump it up to the entanglement source in order to sustain a prescribed degree of entanglement that we may need whether for quantum communication protocols ( teleportation , cryptography , dense coding ) or quantum computing ( algorithmics ) ( for a review see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "quantum distillation or purification protocols are precisely those methods , that have been devised to regenerate entanglement leakages of an entanglement source . here",
    "we are interested in the purification of mixed states of bipartite type , having in mind the realization of a communication protocol by two parties , alice and bob .",
    "the seminal work of @xcite has provided us with a standard distillation method that has been the focus to developing more protocols with the aim at improving its original performances .",
    "we shall refer to this distillation protocol as the bbpssw protocol .",
    "there are feasible experimental proposals for this type of protocols using polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) @xcite .",
    "likewise , there also exist methods for the distillation of pure states @xcite that have been implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition to the initial purpose for which the quantum distillation protocols were devised , they have found another very important application in connection to the problem of quantum error correction : quantum information needs to be protected from errors even more than classical information due to its tendency to become decoherent . to avoid these errors , one can resort to the ideas of quantum error correction codes @xcite , @xcite and fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite , @xcite . however , entanglement purification is another alternative to decoherence which gives a more powerful way of dealing with errors in quantum communication @xcite .    in a typical quantum communication experiment ,",
    "alice and bob are two spatially separated parties sharing pairs of entangled qubits .",
    "the type of operations allowed on these qubits are denoted as locc ( local operations and classical communication ) : they comprise local unitary operators @xmath1 on each side , local quantum measurements and communication of the measurement results through a classical channel .",
    "these local quantum operations will suffer from imperfections producing local errors .",
    "futhermore , alice and bob will also face transmission errors in their quantum channels due to dissipation and noise . to overcome these difficulties , they will have to set up an entanglement purification method .",
    "in short , a protocol like the bbpssw creates a reduced set of maximally entangled pairs ( within a certain accuracy ) out of a larger set of imperfectly entangled pairs : entanglement is created at the expense of wasting extra pairs .",
    "the degree of purity of a mixed entangled pair is measured in terms of its fidelity with respect to a maximally entangled pure pair , which is the focus of the purification protocol .",
    "after the bbpssw protocol , a new distillation protocol was introduced in @xcite by the name of quantum privacy amplification(qpa ) which converges much faster to the desired fidelity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other protocols known as quantum repeaters @xcite , @xcite allow us to stablish quantum communication over long distances by avoiding absortion or depolarization errors that scale exponentially with the length of the quantum channel .",
    "the advantages of dealing with @xmath0-dimensional or multilevel quantum states ( qudits ) instead of qubits are quite apparent : an increase in the information flux through the communication channels that could speed up quantum cryptography , etc . @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been quite natural to propose extensions of the purification protocols for qudits .",
    "one of the proposals @xcite relies on an extension of the cnot gate that is unitary , but not hermitian .",
    "recently , another very nice proposal has been introduced @xcite , @xcite based on a generalization of the cnot gate that is both unitary and hermitian and gives a higher convergence . in this paper",
    "we make a study of the new purification protocols of @xcite , @xcite when they are applied to mixed bipartite states of qudits that are not of the werner form . in this way , we combine some of the tools employed by the qpa protocols @xcite with the advantages of the new methods .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we review simple distillation protocols for qubits not in werner states and we generalize them for the purification of any of the bell states . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we extend the previous protocols to deal with multilevel qubits and obtain several results like an improvement in the size of the stability fidelity basin , analytical formulas for the distillation flows , phase diagrams , etc . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we apply the distillation protocols for the purification of non - diagonal mixed states that are more easily realized experimentally . in sect .",
    "[ sec5 ] we study the large-@xmath0 limit of these protocols . in sect .",
    "[ sec6 ] we present a detailed investigation of the relationships between quantum distillation protocols and renormalization methods for quantum lattice hamiltonians .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] is devoted to conclusions . in appendix  [ app ]",
    "we find the general solution for the distillation recursion relations used in the text in the general case of qudits .",
    "our starting point is the orthonormal basis of bell states formed by the first qubit belonging to alice and the second to bob : @xmath2\\\\ \\ket{\\psi^{\\pm } } & : = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\ket{01}\\pm \\ket{10 } ] \\end{split } \\label{s1}\\ ] ] we shall use the word `` simple '' applied to the distillation protocols to denote that the mixed state we shall be dealing with is made up of a combination of one state in the set @xmath3 of bell states that have coincident bits in alice s and bob s qubits , with another state in the set @xmath4 of bell states that do not have coincidences .",
    "thus , we have 4 possible combinations to do this type of entanglement distillation .    to begin with",
    ", we shall choose the following mixed state in order to set up a simple distillation protocol @xmath5 alice and bob will also need to apply the cnot gate defined as usual @xmath6    the distillation protocol can be arranged into a set of 5 instructions or steps @xcite,@xcite,@xcite :    1",
    ".   set up @xmath7 with fidelity @xmath8 .",

    "go to step 1 ) with @xmath12 with fidelity @xmath13 .",
    "the simplicity of this protocol also relies on the fact that we do not need any depolarization step , as it is the case when dealing with werner states @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a schematic picture of a single aplication of the purification method .",
    "let us comment on the outcomes corresponding to the most relevant steps in this protocol .",
    "after step 1/ , the 4-quit mixed state @xmath14 shared by alice and bob reads as follows @xmath15 \\\\   & + ( 1-f)^2\\ket{\\psi^{+}\\psi^{+}}\\bra{\\psi^{+}\\psi^{+ } } \\end{split } \\label{s3}\\ ] ] in step 2/ , alice and bob apply bilaterally the cnot gate taking their first qubit as source and their second qubit as target , i.e. , qubits first and third are source qubits while qubits second and fourth are target qubits . to obtain",
    "the transformed mixed state we must determine the action of the bilateral cnot gate @xmath9 @xcite on the states of the form @xmath16 .",
    "the results of this computation are shown in table  [ table1 ] . with the help of this table",

    "this fact selects the state @xmath18 as the only admissible possibility for the target state .",
    "thus , only the first and third terms in the rhs of ( [ s4 ] ) survive to this process and the resulting 2-qubit state @xmath19 is again of the same form as the original starting state ( [ s2 ] ) in step 1/ , but with a higher fidelity @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , we get @xmath20 with the new fidelity being @xmath21 this relation defines a recursion scheme for entanglement purification : starting with say @xmath22 pairs of bell states of fidelity @xmath8 , after every application of the whole protocol we obtain @xmath23 pairs of higher fidelity @xmath13 .",
    "thus , purification is achieved at the expense of halving the number of bell pairs .",
    "the fixed points @xmath24 of the recursion relation ( [ s6 ] ) are defined as @xmath25 and they are given by @xmath26 .",
    "the fixed points @xmath27 are stable , while @xmath28 is unstable .",
    "the best way to recast these qualitative properties of the flow equation for the fidelities ( [ s6 ] ) is to draw the corresponding flow diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ flowdiagram ] .",
    ".this table shows the results of applying the bilateral cnot gate to certain pairs of bell states needed to distillation .",

    "therefore , the qrg is an energy minimization procedure .",
    "likewise , the purification process produces a protocol for fidelity maximization along with a distillation - flow diagram .",

    "the field of quantum distillation protocols has become very active in the theory of quantum information due to the central role played by entanglement in the quantum communication procedures and its tendency to degradation .    in this work",
    "we have been interested in several extensions of the purification protocols when dealing with multilevel systems ( qudits ) instead of the more usual qubit protocols .",
    "we have seen the various advantages of having distillation methods for qudits systems as compared with the simple case of qubits .",
    "we have also obtained the general form of the solution to the distillation recursion relations and several particular solutions have been studied explicitly .",
    "we have developed the relationship between quantum distillation protocols and quantum renormalization group methods , something which is interesting in itself and could serve as a guide for possible extension of purification methods .",
    "we would like to mention that the possibility of working with qudits systems has become quite realistic in the recent years .",
    "for instance , it is possible to realize multilevel systems in terms of the orbital angular momentum of photons , instead of the more standard polarization ( qubit ) degree of freedom @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "yet another possibility is to use the so called multiport beam splitters @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are several ways in which this work can be extended .",
    "one is the consideration of noise as as source of errors during the distillation protocol itself .",
    "another one is to allow the possibility of having these distillation protocols for qudits be embedded into a quantum repeater protocol @xcite , @xcite .    _",

    "in this appendix , we look for more general solutions to the general distillation recursion relations ( [ g14 ] ) than those studied in section  [ sec3 ] . to this end , it is convenient to introduce auxiliary variables @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 so that the real weights @xmath36 are related to these auxiliary variables as @xmath37 thus , @xmath34 are unnormalized probability weights .",
