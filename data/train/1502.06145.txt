    "the bethe or bethe - like recursive lattices generally refer to the fractal arrangements of repeating units recursively connected to neighbors only on the sharing vertex , with no connection bond lies crossing layers .",
    "it has become a powerful methodology in various fields such as thermodynamics @xcite , graph theory@xcite , optimization problems @xcite and so on . in statistical physics , one important application of the recursive lattice is to approximate the regular lattice with the identical coordination number to solve a thermodynamic system ( e.g. ising model ) on it . as one of few exactly calculable models , it has been proven to be a reliable method @xcite , with the advantage of exact calculation and simple iterative approach @xcite , to be applied in numerous physical systems , e.g. alloy @xcite , spin glass @xcite , polymers @xcite , biomacromolecule @xcite etc .    as a versatile extension of the bethe lattice assembled by single dots and bonds , the husimi lattice employing simple geographic shapes , such as square , triangle , tetrahedron , hexagon , or cube",
    "@xcite has also been developed for decades to describe various systems with particular geographic properties @xcite .",
    "similar to the bethe lattice , the independence feature of units enables the exact calculation on husimi lattice regardless of the dimensions of the geographic unit , and mean field approximation is unnecessary since the interactions are confined within a unit and not shared by others .",
    "the calculation method usually relies on the recursive approach , which is featured as simple and less computation effort costing thanks to the homogeneous self - similar structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the recursive feature is accompanied with several disadvantages of this lattice methodology .",
    "firstly , the repeating structure implies a homogeneous system , it is only suitable to describe systems of uniform texture . some particular however important cases , e.g. the confined geometry or structural transformation , are enormously difficult , if not impossible , to be simulated by the recursive lattices .",
    "therefore , besides a few investigations on the thermodynamics on the surface / thin film employed moderately inhomogeneous structure to present the boundary of a bulk system@xcite , the reports on the application of recursive lattice onto inhomogeneous systems were very rare .",
    "secondly , recursive lattice is considered to be a reliable approximation to regular lattice based on the identical coordination number @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the manipulation of coordination number(s ) is critical in constructing a recursive lattice for particular requirements .",
    "while it is easy to draw a regular lattice with an arbitrary @xmath4 , achieving an odd @xmath4 in recursive lattice usually requires awkward design of unit selection and branch number , and even worse a prime number of @xmath4 is impossible .",
    "furthermore , when the randomness is necessary in a recursive lattice model , the common method is to add random terms in the hamiltonian , e.g. a random external field as noise or random exchange couplings parameter @xmath5 @xcite , while the structural randomness is difficult to be presented due to the homogeneity of recursions .",
    "therefore , it is expected to be a considerable contribution to this field that if new designs of recursive lattice and calculation methods are developed to handle the above concerns , and make the recursive methodology more versatile in describing inhomogeneous systems .",
    "recently we reported an husimi lattice of random square - cube recursion , on which the simple ising model can be solved by conventional exact calculation technique with moderate modification and exhibits well - defined thermal behaviors @xcite .",
    "following the same principle , in this work we have developed a randomly multi - branched husimi square lattice and solved the simple ferromagnetic ising model on it .",
    "the lattice is featured by randomly two or three square units connected on one vertex , then an inhomogeneous system of variable coordination numbers can be achieved with the identical unit cells . the spontaneous magnetization with critical temperature @xmath6",
    ", thermodynamics around the singularity , and the thermal fluctuation caused by stochastic structure , were investigated with the variation of structural ratio .",
    "the original husimi lattice was a tree - like graph assembled by squares with two units connecting on one vertex . since its development , derivative structures of three and more squares connection have been also investigated . in this way , to achieve an inhomogeneous structure with variable @xmath4",
    ", it is a natural choice to have random number of branches connected in the lattice . to keep the investigation simple , in this work we will only study the randomly 2 or 3-branched husimi square lattice with @xmath7 or @xmath8 as demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a structural ratio @xmath0 or @xmath1 can be defined to indicate the probability to have 2 or 3 branches on one vertex , with obviously @xmath2 . however , as a probable reason why this type of lattice has not been reported before , the random structure destroys the recursive homogeneity and then makes the iterative approach unfeasible , therefore the lattice shown in fig.[fig1 ] is not the actual model studied in this paper , and particular limitations on the structure must be applied to achieve an exact calculation , which will be detailed later .",
    "while the branch number is randomly 2 or 3 in this lattice , with the structural ratio @xmath3 we can define an  analog branch number \" as @xmath9 to present the average branch number of the lattice , and similarly an analog coordination number @xmath4 can also be defined as @xmath10 . by this means",
    ", the term  cross - dimensional \" in this paper refers to the gradient of analog @xmath4 : taking a finite regular cubic lattice with a 2d surface as an example , we have @xmath11 on the surface and @xmath12 in the bulk , then in the near - surface region a randomly sampled site will has a probability to be of either @xmath4 depending on the depth .",
    "therefore , a gradually variation of analog @xmath4 from 5 to 6 well represents the cross - dimensional range from the surface to bulk in this case .",
    "similarly , the case of a 2d layer crossing to thin film can be described by the variation of analog @xmath4 from 4 to 6 . for an additional clarification ,",
    "both 3-branched husimi square lattice and husimi cubic lattice have been proved to be a good approximation to the regular cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the simplest ferromagnetic spin@xmath13 ising model was applied on the lattice in this paper : @xmath14 without external magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "the weights of one configuration @xmath16 of a square unit is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reversal temperature as @xmath19 , the boltzmann constant @xmath20 is set as one .",
    "we have the partition function of the entire system as @xmath21 where the @xmath22 denotes the state of the lattice as an ensemble of unit @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we setup a uniform ferromagnetic coupling @xmath24 , then the state of system only depends on the structural properties . without external magnetic field , we can expect a half - half probability of spin state on each site at high temperature , a uniform orientation pointing to either up or down of all spins at low temperature , and a spontaneous magnetization occurring in between .",
    "the only question being focused on in this paper is that , how this transition behaves in the cross - dimensional situation on an inhomogeneous lattice .",
    "the lattice is designed of infinite size , nevertheless for an iterative approach it is necessary to imagine an original point where the entire lattice contribute to .",
    "furthermore , the structure must be symmetrical to the original point , and subsequently the symmetry of sub - trees contributing onto one unit is required , otherwise the unique structure of an arbitrary sub - tree is impossible to be tracked and accounted in iterative calculation .",
    "therefore , the unlimited random structure shown in fig.[fig1 ] is not the actual lattice we are going to study , and two important principles have to be settled here : 1 ) the branch number on the vertices of one unit must be the same excluding the base vertex ; 2 ) for any arbitrary square the three sub - trees contributing onto it towards to the original point should be identical . and the branch number on the vertices of different levels are random with the structural ratio @xmath3 . a sample structure is presented in the fig.[fig2]a .    although these two limitations confine a locally ordered configuration on the same levels and impair the randomness of the lattice , from a general view of the infinitely large structure , we still have two or three branched vertex randomly appears with a fixed probability .",
    "therefore , we may say that this paper discussed a special case of the ideally random multi - branched lattice with identical sub - trees contributions .",
    "the calculation method basically follows the previous works done by gujrati s @xcite , here we will briefly derive the method with specific modifications for the random - branched lattice . by defining the partition function of a sub - tree with the base spin fixed as @xmath25 or @xmath26 to be the partial partition function ( ppf ) , denoted as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the level of the base spin , at the original site @xmath29 ( level @xmath30 ) we have the total partition function :    @xmath31    the exponent @xmath32 is the number of sub - trees ( branches ) contributing onto @xmath33 . while in the regular lattice the branch number is a fixed variable , in this work the branch number is a series of random variables on each level , therefore the branch number shall be written as @xmath34 associated to the level @xmath28 .    as shown in fig.[fig2]a , for each square unit on level @xmath28 it always takes in @xmath35 sub - trees contributions from upper level and contribute itself to the unit on the lower level , then by defining @xmath36 , for the ppf on the level @xmath37 we have the recursive relations    @xmath38    @xmath39    with the sites labeling shown in fig.[fig2]a , on the two sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 neighboring to @xmath42 we have @xmath43 sub - trees contributing from level @xmath44 , and similar to the @xmath45 diagonal to @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 is the local weight of the square confined by the four sites @xmath42 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath45 . in principle",
    "this local weight should exclude the weights of base site @xmath42 , @xmath48 , to conduct a cavity field contribution , however this can be ignored since we set the external field @xmath49 in this paper .    with the ppfs defined above ,",
    "we introduce a ratio @xmath50 ( simplified as @xmath51 ) on the site @xmath46    @xmath52    as the weights ratio of ppfs with the fixed spin state of @xmath46 , @xmath53 denotes the sub - tree contribution to the magnetization field of the site @xmath46 , i.e. the cavity contribution @xcite .",
    "therefore this ratio can be treated as the  solution \" of the system to indicate the magnetization of a site .",
    "obviously , the solution of @xmath54 or @xmath55 indicates a uniform spins orientation to either up or down , and conversely the solution @xmath56 implies a half - half probability to have a up or down spin on one site , i.e. the amorphous state without external magnetic field .",
    "since @xmath51 is a function of ppfs on level @xmath37 , and as shown in eq.[ppf+_recursion ] and [ ppf-_recursion ] a ppf is a function of the ppfs on higher level , then @xmath51 can be derived as a function of @xmath53s on higher levels in a recursive fashion :    @xmath57    with an initial seeding input of @xmath58 , the solution can be obtained by applying the eq.[x_recursion ] many times until reaching a fixed - point solution . principally , various input seeds should be tried to exhaust all possible fixed points , however this work deals with the simplest ferromagnetic ising model , and a single solution at a fixed temperature is expected .    the exact form of eq.[x_recursion ]",
    "is derived below : starting from @xmath59 we define a compact note @xmath60{c}% x_{n}\\text { if } s_{n}=+1\\\\ y_{n}\\text { if } s_{n}=-1 \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of@xmath61 we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 where the sum is over @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and over @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and where @xmath68 it is related to the polynomials @xmath69 according to @xmath70 in terms of the above polynomials , we can express the recursive relation for the ratio @xmath51 in terms of @xmath71 : @xmath72    the above process is the static recursive calculation of solutions .",
    "for the random multi - branched lattice , on each iteration the program will randomly assign the value of @xmath73 to be 2 or 3 according to the structural ratio @xmath0 , and then execute the calculation for that local level .",
    "therefore , the solutions exhibit a fluctuation around an average value , and the fixed - point solution does not exist . according to our experience ,",
    "the calculation reaches a  stable \" solutions oscillation @xmath74 in no more than 2000 iterations . in the program we did the calculation 16,000 times and average the last 11,000 @xmath53s to reach a reliable @xmath75 . in this way , although the exact calculation is executed in each iteration , instead of exact results what we actually obtained is a numerical solution distribution .",
    "the thermodynamic calculations again follows the same principle detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a slight modification is necessary to fit the random conformation case .",
    "herein we firstly review the general method to calculate the free energy on a homogeneous @xmath32-branched husimi lattice .",
    "imagine we achieved the fixed - point solution in the region around the original point @xmath76 , the @xmath32 squares joint on @xmath76 are indexed as the first level , then there are @xmath77 squares on the level @xmath78 .",
    "now we cut off these sub - trees and hook them up to form @xmath79 smaller but identical lattices , the partition function of these lattices are @xmath80 the free energy of the left out local squares is @xmath81 we have @xmath82 cites in a square and @xmath73 squares in the local origin region .",
    "the free energy per site is:@xmath83 by substituting @xmath84 and @xmath85 we have @xmath86^{3b^{\\prime } } } ) .",
    "\\label{fe}\\ ] ]    an important concern in the inhomogeneous lattice discussed in this paper is that , the original point is merely a conceptual point that indicating the calculation direction , while it can not be realized as an either 2 or 3 branched point .",
    "therefore , the free energy of a local region should be calculated along the recursive process and averaged , in the same fashion of solutions , to approach the free energy of the whole system .    by this",
    "means , an replica counterpart calculation was designed to obtain the free energy along the recursive process , as shown in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "after the solution converged to the stable oscillation , once an iteration of solution was calculated on one site , the immediate calculation of free energy of that site was carried out by hooking an identical replica half - tree onto that site ( the shadow part in fig.[fig2]b ) .",
    "then as in a complete lattice with the replica counterpart , the central point can be taken as the ` origin ' and the general method of free energy calculation ( eq.[fe ] ) can be applied by cutting - off and rejoining the sub - trees on the corresponding sites @xmath87 and @xmath88 to yield the free energy of the local region .",
    "although this replica part does not exist in the system , due to the perfect symmetry it provides the correct free energy per site of the local region , and the value calculated on the real half is valid .",
    "we have also tested that , the branch number on the symmetric joint point does not affect the free energy calculation , i.e. hooking one or two imaginary counterparts onto the site to make @xmath89 or @xmath90 present the exact same free energy density , i.e. the thermodynamics only depends on the solution @xmath58 once it was determined .",
    "the average solution @xmath75 with @xmath91 is presented in fig.[fig3]a .",
    "the solution of deterministic cases of @xmath92 and 3 with @xmath93 and 0 are also shown for comparison .",
    "as expected , the solution of @xmath91 with its deviation lies inside the area lined out by the two deterministic solutions .",
    "albeit the rigorous fluctuation in the intimidate temperature range , a distinct phase transitions can be figured out with the orientation preference of spins differentiated from @xmath94 , i.e. the spontaneous magnetization of simple ising model .",
    "figure [ fig3]b shows the detailed solution of @xmath91 around the critical temperature @xmath6 . although the error bar is considerable large merely below @xmath6 , the transition is still distinctive . besides the averaged solution over 11,000 results , we have also investigated several single runs and found that the position of @xmath6 is consistent , i.e. the phase transition of ising spins is independent of the structural stochasticity .",
    "this phenomenon evidenced a well - defined thermodynamics of the randomly multi - branched lattice , and we can be confidential to apply the conventional analysis onto this inhomogeneous lattice .",
    "ten sets of free energies with @xmath0 varying from 2 to 3 by the increment of 0.1 are shown in fig.[fig4]a .",
    "similar to the solutions , free energies of cross - dimensional structures lies inside the area outlined by the 2 and 3-branched free energy curves .",
    "the uneven curves of the free energies of models with @xmath95 imply the thermal fluctuations , which agree with the significant error bar of the solutions presented in fig.[fig3 ] .    to more clearly investigate the thermal fluctuation ,",
    "the entropies derived from @xmath96 of five structures are presented in fig.[fig4]b .",
    "rigorous fluctuations can be observed on the entropy behaviors of stochastic models , with a superheating extrapolation unphysically surpass the entropy of the amorphous state .",
    "these singularities should not be understood as the simple effect of randomness , it actually reveals the inhomogeneity in the cross - dimensional range : for the near surface region of a bulk materials , the layer beneath the surface is at the halfway up the energy landscape , and its state is fragile and easily to be frustrated by the energy flow from surface to bulk or vice versa . at the critical range ,",
    "the system is in dramatic dynamics , as the surface begins the order - disorder phase transition while the bulk remains ordered , therefore the energy fluctuations is expected to induce locally superheating in between .",
    "one of the most important aim to design and investigate the inhomogeneous husimi lattice , is its application in the cross - dimensional range .",
    "figure [ fig5]a presents the ten sets of solutions with various analog @xmath73 , and the 3d mapping of these solutions is presented in fig.[fig5]b .",
    "this 3d mapping clearly indicates the gradient in the cross dimensional situation , i.e. the depth from surface to the bulk , or the expansion of a thin film to thick bulk .",
    "herein we can observe from the 3d mapping that it is possible to have different phases on the near - surface region at the same temperature . the edge of the 0.5 plateau is the transition line , which is fitted as @xmath97 with @xmath98 ( fig.[fig5]c ) .    before analyzing the exponential behavior of @xmath99 vs. @xmath73 presented in eq.[tranline ] , the variation of ground state energy with the analog @xmath73 should be figured out as a reference .",
    "when the systems is at @xmath100 , all the spins point to one direction as a perfect crystal and we have the ground state energy @xmath101 with entropy @xmath102 . for the homogeneous lattices of @xmath103 and @xmath104 ,",
    "the ground energy state is simply the number of coupling interactions @xmath105 , or @xmath106 ( one interaction is shared by two spins ) . for the cross - dimensional lattices in between , the ground state energies @xmath107 with various analog @xmath73 exhibit linear behavior as presented in table[t1 ] ,",
    "this phenomenon evidenced that the system has a well - defined average property according to the probability ratio .",
    "therefore , the exponential correlation of @xmath99 vs. analog @xmath73 suggests that the stochasticity might be the single reason to affect the transition behavior near the critical temperature , and we may hypothesize that structural randomness reduces the stability of the system and leads to a lower transition temperature .",
    "nevertheless , in the quantitative aspect , the exponential fitting and the meaning of the parameters in eq.[tranline ] is still unclear .",
    "further investigations on this phenomenon is in progress .",

    "the ferromagnetic ising model was solved on a randomly multi - branched husimi square lattice .",
    "the lattice was constructed with two or three squares connecting on one with the probability @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "while the system is deterministic on each end , the structures with variable @xmath3 in between describes a cross - dimensional situation from 2d to 3d , such as the thin film or the near - surface case .",
