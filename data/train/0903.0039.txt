    "self - sustained oscillators ( sso ) [ 1 ] are abundant in the world : organ and violin , sea waves , many biological processes , car engines , clocks and watches , van - der - pol oscillator , maser and laser , el ni@xmath6o and la ni@xmath6a cycles , the luminosity oscillations of many stars , and perhaps even the universe itself , to name just a few . while the energy supply ( pumping ) can be provided by all kinds of sources , the common facilitator of all sso is a so called positive feedback , which overcomes damping by properly controlling the system during an oscillation cycle .",
    "a zero steady - state then becomes unstable , and the oscillations grow until they reach a stable limit cycle with a well defined amplitude and frequency of coherent oscillation .",
    "many sso also exhibit hysteretic excitation ( bistability ) and related multi - limit cycles due to nonlinearity .",
    "it is of great interest to explore sso in its most fundamental setting by using single particles .",
    "amazingly , the effect based on the same basic principle of blue - shifted light pressure that provides both the pumping and positive feedback , can be observed using all kind of particles , from single atom to a macro - object , e. g. submillimeter dielectric sphere , as long as the right conditions , in particular good optical resonance , are satisfied .",
    "the `` one - atom '' maser [ 2 ] and laser [ 3 ] generate optical photons with quantum - mechanical statistics [ 4 ] , whereas a single particle @xmath7 sso allows for highly excited _ classical _ motion and interesting applications .",
    "while trapped / cooled ions , atoms [ 5 - 20 ] and molecules [ 21 ] have became fascinating objects of research on their quantum properties and applications [ 5 - 10 ] , their `` classical '' dynamics remains somewhat less explored . in this letter",
    ", we propose to use a trapped atom , ion , molecule , or macro - particle to excite a _",
    "motional _ sso powered by doppler - affected radiation pressure of light blue - detuned from an atomic absorption line .",
    "this light activated self - sustained oscillator ( lasso ) is a controllable and stable system with large amplitude excitation and all the major sso features ; for certain conditions it is almost thresholdless .",
    "a lasso could be used as a rotation sensor based on the `` foucault pendulum '' in a trap , single atom spectroscopy , mass - spectroscopy , isotope separation , etc .",
    "the idea of using near - resonant @xmath8 light to impose strong damping on the motion of atoms and ions via doppler - affected radiation pressure [ 16 - 20 ] provided a powerful tool for laser cooling [ 5 - 15 ] . on the other hand",
    ", it became obvious long ago [ 22 ] that a _ blue - detuned _ laser would facilitate a doppler instability and the positive feedback needed for sso .",
    "for a particle in a trap , the required laser intensities are extremely low and allow for _ cw _ operation of a lasso , providing for interesting applications .",
    "blue - detuned radiation was proposed also for use in atom waveguides and concave traps [ 23 ] .",
    "let us consider the simplest model of a classical particle motion in a _",
    "1-d _ harmonic potential in the @xmath9-axis with a frequency @xmath10 under the action of em - waves counterpropagating in the same @xmath9-axis , whereby it is governed by the equation : @xmath11 { / } m ; \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the `` dot '' designates @xmath12 , @xmath9 is the atom location , @xmath13 is a damping force due to losses in a trap , @xmath2 is a light - pressure force , and @xmath14 is a particle mass .",
    "a common damping factor is a drag force due to residual rarefied gas ( see e. g. [ 24 ] ) . in the approximation of the so called _ free molecule flow",
    "_ it can be roughly estimated by simply computing the collisions of a moving micro- or macro - particle with a low - temperature molecules of the gas : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xmath17 is the mean free path , @xmath18 , scaled by a mass - factor due to energy / momentum transfer to a gas molecule of mass @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the gas number density , and @xmath21 is the cross - section of a collision between a particle and a gas molecule of respective diameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , assuming that they both are ideal spheres . in a static ( ion ) trap , on the other hand , an another factor is the energy decay of a charged particle via lossy trap circuits [ 10 ] ; in this case @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a relevant relaxation time .",
    "the radiation force @xmath2 is caused by laser beams with their frequency @xmath26 in the laboratory frame being blue - detuned from an atomic frequency @xmath27 . since in most of configurations of interest , the pumping beams can be assumed weakly focused and regarded as plane waves , the scattering force due to photon absorption [ 5 - 9,16 - 20 ] ( to be followed by spontaneous emission ) is dominant over the gradient ( or dipole , or stimulated emission ) force [ 5 - 9,11 - 15,23 ] , which is due to spatial inhomogeneity of each wave [ 25 ] .",
    "we consider here only the spontaneous component of @xmath2 ; while simplifying the basic theory of lasso , this assumption is not critical . assigning the subscript `` + '' to a wave propagating in the positive @xmath9 direction , and `` - '' to the opposite direction",
    ", one has @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the rate of photon absorption by the atom from the respective waves . in the case of large detuning ( see below ) , for most part of a motional cycle , the absorption / radiation is a virtual transition to be regarded an instantaneous elastic scattering , leaving the excited level depopulated .",
    "we also assume through the paper that in the case of single atoms and ions , the trap temperature is kept significantly low , which is a common situation in most of the trap experiments with micro - particles . in application to a two - level model in the case of micro - particles",
    ", we also make a realistic assumption that the trapping potential is the same for both the ground state and the excited state , i.  e. that the resonance frequency is the same at any point of the trap .",
    "the atom energy losses in vacuum ( and hence the required laser pumping to overcome it ) are low , and all the major effects emerge at intensities many orders of magnitude lower than the saturation intensity ; and typically ( and preferably ) the trap frequency @xmath10 is much lower than the atomic absorption linewidth , @xmath32 ( the `` weak binding '' limit ) .",
    "thus , one can use a no - saturation and `` polarization - follows - the - driving '' approximation , especially for large detunings @xmath33 , when @xmath34 , which is the case of most interest ; its results coincide with those of a classical lorentz absorption model .",
    "the instantaneous ( on the motional scale ) radiation forces are then : @xmath35}^{-1 } \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are instantaneous doppler shifts of atomic frequency with regard to the `` @xmath37 '' waves respectively ( note that for large oscillations , the peak shifts , occurring near the center of oscillations , @xmath38 , are large , @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the rabi frequency and the amplitude of each wave , and @xmath42 is an atomic dipole moment . for small oscillations , the force @xmath2 can be written as @xmath43 if @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 , which makes @xmath2 an anti - damping force .",
    "it is easily understood from the photon absorption viewpoint : as opposite to the atom cooling by red - shifted photons , when the blue - shifted photon is absorbed by an atom at its resonant frequency , the excess energy of the absorbed photon would go into kinetic energy of the atom and heat it up . if @xmath46 overcomes the damping @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the oscillations build up resulting in sso , which is essentially a classical `` squeezed '' process with well determined , low - fluctuation amplitude and uncertain phase .",
    "the nonlinearity of @xmath2 _ vs _ @xmath48 at some point arrests this growth , and a limit cycle ( a steady - state mode of sso ) is established .",
    "the motion of a particle attaining up to @xmath49 energy typical for a static trap for ions , corresponds to @xmath50 temperature .",
    "however , although the process in consideration can be viewed as something opposite to cooling , it should not be confused with simply heating the particle : if the pumping is well above threshold , its energy is transformed into a highly ordered , coherent sso motion , which differs from a thermal heating the same way as the sound of violin differs from a street noise , or laser radiation  from that of a black - body radiation .",
    "using envelope approximation [ 1 ] ( applicable since @xmath51 ) , i. e. @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are slowly varying amplitude and phase of the oscillations respectively , one arrives at the equation for the dynamics of the peak velocity , @xmath55 , alone : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gain due to the radiation force averaged over the oscillation cycle , and @xmath58 ; all the term in @xmath59 of eq .",

    "the threshold pumping , @xmath94 , required to excite the lasso in a `` soft '' way , i. e. from zero , @xmath95 , is due only to @xmath96 : @xmath97 it is the lowest , @xmath98 , at @xmath99 @xmath100 , and corresponds to the field intensity @xmath101 @xmath102 , so that the lasso is virtually @xmath103 ( but may not be so for large detunings ) . the rest of the lasso characteristics depend on the ratio @xmath104 . in our example",

    "in general , parameter @xmath114 may vary widely ( e. g. for neutral particle trapping , @xmath115 , under proper conditions , see below ) , which affects the dependence of the lasso amplitude on the pumping intensity . however , the common and most remarkable feature emerging here for any @xmath114 , is large hysteresises when the detuning and pumping are sufficiently large .",
    "the hysteresis - free domain is larger for the case of dominant collisional losses , @xmath115 , since those losses are negligibly low at small amplitudes ; in this case the hysteresis - free lasso excitation exists for @xmath116 , for any @xmath117 , and for @xmath118 , for @xmath119 . if @xmath109 , i. e. dominant trapping losses , a similar domain is @xmath120 for any @xmath117 . at the onset of hysteresis @xmath121 if @xmath115 , whereas @xmath122 if @xmath109 ( as in the above example ) . within a lasso hysteresis loop , there are two to three non - zero steady - states , depending on @xmath114 .",
    "examination of particle dynamics using eq .",
    "( 4 ) shows that the limit cycle with the largest @xmath65 is always stable .",
    "the same is true for the lowest @xmath65 in the case of three non - zero @xmath65 s ( emerging at @xmath115 ) , whereas the intermediate limit cycle is unstable . with two non - zero @xmath65 s ( emerging at @xmath109 )",
    ", the limit cycle with lower @xmath65 is unstable .",
    "the zero - point steady - state , @xmath73 , is always stable at @xmath123 , and unstable otherwise .",
    "the solution for the lowest branch , @xmath124 , away from the immediate vicinity of a hysteresis jump , is @xmath125 on the upper branch , @xmath126 , in the limit @xmath127 , one has @xmath128 , while in the limit @xmath129 , @xmath130 @xmath131 .",

    ". the higher the magnitude of @xmath63 and @xmath132 , the larger is the loop .",
    "evaluating the `` contrast of hysteresis '' as the ratio @xmath133 of the `` up - jump '' intensity , @xmath134 , to the `` down - jump '' intensity , @xmath135 , and making use of eq .",
    "( 7 ) for @xmath136 , we estimate that at the down - jump @xmath137 regardless of @xmath114 .",
    "thus , if @xmath109 , @xmath138 , while if @xmath115 , @xmath139 .",
    "the intensity at which the up - jump occurs is @xmath140 if @xmath109 . in the limit @xmath115 , one obtains @xmath141 at the onset of the up - jump . hence @xmath142 .",
    "thus , in both limits , @xmath143 here @xmath144 if @xmath109 , and @xmath145 , if @xmath115 .",
    "typically , if @xmath146 , the contrast @xmath133 is large .    to explain the lasso hysteresis",
    ", we note that the larger the detuning , the lower is the dispersion , hence the smaller doppler _ positive feedback _ for _ small _ oscillations .",
    "however , sufficiently _",
    "large _ oscillations at the _ same _ pumping can be self - sustained , provided their peak doppler shift @xmath65 brings the atom closer to an _ exact _ resonance where the dispersion is the strongest , i. e. @xmath147 or @xmath148 , see eq .",
    "thus , once large oscillations are excited , they can be supported even by a _",
    "lower _ pumping intensity .",
    "if @xmath149 , a peak positive feedback occurs at the instance when the doppler effect eq .",
    "( 2 ) in _ one of the waves _ compensates the detuning , @xmath150 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the game of tennis : it can be sustained only if the ball speed is high enough .",
    "( note here that the lasso hysteresis differs from that in cyclotron excitation of a single electron [ 30 - 32 ] , since in the latter case one is dealing with @xmath151 and not sso motion . )",
    "both the pumping detuning @xmath63 and intensity @xmath132 are easily controlled . even at the extremes , the lasso operates far below the saturation of the atomic absorption .",
    "the weak binding , @xmath152 is most favorable for lasso operation .",
    "( a strong binding will be considered by us elsewhere . ) typically , the sso amplitude is much larger than the laser wavelength ; thus the standing wave pattern [ 24 ] in @xmath2 was justifiably neglected .",
    "it is also worth noting that while standing wave wave was used here for simplicity sake , actually the same lasso effect can attained by using only one traveling wave [ 25 ] ; the main difference is that in _ cw _ mode in this case the center of particle motion would not coincide with the lowest point of trap potential .    for large lasso oscillations , the harmonicity of the trap potential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) would not hold , thus affecting the lasso frequency . if the anharmonicity is symmetric , the term @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) could be replaced by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the half - size of the trap ; signs `` - '' and `` + '' correspond to `` soft '' and `` hard '' potentials , respectively , and the lasso frequency is @xmath156 , provided @xmath157 .",
    "a motional quantum excitation number , @xmath158 , for typical conditions is @xmath159 ; thus , the system may be regarded as strongly classical at low frequencies . however , at the `` optical end '' , under certain conditions it may become strongly quantum , since the absorption of photons by the atom , and resulting spontaneous emission of photons in all possible direction may result in the spontaneous deflection of atom from a classically - prescribed trajectory , which may be regarded as a broad - band noise induced by optical pumping . near the threshold of oscillations , this noise will result in the broadening of the spectral line of oscillations , similar to any other self - sustained oscillator , such as e.  g. shot noise in electronic sso , or spontaneous radiation in laser near the threshold of its excitation .",
    "however , similarly to those system , one should expect that as the pumping significantly exceeds that threshold , @xmath160 , the spontaneous noise becomes insignificant , and the oscillations will be strongly coherent and their linewidth  drastically reduced .    an elliptic or circular lasso orbit in a _ 2-d _ lasso can be attained by using two pairs of counterpropagating laser beams , with their axes normal to each other ; circular motion will require the same pairs intensities .",
    "one of the differences of such a `` lassotron '' resonance from a magnetic cyclotron resonance and its hysteresises [ 26 - 28 ] is that the particle does not have only one direction of revolution prescribed by a _",
    "dc _ magnetic field and its charge , but may instead , depending on initial conditions , revolve now in any direction in the plane of the beams .",
    "the experimental conditions for lasso observation can be arranged based on the existing traps . in fact , the heating observed in [ 29,30 ] may indicate a @xmath161 sso excited during that part of the cycle of the @xmath151 @xmath162 side - band motional oscillations in the paul trap , when due to _ driven _ doppler shift , an ion sees the laser ( on average red - detuned ) as blue - detuned . however , the related micromotion is far from a well defined steady - state lasso regime .",
    "the strong binding arrangement in [ 29,30 ] should produce a much more complicated picture of motion than lasso .",
    "the hysteresis in the motion of a trapped single ion has been observed experimentally in [ 31 ] and numerically in [ 32 ] .",
    "the major nonlinearity in [ 31,32 ] comes however from @xmath163 excitation of a _ three - level _ ion ( e. g. @xmath164 ) pumped by _ two _ lasers with their frequencies near - resonant to different atomic transitions .",
    "the lasso , on the other hand , involves the simplest , two - level atom model with a single - photon resonance , and is based only on the doppler effect and not the _ atomic _ nonlinearity .",
    "the lasso produces huge oscillations that take the system far beyond the lamb - dicke limit , @xmath165 , common in trapping / cooling physics , as well as huge hysteresises with a contrast of few orders of magnitude .",
    "the issue of the most appropriate static ( ion ) trap for the lasso experiment has to be considered separately , with recent developments in the field offering a wide range of possible traps [ 37 ] .",
    "the simplest way to observe lasso could be to use the penning trap , with the particle self - sustained oscillation exited along the axis of symmetry of the trap , i. e. between the trap caps and normally to the ring electrode .",
    "the main condition then is that the cyclotron frequency of a particle in a strong _ dc _ magnetic field be much greater than the vibrational lasso frequency @xmath10 , but this is typical for penning traps [ 10,37 ] .",
    "this arrangement can be used for mass - spectroscopy and isotope separation ; however it can not support foucault oscillator , since the lasso motion here has strongly preferred oscillation axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the paul trap makes it feasible for a particle to choose its main direction of oscillations in a plane normal to the trap axis , and thus it could be appropriate for realization of _ 2-d _ foucault lasso oscillator , although a _ 1-d _ model implied by eq .",
    "( 1 ) will be a rough approximation to the full motion .    while a single - atom experiment is of fundamental significance , for a proof - of - principle experiment",
    "a charged macro - particle in the penning of paul trap is perhaps a better , and much more attainable and controlled candidate .",
    "( notice , e.  g. the use of an aluminum dust to demonstrate trapping in many experiments [ 37 ] . ) a cluster of e. g. alkali or rare - gas atoms , a dielectric or metallic charged sphere , or even a charged oil droplet , similar to the ones used by millikan in his experiments on the measurement of an electron charge , may become an easy setup with a simple static trap for a charged particle and a low - power laser . in this case , for the pumping exceeding the threshold by a few times , the entire situation is purely classical .",
    "while static traps allow for ion trapping [ 5 - 9,10,37 ] only , a neutral atom can be trapped optically by gradient ( dipole ) forces [ 11 ] .",
    "it is attracted to the high - intensity areas if @xmath166 , and the low - intensity areas if @xmath44 . an all - optical lasso is attained by gradient - trapping an atom @xmath82 , with @xmath167 on the @xmath168 d - line , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , in the focal area of a single red - detuned laser [ 12 ] , while lasso - pumping ( using scattering forces ) is attained by an a weakly focused blue - detuned laser .",
    "the trapping laser here induces also a doppler spontaneous damping . to use a blue - detuned laser only",
    ", one can arrange two collinear counterpropagating beams having their foci set apart [ 13 ] and a `` doughnut '' [ 33,34 ] profile with non - zero intensity on the axis .",
    "the only damping here is due to collisions , and lasso here is completely thresholdless .    in a future research",
    ", it may also be worth considering the case of an atom submitted to both a blue and a red - detuned laser , so as to have at the same time damping by doppler cooling and a lasso effect . by using different detunings , powers , and transitions ( different linewidth )",
    ", it might be possible to find a regime where the velocity - dependence of the damping and the lasso forces are different enough so as to generate stable oscillations .",
    "the lasso has an interesting potential as a rotation sensor based on a `` foucault pendulum '' ( fp ) effect : a lasso - excited ( and then left alone ) particle conserves its oscillation direction in space .",
    "along with a gyroscope and an em sagnac effects , the foucault pendulum [ 35 ] is one of very few effects / devices , which unequivocally demonstrate that the universe affects our `` regular '' mechanics and electrodynamics .",
    "however , unlike the other two effects , the foucault pendulum needs a cathedral - size structure for its realization , which severely limits its applications for e. g. rotation detection and inertial navigation ; besides , it relies on the gravitation , which imposes even stronger limits on these applications .",
    "the need in very long pendulum string comes out of the requirement for a sufficiently long relaxation time .",
    "lowering the frequency of the pendulum makes this time longer even for the same finesse of the system ; furthermore , the damping per cycle is lower for higher ratio of the string length to its diameter ; hence the long pendulum .",
    "the gravitation / acceleration environment simply makes the pendulum possible ( for example , the foucault pendulum  or any pendulum  would be impossible in the space ) .",
    "both these drawbacks of the foucault pendulum can be overcame by using a single particle trapped in a symmetrical _ 3-d _ or _",
    "2-d _ trap in a vacuum .",
    "this would allow one to have a small - size motional oscillator with very low damping ( which can further be completely eliminated by a low - intrusive positive feedback provided by a few laser beams , see below ) , whose oscillation and momentum - conservation properties will be `` portable '' in the sense that they be provided by the trap potential , and not by the local gravity .",
    "all this may put the lasso used as a `` foucault trap oscillator '' into the realm of inertial navigation applications similar to those of mechanical and laser ( i. e. sagnac - based ) gyroscopes .    for the fp observation in the _",
    "2-d _ configuration , one can use two degenerate degrees of freedom found in some of existing trap , to make a `` foucault plane '' .",
    "small imperfections , @xmath171 , in the _",
    "2-d _ symmetry of that potential can be made negligible by proper design and machining , as well as by choosing a heavy particle and a large lasso amplitude , similarly to a regular fp . to this end ,",
    "macro - particles offer the best possibility . similarly to [ 11 ] , to optically exert a light - pressure on a macro - particle , one may use very narrow mie - debay resonances [ 36 ] of dielectric sphere , which are due to the coupling of the laser to the high - finesse whispering gallery modes .",
    "the critical ( lowest ) rotational rate picked up by the fp , is @xmath172 . if @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , one has @xmath176 of the earth rotation rate , which is sufficient for inertial navigation .",
    "a slowly dissipating particle energy can repeatedly be replenished by a laser aligned to the new direction of oscillations in the lab frame . as was noted above , in principle",
    ", the random character of the exciting force ( spontaneous photons emitted in all directions ) may cause momentum diffusion , including in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation .",
    "however this might be a problem only in the case of micro - particle , and only near the threshold of the lasso - oscillations ; with increased pumping , the ratio fluctuation / amplitude will go down . and this factor can be completely ignored in the case of macro - particle , as in the above example .",
    "no regular classical foucault pendulum even in non - rarefied air has ever been known for quantum - induced momentum diffusion .",
    "the lasso can be used for single particle spectroscopy by studying lasso amplitude _ vs _ laser frequency .",
    "another related application is isotope separation , whereby a laser tuned in between atomic lines of two isotopes , cools down the isotope with higher atomic frequency and lasso - excites the other isotope , pushing it out if the pumping is sufficient .",
    "this approach can be modified and enhanced by using hysteresis and the fact that the up - jump intensity of the hysteresis is very sensitive to the detuning . with a laser blue - detuned from _ both _ the atomic frequencies",
    ", one can attain large lasso - excitation of one of the species while keeping the other one at rest .",
    "gradient force isotope separation by a focused gaussian laser beam [ 14 ] could also be greatly enhanced by doppler damping ( instability ) , which is a significant factor in pulling in ( pushing out ) higher ( lower ) atomic frequency species .",
    "in conclusion , weak _ cw _ laser radiation can induce a doppler instability and large self - sustained motional oscillations of a trapped single particle via the radiation pressure of light blue - detuned from an absorption resonance .",
    "the oscillations exhibit huge hysteresis and may easily reach a trap - size orbit .",
    "the effect can potentially be used for rotation sensing , inertial navigation , single - atom spectroscopy , mass - spectroscopy , and isotope separation ."
