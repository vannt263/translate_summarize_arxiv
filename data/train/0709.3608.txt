    "efforts to design scalable quantum computers ( qcs ) @xcite and other new quantum technologies @xcite are rekindling interest in the phenomenology of open quantum system dynamics .",
    "while effects of atom - radiation field interactions @xcite have been extensively studied , the consequences of interaction with a complex environment are just beginning to be explored .",
    "solid and condensed phase environments bequeath a diversity of controllable interactions for scalable implementation of new quantum technologies , and thus understanding the open system dynamics induced by such complex environments is of particular interest .",
    "recent studies have reported a number of interesting effects such as suppression of decoherence with increasing bath chaos @xcite and large coherent shifting @xcite .",
    "manifestation of chaos @xcite , or at least non - integrability , is a defining and unavoidable feature of complex environments .",
    "evidence suggests that condensed phase dynamics is generally chaotic : dynamics of a colloidal particle in water @xcite , and both vibrational dynamics @xcite of si and its electronic structure @xcite have been shown to be chaotic .",
    "anharmonic corrections are known to be important in the study of phonons and essential for an understanding of heat transport @xcite .",
    "thus , the chaotic bath model provides a better representation for the condensed or solid state environment than standard uncoupled oscillator bath models .",
    "chaotic bath models are substantially more difficult to simulate than the radiation field . at high temperatures random matrix theories @xcite , or classical trajectory simulations such as the wigner method @xcite , can be used .",
    "redfield theory @xcite and its generalizations @xcite can also be employed .",
    "but at the very low temperatures relevant to quantum computing technologies the options are more limited .",
    "there is a recently developed approximate master equation @xcite which appears to be accurate in this low temperature regime .",
    "however , as with any approximate theory its predictions need to be otherwise confirmed .    in this manuscript",
    "we derive a simple formula for the reduced density which captures all the important features of open system dynamics induced by chaotic environments in the low temperature regime .",
    "the equation is of the kraus operator sum representation ( osr ) @xcite form which automatically satisfies all the required conservation laws for the reduced density , i.e. hermiticity , complete positivity and norm conservation .",
    "our kraus osr@xcite provides a formally exact equation for the reduced density in terms of explicit representations of the kraus operators . aside from chaos ,",
    "the only required property of the bath hamiltonian is that it be of large thermodynamic dimension .    as a first test",
    ", we compare the predictions of the chaotic kraus osr@xcite to exact calculations for a model of a single qubit interacting with an isolated qc with static internal flaws . while our derivation assumes a bath of thermodynamic dimensions , our numerical test shows that very accurate results can be obtained even for a chaotic bath of just ten qubits .",
    "organization of this manuscript is as follows .",
    "a derivation of the kraus osr@xcite , in three steps , is given in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss our chaotic spin - bath model .",
    "in section 4 we test the osr against exact numerical results . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "consider the following total hamiltonian for the bipartite closed system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath3 is the bath hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath4 is the interaction hamiltonian where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the system and bath coupling operators , respectively .",
    "our derivation consists of three parts .",
    "first we review the construction of the osr assuming a complete bath eigenbasis ( i.e @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "next we show that the off - diagonal ( @xmath9 ) matrix elements of bath coupling operator @xmath10 vanish for a chaotic bath in the thermodynamic limit . finally , we use this fact to show that the resulting kraus osr takes a particularly simple and potentially useful form .",
    "we consider an uncorrelated initial state for the whole system @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an arbitrary initial state of the system and @xmath13 is an initial bath state of canonical form , i.e. @xmath14 the subsequent states will be given by the exact solutions @xmath15 of the liouville - von neumann equation @xmath16.\\ ] ] here @xmath17 .",
    "the exact reduced density of the system is then formally obtained by tracing over the bath degrees of freedom , i.e , @xmath18 since the bath eigenbasis is complete , and the initial canonical bath density is already diagonal in eigenstates of @xmath3 , performing the partial trace in the same basis yields @xmath19 which in turn can be written in more compact kraus osr form @xmath20 where the kraus operators are defined by @xmath21 here @xmath22 are the initial populations of the bath eigenstates .",
    "note that @xmath23 .",
    "this form of the kraus osr is of formal interest only .",
    "although it is exact and so satisfies all the required conservation laws ( i.e. the hermiticity , complete positivity , and norm ) for the subsystem density it is not practical for computational purposes .",
    "first , the explicit forms of the kraus operators ( [ kraus ] ) are not known in general , because the kraus osr ( [ kraus ] ) is not unique . and",
    "secondly , the double sum in ( [ osr ] ) would make use of the osr impractical even if simple forms for ( [ kraus ] ) were known .",
    "we will now show that in the limit of a chaotic bath of thermodynamic dimension , explicit forms for ( [ kraus ] ) can be supplied and that the double sum reduces to a unique single sum .      using the bath eigenvalues and eigenstates , the total hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "can alternatively be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the bath coupling operator matrix elements defined above in eq .",
    "( [ bjk ] ) , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are again the bath eigenenergies and eigenstates .",
    "decoherence and open system dynamical effects are mediated by the matrix elements @xmath25 and by operators @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "we will focus on the properties of @xmath25 .",
    "now we assume that @xmath3 is chaotic ( both quantally and classically ) and that the wigner function@xcite of @xmath6 has a classical limit .",
    "coordinate and momentum bath coupling operators , for example , have wigner functions with classical limits .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the number of bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we will eventually send @xmath30 to attain the thermodynamic limit .",
    "quantum chaos has a number of important consequences for matrix elements and spectra@xcite .",
    "we will now show that off - diagonal matrix elements vanish for thermodynamic baths .",
    "we begin with an exact formula for the off - diagonal matrix elements of an arbitrary quantum system : @xmath31 this is obtained by combining the exact equations ( 50 ) and ( 119 ) of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the wigner function@xcite of operator @xmath6 and @xmath33 is a scaled wigner function for eigenstate @xmath34 .",
    "it is well known@xcite that @xmath35 has a well defined classical limit if the classical hamiltonian @xmath36 is chaotic .",
    "[ the wigner function of @xmath37 may differ from the classical hamiltonian by small corrections which vanish with planck s constant , but we ignore this distinction in our discussion . ]",
    "we employ a notation where @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are the momenta and @xmath40 the coordinates .",
    "@xmath41 is the @xmath42 dimensional symplectic matrix . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 has the dimensions of action .",
    "now , note that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the microcanonical entropy and @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "now since entropy is extensive , @xmath46 scales linearly with @xmath29 for sufficiently large @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , by lhpital s rule , it follows that @xmath48 scales exponentially with @xmath29 .",
    "finally , it follows that @xmath49 is constant , or at most grows weakly with @xmath29 since the energies @xmath26 also grow with @xmath29 .",
    "the wigner functions @xmath35 and @xmath32 and the associated integrals in ( [ bij2 ] ) have well defined classical@xcite and therefore thermodynamic limits . in the classical limit ,",
    "for example , these terms reduce to @xmath50 which increases slowly with @xmath29 .",
    "( here @xmath51 is the classical canonical average of the squared classical limit of the wigner function for @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath52 and so @xmath51 would normally scale linearly with @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath53 is only weakly dependent on @xmath29 .",
    "note also that @xmath54 should be understood as a distribution with a small but nonzero width . )",
    "thus , by lhpital s rule , the magnitude of @xmath55 in the thermodynamic limit is determined by the factor @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath57 , which will always be true for sufficiently large @xmath29 , then @xmath58 exponentially fast as @xmath59 . note that the requirement is @xmath57 , not the stronger semiclassical @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath6 vanish for a chaotic bath of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "they also decay exponentially fast with increasing @xmath29 , and so they may be neglected even for quite small baths .    in the semi - classical limit , the scaling , @xmath61 has long been known in the quantum chaos literature@xcite , but its consequences in the thermodynamic limit , and for the kraus osr in particular , have not been appreciated .",
    "as we have shown , the semi - classical limit @xmath62 is not a necessary condition for the vanishing of the off - diagonals , @xmath63 , for a chaotic bath of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "it is also worth noting that similar formulas arise in other contexts from completely different arguments@xcite .",
    "now , we will show that the vanishing of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the bath coupling operator has important consequences for the kraus osr ( i.e. eq .",
    "( [ osr ] ) ) . to begin with , hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] )",
    "reduces the simpler form @xmath64 for integer powers of @xmath65 then , it is true that @xmath66 for all @xmath34 and @xmath67 . using eq .",
    "( [ ham4 ] ) for @xmath68 one can readily show that the kraus operators ( [ kraus ] ) take the explicit form @xmath69 finally , substituting this back into ( [ osr ] ) gives the desired form of the chaotic kraus decomposition @xmath70    equation ( [ ctk ] ) is an exact equation for the reduced density of an arbitrary quantum system interacting with a chaotic bath of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "while the arguments of the previous section were cast in terms of a phase space representation , similar arguments could be devised for spin baths using generalized coherent state representations@xcite . in the next section",
    "we actually employ a spin bath to test the formula ( [ ctk ] ) numerically .",
    "we will show that ( [ ctk ] ) is very accurate even for a bath of just ten qubits .",
    "in our recent investigation @xcite we showed that internal decoherence , dissipation and coherent shifting , caused by static one and two - body internal imperfections , are potential error sources for flawed qcs@xcite .",
    "we also showed that a single detector qubit can be configured to probe internal bath dynamics @xcite and thus one can obtain valuable information about the bath self - interactions . here",
    "we extend our previous exact numerical results to a longer time limit and test the chaotic kraus decomposition against these exact results . in what follows",
    "we briefly review our flawed qc model and our exact numerical approach .",
    "details of this study are given in @xcite .",
    "our chaotic spin - bath model represents a flawed qc core@xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath71 where the first term represents a central qubit ( i.e. the detector qubit ) .",
    "the second term is the system - bath coupling operator , and the last two terms constitute the chaotic bath hamiltonian which represents the rest of the flawed qc .",
    "our numerical simulations are based on the experimentally relevant parameter regime for a josephson charge - qubit qc proposal @xcite .",
    "we set the detector qubit energy to @xmath72 in units of @xmath73 mk . we assume that all other qubits other than the detector qubit have one - body flaws , i.e. @xmath74 $ ] and similarly @xmath75 $ ] where the detuning is set to @xmath76 .",
    "two - body flaws , i.e. residual system - bath couplings , and chaos generating intra - bath interactions are modeled via @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we kept the bath temperature constant at @xmath79 in all our simulations . keeping the value of the system - bath coupling constant at @xmath80 we considered three different values of intra - bath couplings ; @xmath81 in units of @xmath82 .",
    "by @xmath83 the bath is fully chaotic .    exploiting the experimentally relevant low temperature regime @xcite for the charge - qubit qc proposal @xcite we calculated the exact reduced density @xmath84 via the formula @xmath85 , \\label{tden2}\\ ] ] where the populations of bath are defined by @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the solutions to the schrdinger equation for all initial states @xmath88 .",
    "the initial system state was chosen as a superposition state @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 bath eigenstates sufficed for all our calculations at the given low temperature .",
    "we performed numerical integrations by an eighth order variable stepsize runge - kutta method@xcite and exact diagonalization of the bath hamiltonian is achieved by a lanczos algorithm@xcite for @xmath91 bath qubits .",

    "the onset of chaos is indicated by the functional form of @xmath99 changing from the poisson form @xmath106 characteristic of integrable systems to the wigner ",
    "dyson form @xmath107 associated with chaos .",

    "dyson distribution .        while this level spacing statistic is considered to be a universal indicator of quantum chaos",
    ", it does not provide information on the degree of chaoticity .",
    "we wish to know how the accuracy of the kraus decomposition changes with increasing degree of chaos .",
    "therefore , we alternatively refer to the loschmidt echo @xmath109@xcite , which is also widely believed to be an efficient indicator of quantum chaos@xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath109 for the bath hamiltonian with the following formula @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an initial state chosen as the ground state of @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is the integrable bath hamiltonian ( i.e. @xmath37 for @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 is the chaos generating perturbation hamiltonian for @xmath116 .",

    "( [ echo ] ) .",
    "( black solid line ) , @xmath117 ( red dotted line ) , and @xmath118 ( green dashed line ) . ]    it is clear from fig . ( [ echo ] ) that increasing the magnitude of intra - bath coupling @xmath98 results in faster exponential decay of @xmath109 , which can be interpreted as increasing the degree of chaoticity .",
    "we use purity , @xmath119^{2}$ ] , to determine the extent of non - unitary evolution in the system ( i.e. decoherence and dissipation ) .",
    "the ideal value of purity is unity for pure initial system states .",
    "the fidelity is defined by @xmath120 $ ] where @xmath121 is ideal system evolution in the absence of system - bath interactions .",
    "the ideal value of fidelity is also 1 .",
    "while the purity is insensitive to the unitary effects of system - bath interactions , the fidelity is sensitive to both unitary and non - unitary effects .",
    "therefore , large deviations between the magnitudes of purity and fidelity are a good indicator of the presence of unitary shifts .",
    "we tested the accuracy of the chaotic kraus osr for several values of intra - bath couplings in the chaotic bath regime . here",
    "we compare the prediction of the chaotic kraus decomposition with exact numerical results by calculating the purity @xmath122 and fidelity @xmath123 of the reduced density .",
    "in figure ( [ pur ] ) we plot @xmath122 for three different values of intra - bath coupling @xmath98 .",
    "( time is in units of @xmath124 . )",
    "the dashed lines are the kraus predictions while the solid curve represents the exact dynamics . even for @xmath125 ,",
    "shown in part ( a ) , the decoherence predicted by the kraus decomposition is of the correct order of magnitude . clearly , however it is not quantitatively accurate .",
    "there is also a faster time scale to the exact dynamics which is not captured at all by the kraus decomposition . in part ( b ) , for @xmath126 and hence stronger chaos , we see much better agreement . in part ( c ) , for @xmath127 , the kraus decomposition is in very good agreement with the exact results .",
    "this is remarkable given that the bath contains only ten qubits .",
    "moreover , it suggests that the kraus decomposition could actually be employed as a useful computational method for low temperature systems .",
    "in figure ( [ fidel ] ) we plot @xmath128 for both exact and kraus decomposition results for the same three different values of intra - bath coupling @xmath98 .",
    "notice that the magnitude of the errors in @xmath128 is much larger than those in the purity @xmath122 .",
    "the purity measures only non - unitary errors .",
    "@xmath123 is also sensitive to unitary errors .",
    "the large deviation of @xmath122 from unity therefore indicates the presence of a large coherent shift .",
    "the origin of this shift has been explained in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the agreement between the kraus and exact results is quite good even for @xmath125 ( shown in part ( a ) ) . for @xmath126 ( part ( b ) ) and @xmath127 ( part ( c ) ) ,",
    "the agreement is excellent .    : for @xmath129 in ( a ) , @xmath117 in ( b ) , @xmath118 in ( c).,width=288,height=336 ]    : for @xmath129 in ( a ) , @xmath117 in ( b ) , @xmath118 in ( c).,width=288,height=336 ]",
    "the kraus decomposition captures the correct quantitative behavior for both unitary and non - unitary types of contributions from chaotic environmental dynamics .",
    "the accuracy of the kraus decomposition even for our small bath model is quite impressive and thus it it may prove a useful numerical simulation method . the suggestive form of the decomposition ( [ ctk ] ) is the result of primary interest .",
    "for example , it suggests that all non - unitary effects vanish when all diagonal coupling matrix elements are identical , i.e. @xmath130 . in this case",
    "the dynamics reduces to @xmath131 and the only effect of the bath is the coherent shift @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , it is also clear that the greater the variance in the coupling matrix elements , the more decoherence will be observed .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with that of an approximate master equation@xcite which has been shown to be quantitatively accurate for a number of systems@xcite .",
    "it also predicts that a chaotic bath of thermodynamic dimension with uncorrelated initial state can not cause decoherence or dissipation at absolute zero temperature .",
    "such a bath can still cause coherent shifting , however .",
    "it was previously known that strongly chaotic finite baths cause little decoherence at low temperature@xcite .",
    "the fact that no decoherence is possible at zero temperature for large chaotic baths is in strong contrast to the behavior of integrable baths . in the spin - boson model",
    "strong decoherence is possible even when the bath has zero temperature .",
    "we derived an exact and explicit kraus decomposition for systems interacting with chaotic baths of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "we showed that the decomposition is very accurate even for a small finite qubit bath , and it predicts all important features of the open system dynamics induced by chaotic environments .",
    "it could therefore prove useful as a numerical simulation method .",
