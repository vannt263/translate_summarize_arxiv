    "in recent years the theory of random geometry @xcite has become a powerful method of investigating problems in many areas of research ranging from the statistical theory of membranes @xcite , branched polymers @xcite and complex networks @xcite to fundamental questions in string theory @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "those problems have in common that they can be described by a dynamically alternating geometry which undergoes fluctuations of a statistical or quantum nature .",
    "the dynamics of such fluctuations can be modelled using the concepts of the statistical ensemble and the partition function in a similar way as it is done in particle physics by the methods of lattice field theory .",
    "contrary to lattice field theory where the partition functions run over field configurations on a rigid geometry , the geometry itself is variable here . since the geometry is dynamical many new features occur like for instance geometrical correlations or the influence of the random geometry on the fields living on it .",
    "similarly as in field theory where the concepts of universality , critical exponents , correlations , _ etc _ are independent of whether one discusses a field theoretical model of magnetism or a quantum theoretical model of particles , also in the theory of random geometry many questions are independent on details and may be addressed using general methods .",
    "general concepts can be best developed on an analytically treatable model . in field theory",
    "the role of a test bed is played by the ising model while in random geometry by the branched polymer model @xcite .    despite its simplicity",
    "the branched - polymer model has a rich phase structure exhibiting different scaling properties of the fractal geometry and the correlation functions .",
    "the model has internal and external geometry sectors similarly as the polyakov string @xcite . as the polyakov string",
    ", it can also be interpreted as a model for quantum objects embedded into a @xmath9-dimensional target space or a model of quantum gravity interacting with @xmath9-scalar fields .",
    "the term quantum gravity refers to an euclidean feynman integral expressed by a sum over diagrams representing the nearest - neighbour relations between points of a discrete set . in more realistic models",
    "the sum runs over higher dimensional simplicial manifolds and can be interpreted as a regularized feynman integral over riemannian structures on the manifold @xcite .",
    "the intuition which one can gain from the analytic solution of the branched - polymer model is very helpful for considerations of more complicated models .",
    "in fact , the model has proven already many times to be extremly useful to test and develop various ideas concerning random geometry @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to this general interest in this model there is a specific motivation which is related to the reduced super - symmetric yang - mills matrix model @xcite .",
    "this model was introduced as a non - perturbative definition for superstrings @xcite and referred to afterwards as the ikkt model .",
    "the one - loop approximation of this model leads to a model of graphs which have as a back - bone a branched - polymer with power - law weights for the link lengths .",
    "the ikkt model is believed to provide a dynamical mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry from ten to four dimensions @xcite .",
    "if one tries to understand the breaking in terms of the one - loop level approximation one finds it to be related to the fractal properties of the branched - polymers , which have the hausdorff dimension equal to four @xcite .",
    "the question of the spontanous symmetry breaking was investigated also by many other methods with help of which one was able to gain an insight into underlying physical mechanisms @xcite-@xcite .    in the simplest case one",
    "considers generic trees with the nearest - vertex interactions given by gaussian weights or weights which belong to the gaussian universality class @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also discuss the nearest - vertex interactions , but we extend the discussion to non - gaussian weights in particular to power - law weights @xcite . the energetical costs to generate long links on the polymer",
    "is then much smaller than for gaussian ones . in the extremal situation ,",
    "when the power - law exponent @xmath6 of the link length distribution @xmath12 lies in the interval @xmath13 , very long links are spontanously generated on the tree and their presence shifts the model to a new universality class which can be called the class of lvy branched polymers that similarly as lvy paths exhibit a new scaling behaviour .",
    "the scaling properties and the universality class of the model depends also on the internal branching weights of the trees @xcite . under a change of the weights the model may undergo a transition from the phase of elongated trees with the internal hausdorff dimension @xmath14 , known as generic trees , to the phase of collapsed trees with @xmath15 which are localized around a singular vertex of high - connectivity @xcite . in between",
    "there is a phase of scale - free trees which may have any hausdorff dimension between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we show that the internal properties decouple from the embedding in the target space but on the other hand that they strongly affect the embedding  : the external hausdorff dimension is proportional to the internal one @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we cover the entire classification of the universality classes of branched polymers with the nearest - vertex interactions .",
    "we hope it can be treated as a starting point in the discussion of models with more complicated interactions like for example those with correlations between neighbouring links , or self - avoidance in the embedding space .    many pieces of this classification have been discussed for the gaussian branched - polymers already @xcite .",
    "several well - known results have been summarized within the appendix in which we present a systematical treatment of the internal geometry in terms of generating functions .",
    "the extension of this classification to weights with power - law tails and to the case when the internal geometry is non - generic , is presented in the main - stream of the text .",
    "emphasis is put on calcuations of the two - point functions . throughout the paper",
    "we also stress the factorization property of the internal and external geometry , which allows us to clearly separate the discussion of the internal geometry before considering the entire model .",
    "it also permits us to reveal many interesting relations between the correlation functions of the external space to those for the internal geometry .",
    "we consider a canonical ensemble of trees embedded in a @xmath9-dimensional target space .",
    "the partition function of the ensemble is defined as a weighted sum over all labeled trees with @xmath16 vertices .",
    "the set of such labeled trees , containing @xmath17 elements , will be denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the statistical weight of a tree is given by a product of an internal weight @xmath19 which depends only on the internal geometry of the tree , and an external one which depends on the positions of the ( tree ) vertices in the target space .",
    "we shall consider trees with nearest - neighbour interactions for which the partition function reads  : @xmath20 the external weight of a tree is a product of link weights @xmath21 which depend exclusively on the link vector @xmath22 .",
    "saying alternatively , the energy cost of the embedding of the tree in the target space is a sum of energy costs of the independent embedding of links .",
    "the second product in ( [ zn ] ) runs over the set of ( unoriented ) linked vertex pairs denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the most natural choice of the internal weights is @xmath24 .",
    "we could entirely stick to this choice of weights , but since we want to discuss the problem of universality we also want to check whether a modification of the weights will change the scaling properties and hence the universality @xcite .    here",
    "we will restrict our considerations to internal weights which can be written as a product of weights @xmath25 for the individual vertices  : @xmath26 each vertex weight only depends on the degree of the vertex that means the number of links emerging from it .",
    "the internal properties of the model are determined when the whole set of branching weights @xmath27 for @xmath28 is specified .",
    "we demand that  : @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and at least one @xmath31 . if @xmath32 were zero @xmath19 would vanish for all tree graphs while",
    "if all @xmath33 for @xmath34 were zero then the weights @xmath19 would vanish for all trees except chain - structures .",
    "note that the model is invariant with respect to translations in the external space  : @xmath35 .",
    "because of the translational zero - mode the partition function ( [ zn ] ) is infinite",
    ". one can make it finite by dividing out the volume @xmath36 of the translational zero - mode  : @xmath37 this can for example be realized by fixing the position of the center of mass of the trees .",
    "trees which can be obtained from each other by a permutation of the vertex labels contribute with the same statistical weight . for a tree with @xmath16 vertices",
    "there are @xmath38 such vertex permutations . in order to avoid overcountings",
    "one introduces the standard factor @xmath39 to the definition of the partition function ( [ zn ] ) .",
    "this factor divides out the volume of the permutation group of the vertex labels .",
    "the number of all labeled trees counted with this factor @xmath40 is exponentially bounded in the @xmath41 limit . if one defines the grand - canonical partition function @xmath42 one can see that it is well defined as long as the fugacity @xmath43 is smaller than the radius of convergence of the series , which in the particular case @xmath44 is equal @xmath45 .",
    "more generally , as long as @xmath46 grows only exponentially for large @xmath16 the grand - canonical partition function has a non - vanishing radius of convergence and hence one can savely define @xmath47 .",
    "the statistical average of a quantity @xmath48 defined on the ensemble ( [ zn ] ) is given by  : @xmath49 for translationally invariant quantities the averages are proportional to the volume @xmath50 of the translational zero - mode .",
    "for such quantities one should rather speak of an average density per volume element of the target space  : @xmath51 which is a finite number .",
    "in particular @xmath52 .",
    "we will frequently distinguish between the internal and external geometry of the trees . by the former we mean the connectivity of the corresponding tree graph , by the latter its embedding in the external space .",
    "for example , the internal ( geodesic ) distance between two vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54 of a graph is defined as the number of links of the shortest path connecting them , while the external distance is given by the length of the vector @xmath55 .",
    "note that the path between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is unique for tree graphs .",
    "thus the length of this path , i.e. the number of its links , determines the internal geodesic distance .",
    "the properties of the embedding in the external space depend on the link weight function @xmath56 ( see ( [ zn ] ) ) .",
    "we consider isotropic weights depending only on the link length .",
    "that means @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath56 is a positive integrable function . without loss of generality",
    ", we can then choose the normalization to be  : @xmath59 .",
    "this allows us to interprete @xmath56 as a probability density .",
    "the fundamental quantities which encode the information about the statistical properties of the system are the correlation functions . for the canonical ensemble with the partition function ( [ zn ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath60-point correlation functions are defined as  : @xmath61 where the brackets @xmath62 on the right hand side denote the average over the ensemble ( [ an ] ) .",
    "if one multiplies all sums in the product in ( [ gnn ] ) one obtains a sum of terms being products of delta functions .",
    "the prime in equation ( [ gnn ] ) means that all terms which contain two or more identical delta functions are skipped from this sum .",
    "this exclusion principle applies only to the situation when any two arguments of @xmath63 are identical .",
    "what we will show now is that the problem of determining the @xmath60-point correlation function can be devided into two sub - problems .",
    "the first step is to determine the internal two - point function .",
    "this can in general be done independently of a particular choice of the embedding weights @xmath56 .",
    "the second is to use the information encoded in the internal two - point function to determine the external properties of the trees .    in order to see that the internal geometry of the trees does not depend on the choice of the link weight function ,",
    "consider a tree graph and calculate the following two integrals for this tree  : @xmath64 the first integral corresponds to the embedding weight factor for a tree whose @xmath65-th vertex is fixed at the position @xmath66 in the target space . since the model is translationally invariant the result of the integration does not depend on the position .",
    "this result can be obtained by changing the integration variables from position vectors of all vertices @xmath67 to link vectors @xmath68 for which the integration completely factorizes .",
    "the jacobian for such a change of the integration variables is equal one .",
    "the second integral ( [ t2 ] ) gives the weight factor for a tree whose vertices @xmath65 and @xmath69 are fixed at the positions @xmath66 and @xmath70 in the external space .",
    "the result depends only on the difference @xmath71 and the number of links , @xmath72 , of the path connecting the vertices @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "if one now changes the integration variables from vertex positions to link vectors , as before , one can see that all integrations , except those for links on the path between @xmath65 and @xmath69 , factorize .",
    "the sum of the link vectors on the path is restricted to @xmath73 .",
    "if we label the links of the path by consecutive numbers from @xmath74 to @xmath72 , we can write  : @xmath75^n   \\",
    "i \\vec{p } \\vec{x } } \\ : , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the characteristic function of the probability distribution @xmath56  : @xmath77 it is important that the results of the integrations ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) do not depend on the internal geometry of the underlying tree graph .",
    "in particular , using ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) we find the partition function ( [ zeromode ] ) , the one - point and two - point correlation functions to reduce to the following form  : @xmath78 we have denoted the ( canonical ) two - point function of the internal geometry by @xmath79  : @xmath80 it is normalized to unity  : @xmath81 .",
    "the normalized internal two - point function gives us the probability that two randomly chosen vertices on a random tree of size @xmath16 are separated by @xmath72 links . in the last formula the geodesic internal distance between the vertices @xmath65 and @xmath69 is denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "the expressions ( [ izn ] ) for @xmath46 , ( [ g1 ] ) for @xmath83 and ( [ g2 ] ) for @xmath84 are independent of the link weight factor @xmath56 .",
    "thus the properties of the internal geometry , as mentioned , can be considered independently of and prior to the embedding .",
    "the external two - point function @xmath85 can be interpreted as the probability density for two random vertices on a tree of size @xmath16 to be embedded in the external space with the relative position @xmath86 .",
    "the probability normalization condition reads  : @xmath87 the right hand side of ( [ g2 ] ) can be understood as a conditional probability .",
    "first , we choose two random vertices on a tree of size @xmath16 and calculate the probability @xmath79 that there are @xmath72 links on the path connecting them . for this path , which is a random path in the embedding space consisting of @xmath72 links",
    ", we can calculate the probability ( density ) @xmath88 that its endpoints are located with the relative position @xmath73 . since the internal geometry decouples from the external one , the probability densities @xmath88 and",
    "@xmath79 are independent of each other and can hence be calculated separately .",
    "similarly , higher correlation functions can be obtained from the corresponding internal correlation functions .",
    "for example , the three - point correlation function is  : @xmath89 the three paths @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 between the vertices @xmath65 , @xmath69 and @xmath93 of the tree can be decomposed into three pieces , namely @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 between them and the common middle point @xmath60 .",
    "the summation indices @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 denote the internal lengths of these pieces , and @xmath100 denotes the position of the common vertex in the external space .",
    "the internal three - point function then reads  : @xmath101 one could extend this construction further .",
    "note that the most important piece of information is already encoded in the two - point function and is inherited by the higher correlation functions . in fact , one can directly derive the higher correlation functions from the two - point function , using a simple composition rule for the tree graphs which enormously simplifies in the grand canonical ensemble . in the next section",
    "we shall thus concentrate on the two - point function .",
    "the canonical two - point correlation functions @xmath79 and @xmath85 contain the information about the fractal structure of the internal and external geometry , respectively .",
    "the average distance for the internal geometry , given by the average number of links between two vertices on the tree , is the first moment of the probability distribution ( [ g2 ] )  : @xmath102 one expects the following scaling behaviour for large @xmath16  : @xmath103 the exponent @xmath1 relates the systems average ( internal ) extent @xmath104 to its size @xmath16 and is thus called the internal hausdorff dimension .",
    "this exponent controls the behaviour for large distances growing with the system size @xmath16 .",
    "one can also introduce a local definition of the fractal dimension for distances in the scaling window @xmath105 .",
    "the scaling window contains distances between the scale of the ultraviolet cut - off and below the infrared scale set by the system size .",
    "this is a sort of thermodynamic definition which becomes valid locally for sufficently large @xmath16 . in a large system",
    "one can be interested in how the volume of a local ball ( or sphere ) depends on its radius @xmath72 .",
    "the volume of the sphere can be calculated as the number of vertices lying @xmath72 links apart from a given vertex  : @xmath106 the definition @xmath0 is more practical for a local observer , for example , someone who lives in a fractal geometry and wants to determine its fractal dimension .",
    "the global definition @xmath1 is accessible only for an observer who can survey the whole system from outside @xcite .    in a similar way we can define the external hausdorff dimension . in order to do this",
    "we first have to introduce a measure of the systems extent in the external space .",
    "such a measure is provided by the gyration radius  : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the target space position of the systems center of mass .",
    "the statistical average of the gyration radius is directly related to the two - point function , namely  : @xmath109 since the gyration radius is a translationally invariant quantity we have to normalize it with the total volume of the target space and rather refer to its average density .",
    "the external hausdorff dimension @xmath110 can then be read off from the large @xmath16 behaviour  : @xmath111 the dependence on the volume @xmath50 is hidden in an @xmath16-independent constant which is not displayed in the last formula .",
    "the symbol @xmath112 referes to the leading behaviour .    for trees of sufficently large size @xmath16 one can also define a local fractal dimension @xmath2 @xcite of the external geometry by measuring the average number of vertices within a spherical shell of radius @xmath113 from the scaling window @xmath114 , which is defined above the ultraviolet cut - off scale and below the infrared scale . as follows from the definition ( [ gnn ] ) for the case of two - point function , the number of vertices within a spherical shell of width @xmath115 is given by the two - point function  @xcite  : @xmath116 here we have used the fact that the the two - point function is spherically symmetric , i.e. @xmath117 . the integral over the @xmath9-dimensional angular part is included in the proportionality constant . in the large @xmath16 limit one",
    "expects the existence of a window @xmath114 where the two - point function exhibits the scaling behaviour  @xcite  : @xmath118 if @xmath119 is negative then @xmath120 behaves as a slow varying function of @xmath121 , which can in a narrow range and with some corrections be viewed as a constant @xmath122 . thus depending on the value of @xmath119   we have  : @xmath123 in the first case @xmath124 the number of points in a spherical shell @xmath125 grows with the power of the canonical dimension @xmath9 . only in the second one @xmath126 the fractal nature leaves traces in the calculation of @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we will shortly summarize results concerning the classification of the scaling behaviour according to the internal geometry of the trees @xcite .",
    "one defines the critical exponent @xmath127 of the grand - canonical susceptibility via  : @xmath128 where @xmath129 controls the behaviour of the partition function at the radius of convergence @xmath130 of the series ( [ grandz ] ) . here",
    "@xmath131 is the critical value of the chemical potential .",
    "if @xmath127 is positive the susceptibility @xmath132 itself is divergent at @xmath133 .",
    "if it is negative , the right - hand - side of the last equation should be understood as the most singular part of the susceptibility , which after taking higher derivatives , will give the leading divergence .",
    "the primary classification of the universality classes for models of branched geometry is based on the value of the susceptibility exponent @xmath127 .",
    "the susceptibility exponent gives the subexponential behaviour of the canonical coefficents @xmath134 for large @xmath16  : @xmath135 .",
    "indeed , if one inserts this form to the definition of the partition function ( [ grandz ] ) , one obtains  : @xmath136    the susceptibility @xmath137 is proportional to the first derivative of the grand - canonical partition function @xmath138 for planted rooted trees , defined by equation ( [ caphi ] ) in the appendix  : @xmath139 .",
    "the reason , why this relation is useful is , that there exists a closed relation  a so - called self - consistency relation ( [ sc ] )  for @xmath138  : @xmath140 which can be inverted for @xmath141 and from which one can extract the singular part of @xmath138  : @xmath142 and hence also of @xmath132 .",
    "note that the denominator of ( [ gofphi ] ) is nothing but the first derivative of the potential @xmath143 defined ( [ v ] ) within the appendix .",
    "one can invert the function @xmath144 in the region where it is strictly monotonous . generically @xmath144",
    "grows monotonically from zero for @xmath145 to some critical value @xmath146 at @xmath147 where @xmath148 .",
    "clearly the inverse function @xmath138 has a square root singularity at @xmath146  : @xmath149 then .",
    "it follows that @xmath150 for the class of generic trees .",
    "the region of the monotonous growths of the function on the right hand side of ( [ gofphi ] ) may be limited by @xmath147 being the radius of convergence of the series in the denominator of @xmath144 .",
    "the inverse function @xmath151 is then singular at @xmath152 with a singularity inherited from the singular behaviour of @xmath144 at @xmath147 .",
    "it can be shown that in this case the susceptibility exponent is negative and the corresponding trees are collapsed .",
    "in the marginal situation the two conditions which limit the region of the monotonous growth of @xmath144 work collectively at a point @xmath147 being at the same time the radius of convergence of the series in the denominator of @xmath144 and the zero of the derivative @xmath148 . in this case",
    "the exponent @xmath127 can assume any value within the interval @xmath153 .",
    "trees which belong to this class are called scale - free @xcite . + the three classes correspond to different scaling behaviours of the two - point function as will be discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we shall calculate the two - point function for the internal geometry .",
    "this function will enable us to determine the scaling and the fractal properties of the internal geometry of tree graphs . as we will show they are different for generic , collapsed and scale - free trees .",
    "in the appendix we deduce an explicit formula ( [ tpdef ] ) for the grand - canonical two - point function @xmath154 .",
    "this function is singular for @xmath155 , and singularity is related to the large @xmath16-behaviour of the canonical two - point function @xmath156 .",
    "the singularity of @xmath154 can be determined directly from the identity ( [ tpdef ] ) by inserting the most singular part of @xmath157 to @xmath158 and @xmath159 . here",
    "we will show an alternative way using a standard scaling argument from statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "denote the singularity exponent of the two - point funtion by @xmath160  : @xmath161 where @xmath93 is a constant which only depends on the particular choice of the weights @xmath25 .",
    "the exponent @xmath160 is usually called mass exponent . summing over distances @xmath72 we",
    "obtain the susceptibility ( [ susc ] )  : @xmath162 according to the definition ( [ susc ] ) , the susceptibility exponent is @xmath127 .",
    "thus we have @xmath163 this relation is the fisher scaling relation for this case . since we have already determined @xmath127 we do not have to calculate @xmath160 additionally . the scaling argument given above holds only for positive @xmath127 , since in this case the susceptibility is divergent and the divergent part dominates the small @xmath164 behaviour . for negative @xmath127",
    "the left hand side of ( [ susc ] ) is not divergent which means that it behaves as a constant as @xmath164 goes to zero . in this case , if one compares the result of the integration ( [ integ ] ) to the leading behaviour of ( [ susc ] ) , one shall effective see that @xmath165 .",
    "this is what happens in the collapsed phase .",
    "now , inserting the most singular part of the grand - canonical two - point function ( [ gsing ] ) to the inverse laplace transform ( [ git ] ) we can deduce the large @xmath16 behaviour of the canonical two - point function  : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the lvy distribution with the index @xmath160 , the maximal asymmetry and the range @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath16 asymptotic behaviour of @xmath169 with @xmath170 is given by the following series @xcite  : @xmath171 for large @xmath16 and fixed @xmath72 , the first term dominates the behaviour of the series  : @xmath172 we see from the formulae ( [ gl2 ] ) and ( [ levy ] ) that the two - point correlation function in the large @xmath16 limit is effectively a function of the argument @xmath173 .",
    "indeed , if one changes the integration variable @xmath174 in ( [ levy ] ) to @xmath175 one obtains  : @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is a function of a single argument @xmath178 . for later convenience",
    "we also included @xmath160 into the definition of the universal argument . using the saddle point approximation to the integral ( [ levy ] )",
    "one can find that for large @xmath178 the function @xmath177 leads to : @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the average internal distance between two vertices can then be calculated  : @xmath182 comparing the @xmath16-dependence on the right hand side of this equation to the @xmath16-dependence on the right hand side of equation ( [ ddh ] ) , which defines the internal hausdorff dimension @xmath1 , we see that @xmath1 is the inverse of @xmath160  : @xmath183    thus , the hausdorff dimension is @xmath14 for generic trees . for scale - free trees @xmath1 changes continuously from @xmath184 to @xmath185 since @xmath127 belongs to the interval @xmath186 then @xcite .    on the other hand we see from ( [ lmu ] ) that for large @xmath16 and small @xmath72 the normalized two - point function grows linearly with @xmath72 , i.e.  : @xmath187 the normalization coefficent behaves as @xmath188 in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "since the sum over this function is proportional to the number of vertices in the distance @xmath72 from a given vertex , the last formula tells us that the local hausdorff dimension is @xmath4 .",
    "we see that locally for sufficently large @xmath16 , it is difficult to distinguish the scale - free trees from the generic ones by measuring short internal distances , since both classes have the same internal hausdorff dimension @xmath4 .",
    "one has to go to large distances to see different scaling properties depending on the type of the ensemble ( [ spoint ] ) . for collapsed trees the hausdorff dimension is infinite .",
    "in this case , the universal scaling argument @xmath189 of the two - point function is proportional to @xmath72 but it does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "this is related to the fact discussed before that the effective value of the exponent @xmath160 is equal zero .",
    "the saddle point approximation ( [ spoint ] ) actually gives the exact result for @xmath190 for the whole range of @xmath189 .",
    "the reason for this is that in this case the integrand of the approximated expression ( [ levy ] ) is gaussian .",
    "for some specific values of @xmath160 one can express the laplace transform ( [ levy ] ) in terms of special functions .",
    "for example for @xmath191  : @xmath192 where @xmath193 . for large @xmath189 the saddle point formula ( [ spoint ] ) coincides with this one , while for small @xmath189 the two functions deviate a little from each other .",

    "@xmath373 , where @xmath372 is a solution of equation ( [ gofphi ] )  : @xmath374 in this case the two - point function simplifies to  : @xmath375 the inversion of equation ( [ muphi ] ) for @xmath138 gives @xmath376 , when @xmath377 .",
    "thus the two - point function can be approximated in this limit by  : @xmath378 we have neglected a term linear in @xmath164 in the exponent , because we are interested in the limit @xmath379 for which @xmath380 . what matters in this limit is the leading term in @xmath164 which is related to the large @xmath16-behaviour of the underlying canonical - ensemble  : @xmath381 where @xmath382 is the two - point function for the canonical ensemble for trees of size @xmath16 . in the last formula we split into @xmath383 , where @xmath131 is the critical value of @xmath371 at which the partition function is singular .",
    "the leading terms in @xmath164 of @xmath384 are responsible for the scaling behaviour while the next - to - leading ones for finite - size corrections .",
    "formula ( [ lt ] ) is a discrete laplace transform .",
    "since we are interested in the large @xmath16 behaviour of @xmath382 , we can substitute the discrete by a continuous laplace transform .",
    "the inverse transform then yields  : @xmath385    in particular , for the case discussed here ( see([g22 ] ) ) the exact result reads  : @xmath386 we inserted @xmath359 in the last formula .",
    "the normalized two - point function can be approximated by  : @xmath387 the constant @xmath93 in the last formula is equal @xmath74 .",
    "we displayed this constant , because the same formula holds for generic trees in general , but with a constant which depends on the choice of the weights .",
    "we used two approximations in the last formula .",
    "we substituted @xmath388 by @xmath72 .",
    "the difference between the function with @xmath72 and @xmath388 disappears in the large @xmath16-limit .",
    "secondly , the numerator and the denominator in the normalized two - point function ( [ ggn2 ] ) have a common part @xmath389 which does not depend on @xmath72 .",
    "it cancels out . the remaining part  : @xmath188 is a normalization constant ensuring @xmath390 . for finite @xmath16 there will be some corrections to the normalization constant @xmath188 , but these disappear exponentially in the large @xmath16 limit .",
