    "nearly 30 years ago , toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) elegantly demonstrated that the tails and bridges emanating from many peculiar galaxies may arise kinematically from dynamically cold disk material torn off of the outer regions of galaxies experiencing strong gravitational interactions .",
    "early spectroscopic studies of gas within the tidal tails of merging galaxies provided observational support for this hypothesis by showing the tails to have the kinematics expected for a gravitational origin ( e.g.  stockton 1974a , b ) .",
    "h@xmath0i   mapping studies are particularly well suited to such studies , as the tidally ejected disk material is usually rich in neutral hydrogen and can be traced to very large distances from the merging systems ( e.g.  van der hulst 1979 ; simkin _ et  al . _   1986",
    "; appleton _ et  al . _",
    "1981 , 1987 ; yun _ et  al . _   1994 ) .",
    "once mapped , the tidal kinematics can be used either alone , to disentangle the approximate spin geometry of the encounter ( stockton 1974a , b ; mihos _ et  al . _   1993",
    "; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 , hereafter hvg96 ; mihos & bothun 1998 ) , or in concert with detailed numerical models , to constrain the full encounter geometry ( e.g.  combes 1978 ; combes _ et  al . _   1988",
    "; yun 1992 , 1997 ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ; gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "however , not all systems can be easily explained by purely gravitational models such as those used by toomre & toomre .",
    "for example , gravitational forces by themselves should not lead to differences between stellar and gaseous tidal components .",
    "numerical models which include hydrodynamical effects do predict a decoupling of the dissipative gaseous and non - dissipative stellar components ( e.g.  noguchi 1988 ; barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ; weil & hernquist 1993 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; appleton , charmandaris & struck 1996 ; struck 1997 ) , but only in the inner regions or along bridges where gas orbits may physically intersect ( see e.g.  fig .  4 of mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "decoupling of the gaseous and stellar components within the tidal tails is not expected .    nonetheless , differences between the optical and gaseous tidal morphologies have been observed .",
    "these differences can be subtle , with the peak optical and h@xmath0i   surface brightnesses simply displaced by a few kpc within the tails ( e.g. ngc 4747 , wevers _",
    "et  al . _   1984",

    "; arp 295a , ngc 4676b , and ngc 520 southern tail , hibbard 1995 , hvg96 ) , or they can be extreme , with extensive h@xmath0i   tidal features apparently decoupled from , or even anti - correlated with , the optical tidal features .",
    "it is this latter category of objects that we wish to address in this paper . in particular",
    ", we address the morphology of the tidal gas and starlight in the merging systems ngc 520 ( arp 157 ) , arp 220 , and arp 299 ( ngc 3690 ) .",
    "the three systems were observed as part of our on - going studies on the tidal morphologies of optically and ir selected mergers ( hibbard 1995 , hvg96 , hibbard & yun 1996 and in prep . ) .",
    "these studies involve moderate resolution ( @xmath3 ) vla  h@xmath0ispectral - line mapping observations and deep optical @xmath4   and @xmath5broad - band imaging with large format ccds using the kpno 0.9 m ( ngc 520 ) and the university of hawaii 88   telescopes .",
    "the h@xmath0i   and optical observations , reduction , and data products have been presented in hibbard ( 1995 ) and hvg96 for ngc 520 , in hibbard & yun ( 1999 , hereafter hy99 ) for arp 299 , and in yun & hibbard ( 2000 ; see also hibbard & yun 1996 ) for arp 220 .",

    "there is a bright optical tidal tail stretching 24 kpc to the southeast ( henceforth referred to as the s tail ) which bends sharply eastward and connects onto a broad optical plume .",

    "the primary nucleus ( the easternmost nucleus in fig .",
    "[ fig : n520mos]a ) possesses a massive ( @xmath11 ) 1 kpc - scale rotating molecular gas disk ( sanders _ et  al . _   1988",
    "; yun & hibbard 1999 ) . an h@xmath0idisk is kinematically centered on this molecular disk , and extends to a radius of @xmath12 20 kpc ( labeled `` inner disk '' in fig .",

    "[ fig : n520mos]b ) , and a nearly complete outer ring of h@xmath0i   with a mean radius of 60 kpc , which extends smoothly through the dwarf galaxy ucg 957 ( only partially seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : n520mos]b ) .",
    "there is a kinematic and morphological continuity between the molecular gas disk , the inner h@xmath0i   disk , and outer h@xmath0i   ring ( yun & hibbard 1999 ) , which suggests that all of this material is associated with the primary nucleus .",
    "the observations suggests that the ngc 520 interaction involved a prograde - retrograde or prograde - polar spin geometry : the linear morphology of the optical tail - to - plume system is typical of features produced by a disk experiencing a prograde encounter ( i.e. , the disk rotates in the same direction as the merging systems orbit each other ) .",
    "the disk - like morphology and rotational kinematics of the large - scale hi and the lack of any aligned linear tidal features , on the other hand , are more typical of polar or retrograde encounter geometries ( i.e. , disk rotation either perpendicular to or opposite the direction of orbital motion ) .",
    "such encounters fail to raise significant tails ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes 1988 ) , and much of the disk material remains close to its original rotational plane .",
    "neither the intermediate nor the outer h@xmath0i   ring has an optical counterpart ( @xmath13@xmath14 27 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) . despite smooth rotational kinematics ,",
    "this outer h@xmath0i   has a very clumpy and irregular morphology , with notable gaps near the optical minor axis ( labeled `` ne gap '' and `` sw gap '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : n520mos]c ) .",
    "this figure shows that the outer h@xmath0i   and optical structures are anti - correlated , with the peak h@xmath0i   column densities ( associated with the n clump ) located to one side of the optical plume . in fig .",

    "[ fig : n520mos]d , showing that the gas column density increases precisely where the optical light decreases .",
    "while the h@xmath0i  features exhibit a clear rotational kinematic signature , the well - defined edges and nearly - linear structure of the optical plume suggests that its constituent stars are moving predominantly along the plume , rather than in the plane of the sky : any substantial differential rotation would increase the width of the plume and result in a more disk - like morphology .",
    "we therefore conclude that the gas rings and optical plume are both morphologically and kinematically distinct entities .",
    "this suggests that the observed gas / star anti - correlation is either transient ( and fortuitous ) or actively maintained by some process .",
    "a deep h@xmath8  image of ngc 520 shows plumes of ionized gas emerging both north and south along the minor axis and reaching a projected height of 3 kpc from the nucleus ( hvg96 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that this plume represents a starburst - driven outflow of ionized gas ( hvg96 , norman _",

    "figures  [ fig : n520mos][fig : slices ] provide evidence for both small- and large - scale differences in the distributions of the tidal gas and stars in these three systems .",
    "the small - scale differences are of the type illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] , whereby the gas column density falls off just as the optical surface brightness increases at various edges of the tidal features . in ngc 520 and arp 220 ,",
    "the large - scale differences are between the outer h@xmath0i   rings and disks ( which have no associated starlight ) and the optical tails and plumes ( which have no associated h@xmath0i ) .",
    "although these features are kinematically decoupled at present ( with the gas rings and disks predominantly in rotation and the optical tails and plumes predominantly in expansion ) , it is possible that they had a common origin and have subsequently decoupled and evolved separately . in arp 299 , on the other hand , the h@xmath0i   filaments and optical tail have similar morphologies and continuous kinematics and are therefore part of the same kinematic structure . in this system",
    "we believe the bifurcated tidal morphology results from a progenitor with a warped gaseous disk (  [ sec : a299 ] & hy99 ) , and we seek to understand why the inner filament is gas - poor , given that its progenitor was obviously gas - rich .    in this section",
    "we investigate a number of possible explanations for these observations .",
    "in particular , we discuss the possible role played by : differences in the initial radial distribution of the gas and stars (  [ sec : radial ] ) , dust obscuration (  [ sec : dust ] ) , kinematic decoupling of the gas due to collisions within the developing tidal tail (  [ sec : coll ] ) , ram pressure stripping of the gas , either by a halo or by a galactic scale wind (  [ sec : rps ] ) , and photoionization of the gas , either by the starburst or by local sources (  [ sec : ioniz ] ) .      in interacting systems",
    "the h@xmath0i   is often more widely distributed than the optical light ( see , e.g. the h@xmath0i   map of the m81 system by yun _ et  al . _   1994",
    "; see also van der hulst 1979 ; appleton , davies & stephenson 1981 ) .",
    "these gas - rich extensions frequently have no associated starlight down to very faint limits ( e.g. simkin _ et  al . _   1986",
    "; hvg96 ) .",
    "a natural explanation is that such features arise from the h@xmath0i - rich but optically faint outer radii of the progenitor disks .",
    "the relatively short lifetimes of luminous stars and the larger velocity dispersions of less luminous stars , especially with respect to the gas , will further dilute the luminous content of this material , and the h@xmath0i - to - light ratio of the resulting tidal features will increase with time ( hibbard _ et  al . _",
    "gaseous tidal extensions with very little detectable starlight would seem to be the natural consequence .",
    "the outer h@xmath0i   rings in ngc 520 and arp 220 and the gas - rich outer filament in arp 299 are all likely to have arisen in this manner",
    ".    however , gas - rich outer disks can not give rise to gas - poor optical structures , such as the optical plume in ngc 520 , the optical tail in arp 220 , or the inner filament in arp 299 .",
    "since these features presumably arise from optically brighter regions of the progenitor disks ( regions which are characterized by h@xmath0i   column densities higher than that of the outer disks ) one would have expected a priori that these features should also be gas - rich .",
    "it is possible that the disks which gave rise to the plumes in ngc 520 and arp 220 were gas - poor at all radii .",
    "however , this would not account for the discontinuities in the outer gaseous features that project near these optical features ( i.e. , ne gap in ngc 520 and nw gap in arp 220 ) .",
    "we therefore seek other explanations for these structures .",
    "the correspondence between rising gas column density and falling optical surface brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] ) suggests that dust associated with the cold gas may attenuate the optical light . to address this possibility ,",
    "we calculate the expected extinction in the @xmath23band for a given column density of h@xmath0i .",
    "we adopt the milky way dust - to - gas ratio determined by bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ; @xmath24= 4.8 mag@xmath19 ) , which is supported by direct imaging of the cold dust in the outer regions of eight disk galaxies ( alton _ et  al . _",
    "this is combined with the galactic extinction law of odonnell ( 1994 ; @xmath25 , from table 6 of schlegel _",
    "et  al._1998 ) to yield an expected extinction in the @xmath5-band of @xmath26 mag .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] , the peak h@xmath0i   column densities on either side of the optical features are @xmath123 .",
    "the predicted extinction is therefore of order 0.2 mag in the @xmath5-band . from fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] we see that the mean light level drops by about 1.0 mag arcsec@xmath15   for arp 299 ( from 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath15   to below 27.5 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) , about 1.5 mag arcsec@xmath15   for ngc 520 ( from 25 mag arcsec@xmath15   to below 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) , and by about 2.5 mag arcsec@xmath15   for arp 220 ( from 23.5 mag arcsec@xmath15   to below 26 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) along the extracted slices . to produce this amount of extinction , the tidal gas would have to have a dust - to - gas ratio that is ten times that in the milky way .",
    "the above analysis assumes that the measured neutral gas column density represents the total gas column density .",
    "however , the sharp drop in h@xmath0i   column density observed in many tidal features ( hvg96 , hibbard & yun in preparation ) suggests that the tidal gas may be highly ionized by the intergalactic uv field ( see also references in  [ sec : ioniz ] ) .",
    "since large dust grains should survive in the presence of this ionizing radiation , the opacity per atom of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath27 ) should increase in regions of increasing ionization fraction .",
    "observations of ngc 5018 ( hilker & kissler - patig 1996 ) , in which blue globular clusters are absent in a region underlying an associated h@xmath0i  tidal stream , may support a high @xmath27 ratio for tidal gas .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of obvious reddening of the @xmath28 colors along the slices in arp 299 and ngc 520 ( hibbard 1995 ; hy99 ) argues against a much higher extinction in these regions .",
    "we conclude that extinction might be important for shaping the morphology of the faintest optical features ( e.g. , the `` hook '' and the end of the optical tail of arp 299 , fig .  [ fig : a299mos ] , which has @xmath13   near the detection limit of 28 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) , but is insufficient to greatly affect the overall tidal morphology .",
    "however , an anomalously high tidal dust - to - gas ratio remains a possibility .",
    "this question could be resolved by the direct detection of cold dust in tidal tails with sub - millimeter imaging .      during the tail formation process , the leading - edge of the tail",
    "is decelerated with respect to the center of mass of the progenitors , while the trailing - edge is accelerated , and the two edges move towards each other ( see toomre & toomre 1972 , fig .",
    "eventually , the two edges appear to cross , forming a caustic ( wallin 1990 ; struck - marcell 1990 ) . in most cases ,",
    "the caustics are simply due to projection effects . only for low - inclination encounters",
    "will these crossings correspond to physical density enhancements , and numerical experiments suggest that in these cases the density will increase by factors of a few ( wallin 1990 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that collisions experienced by the crossing tidal streams in such low - inclination encounters may lead to a separation between the dissipational ( gas ) and non - dissipational ( stellar ) tidal components ( wevers 1984 ; smith _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the present data do not allow us to directly address this question , since the kinematic decoupling presumably took place long ago . however , several arguments lead us to suspect that this collisional process is not important in tidal tails : ( 1 ) large scale decoupling between the stellar and gaseous tidal morphologies is not seen in many systems known to have experienced low - inclination encounters ( e.g. ngc 4038/9 , `` the antennae '' , hibbard _",
    "et  al . _   in preparation ; ngc 7252 `` atoms for peace '' hibbard",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "1994 ; ngc 4676 `` the mice '' hvg96 ) ; ( 2 ) the broad plume - like morphologies of the optical features in arp 220 and ngc 520 suggest rather inclined encounters (   [ sec : n520 ] , [ sec : a220 ] ) , in which case wide - spread collisions are not expected ; and ( 3 ) the parallel filaments in the arp 299 tail have identical kinematics , whereas one would expect kinematic differences between the stripped and unstripped material .",
    "therefore while gaseous collisions and dissipation might result in differences between gas and stars during tidal development ( particularly along tidal bridges , where the gas streamlines are converging ; e.g. struck 1997 ; ngc 7714/5 smith _",
    "et  al . _   1997",
    "; arp 295 hvg96 ) , we believe that they are not likely to lead to a wide - spread decoupling in the outer regions .",
    "if the tidal features pass through a diffuse warm or hot medium , or if such a medium passes through the tidal features , it is possible that the tidal gas exchanges energy and momentum with this medium due to collisions .",
    "such effects have been proposed to explain the stripping of the cool interstellar medium from spiral galaxies as they move through the hot igm in clusters ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , and is referred to as ram pressure stripping ( rps ) .",
    "tidal features should be relatively easily stripped , as they lack the natural restoring forces present in disk galaxies , except possibly at a small number of self - gravitating regions . in this case , the momentum imparted due to ram pressure is simply added to or subtracted from the momentum of the gaseous tidal features , and a separation of stellar and gaseous components might be expected .    in the next two subsections , we investigate two possible sources for ram pressure : an extended halo associated with the progenitors (  [ sec : rpshalo ] ) ; and an expanding starburst driven superwind (  [ sec : rpswind ] ) .      our own galaxy is known to have an extended halo of hot gas ( pietz _ et  al._1998 ) .",
    "the existence of similar halos around external galaxies has been inferred from observations of absorption line systems around bright galaxies ( e.g.  lanzetta _ et  al . _",
    "these halos may have sufficient density to strip any low column density gas moving through them .",
    "several investigators have suggested that such stripping is responsible for removing gas from the magellanic clouds as they orbit through the galaxy s halo , producing the purely gaseous magellanic stream ( e.g.  meurer , bicknell & gingold 1985 ; sofue 1994 ; moore & davis 1994 ) .",
    "sofue & wakamatsu ( 1993 ) and sofue ( 1994 ) specifically stress that stripping by galaxy halos should also play an important role in the evolution of h@xmath0i   tidal tails .",
    "the tidal features in each of our systems have h@xmath0i   column densities and velocities similar to those assumed in the numerical models of sofue ( 1994 ) and moore & davis ( 1994 ) , which resulted in rather extreme stripping of the h@xmath0i   clouds .",
    "although this may seem to provide an immediate explanation for our observations of gas / star displacements , we point out that these column densities and velocities are typical of all of the tails thus far imaged in h@xmath0i , the great majority of which do not show the extreme displacements we describe here .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the halo properties of ngc 520 , arp 299 and arp 220 are any different from , or that the encounters were any more violent than similar mergers which do not exhibit such dramatic displacements ( e.g. , ngc 4038/9 , ngc 7252 , ngc 4676 hvg96 ; ngc 3628 dahlem",

    "in fact , in light of the stripping simulations mentioned above , one wonders why such displacements are not more common .    a possible solution to this puzzle",
    "is suggested by the results of numerical simulations of major mergers . in these simulations ,",
    "the material distributed throughout the halos of the progenitors is tidally distended along with the tails , forming a broad sheath around them ( see e.g.  the video accompanying barnes 1992 ) .",
    "this sheath has similar kinematics as the colder tail material , resulting in much lower relative velocities than if the tail was moving through a static halo , thereby greatly reducing any relative ram pressure force .    in summary ,",
    "while halo stripping might be effective for discrete systems moving through a static halo ( such as the lmc / smc through the halo of the galaxy , or disks through a hot cluster igm ) , the lack of widespread h@xmath0i / optical decoupling in mergers suggests that it is not very effective for removing gas from tidal tails , and it does not appear to be a suitable explanation of the present observations .",
    "the three systems under discussion host massive nuclear starbursts with associated powerful outflows or  superwinds \" . optical emission lines and/or x - ray emission",
    "reveal that the observed outflows extend for tens of kpc from the nuclear regions .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest that the observed gas plumes represent just the hottest , densest regions of a much more extensive , lower density medium ( wang 1995 ) . in each of these three systems ,",

    "it has been suggested that this anti - correlation is due to an interaction between the blown - out gas of the superwind and the cold gaseous tidal debris , either as the wind expands outward into the debris , or as the tidal debris passes through the wind ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; heckman , armus & miley 1987 , and references above ) .",

    "is dominated by a cooler component with a smaller scale height and velocity dispersion , while the h@xmath0i  beyond the optical disk is warmer and more diffuse , with a larger scale height and velocity dispersion ( braun 1995 , 1997 ) . as a result , @xmath43 should be considerably larger for purely gaseous tidal features than for optically bright tidal features .",
    "in this paper we have described differences between gaseous and stellar tidal features .",
    "there are large - scale differences , such as extensive purely gaseous tidal features ( the outer disks in ngc 520 and arp 220 and the outer filament in arp 299 ) and largely gas - poor optical features ( tidal plumes in ngc 520 and arp 220 and the inner filament in arp 299 ) . and there are smaller - scale differences : the anti - correlation between the edges of gaseous and optical features depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] .",
    "a similar anti - correlation is observed between h@xmath0i   and optical shells in shell galaxies ( schiminovich _ et  al . _   1994a , b , 1999 )",
    ", many of which are believe to be more evolved merger remnants .",
    "we have examined a number of possible explanations for these observations , including dust obscuration , differences in the original distribution of gas and starlight in the progenitor disks , gas cloud collisions within the developing tails , ram pressure stripping due to an extensive hot halo or an expanding superwind , and photoionization by either the central starburst or evolved sources in the tidal tails themselves . however , no one model easily and completely explains the observations , and it is conceivable that all explanations are playing a role at some level .    the most likely explanation for the lack of starlight associated with the outer tidal h@xmath0iis that such features arise from the h@xmath0i - rich but optically faint outer radii of the progenitor disks . the relatively short lifetimes of luminous stars and the large velocity dispersions of less luminous stars , especially with respect to the gas , will further dilute the luminous content of this material , and the h@xmath0i - to - light ratio of the resulting tidal features will increase with time ( hibbard _ et  al . _",
    "gaseous tidal extensions with very little detectable starlight would seem to be the natural consequence .",
    "the outer h@xmath0i   rings in ngc 520 and arp 220 and the gas - rich outer filament in arp 299 are all likely to arise from these gas - rich regions of their progenitor disks .    for the gas - poor tidal features we suggest that the starburst has played an important role in shaping the gaseous morphology , either by sweeping the features clear of gas via a high - pressure expanding superwind , or by excavating a clear sightline towards the starburst and allowing ionizing photons to penetrate the tidal regions .",
    "the primary supporting evidence for this conclusion is rather circumstantial : the five galaxies with the most striking h@xmath0i / optical displacements ( the three systems currently under study here , and the h@xmath0i   accreting starburst systems m82 and ngc 4631 ) host massive nuclear starbursts with associated powerful outflows or superwinds aligned with the direction of the most extreme h@xmath0i / optical displacements .",
    "ngc 520 , arp 299 , and arp 220 each experienced prograde / polar or prograde / retrograde encounters .",
    "this relative geometry may be a pre - requisite for the morphological differences reported here .",
    "retrograde and polar encounters do not raise extensive tidal tails ( e.g. barnes 1988 ) , leaving large gaseous disks in the inner regions .",
    "these disks should help collimate and `` mass - load '' the superwind ( heckman , lehnert & armus 1993 ; suchkov _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) , which in turn leads to denser and longer - lived winds .",
    "simultaneously , the combination of opposite spin geometries provides the opportunity for the tidal tail from the prograde system to rise above the starburst region in the polar or retrograde system , where it may intersect the escaping superwind or uv radiation .",
    "if this suggestion is correct , only systems hosting a galactic superwind and experiencing a high - inclination encounter geometry should exhibit such extreme differences between their h@xmath0i  and optical tidal morphologies .    the observations do not allow us to discriminate between either the rps or the photoionization models : simple calculations suggest that either is capable of affecting the diffuse outer gas if the geometry is right",
    ". there might be some evidence for the effects of an impinging wind on the outer material in arp 299 from the increased velocity dispersion at several points ( hy99 ) ; however ngc 520 and arp 220 show no such signatures .",
    "photoionization is an attractive solution , as it offers a means of explaining the lack of tidal h@xmath0i  found at the base of otherwise gas - rich tidal tails in mergers which show no evidence of a superwind ( e.g. ngc 7252 , arp 105 , ngc 4039 ; see ",
    "[ sec : ionizsb ] ) .",
    "since any ionized hydrogen will emit recombination lines , both explanations can be checked observationally .",
    "the expected emission measure is given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : em ] ) , which predicts detectable features at the column densities of interest .",
    "the morphology of the ionized gas should reveal the nature of the ionizing source : photoionized gas should be smoothly distributed , while gas excited by rps should be concentrated in dense shocked regions on the edges of the h@xmath0i   that are being compressed by the superwind , _",
    "i.e. _   on the edges nearest the wind axis in figs .",
    "[ fig : n520mos]d , [ fig : a299mos]d & [ fig : a220mos]d .",
    "if the gas is clumpy , there may be regions bright enough to allow line ratios to be measured , which should further aid in discriminating between photoionization or shock excitation .",
    "only two scenarios are offered to explain the small - scale anti - correlations : dust obscuration and photoionization due to evolved sources in the optical tails .",
    "dust obscuration likely affects the apparent tidal morphologies at the lowest light levels , but we suspect that the dust content is too low to significantly obscure the brighter tidal features .",
    "however , if the tidal tails are highly ionized , with the neutral gas representing only a small fraction of the total hydrogen column density , it is possible that we are grossly underestimating the expected amount of absorption .",
    "this question can be investigated directly with submm imaging of the cold dust in tidal tails .",
    "the other possibility is that the uv flux from evolved sources in the optical tails is responsible for ionizing nearby diffuse outer h@xmath0i .",
    "a simple calculation suggest that the tidal tail in arp 220 is bright enough to ionize nearby h@xmath0i , but the expected ionization flux from the optical tails in ngc 520 and arp 299 is too low to explain the observed differences , unless significant star formation continued within these features after their tidal ejection .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the regions where the neutral gas column density drops rapidly ( see fig.[fig : slices ] ) should contain ionized gas which would emit recombination radiation .",
    "the expected levels of emission should be observable with deep imaging techniques ( see above ) .",
    "this situation requires that the gas and stellar features are physically close , and not just close in projection , which can tested with detailed numerical simulations .",
