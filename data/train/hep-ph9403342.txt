    "the measurement of deep inelastic @xmath4 scattering at hera will allow to extend the kinematical range to @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite . because of differences in the detector response and resolution @xcite different ways to measure the kinematical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 have to be used to cover the full kinematical range .",
    "furthermore , owing to the different properties of detectors the experiments h1 and zeus @xcite apply different methods in measuring the kinematical variables .",
    "the qed radiative corrections in @xmath9 differ significantly for the various choices of kinematical variables as shown in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the full ( or partial ) integration of the radiated photon s phase space for different kinematical situations according to the experimental requirements . as shown in explicit comparisons between complete and leading log calculations in @xmath9 the results agree to the per cent level for the case of lepton measurement @xcite , jet measurement @xcite , and the case of mixed variables @xcite  . in part of the phase space",
    "the @xmath9 corrections are sizeable .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to calculate the 2nd order corrections to check whether the results obtained are numerically stable .    in this letter",
    "the @xmath0 contributions are calculated in the leading log approximation for the case of jet measurement , mixed variables , the double angle method  @xcite , and a measurement based on @xmath1 and @xmath10  .",
    "the latter two methods have been applied by the zeus collaboration recently in measuring the deep inelastic neutral current cross section @xcite . since the @xmath11 radiative corrections for these cases",
    "have not been given before the corresponding numerical results will be included also .",
    "besides of the second order leading log corrections higher order corrections due to soft exponentiation are given .",
    "the relevant contributions arise from the set of all possible collinear configurations in the diagrams up to @xmath0 .",
    "they are associated with the massless fermion lines ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "one may group the different processes into :    1 .",
    "bremsstrahlung ( diagrams 1a , b , figure 1 ) 2 .",
    "@xmath13 pair creation ( diagram 1c ) , and 3 .",
    "@xmath14 pair production , @xmath15 , ( diagram 1d ) .    among the possible configurations contributions due to initial state and final state radiation both from the lepton and quark lines emerge .",
    "furthermore , the compton scattering of a nearly real intermediary photon , emitted from a quark or proton line and scattered off the electron , @xcite may be considered as a part of the radiative corrections . since the experimental signature of the latter process consists of two nearly balanced electromagnetic showers accompanied by low hadronic activity near the beam pipe , these events are generally not included into the deep inelastic sample .",
    "on the other hand , they may be used to measure the proton structure functions at small @xmath16 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "because of the finite detector resolutions collinear final state radiation is hardly resolved and may be treated integrally  @xcite in the experimental measurement",
    ". due to this also terms with both collinear initial and final state radiation do not emerge .",
    "the initial state radiation from the quark line can be summed using altarelli ",
    "parisi equations @xcite with kernels modified due to the 1st and 2nd order qed corrections , which yields a modification of the parton distributions at the level of 1%  .",
    "because of this , we will consider only the effect of initial state radiation in the following .",
    "for the scattering cross section up to @xmath0 one thus obtains : @xmath17 ^ 2 \\int_0 ^ 1 dz   p_{ee}^{(2,1)}(z ) \\left \\ { \\theta(z - z_0 ) { \\cal j}(x , y , z ) \\frac{d^2 \\sigma^{(0)}}{dx dy } \\left|_{x=\\hat{x } , y=\\hat{y},s=\\hat{s } } \\right . -   \\frac{d^2 \\sigma^{(0)}}{dx dy } \\right \\ } \\nonumber \\ ] ] @xmath18 using standard techniques known from qcd   annihilation processes successfully  @xcite . ] . here",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the born cross section for deep inelastic neutral or charged current @xmath4 reactions ) .",
    "one may easily account for them using dressed born cross sections instead of @xmath20 . ]",
    "e.g. ( 3,4 ) in @xcite ) , and the jacobian @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 the shifted variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the lower bounds of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are listed in table  1 for the different choices of measurement .    both for the double angle method and the measurement based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the rescaled variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish for @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "if _ no _ futher cut is imposed this means that for both methods the radiative corrections are strongly influenced by the non  perturbative range @xmath30 in @xmath31 . in studies by the zeus collaboration , where these two methods have been applied , however , the cut @xmath32 on the reconstructed electron beam energy was imposed , choosing @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 denote the scattering angle of the electron and the jet angle , respectively , and @xmath35 are the energies of the initial electron , scattered electron , and the jet in the laboratory frame . this cut yields @xmath36 in the case of the double angle method and @xmath37 for the measurement based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the double angle method the cut excludes the contributions of the range @xmath30 globally , whereas they are still present in the case of the @xmath38 measurement for @xmath39 .",
    "the splitting functions in ( [ eqma ] ) are : @xmath40 @xmath41(z ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1 + z^2}{1 - z } \\left [ 2\\ln(1-z ) - \\ln z + \\frac{3}{2 } \\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}(1 + z ) \\ln z - ( 1 -z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath42(z )   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & ( 1 + z ) \\ln z + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - z ) + \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{1}{z } ( 1 - z^3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the splitting functions of a photon into an electron , and vice versa .",

    "( [ eq - p23 ] ) is obtained from an expansion of @xmath50 calculating the polarization operator in the on  mass  shell scheme for leptons _ and _ quarks , which can not be done reliably in perturbative qcd in the case of the light quarks .",

    "@xmath51 in terms of _ effective _ quark masses from a fit to @xmath52 as done in  @xcite",

    "they result from diagram  1c in @xmath0 where now the outgoing fermion collinear with the incoming electron is a positron .",
    "the conversion rate equals @xmath70 this quantity is illustrated in figure  2 numerically . for @xmath71 , @xmath72 may reach values of @xmath73 for @xmath74 . depending on the detector resolution the charge of the scattered lepton in deep inelastic @xmath4 collisions might only be measurable in part of the kinematical range . if the charge of the recorded final state electron is ignored in the measurement , also the contribution @xmath75 has to be included in the radiative corrections .",
    "the corresponding contributions are given for the different cases of measurement separately below .",
    "in the numerical calculation the quark distributions are parametrized in the dis scheme using the mrs @xmath76 parton distributions @xcite to illustrate the correction functions @xmath77 for the different type of measurements .",
    "equivalent results are obtained using the recent mrsh  @xcite , cteq  @xcite , or grv  @xcite distributions .",
    "the value of @xmath28 for the structure functions in the radiative orders in ( [ eqma ] ) may become smaller than the usual lower bound @xmath78 for which the chosen parton parametrization applies . because of lorentz invariance the structure functions @xmath79 vanish with @xmath80 .",
    "various parametrizations of this behaviour have been proposed recently  @xcite . here ,",
    "for an illustration , we will adopt a multiplicative factor  @xcite @xmath81~~~{\\rm with}~~~ a^2 = 3.37 { \\,\\mbox{gev}}^{-2}.\\ ] ] for all structure functions in the numerical calculations .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the @xmath3 corrections for the case of jet measurement for neutral current deep inelastic @xmath82 scattering .",
    "the corrections are positive and grow with @xmath16 and @xmath83 . compared with the 1st order results  @xcite",
    "they diminish the negative @xmath9 results in size . in the low @xmath16 range @xmath84 the 2nd order corrections",
    "are found to be less than 1 % . still smaller values are found for the 2nd order contribution due to @xmath69 conversion , which amount to relative corrections @xmath85 only .",
    "the 2nd order corrections for jet measurement in the case of charged current deep inelastic @xmath82 scattering are the same as those of the corresponding neutral current reactions for large @xmath16 , because this range is dominated by the soft and virtual contributions , cf .",
    "figure  4 . for smaller values of @xmath84",
    "they are smaller than 1 % and may become negative , as also the 1st order corrections change sign for small @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the contributions due to @xmath69 conversion are somewhat larger than in the case of neutral current reactions .    for the measurement based on mixed variables , i.e. @xmath8 measured at the leptonic and @xmath2 at the hadronic vertex ( see figure  5 ) , the 2nd order corrections to the neutral current cross section turn out to be less than 1 % in the range @xmath86 .",
    "they become smaller with descending @xmath16 values . for @xmath87",
    "they reach 10 % in the range of small @xmath83 .",
    "note that contrary to the jet measurement the contributions due to @xmath69 conversion become of comparable order as the 2nd order @xmath88 corrections for small @xmath83 in the case of mixed variables .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath0 corrections for the neutral current deep inelastic scattering cross section for a measurement using the double angle method are shown in figure  6 .",
    "both the 1st and 2nd order corrections are nearly flat in @xmath83 .",
    "the corrections become smaller with descending values of @xmath16 and are smaller than 3 % for @xmath84 . due to these properties",
    "the double angle method appears to be an ideal choice to measure the neutral current cross section from the point of view of radiative corrections .",
    "the contributions from @xmath69 conversion are less than @xmath89 .",
    "figure  7 shows the @xmath9 and @xmath0 corrections for the neutral current deep inelastic scattering cross section , where the scattering angle @xmath1 of the electron ond @xmath2 are used to define the kinematical variables . in this case",
    "the corrections grow rapidly in the range @xmath90 and become larger than 100 % for @xmath91 already for @xmath92 .",
    "even larger corrections are obtained for higher @xmath16 values .",
    "this is caused by the shift of the rescaled variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the vicinity of @xmath95 .",
    "the relative correction becomes smaller for very low values of @xmath16 , since the differential cross sections at the rescaled variables and the non - rescaled variables become less different in value there .",
    "the 2nd order corrections are negative .",
    "the contributions due to @xmath69 conversion grow with rising values of @xmath16 and amount to @xmath96 of the born cross section for @xmath87 and larger values of @xmath83 . because in part of the kinematical range the correction @xmath97 is significantly influenced by the behaviour of @xmath20 in the non  perturbative range , a reliable calculation of @xmath97 is only possible knowing the behaviour @xmath20 in the range of @xmath98 . due to",
    "this the plot of @xmath97 in figure  7 serves only to show the _ principal _ behaviour under some assumptions made for @xmath20 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the cross section @xmath99 , which includes the radiative corrections , is well understood with respect to the experimental systematics , one may later try to use the measurement based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a method to unfold @xmath20 in the non  perturbative range .    in summary , we found that the @xmath3 corrections , supplemented by the soft exponentiation , for the neutral and charged current deep inelastic @xmath4 scattering cross sections amount to @xmath100 for the cases of jet measurement , mixed variables , and the double angle method .",
    "these contributions are of the order of the difference between the complete @xmath9 and the leading log result @xmath11 . in the case of the measurement based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , contributions from the non  perturbative range @xmath30 influence both the 1st and 2nd order corrections .",
