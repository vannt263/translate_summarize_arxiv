    "ab - stacked bilayer graphene ( blg ) @xcite is formed by two graphene @xcite layers rotated by 60@xmath0 with respect to each other .",
    "its low - energy band structure is characterized by parabolic conduction and valence bands that touch at the corners , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points , of the brillouin zone .",
    "a number of theoretical works have predicted various spontaneously - broken - symmetry states as the candidates for the ground state of blg near the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) in the absence of external fields .",
    "@xcite the multiple degrees of freedom in blg  layer , spin , and valley",
    " give rise to the diversity of the candidate orders .",
    "in general , the proposed ordered states can be classified in two groups : ( i ) gapped states characterized by the opening of a full gap in the quasiparticle spectrum , and ( ii ) nematic states in which the quadratic band crossing points at which the conduction and valence bands touch are split into two dirac points leaving the quasiparticle spectrum gapless .",
    "these two groups have a different structure with respect to the layer index : gapped states are layer - polarized while nematic states are not.@xcite depending on the valley and spin structure different collective states can be identified in each general group .",
    "gapped states with different spin - valley structures include the quantum valley hall ( qvh ) , the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) and the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state , as well as a layer antiferromagnet ( laf ) state . within mean field theory , in the clean limit",
    ", the states in each group have the same transition temperature , @xmath3 for the gapped states , and @xmath4 for the nematic states .",
    "several experimental groups have made efforts to ascertain the nature of the ground state using high - quality suspended blg.@xcite they all find evidence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at low temperatures .",
    "however , they reach different conclusions on the identity of the ordered state : first , some experiments show evidence that supports the establishment of a nematic state,@xcite while others either present results that are more consistent with the establishment of a gapped state @xcite or are consistent with both type of states @xcite ; second , among the experiments supporting the establishment of a gapped state , some indicate that the gapped state comes with conducting edge states @xcite and others indicate that the state is fully insulating @xcite e.g. the laf state .",
    "one explanation that has been proposed for this multitude of conflicting experimental results is that blg is highly multi critical,@xcite and that different experimental samples fall in the basin of attraction of different correlated fixed points .",
    "one important and unavoidable factor present in all materials that has the potential to strongly affect the formation and nature of a broken symmetry state is disorder , due , for instance , to charge impurities , adatoms , vacancies , and ripples .",
    "for example , it is well known that the presence of magnetic impurities in bcs superconductors can strongly decrease the transition temperature ( @xmath5).@xcite the pair - breaking effect of magnetic impurities in bcs superconductors can be attributed to the different scattering off the impurities of the time - reversed fermionic states forming the cooper pairs .",
    "another example is the pair - breaking effect of normal impurities on exciton condensates.@xcite since the broken - symmetry states in blg involve particle - hole pairing with different layer - spin - valley structures , we expect that different pairing structures could be affected differently by disorder .    in this work , we study the effect of disorder on the broken - symmetry states of blg near the cnp in the absence of external fields .",
    "we consider only non - magnetic disorder and do not take into account spin flip scattering . within mean field theory , in the clean limit , the transition temperature of the gapped phase is higher than that of the nematic phase .",
    "however , we find that this scenario can be modified when the presence of disorder is taken into account .",
    "considering non - magnetic short - range disorder , we find that in the presence of disorder that causes intra valley scattering only , the transition temperature of the gapped states is suppressed more than the transition temperature of the nematic states . thus , within mean field theory , our results indicate that below a critical strength of disorder the system is prone to be in a gapped phase whereas above the critical disorder strength the nematic phase is favored , as shown in fig.[fig : transition ] . in addition , we find that non - magnetic disorder producing inter valley scattering also contributes to the suppression of @xmath5 for the valley - unpolarized gapped states but does not affect @xmath5 for the valley - polarized gapped states .",
    "since valley - polarized gapped states have co - propagating edge modes in the two valleys ( which can not be gapped out in the absence of magnetic disorder ) , while valley - unpolarized gapped states have counter propagating edge modes ( which can be gapped out in the presence of inter valley scattering ) , our results on the effect of inter valley disorder could also be part of the explanation of why some experiments see conducting states with a bulk gap while others see insulating gapped states .     for the gapped phase and @xmath6 for the nematic phase under three interlayer disorder correlation conditions ,",

    "[ . in this work",
    "the authors investigate twenty - three high - quality suspended blg devices and find that these samples , at low temperatures ( @xmath138 k ) and zero external fields , fall into two groups : sixteen samples have a minimum conductivity of the order of @xmath139 , whereas seven samples are practically insulating with conductivity @xmath140 . at the same time , the seven insulating samples are among the highest room - temperature mobility samples , indicating a lower disorder strength in the insulating samples .",
    "notice that the value of the minimum conductivity ( @xmath139 ) reported in ref .",
    "[ for the sixteen samples with lower mobility ( @xmath141 ) is quite smaller than the value of minimum conductivity expected for samples of this quality in the normal ( non ordered ) state of blg.@xcite it is then natural to expect that these sixteen samples , at low temperature , might be in a nematic or a gapped valley - polarized state and not in the normal state .",
    "it is a possiblel scenario to interpret the results presented in ref .  [ as suggesting that the cleanest samples are in a valley - independent gapped state that has no protected edge currents ( insulating ) and that the samples with lower mobility , higher disorder strength , are either in the nematic gapless phase or in a gapped valley - polarized state that has protected edge currents .",
    "this interpretation of the measurements of these comparative experimental studies is qualitatively consistent with our results that show that as the strength of the non - magnetic disorder increases the valley - independent gapped states get suppressed more strongly and the nematic or the gapped valley - polarized states become favored .",
    "in addition , in the experiments presented in ref .",
    "[ it is estimated that the density of charge impurities in the sample that exhibits signatures of a broken symmetry phase , is on the order of @xmath142 .",
    "this order of impurity density is consistent with our results given that it is lower than the value that we obtain , eq.([eq : nimpc ] , [ eq : nematic_nimpc ] ) , for the critical charge impurity density , above which @xmath143 , for both the gapped and the nematic phase , considering that in the clean limit @xmath5 is on the order of few mev .",
    "the discussion above indicates that the effect of disorder described in our work should be directly relevant to current experiments on blg , with some limitations .",
    "the experimental results presented in ref .  [ clearly show that disorder plays an important role in determining the nature of the broken - symmetry state in blg .",
    "our work provides an insight on how non - magnetic disorder might resolve the competition between different ordered states .",
    "given the difficulty of probing experimentally the nature of the ordered phase , the strength of the disorder , and in particular the relative strength of inter valley and intra valley disorder , more work is needed to fully characterize the effect of the interplay between electron correlations and disorder in blg .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the effect of non - magnetic disorder on the nature of bilayer graphene broken symmetry state that is expected to be established when the chemical potential is set at the charge neutrality point even in the absence of external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "current experiments have shown signatures suggesting that the broken symmetry state could be either in a gapped phase or in a nematic gapless phase .",
    "for this reason we focused our analysis only on these two groups of ordered states , even though it has been shown theoretically that many other competing ordered states are possible .",
    "@xcite    we find that in the presence of intra valley disorder , the resulting pair - breaking effects have different magnitude in the gapped and in the nematic phase : the transition temperature is suppressed more strongly in the gapped phase than in the nematic phase .",
    "moreover , we find that in the nematic phase the pair - breaking effect of the disorder depends significantly on the interlayer correlation properties of the disorder : the pair - breaking effect is weaker in the uncorrelated case than in the perfectly correlated case , and it is the weakest for the case of perfectly anticorrelated disorder .",
    "we also find that the presence of inter valley disorder enhances the pair - breaking effect of disorder on the valley - independent gapped states but that it merely contributes a non pair - breaking component to the valley - polarized gapped states .",
    "our results suggest that clean blg might have a valley - independent gapped ground state ( e.g. laf ) , which does not have protected edge modes , but that small amounts of inter valley disorder can drive it into a valley - polarized gapped state with edge modes ( e.g. qah or qsh ) , and that intra valley disorder can drive it into a nematic state .",
    "the relation of our results to the current available experiments has been discussed .",
    "in addition , assuming charge impurities to be the dominant source of disorder , we provide a quantitative estimate of the critical impurity densities above which the gapped and the nematic order vanish , which can be tested in experiments .",
