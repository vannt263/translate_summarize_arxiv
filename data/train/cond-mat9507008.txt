    "in recent years the physics of strongly correlated fermi systems has attracted wide interest , in particular in the context of high @xmath3 superconductors @xcite and their normal state properties @xcite . despite intense efforts , systematic and controlled theoretical methods for dealing with such systems are still lacking . at the heart of the problem",
    "is the effect of a strong on  site coulomb repulsion @xmath4 on fermions living on a lattice , in particular in @xmath5 dimensions . at low energy",
    "such models can be mapped onto effective hamiltonians with the constraint of no double occupancy of any lattice sites .",
    "the projection onto the corresponding subspace of hilbert space is presumably responsible for a number of unusual properties , most remarkably the spin  charge separation and non  fermi liquid behaviour .",
    "unfortunately the local constraints on the site occupancy are difficult to handle .",
    "one possible formulation @xcite uses auxiliary particles such as slave - bosons ( @xmath6 ) and pseudo - fermions ( @xmath7 ) to represent an electron as a composite particle consisting of a pseudo - fermion particle and a slave - boson hole ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the local constraint is holonomic in this formulation , and is given by the condition that the sum of the occupation numbers of pseudo - fermions and slave - bosons is equal to unity at any lattice site , @xmath9 .",
    "the constraint is closely related to the local gauge symmetry of the system with respect to simultaneous @xmath10 gauge transformations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it may be shown that starting with certain mean field theories the constraint and its consequences lead to the appearance of longitudinal and transverse fictitious gauge fields coupling equally to pseudo - fermions and slave - bosons@xcite .",
    "the gauge fields restore the local symmetry broken in mean field theory .    however , it is not clear that the slave - boson mean field theories are a good starting point ( except for the cases where a physical phase transition into a magnetic or superconducting phase takes place ) .",
    "alternatively one may guarantee the local gauge invariance of approximations by deriving those from a generating functional @xcite .",
    "the local gauge invariance ensures conservation of the local occupation at each lattice site ( the `` local charge '' ) in time . in order to effect the actual projection , it is still necessary to fix the occupation numbers at a given time locally .",
    "so far this has only been achieved for impurity models , e.g. the anderson model of a magnetic impurity in a metallic host @xcite .    even if the projection is done exactly , an equally important question is the selection of the dominating contributions in perturbation theory in the hybridization ( or in the hopping integrals and exchange interaction in the case of lattice models ) . in this paper",
    "we address this question for the infinite u anderson impurity model ( degeneracy @xmath11 ) .",
    "we employ the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) to calculate the slave - boson and pseudo - fermion spectral functions and compare the results with those of the simplest fully projected conserving approximation , the so called `` non  crossing approximation '' ( nca ) @xcite . while the nca is known to give excellent results for large degeneracy @xmath12 and not too low temperatures , including the cross  over from low ( @xmath13 ) to high temperature ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kondo temperature)@xcite , pronounced deviations from exactly known results appear at @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the comparisons will allow us to pinpoint the deficiencies of the nca and to identify possible improvements .    in earlier publications @xcite",
    "we have presented results of an nrg calculation of the slave  boson and pseudo  fermion spectral functions at zero temperature .",
    "we found these functions to be infrared divergent at threshold , with critical exponents dependent on the d - level occupancy @xmath16 and given by simple expressions identical to the well known x  ray absorption threshold exponents .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we formulate the model , describe how we implement the numerical renormalization group for studying auxiliary spectral functions of this model and describe the nca within the framework of conserving approximations .",
    "section iii describes our results for spectral functions calculated with the above two methods . in section",
    "iv we summarize our main results .",
    "some details of the auxiliary particle technique , which make it suitable for an effective evaluation at the lowest temperatures , are discussed in the appendices .",
    "the anderson model of an impurity @xmath17 electron state hybridizing with the conduction band with infinitely strong coulomb repulsion in the d  level in auxiliary particle representation takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the conduction electron kinetic energy and @xmath20 annihilates a conduction electron with spin @xmath21 at the impurity site @xmath22 .",
    "the hilbert space consists of disjoint subspaces characterized by the conserved auxiliary particle number @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the physical subspace is defined by the constraint @xmath25 . following wilson @xcite we ( i )",
    "linearize the spectrum of @xmath26 about the fermi energy @xmath27 , ( ii ) introduce a logarithmic mesh of k points @xmath28 and ( iii ) perform a unitary transformation of the @xmath29 such that @xmath30 is the first operator in the new basis and @xmath31 takes the form of a tight  binding hamiltonian in k  space , @xmath32 with @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "these steps are explained in detail in @xcite and can be taken over for the present model without change .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : am ] ) together with the discretized form of the kinetic energy ( [ eq : tight - binding ] ) in the new basis is now diagonalized by the following iterative process : ( i ) one defines a sequence of finite size hamiltonians @xmath35 by replacing @xmath31 in ( [ eq : tight - binding ] ) by @xmath36 ( ii ) starting from @xmath37 , each successive hopping may be considered as a perturbation on the previous hamiltonian ; ( iii ) the hamiltonians @xmath35 are scaled such that the energy spacing remains the same .",
    "this defines a renormalization group transformation @xmath38 , with @xmath39 chosen so that the ground state energy of @xmath40 is zero .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath41 are diagonalized within subspaces of well defined @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total fermion number , @xmath44 the total spin and @xmath45 the z  component of total spin .",
    "the use of these conserved quantities leads to significant reductions in the size of matrices to be diagonalized , however the dimension of @xmath41 grows as @xmath46 and it is necessary to truncate the higher energy states for @xmath47 .",
    "approximately @xmath48 of the states generated at each iteration are retained in the calculations and this constitutes a surprisingly accurate approximation for the present model .",
    "this accuracy is evidenced by the fact that various exact relations , such as the friedel sum rule , which relates the impurity spectral density at the fermi level to the local level occupancy , are satisfied to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the number of states retained per iteration , @xmath49 , which is a free parameter , can be varied from 250 to 2000 states without any significant change in the results presented here .",
    "this , together with the almost cut  off independent results for @xmath50 indicates the convergence and accuracy of the method .      within the framework of the nrg it is natural to represent the green functions in an eigenbasis of the hamiltonian . in the enlarged hilbert space",
    "the retarded propagators for pseudo  fermions and slave  bosons are defined by @xmath51 where , for each @xmath52 , @xmath53 are eigenvalues of the subspaces @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the grand ",
    "canonical partition function , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 are the many  body matrix elements for pseudo  fermions and slave  bosons , respectively .",
    "the constrained propagators are then obtained as @xmath59 where the frequency has been shifted as @xmath60 .",

    "similarly , in the expression for @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the groundstate of the interacting system ( @xmath25 subspace ) and @xmath82 are the excited states of the non  interacting conduction electron system , @xmath83 and @xmath84 the corresponding energy eigenvalues .",
    "these spectral functions vanish _ above _ the threshold energy @xmath85 . from ( [ eq : sum - rule1]-[eq : sum - rule2 ] ) and ( [ eq : aplus0 ] )",
    "we see that the @xmath86 spectral functions @xmath87 satisfy the sum rule @xmath88    in practice , within the nrg technique , it is the excitation energies from the respective @xmath74 or @xmath25 groundstates which are calculated . hence , it is convenient to set the threshold energy , @xmath85 , to zero .",
    "the @xmath86 projected auxiliary spectral functions then have divergences at zero energy .",
    "as described in appendix  d it is also possible to formulate the nca equations of section c such that the nca spectral functions exhibit their @xmath86 divergences at zero energy .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath93 of the pseudo - particle operators @xmath94 , @xmath95 in ( [ eq : aplus][eq : aminus ] ) are calculated recursively using the formulae given in appendix  a. similar formulae apply to the matrix elements @xmath96 for the physical @xmath17 electron green s function . for each iteration step",
    ", they are substituted together with the energy eigenvalues into ( [ eq : aplus0][eq : aminus0 ] ) to give the @xmath86 spectral functions @xmath97 . in principle",

    "there is an exact relation between the d - electron green s function and @xmath120 : @xmath121 thus , the principal problem remaining in the evaluation of the theory is the proper choice of approximation in which the three self - energies are calculated .",
    "the slave  boson hamiltonian ( [ eq : am ] ) is invariant under two independent @xmath10 gauge transformations : ( 1 ) simultaneous transformation of the pseudo  fermion and the slave  boson operators and ( 2 ) simultaneous transformation of the pseudo  fermion and the conduction electron operators .",

    "there is good agreement between @xmath225 , @xmath216 and @xmath223 for the high energy parts of the renormalized resonant level @xmath231 , but the incorrect low energy behaviour of the nca result for @xmath66 in the above regimes and the neglect of the vertex part in ( [ eq : nca - convolution ] ) and ( [ eq : nrg - convolution ] ) makes both @xmath223 and @xmath216 deviate from the exact nrg result at low energies .",
    "the resonant level is approximately a lorentzian of width @xmath157 , and the small asymmetric broadening in the nrg curves is due to the logarithmic discretization .",
    "an improved description of high energies could be obtained in both nrg and nca , if required . within nrg",

    "the exact result at @xmath237 is given by the friedel sum rule , @xmath229 , so we conclude that the vertex corrections neglected in ( [ eq : singularity ] ) are singular at low energies , i.e. close to the threshold , and lead to a singularity in @xmath238 at the fermi level which cancels that in ( [ eq : singularity ] ) .",
    "similar vertex corrections appear in the calculation of other physical quantities such as the dynamic spin susceptibility .",
    "in this paper we have made a comparison of the spectral functions of the @xmath0 anderson model as calculated within the simplest self  consistent conserving approximation , the nca , and within the nrg . at high energies",
    "@xmath239 we found good quantitative agreement for the auxiliary and physical spectral functions calculated within the two methods in all parameter regimes .",
    "some small discrepancies in the shape of high energy peaks could be attributed to the logarithmic discretization used in the nrg which tends to give lower resolution and slight asymmetries to high energy peaks . at lower energies we found good quantitative agreement for both slave  boson and pseudo  fermion spectral functions down to at least @xmath1 . in the kondo regime",
    "the agreement between the nca and nrg slave  boson spectral function @xmath66 extended to well below the low energy scale @xmath240 . despite the accuracy of the nca auxiliary spectral functions down to @xmath15 we noted that the impurity spectral density deviated from the essentially exact nrg result on energy scales up to @xmath241 .",
    "the source of this discrepancy was traced directly to the lack of the vertex part in the nca expression for the impurity spectral density , thus showing that vertex corrections are required for the physical green s functions even when the auxiliary particle dynamics appears to be correctly described within the nca ( for energies down to @xmath1 ) . in the fermi liquid regime @xmath234",

    "this is the main conclusion of the comparisons we made .",
    "we are in the process of including vertex corrections within a self  consistent theory @xcite , thus going beyond the lowest order conserving approximation .",
    "the availability of accurate results for dynamic properties via the nrg for impurity models makes the latter a natural testing ground for developing such approximation schemes .",

    "in order to effect the constraint of the dynamics to the physical hilbert subspace it is convenient to add the term @xmath279 to the hamiltonian , where @xmath280 is a `` chemical potential '' associated with the auxiliary particle number @xmath52 .",

    "second , the canonical @xmath25 expectation value of any operator @xmath281 having a zero expectation value in the @xmath74 subspace is given by , @xmath288    thus , we obtain the constrained @xmath17electron green function in terms of the grand ",

    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gd ] ) that the operator constraint @xmath25 is imposed on the auxiliary green s functions by simply taking the limit @xmath283 of the respective unconstrained functions .",
    "clearly , by this procedure all excitation energies of pseudo  fermions and slave bosons are shifted to @xmath292 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to re  define the auxiliary particle frequency scale as @xmath113 before taking the limit @xmath283 .",
    "note that this does not affect the energy scale of physical quantities ( like the local @xmath17 electron green s function ) , which is the _ difference _ between the the pseudo  fermion and the slave  boson energy .",
    "in order to enter the asymptotic power law regime of the auxiliary spectral functions and to compare with the t=0 results of the nrg , the nca must be evaluated for temperatures several orders of magnitude below @xmath154 , the low temperature scale of the model .",
    "the equations are solved numerically by iteration . in this appendix",
    "the two main procedures are described to make the diagrammatic auxiliary particle technique suitable for the lowest temperatures .",
    "where @xmath296 , @xmath297 denote the fermi and bose functions . substituting this into the expression ( [ eq : zcan ] ) for the canonical partition function we obtain after carrying out the transformation @xmath298 , and taking the limit @xmath299 @xmath300 , \\label{eq : qproj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath301 are now the projected spectral functions as defined in eq .",

    "therefore , we apply the following transformations :    \\(1 ) before performing the projection @xmath308 , @xmath114 we re  define the frequency scale of all auxiliary particle functions @xmath293 according to @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is a finite parameter . in each iteration @xmath311",

    "( [ eq : qproj ] ) that @xmath314 , i.e. @xmath310 is the chemical potential for the auxiliary particle number @xmath52 , or equivalently the impurity contribution to the free energy .",
    "the difference of the free energies becomes equal to the threshold energy @xmath315 at @xmath86 , so the energy scale of the shifted spectral functions defined above coincides exactly with that of the nrg spectral functions defined in ( [ eq : aplus ] ) .",
    "more importantly , however , the above way of determining a `` threshold '' is less ad hoc than , for example , defining it by a maximum in some function appearing in the nca equations .",
    "it is also seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fixl ] ) that this procedure defines the frequency scale of the auxiliary particles such that the @xmath86 threshold divergence of the spectral functions is at the _ fixed _",
    "frequency @xmath316 .",
    "this substantially increases the precision as well as the speed of numerical evaluations .",
    "( [ eq : gd ] ) for the projected @xmath17 electron green s function becomes @xmath317    \\(2 ) the divergence of the boltzmann factors implies that the self  consistent solutions for @xmath318 vanish exponentially @xmath319 for negative frequencies .",
    "it is convenient , not to formulate the self ",
    "consistent equations in terms of @xmath293 like in earlier evaluations @xcite , but to define new functions @xmath320 and @xmath321 such that @xmath322 after fixing the chemical potential @xmath311 and performing the projection onto the physical subspace , the canonical partition function ( eq .  ( [ eq : zcan ] ) ) behaves as @xmath323 , and it follows immediately from the definition of @xmath166 that @xmath324 in this way all exponential divergencies are absorbed by one single function for each particle species . the nca equations in terms of these functions are free of divergencies of the statistical factors and read @xmath325 = 1\\\\ \\mbox{im}g_{d\\sigma}(\\omega -i0,t ) & = &   \\int \\mbox{d}\\epsilon [ f(\\epsilon + \\omega)f(-\\epsilon ) + f(-\\epsilon -\\omega)f(\\epsilon ) ] \\tilde a_{f\\sigma}(\\epsilon + \\omega)\\tilde a_b(\\epsilon),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the real parts of the self ",
