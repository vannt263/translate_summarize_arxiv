    "the theory of elasticity with moving source have a range of important applications .",
    "they are linked with the developing of more high - speed transport and with the necessity to evaluate the influence of elastic waves from moving objects on different constructions .",
    "the theoretical side of these problems is also of interest .",
    "the changes in the character of mechanical fields is essentially depend on the behavior of source motion and are caused by the type of differential equations ranging from elliptical to hyperbolic .    from the steady - state problems with moving sources the problems with moving and oscillating sources are the most complicated .",
    "we use the following terminology .",
    "if the source is moving with constant velocity @xmath0 and simultaneously oscillating with frequency @xmath1 , we consider the problem @xmath2 , while in the case @xmath3 , we have the classical harmonic problems with oscillating source and so refer them to the problem @xmath4 .    nowadays considerable progress",
    "is obtained in the investigation of the problem @xmath2 .",

    ".    it is evident , that for anisotropic elastic media the particular problems @xmath2 are not studied sufficiently . in [ 7 ] the plane waves and fundamental solutions for problem @xmath2 for tree - dimensional anisotropic media are studied , and in [ 8 ] the approaches for the problem @xmath2 for anisotropic elastic and piezoelectric waveguides are proposed .    in present paper",
    "we investigate the properties of plane waves and fundamental solutions in the problem @xmath2 for anisotropic elastic plane .",
    "it is well - known , that for many classes of anisotropic materials it is possible to formulate the problems @xmath4 and @xmath2 in conditions of plane deformation . for existence of the plane problem",
    "several elastic modules must be equal to zero .",
    "thus , for the plane deformation in the plane @xmath5 for elastic modules in two - index notation we require that @xmath6 , for the plane deformation in the plane @xmath7 @xmath8 , and for the plane deformation in the plane @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the vectors of external force in the plane deformation problems must not have non - zero components in the perpendicular direction and must not depend on perpendicular to plane coordinate .",
    "we assume that all above - mentioned conditions are implemented . to be more concrete , let us accept that the plane deformation is realized in plane @xmath7 , and therefore the vector of mechanic displacement has non - zero components @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for harmonic vibrations with frequency @xmath1 we shall find the established solution in the form @xmath15    in the problem with moving sources we consider two coordinate systems .",
    "let @xmath16 be fixed coordinate system with time @xmath17 , and let @xmath18 be coordinate system , which is moving relatively to fixed system with constant velocity @xmath19 .",
    "we denote @xmath20 the time in moving coordinate system .",
    "the two coordinate systems are connected with each other by the following relations @xmath21    for the problem @xmath2 we propose that in moving coordinate system the harmonic behavior ( 1.1 ) with frequency @xmath1 is existed .    for the equations of theory of elasticity in moving coordinate system we use the following relations from ( 1.2 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "then the stain vector @xmath25 ( @xmath26 are the components of strain tensor ) may be expressed from the displacement vector as @xmath27 where @xmath28    from hook s low for anisotropic media for the plane deformation in the plane ( @xmath29 ) we have the relation between the stress vector @xmath30 ( @xmath31 are the components of stress tensor ) and the strain vector @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34    we suppose here @xmath35 is not depended on coordinate , i.e. the medium material is homogeneous .    by using ( 1.3 ) and the previous notations the equations for elastic medium in the case of plane deformation may be written in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the density ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 is the body force , @xmath40 is the conjugation operator .    by using ( 1.4)(1.6 ) the equation ( 1.8 )",
    "may be rewritten @xmath41    this equation together with the ( 1.1 ) is the equation for amplitude * v*.    we study the properties of plane wave in problem @xmath2 at first , to determine the fundamental solution .",
    "we find the solution of equations ( 1.9 ) without body force ( @xmath42 ) in the form of plane waves @xmath43 , \\eqno(2.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the amplitude , @xmath44 is the unit polarization vector ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 is the wave vector ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the unit wave normal vector ) .    by substituting ( 2.1 ) into ( 1.9 ) yields the eigenvalue problem @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the phase velocity in the problem @xmath2 , @xmath54 is the acoustic christoffel s tensor ( matrix ) .",
    "as it follows from common properties of the problem @xmath4 in 3d [ 9 , 10 ] , here in the problem @xmath4 in 2d two plane waves with phase velocities @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and with polarization vector ( eigenvector ) @xmath58 exist for arbitrary direction @xmath49,which can be selected orthonormalized . for the problem @xmath2 , as it is obvious from ( 2.2 ) , the situation is more complicated . particularly , for the direct plane waves ( @xmath59 ) in the problem @xmath2 with fixed @xmath49 and @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63    thus , in condition ( 2.4 ) for fixed @xmath49 and @xmath64 we have one plane wave , in condition ( 2.5 ) we have two ( one  @xmath65  fast , other  @xmath66  slow ) , and in condition ( 2.6 ) the direct plane waves are absent . the polarization vectors @xmath58 of plane waves in the problems @xmath4 and @xmath2 are identical , with the exception of the case ( 2.6 ) , besides in the case ( 2.5 ) both fast and slow waves have the same polarization vector .",
    "henceforth we denote the phase velocity in the cases ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.5 ) by uniform way : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , i.e. for the case ( 2.4 ) @xmath69 .",
    "if for @xmath70 , @xmath71 the condition ( 2.4 ) is realized , then we shall call subseismic the motion behavior , and otherwise  trans- or superseismic . the difference between that notions we shall mark below .",
    "we introduce the phase velocity vector @xmath72 and the inverse velocity vector @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75    by analogy with problem @xmath4 , we shall also call the vector @xmath73 refraction vector or slowness vector .    the dispersion equation in the problem @xmath2 for plane wave ( 2.1 )",
    "have the following form @xmath76 = 0 , \\eqno(2.9)\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the unit matrix 2x2 , @xmath78    the solution of equation ( 2.10 ) can be leaved in the form of the set of hypersurfaces @xmath79    from the dispersion surface ( 2.11 ) the group velocity vector @xmath80 may be found by the following way @xmath81 or , by using ( 2.7 ) , @xmath82    it is known [ 10 ] , that for plane waves in the problem @xmath4 these important relations are correct ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84    as it is shown in [ 7 ] for the case of tree - dimensional problem , the analogical formulae are valid .",
    "this proof is completely transported on the considered plane problem",
    ". therefore the following relations are correct @xmath85 ( in ( 2.14 ) and in the next the summation by repeating index is absent . )    after analyzing obtained formulae ( 2.14 ) , we may establish for the problem @xmath2 the basic properties of phase velocity curves @xmath86 , slowness curves ( inverse velocity or reflection curves ) @xmath87 and group velocity curves ( waves curves or ray curves ) @xmath88 .",
    "in general , all of these curves in the problem @xmath2 with @xmath89 do not have the central symmetry @xmath90 , and their crystallographical symmetry does not reserve .",
    "the phase velocity curves @xmath72 and waves curves @xmath91 are limited for all values @xmath92 .",
    "but the slowness curves @xmath73 can be both limited and unlimited depending on motion behavior .",
    "we shall call the source motion rate superseismic , if in @xmath93 the directions @xmath49 , along which there are no slowness curves , exist , and all slowness curves are unlimited .",
    "if there is one limited slowness curve , but also unlimited slowness curves exist , then we shall call this motion behavior transseismic .",
    "we note that the slowness curves @xmath73 may essentially differ from corresponding curves for the problem @xmath4 , and their number may vary from 2 to 4 . at the same time , the group velocity curves @xmath91 for the problem @xmath2 may be obtained by simple transfer of curves for the problem @xmath4 by vector @xmath94 . besides , with trans- and superseismic motion rate two parts @xmath95 and @xmath96 form one closed curve .",
    "for this behavior in case ( 2.5 ) for fixed @xmath49 and @xmath64 we have two plane waves ( fast and slow ) with inverse velocities , which belong to two different slowness curves .",
    "in addition to this from ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.14 ) important common properties follow [ 7 ] .",
    "thus , the quasi - longitudinal and quasi - shear curves save their types for all @xmath0 , because the polarization vector @xmath58 from ( 2.2 ) does not depend on the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the group velocity vector @xmath97 , by ( 2.14 ) in every point of slowness curve @xmath98 , is orthogonal to the tangent to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "conversely , the wave normal vector @xmath49 of plane wave with group velocity @xmath101 is orthogonal to tangent in the corresponding point of wave velocity @xmath97 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "everything considered above is illustrated by figs .",
    "these figures show slowness and group velocities curves for different kinds of quartz for plane deformations in planes @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "curves marked with `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' correspond to waves with phase velocities @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "the waves are numbered so that for the problem @xmath4 @xmath107 . therefore in the most cases waves with subscript `` 1 '' will be quasi - shear and waves with subscript `` 2 '' will be quasi - longitudinal .",
    "the figures 16 show characteristic curves of plane waves for fused silica ( @xmath108 ) , which is isotropic material .",
    "the elasticity modules and density of fused silica as well as other materials were taken from [ 9 ] .",
    "the figures 1 and 2 show curves of slowness and group velocities of fused silica without motion ( @xmath109 ) respectively . as it can be seen from fig .  1 and 2 when @xmath109 these curves represent couples of concentric circumferences .",

    "<S> in present article we consider the problems of concentrated point force which is moving with constant velocity and oscillating with cyclic frequency in unbounded homogeneous anisotropic elastic two - dimensional medium . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of plane waves and their phase , slowness and ray or group velocity curves for 2d problem in moving coordinate system are described . by using the fourier integral transform techniques and established the properties of the plane waves , the explicit representation of the elastodynamic green s tensor </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for all types of source motion as a sum of the integrals over the finite interval . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic components of the green s tensor are extracted .    </S>",
    "<S> the stationary phase method is applied to derive an asymptotic approximation of the far wave field . </S>",
    "<S> the simple formulae for poynting energy flux vectors for moving and fixed observers are presented too . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that in the far zones the cylindrical waves are separated under kinematics and energy .    </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the motion bring some differences in the far field properties . </S>",
    "<S> they are modification of the wave propagation zones and their number , fast and slow waves appearance under trans- and superseismic motion and so on . </S>"
