    "the gini coefficient plays a crucial role in measuring poverty or inequality and can be a basis of political decision - making . although it is ideal to utilise individual household data to estimate the gini coefficient accurately ( see , ,",
    "hasegawa and kozumi  2003 ) , availability of individual data is usually severely limited because of the difficulty in data collection and management and confidentiality of , say , individual income data , the former being particularly true in developing countries . instead , grouped data , which provide the summary of income for several income classes , are widely available . estimating the gini coefficient based on grouped data has drawn substantial attention from both the theoretical and empirical perspectives .",
    "see , for example , chotikapanich  ( 2008 ) for an overview .",
    "there are mainly two approaches to estimate the gini coefficient from grouped income data in the parametric framework ( ryu and slottje  1999 ) .",
    "one is to assume a hypothetical statistical distribution for income and estimate the parameter of the distribution ( mcdonald and xu  1995 ) .",
    "the gini coefficient is then calculated from the estimates .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it provides a straightforward interpretation about the underlying income distribution because the moments can be computed and the shape of the distribution can be visualised through the parameter estimates obtained",
    ". there exists a wide range of size distributions ( kleiber and kotz  2003 ) and the likelihood function can be constructed based on the multinomial distribution ( mcdonald  1984 ) or selected order statistics ( nishino and kakamu  2011 ) .",
    "the other approach is to fit a specific functional form to the lorenz curve and estimate the parameters of the function .",
    "since such a functional form for the lorenz curve is designed so that the inequality measures can be easily derived , the gini coefficient is immediately calculated once the parameter estimates are obtained .",
    "a notable advantage of this approach is that a large list of functional forms is available ( see , , kakwani and podder  1973 ; basmann .",
    "1986 ; 1990 ; ortega  .  1991 ; rasche  .  1980",
    "; villaseor and arnold  1989 ; chotikapanich  1993 ; sarabia  .",
    "1999 ) in addition to the ones that are derived from the well - known income models such as the lognormal , singh - maddala , and dagum distributions .",
    "however , while the implied probability density function exists provided some conditions are satisfied ( iritani and kuga  1983 and sarabia  2008 ) , the interpretation as a statistical size distribution is less intuitive as the support of the probability density function of the implied distribution is limited to some interval .    given this context , the aim of the current paper is to combine the two approaches and estimate the lorenz curve of a hypothetical statistical distribution from the grouped data .",
    "the advantage of the two approaches can be exploited in such a way that the gini coefficient is estimated accurately and an intuitive interpretation of the underlying income distribution is obtained .",
    "it is worth noting that the approach proposed by chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 , 2005 ) motivates the present study and is related to ours in the sense that both approaches are the inverse of that of aigner and goldberge  ( 1970 ) , where the likelihood function was constructed based on the population shares but not on the income shares . in chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 , 2005 ) ,",
    "the expectation of the income shares for the groups , and hence that of the differences between the lorenz curves for the consecutive groups , is assumed to be equal to the population shares for the corresponding groups .",
    "then , they adopted the pseudo - likelihood function based on the dirichlet distribution and proposed the maximum likelihood estimator and bayes estimator by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "although their dirichlet likelihood approach may be convenient , the parameter estimates and the resulting gini estimate can be highly sensitive with respective to the additional parameter , which is required to construct the dirichlet likelihood . in the bayesian framework , the posterior distributions of the parameters and gini coefficient are sensitive with respect to the prior distribution of this parameter .",
    "the sensitivity is especially profound when the number of groups is small .",
    "furthermore , the evaluation of the likelihood function requires the evaluation of the lorenz curve for each group .",
    "the applicability of this method is limited to cases where evaluation of the lorenz curve derived from the hypothetical distribution is feasible or where the lorenz curve satisfies some desirable assumptions .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to work on the likelihood function implied from the lorenz curve of the hypothetical income distribution , instead of working on the dirichlet likelihood .",
    "another advantage of the proposed approach in addition to the ones mentioned above is that we do not require the additional parameter as in chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "however , since the transformation of the individual household incomes constitutes the likelihood function for the lorenz curve from the group data , the likelihood function is defined implicitly and can not be evaluated directly . in other words ,",
    "only the statistics of the underlying independently and identically distributed random variables are observed but the distribution of the statistics is not analytically available .",
    "therefore , the standard maximum likelihood and mcmc methods can not be applied .",
    "we employ the approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) method that avoids the direct evaluation of the likelihood function and simulate data from the model , given a candidate parameter value .",
    "if the simulated and observed data are similar , the candidate parameter value is a good candidate to generate the observed data ( sisson and fan  2011 ) .",
    "then , it can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution .",
    "the abc method has a wide variety of fields of application including population genetics , population biology , signal processing , epidemiology , and economics .",
    "see , for example , csillry .",
    "( 2010 ) , sisson and fan  ( 2011 ) , and marin  .",
    "( 2012 ) for an overview of the abc methods .",
    "the application of the abc method requires an ability to simulate datasets from the probability model and is well - suited to the present context , because datasets can be easily generated from the hypothetical income distribution .",
    "since it is difficult to devise an efficient proposal distribution for an mcmc algorithm in the abc setting , we adopt the sequential monte carlo ( smc ) algorithm with adaptive weights proposed by bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) , which is computationally efficient and easy to implement .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sec2 ] briefly reviews the estimation methods for the lorenz curve from grouped data and proposes our estimation method based on abc .",
    "further , the five - parameter generalised beta distribution is adopted as a flexible hypothetical income distribution .",
    "section  [ sec : ne ] illustrates the proposed method by using the simulated data and compares the performance with the existing methods .",
    "the application of the proposed method to the real data from the family income and expenditure survey in japan is also presented . finally , section  [ sec : conc ] concludes and some remaining issues are discussed .",
    "suppose that the population is divided into @xmath0 groups .",
    "let us denote the observed cumulative share of households and income by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which are usually constructed from a survey on @xmath3 individual households .",
    "even if the cumulative share of households and cumulative share of income are not directly available , the income classes , class income means , and number of households are reported in the grouped data , from which @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be calculated .",
    "let us denote the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the hypothetical income distribution with the parameter @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then , the lorenz curve denoted by @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mean of the distribution and @xmath12 .",
    "once the parameter estimate for @xmath6 is obtained , the gini coefficient can be estimated by using @xmath13 there are several methods to estimate the parameters of the lorenz curves , for example , the least squares ( kakwani and podder  1973 ) or generalised least squares ( kakwani and podder  1976 ) .",
    "more recently , chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 ) proposed a maximum likelihood estimator based on the pseudo - likelihood from the dirichlet distribution given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the income share for the @xmath17-th group , @xmath18 is the gamma function , and @xmath19 is the additional parameter of the dirichlet likelihood .",
    "this likelihood function is motivated by the assumption given by @xmath20 = l(p_{j}|{\\text{\\boldmath{$\\theta$}}})-l(p_{j-1}|{\\text{\\boldmath{$\\theta$}}})$ ] . the variance and covariance of the income share implied from this likelihood",
    "are given by @xmath21(1 - e[q_{j}])}{\\lambda + 1 } , \\quad { \\text{cov}}(q_{i } , q_{j } ) = -\\frac{e[q_{i}]e[q_{j}]}{\\lambda + 1},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 acts as a precision parameter .",
    "larger values of @xmath19 suggest that the smaller variation of the income shares are implied from the lorenz curve .",
    "based on this likelihood function , chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2005 ) considered an mcmc method in the bayesian framework by specifying the prior distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath19 .",
    "although the dirichlet likelihood approach of chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 , 2005 ) may appear convenient , it has the following problems .",
    "the parameter estimates and the resulting gini estimate can be highly sensitive with respective to the choice of the value or prior distribution of @xmath19 , since data do not contain information on this parameter .",
    "the sensitivity is especially profound when the number of groups is small .",
    "furthermore , the evaluation of the likelihood function requires the evaluation of @xmath22 for @xmath23 . except for some simple standard distributions , such as the lognormal , singh - maddala , and dagum",
    ", some flexible classes of hypothetical income distributions do not admit an analytical form of the lorenz curve or the evaluation of the lorenz curve is computationally expensive .",
    "therefore , the inference based on the dirichlet approach can be unreliable and its applicability would be limited .",
    "we work on the likelihood function implied from the lorenz curve of the hypothetical income distribution .",
    "this likelihood function is constructed through the statistics of the individual household incomes whose distribution is not explicitly defined .",
    "thus , the standard mcmc methods can not be directly applied , because these methods require evaluating the likelihood function and prior density .",
    "the approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) methods avoid direct evaluation of the likelihood function and simulate data from the model , given a candidate parameter value .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , if the simulated and observed data are similar , the candidate value can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution .",
    "the posterior distribution can be approximated by weighting the intractable likelihood function .",
    "therefore , abc is a convenient approach when the likelihood function is not explicitly available or computationally prohibitive to evaluate , because it requires only being able to simulate data from the probability model .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the prior density of the parameter @xmath6 , @xmath25 be the likelihood function of the observed data @xmath5 , and @xmath26 be the posterior distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "abc methods augment the posterior from @xmath27 to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a tolerance level , @xmath30 is the indicator function of the set @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the simulated data .",
    "the set @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a distance function .",
    "the value of @xmath36 and form of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are chosen by the user and can affect the performance of abc .",
    "the marginal distribution @xmath39 provides an approximation to @xmath27 for sufficiently small @xmath36 .",
    "various abc algorithms to sample from the approximate posterior distribution based on , for example , rejection sampling ( beaumont  .",
    "2002 ) , mcmc ( marjoram  .  2003",
    "; fearnhead and prangle  2012 ) , and the sequential monte carlo ( smc ) method ( sisson  .  2007 ,  2009 ; beaumont  .  2009 ; toni  .  2009 ) have been proposed .",
    "furthermore , a number of extensions of the smc algorithm has been considered by , for example , del  moral .",

    "( 2013 ) , filippi .",
    "( 2013 ) , silk .",
    "( 2013 ) , and bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) .",
    "we employ the smc approach because it is difficult to construct an efficient proposal distribution for mcmc in the present context and the smc with adaptive weights proposed by bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) , among others , is adopted because of its computational efficiency and ease of implementation .",
    "the smc algorithm proceeds by sampling from a series of intermediate distributions with user - specified decreasing tolerance levels , @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "a large number of particles , denoted by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is propagated by using importance sampling and resampling until the target tolerance level @xmath46 is reached .",
    "bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) proposed to approximate the intermediate distribution at each step by kernel smoothing with the joint kernel @xmath47 .",
    "bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) employed the product kernel such that @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is uniform over @xmath50 in the standard smc of sission  .",

    "algorithm  [ alg ] describes the method of bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) .",
    "introducing a kernel function for @xmath32 modifies the perturbation step of the algorithm in such a way that particles for which the simulated @xmath32 is close to @xmath5 are more likely to be chosen .",
    "bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) showed that the proposal distribution of their algorithm has higher prior predictive density over the acceptance region for the next step  and hence , higher acceptance probability  than that of the standard smc algorithm .",
    "finally , the posterior distribution of @xmath6 at step @xmath51 of the algorithm is approximated by @xmath52    initialise tolerance levels @xmath53 and set @xmath54 .",
    "simulate @xmath55 from @xmath24 and @xmath56 from @xmath57 .",

    "[ alg ] , we set @xmath68 , which was also employed in mcvinish  ( 2012 ) , because the choice of the tolerance schedule and level of approximation is intuitive . to simulate @xmath32 , @xmath3 observations independently and identically distributed to the hypothetical income distribution is generated .",
    "then , they are sorted in the ascending order , denoted by @xmath69 , and the cumulative income share is computed using @xmath70 , where @xmath71 for @xmath72 .    following bonassi and west  ( 2015 ) ,",
    "the product of normal kernels is used for @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the data are orthogonalised and the product of normal kernels is applied . following the rule of thumb for the product of normal kernels , the bandwidth",
    "is determined based on @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of particles , @xmath75 is the dimension , and @xmath76 is the standard deviation for @xmath77 ( scott and sain  2005 ; bonassi and west  2015 ) .",
    "when the number of groups is large , such as @xmath78 in decile data , the performance of abc may be affected ( see , , prangle  2015 ) , as algorithm  [ alg ] compares two nine - dimensional vectors . to reduce the dimensionality , we can also use summary statistics that consist of a subset of the elements of the cumulative incomes .",
    "for example , when @xmath78 , we can replace @xmath5 and @xmath32 in algorithm  [ alg ] with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "note that if we take @xmath81 , it is identical to the simulated data in the case of @xmath82 .",
    "the use of the summary statistics in the case of @xmath78 is also examined in section  [ sec : ne ] .    alternatively , we could work on the income shares as in chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "note that the space of @xmath83 and corresponding @xmath32 is the @xmath0-simplex .",
    "therefore , this implies that the smc with adaptive weights approximates the joint distribution by kernel smoothing over the @xmath0-simplex with respect to @xmath32 . to proceed in this direction ,",
    "a kernel function on the simplex is required .",
    "for example , an approach recently proposed by chacn .",
    "( 2011 ) , which is based on the @xmath84 dimensional normal kernel applied to the isometric log - ratio ( ilr ) transformed data ( egozcue .",
    "2003 ) , would be a convenient choice .",
    "the advantage of the ilr kernel for simplex over the other transformation methods includes the invariance with respect to the choice of basis and the flexibility in the choice of the bandwidth matrix . in the present context , the product of normal kernels can be applied to orthogonalised ilr transformed data .",
    "the distance is calculated for the ilr transformed data and the bandwidths can be determined in the same manner as above . while this approach has the same performance as the one working on the original vectors , the choice of the tolerance schedule and level of approximation is less intuitive .",
    "therefore , we do not pursue this hereafter .      in order to estimate the lorenz curve and the related inequality measures accurately , a flexible class of hypothetical distributions",
    "is required .",
    "this paper adopts the five - parameter generalised beta ( gb ) distribution denoted by @xmath85 as an interesting and important income distribution .",
    "this distribution was by proposed by mcdonald and xu  ( 1995 ) and is the most flexible distribution of the family of beta - type distributions .",
    "the probability density function of the gb distribution is given by @xmath86^{q - 1}}{\\displaystyle b ^ { a p } b(p , q ) \\left [ 1 + c \\left ( \\frac{x}{b } \\right)^{a } \\right]^{p + q}},\\quad 0 < x^{a } < \\frac{b^{a}}{1 - c } ,      \\label{gb : prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the beta function . using the incomplete beta function @xmath91 , the cumulative distribution function is given by @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "given a set of parameter values , the gini coefficient can be easily computed from by using numerical integration .",
    "the gb distribution includes a number of special cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the gb distribution reduces to the generalised beta distributions of the first kind and second kind ( gb2 ) ( mcdonald  1984 ) , respectively . moreover , when @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the distribution reduces to the singh - maddala ( sm ) distribution ( singh and maddala  1976 ) and dagum ( da ) distribution ( dagum  1977 ) , which are known to perform well in many empirical applications .",
    "detailed relationships among the class of distributions are summarised in mcdonald and xu  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the hypothetical gb distribution can also be directly estimated from the level grouped income data by using the mcmc method ( kakamu and nishino  2016 ) . as mentioned in section  [ sec : abc ] , the likelihood function implied from the lorenz curve is not explicitly available .",
    "furthermore , even the pseudo - likelihood based on the dirichlet distribution is not explicitly available and the evaluation of the likelihood would be computationally expensive and unstable , because an explicit formula of the lorenz curve for the gb distribution is not available ( mcdonald and ransom , 2008 ) .",
    "this is also the case for the gb2 distribution .",
    "therefore , the abc method would be a convenient approach to estimating the lorenz curve with the hypothetical gb distribution .",
    "note that the random variable @xmath98 can be easily generated by using @xmath99 where @xmath100 ( kakamu and nishino  2016 ) .",
    "since the lorenz curve is location - free , we let @xmath101 . in algorithm",
    "[ alg ] , @xmath32 is simulated from @xmath102 by using .",
    "a series of simulation studies is conducted to illustrate the proposed approach .",
    "first , the individual household income follows the dagum ( da ) and singh - maddala ( sm ) distributions , denoted by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the two existing methods .",
    "since both distributions allow the explicit forms of lorenz curves , the method proposed by chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2005 ) can be implemented .",
    "the method of chotikapanich and griffiths  ( 2005 ) is based on the dirichlet likelihood given by and estimates @xmath105 and @xmath106 by using the metropolis - hastings ( mh ) algorithm .",
    "in addition , the method of kakamu  ( 2015 ) , which is based on the likelihood function for the order statistics and estimates the parameters by using the mh algorithm , is also implemented .    to create the data for this simulation study ,",
    "@xmath107 observations are generated from @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "then , the data are sorted in ascending order and are grouped into @xmath0 groups to calculate the income and household shares .",
    "the data are replicated 100 times . for the dagum distribution ,",
    "the following four settings for the true parameter values and corresponding gini coefficients are considered : ( i ) @xmath110 , ( ii ) @xmath111 , ( iii)@xmath112 , ( iv)@xmath113 . for the singh - maddala distribution ,",

    "the figure shows that the computing time of the algorithm increases as the number of groups increases in all cases .",
    "we compare two nine - dimensional vectors when @xmath78 , leading to large numbers of rejections , but the computing time can be decreased by using the summary statistics .",
