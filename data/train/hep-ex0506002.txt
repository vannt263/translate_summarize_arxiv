    "measuring any properties of the neutrino is a formidable experimental challenge .",
    "it took e.g. more than 40 years after its discovery to prove that the neutrino is massive  @xcite , though it has still not been possible to assign an absolute value to the mass . to prove , whether the neutrino is a dirac or a majorana particle is another challenge that still lies ahead , and rather significant experimental effort is presently being mounted in different laboratories to prove its majorana character . here",
    "it is the lepton number violating neutrinoless @xmath0  decay , which is at the center of attention .",
    "so far , the experiments to measure the @xmath0  decay properties have exclusively been focussing on the @xmath1variant . in these cases",
    "one attempts to measure the spectrum of the two emitted electrons , where a discrete line at the endpoint energy carries the signature of a @xmath5  decay , and hence , of a majorana neutrino involved .",
    "although favored by phase space , the @xmath5  decay remains elusive because the decay rate is proportional to the square of the effective neutrino mass , which is the unknown .",
    "the decay rate further contains an unknown and rather complicated nuclear matrix element , which makes precise theoretical predictions of the decay rate rather involved .",
    "experiments are therefore driven by what one considers the most promising cases and , at the same time , by what one considers technically most feasible .",
    "experiments that are presently at a rather advanced stage are those concerned with @xmath6ge , @xmath7mo and @xmath8te  @xmath1decays  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to note that little attention has been given to alternative decay modes in @xmath0  decay .",
    "i will shortly review , why this is the case rather than go into any of the details of the existing or proposed experiments .",
    "indeed , it turns out that there may be at least one viable and technically feasible alternative for measuring the @xmath0  decay in a way that one could prove unambiguously the majorana character of the neutrino .",
    "it may be instructive to recall some of the leading factors that characterize the decay rate of the @xmath0decay . in the case of the @xmath1  type ,",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath9  decay rate is rather straightforward ( assuming a @xmath10 transition ) leading to the simplified expression  @xcite :    @xmath11 ^4 \\mathcal{f_{\\!(-)}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!^2   \\;\\;|m_{dgt}^{(2\\nu)}|^2 \\;\\ ; f(q)\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{f_{\\!(-)}}&\\!\\!\\!\\!=&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\frac{2\\pi\\alpha z}{1-\\exp(-2\\pi\\alpha z ) }   \\label{nnbmbm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath12 is the fermi constant , @xmath13 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath14 is the coulomb factor for @xmath15 decay , @xmath16 the fine structure constant and @xmath17 the final z - value of the nucleus .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is a relativistic correction term for @xmath0  decay , which enhances the decay for high - z nuclei ( c is of order unity for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of a polynomial of order @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the q - value of the reaction .",
    "this high q - value dependence is essentially a result of the phase space .",
    "the nuclear structure dependence is given by the @xmath0  decay matrix element @xmath25 .",
    "for the case of @xmath9  decay this matrix element is the product of two gamow - teller transition operators , which one could readily measure through charge - exchange reactions in the @xmath26 and @xmath15 direction at intermediate energies ( 100 - 200 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "there are many recent examples where these matrix elements have been determined through @xmath27 and @xmath28 reactions or more recently through @xmath29he@xmath30 and @xmath31he ) reactions  @xcite .",
    "the high q - value dependence makes certain nuclei particularly promising , like for instance @xmath32ca with the largest q - value in the periodic table of 4.271  mev or @xmath33nd with the second largest one of 3.368  mev , which comes with an additional advantageously large z - value of z=60 .",
    "both have , however , a low isotopic abundance ( 0.18% and 5.6% ) , which , apart form other technical difficulties , makes them less attractive ( though there are new initiatives like candles or sno@xmath34 being put forward ) .",
    "one may also note that the nuclear matrix element @xmath25 can alter the situation significantly . in the case of @xmath32ca",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that the gamow - teller transitions , which excite the intermediate @xmath35 states in @xmath32sc for the @xmath26 direction rather strongly , do this only weakly for the @xmath15 direction and vice versa .",
    "this `` state - mismatch '' makes @xmath32ca particularly stable .",
    "further , for high - z nuclei the @xmath26 direction of the gamow - teller ( gt ) operator , which connects the ground state of the daughter with the @xmath35 states of the intermediate nucleus may be severely pauli blocked as a consequence of the large ( n - z ) value . in how far nuclear deformation at high",
    "z enters into the matrix elements ( like e.g. for @xmath33nd ) is also still a matter of debate .",
    "the structure of the formula for the @xmath5  decay is not very much different from eq .",
    "[ nnbmbm ] , except that the square of the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath36 enters into the formula .",
    "the effective neutrino mass is given as :    @xmath37    with @xmath38 being the elements of the mixing matrix containing two mixing angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 as well as two cp phases @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 being the three corresponding mass eigenvalues .",
    "the q - value dependence is less pronounced ( only @xmath44 ) , however , the nuclear matrix elements in this case are significantly more complex .",
    "because the majorana neutrino appears in the description as a virtual particle with a momentum transfer typically of order @xmath45 , the propagator includes a multitude of virtual transitions in the intermediate nucleus . to get experimental information about these matrix elements",
    "may be an insurmountable task , unless one could show theoretically , that low lying states of lowest multipolarity ( e.g. @xmath35 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 states ) would be the strongest contributors to the matrix elements  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "charge - exchange reactions could be employed to give stronger bounds to the theoretical evaluations of the @xmath5  decay rates .",
    "present experimental lower bounds of the half - lives for the @xmath5  decays are in excess of @xmath48y , which would give upper bounds for the majorana neutrino mass of significantly less then 1 ev depending on the model for the nuclear matrix elements .",
    "there is only one experiment so far , which has claimed evidence for the @xmath5  decay with a half - life of @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "1.8 mm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ecec ]    in table  [ ecec ] are listed all nuclei , which for energy reasons can only undergo a double - electron capture ( @xmath52 ) process .",
    "it is once again interesting to note that isotopic abundances are low with two marked exceptions , @xmath53ca and @xmath54ce . in cases where the q - values do not allow an excitation of the final nucleus",
    ", the @xmath55  mode would leave no further trace , except the de - excitation of the atomic shell through x - ray or auger electron emissions . in the @xmath2  mode the excess energy would have to be radiated away through an extra radiative process as already discussed above . since in the @xmath56 case",
    ", radiative processes may compete at the same levels , one would be left with a continuum @xmath57-ray background below a possible mono - energetic photon line at the maximum decay energy .",
    "the spectrum would be reminiscent of the @xmath1 decay spectrum , but in a rather different energy regime .",
    "there is a limited number of nuclei ( @xmath58xe , @xmath59ba , @xmath60dy , @xmath61w and @xmath62hg ) where excited states can be reached , thereby providing the necessary tag for the decay ; there is only one nucleus ( @xmath62hg ) , where a cascade would provide two reasonably high energy @xmath57-ray lines for final state identification .",
    "however , above mass @xmath63 , @xmath16-decay q - values are of order @xmath64 mev making @xmath16-decay by far the more dominant decay mode creating an almost irreducible background .    despite the fact that one can imagine unconquerable experimental difficulties , if one ever wanted to get involved in such an experimental endeavor , it is nevertheless instructive to enter into a discussion about some of the properties of the @xmath52  decay .    to estimate the rate of the @xmath2  processes , eq .",

    "this function scales with @xmath67 , thus , favoring heavy nuclei ; @xmath68 describes radiative photon production , and @xmath36 is the square of the majorana neutrino mass .",
    "the nuclear physics enters into @xmath69 and @xmath70 being generalized double gamow - teller and fermi - operators , which already include the higher order multipoles .",
    "note that the usual phase space factor does not appear anymore , thus , high rates are expected for the low q - values , for which the photon propagator diverges as @xmath71 .",
    "this is in contrast to the other non - radiative decay modes discussed above .",
    "wycech and sujkowski  @xcite estimated rates for the @xmath2  decays for several of the nuclei in table  [ ecec ] and find half - lives , which are of order @xmath72 years .",
    "their calculations do , however , not contain all effects of the atomic shell .",
    "nevertheless , there is an interesting effect already noted by these authors .",
    "if the q - value of the @xmath2  decay matches the binding energy of the atomic shell , a resonant enhancement of the decay rate by several orders of magnitude could be expected , bringing the half - life down to @xmath73y or even below ( for a 1 ev mass of the neutrino ) .",
    "the case , which was discussed , is the @xmath74 transition @xmath75gd(@xmath2)@xmath76sm , which features the second lowest q - value of only 56 kev .",
    "this value is close to a ( 1s2s ) atomic two - hole excitation .",
    "it was , however , also argued that , if the degeneracy is not complete , then the release of the excess energy requires a magnetic radiative process to balance the angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "atomic de - excitation would then proceed through x - ray or auger - electron emission in the usual way .",
    "however , apart from the difficulty to capture any of the radiation , one would in this case also have to cope with the presence of an @xmath16-decay , which would be by many orders of magnitude more intense ( @xmath77 mev , @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , the authors also briefly point to a possibility of a transition to an excited state in the final daughter nucleus .",
    "certainly , one would assume that a q - value in a @xmath52  process , which exactly matches an excited state in the final nucleus added to the atomic shell excitation would be a coincidence too much to ask for .",
    "some remarks on the angular momentum balancing may be in order at this stage . the term @xmath2  hides the fact that in all relevant cases the excess decay energy must be radiated away by an extra photon ( i. e. through a @xmath79 process as indicated in fig .",
    "[ examples ] ) .",
    "since an electron - capture process predominantly involves an @xmath80 electron with only a few percent contribution from @xmath81 electrons due to relativistic effects , the @xmath79 process , which creates a double k - shell vacancy , can not balance angular momentum in a @xmath74 transition , unlike its @xmath55  counterpart .",
    "however , from the single electron - capture process it is known that it possesses a dominant inner bremsstrahlung ( ibec ) component as a result of the sudden change of charge in the atom .",
    "this process renders it a three - body decay with a continuous photon spectrum theoretically extending to an end - point defined by the q - value  @xcite .",
    "the radiative capture process proceeds with a probability of about @xmath82 per captured event depending on the total available energy  @xcite .",
    "from the view of perturbation theory , ibec is a second order process , in which both electromagnetic and weak transitions contribute  @xcite .",
    "initial and final states are connected by a set of intermediate ( bound ) states reminiscent of the two - neutrino nuclear double - beta decay case . the ibec process is particularly interesting for q - values , which are close to the typical x - ray energies involved , like in the cases of near degeneracy discussed here . in these cases transitions",
    "get greatly enhanced over those that require significantly higher photon energies .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] . an @xmath83 electron emits e1 radiation and transforms into an intermediate @xmath84 electron . from this state , which has a non - vanishing electron density at the origin ,",
    "the electron weakly interacts with the nucleus and gets captured , thereby leaving a vacancy in the @xmath83 state and also making a @xmath79 @xmath74 an allowed transition .",
    "pronounced resonances occur in the x - ray spectrum at various positions reflecting the difference of the binding energy of the two states involved .",
    "this process has been verified in a rather impressive experiment performed by springer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on @xmath85ho , which features the lowest capture q - value of @xmath86 .",
    "the ibec process can , of course , directly be adapted to the case of double - electron capture .",
    "a rich number of possible resonant states can be reached in the regime of lowest q - value , thereby also allowing different angular momentum couplings .",
    "se@xmath2  decay indicating the near degeneracy of the @xmath3seground state and the second excited state in @xmath3ge .",
    "the circle marks the part , which is magnified in the lower part of the figure . ]",
    "as already indicated , the @xmath2  process of @xmath3se  exhibits a situation of near degeneracy between the parent and an excited state of the daughter .",
    "the q - value of @xmath87 mev for the @xmath2  process matches to within 5 kev the second excited state of the daughter at 1.204 mev , which subsequently de - excites through a 609 kev and 595 kev cascade .",
    "therefore , the mere feeding of this state would already indicate the majorana nature of the neutrino , as there is no phase space left for a two - neutrino decay mode .",
    "the situation gets even more fortuitous as the @xmath88  variant is also lacking phase space , because of the energy penalty of @xmath89 mev , which is to be subtracted from the above q - value .",
    "thus , there will be no 511 kev annihilation line at any significant level for this decay .",
    "the decay deserves a closer look . in fig .",
    "[ selenium ] the energetics of the decay is sketched in detail .",
    "first , it is noted that the q - value is only known to within an error of 2.3 kev ( here : 1.6/1.7 kev error on each mass ) , a fact , which is to be kept in mind in the following discussion .",
    "the double - electron capture process leaves the final daughter atom in an excited state with two inner - shell holes , but otherwise neutral .",
    "this inner - shell excitation has to be subtracted from the q - value .",
    "already for energy reasons , a capture of two electrons from the k - shell is not allowed .",
    "a double k - shell binding energy of @xmath90 kev would have to be paid , which places the effective q - value of the reaction below the @xmath91 kev excitation in @xmath3ge  near 1186 kev . to estimate",
    "the binding energy one can assume an intermediate charge of @xmath92 ( @xmath3as ) for the first capture process and @xmath93 ( @xmath3ge ) for the second .",
    "similarly , a k- and an l - shell hole places the effective q - value at 1196.8 kev , which is about 7 kev below the nuclear level . creating a double l - shell vacancy , however , will cost an energy of about 2.9 kev , and the effective q - value now lies 2 kev above the 1204 kev level .",
    "this 2 kev value further coincides with the present precision , with which the mass difference is known , and one may already speculate about a possible complete energy degeneracy with an atomic final state ( including one created through an ibec process ) .",
    "such a degeneracy would present a singular opportunity , as the @xmath2  rate could now be enormously enhanced .",
    "clearly , an effort should be undertaken to re - measure the masses of @xmath3se  and @xmath3ge  to within a precision of @xmath94 .",
    "this ought to be an easy task using today s ion trap facilities , like e.g. the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite . given the estimates of wycech et al .",
    "@xcite , the half - life could well get into a measurable regime , even in a case of a non - complete degeneracy .",
    "a thorough and detailed theoretical treatment of the atomic shell is therefore urgently warranted . on the experimental side",
    ", the detection would require the measurement of the @xmath57-ray de - excitation , preferentially in coincidence mode to discriminate against background .",
    "the rather low @xmath3seisotopic abundance of @xmath95 requires an enrichment of rather large quantities .",
    "however , the techniques of measuring extremely low radioactivity levels is well advanced and manageable  @xcite .",
    "the physics of @xmath0  decay has been reviewed , however , focussing on the alternative decays @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the @xmath52 .",
    "although the @xmath52 process is generally being viewed as unattractive for an experiment , the @xmath2  decay of @xmath3se  offers a remarkable experimental chance to identify the majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "this is due to an accidental , almost complete degeneracy of the parent ground state with the second excited state in the daughter nucleus @xmath3ge .",
    "this degeneracy can enhance the @xmath2  process by many orders of magnitude .",
    "further , the de - excitation of the @xmath3ge  daughter proceeds through an easy to detect @xmath4-ray cascade , which by its mere detection identifies the neutrino as a majorana particle .",
    "a key ingredient into the rate determination is the exact knowledge of the masses of the two nuclei , @xmath3se  and @xmath3ge .",
    "a precision of order 10 ev appears possible using today s ion trap facilities .",
    "such an experiment should be attempted .",
    "the exact rate estimate relies on a rather involved and detailed theoretical treatment of the decay process , where most of the work appears in the treatment of the atomic shell effects .",
    "a theoretical understanding of these processes may be the first important task , if one ever wanted to consider a large scale experiment .",
