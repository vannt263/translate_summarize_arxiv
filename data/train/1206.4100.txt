    "the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe ( _ baryogenesis _ ) is one of the greatest puzzles of modern cosmology .",
    "no `` standard model '' of baryogenesis exists , nor does it seem possible to accommodate baryogenesis within the standard model of particle physics @xcite , although numerous hypothetical frameworks have been investigated within various extensions to the standard model ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .    of all the known options for a dynamical generation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , one that may soon be conclusively tested is the framework of electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) .",
    "this scenario generically entails the existence of particles that have electroweak quantum numbers and that are light enough to be in thermal equilibrium at the electroweak phase transition , when the universe had a temperature of around 100 gev .",
    "a host of phenomenological consequences then follows :    \\(i ) light , electroweakly - interacting particles should be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , making ewb testable with colliders ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ;    \\(ii ) large enough cp violation and light enough new electroweakly - interacting particles generically produce sizable electric dipole moments ( edms ) , via one- or two - loop effects , to the level probed , or close to being probed , by experiments ( for recent studies see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ;    \\(iii ) if the lightest electroweakly - interacting particle is stable , it could be the dark matter ; recent studies @xcite indicate that if this is the case , the resulting dark matter particle should be detectable with the current generation of dark matter search experiments ;    \\(iv ) bubble collisions at the necessarily strongly first - order ew phase transition produce gravity waves with characteristic frequency @xmath1 , which , today , have a frequency @xmath2 mhz , in the range where the sensitivity of planned space - based interferometers peaks ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "broadly , the above phenomenological probes make ewb a testable scenario , even though quantitative predictions necessarily depend on the specifics of the model under consideration . for several reasons , independent of baryogenesis , a supersymmetric extension to the standard model",
    "has long been advocated as a particularly compelling one , with the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) its simplest paradigm .",
    "the mssm contains enough degrees of freedom to overcome the two key difficulties encountered in embedding ewb within the standard model : ( i ) producing a strongly first order phase transition to prevent baryon number wash - out , and ( ii ) providing large enough sources of cp violation to quantitatively explain the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the first difficulty is overcome either by advocating a light scalar top ( hereafter `` stop '' ) ( there are numerous studies in this vein , from ref .",
    "@xcite to ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by invoking a non - minimal higgs sector comprising additional singlet fields ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , or by advocating higher - dimensional operators ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . with regards to ( ii ) , additional cp violating sources are also easily found in the mssm parameter space .",
    "currently , the electroweak scale is under close scrutiny at the lhc , and ewb is either on the brink of discovery or of being convincingly ruled out , at least in its simplest incarnations . to address the question of whether or not ewb might be nature s mechanism of choice to produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , it is imperative to investigate in great detail all possible open corners of the mssm parameter space that could be related to this scenario .",
    "recent important progress has been made in evaluating the impact of the lhc program on point ( i ) above , with strong implications for the light - stop scenario @xcite but also for frameworks with non - minimal higgs sectors @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we concern ourselves , instead , with issue ( ii ) above : which mssm sector could have provided the cp violating sources necessary to feed the production of a baryon asymmetry at the electroweak phase transition ?",
    "we leave aside here the ( equally interesting , but separate ) question of the mechanism responsible for producing a strongly enough first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "the present study is intended to provide a qualitative and quantitative step forward in closing in on the allowed parameter space for supersymmetric ewb models .",
    "supersymmetric ewb has been extensively studied in many different contexts in the recent and not - so - recent past ( see e.g. refs .",
    "most previous studies of ewb in the mssm have insisted and focused on the cp violation relevant to produce the baryon asymmetry as occurring in the higgsino - gaugino sector .",
    "this scenario generically forces a close degeneracy between one ( or both ) of the electroweak gaugino soft supersymmetry breaking masses @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the supersymmetric @xmath5 parameter , perhaps raising concerns about naturalness since @xmath6 and @xmath5 have entirely disconnected origins . additionally , electroweak two - loop contributions to edms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the complete set of relevant two - loop contributions ) provide stringent constraints on the viable parameter space .",
    "perhaps more importantly , there does not need to be any cp violation in the gaugino - higgsino `` fermionic '' supersymmetric sector for ewb to be successful . as noted long ago @xcite , cp violation in the stop sector",
    "is potentially an important source for ewb in the mssm ( and beyond @xcite ) .",
    "stop sources have not received much attention in previous studies primarily because of the superficial tension that typically exists between producing the correct bau and having a phenomenology consistent with observation .",
    "this point can be illustrated in short as follows : the phase transition in the mssm is typically made strongly first order by a light right - handed stop ( typically in the sub-100 gev range  for an updated analysis see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; since the stop cp - violating sources are resonant for @xmath7 , the parameter space most likely to produce the observed bau has light , nearly degenerate stops .",
    "however , light stops are tightly constrained by the higgs mass , electroweak precision observables , and electric dipole moments ( edms ) , along with null results from collider searches , thus making it difficult to have successful stop - sourced ewb along with a strongly first - order phase transition",
    ".    if the ratio @xmath0 of the two higgs vacuum expectation values in the mssm is sufficiently large , the yukawa couplings of the down - type third generation fermions are generically of the same order as the top yukawa coupling , therefore non - negligibly interacting with the higgs fields .",
    "if this is the case , one would expect new contributions to the cp violating sources responsible for the generation of a net charge density of left - handed fermions , in turn fueling baryon number density production via weak sphalerons at the ew phase transition @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , down - type fermion superfields do not contribute to the strength of the ew phase transition , since the cubic term they produce in the effective potential is counter - balanced by a @xmath8 factor , making down - type contributions smaller than the top contributions by factors of @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , cp sources relevant for ewb from scalar bottom and @xmath10 are generically significant in the large @xmath0 regime . in this work , for the first time",
    ", we quantitatively study these sources , and we assess the impact of edms if cp violation is indeed sourced in the down - type ( s)fermion sector .    this manuscript is structured as follows : we first elucidate , in sec .",
    "[ sec : asymmetry ] the physical modeling of the electroweak phase transition relevant for the calculation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , including details of the approximations we make and of the associated expected systematic effects .",
    "we then focus on stop sources in sec .",
    "[ sec : stops ] , and study several slices of the relevant parameter space .",
    "we consider constraints from higgs searches , ew precision observables , direct searches for supersymmetric particles with the lhc , and we devote special attention to constraints from edm searches .",
    "[ sec : largetanbeta ] then studies the large @xmath0 regime and the new class of cp violating sources introduced in this study : quasi - degenerate sbottoms and staus . as for stops sources , we investigate all relevant constraints , with special emphasis on edm searches .",
    "the main result of the present study is that the current edm search limits  particularly the one obtained for the mercury atom @xcite  eliminate the possibility that cp violating sources stemming from light and/or quasi - degenerate stops or sbottoms could be the main triggers for successful ewb . on the other hand ,",
    "a new class of cp violating sources associated with third generation sleptons is subject to considerably weaker edm constraints .",
    "consequently , these sources can successfully generate the production of the net left - handed chiral charge needed to produce the observed baryon asymmetry at the ew phase transition .",
    "this stau - mediated ewb \" is possible , however , only in relatively narrow strips of parameter space where the two stau mass eigenstates are almost degenerate .    in view of the fast pace with which the lhc is exploring the electroweak scale , and especially the supersymmetric sfermion sector , evaluating the potential relevance of sfermions to produce the observed baryon asymmetry appears to us as a timely topic .",
    "in addition , the program of searches for edms at the `` intensity frontier '' is also here demonstrated to be highly synergistic to the collider `` energy frontier '' ; searches for the edm of multiple particle and atomic species is also crucial to testing the ew route to baryogenesis . finally , while it is too early to draw strong conclusions , lhc searches for the higgs might indirectly point to a scenario with light staus ( see e.g. @xcite ) , potentially making the new source class we discovered all the more appealing .",
    "in the framework of supersymmetric ewb , the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced by @xmath11 sphalerons acting on a charge density of left - handed fermions , generated by cp - violating sources @xmath12 associated with the electroweak phase transition .",
    "as bubbles of broken electroweak symmetry nucleate and expand , the cp - violating phases between the supersymmetric particles and the background higgs fields lead to the production of net charge densities when ( s)particles scatter off of the ewpt bubble wall . in the present study we concern ourselves with scalar sources associated with third - generation ( s)quarks and ( s)leptons , as their yukawa couplings are much larger than those of their first- and second - generation counterparts .",
    "in addition , we focus on the large @xmath0 regime , where third - generation down - type yukawa couplings become comparable to the top yukawa coupling , and therefore relevant in scattering off of higgs fields . the relevant part of the mssm lagrangian describing the associated cp - violating interactions in the gauge eigenstate basis reads : @xmath13 where cp - violating phases can arise between the various triscalar couplings @xmath14 , @xmath5 , and the higgs soft mass parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we henceforth denote this phase for species @xmath16 as @xmath17 . without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume @xmath15 to be real so that @xmath18 in what follows .",
    "in addition to the cp - violating sources , there are several cp - conserving processes arising from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) that affect particle number @xmath19 for the relevant species in the mssm .",
    "there are relaxation terms associated with chirality - changing particle scattering off of the higgs vevs , with corresponding thermally - averaged rates @xmath20 .",
    "there are triscalar and supersymmetric yukawa interactions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) without replacing @xmath21 by their vevs ; as discussed below , the assumption of supergauge equilibrium allows us to combine the rates for both types of processes which we write as @xmath22 . for the squarks",
    ", there are also @xmath23 sphalerons , with rate @xmath24 , that produce 1st- and 2nd - generation squarks from a 3rd - generation density and vice - versa .",
    "finally , weak sphalerons ultimately convert the left - handed particle density @xmath25 to a net baryon asymmetry with rate @xmath26 .",
    "a complete set of expressions for these various sources can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for additional details of the calculation .",
    "we follow refs .",
    "@xcite and work in the higgs vev - insertion approximation , in which it is assumed that the sources in the bubble wall are strongest near the unbroken phase and where one uses a basis of @xmath11 gauge eigenstates , expanding about flavor - diagonal states in the bubble wall .",
    "this approximation tends to overestimate the resulting baryon asymmetry and clearly breaks down farther inside the wall where flavor mixing can not be neglected .",
    "however the vev - insertion approximation is expected to characterize the production of the bau to order unity accuracy @xcite .",
    "recent studies have worked out the flavor oscillations in the bubble wall beyond the vev - insertion approximation for a toy model @xcite , and found qualitatively similar results to those obtained in the vev - insertion approximation , including a resonance in the various sources .",
    "although a treatment beyond the vev - insertion approximation is desirable for an accurate assessment of ewb in the mssm , since we will be looking at the baryon asymmetry across a wide range of parameter space with other inherent uncertainties , we content ourselves with the vev - insertion approximation , deferring a more detailed analysis including flavor - mixing effects to future study .",
    "our results can thus be interpreted as a  best case scenario \" for ewb with scalar sources in the mssm , albeit we also show results that would correspond to a factor 10 smaller net bau , to guide the reader to a more conservative interpretation .",
    "proceeding within the outlined framework for computing the baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath27 , the weak sphaleron rate @xmath26 is typically much slower than the rates for the creation and diffusion of the left - handed charge density @xmath25 ahead of the ewpt bubble wall .",
    "this allows us to consider separately the diffusion equations for the various ( s)particle densities and the creation of the baryon density @xmath28 , which is given , in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath25 , and the bubble wall velocity @xmath29 as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance from the bubble wall in the wall rest frame ( neglecting the wall curvature ) and where the unbroken ew phase corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the left handed charge density @xmath25 is given by the sum of the charge densities of the various left - handed quarks and leptons @xmath33 where the sum runs over all colors and generations and @xmath34 , @xmath35 denote the difference of particle and antiparticle densities for each species .",
    "the charge densities entering into the expression for @xmath25 are obtained from a set of coupled quantum boltzmann equations ( described below ) which , once solved , allow one to compute @xmath28 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : bau ] ) .",
    "detailed derivations of the quantum boltzmann equations ( qbes ) governing the generation of the bau have been discussed at length in the existing literature ( see e.g. ref .",

    "the zero - temperature stop mass eigenstates can turn negative in some of the parameter space ; the corresponding regions are of course ruled out by direct searches for stops , corresponding to the black shaded regions in figs .",
    "[ fig : stop_sources1]-[fig : stop_sources2 ] .",
    "finally , we find that there are regions for which the produced baryon asymmetry switches sign .",
    "this effect arises due to the competition between @xmath164 and @xmath75 densities in the expression for @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nl_1 ] ) ; since @xmath164 and @xmath75 densities carry opposite sign , when @xmath90 is small , @xmath165 decreases and the @xmath75 contribution can win out and drive @xmath166 . in figs .",

    "having calculated the bau resulting from stop sources , one should ask how the stop mass parameter space consistent with successful ewb confronts various other phenomenological constraints .",
    "we consider three types of constraints on our ewb scenario : stop mass constraints from collider searches , higgs mass bounds , and electric dipole moment search null results .",

    "increasing @xmath143 leads to larger regions of parameter space for which the lightest stop falls below the lower bound .",
    "this is because the triscalar coupling appears in the off - diagonal entries in the stop mass matrix and large values reduce the value of the smaller eigenvalue .",
    "the mass of the sm higgs has been constrained by lep to be @xmath174 gev @xcite .",
    "we use ` feynhiggs ` to calculate the mass of the sm - like higgs to two - loop order and indicate the lep bound by a thick red line on our plots .",
    "in addition to the lower bound from lep , recent preliminary results from both atlas and cms experiments have indicated the possibility of a sm - like higgs with @xmath175 gev @xcite . however , for light stops and small @xmath143 , the corrections to @xmath176 arising from diagrams with stop loops typically needed to increase the mass of the sm - like higgs in the mssm are suppressed , and we find no parameter space consistent with @xmath177 gev . for larger @xmath143 , the stop loop corrections can be enhanced and the higgs mass can be pushed up to @xmath178 gev ( which we indicate on the plot corresponding to @xmath179 gev , @xmath180 gev with a red dotted line ) , however we find that @xmath177 gev is difficult to obtain for our choices of parameters .",
    "we note that additional field content , such as the inclusion of a gauge singlet in the superpotential in e.g. the nmssm , which may be required to provide a strongly first order phase transition in these scenarios , can result in large contributions to @xmath176 , even at tree level .",
    "thus , our higgs mass contours should not be taken as strict exclusions , but as illustrating the tension encountered in the mssm between light third generation scalars and a heavy sm - like higgs .",
    "cp - odd couplings in the mssm will generally give rise to electric dipole moments ( edms ) of elementary fermions , nucleons , and neutral atoms . to date , no edm has been experimentally observed , with the most stringent limits having been obtained on the edm of the neutral mercury atom @xcite ( @xmath181 ) , electron ( via the ybf molecule ) @xcite ( @xmath182 ) , and neutron @xcite ( @xmath183 ) .",

    "the dominant contribution to the edm arises from the nuclear schiff moment induced by cp - violating nucleon - nucleon interactions . in general ,",

    "the cp - odd @xmath188 interaction can be induced by the weinberg three - gluon operator , cp - odd four - quark operator , and/or quark chromo - edm operator , though in the mssm the latter contribution typically dominates @xcite .",
    "the computation of the atomic edm , thus , encounters several sources of theoretical uncertainty : the calculation of the cp - violating @xmath188 vertices from the underlying cp - violating interaction ; the computation of the nuclear schiff moment that generally requires a scheme for nuclear model - space truncation ; and the corresponding atomic physics computation of the induced edm .",
    "the computation of the neutron edm is clearly less susceptible to theoretical uncertainties , as only those associated with hadronic effects enter .",
    "nonetheless , these uncertainties can be substantial for both the neutron and atomic edms .",
    "for example , recent work by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite utilizing the qcd sum rule technique suggests that the sensitivity of the neutron edm to quark edm and chomo - edms may be a factor of five smaller than given by earlier work @xcite that provides the basis for the ` cpsuperh ` code . in the case of the nuclear schiff moment contributions to the @xmath187hg edm , the code has yet to take into account state - of - the - art many body computations @xcite that imply substantial differences with the many - body calculations using a simplified , schematic nuclear interaction on which the code is based .",
    "consequently , we caution that the precise numerical results associated with the neutron and @xmath187hg edm constraints given below should be taken with a grain of salt ( we comment more on the impact of this uncertainty on our results below ) . to provide an indication of the kind of theoretical uncertainty one might expect , we show in fig .",

    "the qcd sum rule computations tend to give the largest edm , leading to the strongest constraints .    with these caveats in mind , we observe that the strongest constraint for stop sources comes from the mercury edm , for which , in turn , the quark chromo - edms provide the most important contribution as shown in fig .",

    "note that since the primary constraint on stau sources is the electron edm , the available parameter space is rather insensitive to the theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath193 : an order of magnitude _",
    "under_-estimate of the mercury edm would make its constraints comparable to that of the electron edm .",
    "this picture holds even for smaller values of the cp - violating phase ; we find that one can produce the correct bau and still satisfy the various constraints for @xmath263 in most cases considered .    summarizing the results of figs .",
    "[ fig : stau_sources1]-[fig : stau_sources2 ] , _ we conclude that it is possible to produce the observed baryon asymmetry with cp violation in the stau sector only , for nearly degenerate staus and @xmath264 gev @xmath265 tev , depending on the magnitudes of the stau triscalar coupling and @xmath5 , while satisfying edm and direct search constraints .",
    "this scenario can also naturally accommodate an sm - like higgs mass @xmath259 gev for heavy squarks , or possibly a strongly first order phase transition via the light stop scenario for light @xmath172 .",
    "_ should future searches for electron , neutron , and mercury edms yield null results , all scalar sources in the mssm will be ruled out for resonant ewb .",
    "the exploration of the electroweak scale is closing in on supersymmetric models in which the baryon asymmetry is produced at the electroweak phase transition . in this study , we have focused on the possibility that the cp violation necessary for successful ewb is found in the third generation sfermion sector , a scenario considered only for stops in the past .",
    "here we have studied , for the first time , cp violation in the third generation _ down - type _ sfermion sector , i.e. sbottoms and staus , as a source relevant for baryogenesis .",
    "also , we have quantitatively addressed the question of whether or not sfermionic cp violating sources are compatible with current constraints on the size of the electron , neutron and atomic electric dipole moments .",
    "* neither the stop nor the sbottom sector are viable options to account for the bulk of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe : two - loop barr - zee diagrams contribute to the chromo - edm of the down quark to a level that is ruled out by current constraints of the mercury edm across the entirety of the parameter space where stop or sbottom sources could source a large enough amount of baryon asymmetry",
    ". moreover , stop- and/or sbottom - mediated ewbg is disfavored by indications of @xmath175 gev , though present higgs search constraints on the cp - violating sources are not nearly as decisive as those arising from edms . *",
    "the stau sector ( where no chromo - edms are produced ) has milder constraints from edms , and hence can be responsible for producing the net left - handed chiral charge density needed to produce , via weak sphaleron transitions , the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "it is also possible in this case to achieve @xmath175 gev or a light rh stop as needed for a strong first order phase transition , but not both . due to the relatively small stau thermal widths ,",
    "however , this scenario of `` slepton - mediated '' electroweak baryogenesis requires almost degenerate staus , with masses between 300 gev and 1.2 tev , depending on the size of the stau triscalar coupling and @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario also requires large values of @xmath0 .    while , from the standpoint of requiring a strongly first order phase transition , electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm is being conclusively tested by ongoing searches for a light stop and the higgs @xcite , the present results provide important , complementary information on the nature of the new sources of cp violation , the second key ingredient for successful supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "future results from the lhc and from the next generation of edm searches are therefore expected to yield an increasingly sharper , if not definitively clear , picture of whether or not the electroweak scale is related to the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry .",
