    "many authors have investigated the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetimes ( for a thorough in - depth review see ref . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "these investigations came in an endeavor to understand the origin of the universe and the creation of matter , presumably , out of an arbitrary state of nothing ( the vacuum ) .",
    "the subject was initiated by the discovery of penzias and wilson [ 2]of the microwave background radiation , where it was observed that the galaxies swim in a global cold bath at about @xmath0k .",
    "the source of this radiation was found to be cosmic ; therefore , it was called the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "this radiation was found to be isotropic over large angular scale of observation , and that it has a planck spectrum for a radiating black body at about @xmath0k .",
    "the discovery of the cmb revived the theory of the hot origin of the universe ( the big - bang model ) which was worked out in the late 1940 s by gamow and his collaborators .",
    "the most refined analysis along this line predicted a cosmic background radiation at a temperature about @xmath1k ( for a concise recent review of the subject see ref . [",
    "therefore the penzias and wilson discovery was considered a good verification of what was called the big bang model . however , since the gamow model started with the universe at the times when the temperature was about @xmath2k , the new interest in the origin of the universe sought much earlier times at much higher temperatures .",
    "the new interest arose in studying the state of the universe in the period from near the planck time ( @xmath3 ) to the grand unification time ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is the era when quantum effects played a decisive role in the subsequent developments of the universe , and it is also the era when particle processes could have left permanent imprints on the content of the universe .    the works dealing with this question started by mid 1970 s when matter fields where brought into connection with spacetime curvature through the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5  [ 4 - 8].the motivations for studying this quantity stems from the fact that @xmath6 is a local quantity that can be defined at a specific spacetime point , contrary to the particle concept which is global .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor also acts as a source of gravity in the einstein field equations , therefore @xmath7 plays an important role in any attempt to model a self - consistent dynamics involving the classical gravitational field coupled to the quantized matter fields .",
    "so , once @xmath7 is calculated in a specified background geometry , we can substitute it on the rhs of the einstein field equation and demand self consistency , i.e @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ricci tensor , @xmath10 is the metric tensor and @xmath11 is the scalar curvature .",
    "the solution of ( [ q1 ] ) will determine the development of the spacetime in presence of the given matter field , for which @xmath12 can be unambiguously defined .",
    "this is known as the  back - reaction problem  .",
    "it is interesting to perform the calculation of @xmath7 in friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) models because the real universe is , more or less , a sophisticated form of the friedman models .",
    "however the time - dependence of the spacetime metric generally creates unsolvable fundamental problems .",
    "one such a problem was the definition of vacuum in a time - dependent background [ 9 ] ; a time - dependent background is eligible for producing particles continuously , therefore , pure vacuum states in the minkowskian sence do not exist .",
    "also an investigation into the thermodynamics of a time - dependent systems lacks the proper definition of thermal equilibrium , which is a basic necessity for studying finite - temperature field theory in curved backgrounds.[10 ] .",
    "of all the available solutions of the einstein field equations , the static einstein universe stands the above two funamental challenges .",
    "first , being static , the einstein universe leaves no ambiguity in defining the vacuum both locally and globally [ 1 ] .",
    "the same feature also allows for thermal equilibrium to be defined unambiguously .",
    "furthermore , the einsein static metric is conformal to all robertson - walker metrics , and it was shown by kennedy [ 10 ] that thermal green functions for the static einstein universe and the time - dependent robertson - walker universe are coformally related , hence deducing a ( 1 - 1 ) correspondance between the vacuum and the many particle states of both universes .",
    "so that , under the equilibrium condition , the thermodynamics of quantum fields in an einstein universe of radius @xmath13 is equivalent to that of an instantaneously static friedman - roberson - walker ( frw ) universe of equal radius [ 4,7,11 ] .",
    "this means that the results obtained in frw universe would be qualitatively the same as those obtained in an einstein universe .",
    "dowker and critchley [ 12 ] considered the finite temperature corrections for the massless scalar field in an einstein universe using the technique of finite - temperature green s functions .",
    "later altaie and dowker [ 13 ] calculated the finite temperature corrections to the massless scalar field , the neutrino field and , the photon field in the background of an einstein universe .",
    "the results of the calculation for the photon field was used to deduce a self - consistent solution for the einstein field equation , i.e , a back - reaction problem , from which a relation between the temperature and the radius of the einstein universe was deduced .",
    "however , this relation was not fully exploited at that time and therefore some of the thermodynamical aspects were kept unexposed .",
    "hu [ 11 ] considered the effects of finite - temperature comformally coupled massless scalar field in a closed robertson - walker universe using the results of altaie and dowker [ 13 ] , and assuming that the thermal equilibrium is established for the scalar particles throughout the history of the universe . in the high - temperature limit",
    "hu found that the universe expands linearly in cosmic time near the singularity . in the low - temperature limit",
    ", it reduces to the starobinsky - de sitter type solution where the singularity is avoided in an exponential expansion , concluding that the finite - temperature formalism provides a unifying framework for the description of the interplay of vacuum and radiation energy and their combined effect on the state of the early universe .",
    "recently plunien et al [ 14 ] considered the dynamical casimir effect at finite temperature .",
    "they reported that finite temperatures can enhance the pure vacuum effect by several orders of magnitude .",
    "although the relevance of this result was addressed in the context of an effort aiming at the experimental verification of the casimir effect , it does have a useful implication in respect of the theoretical understanding of the finite temperature corrections to the vacuum energy density in closed spacetimes .    in this letter",
    "we will reconsider the calculation of the back - reaction effect of the conformally coupled massless scalar field and the photon field in the background of the einstein static universe .",
    "the aim is to expose the thermal behavior of the system , analyze and interpret details that may have been overlooked in previous studies , and investigate the possibility of assigning any practical applicability of the results .",
    "_  _ the metric of the einstein static universe is given by @xmath14 \\",
    ", ,   \\label{q2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the radius of the spatial part of the universe @xmath15 and , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we consider an einstein static universe being filled with a massless boson gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the total energy density of the system can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the zero - temperature vacuum energy density and @xmath22is the corrections for finite temperatures , i.e. ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the eigen energies and degeneracies of the @xmath26th state , and @xmath27=@xmath28 is the volume of the spatial section of the einstein universe .    to investigate the back - reaction effect of finite - temperature quantum fields on the behavior of the spacetime we should substitute for @xmath29 on the rhs of the einstein field , but this time with the cosmological constant @xmath30 , i.e.    @xmath31    in order to eliminate @xmath30 from ( [ q5 ] )",
    "we multiply both sides with @xmath10 and sum over @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then using the fact that @xmath34 for massless fields , and for the einstein universe @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , we get    @xmath38      for a conformally coupled massless scalar field the zero - temperature vacuum energy density in an einstein universe is [ 4,6 ]    @xmath39    the eigen - energies and degeneracies are @xmath40 and @xmath41 resectively , so that ( [ q3 ] ) gives    @xmath42    using this mode - sum expression , altaie and dowker [ 13 ] calculated the finite temperature corrections for the vacuum energy density of the conformally coupled massless scalar field in the einstein universe .",
    "the results which are functions of a single parameter @xmath43 , were then subjected to the high and low - temperature limits .",
    "it was found that in the low - temperature ( or small radius ) limit the zero - temperature vacuum energy density is recovered , i.e    @xmath44    and in the high - temperature ( or large radius ) limit the behavior of the system is totally planckian ,    @xmath45    in order to investigate the back - reaction effect of the field we substitute for @xmath29 from ( [ q8 ] ) in ( [ q6 ] ) and request a self - consistent solution , we get    @xmath46    this equation determines a relation between the temperature @xmath19 and the radius @xmath13 of the einstein universe in presence of the conformally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "the solutions of this equation are shown in fig .",
    "1.two regimes are recognized : one corresponding to small values of @xmath47 where the temperature rises sharply reaching a maximum at @xmath48k at a radius @xmath49 .",
    "since this regime is controlled by the vacuum energy ( the casimir energy ) , therefore we prefer to call it the  casimir regime  .",
    "the second regime is what we call the  planck regime  , which correspond to large values of @xmath47 , and in which the temperature asymptotically approaches zero for very large values of @xmath13 .",
    "this behavior was over looked by hu [ 11 ] .    from ( [ q11 ] )",
    "it is clear that at @xmath50 the radius of an einstein universe has a minimum value @xmath51 , below which no consistent solution of the einstein field equation exist .",
    "this is given by    @xmath52    from ( [ q6 ] ) and ( [ q10 ] ) we can calculate the background ( tolman ) temperature of the universe in the limit of large radius .",
    "this is given by    @xmath53    for example , at @xmath54 we obtain @xmath55k .",
    "conversily if we demand that the background temperature be the presently measured value of @xmath0k , the radius of the universe should be @xmath56 .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude larger than the estimated hubble length of @xmath57 .",
    "the vacuum energy density of this field at zero temperature is given by [ 6 ]    @xmath58    the total energy density of the system in terms of the mode - sum can be written as    @xmath59    in the low - temperature limit the result reduce to [ 13 ]    @xmath60    substituting this in ( [ q6 ] ) we get    @xmath61    this is the minimum radius for an einstein static universe filled with photons at finite temperatures .    in the high temperature ( or large radius )",
    "limit the result is    @xmath62    the back - reaction of the field can be studied if we substitue ( [ q15 ] ) in ( [ q6 ] ) where this time we obtain    @xmath63    the solutions of this equation are dipicted in fig .",
    "2 , where we see that the behavior is qualitatively the same as that encountered in the conformally coupled scalar field case . the minimum radius permissable for a self - consistent solution to exist in presence of the photon field is @xmath64 and the maximum temperature @xmath65 k at @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "the background ( tolman ) temperature of the photon field is    @xmath68    at the radius of @xmath57 we obtain a background temperature of @xmath69 k , and if we require that the background temperature to be the same as the avarage measured value of @xmath0 k , the radius of the eistein universe has to be @xmath70 .",
    "again more than two orders of magnitude larger than the estimated value of hubble length .",
    "_  _ in an earlier work [ 15 ] , we studied the bec of non - relativistic spin 0 and spin 1 particles in an einstein universe .",
    "we found that the finiteness of the system resulted in smoothing - out the singularities of the thermodynamic functions which are normally found in infinite systems , so that the phase transitions in curved space becomes non - critical .",
    "we also remarked the enhancement of the condensate fraction and the displacement of the specific - heat maximum toward higher temperatures .",
    "singh and pathria [ 16 ] considered the bec of a relativistic conformally coupled massive scalar field .",
    "their results confirmed our earlier findings of the non - relativistic case .",
    "recently [ 17 ] we considered the bec of the relativistic massive spin-1 field in an einstein universe .",
    "again the resuls confirmed our earlier findings concerning the general features of the bec in closed spacetimes .",
    "so the above mentioned features became an established general features of the bec of quantum fields in curved spaces .",
    "parker and zhang [ 18 ] , considered the ultra - relativistic bec of the minimally coupled massive scalar field in an einstein universe in the limit of high temperatures .",
    "they showed , among other things , that ultra - relativistic bec can occur at very high temperature and densities in the einstein universe , and by implication in the early stages of a dynamically changing universe .",
    "parker and zhang [ 19 ] , also showed that the bose - einstein condensate can act as a source for inflation leading to a de - sitter type universe .",
    "however , parker and zhang gave no specific value for the condensation temperature of the system .",
    "here we are going to use the ready result obtained for the condensation temperature @xmath71 of the conformally coupled massless scalar field in order to explain the change of behavior of the system from the casimir ( vacuum dominated ) regime to the planck ( radiation dominated ) regime .",
    "this change wich is taking place at a well defined maximum temperature which we called the transition temperature @xmath72 .",
    "the condensation temperature of the conformally coupled massive scalar field is given by[16,20 ]    @xmath73    in the massless limit this gives    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the number density of the particles .",
    "for the einstein universe specifically we have shown that ( see eq .",
    "[ q6 ] )    @xmath76    this means that , if the back - reaction of the field is to be taken into consideration , the number density of the particles in the system @xmath75 will be inversely proportional to @xmath77 , this enable us to write    @xmath78    for any values of @xmath75 and @xmath13 .",
    "this means that @xmath79    substituting this in ( [ q22 ] ) we get the expression for the condensation temperature of the conformally coupled massless scalar field in einstein universe as    @xmath80    the estimated upper bound on the net average particle number density of the universe at present is @xmath81 ( see dolgov and zeldovich [ 21 ] ) .",
    "if this upper bound is adopted , then using ( [ q26 ] ) we can calculate the condensation temperature of the conformally coupled field at any specified radius .",
    "if we substitue for the radius of the einstein universe the estimated value of hubble length , i.e @xmath82 , then we can write    @xmath83    we have already found that the transition from the casimir ( vacuum ) regime to the planck ( radiation ) regime takes place at @xmath84 @xmath85 . substituting this in ( [ q27 ] )",
    "we get    @xmath86    clearly we obtain a condensation temperature which is the same order of magnitude as the transition temperature obtained earlier for the conformally coupled massless scalar particles .",
    "this strongly suggests that the transition from the casimir ( vacuum ) regime into the planck regime is taking place as a result of bose - einstein condensation of the vacuum energy so that as the condensate is formed a free absorbsion and emission of massless quanta by the condensate is expected to take place and the system will start behaving according to planck law .",
    "in conclusion we can say that the present study exhibited some features of the thermodynamical behavior of the einstein universe .",
    "the main finding are    \\1 .",
    "the thermal development of the universe is a direct consequence of the state of its global curvature .",
    "the universe avoids the singularity at @xmath50 through quantum effects ( the casimir effect ) because of the non - zero value of @xmath21 .",
    "a non - zero expectation value of the vacuum energy density always implies a symmetry breaking event .",
    "\\3 . during the casimir regime",
    "the universe is totally controlled by vacuum and this region represent the vacuum era .",
    "the energy content of the universe is a function of its radius . using the conformal relation between the static einstein universe and the closed frw universe [ 10 ] ,",
    "this result indicates that in a frw  model there would be a continuous creation of energy out of vacuum as long as the universe is expanding , a result which is confirmed by parker long ago [ 22 ] .",
    "the steep , nearly vertical line in fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "suggests that the universe started violently and had to relax later .",
    "\\4 . at high temperatures",
    "a new quantum - thermal effects do interfere causing a phase transition at about @xmath87k for the massless scalar field , and at @xmath88 k for the photon field .",
    "the calculations show that a bose - einstein condensation of massless quanta ( at least in the scalar field case ) may be responsible for the transition .",
    "the values of these peaks agrees with the expectations of particle physics in respect to the the era of total unification of forces .",
    "the recent findings of plunien etal [ 14 ] that finite temperatures can enhance the pure vacuum effect by several orders of magnitude , can be used to explain the behavior of our system during the casimir ( vacuum ) regime . since this means that the finite temperature corrections will surely enhance the positive vacuum energy density of our closed system causing the system to behave , thermodynamically , as being controlled by the vacuum energy .",
    "so , one can confidently assume that the original massless particles that existed during the casimir regime are basically those which where borne out of vacuum through the mechanism of the casimir effect plus the finite temperature enhancement deduced by plunien etal . indeed a similar behavior to the case of dynamical casimir effect inside a resonantly vibrating cavity presented by plunien etal is obresved here where the number of particles increases all the time .",
    "this interpretation , i.e , the finite - temperature enhansement of the casimir energy explain , physically , the behavior of quantum fields at finite temperatures during the casimir regime .",
