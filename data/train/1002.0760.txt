    "the correlation between the masses of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) with the global characteristics of their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is crucial for our interpretation of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "m@xmath1 is usually determined using dynamical tracers such as a disk of gas clouds in keplerian rotation around the smbh or the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) of stars .",
    "both methods require observations of high spatial resolution since the dynamical models have to be constrained by resolved kinematics which probe the sphere of gravitational influence of the smbh ( r@xmath2 ) , defined as the distance from smbh at which the potential of the galaxy and smbh are approximately equal .",
    "this spatial scale , usually defined as r@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , is typically significantly less than an arcsec in apparent size , even for nearby galaxies .",
    "the influence of the smbh , however , will be felt at larger radii than r@xmath5 , albeit to a lessening degree . here",
    "we show that it is possible to constrain the m@xmath1 when r@xmath5 is up to 3 times smaller than the spatial resolution of the observations if the observation consists of _",
    "( i ) _ low ( arcsec ) spatial resolution integral field data covering the galaxy out to about 1 effective radius required to determine the overall dynamical mass - to - light ratio of the system , _",
    "( ii ) _ high ( sub - arcsec ) resolution integral field data probing the stellar kinematics in the vicinity of the smbh and have _ ( iii ) _ sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to extract higher order moments of the losvd .",
    "in this report we summarise the results of @xcite which present the usage of a new observational method with lgs ao system especially suitable for determination of m@xmath1 in the nuclei of nearby low mass early - type galaxies . for determination of m@xmath1 in massive early - type galaxies using similar method , but non - ao observations see the contribution of @xcite in this proceedings .",
    "the main prohibitive issue with ao observations is that , even with lgs capabilities , a natural guide star is required for an optimal correction of atmospheric aberrations and there are only a handful of galaxies with a near - resolvable r@xmath2 that have a suitable guide star .",
    "this limitation has prompted innovative use of ao techniques , such as neglecting altogether the low - order corrections provided by the natural tip - tilt @xcite . in this study",
    ", we employ a novel method developed at gemini observatory for altair lgs ao system .      to avoid the issue of suitable guide stars , it is , in principle , also possible to use the nucleus of the galaxy as a natural guide source for the system , provided it is sufficiently bright and compact ( drop of @xmath6 magnitude within the central @xmath7 arcsec for altair ) .",
    "the central light profiles of early - type galaxies show a general change from steeply rising ` cusp ' profiles at lower masses , towards a flatter central profile that can define a central ` core ' region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to test what correction of the psf could be expected for typical early - type galaxies , we chose ngc524 and ngc2549 which both satisfy the basic altair requirement for nuclear guiding .",
    "specifically , ngc524 has a core - like light profile , while ngc2549 a cusp - like profile at the hst resolution . in this proceeding",
    "we will consider the observations of ngc2549 only , the smaller of the two galaxies .",
    "after initial observations were attempted , it became clear that the chosen nuclei , while suitable for tip - tilt correction , are too faint to be used for constraining the focus .",
    "gemini staff implemented a procedure by which the focus correction during the science integration is controlled by a geometric function that takes into account the change in the distance to the sodium layer as the telescope position changes . in this , so - called ` open - loop ' focus model , the only time - dependent parameter is the altitude of the sodium layer , which is determined immediately before observing the galaxy by ` tuning ' the lgs ao system using a nearby bright star .",
    "when all the control loops of the system ( tip - tilt , focus , and lgs ) have converged with this reference source , the loops are opened and the science target is acquired .",
    "the tip - tilt and lgs control loops are then closed , using the galaxy nucleus and laser beacon respectively as reference sources .",
    "the focus loop is left open , being passively controlled by the open - loop model . after approximately one hour of science observations ,",
    "the bright reference star is re - observed , so that the degradation of the psf can be estimated ( our tests show minimal degradation ) and the lgs ao system can be re - optimised for further observations .",
    "schwarzschild dynamical models and the determination of the best fitting parameters for ngc2549 .",
    "each symbol is a dynamical model .",
    "the agreement between the data and the models are described by overploted contours @xmath8 contours showing 1 , 2 and 3@xmath4 levels for two parameters .",

    "we estimated the psf of the science observations by convolving ( with a double gaussian ) and rebining ( to the pixel size of our observations ) an hst / wfpc2 image .",
    "this image is compared with the reconstructed image of our observations , and the parameters of the psf are varied until the best matching double - gaussian is found .",
    "the final psf of our lgs ao observations was : 0.17 and 0.80 arcsecs ( fwhm ) for the the narrow and broad gaussian components and intensities of 0.53 and 0.47 , respectively .",
    "comparison between data and model velocity dispersion maps for ngc2549 . from left to right : @xmath4 ( symmetrised ) and model prediction maps for different m@xmath1 ( at the best fitting m / l ) .",
    "the best fitting model is shown in the map adjacent to the observed @xmath4 map , followed by a model with a too small m@xmath1 and a model with too large m@xmath1 .",
    "the models were constrained using both sauron and nifs data .",

    "we spatially binned the data using voronoi method @xcite and achieved the sn of @xmath9 , while within the central arcsec the bins are no larger than @xmath10 arcsecs .",
    "we extracted stellar kinematics using the ppxf method @xcite .",

    "it is evident that when using only sauron data it is not possible to determine the lower limit of the m@xmath1 , simply because the resolution of the sauron data is 1.7 arcsec , while r@xmath2=0.05 arcsec , using the above best fit model . using the nifs dataset only it seems possible to determine even the lower limit , in spite of 0.17 arcsec resolution , but",
    "the uncertainty on m@xmath1 is very large because , due to the small field - of - view , nifs data alone are not able to constrain the total orbital distribution and give the right mass - to - light ratio . these are , however , well constrained using sauron large field - of - view ( fov ) observations . combining the two data sets , the high resolution and large fov",
