    "let @xmath7 be the random variable corresponding to projection onto the @xmath8-th factor .",
    "so if @xmath9 is a sample path , @xmath10 is the location of the path at time @xmath8 , and the distribution of @xmath7 is given by the @xmath8-fold convolution of @xmath2 with itself , which we shall write @xmath11 .",
    "we say that the random walk has a linear rate of escape if the limit @xmath12 exists for almost all sample paths @xmath9 , and @xmath13 is strictly greater than zero almost surely . here",

    "kesten @xcite and day @xcite showed that an irreducible random walk on a non - amenable group has a linear rate of escape , assuming the random walk has finite first moment , i.e. the expected value of the distance the random walk moves in one step is finite .",
    "the mapping class group contains non - abelian free subgroups , so in particular is non - amenable .",
    "therefore a random walk on the mapping class group makes linear progress in the word metric on the group .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite show that there is a relative metric on the mapping class group , under which the group is quasi - isometric to the complex of curves . a relative",
    "metric is a word metric on the group with respect to an infinite generating set , consisting of a finite generating set , union a finite collection of subgroups . in this case",
    ", the collection of subgroups consists of stabilizers of simple closed curves @xmath16 , where the @xmath16 consist of representatives for orbits of simple closed curves under the action of the mapping class group .",
    "the complex of curves is a simplicial complex whose vertices are isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves , and whose simplices are spanned by disjoint collections of simple closed curves .",
    "the quasi - isometry may be explicitly described by choosing a basepoint @xmath17 for the complex of curves , and sending @xmath15 to @xmath18 .",
    "we will write @xmath19 for the length of the group element @xmath15 in the relative metric on @xmath1 , and this is coarsely equivalent to the distance @xmath15 moves the basepoint in the complex of curves . in this paper",
    "we show that a random walk in the mapping class group makes linear progress in the relative metric .",
    "let @xmath1 be the mapping class group of an orientable surface of finite type , which is not a sphere with three or fewer punctures , and consider the random walk generated by a probability distribution @xmath2 whose support is bounded in the relative metric , which generates a non - elementary subgroup of the mapping class group and which has finite first moment .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21 almost surely .",
    "the relative metric is an improper metric on the mapping class group , and therefore not quasi - isometric to the word metric , so linear progress in the word metric does not immediately imply linear progress in the relative metric .",
    "we will begin with a brief discussion of the mapping class group of the torus , as in this case it is easy to see that the result holds .",
    "the mapping class group of the torus is isomorphic to the group @xmath22 .",
    "as there are no non - parallel disjoint essential simple closed curves on the torus , the curve complex for the torus is usually defined to have edges connecting pairs of curves that intersect exactly once .",
    "the curve complex for the torus is the farey triangulation of the unit disc , and @xmath22 with its word metric is quasi - isometric to the dual graph , which is a trivalent tree .",
    "this is illustrated below in figure [ picture18 ] .    for simplicity",
    ", consider a non - backtracking random walk on the trivalent tree .",
    "such a path may be described by a sequence lrllrl ",
    ", where an l denotes a left turn at a vertex , and an r denotes a right turn at a vertex .",
    "such a path makes uniform progress in the trivalent graph .",
    "the path travels distance one in the relative space whenever the next letter in the sequence is different from the previous one , and this occurs with probability one - half .",
    "so the random walk makes progress in the relative space on average at half the rate it makes progress in the trivalent tree .",
    "we now indicate the argument we use for more complicated mapping class groups .",
    "imagine starting at a basepoint @xmath17 in hyperbolic space , and travelling some large distance @xmath23 .",
    "the set of points you may arrive at is given by a sphere centered at @xmath17 .",
    "now travel another large distance @xmath24 , as illustrated below in figure [ picture19 ] .",
    "due to negative curvature , nearly all the volume of the second sphere of radius @xmath24 lies outside the sphere of radius @xmath23 .",
    "we wish to translate this intuition into our setting .",
    "our space is the mapping class group @xmath1 with a relative metric , which we shall denote @xmath25 , which is quasi - isometric to the complex of curves .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite showed that this space is a ( non - proper ) @xmath26-hyperbolic space , and klarreich @xcite identified the gromov boundary of the space as the space of foliations in @xmath27 which contain no closed trajectories .",
    "let @xmath2 be a probability distribution on @xmath1 , whose support generates a non - elementary subgroup .",
    "kaimanovich and masur showed that for the random walk determined by @xmath2 , almost all sample paths converge to uniquely ergodic , and hence minimal , foliations and this defines a harmonic measure @xmath28 on the boundary , where @xmath29 is the probability that a sample path converges to a foliation contained in the set @xmath30 . the harmonic measure @xmath28 governs the long time behaviour of the sample paths , and is the weak-@xmath31 limit of the @xmath8-fold convolutions of @xmath2 on @xmath25 union its boundary .",
    "in particular , if we start at the identity and consider all sample paths of length @xmath23 , for @xmath23 large , the distribution of endpoints looks similar to @xmath28 , at least when viewed from the identity .",
    "if we now continue the random walk for another @xmath24 steps , negative curvature leads us to expect that most of the new sample points will lie a definite distance further away from the origin .    in order to make this intuition precise",
    ", we need some way of comparing the harmonic measure @xmath28 with the convolution measures @xmath11 .",
    "we will compare the measures on sets which are _",
    "a halfspace @xmath32 consists of all points closer ( in @xmath25 ) to @xmath33 than @xmath34 , and we will be most interested in halfspaces @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the identity element in @xmath1 . in section [ section : decay ] we will show that the harmonic measure of a halfspace @xmath35 decays exponentially in @xmath37 , i.e. there is a constant @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , for all @xmath34 sufficiently far from @xmath36 , where @xmath40 is the closure of @xmath35 .",

    "first observe that there is some number @xmath43 such that the harmonic measure of all halfspaces @xmath35 , with @xmath44 is bounded away from @xmath36 , at most @xmath45 , say . then given a halfspace @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is large",
    ", one may construct a nested sequence of half spaces @xmath48 .",
    "the number of such halfspaces is linear in @xmath49 , and furthermore , we may assume that the distance between any point in @xmath50 and any point in the complement of @xmath51 is larger than @xmath43 .",
    "the conditional probability that a sample path converges into @xmath50 , given that it hits a point in the complement of @xmath51 is at most @xmath45 , so the harmonic measure of the innermost halfspace is at most @xmath52 . in order to bound @xmath11 in terms of @xmath28 , suppose",
    "a large amount of the mass of @xmath11 is contained in @xmath50 , then at most @xmath53 of the mass can escape back out in to the complement of @xmath51 , so this gives the upper bound for @xmath11 .",
    "we will use the estimates described above to find a positive lower bound on the expected extra distance from @xmath36 obtained by taking an extra @xmath54 steps , after a random walk of length @xmath8 , for @xmath54 sufficiently large , i.e. we will show @xmath55 .",
    "therefore @xmath56 , so the expected distance from the identity grows linearly , and a standard application of kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem @xcite shows that this will then be true for almost all sample paths as well .",
    "we remark that there are distance non - increasing maps to the relative space from other useful spaces on which the mapping class group acts , such as teichmller space and the pants complex , so linear progress in the complex of curves implies linear progress in these spaces too .",
    "in particular , work of duchin @xcite , shows that linear progress in teichmller space implies that for almost all sample paths there is a geodesic which the random walk tracks sublinearly , at least for the parts of the geodesic in the thick part of teichmller space .    in section",
    "[ section : preliminaries ] , we recall some standard definitions and set up some notation . in section [ section : halfspaces ] we prove some useful results about halfspaces in non - proper @xmath26-hyperbolic metric spaces . as we do not assume that @xmath2 is symmetric , it will be convenient for us to know that a semi - group in the mapping class group contains a pair of independent elements , if and only if it generates a non - elementary subgroup , and we show this in section [ section : semigroups ] , in a straight forward extension of some results of ivanov @xcite . in section [ section : decay ]",
    "we show that the harmonic measure of halfspaces in the relative space decays exponentially in the distance of the halfspace from the basepoint , and obtain the estimate for the convolution measures .",
    "finally in section [ section : linear progress ] we find a positive lower bound for the expected difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and then apply kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem to show that a random walk makes linear progress in the relative space .",
