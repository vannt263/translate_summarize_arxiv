    "full jet reconstruction reduces the uncertainties due to fragmentation of partons into hadrons that are present in di - hadron correlation studies .",
    "non - perturbative fragmentation processes result in an approximately gaussian jet cone .",
    "the transverse shape of a jet is characterized by = @xmath3 , the hadron momentum component perpendicular to the jet thrust axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : jt ] shows that    measured  distributions in p+p collisions agree well with pythia which accurately describes jet features at other energies . for jets with @xmath011 gev , star measured = 515@xmath450 mev / c .",

    "experiments also reported the measurements of , or the transverse momentum of an individual parton within a nucleon ( @xmath6 ) or nucleus ( @xmath7 ) , inferred from the acoplanarity in the dijet production ( away - side @xmath5 distribution ) .",
    "non - zero values of  in hadronic collisions are usually attributed to the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial state partons due to the finite size of the incoming hadron and to multiple soft - gluon emission by the partons prior to the hard scattering .",

    "figure  [ fig : kt ] ( left ) shows the dijet @xmath5 distribution in p+p and d+au collisions measured by star at @xmath8=200 gev , for jets of energy on the order of @xmath0 13 gev .",

    "taking @xmath9=@xmath10+@xmath11 indicates a finite value for @xmath7 .",
    "phenix @xcite reported systematic measurements of di - hadron correlations in p+p and d+au collisions as a function of trigger and associated hadron  ( fig .",

    "the rms value of the two - dimensional per - parton vector @xmath13 used by star is related to @xmath14 reported by phenix as @xmath15 . whereas star and phenix measurements of @xmath6 are consistent with each other and the world data systematics as a function of @xmath8 , within current statistical and systematic uncertainties it is too early to conclude about possible discrepancies in the measurements of @xmath7 .",
    "phenix @xcite also extracted  from the di - hadron azimuthal distributions in au+au data for @xmath16=2.5 - 4.0 gev / c and @xmath17=1.0 - 2.5 gev / c .",
    "they report a dramatic increase of  with centrality .",
    "interpretation of this result , however , is not straightforward .",
    "strong suppression of away - side jets and large values of elliptic flow measured at rhic complicate the analysis of di - hadron azimuthal correlations in au+au data .",
    "higher statistics and larger -scales are needed to effectively decouple the jet and elliptic flow contributions to the di - hadron distributions .",
    "the -range of single inclusive hadron spectra measured at rhic has become truly remarkable , reaching = 10 - 15 gev / c .",
    "since the bulk of the data on inclusive spectra in p+p , d+au and au+au collisions has already been published , i will not review these results .",
    "significant new measurements of hard photons and heavy quarks have been presented at this conference .",
    "direct photon ( phenix ) and open charm ( star ) measurements in d+au collisions extend up to = 11 gev / c and are reviewed by r. averbeck @xcite .",
    "one of the important new results regarding spectra was shown by phenix @xcite .",
    "new data on the nuclear modification factor , the ratio of central and peripheral d+au spectra normalized by the number of binary collisions , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "it was previously observed that in d+au collisions , nuclear effects are significant ( nuclear modification factor exceeds unity , manifestation of `` cronin '' enhancement ) in the region of = 2 - 7 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the new phenix data extend up to = 12 - 15 gev / c and for @xmath186 - 8 gev / c the yields scale with the number of binary collisions , consistent with no significant initial state nuclear effects for high transverse momentum hadrons produced at midrapidity .",
    "= 200 gev .",
    "[ fig : spectra],width=377,height=226 ]    phenix also presented detailed centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor in d+au and au+au collisions for charged hadrons and neutral pions , with the latter extending to 15 gev / c in au+au @xcite , as well as for @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . in peripheral collisions",
    "the particle yields are consistent with binary scaling for both colliding systems .",
    "going from peripheral to central collisions , progressive enhancement of particle production in d+au collisions is seen , in contrast to stronger suppression for au+au collisions .",
    "this strong centrality dependence in d+au differs , however , from the star observations of weak to no centrality dependence of binary - scaled hadron yields @xcite .",
    "the flavor dependence of the cronin effect in d+au collisions is shown to be not large enough to explain the @xmath21 ratio measured in au+au collisions .",
    "star data @xcite on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 production in au+au collisions demonstrate that the difference is due to a baryon / meson effect and seems to be confined to the region of = 2 - 6 gev / c .",
    "identified hadron jet studies in au+au collisions may be able to probe the energy loss difference of quarks versus gluons as well as possible modifications in flavor composition and multiplicities in a jet due to coalescence / recombination in the medium .",
    "several aspects of particle production in central au+au collisions at rhic in the -range of 2 - 6 gev / c are incompatible with jet fragmentation in simpler systems : large @xmath21 ratio @xcite , antibaryon to baryon ratio constant with  @xcite , different suppression of proton / pion @xcite and lambda / kaon yields @xcite , and deviation from hydrodynamic mass - ordering in strength of elliptic flow of pions / protons @xcite and kaons / lambdas @xcite .",
    "models based on coalescence of thermal partons are successful in qualitatively describing the features observed in the data @xcite .    on the other hand , new data on the relative azimuthal distributions of identified baryons and mesons ( phenix @xcite ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( star @xcite ) with @xmath242.5 gev / c and charged particles show finite jet - like correlations .",
    "star finds that @xmath1 and @xmath25 correlations with charged hadrons in central au+au collisions have different trigger  dependences .",
    "phenix results on the centrality dependence of associated particle yields per identified trigger are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barmes ] .",
    "no significant change in yield on the near - side , or decrease expected in a naive coalescence picture , is observed as a function of the number of participants . on the away - side , an overall decrease in the yields is observed similar to back - to - back suppression of charged particles @xcite .",
    "the data perhaps indicate slightly larger yields on the away side for the baryon triggers .",
    "the tendencies shown in the data are quite indecisive at this point ; significantly higher  probes are required to clarify the observations .",
    "it will be interesting to apply asymmetric  thresholds for baryons and mesons ( with the ratio corresponding to the number of constituent quarks ) to test coalescence models .",
    "theoretical progress is also needed to understand whether coalescence / recombination may result in sizable correlations in the azimuthal distributions @xcite .",
    "direct evidence of the variation of the strength of back - to - back suppression with azimuthal orientation of the jets relative to the reaction plane was presented by star @xcite .",
    "di - hadron correlations were measured in non - central au+au collisions at = 200  gev for trigger particles with = 4 - 6 gev / c sorted in the direction of the reaction plane angle ( in - plane ) and perpendicular to it ( out - of - plane ) .",
    "the trigger particles were paired with associated particles with 2  gev@xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : inout ] shows the azimuthal distribution of associated particles in au+au ( elliptic flow subtracted @xcite ) compared with p+p reference data .",
    "the near - side jet - like correlations measured in au+au are similar to those measured in p+p collisions .",
    "the back - to - back correlations measured in au+au collisions for in - plane trigger particles are suppressed compared to p+p , and even more suppressed for the out - of - plane trigger particles . such behavior is naturally predicted by jet quenching models , where the energy loss of a parton depends on the distance traveled through the dense medium @xcite . due to energy loss in these models , the high  trigger biases the initial production point to be near the surface",
    "so the near - side correlations should be similar to those seen in p+p collisions .",
    "the away - side correlations are more suppressed when the trigger hadron is emitted perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "measurements of the effect as a function of centrality will allow to precisely determine the energy loss dependence on the path length .    , width=340 ]    results on single particle high @xmath27 charged hadron ( star @xcite ) and @xmath28 production ( phenix @xcite ) with respect to the reaction plane were also presented .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy , quantified by the second harmonic fourier coefficient @xmath29 , is found to reach its maximum at @xmath303  gev , decreasing very slowly if at all up to @xmath307 - 10 gev / c .",
    "star performed higher order cumulant analysis for @xmath29 and compared azimuthal correlations measured in p+p collisions to those in au+au .",
    "the results confirm strong elliptic flow in mid - central au+au collisions at least up to @xmath31  gev / c , qualitatively consistent with jet quenching .",
    "the strength of the @xmath29 signal remains too large to be explained by quenching alone @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath29 that are free of non - flow effects in the -region which is clearly dominated by jets ( most likely , @xmath32 gev / c ) are highly desirable .",
    "measurements of the redistribution of the energy radiated off high energy partons in the medium would provide a very important cross - check of jet quenching and , perhaps , a means to probe the degree of thermalization . first attempt of such studies was presented by star @xcite .",
    "the analysis involves statistical reconstruction of charged hadrons associated with a high  trigger particle ( @xmath334 - 6 gev / c ) in azimuth and pseudorapidity .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of the associated particles with = 0.15 - 4.0 gev / c with respect to the trigger hadron , after subtraction of the combinatorial background , exhibits jet - like near - angle correlations in p+p and au+au collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fuqi ] , left ) . on the away side ,",
    "the distribution is broad and consistent with a @xmath34 shape , as expected for statistical momentum balance @xcite with no additional dynamical correlations .",
    "the dependence of the correlation magnitude on @xmath16 for central au+au collisions seems to be in agreement with the estimates from momentum conservation , even for @xmath356.5 gev / c @xcite .",
    "this may signal equilibration of the medium - induced gluon radiation with momentum distributed over many particles .",
    "the correlation signals were integrated , and charged hadron multiplicities and   distributions of associated particles within @xmath361.0 and @xmath371.4 ( near - side cone ) and @xmath381.0 ( away - side cone ) of the trigger hadron were studied as a function of centrality in au+au collisions and compared to p+p collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : fuqi ] shows the  distributions of associated particles .",
    "the away side is observed to be depleted at large   and enhanced at low   compared to p+p collisions .",
    "the broad angular distribution and softening of the spectrum may be consistent with predictions of the softening of the hadron - triggered fragmentation function due to parton energy loss and enhancement of soft hadrons from emitted gluons @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in the last year experiments have gained solid ground on elucidating jet properties at rhic .",
    "preliminary results on measurements of jet fragmentation in p+p and d+au collisions provide a baseline for comparison to au+au collisions .",
    "first direct evidence that back - to - back dijet quenching depends on the azimuthal orientation of the jets relative to the reaction plane has been presented .",
    "future high - statistics measurements of flavor - tagged di - hadron correlations will probe energy loss effects of quark versus gluon jets and test string fragmentation versus recombination .",
    "finding the lost remnants of jets may provide a cross - check of the picture of medium induced final - state energy loss .",
    "statistical reconstruction of jets in au+au collisions has shown potential to get an experimental handle on the degree of thermalization at the partonic level .",
    "in general , presented data broadly support pqcd - based models of final - state parton energy loss in a dense qcd medium produced in au+au collisions at rhic and put strong experimental constraints on its properties .",
