    "ibd involves chronic inflammation of the digestive tract and primarily includes ulcerative colitis ( uc ) and crohn s disease .",
    "both are chronic relapsing diseases and are characterized as alternating between a state of remission and being active . over the past few decades ,",
    "the incidence of ibd around the world has risen dramatically @xcite .",
    "traditionally , a colonoscopy is used to identify and confirm bowel inflammation , and is considered to be an accurate diagnostic tool .",
    "the procedure itself is expensive , and limited in parts of the world , and its invasive nature can result in discomfort and adverse effects for patients .",
    "the provision of a cheap and non - invasive diagnostic test would facilitate for early referral and detection of ibd .",
    "faecal calprotectin ( fc ) , a calcium and zinc binding cytosolic protein found in neutrophils @xcite , is a biomarker specific for intestinal inflammation @xcite .",
    "the presence of fc in faeces quantitively relates to neutrophil migration to the gastrointestinal tract , which is why studies have shown increased fc in the stool of patients with ibd .    in healthy individuals ,",
    "the upper limit of fc in faeces is 50 g / g .",
    "two large meta - analyses , of prospective studies in which patients had suspected ibd , found fc to be a very useful marker for diagnosing ibd , and differentiating it from irritable bowel syndrome .",
    "the pooled specificity and sensitivity of fc was shown to be up to 93 % and 96 % respectively @xcite , @xcite . a large retrospective study carried out in edinburgh @xcite corroborated existing data which showed that fc reliably distinguishes between patients with functional disease and ibd .",
    "it also showed that in recent years , fc has been used accurately for young adults ( 16 - 50 years ) to exclude intestinal inflammation , and reduce the need for invasive procedures , as a negative fc would suggest a lack of an organic gi disease and gi inflammation .",
    "older patients still require colonoscopy to exclude colorectal cancer .",
    "commonly used statistical prediction techniques such as linear regression models are not complex enough to produce reliable results as they have poor statistical stability .",
    "hence predicting the frequency of ibd using these traditional predictive models is not accurate .",
    "@xcite artificial neural network ( ann ) is a novel model , inspired by the functioning of the human brain .",
    "it can be used to build non - linear statistical models which can handle complex biological systems , and recently , has been successfully introduced in clinical settings for pattern recognition and survival prediction @xcite .",
    "studies have shown the ann model to outperforms both logistic regression and linear discriminant models , with increased accuracy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new recurrent neural network predictive model based on the echo state network ( esn ) for retrospective fc analysis , which has been benchmarked against a conventional logistic regression model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : section [ section2 ] introduces the calprotectin dataset and the methods used in this study , sections [ section3 ] and [ section4 ] describe the two methods employed , specifically , logistic regression and esn , and also present comparative experimental results and discussions . finally , concluding remarks and future work suggestions are outlined in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the retrospective dataset comprises records of 804 patients , which was provided for this study , by western general hospital s gastro entomology ( gi ) unit .",
    "since the original data was in an unnormalized form , some pre - processing was carried out which led to a selection of 53 independent variables ( out of the available 58 ) .",
    "the objective of this initial case study was to determine the factors predictive of reaching a primary composite end point .",
    "a tenfold cross - validation technique was employed , and the prediction accuracy of the new esn predictor was benchmarked against a conventional logistic regression model .",
    "roc analysis was also carried out to verify the results .",
    "table [ logit ] illustrates the enhanced comparative accuracy of the proposed machine learning approach in demonstrating the predictive effectiveness of selected variables , for reaching the primary composite endpoint .    in machine learning and neural network communities , several neural network models and kernel - based methods",
    "are applied to predictive modeling tasks , such as mlps ( multi - layer perceptrons ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , rbf ( radial basis function ) neural network @xcite , fir ( finite impulse response ) neural network @xcite , svr ( support vector regression ) @xcite , som ( self - organization map ) @xcite , gp ( gaussian process ) echo state machine @xcite , svesm ( support vector echo state machine ) @xcite , rnns ( recurrent neural networks ) including nar ( nonlinear autoregressive network ) @xcite , elman networks @xcite , jordan networks , rpnn ( recurrent predictor neural networks ) @xcite and esn ( echo state network ) @xcite .",
    "logistic regression is a widely used algorithm which frequently appears in medical literature @xcite .",
    "the multivariable method tries to establish a functional relationship between two or more predictor ( independent ) variables and one categorical outcome ( dependent ) variable .",
    "the probability of @xmath0 occurring is predicted given known values of x ( vector containing predictors ) .",
    "the general form of the functional dependence given by the regression could be expressed as per the following formula ( 1 ) : @xmath1 where p(y ) is the probability of y occurring ( or , in other words , of y belonging to a certain class ) , @xmath2 are predictor variables and @xmath3 are coefficients to be determined by the logistic regression algorithm .",
    "the coefficients are estimated by fitting models , based on the available predictors , to the observed data .",
    "thus it can also be defined mathematically by relating the probability of some event , e , occurring , conditional on a vector , @xmath4 , of explanatory variables , to the vector @xmath4 , through the functional form of a logistic edf .",
    "thus @xmath5,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 are ambiguous parameters that are estimated from the data .",
    "logistic regression is always the preferred initial method for describing and testing hypothesis relating to relationships between a categorical / binomial outcome variable and one or more categorical or continuous predictor variables .",
    "the binomial outcome variable predicted in this paper is the feature named ` reachedcompositeendpoint ' .",
    "the predictive accuracy based on all available 57 attributes , after applying the logistic regression method , is * 73.34 * % which indicates possible overfitting due to the large number of features used . in order to increase the overall predictive accuracy",
    ", we used a statistical backward feature selection method @xcite with tenfold cross validation , to identify all significant variables at a confidence interval of 95% .",
    "the list of significant features ( at the 95 % confidence level ) was found to be : sex , montreallocationdiagnosis , hbi , fromlastupdatemontrealmonth , maxmontrealbehaviour , plt , abdominalpainid , liquidstoolperday , mouthulcer , countbeforecendpoint , minbeforecendpoint , avgbeforecendpoint , avglogbeforecendpoint , maxbeforecendpoint , countbeforemontrealincrease , maxbeforemontrealincrease and avgbmontrealincrease .",
    "application of the logistic regression model using these features resulted in an improved predictive accuracy , increasing from * 73.34*% ( with 57 features ) to * 80.02*% ( with 17 features ) as shown in table [ logit ] .",
    "table [ sig ] shows the 17 extracted predictive features at 95% confidence level .",

    "in this paper we have introduced a novel esn based predictive model , for retrospective fc analysis , and benchmarked it against the conventional logistic regression model .",
    "our model outperformed the logistic regression model and was found to be more accurate .",
    "future work will include extending the initial predictive analysis in this paper , by applying our novel esn approach to the following cases , and bench marking against conventional logistic regression analysis - to identifying factors predictive of reaching : ( 1 ) secondary end points ( 2 ) advancement in montreal behaviour ( 3 ) surgical resection ( 4 ) hospitalisation for flares    finally , we will apply and comparatively evaluate both single layered @xcite , and our newly proposed multiple layer echo state network model @xcite on this massively unstructured retrospective data set .",
