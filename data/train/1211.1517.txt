    "a well established mechanism of spin chirality is the spin - orbit dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) interaction which is responsible for intricate magnetic patterns in the mnsi - type crystals .",
    "even half a century after the discovery of the strange magnetic properties of mnsi @xcite , the magnetics with the @xmath0 crystal structure still amaze us with the variety and complexity of their magnetic phases and electronic properties @xcite contrasting the simplicity of the crystalline arrangement ( only four magnetic atoms per a unit cell ) . among the magnetic phases ,",
    "both experimentally observed and hypothetical , are simple and cone helices @xcite , the skyrmions and their lattices associated with the recently found @xmath3-phase @xcite , possible 3d structures @xcite similar to the blue phases of liquid crystals , etc .",
    "this variety is due to , first , the lack of inverse and mirror symmetries , which gives rise to the chirality of the crystalline and spin structures ; second , the frustrations @xcite resulting from nontrivial topology of the trillium lattice , that introduces a competition of various interactions between different pairs of atoms .",
    "beginning from the discovery of the chiral magnetic properties of mnsi in 1976 @xcite till present day the most used approach to describe and predict twisted magnetic structures remains the phenomenological theory based on the ginsburg  landau free energy with an additional term first introduced by dzyaloshinskii @xcite .",
    "however , the approach , which uses our knowledge of the system symmetry , is not able to say anything about the values of coefficients in the free energy , for instance , how they are connected with the real interactions between atoms .",
    "the microscopic theories , e.g. the model of the classical heisenberg ferromagnetics with a spin - orbit term originally developed by moriya @xcite , have in their turn the shortcoming that the number of variables , including the spins of all the magnetic atoms , is infinite , and therefore they are difficult to use for any analytical computations .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of some doubts about validity the heisenberg model in the itinerant magnetics , it is often used for digital simulations @xcite . for this model",
    "it is of great importance to know the parameters of different interactions between pairs of spins : @xmath4 for exchange coupling of @xmath5th and @xmath6th atoms , and vectors @xmath7 for dm interactions .",
    "those parameters can be obtained in two ways : from comparison of theoretical results with an experimental data and by means of _ ab intio _ calculations .    in our recent work @xcite , using a coarse - grained approximation , the phenomenological constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the elastic free energy have been connected with the corresponding parameters of the microscopic theory .",
    "a surprising detail was the recognition of inter - sublattice canting as a new microscopic feature of the magnetic structures in the mnsi - type crystals .",
    "[ fig - canting ] shows the difference between the twist and the canting by example of a 1d spin chain .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the canting could give us an argument for applicability of the heisenberg model to the itinerant ferromagnetics of mnsi - type @xcite .",
    "similar features could be observed in dielectric chiral magnetics like recently studied multiferroics cu@xmath10oseo@xmath11 @xcite , bifeo@xmath11 @xcite and langasite - type crystals @xcite .",
    "though the theory with only nearest neighbors interactions is frequently used to simulate spin structures @xcite , it does not always give an adequate physical description .",
    "indeed , very often the coupling between second and next neighbors is comparable or even more considerable than that of the nearest neighbors .",
    "thus , for example , in the weak ferromagnetic @xmath12-fe@xmath10o@xmath11 , the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and dm interactions are expected to be the most strong for third and fourth neighbors ( see _ ab initio _ calculations in @xcite ) ; this is also supported by the experimental data for the heisenberg exchange parameters @xcite .",
    "it also could happen that only with the interactions between non - nearest neighbors one can describe an experimentally observed phenomenon .",
    "for example , if in a 1d spin chain with the ferromagnetic coupling between the nearest neighbors ( @xmath13 ) one turns on the antiferromagnetic interaction with the second neighbors ( @xmath14 ) , then for @xmath15 a spiral magnetic structure appears owing to spontaneous breaking of the inverse symmetry .",
    "such approach can explain the phase transition appearing at @xmath1628 k and inducing ferroelectricity in the multiferroic tb(dy)mno@xmath11 crystal @xcite .",
    "the approach works also in the itinerant magnetics of mnsi - type .",
    "just the competition between ferromagnetic coupling of the nearest spins ( @xmath17 ) and antiferromagnetic coupling of the second and third neighbors ( @xmath18 ) was utilized to explain the observed alignment of magnetic helices along crystallographic directions @xmath19 in mnsi at high pressure @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest a possible mechanism for effective reinforcement of the twist terms in the chiral spin structures of the @xmath0 magnetics , taking into account the interactions with non - nearest neighbors .",
    "the reinforcement is caused by an interplay between the exchange coupling with the second and third neighbors and the canting from dm interactions . in sections",

    "let us shortly describe the properties of the dm vector @xcite .",
    "( i ) as it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , the sign of the dm vector depends on which atom of the bond we consider as the first . indeed , because the cross product changes its sign when @xmath22 and @xmath23 are rearranged , then @xmath25 .",

    "( iii ) the dm vector of a bond possesses the local symmetry of the bond .",
    "thus , in mnsi the dm vectors are of their most general form , i.e. they have three independent components , because the mn - mn bonds in the @xmath0 structure do not possess any internal symmetry element .",
    "( iv ) the dm vectors vary from bond to bond ; the dm vectors of the equivalent bonds have the same length but may be of different orientation ( just the case of mnsi ) . in particular , if two bonds are connected by the rotation symmetry transformation of the space group @xmath27 of the crystal , then their dm vectors do by the corresponding rotation of the point group @xmath28 .    in the phenomenological theory ,",
    "the chiral interaction is induced by the following extra term @xmath29\\ ] ] in the expression for the magnetic energy density . here",
    "@xmath30 is a continuous field of the magnetic moment , @xmath9 is a pseudoscalar constant of the interaction .",
    "because both the theories describe the same matter , there should be a relationship between them .",
    "in particular , the terms ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) and ( [ eq : phenomenological ] ) of the different approaches should be somehow connected .",
    "indeed , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the nearest neighbors approximation the constant @xmath9 of the phenomenological theory is proportional to the component @xmath31 of the dm vector of the bond @xmath32 between neighboring manganese atoms .",
    "however , there is a problem here .",
    "according to different spin - orbit calculation schemes @xcite , the dm vector associated with a bond should be perpendicular or almost perpendicular to the bond . in the present case",
    "it means that the component @xmath31 , which lies almost along the bond , constitutes only a small part of the dm vector length .",
    "taking into account that having the relativistic nature spin - orbit dm interaction serves as a small additive to the ferromagnetic exchange coupling , we can conclude that the twist observed in the mnsi - type crystals , particularly in mnge , seems to be abnormally strong .",
    "a possible solution of this problem is that the nearest neighbors approximation is not sufficient and hereinafter in the paper we develop this idea in details .    in the following sections we will show , how to perform transformation from the microscopic heisenberg model to the macroscopic elastic theory .",
    "in the classical heisenberg model of magnetics with an extra interaction of the dzyaloshinskii  moriya type , the energy of the system is expressed as a sum of pair interactions between magnetic atoms and the interaction of individual atoms with an external magnetic field @xmath33 : @xmath34 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{d}_{n , ij } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_i)(\\mathbf{d}_{n , ij } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_j)}{2j_n } \\right\\ } - g \\mu_b \\mathbf{h } \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\mathbf{s}_i \\right ) .\\ ] ] here the external summation is over all the unit cells of the crystal , @xmath35 enumerates magnetic coordination shells , the sum @xmath36 is over all the bonds of the shell @xmath35 , the sum over @xmath5 is taken over all magnetic atoms in the unit cell ; @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the exchange coupling interaction parameter of the @xmath35th shell , @xmath39 is the dm vector of the bond @xmath40 of the @xmath35th shell , @xmath41 are classical spins of magnetic atoms , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the effective magnetic moment of the atom .",

    "notice that the change of the sign of the constant @xmath133 , corresponding to the transition from ferromagnetic ( @xmath196 ) to antiferromagnetic ( @xmath204 ) coupling , increases degree of the twist ( reduces the helix pitch ) and changes its handedness .",

    "an essential difference of the microscopic description of the magnetic properties of the mnsi - type crystals from the phenomenological one is the usage of the pseudovector @xmath271 instead of pseudoscalar @xmath9 when describing the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya interaction .",
    "the presence of the extra parameters ( pseudovector components ) results in the existence of a local canting , the feature not studied yet in magnetic twisted structures .",
    "an important problem solved in the present work is how to distinguish the components of @xmath271 responsible for the twist and the canting .",
    "hopkinson and kee in ref .",
    "@xcite showed numerically ( in the nearest neighbors approximation ) that responsible for the twist were the components of the @xmath271-vectors lying along the bonds , whereas for the canting did the @xmath271 components directed perpendicular to the bonds and lying in the planes of bond triangles in the trillium lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite we specified the result and showed that real components of @xmath271 inducing the twist and the canting lay along crystallographic directions closed to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the problem remained that in accordance with the quantum mechanical description the dm vectors should be perpendicular or almost perpendicular to the bonds . in other words , the @xmath271 components responsible for the twist accordingly to refs .",
    "@xcite could be diminutive . in order to solve the problem we take into account the contribution of non - nearest neighbors in the magnetic interaction .",
    "surprisingly , it appears that in the case , when all the dm vectors are perpendicular to the bonds , the spiralling is determined by the same @xmath271 components as the canting .",
    "it leads to the conclusion that the canting , initially being considered as an additional microscopic effect in relation to the global twist , can in fact serve as a cause of the abnormal twist experimentally found in the mnsi - type crystals , particularly in mnge .",
    "it is also important that the contribution of non - nearest magnetic neighbors should be taken into account .    in the simplest phenomenological theory describing twisted magnetic structures",
    ", it is supposed that @xmath272 , which is roughly true at low temperatures , far below the phase transition from the paramagnetic state .",
    "however , this condition makes energetically unfavorable such structures as the skyrmions and their lattices , associated with the a - phase observed close by the transition point . in order to overcome this problem as well as to describe the critical phenomena , two additional terms , @xmath273 and @xmath274 , limiting the value of magnetic moment",
    "are included into the free energy @xcite .",
    "the presence of the terms decreases @xmath275 in the regions with a large density of the magnetic energy , thereby decreasing the energy of the whole structure .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite the terms @xmath273 and @xmath274 are used in order to calculate the energy of skyrmions .",
    "it is found that @xmath275 decreases considerably nearby the core of the skyrmion , where the magnetic moment @xmath30 has the opposite direction to the external magnetic field , and has a maximum at some distance from the core , where the energy gain from the double twist is maximal .",
    "however , in the latter case the magnetic moment exceeds its saturation value @xmath276 , which is not acceptable for physical reasons . in the present work",
    "we show that there should be a contribution from the canting @xmath277 into the energy density , which can play the same role as @xmath273 and @xmath274 , but does not allow the magnetic moment modulus to exceed the saturation threshold . besides the canting , the thermal fluctuations of spins also contribute to the reduction of the magnetic moment @xmath275 .",
    "nearby the transition point the amplitude of the fluctuations can be comparable with the canting . moreover , the less is the effective local field @xmath278 , acting on the individual spin @xmath41 , the more are fluctuations and cantings .",
    "therefore , the reinforcement both of the thermal fluctuations and the canting have the same cause , so they should give a similar effect .",
    "if the canting would be observed in mnsi , the direct confirmation of non - nearest neighbors effect could be possible using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa2 ] ) , connecting the propagation number of the magnetic helices with the magnitude of the residual canting in the unwound state in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the equation involves only the exchange constants @xmath38 and does not depend on the dm vectors . the possibility of an experimental proof of the theory should stimulate _ ab intio _ calculations of the interaction constants .",
    "some semi - quantitative estimations are made in the present work with use of the rkky model .",
    "however problems still remain .",
    "for example , the rkky parameter @xmath238 for mnsi corresponds to the area , where @xmath258 and @xmath279 .",
    "more realistic calculations would give a tip about the direction of the further search .",
    "it has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the propagation number @xmath280 of the magnetic helix in the alloy fe@xmath1co@xmath281si is strongly dependent on the concentration @xmath53 of the cobalt atoms .",
    "thus , when @xmath53 changes from 0.05 to 0.15 , the helix period decreases abruptly in several times .",
    "it can be explained , in particular , by the strong dependence of the fermi wave number @xmath213 on the cobalt impurity concentration , which also effects on the exchange parameters @xmath210 , @xmath8 and @xmath101 .",
    "this phenomenon could be also responsible for the recently observed @xcite change of the sign of the magnetic chirality in mn@xmath1fe@xmath2ge alloys .",
    "this is drastically different from the usually supposed change of the sign of the dm interaction . indeed , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cald2 ] ) shows that the chirality can change even if the microscopic dm interaction , defined by the vectors @xmath271 , remains constant . in this case",
    "the sign change is due to the interplay between the exchange parameters @xmath254 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 of three magnetic shells .",
    "thus a potential possibility arises to control the sign of the magnetic chirality by varying the concentration of the different components and therefore affecting the fermi wave number @xmath213 .",
    "notice that the possibility of such effect becomes evident only when the interactions with non - nearest neighbors are taken into account .",
    "another interesting fact , not being yet explained within the framework of microscopic theories , is the helix ordering along some special directions , e.g. @xmath282 or @xmath283 . usually this ordering is associated with a weak anisotropic exchange @xcite , but in fact the ordinary dm interaction also can result in the appearing of cubic anisotropic terms in the energy of spiral orientation in the lattice with a cubic space group .",
    "these contributions of the order @xmath284 will determine the critical magnetic field @xmath285 , at which the helix comes off from its preferable zero - field direction .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the observed ratio of the first and second critical fields @xmath286 , because it follows from our estimations that @xmath287 . indeed , e.g. the period of the magnetic helix in mnsi makes about 40 unit cell parameters , which gives the value @xmath288 for the propagation number modulus @xmath289 . on the other part , it follows from the phenomenological description that @xmath290 , or @xmath291 .",
    "this gives us the estimation @xmath292 , which is in a good agreement with the experimental data . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we proposed a coarse grain approximation , which allowed us to calculate only the contributions to the energy proportional to @xmath20 . in the present work",
    "a new approach has been developed permitting more precise calculations of the energy .",
    "in particular , the terms of the order of @xmath284 would give us a contribution of the dzyaloshinskii ",
