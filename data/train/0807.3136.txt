    "we get from lemma [ homo ] @xmath322 therefore , it suffices to show the lemma in the three following cases :    @xmath323 is an annulus @xmath324 ,    @xmath325 is a sector @xmath326 and @xmath327 ,    @xmath325 is a strip @xmath328 .",
    "the _ annulus case _ has been treated in section [ s2.1 ] , except that the set @xmath329 is now replaced by a subset @xmath330 .",
    "the necessary modifications in the proof are rather minor , and so will be omitted here .    _ the sector case .",

    "also , our corollary  [ decadix](b ) may be improved for a sector .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  4 ) for a discussion of optimized upper bounds as a function of @xmath349 .    _",
    "the strip case .",
    "_ we now have @xmath350 and @xmath351 with @xmath352 .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are spectral sets for the operator @xmath4 , we have @xmath353 for all @xmath44 with @xmath354 . hence",
    ", if we denote @xmath335 and write @xmath355 , the self - adjoint operator @xmath69 satisfies @xmath356 and @xmath357 we then deduce from lemma [ pm ] that @xmath345 is completely bounded with a complete bound @xmath358 where @xmath359    [ remm ] the key points in the proof of this lemma has been the homographic invariance of the differential forms , and the choice of the median lines as paths of integration . for our proof for more than two disks presented below , it will be useful to give a more abstract definition of median lines in terms of sets of equal `` distance '' to some parts of the boundary of @xmath10 : given a disk @xmath45 of the riemann sphere , we introduce the following notation @xmath360 by means of elementary computations we have @xmath361 with the riemann conformal map @xmath362 from @xmath45 onto the unit disk @xmath363 . as a consequence , @xmath364 is the infinitesimal carathodory pseudodistance . in particular , it becomes obvious that @xmath365 for any mbius map @xmath244 .",
    "note also that @xmath366 , if @xmath257 tends to the boundary of @xmath45 .",
    "+ now , if @xmath52 and @xmath265 are two disks with non empty intersection , we introduce their median line @xmath367 @xmath368 from ( [ caratheodory3 ] ) it follows that , if @xmath367 is the median line of @xmath52 and @xmath265 , and if @xmath244 is a mbius map , then @xmath369 is the median line of @xmath370 and @xmath371 .",
    "also , the circle @xmath329 is the median line in the annulus case @xmath225 , the positive real semi axis is the median line in the sector case , the real axis is the median line in the strip case .",
    "this shows that the present definition effectively coincides with the notion of median line used in the beginning of this section with the curve @xmath308 .",
    "we can now present the proof of the general case of theorem  [ thm0 ] .",
    "we consider @xmath0 closed disks @xmath1 , @xmath2,  ,@xmath3 of the riemann sphere , with @xmath372 , for all @xmath373 , such that @xmath374 has a non - empty interior ( these two assumptions can be added without loss of generality in the statement of theorem  [ thm0 ] ) . given @xmath0 points @xmath375 in the complex plane , the classical voronoi tesselation of @xmath10 consists in dividing up the set @xmath10 in sets @xmath376 of points @xmath377 such that @xmath107 is at least as close to @xmath378 as to any of the other points @xmath379 for @xmath380 . in order to find the new integration paths in our representation formula for the residual term",
    ", we will construct a similar voronoi tesselation , but use the distance to the boundaries @xmath381 instead of the distance to points . in our case",
    ", this distance will be measured in terms of @xmath382 , the reciprocal of the infinitesimal carathodory pseudodistance ( see remark [ remm ] ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath383 if @xmath377 tends to @xmath384 .",
    "to be more precise , let @xmath385 by construction , the union @xmath386 equals our set @xmath10 .",
    "we notice a difference between the present case and the @xmath8 case : the intersection @xmath387 for @xmath373 is a subset of the median line @xmath367 of the disks @xmath52 and @xmath265 , which , in general is a proper subset , since the median line @xmath367 does not need to be a subset of @xmath376 , see figures  [ figure2][figure4 ] .",
    "this situation does not occur in the case @xmath8 of two disks .    in order to make the situation clearer in the general case @xmath388 , recall that the boundary of @xmath10 may be written as a union of the sets @xmath389 for @xmath55 , where any two of these sets have at most @xmath226 points in common ( otherwise two of the disks @xmath52 would have identical boundary , in contradiction to the assumptions on the disks mentioned above ) . from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath390 for @xmath391 approaching @xmath381 it follows that @xmath392 for @xmath55 , that is , @xmath376 can be considered as a kind of closed neighborhood in @xmath10 of @xmath393 .",
    "it is now important to observe that , by construction , the boundary of @xmath376 may be written as the union of @xmath389 and of @xmath387 for @xmath380 or , in other words , of the parts of the median lines @xmath367 for @xmath394 being a subset of @xmath376 .",
    "again , any two of these pieces of @xmath395 being all circular arcs have at most two points in common , since a non - trivial part of @xmath381 can not be a ( part of a ) median line for disks @xmath52 and @xmath265 for @xmath380 , and two medians @xmath367 and @xmath396 only have more than two points in common for @xmath397 if @xmath398 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that , for a function analytic in @xmath399 , the path of integration @xmath400 can be replaced by the union of paths formed by the parts of the median lines @xmath367 for @xmath401 , @xmath380 , which have a non - empty intersection with @xmath376 ( and thus also with @xmath402 ) . since the orientation of these median lines",
    "is changed if we permute @xmath403 and @xmath221 , we may conclude that , for any @xmath97 , @xmath404 thus theorem  [ thm0 ] follows from corollary  [ decadix ] and lemma  [ lem4 ] .",
