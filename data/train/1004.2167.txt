    "relativistic jets in radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) dissipate their kinetic energy via interactions with surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) or intracluster medium ( icm ) , and inflate a bubble composed of decelerated jet matter , which is often referred to as cocoon .",
    "initially , the cocoon is highly overpressured against the ambient ism / icm and a strong shock is driven into the ambient matter . then a thin shell is formed around the cocoon by the compressed ambient medium . as in other astrophysical shocks , the shells are expected to be a promising site for particle accelerations , since the shocks are driven into tenuous plasmas . in the present study , we explore the evolution of the non - thermal emissions by the accelerated electrons in the shocked shells .",
    "we properly take into account the comptonization of photons of various origins which were not considered in the previous studies.@xcite focusing on the powerful sources which host luminous quasar in its core , we show , in particular , that the energy of accelerated electrons is efficiently converted through the ic scattering to high energy @xmath3-rays of up to @xmath4 if the source is relatively compact .",
    "when considering the dynamics of the expanding cocoon and shell , we neglect the elongation in the jet direction and assume that they are spherical for simplicity .",
    "we also assume that the ambient mass density profile has a form of a power - law given by @xmath5 .",
    "we further assume that the kinetic power of jet , @xmath6 , is constant in time . under these assumptions ,",
    "the dynamics can be approximately described based on the model of stellar wind bubbles.@xcite then radius of the shock is written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "also the total internal energy stored in the shell can be expressed as @xmath11 , implying that roughly @xmath12 of the total energy released by the jet is deposited in the shell .",
    "the energy distribution of the non - thermal electrons is determined by solving the kinetic equation in one - zone approximation which takes in account the injection of electrons and the cooling effects.@xcite the electron injection rate @xmath13 and the cooling rate @xmath14 , which will be described below , are evaluated based on the dynamical model described above .",
    "we assume that the electrons are injected into the post - shock region with a power - law energy distribution given as @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 corresponds to the maximum lorentz factor .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is obtained by equating the the cooling rate , @xmath14 , to the acceleration rate given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the magnetic field strength in the post - shock region and the expansion velocity of the shell , respectively . here , @xmath21 is the so - called `` gyro - factor '' which can be identified with the ratio of the energy in ordered magnetic fields to that in turbulent ones .",
    "we postulate @xmath22 ( bohm limit ) , as is observed to be the case for some snrs .",
    "@xcite@xcite assuming that the magnetic field of ambient ism / icm ( @xmath23 few @xmath24)@xcite@xcite is adiabatically compressed by the shock , we take @xmath25 as a fiducial value for the magnetic field strength . the normalisation factor , @xmath26 , is determined from the assumption that a fraction , @xmath27 , of the energy stored in the shell is carried by the non - thermal electrons . in the present study , as a fiducial case ,",
    "we assume @xmath28 .",
    "it is noted that since the factor @xmath26 is proportionate to @xmath27 and @xmath6 , the resultant luminosity of non - thermal emissions also scales in the same manner with these quantities .    in the cooling rate ,",
    "@xmath14 , the adiabatic losses due to expansion of the shell and the radiative losses due to synchrotron and ic emissions are taken into account . regarding the synchrotron losses , the magnetic field considered above",
    "is used . in evaluating the cooling rate for ic scattering ,",
    "we take into account various seed photons of relevance in this context .",
    "the considered photon fields are uv emissions from the accretion disc , ir emissions from the dusty torus , stellar emissions from the host galaxy in nir , synchrotron emissions from the radio lobe and cmb .",
    "we assume that the photons from the disc , torus , host galaxy , and cmb are monochromatic and have the following single frequencies : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the photons from the radio lobe are assumed to have a continuous spectrum given by @xmath33 . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on powerful sources hosting luminous quasars and adopt @xmath34 for the luminosity of the uv emissions from the disc .",
    "we assume that the luminosity of the ir emissions from the torus is equal to that of the uv emissions ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the host galaxy is assumed as @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the luminosity of the lobe is determined by assuming that a fraction @xmath37 of the jet power is radiated as radio emissions from the lobe ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) . here",
    "we assume @xmath39 as a fiducial case .",
    "from the obtained electron distribution , we calculate the spectra of synchrotron and ic radiations . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we show the photon fluxes , @xmath40 , for sources located at distance of @xmath41 .",
    "the left panels show the case for sources with jet powers of @xmath42 , while the right panels show the case for @xmath43 .",
    "the top , middle and bottom panels of the figure correspond to the source sizes of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the total photon flux ( _ thick solid line _ ) , we show the contributions from the synchrotron emissions ( _ thin solid line _ ) and the ic scatterings of uv disc photons ( _ long - short - dashed line _ ) , ir torus photons ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) , nir host - galaxy photons ( _ dotted line _ ) , cmb photons ( _ long - dashed line _ ) and lobe photons ( _ short - dashed line _ ) .",
    "the synchrotron emissions are the main low - frequency component , which extends from radio to @xmath47 x - ray .",
    "the ic emissions become remarkable at higher frequencies up to @xmath48 gamma - ray .",
    "when the source is young and hence small , the radiative output is dominated by the ic emissions , since the energy density of photons is larger than that of magnetic fields ( referred to as the ic - dominated stage ) . as the the source becomes larger , on the other hand , the energy density of photons decreases ( @xmath49 ) and the synchrotron emissions becomes dominant ( the synchrotron - dominated stage ) . among the contributions to the ic emissions ,",
    "the scattering of the ir torus photons is the largest at least in the ic - dominated stage thanks to the high energy density of the ir photons .",
    "note that , although the uv disc photons are assumed to have the same energy density as the ir photons , the ic scattering of uv photons is suppressed at the frequencies above @xmath50 by the klein - nishina effect .",
    "then the transition from the ic - dominated stage to the synchrotron - dominated stage occurs roughly at @xmath51 which corresponds to the condition @xmath52 .",
    "while the contributions from the uv disc photons , host - galaxy photons and lobe photons are modest at best through the entire evolution , the ic scattering of cmb photons dominates over other ic components for sources larger than @xmath53 .",
    "the peak luminosities in the spectra are roughly equal to the energy injection rate on the non - thermal electrons ( @xmath54 ) because the cooling time scale of the high energy electrons is shorter than the dynamical time scale ( fast cooling ) . since the energy injection rate is independent of the electron energy ( @xmath55 )",
    ", these non - thermal electrons produce a rather flat and broad spectrum ( @xmath56 ) in the corresponding frequency range .",
    "we can give a rough estimate to the peak luminosity as @xmath57 , or , equivalently , to the peak flux as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the feature is clearly seen in fig . [ f1 ] .",
    "indeed , the spectra are flat with a peak flux given approximately by the above estimation .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the emission luminosity scale approximately linearly with the acceleration efficiency @xmath27 and the jet power @xmath6 . for given values of @xmath27 and @xmath6 , while the value of @xmath61 remains nearly constant , the frequency range , where the spectrum is flat , varies with the source size because of the changes in the energy range of the fast cooling electrons and the main emission mechanism ( synchrotron or ic ) .",
    "it is emphasized that the peak luminosity is chiefly governed by @xmath27 and @xmath6 and is quite insensitive to the magnetic field strength and seed photons , which will only affect the frequency range of the flat spectrum .",
    "this means that if @xmath6 is constrained by other independent methods , @xcite@xcite the observation of the peak luminosity will enable us to obtain information on the acceleration efficiency @xmath27 .",
    "next we consider the detection prospect .",
    "the synchrotron emissions can be observed at frequencies from radio to x - ray .",
    "obviously large sources ( @xmath62 ) offer a greater chance of detection than small ones , since the synchrotron radiation is strongly suppressed in the compact sources and the small spatial scale will make it difficult to distinguish the synchrotron radiations from the core emissions of agn . even for large sources ( @xmath62 ) , however , the synchrotron emissions are subject to contaminations with radio emissions from the lobe , optical emissions from the host galaxy and x - ray emissions from ism / icm , which are at least partially cospacial .",
    "the obtained luminosity of the shell emissions is likely to be lower than that of these emissions .",
    "hence the observation of the synchrotron emissions will be very difficult irrespective of the source size .    in the case of the ic emissions , which are pronounced in gamma - ray , compact sources ( @xmath63 )",
    "are favored for detection , since the luminosity is higher .",
    "also significant contamination is not expected in this energy range for non - blazar agns . at the photon energy of @xmath64 ,",
    "the detection limit of the fermi gamma - ray telescope is roughly @xmath65 whereas modern cherenkov telescopes such as hess , magic and veritas have a detection limit of @xmath66 at @xmath67 . from the estimated peak flux , @xmath68 , we find that the currently operating gamma - ray telescopes are capable of detecting these emissions at @xmath69 and @xmath70 if the jet power satisfies @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , and the source size is smaller than @xmath73",
    "this can be confirmed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] indeed . for",
    "the most powerful source with the jet power of @xmath43 located at @xmath41 , @xmath74 gamma - rays from the shell may be accessible to the fermi , magic , hess and veritas gamma - ray telescopes if the source is compact .",
    "we have explored the temporal evolution of the emissions by accelerated electrons in the shocked shell produced by agn jets .",
    "below we summarize our main findings in this study .",
    "\\(i ) when the source is young and small ( @xmath75 ) , the dominant radiative process is the ic scattering of ir photons emitted from the dust torus . for larger sources , on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron emissions dominate over the ic emissions , since the energy density of photons becomes smaller than that of magnetic fields ( @xmath76 ) . through the entire evolution ,",
    "the spectrum is rather broad and flat , and the peak luminosity is approximately given by @xmath77 , since it is roughly equal to the energy injection rate , which is in turn determined by the jet power @xmath6 and acceleration efficiency @xmath27 .",
    "\\(ii ) the spectra of the ic emissions extend up to @xmath4 gamma - ray energies for a wide range of source size ( @xmath78 ) and jet power ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "for most powerful nearby sources ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , @xmath2 gamma - rays produced via the ic emissions can be detected by fermi / lat as well as by the modern cherenkov telescopes such as magic , hess and veritas if the source is compact ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the observation of these emissions enable us to probe the acceleration efficiency @xmath27 of which little has been known so far .",
