    "the last decade saw great progress in our understanding of the distant universe as a number of objects at @xmath0 were discovered , including galaxies @xcite , quasars @xcite , and @xmath15-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "they provide key information to study the formation and evolution of the earliest galaxies , supermassive black holes , and massive stars when the universe was less than one billion years old .",
    "the observations of these objects such as the detection of gunn - peterson troughs in quasar spectra @xcite , together with the measurements of the polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite , indicate that at @xmath0 we are approaching the epoch of cosmic reionization , during which the intergalactic space became transparent to hi - ionizing uv photons .",
    "the first @xmath0 galaxies were discovered to be ly@xmath4  emitters ( laes ) at @xmath16 using the narrow - band technique @xcite .",
    "this technique has been an efficient way to find high - redshift galaxies since the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath0 laes has increased to almost one hundred with a high success rate of spectroscopic confirmation due to the presence of strong ly@xmath4  emission lines @xcite .",
    "now ly@xmath4  surveys are able to detect lae candidates at @xmath17 @xcite . however , the narrow - band technique has its own limitations .",
    "narrow - band filters are built to use dark atmospheric windows with little sky oh emission .",
    "such windows are rare at the red end of the optical range ( even rarer in the near - ir ) , and are also very narrow ( @xmath18  ) , resulting in small survey volumes .",
    "the dropout technique @xcite does not have these limitations .",
    "it has produced a substantial number of lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) candidates at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "most recently with the power of the new @xmath19 wfc3/ir camera , lbg candidates at @xmath20 ( up to @xmath21 ) are being routinely found ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , although they are mostly too faint to be spectroscopically confirmed by current facilities .    with the large sample of lbg candidates , the galaxy uv luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath0 has been established .",
    "the general result is that the faint - end slope of the lf at @xmath22 is very steep , and the characteristic luminosity dims significantly from lower redshifts to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "now one of the main concerns is that there is a lack of well - defined spectroscopic lbg samples to cross - check the lf . as mentioned above , spectroscopic identifications of @xmath0 lbg candidates are extremely difficult unless they are bright and have strong ly@xmath4  emission lines , in which case spectroscopy could still be costly @xcite .",
    "unfortunately most of the known lbg candidates at @xmath0 are in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) due to the abundance of the high - quality deep data , and thus they are very faint .",
    "even the @xmath19 wfc3 early release science data @xcite cover only 4050 arcmin@xmath23 and bright candidates are rare . with a great depth over an effective area of @xmath24 arcmin@xmath23 , the subaru deep field ( sdf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a unique field to search for relatively bright lbgs .",
    "the sdf project has been very successful in searching for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "taking advantage of an 8-m telescope and a prime - focus camera with a large field - of - view ( fov , @xmath25 ) , sdf has an impressive depth ( @xmath26 ab mag ) in five broad bands @xmath27 over a survey area of one fov .",
    "especially noteworthy is the deep observations with three narrow - band filters , nb816 , nb921 , and nb973 , corresponding to the detection of laes at @xmath14 , 6.5 , and 7 , respectively .",
    "so far sdf has spectroscopically identified @xmath18 laes at @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a few laes at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "sdf has also found a sample of bright lbg candidates at @xmath0 @xcite up to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "five strong laes from a list of @xmath1-dropout objects ( or lbg candidates ) have already been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "note that the difference between laes and lbgs is somewhat arbitrary and there is no clear separation line between them , so we simply call the galaxies found by the narrow - band technique as laes and those found by the dropout technique as lbgs .",
    "a lbg is also a lae if it is identified to have a strong ly@xmath4  emission line . in this paper",
    "we present our deep spectroscopic observations of @xmath0 lbg candidates in sdf using a new , ultra deep @xmath3-band image ( 29 hour integration ) for target selection .",
    "this image allows us to select candidates down to @xmath2 mag , roughly one mag deeper than the lbgs found by @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly describes our selection criteria and follow - up observations of galaxy candidates .",
    "section 3 presents the results of our spectroscopic observations .",
    "we derive the uv - continuum and ly@xmath4  lfs in section 4 , and summarize the paper in section 5 . throughout the paper",
    "we use a @xmath31-dominated flat cosmology with h@xmath32 km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "all magnitudes are on an ab system @xcite .",
    "we selected @xmath0 galaxy candidates using the sdf broad - band images .",
    "the sdf public data have a depth of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 detection for point sources ) , covering an effective area of @xmath24 arcmin@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite have used the public data to find bright lbgs down to @xmath43 .",
    "recently the sdf team has obtained a much deeper @xmath3-band image with a total integration time of @xmath44 hours and a depth of @xmath45 mag @xcite .",
    "our candidate selection was based on this deep @xmath3-band image together with the public data in the other four bluer broad bands .",
    "we used the traditional dropout technique , i.e. , our candidates are @xmath1-band dropout objects .",
    "the basic criteria are @xmath46 the color cut is more stringent than @xmath47 used by @xcite .",
    "this is to reduce the number of contaminants scattered into the selection region due to large @xmath1-band photometric errors . to remove foreground contaminants",
    ", we required that the candidates are not detected ( @xmath48 ) in three broad bands @xmath49 .",
    "we also rejected possible @xmath16 lae candidates which are relatively bright in the nb921 band with respect to their @xmath50-band photometry(@xmath51 ) , since these candidates were being targeted in another program @xcite .",
    "we obtained 499 @xmath1-dropouts in the whole sdf field .",
    "we then visually inspected each candidate , and removed those with any possible detections in any of the @xmath49 bands and those that were likely spurious detections ( e.g. blended with bright stars ) .",
    "the @xmath1-band image is deep enough in most cases of our selection . in the extreme case of @xmath2",
    "in which the color cut determines @xmath52 , we visually inspected the candidates and simply required that the candidates should not be detected in the @xmath1-band ( in addition to the @xmath49 bands ) .",
    "we generated an @xmath53 point source ( almost all known @xmath54 sdf galaxies are point sources in sdf images ) and put it in a number of blank regions of the @xmath1-band image .",
    "we cut out these regions and mixed them with other blank regions that do not have the simulated point source . as a result ,",
    "more than 95% of the regions with the @xmath53 source were visually identified , so our visual inspection is reliable in this case .",
    "finally , 196 promising candidates survived for our follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopic observations were carried out with deimos @xcite on the keck ii telescope on 2528 april 2009 .",
    "the typical seeing was @xmath55 .",
    "a total of 79 galaxy candidates from the above were covered by six masks , but only 73 of them were observed due to slit conflict . there were roughly 100 slitlets per mask ; most of the slitlets were assigned to the targets of @xcite and various secondary targets .",
    "we used the 830 lines mm@xmath33 grating with the order blocking filter og550 .",
    "the wavelength coverage is roughly from 6000 to 10,000  .",
    "with a @xmath55 slit width , the resolving power was @xmath56 .",
    "the total integration time per mask was @xmath57 hours , broken into individual exposures of 20 or 30 min .",
    "we also observed a spectrophotometric standard star bd+28d4211 in long - slit mode with the same grating and order blocking filter .",
    "the data were reduced with the deep2 deimos data pipeline based on the spec2d idl package .",
    "the deimos flexure compensation system ( fcs ) failed in the beginning of our observing run , which caused problems with the data reduction , as flexure could happen in both spatial and spectral directions .",
    "we shifted the spectral images along the both directions manually based on sky emission lines and flat - field images before we fed the data to the pipeline .",
    "the pipeline corrected for any small residual shifts .",
    "we extracted the spectra of our targets and flux - calibrated the spectra using alignment stars .",
    "there were typically 45 bright ( @xmath58 ) alignment stars per mask used to align masks .",
    "they were put in @xmath59 square _ boxes _ rather than @xmath55",
    "_ slits_. the advantage of using alignment stars for flux calibration is that alignment stars and the targets were observed under exactly the same conditions such as transparency and airmass . for each mask , we first measured the spectral response from the spectra of standard star bd+28d4211 , and extracted the spectra of the alignment stars .",
    "we then calculated the count - to - flux ( erg s@xmath33 @xmath60 @xmath33 ) ratios by scaling the spectra of the alignment stars to their broad - band photometry ( @xmath1 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "the ratios among different alignment stars on a mask agree within 0.1 mag .",
    "we also incorporated slit loss ( @xmath61 ) into the count - to - flux conversion ratios .",
    "the slit loss was estimated by assuming a slit width of @xmath55 and a stable gaussian psf of @xmath55 ( typical seeing ) .",
    "finally the average of conversion ratios was applied to the spectra of other objects in this mask . because the psf is comparable to the slit width",
    ", the slit loss varies with varying seeing , possible offsets between targets and slits , and even the sizes of targets .",
    "we did not correct for these minor changes .",
    "among six mask images , one ( the first one during which fcs failed ) had more than twice lower slit throughput due to the failure of fcs or other unknown reasons .",
    "we identified one very bright lae ( out of 14 candidates ) in this mask ( no .",
    "19 in table 1 and figures 1 and 2 , see the following paragraphs ) , but we will not include this one in the analysis of spatial density and lf in the next section . in the other five masks , we identified 18 galaxies ( out of 59 candidates ) with prominent ly@xmath4  emission lines .",
    "our @xmath42 detection limit is about @xmath62 erg s@xmath33 @xmath60 at @xmath63  , and is estimated as follows .",
    "the detection limit depends on the shape of the ly@xmath4lines , as narrower lines ( for a given flux ) are easier to identify .",
    "@xcite generated two composite ly@xmath4  emission lines for their @xmath14 and 6.5 laes and found that the two lines were very similar .",
    "we create a ly@xmath4  emission model image with the shape of the composite @xmath28 lae profile .",
    "we then scale this model image and put a number of them onto the spectral images .",
    "the flux limit is determined by detecting these simulated ly@xmath4  emission from the spectral images .",
    "briefly we found one galaxy out of 14 candidates in the mask with very low throughput and found 18 galaxies out of 59 candidates in the other five masks .",
    "the remaining candidates do not show any continuum emission nor line emission , so we were not able to identify them .",
    "figure 1 shows the thumbnail images of these galaxies in two broad bands @xmath1 and @xmath3 and one narrow band nb921 .",
    "they were barely detected in the @xmath1-band images and totally invisible in the @xmath49 bands .",
    "most of them were also barely detected in the nb921 band .",
    "figure 2 shows the deimos spectra and the redshifts of the 19 galaxies .",
    "the spectra have been flux calibrated and are placed on an absolute flux scale using alignment stars .",
    "we can clearly see asymmetry in the emission lines of relatively bright galaxies .",
    "this is the indicator of the ly@xmath4  emission line at high redshift due to strong neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption blueward of the line .",
    "the non - detection in deep @xmath49 images implies that they are not likely low - redshift contaminants .",
    "in addition , the large wavelength coverage rules out the possibility that the detected lines are one of the h@xmath64 , [ oiii ] @xmath655007 , or h@xmath4  lines .",
    "the high resolution of the spectra also ensures that they are not [ oii ] @xmath653727  doublets . in a few cases in figure 2",
    "there are some residual sky lines redward of ly@xmath4  that appear like emission lines .",
    "they are not the agn feature nv  @xmath651240 , because at @xmath22 the nv  emission line is @xmath66   away .",
    "table 1 lists the galaxy coordinates , redshifts , and @xmath3-band magnitudes , as well as other properties that will be described below .",
    "this galaxy sample spans a redshift range @xmath67 and a magnitude range of @xmath68 .",
    "redshift for each galaxy is measured from the ly@xmath4  line center using a gaussian profile to fit the top @xmath6% of the line from the peak ( the rest - frame ly@xmath4  line center is assumed to be 1216  ) .",
    "note that the no . 13 galaxy in our list is no . 2 in the photometric sample of @xcite .",
    "we measure observed ly@xmath4  line fluxes by integrating the ly@xmath4  spectra over rest - frame 1215.2 ( = 12160.8 ) to 1217.2 ( = 1216 + 1.2 )  .",
    "we do not correct for igm absorption blueward of the line .",
    "table 1 shows the flux measurements and the ly@xmath4  luminosities derived from the observed fluxes .",
    "most of the galaxies in our sample have the ly@xmath4  fluxes in a range of @xmath69 erg s@xmath33 @xmath60 , comparable to the ly@xmath4  fluxes in the sdf @xmath28 lae sample @xcite .",
    "the strongest ly@xmath4  emission line ( @xmath70 erg s@xmath33 @xmath60 ) in our sample is as bright as the strongest laes from large lae surveys of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , indicating that it represents the bright end of laes at @xmath0 .",
    "table 1 also includes the star formation rates ( sfrs ) estimated from the ly@xmath4  luminosities by @xmath71 which is based on the relation between sfr and the h@xmath4  luminosity @xcite and the line emission ratio of ly@xmath4  to h@xmath4  in case b recombination @xcite .",
    "the derived sfrs are less than 10 @xmath72 for all but one galaxy .",
    "we estimate the ly@xmath4  rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) using the observed ly@xmath4  fluxes and @xmath3-band photometry .",
    "although the narrow - band nb921 photometry consists of pure continuum flux for objects at @xmath73 , our galaxies are mostly very faint in this band , preventing us from measuring reliable photometry .",
    "the broad @xmath3 band includes emission from both continuum and ly@xmath4 . to decompose the @xmath3-band photometry",
    "we assume that the uv continuum slopes ( @xmath74 ) are @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the continuum blueward of ly@xmath4  is entirely absorbed by igm .",
    "this is reasonable as seen from @xmath22 quasars @xcite .",
    "the only free parameter is then the continuum level when an observed spectrum ( continuum+ly@xmath4 ) is scaled to match the corresponding @xmath3-band photometry .",
    "the results of the ly@xmath4  ews are listed in column 8 of table 1 .",
    "column 6 shows @xmath76 , the absolute ab magnitude of continuum at rest - frame 1300  .",
    "the ew measurements are rough due to uncertainties from the broad - band photometry , ly@xmath4  fluxes , and uv slopes .",
    "we vary the assumed slope by 0.5 and the typical change on the measured ews is smaller than 15% . for a few galaxies with strong nb921 detections , we also derive their ews based on the continua from their nb921 photometry",
    ". the results mostly agree with the above measurements within 25% .",
    "nevertheless , there is no doubt that most of the galaxies in our sample have large ews .",
    "the median value of the ews is 50  , with 4 galaxies having ews higher than 100  .",
    "they are on average smaller than those in the bright sample of @xcite , whose ly@xmath4  ews are in the range of 90240  .",
    "we know little about the ly@xmath4  ew distribution of lbgs at @xmath22 .",
    "current facilities can only identify @xmath22 lbgs with prominent ly@xmath4  lines , but it is known that most lbgs at low redshift do not have strong ly@xmath4  emission . at @xmath77 , the ly@xmath4  ew distribution has been well determined based on a spectroscopic sample of more than 1000 lbgs @xcite .",
    "a half of the lbgs in this sample have ly@xmath4  absorption lines instead of emission lines , and only 17% have ly@xmath4  ews greater than 30   ( with @xmath78 % having ews @xmath79  ) , while almost all the lbgs in our sample have ews @xmath80  .",
    "therefore , lbgs in our @xmath0 sample have much stronger ly@xmath4  emission on average .",
    "statistics of ly@xmath4  ews for lbgs at @xmath81 has been tentatively investigated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite found that at @xmath82 the fractions of lbgs with ews @xmath83 and @xmath84   are roughly 20% and 8% , respectively , and at @xmath85 the two fractions increase rapidly to @xmath86% and @xmath87% .",
    "our sample spans a uv luminosity range of @xmath88 , and the two fractions in our sample are 25% ( 15/59 ) and 14% ( 8/59 ) , broadly consistent with the trend shown in their results",
    ".    the ly@xmath4  strength may also vary with luminosity .",
    "some studies have reported the inverse relationship between ly@xmath4  ew and uv luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others claimed that the relation is not obvious or there is no such relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure 3 shows the ly@xmath4  ew as a function of the continuum luminosity @xmath76 for our sample .",
    "the dashed line demonstrates the detection limit for galaxies at @xmath89 .",
    "the apparent strong correlation between ew and @xmath76 in our sample is likely due to the nature of flux - limited surveys .",
    "nevertheless , our sample has a similar luminosity range as the range of the @xmath90 lbg sample mentioned above . in the next section",
    "we will use the ew distribution at @xmath90 @xcite to correct for sample incompleteness .",
    "the galaxies presented in this paper provide a well - defined flux - limited galaxy sample down to @xmath2 .",
    "the effective area is @xmath91 arcmin@xmath23 ( five deimos mask coverage ) and the redshift range is @xmath92 . in the following subsections we will correct for sample incompleteness , calculate the spatial density of the galaxies , and derive the galaxy lf in this redshift range .    due to various selection criteria that we applied",
    ", our sample is incomplete .",
    "the sample completeness is complicated .",
    "here we correct for incompleteness which originates from three major steps , source detection , galaxy candidate selection , and spectroscopic identification .",
    "the first major incompleteness comes from the detection of sources in the sdf image .",
    "because the sdf field is crowded , any high - redshift galaxies behind foreground objects are not detected .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate this incompleteness by measuring the fraction of the area occupied by bright objects .",
    "there is another source of incompleteness due to the fact that fainter objects are more difficult to detect .",
    "we put a large number of simulated galaxies ( point sources ) in the sdf @xmath3-band image and detect them using sextractor @xcite in the way used for our galaxy candidate detection .",
    "we then measure the completeness as a function of magnitude @xmath3 by counting the fraction of detections .",
    "the combined completeness is about 75% at @xmath93 and drops to @xmath94 % at @xmath2 .",
    "the second major incompleteness comes from the magnitude limit ( @xmath95 ) and color cut ( @xmath96 ) that we applied to the candidate selection .",
    "the last major incompleteness is from the fact that our sample is biased towards lbgs with strong ly@xmath4  emission , as discussed above .",
    "we can not identify lbgs with ly@xmath4  fluxes below our detection limit in the deimos spectra .",
    "we use a selection function to correct these incompletenesses .",
    "the selection function is defined as the probability that a galaxy with a given magnitude , redshift , and intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) meets the criteria of our candidate selection and ly@xmath4  identification . by assuming a distribution for the intrinsic seds , we calculate the average selection probability as a function of magnitude and redshift . to do this ,",
    "we first produce a large set of galaxy spectra for a given ( @xmath97 ) , using the @xcite stellar population synthesis model with the salpeter imf .",
    "the magnitude @xmath76 is the absolute ab magnitude at rest - frame 1300  , and 1300   is chosen to be close to the @xmath3-band effective wavelength for @xmath22 galaxies .",
    "the input model parameters will be described in detail in the next paragraph .",
    "we then apply igm absorption to the model spectra .",
    "the neutral igm fraction increases dramatically from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , causing complete gunn - peterson troughs in some @xmath0 quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "it is thus critical to predict @xmath100 colors .",
    "we calculate igm absorption in the way used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally we measure the apparent magnitudes from the model spectra with the sdf filter transmission curves .",
    "we also incorporate photometric errors into each band .",
    "it is particularly important for faint objects , as a non - negligible fraction of real galaxies may have been scattered out of the selection region due to large photometric errors .",
    "the selection probability for this galaxy ( @xmath97 ) is then the fraction of model galaxies that meet all our criteria .",
    "the intrinsic seds of galaxies depend on their physical properties such as age , metallicity , and dust extinction . however , we know very little about physical properties of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we determine input parameters for the above synthesis models from our @xmath19 and @xmath101 observations of 20 spectroscopically - confirmed laes and lbgs at @xmath102 in sdf ( e. egami et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this sample is bright , and the spectroscopic redshifts remove one critical free parameter for sed modeling .",
    "the @xmath19 near - ir data provides rest - frame uv photometry to decipher the properties of young stellar populations , while the @xmath101 irac data measure the amplitude of the balmer break and constrain the properties of mature populations .",
    "we find that there is a wide variety of seds among these galaxies , such as mature galaxies with ages @xmath7 myr and young galaxies with ages @xmath103 myr .",
    "the dust extinction is low to moderate , consistent with the general trend that higher - redshift galaxies have bluer uv continuum slope and lower dust extinction @xcite .",
    "based on these results , our model parameters are set as follows . at a given redshift ( from 5.5 to 7.2 ) , we choose to use a mixed grid of six ages [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 40 , 100 ] myr and three dust extinction values e(b  v ) = [ 0.02 , 0.1 , 0.3 ] .",
    "the metallicity for the models with ages of 1 and 2 myr is 0.005 @xmath104 , for the models of with ages of 5 and 10 myr is 0.02 @xmath104 , and for the models of with ages of 40 and 100 myr is 0.2 @xmath104 .",
    "the selection function is not sensitive to these physical parameters such as age , metallicity , and dust extinction .",
    "after we generate the galaxy continuum spectra using the @xcite model , we add ly@xmath4  emission lines to the spectra .",
    "the ly@xmath4  emission in our galaxies is strong , and has significant contribution ( @xmath105 mag ) to the @xmath3-band photometry . as we discussed in section 3 ,",
    "we know very little about the statistics of ly@xmath4  strengths at @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we assume that the rest - frame ews of ly@xmath4  at @xmath22 have a distribution similar to that of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the selection function as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath50 .",
    "the contours in the figure are selection probabilities from 5% to 35% with an interval of 5% .",
    "the sharp decrease of the probability at @xmath22 is due to the color cut of @xmath96 .",
    "the solid circles are the locations of the 19 @xmath0 galaxies in our sample .",
    "figure 4 does not include two small constant incompletenesses .",
    "one is from slit conflict during deimos slit assignment ; @xmath106% candidates were not allocated slits .",
    "the other one is due to the existence of strong sky oh lines ; emission lines that happen to be on these oh lines are much more difficult to identify .",
    "although in principle this incompleteness is also a function of magnitude and redshift , we find that 5% is a good approximation for our sample in the range of 85009000    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure 4 does not take into account the rejection of @xmath28 laes either , otherwise there will be a ` dip ' at @xmath28 in the selection function of figure 4 .",
    "we derive the volume density of the galaxies at @xmath0 using the traditional @xmath107 method .",
    "the available volume for a galaxy with absolute magnitude @xmath76 and redshift @xmath50 in a magnitude bin @xmath108 and a redshift bin @xmath109 is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the probability function used to correct for all the sample incompletenesses described above .",
    "then the spatial density and its statistical uncertainty can be written as @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number of galaxies in the bin ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the magnitude and redshift distributions of the galaxies in our sample are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we measure galaxy densities in one redshift bin @xmath115 and three magnitude bins [ 19.4 , 20.4 ] , [ 20.4 , 21.4 ] , and [ 21.4 , 23 ] .",
    "the lower limits of redshift and magnitude are chosen to be our detection limit ( probability in figure 4 below 5% ) .",
    "the magnitude upper limit 23 of the last bin is an assumption , comparable to the brightest lbg candidates in the largest lbg sample of @xcite .",
    "we choose 6.5 as our upper limit of redshift because we were not able to identify lbg candidates at @xmath116 ( see subsection 4.5 for discuss ) and the laes at @xmath16 are being targeting in another program ( see section 2 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows our measurements of the spatial densities ( the filled circles with error bars ) in the three magnitude bins at @xmath12 .",
    "it also compares with the uv lfs at @xmath117 , 5.9 , and 6.8 from other studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a large sample of lbg candidates from the hudf and other @xmath19 datasets .",
    "they derived the uv lfs at @xmath117 and 5.9 ( the blue and green dashed lines in figure 5 ) down to a depth of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , and found very steep faint - end slopes ( @xmath120 ) at these redshifts .",
    "@xcite extended the @xmath19 sample by including brighter lbg candidates selected from the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) .",
    "they found very similar lfs at @xmath121 and 6 ( the blue and green dotted lines in figure 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath122 lfs in figure 5 were measured with the data from the new @xmath19 wfc3 ir camera @xcite and with the deep sdf @xmath123-band imaging data @xcite .",
    "it is clear that our spectroscopic result is in good agreement with the trend of the lfs from @xmath124 to 6.8 from the previous studies .",
    "note that k - correction within a small uv wavelength range ( @xmath125  ) is negligible because of the blue uv slopes .",
    "we parametrize the galaxy uv lf at @xmath22 from our spectroscopic sample using a schechter function , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the normalization , @xmath128 is the characteristic luminosity , and @xmath4 is the faint - end slope . because our sample is not deep enough to well determine @xmath4 , and the measurements of @xmath4 at @xmath129 from previous studies are quite robust and consistent , we fix @xmath4 to the value of 1.74 given by @xcite .",
    "we then fit our data to the above function .",
    "the best fits are @xmath130 and @xmath131 , consistent with the result of @xcite ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) and the result of @xcite ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) at @xmath22 .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath136 indicates that our sample spans a large luminosity range @xmath137 across the characteristic luminosity @xmath138 at @xmath139 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 5 .",
    "cosmic variance has a minor effect on our results .",
    "the six masks covered different parts of sdf , and we did not exclusively target denser regions of the lbgs candidates .",
    "we covered 79 candidates in 340 arcmin@xmath23 , while we selected 196 promising candidates in the whole sdf field ( @xmath140 arcmin@xmath23 ) .",
    "the candidate surface density in the six masks ( @xmath141 ) is close to the average density of the field ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "therefore our sample is a representative sample of sdf .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty originating from cosmic variance for all the sdf candidates using the @xcite calculator . within a redshift range of @xmath115",
    "the uncertainty is only @xmath143 % , much smaller than statistical errors in @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "our galaxy sample is a well - defined spectroscopic sample of lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison in figure 5 shows that our measurement of the uv lf at @xmath22 are consistent with the results from deep @xmath19 and ukidss observations . however , our lf largely depends on the selection function described in figure 4 .",
    "our tests show that the selection function is not sensitive to the physical parameters such as age , metallicity , and dust extinction , but is sensitive to the distribution of ly@xmath4  ews .",
    "because the fraction of strong laes among lbgs is small , we have applied a large correction in the selection function .",
    "figure 5 may indicate that the distribution of ly@xmath4  strength at @xmath22 is similar to that at @xmath90 .",
    "otherwise our lf will be quite diffirent from the previous measurments of the @xmath22 lfs .",
    "alternatively , the contamination rates in previous lbg samples should be small .",
    "for example , the contamination rate in the @xcite sample was claimed to be as small as @xmath57 % , and in the @xcite sample was found to be less than 14 % .",
    "if their contamination rates are higher , the number densities derived from their samples will be lower , in contrary to figure 5 .",
    "we also derive the ly@xmath4  lf using the way very similar to what we do for the uv lf .",
    "the ly@xmath4  luminosites @xmath144(ly@xmath4 ) are listed in table 1 .",
    "we first calculate the selection function to correct for incompleteness for our galaxies as a sample of laes .",
    "simulated galaxies are generated using the @xcite synthesis model as discrbied in section 4.2 .",
    "the only difference is the assumption of the ly@xmath4  ew distribution .",
    "the statistics of ly@xmath4   strengths in laes at @xmath22 has been determined in several studies .",
    "we use the ew probability distribution estimated from a sample of photometrically selected laes of @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the lae selection function as a function of @xmath144(ly@xmath4 ) and @xmath50 .",
    "the contours in the figure are selection probabilities from 10% to 70% with an interval of 10% .",
    "the selection function is generally similar to the one for lbgs in figure 4 , except that the selection probabilities for laes are more than three times higher than those for lbgs .",
    "this is because for laes we do not need to apply a large correction due to the small fraction laes among lbgs .",
    "the volume densities of the laes are computed in four luminosity ( log@xmath145 ) bins [ 42.35 , 42.60 ] , [ 42.60 , 42.85 ] , [ 42.85 , 43.10 ] , and [ 43.10 , 43.50 ] .",
    "the lower limit 42.35 of the first bin is chosen to be our detection limit ( probability in figure 6 below 5% ) .",
    "the brightest bin contains only one galaxy and the bin size is arbitrary , so we do not include this bin in the following analysis .",
    "we estimate the ly@xmath4  lf using a schechter function , @xmath146 most galaxies in our sample cover the faint end of the ly@xmath4  lf , so we are not able to well determine @xmath147",
    ". therefore we fix log@xmath147 to be the value of 43.0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when we fit our data to the above function .",
    "the best fits are @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "figure 7 shows our measurements of the densities ( filled circles with error bars ) and the best model fit ( solid curve ) .",
    "as we mentioned , the selection function is sensitive to the ly@xmath4  ew distribution , especially in the faint end of the sample .",
    "the filled triangles in figure 7 represent the volume densities if the assumed ew distribution is increased by 30   ( to roughly match the ew distribution for the spectroscopic sample shown in @xcite ) . the density in the faintest bin",
    "is increased by a factor of two . in figure 7",
    "we also show the comparison with the ly@xmath4  lf measurements at @xmath28 from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite agree with each other in a wide luminosity range covered .",
    "the result of @xcite also agrees with them in the bright end of the lf , but show a significant discrepancy in the faint end , where the density of @xcite is about three times lower .",
    "the reason is still unclear .",
    "our lf in the faint end is slightly higher than that of @xcite , but is lower than the @xcite and @xcite lfs .",
    "given the large uncertainties our result is generally in agreement with these previous lae surveys .",
    "the most distant galaxy in our sample is at @xmath150 , and we did not find any galaxies at @xmath116 .",
    "the reason is complicated .",
    "the deep @xmath3-band image used in this paper has securely detected one of the most distant laes known at @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "we successfully recovered this object during our candidate selection , and we also have six good @xmath116 candidates that have been observed . if they were galaxies like the @xmath151 lae , we should have identified them in the deimos mask images .",
    "this is illustrated in figures 4 and 6 .",
    "the detection probability of the @xmath151 lae is higher than those for a half of the lbgs or laes in our sample .",
    "however , the throughput of deimos drops steadily from 9000    towards higher wavelength , and in this range the sky background is brighter and the oh lines are denser .",
    "these issues result in significantly lower signal - to - noise ratios in the deimos images , but they were not considered in figures 4 and 6 .",
    "therefore it is likely that our spectra at @xmath152   are not deep enough to identify ly@xmath4  emisson lines . on the other hand",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that there are no @xmath116 lbgs with strong ly@xmath4   emission in the covered region . due to the increasing neutral fraction of igm at @xmath0 , the density of laes at the bright end may decline rapidly towards higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have reported the discovery of 19 lbgs from our deep spectroscopic observations of a sample of @xmath0 lbg candidates in sdf .",
    "the candidates were selected using the traditional dropout technique from an ultra - deep @xmath3-band image .",
    "this image , with a total integration time of 29 hours , enables us to select galaxies down to @xmath2 mag over a wide field .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopy was made with keck deimos .",
    "the 19 lbgs span a redshift range of @xmath67 and a magnitude range of @xmath68 .",
    "they have moderate ly@xmath4  emission line strengths compared to those in laes at similar redshifts .",
    "the median value of rest - frame ly@xmath4  ews is @xmath6  , and four lbgs have ews @xmath7  .",
    "this well - defined spectroscopic lbg sample spans a uv luminosity range of @xmath9 across the uv characteristic luminosity @xmath153 and a ly@xmath4  luminosity range of @xmath11 across the ly@xmath4  characteristic luminosity @xmath154 .",
    "it thus provides unique constraints on both the uv and ly@xmath4  lfs at @xmath0 .",
    "we correct for sample incompleteness from source detection , galaxy candidate selection , and spectroscopic identification .",
    "in particular , for the uv lf we assume that the distribution of ly@xmath4  ews at @xmath22 is the same as that at @xmath90 .",
    "we then calculate the volume density of the galaxies and estimate the lfs at @xmath12 using a schechter function .",
    "we find that our measurement of the uv lf is consistent with the results of previous studies based on photometric lbg samples at @xmath13 , including samples from hdf and ukidss udf .",
    "our ly@xmath4  lf is also in agreement with the results of ly@xmath4-emitter surveys at @xmath14 and 6.6 .",
