    "increasing the thickness makes it energetically favorable to form flux closure domains , and already at a thickness of 30 nm some of the particles were found to be in such multi domain states .",
    "this means that to make sure the magnetic elements are in single domain states , one has to keep the film thickness well below 30 nm for ellipses of the dimensions we have investigated . having a single domain state allows us to use an analytical macrospin model to investigate the ferromagnetic resonance properties of the system .",

    "a schematic of the model including edge defects is shown in fig .",

    ", the samples were defined by ion beam milling .",
    "this can affect the magnetic properties of the sample @xcite , and a more disordered edge region could lead to an increased damping of the fmr modes .",

    ", width=283,height=377 ]    in the initial simulation model with ideal edges , excited spin waves would be reflected at the edges of the sample .",
    "this explains the multiple excitation modes observed in the simulations , due to a hybridization of the main mode with other spin - wave modes @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : edgedefects]a ) . as a disordered edge region could lead to increased damping of the fmr modes , we introduced an edge region where the damping was increased from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "this would absorb the propagation of spin waves , reducing the spin - wave reflection at the sample edges . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgedefects]d , the increased damping lead to a broadening of the fmr modes , and suppress some of the splitting of the main mode .",
    "the low frequency edge mode however , remains relatively unaffected .",
    "the edge magnetization @xmath32 was found to be the most important parameter , and we made simulation models where the outer region of the ellipse had a significantly reduced @xmath32 from @xmath17 a / m to @xmath78 a / m . reducing @xmath32 in the edge region changes the fmr spectrum considerably , as seen when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : edgedefects]a and c. the splitting of the main mode is suppressed , and the resonance frequency of the edge mode is shifted significantly .",
    "the resulting spectrum now resembles the experimental data , showing mainly two parallel dispersing modes .",
    "another important effect to consider in arrays of nanomagnets is the dipolar interaction among the individual particles . in order to take this into account , we performed simulations for arrays of interacting ellipses .",
    "the simulations so far have been performed for single ellipses . however , due to the periodic array of ellipses ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a ) , there will be some degree of dipolar interaction between the individual ellipses .",
    "the dipolar interaction in arrays of magnetic particles can have both static and dynamic contributions .",
    "the effects of static dipolar interaction on the magnetization reversal of the same samples have been investigated previously , and an interaction field in the order of tens of mt was found @xcite .",
    "the dynamic interaction can couple the magnetization dynamics of adjacent dots through the stray field generated by the precessing magnetization , forming collective spin excitations in the system @xcite .",
    "interactions were included in the simulations by using periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , with the same periodicity as that indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a . in the limit of strong dipolar interaction",
    ", one could also expect collective modes in the system",
    ". a simple model of a single ellipse with periodic b.c . would not be sufficient to resolve such modes , as the neighboring ellipses could rotate either in phase ( acoustic mode ) or out of phase ( optic mode ) @xcite . to take this into account , we compared the simulation results for a single ellipse with periodic b.c . versus arrays of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ellipses . comparing the simulated fmr spectrums for the various array sizes , we found no indication of such collective modes in our system . in the following simulations",
    "the dipolar interaction was thus taken into account by using a simple model for a single ellipse with periodic b.c .    comparing the simulated spectrums for a single ellipse versus an array of ellipses",
    ", we found that the dipolar interaction changes the effective field felt by the individual ellipses . at zero applied field",
    ", the magnetization is oriented along the long axis of the ellipses . the overall dipolar field caused by the array geometry",
    "will then oppose the magnetization direction .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : final_model]a , the dipolar field reduces the resonance frequency at zero applied field for the array compared to a single ellipse . increasing the field along the short axis of the ellipse ,",
    "the magnetization will reorient itself along the short axis at an applied field of approx .",
    "75 mt ( seen as a `` dip '' in the fmr spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgedefects]c ) . at fields above this switching field ,",
    "the dipolar interaction acts to increase the effective magnetic field felt by the ellipses , and thus increases the fmr frequency .",
    "these shifts can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : final_model]a for an applied field between 150 mt - 350 mt , and are in the order of 1 ghz . these shifts in the fmr frequencies along the hard / easy axis are similar to those observed by carlotti",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who studied the effects of dipolar interactions in arrays of rectangular permalloy dots .    to capture all significant effects we thus made a simulation model with periodic b.c . , where edge defects were modelled as a reduced @xmath32 at the sample edges",
    "after including both edge defects and dipolar interactions , one can compare the simulated and experimental spectrums in fig .",
    "[ fig : final_model]b and c.        we notice that the inclusion of edge defects and dipolar interactions give a better agreement between the simulated and experimental fmr spectrum .",
    "as expected , the edge modes are strongly influenced by edge defects in the samples . to accurately capture the behavior of all the fmr modes ,",
    "it is thus important to take edge defects into account in the simulation model . due to the large spacing between the individual ellipses in the array ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is quite weak . in the simulations we observe a small shift in the fmr frequencies , but not any indications of collective modes between neighboring ellipses .",
    "the fact that the amplitude of the main mode dominates in the experiments , together with the weak dipolar coupling , explains the good agreement between the analytical macrospin model and experimental data .",
    "this indicates that in the limit of weak dipolar interaction , our macrospin model can be used to estimate the fmr frequency of the main mode in magnetic elements within the investigated size range ( e.g. in a single domain state ) .",
    "using an analytical macrospin model compared to performing numerical simulations simplifies the analysis considerably .",
    "the various energy terms contributing to the fmr dynamics can then be separated , and their relative importance investigated .",
    "in this study we have investigated how the combined interplay between shape anisotropy and crystalline anisotropy affects the magnetodynamic properties of confined magnetic elements .",
    "we have shown how the dimensions of the magnetic elements can be used to balance crystalline and shape anisotropies , and that this can be used to tailor the magnetodynamic properties    we have shown that a simple macrospin model for the fmr frequency gives good agreement with the experimental results for the main fmr mode . comparing experimental data and model calculations ,",
    "we show how changing the sample size affects the magnetodynamic properties . for the smallest ellipses ,",
    "shape anisotropy is dominating , whereas for the largest ellipses crystalline anisotropy is the dominating energy term . from eq.([eq : res4 ] ) , the relative contributions to the resonance frequency from crystalline and shape anisotropy is given by : @xmath82 , determined by the anisotropy field @xmath58 , the saturation magnetization @xmath32 and the demagnetization factors @xmath39 .",
    "this means that for the case of a 10 nm thick epitaxial fe film , one has an intermediate regime between approximately 50 nm to 1 @xmath83 m where one can use the sample size as an additional tuning parameter for the dynamic properties . for other materials with a different @xmath58 and @xmath32 ,",
    "this regime can be shifted to smaller / larger sample sizes .",
    "the effects of non ideal sample edges and dipolar interaction in the array of ellipses were investigated using micromagnetic simulations .",
    "we found that edge defects in the form of a reduced edge magnetization had to be included in the micromagnetic model , and that this needs to be taken into account in understanding the full fmr spectrum .",
    "the static dipolar interaction in the array was found to shift the fmr frequency in the order of 1 ghz compared to that of a single ellipse . from the simulated fmr spectrums we found no indications of collective spin excitations due to the dynamic dipolar interaction between neighboring ellipses .",
    "the tunability of the relative contributions from crystalline and shape anisotropies means that by changing the material parameters and sample size one can tailor the magnetodynamic properties of the magnetic elements , which could be of importance for magnonics applications .",
