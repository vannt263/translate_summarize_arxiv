    "the birth of the hot big - bang model dates back to the work of gamow and his collaborators in the 1940s . the emergence of the hot big - bang as the standard cosmology began in the late 1960s , with the discovery of the microwave background radiation , the establishment of its black - body spectrum , and the success of big - bang nucleosynthesis . by the 1970s ,",
    "the hot big - bang was being referred to as the standard cosmology .",
    "today , it is well established and provides an accounting of the universe from a fraction of a second after the beginning when the universe was a hot , smooth soup of quarks and leptons to the present , some @xmath1 later .",
    "the standard cosmology rests upon three strong observational pillars : the expansion of the universe ; the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) ; and the abundance pattern of the light elements , d , @xmath2he , @xmath3he , and @xmath4li , produced seconds after the bang ( see e.g. , peebles et al , 1991 ) .",
    "the standard cosmology leaves fundamental questions unexplained : the matter / antimatter asymmetry , the origin of the smoothness and flatness of the universe , the nature and origin of the primeval density inhomogeneities that seeded all the structure in the universe , the quantity and composition of the dark matter that holds the universe together , and the nature of the big - bang event itself .",
    "this has motivated the search for a more expansive cosmological theory .    in the 1980s , a new paradigm emerged ,",
    "deeply rooted in fundamental physics with the potential to extend our understanding of the universe back to @xmath0 and to address the fundamental questions poised by the hot big - bang model .",
    "that paradigm , known as inflation + cold dark matter , holds that most of the dark matter consists of slowly moving elementary particles ( cold dark matter ) , that the universe is flat and that the density perturbations that seeded all the structure seen today arose from quantum mechanical fluctuations on scales of @xmath5 or smaller .",
    "it took awhile for the observers and experimentalists to take this theory seriously enough to try to disprove it , and in the 1990s it began to be tested in a serious way .",
    "1998 could prove to be a watershed year in cosmology , as important as 1964 , when the cbr was discovered .",
    "the crucial new data include a precision measurement of the density of ordinary matter and of the total amount of matter , both derived from a measurement of the primeval deuterium abundance and the theory of bbn ; and the first fine - scale ( down to @xmath6 ) measurements of the anisotropy of the cbr ; and a measurement of the deceleration of the universe based upon distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne1a ) out to redshift of close to unity .",
    "together , these measurements , which are harbingers for the precision era of cosmology that is coming , provide the first plausible , complete accounting of the matter / energy density in the universe and evidence that the primeval density perturbations arose from quantum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "in addition , there exists a body of evidence in support of the cold dark matter theory of structure formation .",
    "the accounting of matter and energy goes like this ( in units of the critical density ) : light neutrinos , at least 0.3% ; bright stars and related material , 0.5% ; baryons , 5% ; cold dark matter , 35% ; and vacuum energy ( or something similar ) , 60% ; for a total equalling the critical density ( see fig .  1 ) . the recently measured primeval deuterium abundance ( burles & tytler , 1998 ) and the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis accurately determine the baryon density ( schramm & turner , 1998 ) , @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) . using the cluster baryon fraction , determined from x - ray measurements , @xmath9 ( evrard , 1996 ) , and assuming that clusters provide a fair sample of matter in the universe ,",
    "@xmath10 , it follows that @xmath11 . that @xmath12 is strong evidence for nonbaryonic dark matter ; the leading candidates are axions , neutralinos and neutrinos .",
    "the position of the first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the cbr is a sensitive indicator of the curvature of the universe : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "measurements now span multipole number @xmath15 to around @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ; while the data do not yet speak definitively , it is clear that @xmath17 is preferred .",
    "several experiments have new results around @xmath18 , and should be reporting them soon .",
    "ultimately , the map ( launch in 2000 ) and planck ( launch in 2007 ) satellites will cover @xmath15 to @xmath19 with precision limited essentially by sampling variance , and should determine @xmath20 to a precision of 1% or better .    the same angular power spectrum that indicates @xmath21 also provides evidence that the primeval density perturbations are of the kind predicted by inflation .",
    "the inflation - produced gaussian curvature fluctuations lead to an angular power spectrum with a series of well defined acoustic peaks . while the data at best define the first peak , they are good enough to exclude models where the density perturbations are isocurvature ( e.g. , cosmic strings and textures ) : in these models the predicted spectrum is devoid of acoustic peaks ( allen et al , 1997 ; pen et al , 1997 ) .",
    "the oldest approach to determining @xmath20 is by measuring the deceleration of the expansion .",
    "sandage s deceleration parameter , @xmath22 $ ] , depends upon both @xmath20 and the equation of state .",
    "accurate measurements of the ( luminosity ) distance as a function of redshift allow the deceleration to be determined .",
    "accurate distant measurements to some fifty or so sne1a , with redshifts as large as one , carried out by two groups ( riess et al , 1998 ; perlmutter et al , 1998 ) indicate that the universe is speeding up , not slowing down ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the simplest explanation is a cosmological constant , with @xmath24 .",
    "this result fits neatly with the cbr determination that @xmath25 and dynamical measures that indicate @xmath26 : the `` missing energy '' exists in a smooth component that can not clump and thus is not found in clusters of galaxies .",
    "while the evidence for inflation + cold dark matter is not definitive and we should be cautious , 1998 could well mark a turning point in cosmology as important as 1964 .",
    "recall , after the discovery of the cbr it took a decade or more to firmly establish the cosmological origin of the cbr and the hot big - bang cosmology as the standard cosmology .",
    "inflation has revolutionized the way cosmologists view the universe and provides the current working hypothesis for extending the standard cosmology .",
    "it explains how a region of size much , much greater than our hubble volume could have become smooth and flat without recourse to special initial conditions ( guth 1981 ) , as well as the origin of the density inhomogeneities needed to seed structure ( hawking , 1982 ; starobinsky , 1982 ; guth & pi , 1982 ; and bardeen et al , 1983 ) .",
    "inflation is based upon well defined , albeit speculative physics  the semi - classical evolution of a weakly coupled scalar field  and this physics",
    "may well be connected to the unification of the particles and forces of nature",
    ".    it would be nice if there were a standard model of inflation , but there is nt .",
    "what is important , is that almost all inflationary models make three very testable predictions : flat universe , nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gaussian density perturbations , and nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "these three predictions allow the inflationary paradigm to be decisively tested .",
    "while the gravitational waves are an extremely important and challenging test , i do not have space to mention them again here ( see e.g. , turner 1997 ) .",
    "the tremendous expansion that occurs during inflation is key to its beneficial effects and robust predictions : a small , subhorizon - sized bit of the universe can grow large enough to encompass the entire observable universe and much more . because all that we can see today was once so extraordinarily small , it appears flat and smooth .",
    "this is unaffected by the expansion since then and so the hubble radius today is much , much smaller than the curvature radius , implying @xmath27 .",
    "lastly , the tremendous expansion stretches quantum fluctuations on truly microscopic scales ( @xmath28 ) to astrophysical scales ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the curvature perturbations created by inflation are characterized by two important features : 1 ) they are almost scale - invariant , which refers to the fluctuations in the gravitational potential being independent of scale  and not the density perturbations themselves ; 2 ) because they arise from fluctuations in an essentially noninteracting quantum field , their statistical properties are that of a gaussian random field .    scale invariance specifies the dependence of the spectrum of density perturbations upon scale .",
    "the normalization ( overall amplitude ) depends upon the specific inflationary model ( i.e. , scalar - field potential ) . ignoring numerical factors for the moment",
    ", the fluctuation amplitude is given by : @xmath30 .",
    "( the amplitude of the density perturbation on a given scale at horizon crossing is equal to the fluctuation in the gravitational potential @xmath31 . ) to be consistent with the cobe measurement of cbr anisotropy on the @xmath32 scale , @xmath31 must be around @xmath33 .",
    "not only did cobe produce the first evidence for the existence of the density perturbations that seeded all structure ( smoot et al , 1992 ) , but also , for a theory like inflation that predicts the shape of the spectrum of density perturbations , it provides the overall normalization that fixes the amplitude of density perturbations on all scales .",
    "the cobe normalization began precision testing of inflation .",
    "as we look forward to the abundance ( avalanche ! ) of high - quality observations that will test inflation + cdm , we have to make sure the predictions of the theory match the precision of the data . in so doing , cdm",
    "+ inflation becomes a ten ( or more ) parameter theory . for astrophysicists , and especially cosmologists ,",
    "this is daunting , as it may seem that a ten - parameter theory can be made to fit any set of observations .",
    "this is not the case when one has the quality and quantity of data that will be coming .",
    "the standard model of particle physics offers an excellent example : it is a nineteen - parameter theory and because of the high - quality of data from experiments at fermilab s tevatron , slac s slc , cern s lep and other facilities it has been rigorously tested and the parameters measured to a precision of better than 1% in some cases . my worry as an inflationist is not that many different sets of parameters will fit the upcoming data , but rather that no set of parameters will !    in fact",
    ", the ten parameters of cdm + inflation are an opportunity rather than a curse : because the parameters depend upon the underlying inflationary model and fundamental aspects of the universe , we have the very real possibility of learning much about the universe and inflation .",
    "the ten parameters can be organized into two groups : cosmological and dark - matter ( dodelson et al , 1996 ) .    _ cosmological parameters _    1 .",

    "further , small  but nonzero  neutrino masses are a generic prediction of theories that unify the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions  and the super - kamiokande collaboration has presented evidence that the at least one of the neutrino species has a mass of greater than about 0.1ev , based upon the deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos ( fukuda et al , 1998 ) .",
