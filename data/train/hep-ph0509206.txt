    "one of the surprises which has emerged from the heavy ion experiments at rhic is that the medium or plasma which is produced in a heavy ion collision appears to display collective behavior analogous to a fluid with a very small viscosity ( the so - called `` quark - gluon liquid '' ) @xcite . in particular",
    ", hydrodynamic treatments taking the medium to be an ideal fluid give the correct flow description @xcite . to clarify ,",
    "we remind the reader that `` ideal fluid '' is the opposite of `` ideal gas '' ; it means that scatterings or interactions so efficiently maintain local equilibrium ( or at least isotropy ) , that the stress tensor remains everywhere isotropic when measured in the local rest frame .",
    "gases behave like ideal fluids on distance and time scales large compared to transport mean free paths and mean free times .",
    "the most popular , and perhaps most likely , explanation for the small viscosity is that the quark - gluon plasma at the energy densities achieved at rhic is very far from weak coupling .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath2 is large , interactions are very strong , and the collective behavior is natural . to secure this interpretation , we would need to see that the observed behavior really differs from the expected weakly coupled behavior .",
    "most treatments to date of weakly coupled hot qcd show that equilibration is slow @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have recently shown @xcite that even the most complete of these , the `` bottom - up '' scenario of baier , mueller , schiff and son @xcite , is incorrect , because it ignores plasma instabilities @xcite , which in fact dominate the physics of weakly - coupled anisotropic plasmas , in qcd or in ordinary qed .",
    "plasma instabilities arise as a result of two pieces of physics .",
    "first , lorentz contraction of the nuclei means that the initial region of plasma is a flat pancake shape .",
    "it is reasonable to expect at weak coupling that quarks and gluons will for a time fly in nearly straight lines at near the speed of light ( at least , once the system has expanded enough that the densities of quarks and gluons are perturbative ) .",
    "consider particles scattered in all directions in the initial moments of the collision .",
    "the starting geometry dictates that the momentum distribution of particles will subsequently become highly anisotropic with time , as illustrated in fig .",
    "second , in the presence of such anisotropic momentum distributions , certain soft gauge field configurations grow exponentially , at least if they are small enough for a perturbative treatment to be reliable .",
    "= 0.9    not only have plasma instabilities not been fully taken into account in studying the evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ; instabilities in yang - mills theory in general are not yet well understood or well characterized .",
    "therefore , at the current juncture we can not say whether the experimental results at rhic are in contradiction with weakly coupled predictions , because we simply do not know what the predictions of isotropization in a weakly coupled quark - gluon plasma actually are .",
    "this rather embarrassing gap in our knowledge needs to be filled .",
    "in particular , the behavior of plasma instabilities in a nonabelian theory such as qcd are expected to be intrinsically different from the case of an ordinary qed plasma , because nonabelian gauge fields can directly interact with each other , and because charge carriers can have their colors rotated by intervening qcd fields .",
    "recently there has been substantial progress on this problem , though it is far from settled .",
    "the growth of qcd plasma instabilities when the soft colored gauge fields are small has been well characterized @xcite .",
    "arnold and lenaghan @xcite conjectured that exponential growth would continue after qcd fields became large .",
    "1 + 1 dimensional simulations @xcite confirmed this behavior , but 3 + 1 dimensional studies @xcite showed something different : when soft colored gauge fields become large due to instability growth , exponential growth shuts off and the energy in soft gauge fields instead grows _ linearly _ with time .",
    "recent partial attempts to explore the consequences of instabilities for thermalization may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to further investigate the behavior of an anisotropic quark - gluon plasma , after soft gauge fields have become large .",
    "we will show that the soft gauge fields with wave - numbers which should make them unstable instead enter a dynamical quasi - steady state , gaining energy from the instability but losing energy , via their nonabelian interactions , to more ultraviolet field excitations .",
    "the energy released into infrared gauge fields by the instability then cascades towards higher wave - number gauge field modes , with occupation number @xmath3 up to a time - dependent cutoff @xmath4 . through simulations",
    ", we measure the spectral index to be @xmath1 .",
    "we will carry out a numerical study of nonabelian , classical yang - mills theory coupled to an anisotropic bath of high momentum particles .",
    "the numerical tools were already presented in detail in @xcite , and this paper is a continuation of that work . to make our presentation more",
    "self - contained , we will briefly review the setup and formalism here .",
    "our treatment is founded on two assumptions about the system under study .",
    "the first is that the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the second is that there is a separation of scales between the momentum of the typical excitation , @xmath6 , and the _ screening scale _ @xmath7 .",
    "the screening scale is set by the momentum @xmath6 and number density @xmath8 of the typical excitations as @xmath9 .",
    "the number density is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the occupancy of momentum state @xmath12 and @xmath13 is its angular average .",
    "therefore there is a scale separation @xmath7 provided that the angular - averaged occupancy @xmath13 of typical excitations is @xmath14 .",
    "this is essentially a diluteness condition on the typical excitations in the system .    in the context of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the condition @xmath5 is formally valid for the collision of extremely large and high - energy heavy ions @xcite .",
    "the initial angular - averaged occupancy is at most @xmath15 , which is the saturation limit @xcite , then the magnetic screening length they would provide would be larger than the imputed typical momentum .",
    "however , the concept of momentum for an excitation of a gauge dependent field is only well defined and robust under gauge fixing prescriptions to an accuracy set by the magnetic screening length .",
    "these ideas are central to the idea of the saturation scale .",
    "however this argument does not depend on the saturation scenario as such . ]",
    "( corresponding to number and energy densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "the density @xmath8 of the original particles , and so @xmath18 , will fall with time as the system expands .",
    "so the scale separation condition @xmath19 will be satisfied at least for @xmath20 ( up until the much later time when the particles of momentum @xmath6 lose their energy and the plasma thermalizes  see , for example , the discussion in the original bottom - up scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if we have a clean separation between the screening scale @xmath21 and typical momenta @xmath6 , then we can describe the physics on length scales @xmath22 in terms of ( i ) classical fields with wave vectors @xmath23 and ( ii ) a distribution of classical particles ( possessing well defined momenta and positions ) representing excitations with momenta @xmath24 .",
    "this is a vlasov equation treatment . with a little more work @xcite",
    ", one may work in terms of a classical field variable @xmath25 , a variable @xmath26 , which represents the net ( adjoint ) color of all particles moving in direction @xmath27 at point @xmath28 , and a background colorless particle density with angular distribution @xmath29 and polarizability characterized by a screening mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 with the sum over spin and particle type ( including anti - particles ) .",

    "@xmath38 is the plasma frequency .",
    "we argued in @xcite that the intrinsic length and time scales for the instability to develop are short compared to the length and time scales on which the heavy ion system as a whole evolves .",
    "therefore we will restrict our attention in this ( still somewhat exploratory ) study to a non - expanding system with spatially uniform @xmath39 .",
    "the evolution equations for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 \\omega(\\v ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equation is the yang - mills field equation , with @xmath43 giving rise to a current . the second equation , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , shows how electric and magnetic fields can polarize the colorless distribution of particles to create a net color moving in each direction .",
    "the dynamics of the soft fields is equivalent to that of hard - loop effective theory @xcite .    for a fully nonperturbative study of this system",
    ", we implement these equations on a lattice .",
    "the treatment of the classical , minkowski space gauge fields on the lattice is the standard one @xcite .",
    "the representation of the @xmath41 fields is developed in @xcite and consists of replacing first derivatives with forward - backwards ( covariantized ) differences in , and expanding the space of velocities @xmath27 in spherical harmonics , truncated at a finite but large @xmath44 . in this work",
    "we make one additional modification which improves approach to the @xmath45 limit and so reduces the memory and time requirements for simulations : we apply a weak damping term to the large @xmath46 spherical harmonic components of the @xmath41 field .",
    "the reason this is an improvement is that very large @xmath46 excitations of the @xmath41 field tend to cascade to still larger @xmath46 , due to the @xmath47 term in .",
    "term mixes neighboring @xmath46 s because @xmath48 has non - zero cases when @xmath49 .",
    "] with a finite @xmath44 cutoff , some of this excitation energy `` bounces off ''",
    "the @xmath44 cutoff and re - enters the infrared . this effect becomes smaller as @xmath44 is raised , but can be largely eliminated with the damping term we add .",
    "this point is discussed and justified in greater detail in appendix [ sec : damp ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand the behavior of a would - be unstable system after the unstable modes have already grown to have nonperturbative occupancy . in the context of a heavy ion collision",
    ", this is probably the only relevant question ; since the exponential growth rate is larger than the inverse system age for all times after the formation time of the plasma , there has always been time for unstable gauge field modes to grow to nonperturbative size .",
    "therefore we will begin our system with initial conditions for which the infrared ( ir ) fields are already nonperturbatively large .",
    "again , since this is a qualitative exploratory work , we will work in su(2 ) rather than su(3 ) gauge theory and we will only consider a single anisotropic particle distribution , the same as the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to our focus on large rather than small initial conditions , there are slight technical differences in our choice of initial conditions compared to those of ref .",
    "we start the system with vanishing @xmath50 and @xmath41 fields and with the @xmath51 field selected from the thermal ensemble at temperature @xmath52 , but then field - smeared to a scale @xmath53 .",
    "this is a gauge - invariant procedure which corresponds perturbatively to multiplying a thermal spectrum for @xmath54 by @xmath55 .",
    "we will explain the field smearing procedure below because it also constitutes one of our best measurables for understanding , in a gauge - invariant fashion , what corresponds to infrared phenomena and what to ultraviolet .",
    "our first conclusion , already presented in our previous paper @xcite , is that the energy in soft electromagnetic fields grows linearly with time .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin ] , which shows that the linear behavior is common to electric and magnetic fields and is robust to changes in the lattice spacing . however , this result leaves it unclear whether or not this represents continued growth of the soft unstable fields , whether these fields `` abelianize '' @xcite , and whether they retain long time scale coherence .",
    "we now present evidence that the answer to all three questions is , `` no . ''",
    "= 0.7      first , consider the behavior of chern - simons number , @xmath56 chern - simons number is useful because it characterizes nonperturbative physics . in an abelian theory , or a nonabelian theory where the fields are weak",
    ", @xmath57 may fluctuate about zero but can not drift away from zero permanently .",
    "that is because permanent change requires topology change ( the minkowski version of instantons ) .",
    "therefore , ignoring small fluctuations , the time evolution of @xmath57 is purely indicative of the dynamics of nonperturbatively large fields .",
    "fully topological algorithms for tracking @xmath57 in a real - time gauge field evolution already exist .",
    "we use the one from ref .",

    "a sample chern - simons number trajectory , from the @xmath58 evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin ] , is shown on the left in fig.[fig : ncs ] .",
    "chern - simons number is changing by large amounts ( indicating nonperturbatively large fields ) , and in a chaotic fashion ( indicating that the fields have no long time - scale stability ) .",
    "this means that the soft fields remain large , but evolve dynamically , changing on a time scale set by the scale @xmath59 . to see this better ,",
    "consider the auto - correlator @xmath60 , shown on the right in that figure .",
    "this correlator indicates over what time scale coherent changes to the gauge fields occur .",
    "the figure presented represents an average over time and over 10 independent initial conditions drawn from the same ensemble , using a @xmath61 lattice with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the errors were determined by the jackknife method .",
    "= 0.46 = 0.46    although we have not shown it in the figure , we have also checked that the evolution of @xmath57 does not speed up or slow down during the course of the linear rise in magnetic energy .",
    "for instance , comparing the first and second halves of the evolutions used to make fig.[fig : ncs ] , the chern - simons number diffusion rate ( sphaleron rate ) is consistent between the two halves to within @xmath64 error bars , and the full auto - correlator is also consistent within errors .",
    "what this tells us is that the ir fields truly are nonperturbative , that they evolve with a characteristic time scale of order @xmath65 , and that the time scale and the size of the nonperturbative fields is constant throughout the linearly growing regime .",
    "if ir fields are not growing , then the linear growth of magnetic energy must reflect growth of higher - momentum modes of the soft gauge field .",
    "to clarify the situation , it would be useful to know the power spectrum of the soft gauge fields as a function of wavenumber @xmath21 and time @xmath66 .",
    "we will start with a direct but gauge - dependent measurement of the power spectrum in coulomb gauge .",
    "later we will discuss how the spectrum can be accessed indirectly through gauge - invariant measurement involving smearing ( also known as cooling ) of the field configurations .",
    "our picture ( to be supported by data below ) is that , during the linear growth phase of the total energy in soft fields , the soft fields consist of ( i ) a non - perturbative ir component plus ( ii ) a perturbative component in the form of higher - momentum plasmons .",
    "we would like to know the distribution function @xmath67 of these plasmons as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we fix coulomb gauge using the standard algorithm @xcite adopted to the real - time case @xcite .",
    "then we ( i ) extract the fourier spectrum of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , ( ii ) evaluate the two point function , averaging over @xmath70 vectors in narrow blocks of @xmath71 , technically , we use the lattice @xmath72 , @xmath73 . and ( iii ) define the distribution function as determined by @xmath68 and as determined by @xmath69 through ) plasmons .",
    "this could be written in terms of @xmath74 as @xmath75 or in terms of the fields as @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 for such plasmons , and @xmath78 in coulomb gauge , we can also write the energy as @xmath79 or @xmath80 . comparison of these expressions leads to the identification ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "] @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the total spatial volume and @xmath83 accounts for the two transverse polarization states and the @xmath84 adjoint color states in su(2 ) gauge theory .    on scales where the fields are nonperturbatively large , these distribution functions are difficult to interpret , depending somewhat on the gauge fixing procedure .",
    "we do not expect @xmath85 to equal @xmath86 ; indeed , if the dominant fields are slowly evolving or unstable magnetic fields , we expect @xmath87 , perhaps by a large margin . on scales , presumably at larger @xmath21 , where the fields are perturbative , we should see @xmath88 if the relevant degrees of freedom are behaving as plasmons with @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath90 serves as a diagnostic of whether the physics is nonperturbative and whether the degrees of freedom are primarily independently propagating plasmons or something else , such as the magnetic fields associated with hard particle currents .    to test this , we evolved the system for a time of @xmath91 in a @xmath92 box with @xmath63 and lattice spacing @xmath93 , corresponding to a ( large ) physical volume of @xmath94 , tracking the distribution functions after the initial transient had died and the magnetic field energy was undergoing linear growth .",

    "in this appendix we argue that the large @xmath44 limit is achieved more quickly by applying weak damping on large @xmath46 modes than by not doing so , and we present numerical evidence that this is the case .    at the perturbative level ,",
    "the behavior of the isotropic version of the @xmath51 and @xmath41 field system has been investigated by bdeker , moore , and rummukainen @xcite .",
    "the correct analytic structure of the gauge field propagator in the presence of hard thermal loops ( the infinite @xmath44 , isotropic theory ) is that there should be a propagating `` plasmon '' pole at a frequency @xmath157 , and a cut in the spectral weight for all frequencies @xmath158 .",
    "physically , the cut reflects landau damping .",
    "it means that most of the energy of a long wavelength magnetic field should be absorbed by the particle degrees of freedom represented by the @xmath41 fields , never to return .",
    "however , the finite @xmath44 system is a non - dissipative hamiltonian system . therefore it is not possible for it to contain cuts in the ( leading order ) propagator .",
    "instead , the region which should contain the cut contains a series of poles and zeros in the propagator , illustrated in fig.[fig : propagator ] , which is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what this means is that the excitation energy present in the magnetic field , which is supposed to be landau damped away , instead appears only in periodic oscillatory modes .",
    "most of the energy is stored in the @xmath41 fields , as is supposed to happen under landau damping . however",
    ", a fraction of it periodically reappears as magnetic field energy , an effect which is unphysical .",
    "the size of this effect is determined by the number of @xmath41 field modes , @xmath159 , which sets the heat capacity of these modes to absorb and store excitation energy .",
    "the larger @xmath44 is , the more effectively the @xmath41 fields can retain the energy rather than feeding it back to the magnetic fields .",
    "the problem in the current context is that , in the anisotropic system , quite large amounts of @xmath41 field excitation are generated .",
    "the derivative term @xmath160 in should cause this excitation energy to migrate to higher and higher @xmath46 values .",
    "this is shown in the left - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : lvalue ] , which shows how @xmath161 varies with time and with @xmath46 , if we start with large magnetic fields but with no initial excitation in the @xmath41 fields",
    ". however , with a finite @xmath44 cutoff , the excitation can not migrate to arbitrarily large @xmath46 , as it should ; some of it instead moves back into lower @xmath46 and re - enters the gauge fields and small @xmath46 @xmath41 fields .",
    "this causes a fake increase in the energy of these fields , which becomes more severe as @xmath44 is decreased .      our approach to solve this problem is to assume that any excitation energy which reaches very large @xmath46 values should continue to arbitrarily large @xmath46 and be lost to the low @xmath46 system .",
    "we can make this happen artificially by applying a damping term to the highest @xmath46 modes , modifying the @xmath41 equation of motion via @xmath162 that is , we add a term which causes exponential shrinkage with rate @xmath163 in all @xmath46 at or above a cutoff @xmath164 .",
    "the damping should only affect the high @xmath46 modes , so we choose @xmath165 .",
    "note that the damping we apply is gauge invariant : so long as @xmath166 , the current remains exactly conserved , because the current is determined by the @xmath167 modes and the charge density by @xmath168 .",
    "we also have to choose a value for @xmath163 .",
    "if the value is too large , then the @xmath41 fields with @xmath169 are effectively forced to be zero , which is equivalent to lowering @xmath44 to @xmath164 .",
    "therefore we should choose @xmath170 , since @xmath171 is the intrinsic scale of the dynamics .",
    "we should also make sure we pick @xmath172 ; otherwise the damping is too slow to do anything , as excitation energy can get from @xmath164 to @xmath44 , reflect , and go back below @xmath164 before being damped away . with this in mind , we have chosen @xmath173 .    of course , it remains to test whether this procedure of damping large @xmath46 modes really gives the same behavior as choosing an extremely large value for @xmath44 ( which is numerically impractical , since the number of degrees of freedom rises as @xmath174 ) .",
    "to check , we have performed evolutions with the same initial random seed and other parameters but with different values of @xmath44 , and either with or without the damping term added .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : lmax ] for @xmath62 , @xmath175 , and the same @xmath39 used in the main body of the paper @xcite .",
    "on the left , we see magnetic energy growth vs.  time . with and without damping , the growth rates converge ( from opposite sides ) towards the same large @xmath44 limit .",
    "but the damped results converge much faster : with damping , the magnetic energy growth does not change between @xmath63 and @xmath176 , and appears to coincide with the very large @xmath44 , undamped behavior .",
    "now return to the flat result of fig .",
    "[ fig : jsmear ] for the time dependence of @xmath147 . on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : lmax ] , we see that this flat behavior is obtained only very gradually in the large @xmath44 limit unless damping is implemented , in which case it occurs immediately . for investigating current growth",
    ", damping is an essential numerical tool for practical simulations .",
    "naturally , if @xmath44 is too small , we will see errant behavior whether or not we implement damping . for the choice of @xmath39 used here ( _ i.e. _  for the degree of hard particle anisotropy in our simulations ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : lmax ] shows large deviation of the magnetic energy growth for @xmath44 below about 10 .",
    "we have therefore conservatively used @xmath63 for the bulk of the studies presented in the main text .",
