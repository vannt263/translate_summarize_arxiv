    "<S> covariant density functional theory based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) lagrangian with the parameter set nl3 has been used in the last ten years with great success . </S>",
    "<S> now we propose a modification of this parameter set , which improves the description of the ground state properties of many nuclei and simultaneously provides an excellent description of excited states with collective character in spherical as well as in deformed nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory is a universal and powerful tool for describing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table . in the non - relativistic framework </S>",
    "<S> the most successful density functionals are the ones based on density dependent forces , such as the skyrme  @xcite or the gogny  @xcite functional . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory was first introduced as a fully fledged quantum field theory by walecka  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turned out very soon  @xcite , that for a quantitative description of nuclear surface properties an additional density dependence is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays rmf theory modified in this form is considered as a covariant form of density functional theory . over the years </S>",
    "<S> it has gained considerable interest , in particular , for the description of nuclei at and far from stability @xcite . compared with non - relativistic density functionals covariant </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory has certain advantages . </S>",
    "<S> they are characterized by a new saturation mechanism obtained by a delicate balance between a strongly attractive scalar field and a strongly repulsive vector field . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the very large spin - orbit splitting , observed in finite nuclei , is a relativistic effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , its treatment in relativistic models arises in a natural way without any additional adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , time - odd mean fields which are important in systems with broken time reversal symmetry are uniquely defined in rmf theory because of the lorentz covariance of the underlying lagrangian  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> pairing properties are essential for a description of nuclei with open shells . they have been included first in the constant gap approximation by occupation numbers of bcs - type  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since this procedure requires the knowledge of the experimental pairing gaps , it can not be applied in unexplored regions of the nuclear chart , where the binding energies are not known . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is noted that the bcs approximation breaks down in nuclei far from the valley of stability , where the coupling to the continuum is essential  @xcite . therefore the constant gap approximation has been replaced by relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) theory  @xcite which includes a finite range particle - particle interaction of gogny form . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this theory have been discussed in several review articles  @xcite and in the references given there .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> the adopted functionals are considered universal in the sense that they can be used for nuclei all over the periodic table , where mean field theory is applicable . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore very desirable to find a unique parameterization for the lagrangian of the model , which is able to describe as many experimental data as possible . in other words , we search for an effective force that is able to describe properties of nuclei from light to very heavy , from the proton to the neutron drip line . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a powerful density functional should not only describe the ground state properties of finite nuclei but also , at the same time , collective excited states within time - dependent density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is crucial because otherwise , one would end up with one effective force for the description of the masses , another one for exotic systems , a third one for giant resonances an so on . definitely , such specific parameterizations do not serve the purposes of universal density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> their inability originates from the fact that they are tailored to describe either specific observables or narrow regions of the periodic chart .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ]    [ c]rrrrrrrr & exp . & nl3 & nl3@xmath0 & nl - sh & nl-1 & nl - z & nl - ra1 + gmr & @xmath1 & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath5 & @xmath6 & @xmath7 + gdr & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 +    there are several types of relativistic density functionals . </S>",
    "<S> conventional rmf theory is based on the walecka model , where the nucleons interact by the exchange of phenomenological mesons and , up to now , in all the successful relativistic models two additional assumptions are essential : ( i ) in _ the mean field approximation _ only the nucleonic fields are quantized and the nucleons move independently in classical mesons fields , depending in a self - consistent way on the nuclear densities and currents , and ( ii ) in the _ no - sea approximation _ vacuum polarization and the contributions of the negative energy solutions are not explicitly taken into account .    of course , the pure walecka model is unable to describe nuclear matter and finite nuclei in a quantitative way . </S>",
    "<S> the medium dependence induced by many - body correlations is not reproduced properly . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an effective density dependence , which can be taken into account either by non - linear self - interactions between the mesons or by a density dependence of the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> models with density dependent coupling constants are tailored more in the spirit of density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , they have turned out to be very successful  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are technically more complicated , in particular , for rpa calculations . on the other hand , non - linear models have some justification . in fact , the effects of vacuum polarization which can contribute up to 30 % to the resulting binding energies are not taken into account explicitly in the framework of the no - sea approximation , but only globally by adjusting the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> a proper renormalization procedure in nuclear matter @xcite and in finite nuclei @xcite leads to counterterms in the form of non - linear meson coupling . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> non - linear meson coupling theories seem at a first glance to be more appropriate for a phenomenological description of vacuum polarization as compared to those using density dependent coupling constants . of course , by adjustment of the final lagrangian to the same experimental data , both methods to introduce a density dependence lead to very similar results . </S>",
    "<S> however the details are different : non - linear meson couplings lead in the case of nuclear matter to density dependent meson masses , i.e. to density dependent range parameters of the force and no rearrangement terms in the dirac equation , whereas density dependent coupling constants lead to  density dependent strenght parameters of the effective force and additional rearrangement terms . </S>",
    "<S> so far such differences have not been investigated in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter set nl3 @xcite with non - linear meson couplings represents one of most successful non - linear rmf forces . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed ten years ago . in the meantime , new experimental data on nuclear masses have appeared . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> new and more reliable information about the neutron skin became available . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it was found that nl3 encounters some difficulties in describing light hg and pb isotopes  @xcite and certainly , there is always a need for better predictions of the masses which , of course , reflect also correct nuclear sizes . for this reason we decided to improve the parameter set nl3 by performing a new global fit of ground state properties of spherical nuclei and infinite nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> new parameterization obtained in this fit will be called nl3*.    in order to stay as close as possible to the very successful parameter set nl3 , we kept in this fit the functional form of the lagrangian unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the density dependence of the both parameter sets nl3 and nl3 * is determined by the non - linear meson couplings in the isoscalar channel @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss the adequacy of this ansatz at the end the this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) is a standard lagrangian density  @xcite @xmath15 which contains nucleons described by the dirac spinors @xmath16 with the mass @xmath17 and several relativistic fields characterized by the quantum numbers of spin , parity , and isospin . </S>",
    "<S> these are effective fields mediated by mesons , with no direct connection to mesons and resonances existing in free space . </S>",
    "<S> they only carry their quantum numbers and characterize the properties of the possible relativistic fields entering the effective dirac equation , which corresponds to the kohn - sham equation  @xcite in the non - relativistic case . </S>",
    "<S> it is only for simplicity that we use the conventional names @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we have the electromagnetic field @xmath24 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> there should also be an effective scalar meson with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the @xmath27-meson . </S>",
    "<S> it plays an important role in g - matrix calculations  @xcite . however , present phenomenological parameterizations of the relativistic energy density functional  @xcite are very successful without the inclusion of this meson . on the basis of present experimental data in finite nuclei </S>",
    "<S> it is very difficult to distinguish between effective scalar and vector mesons in the isospin @xmath28 channel , and , therefore , all the isospin dependence is carried by the effective @xmath22-meson .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , a non - terminating ground state band in @xmath91kr  @xcite ,  a smoothly - terminating band in @xmath92sb  @xcite , and an yrast superdeformed ( sd ) band in @xmath93eu  @xcite were selected for this comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing correlations are weak in these bands , and thus all calculations were performed within the framework of cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory  @xcite which neglects pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculations for rotational and deformation properties of the bands mentioned before are compared with experiment in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fige ] . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic ( @xmath94 ) and dynamic ( @xmath95 ) moments of inertia ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5a ) of the highly - deformed band in @xmath66cu as well as its transition quadrupole moment @xmath96 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5e ) are well described by the crmf calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the @xmath94 moment is considerably larger than the @xmath95 moment and that both moments smoothly decrease with rotational frequency are clear fingerprints that the pairing is not important at high spin  @xcite . while this condition is clearly satisfied in @xmath66cu ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5a ) , these moments are closer to each other in the case of the sd band in @xmath93eu ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b ) suggesting that the pairing is relatively more important in the later band . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we observe somewhat larger discrepancies between experiment and theory in the case of @xmath93eu ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the calculations would include weak pairing , this would lead to the decrease ( increase ) of calculated @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) moments of inertia bringing them closer to experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it is also necessary to mention that the sd band in @xmath93eu is not linked to the low - spin spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the effective alignment approach with respect of the linked yrast sd band in @xmath97dy  @xcite the spin of the initial state of this band has been suggested to be    @xmath98 : this value has been used in the plotting of experimental kinematic moment of inertia in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can not completely exclude also the value @xmath99 ( see discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ; this would increase experimental @xmath94 values bringing them closer to calculated ones . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational properties of the bands which come close to their maximum spin @xmath100 ( as defined from the distribution of particles / holes over low- and high-@xmath101 orbitals ) are usually analyzed employing excitation energies plotted versus rigid rotor reference . </S>",
    "<S> this type of analysis is used for the bands in @xmath92sb and @xmath91kr , see figs . 5c and 5d . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that at high spin above @xmath102 , where the pairing is expected to be weak , the crmf results describe the excitation energies very well . </S>",
    "<S> the band in @xmath92sb is a classical example of a smoothly terminating band ; it starts at low spin at near - prolate shape , then with increasing spin its shape becomes more and more triaxial and finally at @xmath103 it terminates in a non - collective oblate state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this process of smooth band termination is associated with the gradual loss of collectivity which is nicely seen in the drop of the transition quadrupole moment @xmath96 with increasing spin ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is nicely reproduced in the calculations . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state band in @xmath91kr reveals a new phenomenon of non - termination of rotational bands ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) : it remains collective at @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the case of the band in @xmath92sb , its transition quadrupole moment is more constant as a function of spin ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5f ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the crmf calculations with the parameter set nl3 * provide a very successful description of different aspects of rotating nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the results of the calculations are very close to the ones obtained earlier with the nl3 parameterization of the rmf lagrangian .    as mentioned above , the density dependence of the parameter sets nl3 and nl3 * is determined by the non - linear meson couplings in the isoscalar channel @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the vector fields @xmath20 and @xmath22 , in particular , the isovector channel described by the @xmath22-meson are still coupled linearly and this leads to relatively large neutron radii and a very stiff equation of state for neutron matter  @xcite as well as very stiff symmetry energies as a function of the density  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> models with non - linear couplings in the @xmath22-channel as for instance the parameter set fsugold introduced by piekarewicz in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can improve this , however at the cost of additional parameters . </S>",
    "<S> density dependent covariant functionals eliminate the non - linear coupling terms and use , instead of that , at the cost of additional parameters , density dependent coupling constants @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 which depend on the baryon density @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is evidently closer to the idea of density functional theory . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , one has to keep in mind that a proper treatment of the effects of vacuum polarization by a renormalization procedure would require counterterms which are nonlinear in the meson fields with the same polynomial structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , because of the relatively small surface diffuseness in nuclear systems and the narrow range , in which the density is changing from its value at saturation to zero , calculations of matrix elements with density dependent coupling constants and of the corresponding rearrangement terms require a considerably larger numerical effort , in particular , in the case of axially symmetric and triaxial applications . considering all these points the non - linear version of rmf theory is still a very useful concept because it combines simplicity with excellent predictions for many nuclear properties .    in conclusion , in the present work we have reconsidered the well known parameter set nl3 after ten years and by a new fit with modern experimental data we introduced an improved parameterization nl3 * for the rmf model , which contains only six phenomenological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is able to improve the description of nuclear masses and to cure some small problems observed previously with the nl3 force . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , it provides excellent results for collective properties of vibrational and rotational character . </S>"
