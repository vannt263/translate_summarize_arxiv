    "the astrophysical evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is well based on observations from the scales of galaxies , clusters and the universe itself , in the framework of the standard cosmological model .    despite the fact that the cosmological scenario where cosmological parameters fit a dark matter mainly non - baryonic and cold , a great debate has currently opened about the possibility that warm dark matter becomes a better candidate to understand the recent investigations . for a wide discussion based in the new results in the area see  @xcite .",
    "a summary of astrophysical constraints on dark matter is present in  @xcite    let us summarize some of the difficulties of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model",
    ". at galactic scales , n - body simulations of cosmological structures with cdm have predicted that the dark matter halos surrounding galaxies must present radial profiles of the mass density and velocity dispersion with a central cusp in which the value of the logarithmic slope is under discussion ( see  @xcite ) .    in the case of the _ missing satellites problem _",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite exists a discrepancy in the cold dark matter model between the predicted numbers of satellite galaxies inside the galactic halo for the milky way and lower number observed .",
    "this problem has been undertaken assuming a warm dark matter component in various works  @xcite .",
    "a recent investigation of n - body simulations in a warm dark matter scenario , which took into account the new dwarf spheroidal galaxies discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite , derived lower limits on the dark matter particle mass  @xcite .    in recent investigations ,",
    "the measuring of the dark matter equation of state ( eos ) has been carried out using different approaches . following a suggestion given in @xcite , where the method combines kinematic and gravitational lensing data ,",
    "the dark matter eos was measured in @xcite using galaxy clusters which present gravitational lensing effects .",
    "the result of this work indicates that the measured eos for dark matter is consistent with the standard pressureless cold dark matter at 1@xmath10 level .",
    "nevertheless , lensing analysis in clusters such as coma and cl0024 shows a trend to prefer an exotic eos for the dark matter , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "models of the dark matter component described by a fluid with non - zero effective pressure has been studied in some astrophysical scenarios . at galactic level",
    ", an eos with anisotropic pressures has been investigated in @xcite in order to explain flat rotation curves .",
    "a polytropic dark matter halo fits very well a number of elliptical galaxies , improving or at least giving similar results to the velocity dispersion profile compared to a stars - only model @xcite .",
    "explorations of the eos for dark matter at cosmological level have been carried out in various frameworks . in @xcite , a constant eos for dark matter",
    "is studied from the study of the power spectrum , assuming a cosmological constant as the dark energy fluid and a flat universe .",
    "the bounds obtained for @xmath0 were @xmath19 if there is no entropy production and @xmath20 if the adiabatic sound speed vanishes .",
    "phenomenologically , eos for both dark fluids have been studied in @xcite using wmap+bao+@xmath21 observations by synchronizing the model with the @xmath22 model at the present time .",
    "the dark matter component behaves like radiation at very early times and at the present time @xmath23 .    in the case of unified dark matter models , where a single matter component is assumed to source the acceleration and structure formation @xcite , the initial phase is described by a cold dark matter so that the fitting with cosmological data leads to a late phase with negative @xmath0 very close to a cosmological constant or phantom matter .",
    "our aim in this work is to study the eos of the dark matter component allowing a non zero value for @xmath0 from the beginning and then to undertake a constraining of its value using the latest observations that measure the expansion history of the universe . in what follows",
    ", we will assume a barotropic eos for this component .",
    "of course , this assumption is rather restrictive because in approaches based in the nature of particles constituting the dark matter fluid is expected to have a @xmath0 varying with the cosmological time .",
    "such is the case , for example , for dark matter bose - einstein condensation @xcite . nevertheless , if the dark matter fluid is modeled , in the non - relativistic approximation , as a non - degenerated ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas , a barotropic eos is obtained with @xmath24 constant @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly outline the basic equations of evolution of the model . in section iii",
    ", the parameters of the model are constrained using cosmological data from type ia supernovae , cmbr , baryon acoustic oscillations , the hubble expansion rate and the age of the universe .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "we study a cosmological model composed by four fluids : radiation , baryons , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we assume a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) for dark matter ( dm ) and energy ( de ) fluids , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 dm , de , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 corresponds to the density of the fluid and @xmath28 to its pressure .",
    "we are interested in studying the cosmological prediction for the eos of the dark matter , in particular , for the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology .",
    "the friedmann constraint and conservation equations for the radiation , baryonic , dark matter and dark energy fluids are given respectively as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter and the dot over @xmath31 stands for the derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "the conservation equations ( [ consereqradiation])-([consereqdarkmatter ] ) have the respective solutions in terms of the scale factor @xmath32    @xmath33    where the subscript zero at @xmath34 indicates the present - day values of the respective matter - energy densities . inserting the expression ( [ densitiesexpressions ] ) on the friedmann constraint ( [ friedmanneq1st ] ) , and dividing by the hubble constant @xmath35",
    ", it becomes    @xmath36    we define the dimensionless parameter densities as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the critical density evaluated today defined as @xmath39 . with this definition , the friedmann equation ( [ hubbleparameterdensitiesscalefactor ] ) obtains the form    @xmath40    or , using the relation between the scale factor and the redshift `` @xmath41 '' given by @xmath42 , we rewrite the dimensionless eq .",
    "( [ hubbleparameterscalefactor ] ) in terms of the redshift as    @xmath43    setting @xmath44 we have the constraint equation , @xmath45",
    "to constrain the value of @xmath46 using cosmological data , to compute their confidence intervals and to calculate their best estimated values , we use the following cosmological observations described below measuring the expansion history of the universe .    to perform the numerical calculations ,",
    "it was used for the baryonic and radiation ( photons and relativistic neutrinos ) components the values of @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48 respectively , where the later value is computed from the expression @xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the number of standard neutrino species @xcite and @xmath51 corresponds to the present - day photon density parameter for a temperature of @xmath52 k @xcite , where @xmath53 is the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath54 km / s@xmath55mpc ) .",
