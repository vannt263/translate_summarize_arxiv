    "the study of the spatio - temporal organization of vesicles , organelles and other particles inside the cellular medium plays a primary role in the behaviour of cells and constitutes a central problem in physical biology @xcite .    in order to carry out this study",
    ", it is important to consider the fact that the intracellular medium consists of a wide variety of polymers and particles whose presence is the cause of the observed viscolestic behaviour @xcite . as a consequence , during their motion inside the cell the particles may experience elastic , electrochemical and entropic forces that introduce memory effects .",
    "these effects must be taken into account in order to correctly describe the dynamics of the particles .",
    "particles in the intracellular medium undergo different forms of diffusion which depends on the activity of the protein motors and the size of the particles @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion has been observed in the passive transport of particles in the cellular medium @xcite whereas an enhanced diffusion has been reported for particles driven by protein motors @xcite .",
    "a complete description of particle transport must take into account the activity of protein motors @xcite .",
    "these entities are chemo - mechanical transductors which , in the presence of sufficiently high cation concentration , trap particles and then use the free energy arising from the hydrolysis of atp molecules to drive them along defined trajectories inside the cell @xcite giving rise to the enhanced diffusion observed in these systems @xcite .",
    "experiments seem to justify the assumption that the activation as well as the duration of the activity of these protein motors constitutes a random process @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we use mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite to formulate a mesoscopic model that accounts for the enhanced diffusion of particles in the intracellular medium .",
    "we propose a generalized diffusion equation , that incorporates the memory effects due to the viscoelasticity of the intracellular medium and the activity of protein motors , to compute the mean square displacement ( msd ) and to analyze the density of states of the intracellular medium @xcite .",
    "memory effects can be incorporated through _ effective _ mobility and diffusion coefficients that can be memory kernels , @xcite or time - dependent coefficients @xcite . in our approach , the generalized diffusion equation incorporates memory effects through time dependent coefficients .",
    "we choose this way because in the linear force case it is possible to show the equivalence of this description with that given by means of generalized langevin equations with memory kernels @xcite .",
    "this relation between both descriptions is also used in order to calculate the noise density of states arising in the case of enhanced diffusion . however , in this case the stochastic forces are of non - thermal nature due to the activity of protein motors .",

    "it is important to stress that the power law dependence on the frequency of the nds given by ( [ nds ] ) and valid up to the corresponding debye cutoff frequency , is of the form of the generalized debye spectrum proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "the results we have obtained enable us to conclude that the activity of protein motors in the intracellular medium modifies the dependence on frequency of the nds .",
    "for example , in accordance with experiments @xcite the msd of the particles grows by following the power law @xmath114 implying that the exponent of the generalized debye spectrum is @xmath115 , which contrast with the spectrum for subdiffusion which is @xmath116 .",
