    "several cosmological observations at high redshift with supernovae of the type ia @xcite , @xcite show evidence of the current accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "similarly , observations of anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite suggest that the responsible of this acceleration is an entity known as dark energy whose main characteristic is that the equation of state ( eos ) satisfies @xmath0 and is not fulfilled by baryons , radiation ( neutrinos and photons ) neither dark matter and makes up @xmath1 of the total content of the universe @xcite .",
    "currently , different proposals stress as candidates of dark energy the quintessence energy @xcite , cosmological constant @xcite & @xcite , phantom energy @xcite and other several candidates that comes from higher dimensional theories @xcite & @xcite which satisfy the suitable eos for an accelerated expansion or that provides the ability of accelerate the universe by means of topological effects ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to remark that among all these proposals , the cosmological constant is the most accepted candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , the best candidate is _ plagued _ of fundamental problems among which are the fine tuning between the observational results which predict an energy density of @xmath2 in contrast with the theoretical results that predict @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite ( 120 orders of magnitude ) as well as the coincidence problem associated with the recent universe acceleration .",
    "focusing on solve the problems of dark energy nature ; this paper proposes a geometric lower dimensional solution postulating that _ fundamental regions _ permeate the universe in a homogeneous and isotropic distribution .",
    "we consider that each fundamental region is in its minimum energy state related with the heisenberg uncertainty principle as well as the relation of the size of this regions with the schwarzschild radius and the consideration of a relativistic behavior as an extension of the results obtained by several authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "remarkably , the counting of this fundamental regions must be performed only in one preferential direction and not in the three space dimensional directions related with the space - time structure ; suggesting that at high energies , the universe could behave as @xmath4 dimensional manifold as is argued by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that these kind of cosmological models with @xmath4 space - time dimensions , provide an interesting theoretical laboratoryto explore the behavior of classical and quantum gravity @xcite . the same calculation performed in the three dimensions immediately generates a wrong value of the energy density which can be interpreted as the cosmological constant fine tuning problem .",
    "interestingly the previous conditions generates a natural accelerated expansion of the universe when the scale factor corresponds to the matter domination era .",
    "furthermore , the resulting eos evolves like quintessence , cosmological constant and finally as phantom energy ; having the remarkable goal that the energy density behaves as that predicted by the holographic principle @xcite where the information is enclosed in the area of the physical object . finally , using a constriction to reduce the calculations",
    ", we analyze the dynamical system obtained from the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations for this universe with the other components ( dark matter , baryons , photons and neutrinos ) .",
    "we will henceforth use units in which @xmath5 .",
    "_ postulates_. we considered a fundamental geometric regions ( fgr ) with relativistic energy @xmath6 and linear momentum @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor , @xmath9 is the rest mass of the fundamental region and @xmath10 is the velocity associated with the fgr .",
    "it is important to remark that the relativistic treatment generates new dynamics in high energy environments in comparison with a no relativistic treatment .",
    "this new scope is important for the understanding of the fgr and its relation with the elusive dark energy .    in the same way",
    "the position and momentum of the fgr in its minimal state is determined through the heisenberg principle as @xmath11 .    then , the combination of these postulates lead to the following expression @xmath12 , where we have assumed the following association : @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "if the length of the fgr is related with the schwarzschild diameter as @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath16 is the newtonian constant , then the energy and length of these structures can be written as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the planck mass and it is related with the newtonian constant as @xmath19 . if the fgr is immersed in a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of the universe , we can accept that the total energy read as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of fgr in a @xmath22 region of space in concordance with the expectations of the lower dimensions models @xcite , @xcite ( it is possible to demonstrate that if the three dimensions of the space @xmath23 is added , the value of the energy density is not in agreement with the observational result for a demonstration ] ) , @xmath24 the physical radius of the universe ( thus @xmath25 is the physical diameter of the universe ) . using in the total energy as a result of the contributions of each fgr in all the @xmath22 universe is @xmath26 .    on the other hand ,",
    "observations confirm that the universe behave as a @xmath27 dimensional manifold ; then it is necessary project the @xmath4 dimensional results in the @xmath27 dimensional universe .",
    "then , it is possible to expect that the volume can be written as @xmath28 @xcite , this is because flatness implies that the geometry of the hypersurface is euclidean in @xmath29 .",
    "therefore it is possible to define the volume of the universe as the usual of a three sphere @xmath30 .",
    "finally the @xmath22 energy can be projected in the @xmath31 universe with the equation @xmath32 and then the energy density of the fgr can be written as    @xmath33    which coincide with the holographic principle , due that the @xmath34 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath35 under the assumption that the velocity of the fgr its part of the space - time .",
    "the idea behind the cut - off scale can be described with the following words : a minimal information should exist and the consistent density associated to this minimal counterpart should be employed as an energy density .    with the aim of study the dynamics in a cosmological context ,",
    "a useful expression of the last equation can be written in a comoving coordinates @xmath36 , in the following way    @xmath37^{-1/2 } , \\label{rho}\\ ] ]    where the velocity of this regions is associated with the rate of the expansion of the universe as @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath39 can be defined as @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath42 is the distance in a comoving reference system which is the free parameter associated to the theory .    considering a fluid behavior we accept the following equation @xmath43",

    "finally , the eos can be expressed as    @xmath47 , \\label{omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 can be written in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath49 and the scale factor .",
    "it is important to note that in the equation we use the relation @xmath50 .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the eos when the scale factor corresponds to the matter domination era in order to extract information about its evolution .",
    "thus , the scale factor evolves as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the matter density .",
    "then , the equation can be written as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the redshift that it is related to the scale factor as @xmath58 .    following fischler _",
    "@xcite , we assume @xmath59 as the particle horizon used in the holographic cosmology ( li propose the future event horizon @xcite in a no relativistic limit ) , thus @xmath45 can be expressed with the following equation    @xmath60    for matter domination we obtain that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the current age of the universe ( @xmath63 ) , then @xmath64 ( where it is temporarily re - introduced the units ) .    in term of time",
    "@xmath65 , the previous expression tell us the following aspects :    1 .   under those hypothesis ; currently , the eos is @xmath66 which corresponds to quintessence models ( @xmath67 ) @xcite ( see figure [ figure ] ) .",
    "the eos for cosmological constant @xmath68 is at @xmath69 ( see figure [ figure ] ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "3 .   and after this era , the phantom energy ( @xmath70 ) @xcite dominates the scene triggering a big rip at @xmath71 after this moment ; this is because @xmath51 tends to diverge as @xmath72 grows ( see figure [ figure ] ) .",
    "for example caldwell _",
    "argues that the remaining time for the big rip with phantom energy as source of dark energy , is at @xmath73 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this peculiar behavior suggests that the fgr could be considered as _ source of dark energy_.     _ vs _ redshift @xmath74 from the equation .",
    "the eos begins with @xmath75 and diverge when the redshift grows @xmath74 . ]",
    "it is important to stress that the constriction generate that the differentiation of the scale factor must be @xmath76 .",
    "we study the dynamical evolution of the universe which can be described with the einstein field equations @xmath77 where the energy momentum tensor can be written as    @xmath78    being the first term in the equation the corresponding to the matter ( dark matter and baryons ) , radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) and the corresponds to fgr ( we have used the signature @xmath79 ) .    applying the einstein field equations , we obtain the following friedmann and raychaudhuri equations as    @xmath80    @xmath81 , \\label{raych}\\ ] ]    being @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the indication of matter composed by dark matter and baryons @xmath84 , ( @xmath85 ) is the indications of radiation composed by photons and neutrinos @xmath86 ; finally ( @xmath87 ) is for the _ dark energy _ of fgr proposed in the model , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "equivalently the conservation equation for each universe component can be written as    @xmath90    [ eq : back ]    assuming that @xmath91 . the equation ( [ eq : back]e ) is significantly different to the other conservation equations due to the source term in the right hand of the expression .",
    "this source term generates the accelerated expansion expected in the dynamic of the universe .",
    "similarly , this behavior can be observed in the raychaudhuri equation where @xmath92 becomes positive .    in order to solve the system of equations - we define the following dimensionless variables    @xmath93    where it is remarked explicitly all the universe components and it is assumed the following constriction @xmath94 in _ order to simplify the equations for fgr_.    using these variables , the equations for the evolution of the background universe can be transformed into the following equations    @xmath95    [ eq : dsb ]    where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the e - folding number @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is defined as    @xmath98 , \\label{17}\\ ] ]    subject to the friedmann constraint    @xmath99    to solve the dynamical system - it is necessary impose the initial conditions to the @xmath100 taken from @xmath101-years wmap values ( see table [ tablei ] ) and the model prediction for dark energy as @xmath102 .",
    ".wmap 7-year values .",
    "mlrefers to the maximum likelihood parameters @xcite [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the density parameter for photons is @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "equivalently , the density parameter for neutrinos can be written as @xmath105 @xcite-@xcite .        as we observe from the figure ( [ figure3 ] ) the constriction ( @xmath94 ) generates that the evolution of the dark energy is subdominant in early times of the universe allowing nucleosynthesis in radiation ( photons@xmath106neutrinos ) domination era and the structure formation in the matter domination era .",
    "correspondingly , the dark energy ( composed with fgr ) is dominant in later times in universe evolution which fits with the observational results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most notable departure from this model is that the addition of relativistic corrections contributes to extra information of the behavior of this _ dark energy _ model , introducing new dynamics which lack the newtonian limit @xcite , @xcite . to summarizing the results we remark the most important features of this model in the following way :    the eos behave as quintessence , cosmological constant and phantom energy in different epochs of the universe and predicts a big rip in @xmath107 due to the divergence in the eos ( see figure ( [ figure ] ) ) if it is choose a scale factor that corresponds to the matter scale factor in the equation .",
    "it should be noted that the addition of this relativistic correction give us a natural acceleration without the need of future horizon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the supposition of the fgr and the reduction of the dimensions assumed in the lower dimensional models , generates the correct value for the energy density of vacuum and the coincidence problem , giving us new clues about the nature of _ dark energy _ and the accelerated expansion of the universe . doing emphasis that the results are in concordance with the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "additionally , we analyze the friedmann , raychaudhuri and conservation equations through a dynamical system showing that the fgr could be a strong candidate to be the source of dark energy due to that it is dominant in later times of the universe evolution preserving nucleosynthesis and structure formation epoch .",
    "better analysis of the eos can be studied if we not use the constriction @xmath94 to simplify the dimensionless variables . in this study",
    "it is necessary ameliorate the dynamical equations together with the computational environment .",
    "further studies will explore this alternative to dark energy nature to obtain new clues of the behavior and fate of @xmath1 of our universe @xcite & @xcite , principally in the inflation epoch and in the extreme gravitational environments as galactic nuclei and stellar black holes . in a similar vein ,",
    "it is necessary an exhaustive study of the hypothesis that the universe behaves as @xmath4 dimensional space - time at planck scales with the aim of found evidences of this particular behavior together with a most realistic scenario to understand the projection of the @xmath22 to the @xmath31 current universe .",

    "here we demonstrate that the consideration of @xmath23 due to the three dimensional space generate a wrong value known as _ fine tuning problem _ of the density energy of vacuum .",
    "this is because the expression          where @xmath110 , and it is used the election of @xmath111 then @xmath112 .",
