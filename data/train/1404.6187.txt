    "the phenomenon of zitterbewegung ( zb , trembling motion ) was devised by schrodinger in 1930 for free electrons in a vacuum  @xcite .",
    "schrodinger showed that , in the dirac equation , the electron velocity operator does not commute with the hamiltonian , so that the electron velocity is not a constant of the motion also in the absence of external fields . solving differential equation for the time dependence of velocity schrodinger demonstrated that , in addition to the classical motion , the velocity contains a quickly oscillating zitterbewegung component .",
    "for many years zb was a subject of theoretical fascination but also of controversy since many authors questioned its existence or observability .",
    "it was later recognized that zb is due to an interference between positive and negative energy solutions of the dirac equation  @xcite . in an important paper ,",
    "lock  @xcite showed that , if an electron is represented by a wave packet , zb oscillations decay in time as a consequence of the riemann - lebesgue lemma .",
    "since 1970 the phenomenon of zb was proposed for electrons in superconductors and semiconductors in which , due to their energy spectra dominated by two bands separated by a gap , an interference of positive and negative energy states can take place  @xcite . in 1997",
    "zawadzki  @xcite indicated that , because of a close analogy between the behavior of electrons in narrow - gap semiconductors and relativistic electrons in a vacuum , one can expect the trembling motion in narrow - gap semiconducting alloys similar to that proposed by schrodinger in a vacuum , but having much lower frequencies and considerably higher amplitudes",
    ".    in 2005 papers by zawadzki  @xcite and schliemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite triggered a real surge of theoretical works describing zb in various systems , see e.g.  @xcite , and the review  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the present authors demonstrated that the zb phenomenon in a periodic potential can be regarded as a mode in which the electron keeps its total energy constant , compensating the periodic potential changes by periodic changes of the kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "a proof - of - principle simulation of the 1 + 1 dirac equation with the resulting zb of a wave packet was carried out by gerritsma _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with the use of cold ions interacting with laser beams .",
    "however , with all the theoretical progress made in the description of zitterbewegung in solids , there have been no experimental observations of the phenomenon .",
    "there are a few reasons for that . in recent literature",
    "the electrons are generally represented in the form of gaussian wave packets with large initial quasi - momentum  @xmath0 transverse to the proposed direction of zb , see e.g.  @xcite . however , it is not clear how to prepare experimentally electrons in this form and , in particular , how to transfer to an electron a large initial quasi - momentum . in a recent paper",
    ", the present authors indicated that one should take an `` experimental '' approach , i.e. _ not to assume _ anything about the wave packet , but to _ determine it _ from a known form of the experimental laser pulse that triggers the whole zb process  @xcite . secondly , and this is probably the main reason for the non - observation of zb phenomenon in solids , the `` trembling electrons '' move in a crystal with different directions and phases , so that the oscillations may average to zero .",
    "thus , in order to observe the trembling directly , one would need to follow the motion of a single electron .    in order to overcome the above difficulties , we follow example of the bloch oscillator ( bo ) .",
    "the bloch oscillator is another phenomenon which had been proposed a long time ago and it took many years to observe it .",
    "the phenomena of zb and bo are basically similar , their nature is different , but they are both characterized by electron oscillations with an inherent frequency : for bo it is determined by an external electric field and for zb by an energy gap between the conduction and valence bands . in both situations",
    "various electrons oscillate with different phases .",
    "the bloch oscillator was finally investigated and observed by means of nonlinear optics .",
    "von plessen and thomas  @xcite used the third - order perturbation expansion in electric field to calculate a two - photon echo ( 2pe ) signal resulting from bloch oscillations in superlattices . in this scheme the sample",
    "is illuminated by two subsequent laser pulses with the wave vectors  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 at times  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "light is then emitted into the background - free direction  @xmath5 due to the nonlinear optical interaction in the sample  @xcite .",
    "the above method , with some variations , was successfully used to observe the bloch oscillations in gaas / gaalas superlattices , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the essential point that makes the techniques of nonlinear optics so powerful is the condition of phase matching  @xmath6 .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , the individual dipoles created by oscillating electrons are properly phased so that the field emitted by each dipole adds coherently in the  @xmath7 direction , which strongly enhances the emitted signal  @xcite .    following the path taken in above works we turn to the nonlinear optics and , more specifically , to the two - photon echo technique  @xcite .",
    "we show that such an experiment can be used to detect the zb phenomenon in solids . in our approach",
    ", we do not assume anything about the electron wave packet , but determine it from excitation by a laser pulse .",
    "in calculating the medium polarization we do not use perturbation expansions , but compute exact solutions from the time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "we use the density matrix  ( dm ) formalism since we want to include effects of relaxation and decoherence .",
    "both these features affect the interference of positive and negative energy states which underlines the trembling motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we shortly summarize the band structure of cnt and indicate how to introduce light to the formalism . section  iii contains the calculation of zitterbewegung and the resulting medium polarization .",

    "experimental observations of photon echo in cnt were carried out , for example , in ref .",
    "all in all , it seems possible to observe the zb oscillations using the method proposed in the present work .",
    "we hope that the present approach will motivate experiments detecting the phenomenon of electron trembling motion in solids .",
    "it is important to find proper material and pulse parameters allowing for an observation of zb oscillations .",
    "first , the spectrum of both laser pulses should contain frequencies corresponding to interband frequencies between at least one pair of energy subbands .",
    "next , the central laser frequency  @xmath64 should be close , but not equal to the selected interband frequency .",
    "further , too wide spectra of the pulses result in an excitation of electron motion with many interband frequencies which makes it difficult to observe and interpret the 2pe signal  @xcite .",
    "the above requirements are fulfilled for light pulses having the width of a few cycles .",
    "finally , the zb oscillations of electron position must exist after pulse termination , see fig .",
    "the material and pulse parameters listed in table  1 fulfill all above conditions .",
    "it is to be noted that for pulses obtained using a ti : sapphire laser tuned to  @xmath190  fs@xmath61 , the last condition seems to be not met .    in this work",
    "we apply a non - perturbative calculation of the two - photon echo signal with the use of the vector - potential gauge .",
    "we obtain the total polarization  @xmath126 via the average velocity , see eqs .",
    "( [ liou_vkxmy ] )   ( [ liou_p ] ) . in standard procedures employed in nonlinear optics ,",
    "the electric - field gauge is used which automatically ensures the gauge invariance of the results  @xcite . in or approach",
    "we apply the vector - potential gauge because then the wave - vector  @xmath38 in the hamiltonian  ( [ cnt_hht ] ) is a good quantum number and equations  ( [ liou_rho11 ] ) ",
    "( [ liou_imrho21 ] ) are ordinary differential equations . in the electric - field gauge",
    "the corresponding equations would be partial differential equations , more difficult to solve .",
    "still , the use of the vector potential gives correct results for the following reasons .",
    "first , the liouville equation ( [ liou_h ] ) without the damping term is gauge - invariant .",
    "second , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the phenomenological damping term  @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ liou_h ] ) is gauge - invariant in the dipole approximation , if the characteristic length of the problem is much smaller that the light wavelength . in our system",
    "this condition is satisfied because the laser wavelength is much larger than the cnt radius , see  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation expansion within the vector - potential gauge may be incorrect if one truncates the expansion at a finite order terms  @xcite . in our case",
    "the numerical calculation of the polarization  @xmath159 ensures that the vector potential is taken into account in _ all _ orders of the perturbation series , so that the gauge invariance is preserved .",
    "the nonlinear polarization  @xmath154 is extracted from  @xmath159 in the non - perturbative way using the rwa  @xcite , so that it is also gauge - invariant .",
    "this is also true for  @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the use of vector - potential gauge requires an application of the non - perturbative way to calculate the polarization  @xmath154 . on the other hand",
    ", the calculation of the third - order polarization  @xmath191 , carried out in quantum chemistry  @xcite , has to be performed in the electric - field gauge , since the perturbation series is truncated .    in our description",
    "we use the density matrix formalism .",
    "the dm approach allows one to take into account dephasing processes . since we consider two laser shots separated by the delay  @xmath166 , the decoherence time  @xmath150  fs may not be neglected , especially for large  @xmath166 .",
    "the time integration in eq .",
    "( [ 2pe_s ] ) extends to large temporal values and the presence of damping ensures its convergence . in the absence of damping the polarization  @xmath192 in eq .",
    "( [ 2pe_s ] ) decays as  @xmath193 with  @xmath194 , which may lead to problems with the convergence of integrals for large times . in the presence of dephasing",
    "processes the integrand vanishes exponentially  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the absence of relaxation processes , the electron remains forever in the state with small admixture of positive energy states while , in the presence of damping , it relaxes to the ground state with the characteristic time  @xmath195  fs , which makes the description more realistic .",
    "the 2pe signal is obtained from the total polarization  @xmath126 induced by the laser shots which , in this work , is calculated within the dm formalism . in principle",
    ", however ,  @xmath126 can be obtained using simpler methods , e.g. by solving the schrodinger equation with the time - dependent hamiltonian  @xcite , in which damping effects are neglected . as a matter of example , the results indicated by the dotted line in fig .  3 ,",
    "correspond to the damping - free case , as obtained using the wave - function approach with the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ cnt_hht ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the damping - free results have the same period and phase as those calculated for finite damping times .",
    "on the other hand , the total polarization can be obtained appying more sophisticated methods like the cnt bloch equations  @xcite .",
    "the cnt bloch equations allow one to obtain  @xmath126 taking into account the existence of excitons and many - body effects like a renormalization of subbands energies .",
    "but the presence of excitons and many - body effects weakly alters the energy gap of cnt , so that the resulting polarization would oscillate with a frequency close to that shown in figs .  3 and  4 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , von plessen and thomas  @xcite used similar approach to calculate the two - photon signal for coherently exited bloch oscillations in superlattices . in their work ,",
    "the 2pe was calculated using perturbation expansion of the time - dependent electron wave function .",
    "the signal was computed within the third order of the incident field and it exhibited oscillations with the period equal to that of the bloch oscillations . in our approach",
    "we propose a similar method but we apply different formalism for the reasons given above .",
    "the degenerate four wave mixing ( dfwm ) technique was successfully applied for experimental observation of bloch oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this method would be also applicable for an observation of zb oscillations .",
    "in dfwm one uses three laser pulses having two different frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the theory of dfwm in a non - perturbative approach was described in ref .",
    "the spectroscopic signal may be calculated from twelve combinations of laser beam phases by formulas analogous to those in eq .",
    "( [ 2pe_nl ] ) , which requires a considerably larger numerical effort than that for 2pe , as presented here .",
    "the method of dfwm seems to be less practical for our system since it requires three laser pulses instead of two .",
    "but if this complication is of minor importance , dfwm might be also applied to observations of zb .    in the present work we concentrate on zigzag nanotubes since for such cnts",
    "the subbands minima and maxima occur at  @xmath196 .",
    "this feature simplifies the model and the calculations but it is not decisive for the existence of zb . in our considerations we chose the semiconductor",
    "zigzag cnt with  @xmath58 .",
    "however , the results similar to those shown in fig .  3 can be obtained for other  @xmath197 values as well as for other cnt types : arm - chair and chiral ones  @xcite .",
    "the zb oscillations should be observable by 2pe experiments also in super - lattices .",
    "the crucial point is to adjust the laser central frequency  @xmath64 to the energy gap of the material .",
    "the results shown in fig",
    ".  3 require a fairly large computational effort , which is the main disadvantage of the non - perturbative calculation of 2pe signals .",
    "however , there are several practical advantages of this approach .",
    "first , once the numerical procedures are tested and implemented , they can be equally well applied to low and high electric fields , as well as to overlapping or non - overlapping pulses of arbitrary length .",
    "another advantage is that similar calculations can be repeated for different configurations of phases , mesh points etc .",
    "but the most important point is that the non - perturbative procedure ensures gauge - invariant results within the vector - potential gauge .",
    "we considered the electron zitterbewegung in zigzag carbon nanotubes excited by laser light .",
    "the band structure of cnt was described within the tight binding approach and the light was introduced to the electron hamiltonian by the vector potential in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "in contrast to common treatments , we did not make any assumptions concerning the electron wave packet , but determined it as a result of illumination by light . trying to solve the problem created by the fact that the trembling electrons move in various directions and their zb oscillations have various phases",
    ", we considered a two - photon echo method successfully used to detect the bloch oscillator phenomenon .",
    "the medium polarization of cnt was calculated in the density function formalism by finding numerical solutions of the time - dependent hamiltonian for electrons in cnt .",
    "the two - photon echo signal was then extracted from the total medium polarization and it was shown that it is possible to perform the two - photon echo experiment with the existing cnt parameters and laser pulse characteristics . such an experiment should unambiguously detect the phenomenon of zitterbewegung in solids .",
