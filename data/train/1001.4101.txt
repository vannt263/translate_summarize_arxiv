    "the chaplygin gas model represents the best known proposal of a unification of dm and de into a single fluid @xcite . in its generalized form @xcite ,",
    "the chaplygin gas is a fluid with an equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath5 is the energy density . solving the conservation equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scale factor of the spatially flat robertson - walker metric , the result for the energy density is @xmath8^{1/\\left(1+\\alpha\\right)}\\ .",
    "\\label{rho}\\ ] ] the present value of the scale factor is normalized to @xmath9 .",
    "combined with friedmann s equation and assuming @xmath10 , the solution ( [ rho ] ) interpolates between a matter phase for @xmath11 and a de sitter phase for @xmath12 . in this sense",
    ", the gcg can play the roles of dark matter in the past and of dark energy at present and future times , thus unifying the two components of the dark sector of the cosmic substratum into a single component .",
    "the original chaplygin gas corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "it can be traced back to the nambu - goto action in the light cone parametrization @xcite , that is , it can be seen as rooted in a string theoretical context .",
    "the generalization to @xmath14 is phenomenological @xcite .",
    "however , the gcg model has the advantage of providing an interpolation between the @xmath15cdm model , represented by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and other models , like , e.g. , viscous models @xcite .",
    "similar approaches are the so - called cardassian models @xcite .",
    "thus , the gcg model covers a large variety of dark energy models .",
    "a great deal of effort has been made in order to constrain the different parameters of the gcg model , mainly the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this includes data from supernova type ia @xcite , the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite and the matter power spectrum ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "constraints from combined data sources have been obtained in @xcite and @xcite .    the supernova type ia data were shown to be well described by the gcg gas , which seems to be favorable for the unified model .",
    "but the situation changes if the model is confronted with matter power spectrum data . in this brief communication",
    "we generalize our previous newtonian analysis @xcite of the 2dfgrs program @xcite to the fully relativistic case .",
    "we consider three configurations of a chaplygin - gas cosmology .",
    "\\(i ) at first we assume the material content of the universe to consist of a gcg , radiation and a pressureless baryon component with a fraction of @xmath18 , as suggested by the five - year wmap data .",
    "in other words , we prescribe a unified model of the dark sector .",
    "the result is that , together with very small values of @xmath1 , for which the gcg behavior is close to that of a cosmological constant , also values @xmath19 have a high probability .",
    "this confirms both an earlier qualitative but gauge invariant analysis of matter power spectrum data @xcite and our previous simplified newtonian analysis @xcite .",
    "still more surprising is that very large values , i.e. values of several hundreds for @xmath1 , are preferred by the data .",
    "this confirms an independent investigation of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect with preferred values up to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) at second we consider the original chaplygin gas , i.e. , the case @xmath13 , but we leave the matter fraction free , thus admitting that the matter component is not just made up by the baryons .",
    "this is equivalent to allow for a separate dm component in addition to the gcg .",
    "for this reason we write the fractional density parameter for the pressureless matter today as @xmath21 .",
    "this additional freedom is used to test the unified model of the dark sector .",
    "the unified model can be regarded as favored by the data if the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the matter fraction is large around the value that characterizes the baryon fraction . if , on the other hand , the pdf is largest at a substantially higher value , the unified model has to be regarded as disfavored .",
    "our fully relativistic study confirms the results of a previous newtonian analysis according to which the matter fraction does not only not peak around the value for baryons , but it is maximal at values of @xmath22 close to @xmath23 . in other words ,",
    "the data seem to prefer a model which is close to the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "this contradicts the results from the sn ia data according to which the unification scenario , i.e , a universe filled almost exclusively by the chaplygin gas component , is favored @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) at third we extend the analysis of ( ii ) to @xmath24 .",
    "as far as the value of @xmath22 is concerned , we recover the result of ( ii ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath1 is similar to that described under ( i ) , although here it is less important since the gcg is subdominant .    strictly speaking , models with @xmath25 seem to be un - physical since they correspond to a superluminal sound speed .",
    "however , with certain modification causality can be preserved @xcite . to see the influence of a large @xmath1 on the background dynamics of a gcg cosmology",
    ", we consider the eos parameter @xmath26 the parameter @xmath1 influences the value of @xmath7 at which the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion occurs . assuming a unified model and denoting the transition value of the scale factor by @xmath27 , one has @xmath28 solving for @xmath27 yields @xmath29 since @xmath30 this means , that for growing values of @xmath1 the transition period @xmath27 approaches @xmath31 , i.e. , the present epoch .",
    "for very large @xmath1 , the matter period is longer and the transition to accelerated expansion occurs suddenly and more recently than in the @xmath15cdm model .",
    "this property has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "our starting point are einstein s equations coupled to a pressureless fluid , radiation and to the gcg .",

    "this feature is both in agreement with a previous gauge - invariant perturbation analysis @xcite and with our simplified newtonian model @xcite .",

    "according to our criterion , the unified model is clearly disfavored , since the gcg fraction is of the order of @xmath73 .    in case ( iii )",
    "all the three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath64 are left free .",
    "the two - dimensional pdfs for all binary combinations are shown in figure [ pdf2 ] , the one - dimensional pdfs in figure [ pdf1 ] .",

    "the behavior of @xmath1 is similar to that of the unified model of case ( i ) , although this result is less important here since the gcg is subdominant .",
    "we remark that a more detailed , quantitative estimation for the parameters of the model is doubtful due to the existence of different regions of high probability implying that the one - dimensional pdf is not gaussian .",
    "our fully relativistic analysis corroborates the results that were previously obtained within a simplified newtonian analysis @xcite . as in the newtonian case ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath64 is sensitive to the number of free parameters considered . for @xmath1",
    "there are two regions of high probability : one region near zero and a second one for @xmath74 .",
    "although the existence of this second region comes as a surprise and represents a new result compared with @xcite , it confirms an entirely independent investigation , using the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath22 is essentially the same as in the newtonian case : a universe with negligible chaplygin gas component is favored .",
    "in fact , our analysis of the large - scale structure data from the 2dfgrs , taken separately , does not favor an accelerating universe .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the results for the homogeneous and isotropic background on the basis of the supernova data @xcite .",
    "this may imply that the chaplygin gas model should be discarded .",
    "but on the other hand it is well known ( see also @xcite ) , that the matter power spectrum generally does not sufficiently constrain the dark energy component .",
