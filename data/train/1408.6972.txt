    "for future semiconductor technologies the incorporation , profiling and monitoring of dopants is considered to be a key issue for novel device applications @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of a dopant is an important characteristic , and recent studies have focused on the investigation of the binding energies of single hydrogenic defect states close to semiconductor surfaces , in nanoscale devices , or in quantum wells @xcite . for a shallow coulombic hydrogenic impurity state in the effective mass approximation , the binding energy of the state is predicted to decrease when approaching a potential barrier at a semiconductor interface or surface @xcite .",
    "a model proposed by levine@xcite showed that at a semiconductor surface the ground state of a shallow impurity is the 2p state , which means that the binding energy of the surface donor is 1/4 of the bulk donor .",
    "however , image charges at the surface cause the binding energy to be closer to its bulk value , while still being reduced @xcite . in contrast , recent theoretical studies found an _ increase _ of the hydrogenic impurity binding energies in nanowires and quantum dots due to dielectric confinement @xcite .",
    "additionally , an experimental investigation of si doped gaas estimated an increasing binding energy at depths @xmath2  nm @xcite , and the authors concluded that the effective mass approach will fail for all hydrogenic donors close to a semiconductor surface .",
    "the descibed effects so far occur on a length scale of typically less than ten nanometers . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the change of the binding energy of single shallow hydrogen - like donor states on a much larger length scale at depths between 10  nm and @xmath3  200  nm , where the effective mass approximation appears to be appropriate , and dielectric confinement and position dependent effective masses or dielectric constants are negligible . even in the case of band bending at the surface  which is of particular importance for this work ",
    "the effective mass approximation is expected to hold because the fractional change of the perturbation potential over the dimension of a unit cell is negligibly small@xcite ( less than 1% in our case ) . in case of good sample quality with dislocation line densities",
    "@xmath4/@xmath5 the effect of internal strain , due to these dislocations , on the ionization energy of shallow donor states can be neglected @xcite .",
    "however , the donor ionization energy may be affected by the presence of electric fields close to the sample surface : in a lowly doped semiconductor , surface states can cause a pinning of the fermi level at the surface which results in a band bending on a length scale given by the debye length @xcite . in this case",
    "the solution of the poisson equation yields an quadratic @xmath6 dependence of the electrostatic potential in the band bending zone close to the surface @xcite , which means a linearly increasing electric field towards the surface .",
    "the presence of an electric field lowers the ionization energy of the shallow impurity ( poole - frenkel effect in insulators or semiconductors@xcite ) , and  since the electric field increases on approaching the surface  the binding energy is expected to decrease when getting closer to the surface .",
    "hydrogen as an ubiquitous impurity is of particular interest in semiconductor technology , because it often modifies the electrical and optical properties in an unwanted way due to its amphoteric behaviour , which may cause doping counteracting the prevailing type of conductivity .",
    "the characterization of hydrogen impurities in semiconductors is often difficult , particularly if one wants to study single ( or solitary ) dopants . here ,",
    "positively charged muons ( @xmath7 ) can help to circumvent these difficulties .",
    "muons played an important role in the identification and characterization of isolated hydrogen defect centers in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "implanted in a semiconductor or insulator the @xmath7 stops at an interstitial site , and may capture one or two electrons to form the light hydrogen pseudo - isotope muonium [ mu , ( @xmath8 ) , mass of @xmath9 proton masses ] .",
    "depending on the concentration of other dopants , and on mu formation energy , it occurs in either of three charge states mu@xmath10 , mu@xmath11 or mu@xmath12 , analogous to hydrogen .",
    "the neutral state can be spectroscopically distinguished from the charged states in muon spin rotation experiments ( @xmath0sr ) @xcite . the recent theoretical discovery of a universal alignment of the so - called hydrogen pinning level @xmath13(+/- )  where the formation energies of the positive and negative impurity are equal  allows predictions whether hydrogen forms a shallow donor : this occurs if the pinning level is close to or above the conduction band minimum @xcite .",
    "the predicted shallow hydrogen donor states in zno @xcite and inn @xcite have been first confirmed by @xmath0sr measurements @xcite , closely followed in zno by epr @xcite and infrared spectroscopy @xcite . in cds",
    "the observed shallow mu state @xcite does not necessarily imply , according to the theoretical models , that in thermodynamic equilibrium hydrogen acts as a shallow donor .",
    "since the muon experiments take place on a microsecond time scale ( muon life time is @xmath3  2.2  @xmath0s ) , the observed shallow mu state could be a metastable state @xcite .        in this article we present the depth dependence of the ionization energy of the shallow mu state in cds and of the shallow donor state in zno , and at the interface of a 20-nm - thin au film sputtered on zno .",
    "this allows us to obtain direct information about the effect of electric fields  due to band bending  on the ionization energies of the corresponding hydrogen - like states in a range of @xmath3  200  nm beneath the surface , or at a metal - semiconductor interface .",
    "the ionization energies continuously decrease on approaching the surface / interface , reaching a reduction of 25  30  mev at a depth of 10  nm .",
    "we use the observed `` ionization profile '' to determine by a simple one - dimensional model the electric field profile at the surface / interface .",
    "this is to best of our knowledge the first time , that the `` ionization profile '' of a single impurity and the derived electric field profile has been visualized by means of a _ local probe _ implantation technique .",
    "it offers several advantages compared to conventional experimental techniques .",
    "photo - emission spectroscopy and other surface sensitive techniques ( see the review of koenraad and flatt  @xcite and references therein ) are limited to a few surface layers , and can not access interfaces at a depth of tens of nanometers .",
    "deep - level transient spectroscopy is not applicable to low - doped materials , shallow impurity states , and single dopants , and usually requires a p - n junction .",
    "in contrast , there are no such limitations for muon spin rotation , which is contactless , and provides intrinsic information , about shallow as well as deep hydrogen states .",
    "they are incorporated as solitary dopants , and their properties can be monitored as a function of distance to the surface or an interface , thus providing a new experimental tool to address the issues raised at the beginning of this introduction .",
    "the @xmath0sr experiments were carried out at the swiss muon source ( s@xmath0s , paul scherrer institut , villigen , switzerland ) . for the near - surface measurements at mean depths",
    "@xmath14  nm we used the low - energy @xmath0sr spectrometer ( le-@xmath0sr ) lem at the @xmath0e4 beam line @xcite .",
    "polarized low - energy @xmath7 with energies in the kev range are generated by moderation of a 4 mev muon beam in a solid , about 250-nm - thin ar film with a @xmath15-nm - thin n@xmath16 capping layer , deposited at 10  k on a patterned ag foil @xcite .",
    "epithermal muons with a mean energy of @xmath17  ev escape into vacuum with a conversion efficiency from mev - to - ev of @xmath18 .",
    "they are accelerated electrostatically to energies up to 20  kev by applying a positive bias to the ag moderator foil , and then transported by use of electrostatic elements over a distance of about two meters to the sample cryostat .",
    "the muon implantation energy was varied between 2.5 kev and 30 kev , corresponding to mean implantation depths of 10 nm and 150 nm , respectively , see fig .  [ muonstoppingprofile ] .",
    "the implantation energy is usually varied by applying a positive or negative bias of up to 12  kv to the electrically insulated sample holder @xcite .",
    "shallow mu formation deep in the bulk at @xmath19  @xmath0 m was studied at the gps spectrometer at the @xmath20m3 beam line with a muon beam energy of about 3.5  mev .",
    "the samples were nominally undoped zno and cds wafers [ ( 0001 ) orientation , supplier : crystec gmbh , berlin , germany ; resistivity @xmath21  @xmath22 cm and @xmath23 k@xmath22 cm , respectively ] .",
    "the zno crystals had a size of @xmath24  mm@xmath25 and a thickness of 0.5 mm .",
    "nine pieces were glued with conductive silver onto a standard sample plate of lem .",
    "this mosaic of samples ensured that no muons missed the sample , therefore eliminating any background contribution ( the low - energy muon beam spot has a fwhm of about 13 mm ) . in a 2nd experiment several pieces of the zno crystals were sputtered with a 20-nm - thin au film to study any changes introduced by the schottky barrier at the au / zno interface .",
    "the cds sample was one half of a 2  wafer , 0.5 mm thick which was also large enough to stop all muons in the sample .",
    "all samples were polished on both sides . for the gps measurements one of the zno crystals was used , and a @xmath26  mm@xmath25 broken - off piece of the cds wafer .",
    "transverse field @xmath0sr measurements have been performed with a magnetic field of 10 mt applied parallel to the @xmath27 direction , and the muon spin initially parallel to the sample surface at lem , and out of plane at gps .",
    "shallow mu in cds and zno has an anistropic , axially symmetric hyperfine interaction with the hyperfine coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 parallel and perpendicular to the symmetry axis , which is along the cd - s or the zn - o bond direction@xcite . in the high field limit",
    "two shallow mu lines can be observed with a separation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angle between the mu symmetry axis and the externally applied field .",
    "the two lines are placed symmetrically around the `` central '' line , i.e. the precession frequency of bare @xmath7 without bound electron . in the geometry of the experiment",
    "there is one shallow mu state at a bond parallel to the @xmath27 direction ( @xmath32 ) , and three mu states at the bonds under @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath27 axis .",
    "this leads to two pairs of mu lines with an intensity ratio of 1:3 . for zno and",
    "cds the hyperfine couplings are @xmath34  khz and @xmath35  khz , @xmath36  khz and @xmath37  khz , respectively@xcite .",
    "however , only in cds the mu lines are narrow and well resolved in bulk @xmath0sr experiments whereas in zno , spin- and/or charge - exchange with impurities or free charge carriers even at low temperatures ( 5k ) lead to a sizeable broadening of the mu lines which smeares out the mu satellite lines @xcite . in cds , the spitting of the inner lines ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath38  mhz , and the splitting of the outer lines ( @xmath39 ) is @xmath40  mhz . in zno ,",

    "we can rewrite in terms of ionized ( @xmath49 ) and unionized ( @xmath50 ) muonium fractions @xcite : @xmath51 . with this",
    "it follows for the neutral mu@xmath11 fraction @xmath52 @xmath53 = \\frac{1}{1+n\\cdot \\exp(-{e_i}/k_bt)}.\\ ] ] thus , by measuring the neutral mu fraction @xmath52 as a function of temperature the donor ionization energy @xmath1 can be determined .",
    "in case of well resolved satellite lines the @xmath0sr asymmetry spectra can be fit by a sum of five lorentzians ( i.e. exponential relaxation in time domain ) , with the sum @xmath54 of asymmetries ( amplitudes ) of the four mu satellite lines , and the asymmetry @xmath55 of the so - called diamagnetic signal , i.e. a @xmath7 without bound electron .",

    "the analysis has been done in the following way . in practice , it is difficult to derive the temperature dependence of the neutral fraction by trying to fit five lines to the experimental data over the whole temperature range .",
    "problems arise in this procedure in the case of poorly resolved satellites or small mu fractions . also , with increasing temperature spin - exchange processes due to thermally activated charge carriers lead to broadening of the mu satellites and a phase shift of the mu signal with respect to the @xmath7 signal @xcite .",
    "this makes fits in the ionization regime more difficult : whereas at temperatures @xmath57  15  k the cds and zno data could be fit with five lines , where we fixed the splitting of the mu lines to the known values , this procedure did nt work well in the ionization regime .",
    "therefore , we simplified the analysis by an approximation : in cds the @xmath0sr asymmetry spectra @xmath58 were fit over the whole temperature range by the sum of two exponentially decaying components : @xmath59\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the relaxation rate of the central , diamagnetic line which we fixed to the high temperature value ( where mu is ionized , @xmath61  @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 is the @xmath7 precession frequency in the applied magnetic field @xmath64  mt and @xmath65  mhz / t is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon , and @xmath66 is a detectors phase of the corresponding decay positron detector . in this way",

    "for example , the electron emission rate is diminshed in positive @xmath6 direction in the situation skeched in fig .",
    "[ figpotential ] . on the other hand the electron emission rate",
    "is increased by phonon - assisted tunneling , and pure quantum mechanical tunneling . for deep levels",
    "pure tunneling becomes important only at very high fields ( @xmath97 v / cm ) , and a significant emission rate enhancement occurs only for fields @xmath98 v / cm @xcite , which are much larger than the electric fields in our experiment .",
    "in summary we have shown by means of low - energy @xmath0sr that the ionization energy of single shallow hydrogen - like muonium states in cds , zno , and au / zno decreases on approaching the semiconductor surface or interface . compared to the value measured deep in the bulk at @xmath99  @xmath0 m the ionization energy is diminshed by @xmath15  mev at mean depths of 100  150  nm , and further reduced by up to 25  30  mev at a depth of 10  nm .",
    "this reduction is attributed to the presence of electric fields ( poole - frenkel effect ) near the surface / interface due to band bending .",
    "other mechanisms potentially able to cause a change of the ionization energy ( modifications of the wave function , position dependent effective masses and dielectric constants , dielectric confinement ) can be excluded in the investigated depth range . using a simple one - dimensional model allowed to determine the near - surface / interface electric field profile inside the sample .",
    "this kind of investigation recently revealed the presence of a shallow hydrogen donor state in srtio@xmath100 with decreasing ionization energy at the surface @xcite .",
    "it can be extended to semiconductors or semiconductor heterostructures with not too high doping levels ( @xmath93  @xmath87 ) and defect concentrations ( @xmath101  @xmath87 ) .",
