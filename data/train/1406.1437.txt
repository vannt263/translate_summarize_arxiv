    "longmore  4 ( lo  4 ; pn  g274.3 + 09.1 ) is a low - surface - brightness planetary nebula ( pn ) , discovered by longmore ( 1977 ) during the eso - src southern - hemisphere sky survey .",
    "spectroscopic observations of its @xmath1 central star by mndez et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) led to a spectral classification as a pg  1159 star .",
    "pg  1159-type objects ( the name refers to the prototypical star pg  1159@xmath2035 ) are extremely hot , hydrogen - deficient planetary - nebula nuclei ( pnni ) and white dwarfs , having spectra with a conspicuous and absorption trough at 46594686   , and no features due to hydrogen ( apart from a rare class of `` hybrid pg  1159 '' stars showing traces of h ) .",
    "the high - excitation 3811 - 3834    doublet is often seen in emission in the spectra of these stars , and if so they are sometimes referred to as having `` ' ' -type spectra , or early  wc types .",
    "werner , rauch , & kruk ( 2007 ) found atmospheric parameters for the lo  4 central star of @xmath3  k , @xmath4 .",
    "this result , based on the detection of absorption lines in _ fuse _ fuv spectra , was a substantial upward revision in the temperature compared to an earlier analysis that had given @xmath5  k , @xmath6 ( rauch & werner 1997 ) .",
    "the spectrum of lo  4 is quite similar to that of k  1 - 16 , the first known pulsating pnn ( grauer & bond 1984 ) , and a member of the gw  vir class of non - radially pulsating white dwarfs ( reviewed in recent years by fontaine & brassard 2008 , quirion 2009 , and althaus et al .",
    "this close similarity was borne out by the discovery of photometric pulsations in lo  4 by bond & meakes ( 1990 ) .",
    "lo  4 was , at the time , only the second known pulsating pnn , having a strong periodicity near 31  min ( 1850  s ) , along with at least 8 other pulsation modes ranging from 831 to 2325  s. based on its light variations , the central star has been given the variable - star designation lv  velorum , but in this paper i will refer to the star as lo  4 .",
    "a remarkable transient mass - loss event that occurred in lo  4 in 1992 was discovered serendipitously by werner et  al .",
    "( 1992 , 1993 ) . for several days the spectrum changed from pg  1159 to a low - luminosity early carbon wolf - rayet , or [ wce ] , type of about [ wc2 - 3 ] . during this event , the spectrum of lo  4 had strong emission at the complex near 4659   , at 4686   , and at 5291   . within a few days , the star reverted back to its usual pg  1159 spectrum , with the and features once more in absorption .",
    "the mass - loss rate during this outburst was estimated at @xmath7 by werner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . as emphasized by werner et al .",
    ", this dramatic and rapid change in spectral properties was a unique phenomenon , never before seen in any hot post - agb star .",
    "at the time of the 1992 mass - loss episode , only a few spectra had ever been taken of lo  4 .",
    "this suggested that the outbursts are likely not rare events , in lo  4 itself , and possibly in other pg  1159-type pnni .    in order to explore this possibility",
    ", i began a program of regular spectroscopic monitoring of lo  4 in early 2003 , and continued it until early 2012 .",
    "i used the 1.5-m telescope operated by the smarts consortium , located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",
    "the 1.5-m telescope was equipped with a spectrograph at the rc focus and a ccd camera .",
    "data were obtained in queue - scheduling mode by chilean observers .",
    "i used the 26/i grating setup , giving a wavelength coverage of 36505400   , with a resolution of 4.3   .",
    "exposure times were @xmath8  s , yielding a s / n per resolution element of @xmath03040 on good nights .",
    "the ccd images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , combined for cosmic - ray removal , and then the spectra were extracted and wavelength - calibrated , all using standard iraf routines .",
    "data were obtained at essentially randomly chosen dates .",
    "i have given progress reports at two conferences ( bond 2008 , 2010 ) ; the monitoring has now been discontinued and i present the final results here . between 2003 february and 2012 february , 81 usable spectra of lo  4 were obtained .",
    "table  1 lists the dates of the observations .",
    "four new mass - loss events were detected during this interval .",
    "table  2 summarizes the dates of these spectroscopic outbursts .",
    "1 illustrates , as an example , the mass - loss episode that occurred on 2008 november  30 .",
    "the spectra have been normalized to a flat continuum , and a 3-point boxcar smoothing has been applied . the top spectrum , 19  days before the event , is noisy but shows the normal state of lo  4 . on november  30",
    "the doublet at 3811 - 3834    had strengthened over its normal value , and the 5291    emission line was much stronger than usual .",
    "most dramatic was the appearance in strong emission of the + feature at 46594686   , which is normally seen in absorption .",
    "this spectrum is very similar to the outburst spectrum detected by werner et al .  in 1992 .",
    "an observation two days later , obtained on 2008 december  2 ( not included in fig .  1 because poor observing conditions made it very noisy ) , showed that the + emission was already gone . a better spectrum from december  4 , shown at the bottom of fig .  1 , verifies the absence of + emission , as well as the near - disappearance of the 5291    emission line .",
    "i created a high - s / n spectrum of lo  4 in its low state by averaging the 58 best spectra obtained between 2003 and 2012 .",
    "this spectrum is shown at the top of fig .",
    "2 , with the most prominent features of , , and marked .",
    "the next four spectra in the figure show the appearance during the four detected `` high '' states of greatly enhanced mass loss .",
    "the time intervals between these episodes and the previous and following observations showing normal low - state spectra were as follows : ( 1 )  2006 jan .  16 : spectra 53 days earlier and 15 days later were normal ; ( 2 )  2006 nov .  30 : 56 days earlier , 17 days later ; ( 3 )  2008 nov .  30 : 19 days earlier , 2 days later ; ( 4 )  2011 oct .  30 : 164 days earlier , 21 days later .",
    "thus , although the constraints are not tight , the events are likely of relatively short duration , no more than a few to several days , in agreement with the findings reported by werner et al .",
    "the nucleus of the pn ngc  246 is another pg  1159-type star , considerably brighter than lo  4 ( bond & ciardullo 1999 measured @xmath9 ) .",
    "its parameters are similar within the errors to those of lo  4 ; in the same paper in which they discussed _ fuse _ observations of lo  4 , werner et al .  ( 2007 ) reported @xmath10  k , @xmath11 for ngc  246 .",
    "a further indication of the similarity of the two stars arises from the detection of gw  vir - type non - radial pulsations in ngc  246 ( ciardullo & bond 1996 ; gonzlez prez , solheim , & kamben 2006 ) , with periods of @xmath02431  min .",
    "does ngc  246 also have occasional episodes of enhanced mass loss ? to explore this possibility , i obtained spectra with the smarts 1.5-m telescope for this star on 167 occasions , between 2003 june and 2011 july .",
    "in addition to the 26/i grating setup described above , the brightness of ngc  246 made it possible to use two higher - resolution setups : 56/ii ( 40174938   , 2.2    resolution ) and 47/iib ( 40704744   , 1.6    resolution ) .",
    "typical exposure times were @xmath12  s for 26/i and @xmath13  s for 56/ii and 47/iib . in spite of the similar spectra , stellar parameters , and pulsational properties of the two stars , ngc  246 never showed mass - loss events like those of lo  4 during the observations between 2003 and 2011 .",
    "i will provide the observation dates to any interested readers .",
    "i created a high - s / n spectrum for ngc  246 by averaging 21 excellent spectra .",
    "3 compares this spectrum with the average low - state spectrum of lo  4 , and illustrates the similarity .",
    "however , the emission features are noticeably weaker in ngc  246 .",
    "i detected four mass - loss episodes during 81 observations of lo  4 . following the precepts used by zwicky ( 1938 ) to determine the average rate of supernova explosions per galaxy",
    ", i can estimate the typical time between outbursts of lo  4 ( on the assumption that the recurrence rate has been approximately constant over the observing interval ) .",
    "using zwicky s terminology , the `` control value '' of a single observation is the length of time during which an outburst would have been detectable ( i.e. , the duration of a typical mass - loss episode ) .",
    "based on werner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as well as my own results , the control value for lo  4 is about @xmath14  days .",
    "thus the total control value of the 81 observations is @xmath15 ( neglecting the small number of observations separated by less than @xmath16  days ) .",
    "since 4 outbursts were detected , the mean rate of mass - loss events in lo  4 is found to be about one every @xmath17 ( with a statistical uncertainty of about @xmath1850% since only 4 events were detected ) .",
    "moreover , we can estimate that the mean fraction of the total elapsed time during which lo  4 was in outburst is about @xmath19 \\simeq 5\\%$ ] , independent of the outburst duration as long as it is short compared to the typical spacing of the observations .    at present",
    "there seems to be no entirely satisfactory explanation for these transient mass - loss episodes in lo  4 .",
    "one constraint is that the temporary stellar wind is _ hydrogen - deficient _ and _ helium - rich _ , and thus must arise from photospheric material .",
    "this shows that the outbursts are unlikely to be related to accretion events involving a companion star , debris disk , infalling planet , or other exotic external cause .",
    "no 24  @xmath20 m dust excess in lo  4 was found in a _",
    "survey by chu et al .",
    "the short durations of the episodes indicate that they are not driven on an evolutionary timescale .",
    "lo  4 lies in the hr diagram for hot post - agb remnants near the boundary between emission - line [ wce ] and predominantly absorption - line pg  1159 objects ( e.g. , fig .  1 of werner 2001 ) .",
    "the general picture ( cf .",
    "koesterke & werner 1998 ; werner 2001 ; koesterke 2001 ; liebert 2008 , fig .",
    "1 ) is that , as such stars evolve to lower luminosity , the strong radiatively driven winds of [ wce ] objects gradually diminish , weakening the emission - line spectrum and transitioning the star to a pg  1159 spectral type .",
    "this suggests that , for a pg  1159 star just finishing this slow transition , it might take only a small perturbation to move it back into the [ wce ] stage .",
    "a possible speculation is that occasionally many pulsation modes may be in phase , giving a temporarily large surface - temperature amplitude , which might trigger the outbursts .",
    "if so , we might expect the outbursts to occur periodically , at the beat period between the pulsation modes .",
    "however , i could find no obvious period that would predict the outburst dates listed in table  1 without also predicting outbursts that were not seen to occur .",
    "if we adopt the outburst mass - loss rate of @xmath21 given above , and if the star is in outburst @xmath05% of the time , the integrated mass - loss rate from lo  4 due to its outbursts is @xmath0@xmath22",
    ". there has not to my knowledge been a published estimate of the mass - loss rate for lo  4 in its normal low state .",
    "however , a rough comparison is provided by the estimates for the similar k  1 - 16 and ngc  246 of @xmath0@xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( koesterke & werner 1998 ) .",
    "thus the outbursts of lo  4 appear to have relatively little additional effect on the evolution of the star .",
    "we are left with a curious astrophysical puzzle : what is the origin of these episodic events in lo  4 ?",
    "it would be useful to monitor the spectra of other pnni lying near the [ wce]pg  1159 transition . a stringent test of the hypothesis that in - phase pulsations produce the lo  4 outbursts would be to search for the onset of an enhanced pulsation amplitude in the light curve and verify that a spectroscopic event is then triggered ; however , since we can not predict these outbursts in advance ,",
    "such a program would be very costly in telescope time .",
    "i thank the stsci director s discretionary research fund for supporting our participation in the smarts consortium , fred walter for scheduling the queue observations , and the expert chilean service observers who obtained the spectra during many long clear tololo nights : claudio aguilera , sergio gonzlez , manuel hernndez , rodrigo hernndez , alberto miranda , rustum nyquist , alberto pasten , and jos velsquez .",
    "klaus werner provided encouragement and useful discussion and comments .",
    "i thank robin ciardullo for pointing out zwicky s classical paper .",
