    "`` yes we do''_. there is a simple way to derive , in vacuum and in matter , the oscillation probability and apparently it describes well the available experimental data .",
    "however , i want to point out that not every aspect of theory of neutrino oscillation has been tested experimentally . for example , to my knowledge ,    * no one observed neutrinos directly in their mass eigenstates as a whole.b solar neutrinos detect @xmath7 in a good approximation .",
    "but , it still detects @xmath8 component of @xmath7 if one uses cc reaction .",
    "detection by nc reaction does not alter this situation , because a particular component of @xmath7 causes the reaction in each time .",
    "] it probably requires detection of neutrinos by gravitational effects , and in this context , cosmological observation is likely to be the first runner to achieve the goal , see e.g. , @xcite . *",
    "nobody observed the effect of neutrino s wave packet .",
    "see for example @xcite for a recent treatment .",
    "if someone could develop technology which has sensitivity to the size or shape of the wave packet , then it would become possible to see it .",
    "if the time resolution of detector is improved dramatically , in principle , it may allow us to detect the effect of superluminal neutrinos due to oscillation - driven modification of shape of the wave packet in flight @xcite .",
    "i said in the above that `` there is a simple way to derive the oscillation probability in vacuum and in matter '' .",
    "in fact , this comment is only true for the regime in which single-@xmath9 dominance approximation applies , and the things are quite different beyond it .",
    "now , the various neutrino experiments entered into the regime where the three - flavor effects become important . or , precision of measurement became so high that it has sensitivity to the sub - leading effects .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the accelerator neutrino experiment @xcite is the best example for the former because the cp phase effect , not only @xmath10 but also @xmath11 effect , is the genuine three - flavor effect .",
    "this is best understood by the general theorems derived in refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath10 terms ) and @xcite ( @xmath11 terms ) .    let us focus on the accelerator neutrino experiment because it will play a major role in observing the cp phase effect in a robust way @xcite . in the regime where the three - flavor effect is important",
    "our theoretical understanding of the neutrino oscillation probability is not quite completed in my opinion .",
    "let me first try to convince the readers on this point",
    ". for pedagogical purpose , i start from neutrino oscillation in vacuum .",
    "if you want to know the key point go directory to section  [ sec : matter - simple ] .",
    "the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum is simple .",
    "if only two generations of neutrinos ( @xmath5 and @xmath12 ) exist it takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the mixing angle and @xmath15 .",
    "the variable @xmath16 in the sine function is nothing but the phase difference between the mass eigenstates @xmath17 and @xmath18 which is developed when neutrinos travelled a distance @xmath19 . whereas the strength of the oscillation is determined by the transition amplitude @xmath20",
    ".    in nature the three - generation neutrinos exist , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) in the favor basis and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) in the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "let us define the mns lepton flavor mixing matrix @xcite as @xmath25 .",
    "then , the neutrino oscillation probability has richer structure with more terms with different characteristics : @xmath26    \\sin^2 \\frac { \\delta m^2_{ji } l } { 4e }   \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   8 ~{\\mbox i m } [ u_{\\alpha 1 } u_{\\beta 1}^ * u_{\\alpha 2}^ * u^ { } _ { \\beta 2 } ]    ~\\sin \\frac { \\delta m^2_{32 } l } { 4e }   \\sin \\frac { \\delta m^2_{21 } l } { 4e }   \\sin",
    "\\frac { \\delta m^2_{31 } l } { 4e } .",
    "\\label{eq : p - ba - general - vacuum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition to the proliferation of the conventional term that appear in ( [ eq : p - ee - vacuum ] ) due to the three mass - squared differences , there arises a universal cp and t violating term , the last one in ( [ eq : p - ba - general - vacuum ] ) .",
    "the term is suppressed by the two small factors , the jarlskog factor @xcite @xmath27 = c_{12 } s_{12 } c_{23 } s_{23 } c^2_{13 } s_{13 } \\sin \\delta < 0.035 $ ] , and @xmath28 assuming that @xmath29 .",
    "they both indicates that the cp violation is a genuine three flavor effect .",
    "it is well known that under the constant matter density approximation the neutrino oscillation probability in matter can be expressed in the form in ( [ eq : p - ba - general - vacuum ] ) , but with replacement @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mixing matrix in matter defined as @xmath32 with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) being the mass eigenstate in matter . @xmath35",
    "denote the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in matter , @xmath36 u^{\\dagger } + \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   \\right\\ } ,   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the wolfenstein matter potential @xcite with electron number density @xmath38 and the fermi constant @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian governs the evolution of neutrino states as @xmath40 .",
    "then , you may say that the oscillation probability in matter , eq .  ( [ eq : p - ba - general - vacuum ] ) with the replacement ( [ eq : replacement ] ) , is structurally very simple .",
    "it is true .",
    "even more amazingly one can obtain the exact expressions of the @xmath41 matrix elements @xcite .",
    "however , you will be convinced if you look into the resulting expressions by yourself that they are terribly complicated , and it is practically impossible to read off some physics from the expressions .",
    "sorry , i have no space here to introduce you the beautiful method for calculating the @xmath41 matrix elements introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and demonstrate the complexity of the resultant expression .      here is a natural question you may raise : `` is nt it possible to compute the eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath31 perturbatively ? and @xmath41 matrix elements by the small parameter does not work .",
    "this question is briefly addressed in @xcite . ]",
    "if you take this way you must be able to obtain much simpler analytic expressions of the oscillation probabilities . ''",
    "yes , of course you can .",
    "but , when you engage this business you discover that the eigenvalues @xmath42 receives the first order corrections .",
    "when you expand by the small parameters your formulas for the oscillation probabilities do not remain to the structure - revealing form ( [ eq : p - ba - general - vacuum ] ) .",
    "usually you obtain proliferation of terms , and the situation becomes much worse when you go to higher orders .",
    "this is the characteristic feature of the expressions obtained by the perturbative frameworks so far examined , to our understanding .",
    "expanded to third order in @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and even including the nsi parameters to the same order , which spanned 3 pages when it is explicitly written .",

    "if you are interested in seeing the other ( but much less pronounced ) examples see section 3.3.6 in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "since it is very hard to collect all the relevant references in which the various perturbative frameworks are developed , please look at the bibliography in @xcite for an incomplete list of references , from which you can start your own search .",
    "then , the immediate question would be `` ca nt you construct perturbation theory in which the first order corrections to the eigenvalues @xmath42 are absent ? '' .",
    "if we can , the proliferation of terms is avoided and the simple structure of the oscillation probabilities in ( [ eq : p - ba - general - vacuum ] ) is maintained to first order in the expansion parameter .",
    "the answer to the above question is _ yes _ and this is what we did in ref .",
    "the next question we must ask is then : how can we make the first order correction to the eigenvalues @xmath42 vanishes ? there is a simple way to make it happen .",
    "that is , if we choose the decomposition of the hamiltonian into the unperturbed and the perturbed parts correctly , then it is automatic .",
    "for concreteness i want to describe how it happens in the perturbative framework we have developed in @xcite .",
    "we first go to the tilde basis @xmath45 .",

    "this is not the end of the story .",
    "we have observed the following two `` unexpected '' new features .",

    "<S> this feature allows immediate physical interpretation of the formulas , and facilitates understanding of physics of neutrino oscillations in matter . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , quite recently , we have shown that our three - flavor oscillation probabilities @xmath3 in all channels can be expressed in the form of universal functions of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 disappearance oscillation probability @xmath6 has a special property that it can be written as the two - flavor form which depends on the single frequency . </S>",
