    "the increase of population and diversity of human activities , crowded scenes have been more frequent in the real world than ever .",
    "it brings enormous challenges to public management , security or safety .",
    "some examples of crowded scenes are shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "humans have the ability to extract useful information of behavior patterns in the surveillance area , monitor the scene for abnormal situations in real time , and provide the potential for immediate response @xcite .",
    "however , psychophysical research indicates that there are severe limitations in their ability to monitor simultaneous signals @xcite .",
    "extremely crowded scenes require monitoring an excessive number of individuals and their activities , which is a significant challenge even for a human observer .    in the past decade ,",
    "automated scene understanding or analysis has already attracted much research attention in the computer vision community @xcite .",
    "one important application is intelligent surveillance in replace of the traditional passive video surveillance . although many algorithms have been developed to track , recognize and understand the behaviors of various objects in video  @xcite , they were mainly designed for common scenes with a low density of population @xcite .",
    "when it comes to crowded scenes , the problems can not be handled well , since the large number of individuals involved not only cause the detection and tracking fail , but also greatly increase computational complexity . under such circumstance ,",
    "crowded scene analysis as a unique topic , is specifically addressed .",
    "driven by the practical demand , it is becoming an important research direction and has already attracted lots of efforts @xcite . the opportunity for such study has never been better .",
    "as noted in @xcite , scene understanding may refer to scene layout ( locating roads , buildings , sidewalks ) @xcite , motion patterns ( vehicles turning , pedestrian crossing ) @xcite and scene status ( crowd congestion , split , merge , etc . ) @xcite . in this paper , combined with previous studies",
    ", we will elaborate the key aspects of crowded scene analysis in automated video surveillance .",
    "research of crowded scene analysis could lead to a lot of critical applications .",
    "many places of security interests such as railway station and shopping mall are very crowded .",
    "conventional surveillance system may fail for high density of objects , regarding both accuracy and computation .",
    "we can leverage the results of crowd behavior analysis to crowd flux statistics and congestion analysis @xcite , anomaly detection and alarming @xcite , etc .      in mass gatherings",
    "such as music festivals and sports events , crowded scene analysis can be used to develop crowd management strategies and assist the movement of the crowd or individuals , to avoid the crowd disasters and ensure the public safety @xcite .",
    "the analysis of crowd dynamics and its relevant findings @xcite can provide some guidelines for public space design , and therefore increase the efficiency and safety of train stations , airport terminals , theaters , public buildings , and mass events in the future .      with the in - depth understanding of crowd phenomena , the establishment of mathematical models",
    "can provide more accurate simulation , which can be used in computer games , film and television industries @xcite .",
    "some recent works have been proposed to synthesize crowd videos with realistic microscale behavior  @xcite .",
    "video analysis and scene understanding usually involve object detection , tracking and behavior recognition @xcite . for crowded scenes , due to extreme clutters , severe occlusions and ambiguities , the conventional methods without special considerations are not appropriate .",
    "as ali pointed out @xcite , the mechanics of human crowds are complex as a crowd exhibits both dynamics and psychological characteristics , which are often goal directed .",
    "this makes it very challenging to figure out an appropriate level of granularity to model the dynamics of a crowd .",
    "another challenge in crowded scene analysis is that the specific crowd behaviors needed to be detected and classified may be both rare and subtle @xcite , and in most surveillance scenarios , these behaviors have few examples to learn .",
    "these challenges have partially drawn attention at some recent conferences , and several relevant scientific papers have also been published in academic journals . in this paper , we try to explore those problems with a comprehensive review and general discussions .",
    "the state - of - the - art technical advances in crowded scene analysis will be covered .",
    "feature extraction , segmentation and model learning are considered as core problems addressed in visual behavior analysis @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the methods in crowded scene analysis regarding these basic issues .",
    "it is noted that survey papers @xcite relevant to the topic of crowd analysis have been written in the past few years .",
    "@xcite presented a survey in 2008 on crowd analysis methods in computer vision .",
    "they covered the techniques of crowd density estimation , pedestrian / crowd recognition and crowd tracking .",
    "they paid much attention on the perspectives from other research disciplines , such as sociology , psychology and computer graphics , to the computer vision approach .",
    "the paper @xcite by junior _",
    "et al . _ in 2010 also presented a survey on a wide range of computer vision techniques for crowd analysis , covering people tracking , crowd density estimation , event detection , validation and simulation .",
    "they devoted large sections to reporting how related the areas of computer vision and computer graphics should be to deal with challenges in crowd analysis . later in 2011 , sjarif _ et al . _",
    "@xcite wrote a survey with more emphasis on abnormal behaviors detection in crowded scenes .",
    "recently , thida _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a general review on crowd video analysis , providing some valuable summarizations .",
    "but still many recent important works have been missed , and the descriptions of methods were rather brief .    in this study , we seek to create a more focused review of recent publications on high - level crowded scene understanding , related to motion and behavior analysis in crowd videos .",
    "several important recent works from 2010 to now will be covered and compared , which have not yet been surveyed previously . in order to better elaborate this topic ,",
    "we divide it into three subtopics according to the purposes of task : motion pattern segmentation , crowd behavior recognition and anomaly detection .",
    "it is indicated that these three aspects are closely related to each other in crowded scene analysis @xcite .",
    "differently from previous survey such as @xcite , crowd counting or density estimation , a closely related topic  @xcite , is not covered in this survey .",
    "we intend to cover the area related to the analysis of behaviors and activities in crowd videos , which is broad enough .",
    "the reviewed methods are all about the behaviors or activities , and are usually based on the motion features , while in crowd counting , static visual features can be important .    as an indispensable basis for each crowded scene analysis method , feature representation is discussed and summarized separately before elaboration of the three subtopics .",
    "feature representation can be shared by different methods .",
    "to clearly and properly situate the problem at hand for the readers , we still follow the task - orientated way to categorize the methods into three subtopics . besides",
    ", some background knowledge and available physical crowd models are provided beforehand .",
    "they could be utilized in the analysis methods .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] illustrates the diagram of crowded scene analysis .",
    "it also reveals what this paper is going to elaborate and explain .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] describes some background knowledge and physical models that could be utilized in crowded scene analysis . in section [ sec : feature ] , we introduce the features commonly used in the literature . in section [ sec : segmentation ] , the concept of motion pattern segmentation and the relevant approaches are detailed .",
    "section [ sec : recognition ] provides a detailed review on the topic of crowd behavior recognition , and the approaches for anomaly detection are elaborated in section [ sec : anomaly ] .",
    "section [ sec : dataset ] provides the detailed information of frequently used datasets for crowded scene analysis .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] and end this review by providing some promising future directions .",
    "crowded scenes can be divided into two categories according to the motion of the crowd@xcite : _ structured _ and _ unstructured_. in the structured crowded scenes , the crowd moves coherently in a common direction , the motion direction does not vary frequently , and each spatial location of the scene contains only one main crowd behavior over the time .",
    "the unstructured crowded scenes represent the scenes with chaotic or random crowd motion , where participants move in different directions at different times , and each spatial location contains multiple crowd behaviors  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1](a ) is structured crowded scenes , while figure [ fig : fig1](b ) is unstructured scenes .",
    "obviously , they have different dynamic and visual characteristics .",
    "the crowd has been defined as  a large group of individuals in the same physical environment , sharing a common goal \" @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed hierarchically : individuals are collected into groups , and the resulting groups are collected into a crowd , with a set of motivations and basic rules @xcite .",
    "this representation permits a flexible analysis of a large spectrum of crowd densities and complicated behaviors .",
    "the analysis of crowd can be conducted at macroscopic or microscopic levels . at the macroscopic level , we are interested in the global motions of a mass of people , without concerning the movements of any individual ; at the microscopic level , we concern the movements of each individual pedestrian and do analyze based on the collective information of them",
    ".    the analysis of crowded scenes could involve the knowledge from both vision area and crowd dynamics . except for the vision algorithms usually adopted in conventional scene analysis",
    ", the physical models from crowd dynamics could also be utilized . in the below",
    "we will introduce some available knowledge such as the models from crowd dynamics , as well as their application in crowded scene analysis .",
    "crowd dynamics have been studied intensively for more than 40 years .",
    "it can be considered as the study of how and where crowds form and move above the critical density level @xcite , and how individuals in the crowd interact with each other to influence the crowd status . in the past , studies were mainly conducted in order to support planning of urban infrastructure , e.g. , building entrances and corridors @xcite .",
    "there are two major approaches for computational modeling of crowd behavior : continuum - based approach and agent - based approach . in crowd simulation , both of them",
    "have been frequently used in to reproduce crowd phenomena .",
    "continuum - based approach works better at the macroscopic level for medium and high density crowds , while the agent - based approach is more suitable for low density crowds at the microscopic level , where the movement of each individual pedestrian is concerned .    for the continuum - based approach ,",
    "the crowd is treated as a physical fluid with particles , thus a lot of analytical methods from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are introduced @xcite .",
    "hughes _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have developed a model representing pedestrians as a continuous density field , and have presented a pair of elegant partial differential equations describing the crowd dynamics .",
    "moreover , a real - time crowd model based on continuum dynamics has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it could yield a set of dynamic potentials and velocity fields to guide the individuals motions .    for the agent - based approach ,",
    "individuals in the crowd are considered as autonomous agents which actively sense the environment and make decisions according to some predefined rules @xcite .",
    "following this style , the social force model ( sfm ) , first proposed by helbing _",
    "@xcite , has been proven to be capable of reproducing specific crowd phenomena .",
    "the assumption is that the interaction force between pedestrians is a significant feature for analyzing crowd behaviors .",
    "the sfm can be formulated as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the mass of the individual , @xmath2 indicates its actual velocity which varies given the presence of obstacles in the scene , @xmath3 is a relaxing parameter , @xmath4 indicates the interaction force encountered by the individual defined as the sum of attraction and repulsive forces , and @xmath5 is the desired velocity of the individual .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] visualizes of the forces and velocities in sfm .",
    "generalized sfm has been adopted as the basic model in many studies of crowd behavior analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the calibrated agent - based framework proposed in @xcite could also accurately model a number of observed crowd phenomena .",
    "there has been a series of attempts to incorporate the research findings of crowd simulation to automatic crowded scenes analysis  @xcite .",
    "several physics - inspired crowd models have been utilized for the purposes of recognition and classification @xcite .",
    "to analyze at the macroscopic level , usually holistic properties of the scene are modeled .",
    "assuming that high density crowd behaves like a complex dynamic system , many dynamical crowd evolution models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the concepts of motion field and dynamical potential borrowed from fluid dynamics community were utilized@xcite .",
    "the motion field is a rich dynamical descriptor of the flow which can be related to the velocity of flow , while the potential accounts for several physical quantities such as the density or the pressure in the flow .",
    "although people do not always follow the laws of physics , they have choices in their direction , have no conservation of momentum and can stop and start at willing @xcite , the coupling of crowd dynamics and real data has exhibited promising results in crowd video analysis and opened a rich area of research .    at the microscopic level , agent - based models have also been popular in video analysis .",
    "they analyze the stimuli , or driven factors of crowd behavior , based on the assumption that crowd behavior originates from the interaction of its elementary individuals .",
    "_ @xcite and zhao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the sfm to detect the abnormal events of the crowd .",
    "@xcite used dynamic pedestrian - agent model to learn the collective behavior patterns of pedestrians in crowded scenes .",
    "it is noted that cues from the two levels could be jointly used .",
    "for example , @xcite employ the global motion information to improve tracking individuals in a crowd scene .",
    "also the microscopic information of individual movements can be used as basic units in the holistic scene models .    besides , visual feature extraction , object tracking , learning , and other related algorithms from vision area also play important roles in crowded scene analysis .",
    "they will be given brief introductions in method descriptions .",
    "as a crucial basis , an appropriate feature representation can benefit the subsequent tasks .",
    "motion information representation is the basis for crowded scene analysis .",
    "although other types of visual features such as scene structure , geometrical information and viewing direction could also be helpful , motion features are dominant in our interested area .    according to the representation level",
    ", previous crowd motion features can be categorized into three categories : flow - based features , local spatio - temporal features and trajectory / tracklet .",
    "flow - based features are extracted densely on the pixel level .",
    "local spatio - temporal features represent the scene based on local information from 2d patches or 3d cubes . on a higher level",
    ", trajectory / tracklet tries to compute the individual tracks , as the basic features for motion representation .",
    "these feature representations have been used in various tasks as motion pattern segmentation , crowd behavior recognition and crowd anomaly detection .      in the context of high density crowded scenes , tracking a person or an object is always a difficult task , and sometimes unfeasible . fortunately ,",
    "when we look at crowd , we care about what is happening , not who is doing it .",
    "the specific actions of individual pedestrians may appear relatively random , but the overall look of the crowd can still be convincing @xcite . for that reason , several optical - flow alike features have been presented in recent years @xcite , these methods avoid tracking from the macroscopic level and have achieved some success in addressing complex crowd flows in the scenes .",
    "optical flow is to compute pixel - wise instantaneous motion between consecutive frames @xcite .",
    "optical flow is robust to multiple and simultaneous camera and object motions , and it is widely used in crowd motion detection and segmentation @xcite .",
    "however , optical flow does not capture long - range temporal dependencies , and can not represent spatial and temporal properties of a flow .",
    "these properties can be useful for many applications .",
    "recently , based on the lagrangian framework of fluid dynamics @xcite , a notion of particle flow was introduced in computer vision @xcite .",
    "particle flow is computed by moving a grid of particles with the optical flow through numerical integration , providing trajectories that relate a particles initial position to its position at a later time .",
    "impressive results employing particle flow have been demonstrated on crowd segmentation @xcite and abnormal crowd behavior detection @xcite .",
    "however , in particle flow the spatial changes are ignored , and time delay is significant .      in order to achieve an accurate representation of the flow from crowd motion , mehran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of streakline to compute the motion field for crowd video scene analysis , referred to as streak flow .",
    "they also provided the comparison between optical flow , particle flow and streak flow with discussion .",
    "streaklines are well known in flow visualization @xcite and fluid mechanics @xcite as a tool for measurement and analysis of the flow .",
    "it encapsulates motion information of the flow for a period of time .",
    "this resembles particle flow where the advection of a grid of particles provides information for segmenting the crowd motion .",
    "streak flow exhibits changes in the flow faster than particle flow , and therefore captures crowd motions better in a dynamically changing flow .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] gives an example of the optical flow feature .",
    "it also shows a comparison of optical flow , particle flow and streak flow using a locally uniform flow field changing over time .",
    "some extremely crowded scenes , though similar in density , are less structural due to the high variability of pedestrian movements .",
    "the motion within each local area may be non - uniform and generated by any number of moving objects .",
    "in such circumstances , even a fine - grain representation , such as optical flow , would not provide enough motion information .",
    "one solution is to exploit the dense local motion patterns created by the subjects , and model their spatio - temporal relationships to represent the underlying intrinsic structure they form in the video @xcite .",
    "the related methods generally consider the motion as a whole , and characterize its spatio - temporal distributions based on local 2d patches or 3d cubes , such as spatio - temporal gradients @xcite , and histogram functions  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of spatio - temporal gradients has been utilized as the base representation @xcite . for each pixel _ i _ in patch _",
    "i _ , the spatio - temporal gradient @xmath6 is calculated as @xmath7^t = [ \\frac{\\partial i}{\\partial x}\\ \\frac{\\partial i}{\\partial y}\\ \\frac{\\partial i}{\\partial t}]^t\\ ] ] where _ x , y _ and _ t _ are the video s horizontal , vertical , and temporal dimensions , respectively .",
    "the 3d gradients of each pixel collectively represent the characteristic motion pattern within the patch . by capturing the steady - state motion behavior with the spatio - temporal motion pattern models , kratz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that unusual activities can be detected as statistical deviations naturally .",
    "motion histograms can be considered as a kind of motion information defined on local regions .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] illustrates the motion histograms calculated from three sample pixels .",
    "in fact it originally is ill - suited for crowd motion analysis , since computing motion orientation on a motion histogram is not only time - consuming but also error - prone due to the aligning problem .",
    "therefore , researchers have developed some more advanced features based on motion histogram @xcite . in the below brief descriptions",
    "are given .",
    "jodoin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a feature called orientation distribution function ( odf ) .",
    "it is the probability density function of a given motion orientation .",
    "opposed to motion histograms , odfs have no information on the magnitude of the flow .",
    "this makes the odf representation simpler ( 1d instead of 2d ) , and is a key advantage in computation for the upcoming motion pattern learning .",
    "cong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a novel feature descriptor called multi - scale histogram of optical flow ( mhof ) .",
    "it preserves not only the motion information , but also the spatial contextual information . for event representation",
    ", features of all types of bases with various spatial structures are concatenated as mhof . after estimating the motion field by optical flow , they partitioned the image into a few basic units , i.e. , 2d image patches or 3d spatio - temporal cubes , then extracted mhof from each unit .",
    "overall , spatio - temporal features have shown particular promise in motion understanding due to their strong descriptive power , and therefore , they have been widely used as in various tasks such as crowd anomaly detection .",
    "typical crowd motion is usually regular and repetitive , so that we can analyze crowd activities based on motion features extracted from trajectories of objects , such as relative distance between objects , acceleration , or motion energy .",
    "comparing with the the other two types of feature representations , trajectory / tracklet is more semantic and it seems to be attractive .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , traditional pipeline of object detection and the subsequent tracking of those detections can hardly perform accurate object detection and tracking , as the density of the crowd increases and the scene clutter becomes severe @xcite . considering the difficulties in obtaining complete trajectories ,",
    "a motion feature called tracklet has been proposed .",
    "a tracklet is a fragment of a trajectory obtained by the tracker within a short period .",
    "tracklets terminate when ambiguities caused by occlusions or scene clutters arise .",
    "they are more conservative and less likely to drift than long trajectories @xcite . in previous works @xcite",
    ", tracklets have been mainly used to be connected into complete trajectories for tracking or human action recognition . recently , several tracklet based approaches for learning semantic regions and clustering trajectories @xcite were proposed . in the approaches ,",
    "tracklets are often extracted from dense feature points and then a certain model is applied to enforce the spatial and temporal coherence between tracklets , to finally detect behavior patterns of pedestrians in crowded scenes .",
    "considering the characteristics of crowded scenes , such as the congestion level , the degree of occlusion between objects , whether there is obvious motion structure , the size of field view of camera , and the resolution of a single target in the scene , we can briefly summary to which scenarios these features are suitable :    * for outdoor scenes , often with wide field of view but low resolution for each target , we mainly aim to analyze the holistic crowd motion trends .",
    "the optical flow alike features are suitable .",
    "these features can be easily combined with flow - based models , which has priority in structured crowded scene analysis . * for indoor scenes , e.g. ,",
    "subway stations and shopping malls , the resolution of a single target is high enough and the crowd density may not be so high .",
    "the object trajectories or tracklet - based features may be good choices .",
    "these features are usually combined with agent - based models , which is applicable for analyzing activities or semantic regions in unstructured crowded scenes . * besides , when the field of view is not wide , but crowd density is high with severe occlusion , neither optical flow alike features nor tracklets will meet the requirements .",
    "various local spatio - temporal features could be considered .",
    "motion patterns learning is important in automated visual surveillance @xcite . in crowded scene analysis , it is highly desirable to analyze the motion patterns and obtain some high - level interpretation .",
    "the term _ motion pattern _ here refers to a spatial region of the scene that has a high degree of local similarity of the speed , as well as flow direction within the region and otherwise outside @xcite .",
    "motion patterns not only describe the segmentation in the spatial space , but also reflect the motion tendency in a period . these patterns can be joint or disjoint in the image space . they usually have a semantic level interpretation and contain sources and sinks of the paths described by the patterns .    to analyze motion patterns in crowded scenes , various methods have been proposed . according to the principle to segment or cluster the motions",
    ", these methods can be divided into three categories : flow field model based segmentation , similarity based clustering , and probability model based clustering .",
    "the first category tries to simulate the image spatial segmentation based on flow field models , and therefore tends to produce spatially continuous segments .",
    "the later two categories utilize various well - developed clustering algorithms , usually based on local motion features , e.g. , tacklets or motion video words .",
    "the resulting segments may be scattered , but they could be applicable to unstructured scenes with complex motions .      among many physical - based models applied in crowd analysis , flow field models  @xcite",
    "are well studied in crowd motion pattern segmentation . by treating a moving crowd as a time dependent flow field consisting of regions with qualitatively different dynamics , the motion patterns emerging from spatio - temporal interactions of the participants can be reflected .",
    "based on this kind of representations , methods such as edge - based segmentation , graph - based segmentation , watershed segmentation can be applied .",
    "ali _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the lagrangian particle dynamic to segment high density crowd flows . to uncover the spatial organization of the flow field ,",
    "clouds of particles generated by the crowd motion are examined . then lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) @xcite is utilized to map to the boundaries of different crowd segments . similar to the edges for image , the lcss for flow data can be used to segment flow regions of different dynamics .",
    "the proposed method of @xcite could reveal the underlying flow structures of velocity field , and it is insensitive to the scene density .",
    "however , slow motions might not be segmented out , and low crowd density might cause over - segmented .    to detect typical motion patterns in crowded scenes , hu _ et al . _ @xcite constructed a directed neighborhood graph to measure the closeness of motion flow vectors , and then grouped them into motion patterns . based on the same idea , hu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite later invented a method to learn dominant motion patterns in videos .",
    "this is accomplished by first detecting the representative modes ( sinks ) of motion patterns , followed by construction of the super tracks , i.e. , collective representations of the discovered motion patterns .",
    "the methods do not require complete trajectories , avoiding the problem of occlusion .",
    "but they are not applicable to unstructured scenes and the number of motion patterns needs to be predefined .",
    "another approach is local - translational domain segmentation ( ltds ) model proposed in wu _",
    "local crowd motion is approximated as a translational motion field , and the evolution of domain boundaries is derived from the g@xmath8teaux derivative of an objective function . to represent crowd motion in an accurate and efficient way ,",
    "optical flow is computed at salient locations instead of all the pixel locations .",
    "then the problem of crowd motion partitioning is transformed to scattered motion field segmentation .",
    "this method can automatically determine the number of groups and can be applied to both medium and high density crowded scenes .    as introduced previously in section [ sec : feature ] , the streakline framework @xcite can recognize spatio - temporal flow changes more quickly than other methods .",
    "however , this framework computes the optical flow field using the conventional method .",
    "it has poor anti - interference performance , and serious deviation would be brought to the computation of the optical flow field . in @xcite ,",
    "wang _ et al . _ improved the streakline framework with a highly accurate variational model @xcite .",
    "different motion patterns are separated in crowded scenes by computing the similarity of streaklines and streak flows using watershed segmentation .",
    "this method finds a balance between recognition of local spatial changes and filling spatial gaps in the flow .",
    "but it must be noted that , the streak flow computation is vulnerable to disturbance , which may result in incorrect segmentation .",
    "flow field model based segmentation has shown success in handling high density scenes with complex crowd flows .",
    "however , the optical flow alike features are designed to detect local changes , not to recover long - range motion patterns .",
    "alternatively , the particle flow methods used in @xcite treat the crowd as a single entity , and ignore the spatial changes in coherent motion patterns .",
    "another disadvantage of the methods in @xcite is that they can not handle overlapping motion patterns , since each pixel is assigned to only one motion label .",
    "it is often not the case in unstructured scenes . in addition , with the decrease in crowd density , flow field model would no longer work , and cause the video scene to be over - segmented .",

    "the principle to classify crowd behavior recognition methods depends on the perspective from which we observe the crowd : a single entity or a bunch of independent individuals .",
