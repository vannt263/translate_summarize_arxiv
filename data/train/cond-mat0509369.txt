    "in the field of phase transitions and critical phenomena , the fourth order cumulant of the order parameter @xcite , the binder cumulant @xmath0 , plays an important role . among others ,",
    "the cumulant may be used to compute the critical exponent of the correlation length , and thence to identify the universality class of the transition .",
    "the value of the binder cumulant at the transition temperature , @xmath1 , the critical binder cumulant , has received much attention , too , indicating the universality class as well @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of the spin-1/2 ising model with ferromagnetic nearest ",
    "neighbour couplings the critical cumulant has been determined very accurately in numerical work , applying monte carlo techniques @xcite and transfer - matrix methods augmented by finite  size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the resulting value , @xmath2@xcite , has been observed to hold also for various other , ising  type models on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "quite recently , it has been demonstrated by chen and dohm @xcite that the critical binder cumulant may display non ",
    "universal features , when the couplings on the square lattice are anisotropic .",
    "more specifically , they have studied critical effects of the anisotropy matrix of the landau  ginzburg ",
    "wilson hamilitonian , consisting of the coefficients in front of the leading , second  order gradient term of the hamiltonian .",
    "a nondiagonal matrix is shown to imply that the isotropic case can not be restored by a rescaling of lengths , i. e. in choosing suitable aspect ratios on a rectangular geometry .",
    "such a scale transformation is possible in the case of a diagonal anisotropy matrix , for instance , for nearest  neighbour ising models with two different couplings along the axes of the square lattice @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we shall present results of rather extensive monte carlo simulations for a variety of anisotropic ising models on a square lattice , corresponding to diagonal and nondiagonal anisotropy matrices .",
    "our data agree qualitatively with the recent results by chen and dohm @xcite on nonuniversality in the case of a nondiagonal matrix .",
    "they confirm quantitatively the scale transformation given by kamieniarz and blte @xcite in the case of a diagonal matrix .",
    "we consider spin-1/2 ising models on a square lattice with anisotropic nearest and next  nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the spin at site @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "1 . in most cases , we take all couplings to be positive , i. e. ferromagnetic . in the monte carlo simulations , systems with @xmath6 spins , subject to full periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "are analysed , where @xmath7 corresponds to the @xmath8direction .",
    "the aspect ratio , @xmath9 , is defined by @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the critical binder cumulant is defined by @xcite    @xmath11    taking the thermodynamic limit , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the second and fourth moments of the magnetization , @xmath15 .",
    "we studied especially two types of anisotropy . in the first case ,",
    "where both diagonal next ",
    "nearest neighbour couplings vanish , @xmath16 , the anisotropy matrix is diagonal @xcite .    in the second case , where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , one encounters nondiagonality @xcite .",
    "indeed , we consider the two  dimensional variant of a three  dimensional model which had been analysed by chen and dohm @xcite and subsequently investigated using monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "the simulations , however , may have been hampered by the fact that the critical phase transition temperature is not known exactly , in contrast to the present situation .    note that data of high accuracy are needed .",
    "we computed systems of sizes , @xmath19 , ranging typically from 4 to 64 for square lattices , @xmath20 . using the standard metropolis algorithm (",
    "a cluster flip algorithm becomes significantly more efficient for larger system sizes ) , monte carlo runs with up to @xmath21 monte carlo steps per site , for the largest systems , were performed , averaging then over several , about ten , of these runs to obtain final estimates and to determine the statistical error bars , shown in the figures .",
    "we computed not only the cumulant , but also other quantities like energy and specific heat , to check the accuracy of our data .",
    "of course , sufficiently small lattices may be solved easily by direct enumeration .       for ising models of size @xmath22 with @xmath23= 4.0 , 3.0 , and 2.0 ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "open symbols denote monte carlo data , full symbols , at @xmath24 , result from the scale transformation @xcite as described in the text .",
    "lines are guides to the eye . ]",
    "[ fig2 ]    we consider the anisotropic ising model eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with vanishing next  nearest neighbour interactions and different horizontal , @xmath25 , and vertical @xmath26 , nearest  neighbour interactions , see fig .",
    "then the anisotropy matrix is diagonal @xcite .",
    "the exact transition temperature is given by @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "following kamieniarz and blte @xcite , the critical binder cumulant for the anisotropic model on a square lattice , @xmath20 , in the thermodynamic limit , can be obtained from that of the isotropic case , @xmath29 , on a rectangular lattice with the aspect ratio @xmath10 using a scale transformation :    @xmath30    the critical cumulant @xmath1 of the isotropic case with arbitrary aspect ratio @xmath9 has been calculated before , extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit , with a high degree of accuracy resulting in a polynomial representation of @xmath1 in @xmath9 @xcite . note that this critical cumulant decreases monotonically from its maximal value at @xmath31 to zero , when the aspect ratio is increased to infinity @xcite ( or lowered to zero , because of the obvious symmetry when replacing @xmath9 by @xmath32 ) , i. e. when approaching the one  dimensional limit of the model .    in fig .",
    "2 we display results of our check on that scale transformation , showing our monte carlo results of @xmath1 for anisotropic ising systems , @xmath33 , of small and moderate sizes , @xmath34 .",
    "we also include the values we obtained by evaluating the previously reported polynomial results for the isotropic case with the appropriate , see eq .",
    "( 4 ) , aspect ratio @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we find a very good , quantitative agreement between our monte carlo data and the values based on the scale transformation and the polynomial representation @xcite .",
    "this observation confirms the universality of the critical binder cumulant in the case of a diagonal anisotropy matrix .      , with @xmath35= 0.0 ( squares ) , 1.0 ( triangles up ) , 1.5 ( triangles left ) , and 2.5 ( triangles down ) .",
    "open symbols denote our monte carlo ( as well as numerically exact data for small lattices ) , full symbols , at @xmath24 , denote previous estimates following from finite  size extrapolations @xcite . ]",
    "[ fig3 ]    now , we consider the case where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , while @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "the model has been called , albeit being defined on a square lattice , the anisotropic triangular model @xcite , because of an obvious isomorphy .",
    "its anisotropy matrix is nondiagonal @xcite .",
    "again , the exact transition temperature is known @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are supposed to be ferromagnetic in the following , unless stated otherwise ( a weakly antiferromagnetic @xmath40 does not destroy the ferromagnetic order at low temperatures @xcite ) . some of our simulational results for the binder cumulant at @xmath41 for square lattices , @xmath42 , with ferromagnetic couplings",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "3 , together with highly accurate estimates based on finite  size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit @xcite in the cases @xmath43 , being the isotropic nearest neighbour square ising model , and @xmath44 , being the isotropic nearest neighbour triangular ising model . the monte carlo data seem to allow a smooth extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , providing reliable and accurate estimates ( we refrained from a quantitative finite  size  analysis , because , in general , the form of the corrections to scaling seems to be unknown ) .    results for extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit are depicted in fig .",
    "most importantly , the critical binder cumulant @xmath1 is seen to increase from its value in the isotropic , @xmath43 , case when introducing the diagonal interaction @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath1 seems to reach a maximum at about @xmath35= 1.0 , decreasing then , crossing the isotropic value at about @xmath46 ( possibly at @xmath47 , as one may speculate ) , and finally approaching the one  dimensional limit , where @xmath1 tends to go to zero , when @xmath39 becomes indefinitely weak compared to @xmath40 .",
    "as has been just emphasized , @xmath1 is initially , for @xmath48 , larger than in the isotropic limit .",
    "now , varying the aspect ratio and keeping the rectangular geometry in the isotropic ising model , this can only lead to a decrease in the critical binder cumulant @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to obtain the critical binder cumulant in the anisotropic case , @xmath34 and @xmath48 , by a scale transformation from the isotropic case , in contrast to the situation discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "obviously , this finding is in accordance with the analysis by chen and dohm @xcite .",
    "our findings do not rule out the possibility that special cases of the triangular and square models , choosing suitable aspect ratios and anisotropies , may be mapped onto each other , having the same critical cumulants @xcite .",
    "note that the critical cumulant seems to decrease monotonically when taking a weak antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath40 , as we find in preliminary simulations .    .",
    "full symbols denote estimates taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the isotropic case on a square lattice , @xmath40= 0 . ]",
    "[ fig4 ]    perhaps quite interestingly , the critical binder cumulant displays a non  monotonic behaviour when varying the aspect ratio for the anisotropic triangular model , when @xmath35 is sufficiently large .",
    "starting with the square lattice , @xmath9=1 , and then , say , enlargening ( or , equivalently due to symmetry , lowering ) the aspect ratio , @xmath1 first becomes larger , before finally decreasing again as one approaches the one  dimensional geometry .",
    "in summary , the monte carlo simulations show that for a diagonal anisotropy matrix , the critical binder cumulant in the anisotropic and isotropic cases are connected by a scale transformation keeping rectangular geometry .",
    "in marked contrast , such a scale transformation does not exist , in general , in the anisotropic triangular model described by a nondiagonal anisotropy matrix , for reasons which have been discussed recently by chen and dohm , demonstrating non  universal features in the critical binder cumulant @xcite .",
    "thence , care is needed in identifying universality classes and in estimating phase transition temperatures in using the critical binder cumulant .",
    "we thank especially v. dohm for informing us about his work with x. s. chen , which , in turn , motivated our work , as well as for very illuminating discussions .",
    "we also thank d. stauffer for useful information on the three  dimensional variant of the model considered in this letter .",
