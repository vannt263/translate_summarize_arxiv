    "we will review the application of the holographic method to the calculation of the glueball spectrum in the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory . for this purpose the holographic model of klebanov and strassler  @xcite will be employed .",

    "we also find that the available results , _ e.g. _ the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are also consistent with the lattice results beyond our expectations .",
    "the review is based on a series of works  @xcite-@xcite , in which the glueball spectrum of the klebanov - strassler theory was studied .",
