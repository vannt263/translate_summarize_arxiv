    "the interest in the provocative behavior of the glass - forming liquid bef@xmath0 has been recently renewed in an effort to relate a viscosity anomaly to some water - like features , such as the existence of a negative thermal expansion coefficient region @xcite .",
    "since the first appearance of the @xmath8-scaled temperature dependence of the viscosity plot for glass - forming systems , it became clear that liquid bef@xmath0 has an intriguing property : it shows a crossover between the two extreme strong and fragile behaviors . in particular , using existing viscosity data @xcite angell and co -",
    "workers have shown that -in a @xmath8-scaled plot- the high - temperature limit of bef@xmath0 viscosity obtained by extrapolation should reach an un - physically small value @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have recently been performed @xcite to explain the above observation in terms of a weak thermodynamic anomaly . in particular ,",
    "a density maximum has been predicted to occur at @xmath1@xmath9 2000 k and a density minimum at @xmath1@xmath9 1250 k , a temperature at which a considerable ( @xmath930@xmath10 ) rise in heat capacity was also predicted .    despite these intriguing thermodynamics anomalies ,",
    "bef@xmath0 is much less studied compared to other network forming glasses like the oxides sio@xmath0 , geo@xmath0 , b@xmath0o@xmath7 etc .",
    ", owing to the subtleties that it presents in its purification procedure ( hygroscopicity , toxicity , corrosiveness etc . ) .    from the experimental point of view",
    "the structure of bef@xmath0 has been elucidated by x - ray @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction studies supporting the resemblance of bef@xmath0 structure with that of sio@xmath0 , i.e. a 3d network of corner sharing bef@xmath11 tetrahedral units .",
    "the room temperature raman spectrum of bef@xmath0 has been measured by galeener et al .",
    "@xcite where a comparison between this glass and other oxides is attempted . finally , dynamic properties of bef@xmath0 at low temperature and ultrasonic frequencies have been carried out @xcite showing that _",

    "in particular , in contrast to the monotonically decreasing sound speed with temperature rise which is usually found in glasses ( b@xmath0o@xmath7 , geo@xmath0 , zn(po@xmath7)@xmath0 ) , the sound speed of bef@xmath0 ( and of sio@xmath0 as well ) exhibits an initial drop followed by an upturn above  50 k.    in this paper , we present the first experimental determination of the acoustic properties of bef@xmath0 in the _ thz _ frequency range , by means of inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) .",
    "in particular , we have measured the dynamic structure factor , @xmath12 , at room temperature ( @xmath8=598 k ) _",

    "the obtained data allow us to extract some information about the high frequency sound dispersion and attenuation properties for the longitudinal acoustic excitations of this network forming glass .",
    "specifically , we find that _",

    "beryllium fluoride is a substance that presents considerable difficulties in its purification procedure .",
    "this stems from the fact that it is extremely hygroscopic , toxic and corrosive for conventional containers like fused silica tubes . for the above reasons the whole material handling operation took place in an inert atmosphere ( nitrogen - filled ) glove box with a water content less than 2 ppm while the material was melted in gold - plated silica tubes of 8 mm inner diameter .",
    "the bef@xmath0 starting material was purchased from alfa aesar chemical co. with nominal purity 99.5 @xmath10 which was not enough to obtaine a transparent glass / melt free of black spots .",
    "thus , bef@xmath0 was first sublimed under dynamic high vacuum and high temperature in graphite tubes . the material obtained after sublimation contained pure and contaminated parts from the container .",
    "the proper amount of pure bef@xmath0 was selected and placed into the gold - plated cylindrical silica crucibles with flat bottom .",
    "the crucibles with the pure bef@xmath0 were placed in a quartz cell that was evacuated , partially filled with ar , and flame sealed .",
    "this cell was then transferred into a furnace and heated up to the softening point of the glass ( 1100 k ) for 1 - 2 hours to obtain complete homogenization .",
    "the melt was cooled down to room temperature in a controlled way in order to obtain a transparent glass , free of internal stresses . with this procedure",
    "we were able to obtain cylindrical bef@xmath0 glass samples with a length of about 1 cm , comparable with the absorption length for 21.7 kev x - rays .",
    "characteristic temperatures of bef@xmath0 are : glass transition temperature @xmath21 598 k and melting point of both the quartz - like and cristobalite - like crystalline modifications @xmath22 k.    data for the bef@xmath0 glass have been collected at room temperature ( @xmath1=297 k ) at the ixs beamline id28 of esrf @xcite .",
    "the experiment has been performed at fixed exchanged wavevector over a @xmath23 region @xmath24 nm@xmath4 with a resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath25 nm@xmath4 .",
    "the overall energy resolution ( fwhm ) has been set to @xmath26 mev utilizing the ( 11 11 11 ) reflection for the si monochromator and crystal analyzers . a five - analyzers bench ,",
    "operating in horizontal scattering geometry , allowed us to collect simultaneously spectra at five different values of @xmath2 .",
    "each energy scan ( @xmath27 mev ) took about 300 minutes , and several scans have    been accumulated for a total integration time of about 500 seconds / point .",
    "measurements at constant energy have also been conducted , scanning over the scattering angle . in this case",
    "the energy resolution was the same as in the fixed @xmath2 scans , while the @xmath2 resolution was increased , @xmath28 nm@xmath4 , by using tunable - width slit placed on the scattered beam path .",
    "fig .  [ panel ] illustrates a selection of experimental spectra accumulated at the indicated @xmath2 values as a function of the exchanged energy @xmath13 .",
    "since the incident flux on the sample slightly varies during the acquisition of each scan , the data have been normalized to a monitor signal for each frequency value , and then multiplied by the average monitor .",
    "the data of fig . 1 bear a close resemblance with those collected from other network forming glasses , such as sio@xmath0 @xcite and b@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a strong elastic peaks dominates the spectra , and the inelastic features appear only as weak shoulders on the tail of the resolution - broadened elastic line . in order to extract quantitative information on the excitations giving rise to the inelastic signal , we fitted the the experimental data with a model function for the @xmath29 convoluted with the instrumental resolution .",
    "in fact , the actual experimental intensity , @xmath30 , is proportional to the convolution of the dynamic structure factor , @xmath31 , ( @xmath32 ) , with the instrumental resolution function @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34    where @xmath35 contains the efficiency of the analyzers , the atomic form factors and other angular - dependent correction factors .",
    "the true , quantum , @xmath31 can be approximately related to its classic counterpart by    @xmath36    an useful expression for the ( classical ) dynamic structure factor can be obtained by recalling that its fourier transform in the frequency domain , i.e. the density fluctuation correlation function @xmath37 , obeys a generalized langevin equation @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a parameter related to the static structure factor @xmath40 @xcite , and @xmath41 is the `` memory function '' . in this `` exact '' expression",
    "all the difficulties associated to the calculation of @xmath42 have been transferred to the determination of @xmath41 , with the advantage that the first two sum rules for @xmath12 are automatically satisfied @xcite . by fourier transforming eq .",

    "the latter contribution to the memory function -often referred to as `` microscopic '' or `` instantaneous''- is usually represented as a delta - function with area @xmath50 . therefore : @xmath51 and hence eq .",

    "the expression in eq .",
    "[ dho ] is the sum of an elastic line ( the frozen @xmath49 process ) accounting for a fraction @xmath54 of the total intensity , and of an inelastic feature which is formally identical to a damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) function .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 coincides with the maximum of the longitudinal current correlation function , @xmath56 , and it is related to the apparent sound speed value @xmath57 , while @xmath58 , the excitation width , is related through its low @xmath2 value to the acoustic absorption coefficient @xmath59 .",

    "[ panel ] , together with the raw data ( circles ) , we report the the elastic contribution ( dashed lines ) , the fits to the data ( full lines ) and the inelastic contribution ( dotted lines ) .",
    "this latter contribution clearly shows a dispersing behavior despite the considerable sound attenuation ( @xmath65 at @xmath66 nm@xmath4 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ disp ] ( upper panel ) we report the best fit values of @xmath67 ( dots ) along with the dispersion obtained in the low frequency ( ultrasound ) limit ( dotted line , corresponding to the adiabatic sound speed @xmath68 m / s @xcite ) . to represent the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath15 we utilized the expression @xmath69 in order to keep into account for the bending of the dispersion curve associated to the existence of a quasi - brillouin zone .",
    "this procedure yielded for the sound speed @xmath70 , a value that , as in the case of vitreous silica @xcite , exceeds its low frequency value .",
    "the higher value of the high frequency sound velocity could be the signature of the crossing of some relaxation process .",
    "such a process can not be the structural relaxation , since in the glass it lies in the sub-@xmath71 region , while it can be ascribed to the action of a microscopic process -produced by the topological disorder that is present in the glassy phase , as demonstrated in the case of simulated monatomic glasses @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis implies that the assumption of an instantaneous decay of the memory function in eq .",
    "[ memdho ] may be inadequate ; unfortunately , however , the low magnitude of the inelastic to elastic ratio does not allow us for a more realistic ansatz for the memory function shape .",
    "the excitation width @xmath64 is reported as a function of @xmath2 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "its @xmath2-dependence is compatible with the law already found in all the glasses where the dynamic structure factor has been measured in the mesoscopic region : @xmath72 .",
    "actually , a fit to the data with the law @xmath73 ( full line ) results in @xmath74=1.96@xmath750.05 and @xmath76=1.05@xmath750.05 mev / nm@xmath77 .    in order to further illuminate the previous results ,",
    "the dynamic structure factor has also been measured at a fixed exchanged energy value as a function of the momentum transfer . in the constant @xmath2 scans ( as those reported in fig .  1 ) ,",
    "indeed , the inelastic signal always appears as a shoulder of the resolution broadened central line , so that the choice of an appropriate model for the @xmath12 can be , in principle , neither easy nor unique @xcite . in a constant @xmath13 scan , on the contrary ,",
    "the inelastic signal is more clear , since the ( resolution broadened ) elastic contribution appears as an almost flat , @xmath2-independent , background .",
    "moreover , the parameters determined trough the best fit to the energy scan data can be utilized to build - up a curve that can be compared to the constant @xmath13 experimental data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ qscan ] we present , as an example , the result of such a comparison for a scan at @xmath13=7 mev : in the upper panel we show the raw experimentally measured elastic , @xmath78 mev@xmath79 , and inelastic , @xmath80 mev@xmath79 data .",
    "obviously , the latter data contain an elastic contribution as a consequence of the finite energy resolution . in order to subtract this elastic contribution we used a series of spectra at constant @xmath2 taken between @xmath2=23 and 32 nm@xmath4 .",
    "after aligning and scaling the experimentally determined resolution function to the elastic peaks in the spectra at high @xmath2 , we estimate the relative intensity between the elastic and inelastic signals at the energy transfers utilized in the constant-@xmath13 spectra .",
    "the elastic to inelastic intensity ratio has been obtained at @xmath2=13 , 16 , 19 , and 22 nm@xmath4 .",
    "these ratios allow us to put in the correct relative scale the spectra taken at @xmath13=7 mev and at @xmath13=0 .",
    "this normalization procedure is used to derive the inelastic part of the @xmath29 by the subtraction of the normalized elastic contribution from the total scattered intensity .",
    "the difference spectrum at @xmath137 mev is reported in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ qscan ] ( circles ) together with the error bars as derived from the counting statistics . in this spectrum",
    "the existence of a defined brillouin peak is highly emphasized . the dashed line in the lower panel of fig .",

    "[ disp ] ) , where the only adjustable parameter is now an intensity factor since @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath76 and @xmath74 are determined from the fit results of the energy scans .",
    "although the peak position turns out to be slightly underestimated , the proposed fitting model appears to capture the main features of the experimental data .",
    "the convergent results obtained by analyzing the two independent data sets , i.  e. the constant-@xmath2 and -@xmath13 scans , allow us to establish the appropriateness of the approximations introduced in the memory function of the density fluctuations , and , more specifically , of the results reported in fig .",

    "one of the most intriguing topics , as far as the glassy dynamics is concerned , is the frequency ( or @xmath2 ) dependence of the sound attenuation . despite that in the ixs window",

    "in conclusion , a room temperature ixs study of glassy bef@xmath0 has been undertaken in the present work . in accordance with all previous studies in strong and fragile glasses",
    ", evidence has been presented for well - defined propagating ( high frequency ) acoustic modes , whose frequency position and linewidth scale as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal speed of sound for glassy bef@xmath0 has been estimated to exceed its low frequency ( ultrasonic ) limit by almost 5@xmath10 ; a case analogous to that found in studies of vitreous silica .",
    "the extrapolation of the high - frequency linewidth conforms nicely with the value obtained from ultrasonic studies , and exhibits a scenario similar to that of vitreous silica .",
    "another similarity which deserves further study is that the temperature dependence ( in a t@xmath92-scaled plot ) of the non - ergodicity factor , as determined from the ratio of the elastic to the total scattered intensity , follows the behavior exhibited by sio@xmath0 ( fig.[fq ] ) while for less strong glasses the drop of @xmath90 is much faster with increasing temperature .",

    "there is often confusion about the relation of the sound absorption with the brillouin linewidth . in particular , @xmath93 is sometimes reported as the full width at half maximum while some other times is the half width at half maximum .",
