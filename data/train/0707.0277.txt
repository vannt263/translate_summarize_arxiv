    "the kondo - lattice model ( klm ) is one of the most analyzed models in solid state theory due to its large variety of applications .",
    "quite generally , the klm describes the interaction between localized spins and a band of conduction electrons .",
    "one particular class of systems , where such a situation can be realized , are the transition metal oxides , which have received considerable interest due to their rich phase diagram comprising different types of magnetic and orbital order and even supercondunctivity.@xcite this complexity stems from the interplay between the formation of narrow @xmath1-bands leading to a delocalization of these states on the one hand and the local part of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath1-electrons tending to localize them.@xcite a particularly interesting example is la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath4@xcite . in this cubic perovskite the five - fold degenerate @xmath1 level is split by crystal field into three - fold degenerate @xmath5 , which have the lower energy , and two - fold degenerate @xmath6 states .",
    "these states have to be filled with @xmath7 electrons , nominally yielding a metal even for @xmath8 .",
    "however , taking into account the local coulomb interaction , three of these electrons will occupy the @xmath5-states forming an @xmath9 high - spin state due to hund s coupling , which interacts ferromagnetically with the electron occupying the @xmath6 states . besides its complicated phase diagram with a large variety of paramagnetic and magnetically ordered metallic and insulating phases one finds a colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr).@xcite the physics just described",
    "can be covered in great parts by the klm , in this context usually called double exchange model ( de).@xcite    another class of materials which can be addressed by the klm with ferromagnetic exchange interaction between conduction states and the localized spin degrees of freedom are magnetic semiconductors or semi - metals in the series of the rare earth monopnictides and monochalcogenides.@xcite here the focus lies on the magnetic respectively magneto - optic properties of for example eus , euo , gdn or thin films of such systems.@xcite    last but not least the ferromagnetic klm can be applied to investigate the magnetic properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors such as ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as . in these materials the iii - v semiconductor gaas becomes ferromagnetic by introducing magnetic ions,@xcite such as mn .",
    "the local spin of the mn - ions couples ferromagnetically to the states of the semiconductor , a setup which can be modeled by the klm .",
    "note , however , that in these materials disorder effects are expected to play a vital role.@xcite    a completely different realization of the klm starts from the periodic anderson model ( pam),@xcite a model for heavy fermion physics.@xcite heavy fermion physics manifests itself in a number of lanthanide and actanide compounds , which have a very large effective mass in common .",
    "the low - temperature physics of these compounds is determined by a partly filled f shell and hybridization induced spin flip scattering between the f and conduction electrons . by a schrieffer - wolff - transformation@xcite",
    "the periodic anderson model can be mapped onto the klm with antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "note that in these materials one typically expects a competition between the heavy fermion physics , driven by the kondo effect due to the antiferromagnetic coupling , and the formation of antiferromagentism.@xcite    in most of the approaches one does not include coulomb interaction among the conduction band electrons . especially for manganites",
    "this is quite likely an insufficient approximation , because all the physics takes place in a correlated d - band , as explained above .",
    "there is no reason to ignore the local coulomb correlations in the itinerant subshells , in particular because estimates of its magnitude typically lead to values of the order or even larger than the bandwidth of the d states at the fermi level.@xcite therefore , we want to address the influence of these local coulomb correlations among the conduction band on the magnetic properties of the klm .",
    "generally , the 5-fold or 14-fold degenerate d- respectively f - shells split in a crystalline environment into more or less well separated subshells . here , we assume that the different crystal field levels are well separated on the scale of relevant low - energy structures  this is typically true in transition metal compounds , but less obvious in rare earth systems  and focus on a situation , where we have one subshell well localized , hosting a spin @xmath10 , while the remaining levels are split sufficiently to leave one relevant , spin - degenerate state close to the fermi energy .",
    "our model thus consists of a conventional one - band hubbard - model,@xcite where the itinerant states are in addition coupled to local spins @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 @xmath12 describes the ordinary hubbard model , @xmath13 where @xmath14 creates ( annihilates ) an electron at lattice site @xmath15 with spin @xmath16 .",
    "while the inclusion of an arbitrary hopping @xmath17 presents no principle problem , we focus on the simplest case of next - neighbor - hopping parametrized by an amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "finally , @xmath19 denotes the density operator for a @xmath20electron at site @xmath15 and @xmath21 parametrizes the local coulomb interaction .",
    "the band electrons are in addition coupled to a local spin @xmath22 at each lattice site by an exchange interaction @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spin operator for the band states at site @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed before , such a term can arise through hund coupling , in which case @xmath0 is ferromagnetic , or through a hybridization , leading to an antiferromagnetic @xmath0.@xcite note that both effects can appear simultaneously , thus partially compensating each other.@xcite    even without coulomb interaction @xmath21 this model is not exactly solvable in general , thus approximations have to be made .",
    "for @xmath25 , a first approach can consist of a perturbative treatment of the exchange interaction @xmath0 , leading to the well - known effective rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction@xcite with a characteristic , dimension - dependent dependence on distance .",
    "although generally accepted as an at least proper ansatz for a qualitative discussion of magnetic properties of models like the klm , it has not yet been studied in detail how well this approximation works for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , for the antiferromagnetic kondo lattice model , where heavy fermion physics can play an essential role , or in the presence of additional correlations in the band states , the validity of the use of the rkky arguments is far from clear .",
    "thus one aspect of the present paper is to investigate to what extent the rkky exchange indeed leads to a reasonable description of the low - temperature properties of the klm .    as approximation to study the klm while leaving as much of the local correlations induced by both the coulomb interaction @xmath21 and the exchange @xmath0 intact as possible we use the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite mapping the lattice model onto an effective impurity problem . in former treatments of the model ( [ model ] ) , especially within dmft,@xcite classical spins",
    "were assumed to avoid the sign problem of the quantum monte - carlo treatment of the effective impurity problem employed there .",
    "the importance of a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the local spins even in impurity problems has been addressed by @xcite and the effects of quantum spins in the klm by @xcite . to achieve such a fully quantum mechanical treatment we use wilsons s numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite as impurity solver .",
    "the nrg can handle the whole interaction and temperature regime and is also able to calculate green s function even in ordered phases .",
    "we use a recent improved technique for calculating green s functions@xcite within nrg .",
    "therefore we are able to treat a large bandwidth of values of both on - site interactions @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the form of the perturbative rkky exchange in the limit spatial dimension @xmath26 appropriate for the dmft . in section",
    "iii we present our results for the magnetic phase diagrams of the model ( [ model ] ) at half - filling and finite doping and different values of @xmath21 and discuss their dependence on the sign and magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "a summary will conclude the paper .",
    "conventionally the interaction between localized spins in metals is analyzed in terms of the rkky interaction.@xcite this effective exchange interaction shows a characteristic dependence on distance @xmath27 and local exchange coupling @xmath0 of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fermi momentum of the host and @xmath30 some positive , dimension - dependent number .",
    "this distance - dependence is due to the sharp fermi surface in metals and , strictly speaking , valid only in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "note that , because @xmath32 , the sign of @xmath0 does not matter .",
    "furthermore , it is a priori not evident , how the distance - dependence looks like in the limit spatial dimension @xmath26 , which sets the framework for the construction of the dmft . in particular , in this limit there is no proper definition of @xmath29 , which controls the dependence of @xmath33 on the occupancy of the band .",
    "thus , in order to be able to study to what extent the rkky interaction controls the magnetic properties of the klm in dmft , we will derive this interaction and especially its dependency on the filling for the limit @xmath26 in the following .    to this end",
    "we consider the extended hubbard model ( [ model ] ) on a hypercubic lattice . in the paramagnetic phase with @xmath34 ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian for the local spins can be calculated perturbatively in @xmath0 by formally tracing out the band states .",
    "the resulting expression in lowest order in @xmath0 reads @xmath35 s_j^\\alpha[0]\\rangle_{j=0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = &   -j^2\\sum\\limits_{ij}\\sum\\limits_{\\alpha=1}^3s_i^\\alpha s_j^\\alpha\\chi_{ij}^{\\alpha\\alpha}\\nonumber\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the static susceptibility of the bare hubbard model . in the paramagnetic case , @xmath36 does not depend on @xmath30 , and we are free to evaluate it for @xmath37 , for example .",
    "this leads to an effective spin - spin interaction @xmath38 let us evaluate the latter sum for a model with nearest - neighbor hopping in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "as has been shown by mller - hartmann,@xcite the @xmath39-dependence then enters only via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the lattice parameter .    due to inversion symmetry",
    ", we have    @xmath42    with @xmath43\\;\\;.\\ ] ] for a nontrivial result in the limit @xmath26 we need @xmath44 to be finite .",
    "we thus will evaluate @xmath45 directly .",
    "following again the arguments by mller - hartmann , we first rewrite @xmath46 and obtain    @xmath47    expanding the exponential in terms of @xmath48 and observing that @xmath49 and so on for terms involving @xmath50 for @xmath51 , we obtain for @xmath52 @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot \\cos\\left(q\\cdot(r_i - r_j)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -i\\delta_{|r_i - r_j|,a } \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{ds}{2\\pi}e^{ixs } s+o\\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\delta_{|r_i - r_j|,a}\\,\\frac{d}{dx}\\delta(x)\\,+o\\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)\\nonumber \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this result we find in the limit @xmath26 for the rkky exchange @xmath54 note that the right hand side of ( [ eq : rkky_final ] ) is already correctly scaled to obtain nontrivial results in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , the rkky exchange acts only on nearest neighbors , the oscillatory structures arising from fermi surface singularities in finite dimensions are absent in @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant nearest - neighbor exchange constant which through its sign determins the type of order can be obtained .    for @xmath25",
    ", the susceptibility is given by the simple bubble , which can be evaluated exactly albeit only numerically , leading to the behavior for @xmath33 depicted in fig .",
    "[ rkkystrength ] .",
    "note that the sign change from @xmath55 ( afm ) to @xmath56 ( fm ) appears for @xmath57 .",
    "we will discuss this figure in connection with numerical results in the next sections .",
    "for @xmath25 as function of the occupancy @xmath58,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for finite @xmath59 , a similar evaluation is not possible , because the susceptibility entering now is the full lattice susceptibility . while @xmath60 is the local susceptibility , which can be obtained from the effective impurity problem directly , its derivative determining @xmath33 involves neighboring @xmath61 values , which can not be calculated within nrg .",
    "we content ourselves here by noting that finite coulomb correlations typically lead to a more asymmetric distribution of spectral weight , which is known to tend to enhance ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "we thus expect that the root of @xmath33 will shift to larger values of the occupancy @xmath58 for finite @xmath21 .",
    "in this section we present our results for the magnetic phases of the extended klm ( [ model ] ) . up to now the local spin @xmath10 was completely arbitrary and can in principle take any value .",
    "although it is surely interesting to study the effect of increasing spin quantum number on the results,@xcite we restrict the discussion to the case @xmath62 here .",
    "the calculations were done for a bethe lattice employing a bipartite subdivision to accommodate antiferromagnetic order.@xcite we used a bethe lattice instead of a hypercubic one for computational reasons .",

    "these materials typically have a rich magnetic phase diagram , and it is an interesting question , how these two interactions cooperate or compete in driving different magnetic phases .",
    "a particularly interesting question in this respect is , to what extent , qualitatively and quantitatively , the concept of the rkky approximation of an effective interaction between the local spins mediated by the itinerant conduction states holds .",
    "we treat the model within dmft , using nrg as solver for the effective impurity problem .",
    "the calculations were done for a bipartite lattice , allowing for homogeneous ferromagnetism and nel antiferromagnetism . at half filling , we find an antiferromagnetic phase , as expected , for all ferromagnetic kondo couplings @xmath56 . for antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath55 , there exists a critical @xmath76 , where the system becomes a paramagnetic kondo insulator.@xcite    for @xmath74 , this antiferromagnetic phase prevails for finite doping up to a critical filling @xmath126 depending on @xmath0 and the local coulomb interaction @xmath21 . for finite @xmath21 and @xmath56 ,",
    "we in addition find phase separation between the antiferromagnetic insulator with @xmath66 and an antiferromagnetic metal with @xmath127 . for @xmath25",
    "we find no convincing evidence that such a phase separation exists , too , but the numerical results are not sufficiently clear to rule it out either . for @xmath128",
    "no antiferromagnetic phase exists at all .    below a second critical filling @xmath110 a homogeneous ferromagnet",
    "quite interestingly , the extent and stability of this phase is increased by both a finite @xmath21 and an antiferromagnetic @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this stabilization can quite likely be traced back to the introduction of a strong asymmetric redistribution of spectral weight in the electronic spectral function .",
    "an interesting aspect in connection with quantum critical points in e.g.  ferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds is that for antiferromagnetic kondo exchange a finite coulomb correlation among the conduction states has the tendency to change the order of the phase transition at @xmath110 from second order without correlation to first order with correlations .",
    "we find that for ferromagnetic kondo coupling @xmath0 the predictions by rkky can be used to at least qualitatively account for the different phases . for moderate and large @xmath55",
    ", however , rkky can not even qualitatively predict the phases correctly , underestimating the ferromagnetic phase grossly .",
    "moreover , the variations of the polarizations of the local spin and bandelectrons seem to follow rkky for very small @xmath73 , but already deviate substantially for moderate values .",
    "we want to thank helpful discussions with andreas honecker , akihisa koga and dieter vollhardt .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg through pr298/10 .",
    "computer support was provided by the gesellschaft fr wissenschaftliche datenverarbeitung in gttingen and the norddeutsche verbund fr hoch- und hchstleistungsrechnen ."
