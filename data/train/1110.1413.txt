    "networks and network theory have been utilized to represent and analyze the structure and function of a myriad of biological systems .",
    "these systems span scales from cells to ecosystems and include gene regulatory networks  @xcite , metabolic pathways  @xcite , disease dynamics  @xcite , food webs  @xcite , host - parasite webs  @xcite , and social interactions @xcite . in the process",
    ", structural archetypes have been identified including scale - free behavior , motifs , modularity , the emergence of hubs , and small - world structure  @xcite .",
    "however , these theories do not typically incorporate the spatial constraints that underlie the location and connections amongst nodes and edges .",
    "indeed , there are many examples of delivery and distribution networks where nodes and edges are physical structures embedded in space , e.g. , leaf venation networks @xcite , cardiovascular networks @xcite , cortical networks @xcite , root networks @xcite , ant trails @xcite and road networks @xcite .",
    "hence , theory is also needed to characterize biological networks whose structure is strongly influenced by physical constraints ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "although the theory of spatial networks is quite diverse , the theory as applied to resource delivery networks in biology often involves certain simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , in fractal branching theory , a network is seen as a perfectly self - similar structure , e.g. a dividing binary tree @xcite .",
    "a prominent theory of metabolic scaling in mammals assumes the cardiovascular system is a fractal whose physical dimensions have evolved to optimally transport fluid from the aorta to capillaries @xcite .",
    "an extension of this model to the above - ground structure of tree branches makes similar assumptions @xcite .",
    "both models have inspired a wide array of follow - up work with increased recognition that the original fractal branching assumption is overly simplistic @xcite .",
    "for example , in reality , physical networks in biology have side branches and are not perfectly balanced binary trees @xcite . theories of side - branching resource delivery and distribution networks have their origins in the study of river networks . in a river network",
    ", streams merge together to form larger streams .",
    "however , small streams can merge into larger streams of all scales .",
    "the topological structure of river networks can be analyzed using the so - called horton - strahler order @xcite .",
    "this scheme assigns an integer number to every branch of the network .",
    "the numbers represent different levels of the branch hierarchy , with larger numbers corresponding to the larger stream segments in the network .",
    "the horton - strahler ordering is the basis for the characterization of the statistical properties of river networks@xcite , including the finding that river networks are fractal @xcite .",
    "moreover , the side - branching statistics first introduced by tokunaga @xcite can be used to characterize universal features of river networks and departures thereof @xcite .",
    "leaf venation networks are a prominent example of a physical delivery and distribution network whose structure possess numerous side branches .",
    "the structure of leaf venation networks has broad functional implications .",
    "for example , leaf vein density is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates  @xcite and also influences the extent to which leaves form a hydraulic bottleneck in whole plants  @xcite .",
    "however , many leaves of higher plants ( notably most leaves of angiosperm lineages ) , have reticulate venation networks , involving loops within loops @xcite .",
    "it has been hypothesized that reticulate patterns allow leaves to maintain the supply of water and nutrients to and from photosynthetically active chloroplasts even when flow through some edges in the network is lost  @xcite due to mechanical damage or herbivory .",
    "unfortunately , the horton - strahler ordering scheme developed for the analysis of river networks is not directly applicable to reticular networks .",
    "the reason is that loops lead to inconsistencies in the merging procedure in which a strictly hierarchical order is assigned to all edges . in this paper",
    "we propose a method that generalizes the horton - strahler order to planar , weighted reticular networks . such networks encompass a large class of physical networks , where weights can often be obtained by estimating dimensions of edges , such as branch widths , or other indicators of cost or importance . while coinciding with the horton - strahler order for branching networks , our method also assigns hierarchical levels to the loops of the network .",
    "moreover , it categorizes the branches into the ones responsible for the formation of loops , and the ones forming the tree structure of the network .",
    "edge weights play an important role in our algorithm , and we perform a theoretical analysis of possible effects of weight perturbations on the hierarchical levels .",
    "we find that the loop hierarchy is more robust to measurement error of network edge weights than is the tree hierarchy . in the past ,",
    "comparisons of the statistical similarity between river networks and leaves have been proposed , albeit such comparisons are restricted to leaves without loops  @xcite .",
    "hence , we also discuss applications of the current method to the characterization and comparison of reticulate leaf venation networks as well as obstacles to extending this method to a more general class of networks .",
    "we start by reviewing the algorithm for constructing the horton - strahler order . for the remainder of the paper",
    ", we shall adopt the language of graph theory @xcite .",
    "note that in graph theory , the `` leaves '' of the network are those vertices which only have a single edge that connects to them . in this context ,",
    "the input to the horton - strahler ordering algorithm is simply a rooted tree , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of vertices and @xmath2 is the set of edges .",
    "given such a tree , the algorithm assigns a level , @xmath3 , to each edge @xmath4 in the following way :    * assign level @xmath5 to all edges connected to the leaves of @xmath6 . * for each vertex having only one incident edge , @xmath7 , with undefined @xmath3 , let @xmath8 be the maximal level among the other incident edges . if there is a single incident edge of level @xmath8 , then @xmath9 . if there are two or more incident edges of level @xmath8 , then @xmath10 .",
    "the result of this algorithm is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : strahler](a ) .",
    "conventionally in the study of river networks  @xcite , this algorithm can be summarized by a single rule which states that the order of a downstream segment is equal to @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the order of the two upstream segments that are merging and @xmath14 is the kronecker delta .",
    "it is clear , however , that if the network has loops , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : strahler](b ) , the algorithm simply can not proceed because there always will be a vertex having more than one incident edge with an undefined level .",
    "moreover , loops in this graph seem to also form a hierarchy .",

    "[ fig : strahler](b ) by the red dotted line may belong to a higher level than the loop outlined by the blue dashed line .",

    "let us assume that the weight function is strictly increasing with respect to this order , that is , @xmath20 if @xmath21 . in this case , the horton - strahler order can be computed using the following procedure :    * let @xmath22 be the set of edges incident to leaves of @xmath6 , regarded as a set of disjoint components . for each @xmath23 let @xmath24 .",

    "the assignment of levels in this tree follows the original horton - strahler algorithm .",
    "it is also useful to remember that faces of @xmath40 are vertices of its dual graph , @xmath58 , and merging faces of @xmath40 can be thought of as adding an edge to @xmath58 .",

    "clearly , edge weights play an important role in the construction of both loop and tree hierarchies .",
    "unfortunately , weight estimation done in practice is often imprecise , so the order in which the algorithm iterates through the edges may be perturbed . in this section",
    "we investigate how such a perturbation affects the loop and tree hierarchies .",
    "we start by considering the worst possible change in the hierarchical levels of loops .",
    "notice that the highest level in the hierarchy of loops can be as low as @xmath55 .",
    "this happens when the first reticular edge creates a level @xmath55 face and every other reticular edge merges a level @xmath5 face with the only level @xmath55 face ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : worst_case](a ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the highest level in the loop hierarchy can be as high as @xmath73 , where @xmath68 is the number of faces .",
    "this happens when level @xmath5 faces are merged only with level @xmath5 faces until only faces of level @xmath55 are left , then level @xmath55 faces are merged with level @xmath55 faces until only faces of level @xmath56 are left , and so on ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : worst_case](b ) ) .",
    "it is clear from the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : worst_case ] that there is a permutation of edges that can change the loop hierarchy from one of the extreme cases to the other .",
    "however , in practice such a permutation would generally result in from a significant perturbation in weights . for small perturbations ,",
    "it is more likely that only a few transpositions of edges will occur .",
    "let @xmath74 be the order of edges with respect to their weights .",
    "we shall now analyze how the structure of @xmath60 and @xmath59 changes when a single transposition occurs , that is , when the order of @xmath46 and @xmath75 is swapped .",
    "first , we notice that there will be no changes to the structure of the co - tree or the spanning tree if @xmath46 and @xmath75 are both tree edges , or if @xmath46 is a tree edge and @xmath75 is a reticular edge . hence , there are two cases to consider : when both @xmath46 and @xmath75 are reticular , and when @xmath46 is a reticular edge and @xmath75 is a tree edge . in the former case , we can regard reticular edges as edges of the co - tree .",
    "we see then that swapping the two edges may shift a subtree of the co - tree only one level up or down .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that hierarchical levels of loops will change at most by one .",
    "the case of a reticular edge and a tree edge is more complicated .",
    "such a transposition may lead to detaching a subtree of the remaining spanning tree and attaching it at a different place .",

    "suppose that @xmath86 ( the case when @xmath87 follows the same argument ) . then @xmath75 is adjacent to either @xmath77 or @xmath76 ; let us assume it s @xmath76 . removing @xmath75 before @xmath46 leads to merging @xmath78 with @xmath76 first , and then merging the resulting face with @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding change in the tree structure , shown in fig [ fig : case_1 ] , is a single rotation around @xmath85 .",
    "possible changes in the levels of the nodes involved in the rotation are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : case_1 ] .",

    "we have shown that the hierarchy of loops often observed in reticular physical networks can be defined explicitly using a generalization of the horton - strahler order . to obtain such a generalization we regard the network as a weighted graph , with weights corresponding to the widths of the network branches . noticing that the horton - strahler order can be computed by analyzing how specific disjoint components ( sub - networks ) of a ( non - reticular ) network are merged as the edges are _ added _ in the order of increasing weight",

    "recent innovations in software now permit semi - automated extraction of the dimension and connectivity of entire leaf vein networks and the areoles that veins surround  @xcite .",
    "hence , greater quantification of leaf vein networks from across a wide range of biological diversity will soon be available for which to analyze leaf development , variation across environmental gradients and in paleobotanical studies .",

    ". the current study will provide additional metrics to compare the detailed branching structure of reticulate networks .    an important caveat to keep in mind when comparing reticulate network structure",
    "is that estimating weights in physical networks is by no means a trivial problem .",
    "therefore , we have performed a theoretical analysis of possible changes in the loop and tree hierarchies due to perturbations in edge weights .",
    "we have shown that the worst possible change in the loop hierarchy is attainable , but requires a significant perturbation of weights .",
    "taking into account that small perturbations are likely to cause only a few transpositions in the order in which the edges are removed , we have shown that a single such transposition can change the hierarchical levels of loops at most by one .",
    "we have also shown that the change in the hierarchical levels of the remaining spanning tree can be arbitrarily large even when a single transposition is performed .",
    "it is important to note that in either case the change does not happen for every transposition .",
    "rather , the transposed edges have to satisfy a particular condition , which may happen rarely in practice .",
    "the latter claim is supported by the numerous successful applications of the horton - strahler order .",
    "while the method itself does not depend on any weights , the connectivity of the network is obtained by analyzing digital elevation map which contain noise  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the difference between the correct and the computed connectivity may be exactly the same as the difference in the connectivity of our spanning tree caused by transposing two edges .",
    "hence , the resulting hierarchy may be drastically different from the correct one .",
    "nevertheless , the horton - strahler order has been successfully used for over five decades despite the potential instability identified here@xcite .",
    "we suggest that empirical characterizations of reticulate planar networks include randomization analysis on edge weights to identify the robustness of claims regarding statistical structure of side - branching of the tree and co - tree .",
    "many biological and physical systems are represented by non - planar physical networks  @xcite and computing hierarchical levels of loops in such networks is still an open question .",
    "while our method can be applied to obtain the tree hierarchy of such networks , the loop hierarchy can not be computed in this case because the algorithm relies on the fact that any loop in a planar network corresponds to a union of faces . in the mathematical language ,",
    "( boundaries of ) faces of a planar graph form a canonical basis for loops ( @xmath5-dimensional homology classes ) .",
    "such a canonical basis is not present in non - planar graphs .",

    "perhaps a method for computing loop hierarchies which is not based on the widths of the network branches could provide an answer .",

    "<S> the structure of hierarchical networks in biological and physical systems has long been characterized using the horton - strahler ordering scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme assigns an integer order to each edge in the network based on the topology of branching such that the order increases from distal parts of the network ( e.g. , mountain streams or capillaries ) to the `` root '' of the network ( e.g. , the river outlet or the aorta ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , horton - strahler ordering can not be applied to networks with loops because they they create a contradiction in the edge ordering in terms of which edge precedes another in the hierarchy . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a generalization of the horton - strahler order to weighted planar reticular networks , where weights are assumed to correlate with the importance of network edges , e.g. , weights estimated from edge widths may correlate to flow capacity . </S>",
    "<S> our method assigns hierarchical levels not only to edges of the network , but also to its loops , and classifies the edges into reticular edges , which are responsible for loop formation , and tree edges . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we perform a detailed and rigorous theoretical analysis of the sensitivity of the hierarchical levels to weight perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss applications of this generalized horton - strahler ordering to the study of leaf venation and other biological networks . </S>"
