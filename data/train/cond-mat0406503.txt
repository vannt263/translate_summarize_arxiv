    "since the pioneering works on the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite of alkali - atoms , a great variety of experimental and theoretical investigations have probed the macroscopic phase coherence of confined quantum gases . for a trapped 3d bec well below the transition temperature @xmath0 , experiments have confirmed the macroscopic phase coherence by measuring the correlation length which is equal to the condensate size @xcite .",
    "however , the phase coherence strongly depends on the shape of the confining potential which can be control at will .",
    "it was theoretically proposed that the axial phase fluctuations of an elongated 3d bec can be very large in the equilibrium state , where the density fluctuations are strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the axial phase coherence length in the elongated systems can be smaller than the axial size and this is referred as the quasi - condensates .",
    "similarly , quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field regime @xcite forms a quasi - condensate @xcite with a large phase fluctuations even at temperatures as low as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the quasi-1d bose gas behaves like a hard - core bosons ( commonly known as tonks - girardeau gas ) @xcite when the strength of the two - body potential is very strong which has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the hard - core bosonic systems have a very strong vacuum phase fluctuations which prevents from being a ( quasi-)condensate even at @xmath2 and mimicking the exclusion principle for fermions .",
    "the most striking features of the phase fluctuating 3d bec is that the stripes formation in the axial density profile of the system @xcite .",
    "the celebrated hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) experiment @xcite in which the spatial second - order correlation function @xmath3 of a light source is characterized by measuring the correlations of intensity fluctuations in the wave field . the original idea of the hbt experiment is that by measuring the intensity correlations between two separated beams , they essentially compared the intensities at two different points in the unseperated beam @xcite .",
    "the equal - times second - order correlation function provides information on the relative spatial distribution of pairs of identical particles .",
    "therefore , the stripes formation can be understand by analyzing the second - order correlation function if it shows oscillatory behavior .    in this letter",
    ", we understand the experimental observations of the stripes formation in the axial density profile of a phase fluctuating 3d bec by means of the axial two - particle correlation functions .",
    "next , we propose that the same stripes formation in the axial density profile can be observed in quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field as well as in the hard - core bosons regimes .",
    "we also discuss how to realize the stripes formation by a suitable choices of the bragg pulse in the bragg interferometer which is similar to the hbt experiment .",
    "_ two - point correlation function : _ we consider a 3d bec confined in an elongated harmonic trap , where the repulsive mean - field interaction energy exceeds the radial @xmath4 and the axial @xmath5 trap energies . at @xmath2 , the density profile has the well - known form @xmath6 , where @xmath7^{2/5}$ ] is the zero - temperature chemical potential , and @xmath8 is the two - body interaction strength .",
    "also , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radial and the axial size of the condensate , respectively . due to the repulsive mean - field energy , density fluctuations",
    "are strongly suppressed in a trapped bec .",
    "therefore , the bosonic field operator describing the condensate can be written in the form @xmath11 $ ] , where the phase operator @xmath12 is defined as [ phase ] ( * r*,t ) = _ _ ( * r * ) e^-i _ t _ + h.c . here , @xmath13 is the annihilation operator of the quasiparticle excitation with quantum numbers @xmath14 and energy @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the corresponding quasiparticles normalized wave functions .",
    "the normalized two - particle correlation function is defined as c_2[\\{*r*_i } ] & = & _ i=1 ^ 4 [ ] ^-1 < ^ ( * r*_1 ) ^ ( * r*_2 ) ( * r*_3 ) ( * r*_4 ) > + & = & e^- < [ ( * r*_1 ) + ( * r*_2 ) - ( * r*_3 ) - ( * r*_4)]^2 > = e^- f(\\ { * r*_i } ) . due to the strong suppression of the density fluctuations , the normalized density correlation function of the trapped condensate is constant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 . therefore",
    ", a simple measurement of the density correlations in the condensate is not enough to describe coherence properties .",
    "however , by measuring the density correlations in the interference pattern generated by two spatially displaced copies of a parent bec , it is possible to correlate the bosonic field operator @xmath18 at four different positions and extract the @xmath19 @xcite .    _",

    "@xcite , the 3d condensate consists of @xmath20 atoms of @xmath21rb .",
    "the radial and axial trapping frequencies are @xmath22 hz and @xmath23 hz ( @xmath24 ) , respectively .",
    "the condensate is already elongated along the longitudinal @xmath25 axis due to the aspect ratio @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , further radial compression or expansion of the condensate are obtained by applying the superimposed blue detuned optical dipole trap to the magnetic trap . in the experiment @xcite",
    ", they performed the measurements for the radial trapping frequencies @xmath27 between @xmath28 hz and @xmath29 hz corresponding to aspect ratios @xmath30 between 9.8 and 51 , respectively .",
    "the excitations of a cigar - shaped bec can be divided into two regimes :  low - energy \" axial excitations with energy @xmath31 , and  high - energy \" radial excitations with @xmath32 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the low - energy axial excitations have wave - lengths larger than @xmath33 and exhibit a pronounced 1d behavior which gives the most important contribution to the low - energy axial phase fluctuations .",
    "the low - energy axial modes have the energy spectrum @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the normalized wave functions @xmath35 of these quasiparticle modes have the form _ j(*r * ) = p_j^(1,1)(z ) , where @xmath36 are jacobi polynomials and @xmath37 is a dimensionless variable .    using eq .",

    "the upper cut - off limit ( @xmath39 ) on the summation can be obtained from the constraint : @xmath40 .",
    "it is useful to define the space variables in the following way : @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 is the displacement between the two interfering condensate copies and @xmath44 is the relative distance between the positions in the interference pattern at which the particle densities are evaluated",
    "this new choice of variables has been realized in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the axial two - particle correlation function at zero temperature has oscillatory behavior with very small amplitude .",
    "it shows little evidence of the stripes formation even at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we do not claim that stripes are present even at @xmath46 because it is almost one for a large separation .",
    "the minima of the @xmath47 at various relative separations are decreasing with the increasing of the aspect ratio @xmath48 .",
    "it implies that vacuum phase fluctuation increases with the aspect ratio .",
    "fig.2 shows the oscillatory behavior with large amplitudes compared to the zero temperature case .",
    "these prominent deep valleys implies the presence of stripes in the axial density distribution due to the strong thermally excited phase fluctuations and the large aspect ratio @xmath48 .",
    "the minima of the @xmath49 at various relative separations are decreasing with the increasing of the temperature and the aspect ratio @xmath48 .    in the actual experiment @xcite ,",
    "the stripes formation is observed after the ballistic expansion of the atomic cloud .",
    "however , it does not rule out the possibility of the stripes formation in static bec _",
    "i.e. _ , without ballistic expansion . according to the ref .",
    "@xcite , the observation of the stripes formation after the ballistic expansion of the cloud is due to the rapidly decreasing of the mean - field interaction and the axial velocity fields are then converted into the density distribution . in our studies",
    "we find that the stripes formation in the axial density profile is already present even before switching off the trap .",
    "therefore , the stripes formation are not necessarily due to the axial velocity fields which are converted into density modulations during the ballistic expansion , as stated in ref .",
    "the width of the stripes are too small to be observed directly in - trap due to the lack of the experimental resolution , but it is seen after expansion of the cloud since the stripes in the static cloud is enlarged during the ballistic expansion of the cloud .    _",
    "quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field regime _ : now we consider quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field regime as described in ref .",
    "in particular , the system consists of @xmath50 atoms of @xmath51 na in the trap with axial trapping frequency @xmath52 hz , and radial trapping frequency @xmath53 hz . the low - energy excitation spectrum is given by @xmath54 and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are @xmath55 , @xcite where @xmath56 is the legendre polynomial in @xmath25 and @xmath57 is the thomas - fermi half length .",

    "similar to the 3d bec in very elongated traps , the vacuum phase fluctuations are not able to produce the stripes in quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field regime , however , at large temperature , the two - point correlation functions have prominent oscillatory behavior with large amplitudes , compared to the zero temperature case .",

    "note that fig.5 is valid only when @xmath66 due to the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "this hydrodynamic approximation is failed to describe the short - range correlations due to the strong interactions when @xmath67 .",
    "5 shows that the two - point correlation functions have the oscillatory behavior with large amplitude even at zero temperature .",
    "this implies that stripes are already present in the hard - core bosons regime even at zero temperature due to the strong quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "note that the amplitude of the oscillations in the zero temperature two - point correlation functions is very very small in the cigar - shaped 3d bec as well as in the quasi-1d bose gas in the mean field regime , compared to the quasi-1d bose gas in the hard - core regime .",

    "@xcite to measure the two - particle correlation function is analogous to the original hbt experiment @xcite .",

    "@xcite with a proper choices of the wave vector @xmath68 and the time interval ( @xmath69 ) between the two bragg pulses such that the distances ( @xmath70 ) between two auto correlated copies should be @xmath71 .",
    "we have checked that for other choices of @xmath43 , @xmath72 , the oscillatory behavior in the two - point correlation functions washes out .",
    "this is due to the fact that the two interfering matter waves are not hbt - correlated when @xmath72 .",
    "here we mean hbt - correlated in a sense that the matter waves will produce an hbt effect at the output ports , as opposed to the different question of the correlations in the parent condensate @xcite .",
    "in fact , the two matter waves are hbt - correlated only if they are interfering within a coherence time ( @xmath73 ) , the characteristic time scale in the experiment . the relative distance @xmath43 between two interfering becs at the output ports of the interferometer can be controlled by varying the time interval ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "when @xmath74 is small such that @xmath75 , we expect the correlations to be maximal and shows the hbt effect . for large @xmath76 ,",
    "the distance between two interfering becs is large so that it becomes hbt - uncorrelated and then it does not produce valleys in the interference patterns . the time interval , @xmath69 , before colliding two copies should be less than the coherence time @xmath73 which is inversely proportional to the temperature of the condensate _",

    "we have also predicted that the stripes are present in the quasi-1d bose gas in the mean - field regime at large temperature as well as in the 1d hard - core bosonic systems even at zero temperature due to to the strong quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "we have also pointed out that one can realize the stripes by a proper choices of the parameters in the bragg interferometer experiment which is similar to the hbt setup .",
