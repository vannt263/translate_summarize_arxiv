    "<S> the results for fidelity timescales , obtained for a large range of error amplitudes and number of qubits , imply that for static imperfections the threshold for fault - tolerant quantum computation is decreased by a few orders of magnitude compared to the case of random errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical theory of wavelet transforms ( wt ) finds nowadays an enormous success in various fields of science and technology , including treatment of large databases , data and image compression , signal processing , telecommunications and many other applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> wavelets are obtained by translations and dilations of an original function and they allow to obtain high resolutions of microscopic details , both in frequency and space </S>",
    "<S> . the discrete wt can be implemented with high computational efficiency and provide a powerful tool for treatment of digital data . </S>",
    "<S> it is well accepted that the fourier transform and wt are the main instruments for data treatment , and it has been shown that in many applications the performance of wt is much higher compared to the fourier analysis . the permanent growth of computer capacity has significantly increased the importance of the above transformations in numerical applications .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent development of quantum information processing has shown that computers based on laws of quantum mechanics can perform certain tasks exponentially faster than any known classical computational algorithms ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most known example is the integer factorization algorithm proposed by shor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an essential element of this algorithm is the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) which can be performed for a vector of size @xmath0 in @xmath1 quantum gates , in contrast to @xmath2 classical operations @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 can be viewed as the number of qubits ( two - level quantum systems ) of which a quantum computer is built . </S>",
    "<S> apart from shor s algorithm , the qft finds a number of various applications in quantum computation , including the simulation of quantum chaos models showing rich and complex dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the qft to imperfections was tested in numerical simulations and the time - scales for reliable computation of the algorithm were established @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a few years after the discovery of the qft algorithm , it has been shown that certain wt can also be implemented on a quantum computer in a polynomial number of quantum gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , explicit quantum circuits were developed for the most popular discrete wt , namely the 4-coefficient daubechies wt ( @xmath4 ) and the haar wt , both for pyramidal and packet algorithms @xcite . as it happens in classical signal analysis , it is natural to expect that qwt will find important future applications for the treatment of quantum databases and quantum data compression . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is important to investigate the stability and the accuracy of qwt in respect to imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially important since the functions of the wavelet basis have singularities in the derivatives ( in contrast to analyticity of fourier waves ) that may enhance the effects of perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> to this aim we introduce a simple model with rich nontrivial dynamics which is essentially based on multiple applications of the wt . </S>",
    "<S> its quantum evolution can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer , and it is described by the unitary map for the wave function @xmath5 : @xmath6 here the bar marks the value of the wave function after one map iteration , @xmath7 is the @xmath4 wt operator , and the unitary diagonal operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent quantum phase rotation in computational and wavelet basis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution takes place in the hilbert space of @xmath0 states , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the index in the wavelet basis and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are dimensionless parameters . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is replaced by the fourier transform , one obtains the quantum sawtooth map previously analyzed in ref.@xcite . thus the model ( [ model ] ) can be considered as a kicked wavelet rotor , where @xmath14 is the kick strength in the wavelet basis . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically tested that the dynamical properties are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath13 and here we present data for a typical value @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the global properties of the evolution operator ( [ model ] ) are shown in figs.[fig1],[fig2 ] for different values of @xmath14 ( see also appendix a1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> this decay law for the matrix elements can be considered as a long range coupling between states . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar power law regimes have been analyzed in random matrix models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical analysis shows that there are two regimes for the level spacing statistics @xmath22 @xcite in the limit of large @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> the implementation of the wavelet kernel @xmath34 requires @xmath32 multi - controlled gates ( @xmath35 ) , and since the qwt is composed of @xmath36 kernel applications this leads the total number of elementary gates to scale as @xmath37 @xcite ( see appendix a3 ) . to study the algorithm accuracy we consider two models of imperfections . in the model of random noisy gates </S>",
    "<S> we replace all ideal gates by imperfect ones , which are obtained by random unitary rotations by a small angle @xmath38 , @xmath39 , around the ideal rotation angle ( as in @xcite ) . in the model of static imperfections ( see @xcite ) all gates are perfect but between gates @xmath5 accumulates a phase factor @xmath40 with @xmath41 . here @xmath42 vary randomly with @xmath43 , @xmath44 represents static one - qubit energy shifts , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 represents static inter - qubit couplings on a circular chain , @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 in = 2.6 in -0.5 cm    the numerical simulations of the ideal quantum algorithm for the map ( @xmath48 ) show that the wave function is essentially localized on a few states of the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> this localization is clearly seen from the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) @xmath49 which is a standard quantity to characterize localization in mesoscopic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it directly provides the number of sites on which the probability is concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly the localization is present not only for moderate @xmath50 , but also when the kick strength is very large @xmath51 ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> indeed in both cases @xmath52 fluctuates near a constant value @xmath53 , even for a very large number of iterations . </S>",

    "<S> is spread over the whole basis ( data not shown ) , but only a moderate number of narrow peaks contributes to the ipr value ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath52 shows modified bounded oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution in fig.[fig4 ] shows the appearance of a plateau with pronounced peaks located approximately at @xmath59 , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the appearance of these peaks to the pyramidal structure of the algorithm , which in the presence of imperfections produces stronger errors at the above values of @xmath31 . for static imperfections </S>",
    "<S> the plateau level remains bounded in time @xmath58 while for noisy gates it increases with @xmath58 and for very large @xmath58 the probability becomes homogeneously distributed over the computational basis .    </S>",

    "<S> our numerical data are presented in fig.[fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> they show that for noisy gates @xmath65 is described by the relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of gates per map iteration , @xmath69 is the total number of gates and @xmath70 is a numerical constant . </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin for this scaling is related to the fact that after each gate an amount of probability of the order of @xmath71 is transferred from the ideal state to all other states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an exponential decay of the fidelity @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a constant ( see fig.[fig5]a ) . </S>",

    "<S> this timescale is significantly smaller than the one for noisy gates . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this happens due to the coherent action of static imperfections , which lead to effective rabi oscillations proportional to @xmath80 for each qubit . for @xmath3 qubits </S>",
