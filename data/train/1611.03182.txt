    "the icecube telescope has detected tev - pev neutrinos from extraterrestrial sources for the first time @xcite , which open a new window to explore the high - energy universe .",
    "the explanation of a single atmospheric origin of these high - energy neutrino events collected during 4 years has been strongly disfavored at around @xmath2 level of confidence @xcite .",
    "the best fit result for the high energy astrophysical neutrino flux reaches a level of @xmath3 gev @xmath4 s@xmath5 sr@xmath5 per flavor between around 60 tev and 2 pev , and the spectral index of the power law model is @xmath6 @xcite .    the astrophysical neutrinos have shown no significantly directional clustering @xcite . they also show no clear association with any known classes of astrophysical sources so far .",
    "high - energy neutrino emission results from the decays of charged pions produced in the interaction between relativistic protons and ambient gas ( @xmath7 ) or ambient radiation ( @xmath8 ) , and the same processes inevitably produce high - energy gamma - ray photons via the neutral pion decays .",
    "although very high - energy photons above , e.g. 100 gev , may be absorbed in the source or during the propagation in the intergalactic space , gev photons could escape and arrive at the earth accompanying neutrinos .",
    "the potential astrophysical sources to produce high - energy neutrinos and photons include star - forming galaxies @xcite , tidal disruption events @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs)@xcite , active galactic nucleus ( agns)@xcite , double white dwarf mergers @xcite and even galactic sources @xcite , see @xcite for a review . however , combined data analysis between icecube neutrinos events and @xmath9-ray sources sample , such as grbs , agns , soft @xmath9-ray repeaters , supernova remnants , pulsars , microquasars , and x - ray binaries , do not reveal any clear associations up to now .",
    "recently @xcite find that a cascade pev neutrino event occurs in positional and temporal coincidence with a giant gamma - ray flare of the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) pks b1424 - 418 , with a chance probability of @xmath10 for such coincidence ( i.e. , a 2@xmath11 confidence level correlation ) .",
    "this cascade neutrino has an angular error of about @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to cascade - like events , the median angular resolution of muon track events are much better ( @xmath13 ) , and hence they are good candidates to search for the electromagnetic counterparts . @xcite",
    "have performed the search for the gamma - ray counterparts of the first 7 icecube track - like neutrinos ( @xmath14 tev ) using 70-month _ fermi_-lat data , and no steady @xmath1-ray counterparts are found .",
    "for the purpose of examining whether short - term transient sources like pks b1424 - 418 are associated with neutrinos , we here search for possible transient gamma - ray counterparts ( on timescale as short as hours ) of 12 track - like events observed by icecube up to august 6 , 2016 @xcite .",
    "we selected neutrinos with energy larger than 60 tev to reduce the contamination from the atmospheric background @xcite .",
    "this analysis is rather than cross - correlating with known catalogs , but uses the _",
    "fermi_-lat survey data to search for new @xmath9-ray transients related with the icecube track - like events or flux variability of known @xmath9-ray sources .",
    "different from @xcite , our work aims to find possible short - term or prompt gev emission associated with neutrinos , such as x - ray transients or agn gamma - ray flares , which could be missed in the 70-month long timescale analysis similar to @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the search results with the _",
    "fermi_-lat observations , the result for the search of _ swift _ hard x - ray transient sources is described in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the implication of the non - detection of gamma - ray transients for constraining the source number density .",
    "finally we give the conclusions and discussions in section 5 .",
    "the newly released _ fermi_-lat @xcite pass 8 source data ( p8r2 version 6 ) and _ fermi _ science tools version v10r0p5 are used in the present work .",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis is performed on a region of interest ( roi ) with a radius @xmath15 centered on the right ascension and declination of the each icecube track - like neutrino .",
    "all front+back converting photons with energies between 0.2 - 100 gev are taken into consideration .",
    "we apply the maximum zenith - angle cut @xmath16 to eliminate the earth s limb emission .",
    "the expression of ( data_qual @xmath17 ) & ( lat_config = = 1 ) & abs(rock_angle)@xmath18 is used to further filter the data .",
    "a source model is generated containing the position and spectral definition for all the point sources and diffuse emission from the 3fgl @xcite within @xmath19 of the roi center .",
    "the galactic and extragalactic diffuse models are gll_iem_v06.fits and iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt , respectively .",
    "we add a point source with power - law spectrum ( @xmath20 ) on each track - like neutrino position in the source model file .",
    "since we pay attention to the short - term behavior of @xmath9-ray emission on timescales of hours or months , the spectral indices of all point sources in the source model file are fixed to their 3fgl catalogue values to solve convergence problems .",
    "the normalization factors of point sources , the extragalactic diffuse emission , and the galactic diffuse emission are left free to vary .",
    "after each successful fit , test - statistic ( ts ) map for a @xmath21 region centered on the neutrino position is created to check if there is any excess @xmath9-ray emission above the background beyond the 3fgl catalog .",
    "all the upper limit flux is reported at @xmath22 confidence level with fixed spectral index @xmath23 .",
    "we have tested that assuming different spectral indices would result in a slight but insignificant difference .",
    "we first perform the data analysis over @xmath24 hours , i.e. 6 hours before and 6 hour after the neutrino detection time , to search for possibly prompt gev emission accompanying these neutrinos .",
    "no significant gamma - ray emissions on the position of the track - like neutrino events are found , and thus their upper limit fluxes are obtained , see table [ lcdata ] and figure [ lc8tfig ] .",
    "there is no new @xmath9-ray source around the region of the neutrino position identified by checking the ts map . for comparison ,",
    "the _ fermi_-lat data analysis for the gamma - ray flaring blazar pks b1424 - 418 in a similar time period is also carried out and the result is presented in table [ lcdata ] and figure [ lc8tfig ] . for the same period of time ,",
    "pks b1424 - 418 shows bright emission with detection significance of @xmath25 , and the corresponding energy flux is @xmath26 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( @xmath27 gev ) . as we can see in figure [ lc8tfig ] , the upper limit fluxes of any possible point sources associated with track - like neutrinos are significantly below the flux of the pks b 1424 - 418 emission .",
    "what s more , all the 3fgl sources within the @xmath28 angular error of track - like neutrinos would be too weak to be detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat for twelve - hour observations",
    "( here @xmath29 means angular error at 50% confidence level ) .    as some blazars outbursts occur on timescale of months , we further choose one year for the time window to search for gamma - ray flares similar to that in pks b1424 - 418 .",
    "the likelihood analysis of _ fermi_-lat data of each track - like neutrino event is conducted , which also yields a null result . the upper limit fluxes covering the period of half year before and half year after the neutrino trigger time are given in table [ lcdata ] and also shown in figure [ lc1yrfig ] .",
    "for comparison , we also show the energy flux of pks b1424 - 418 in the similar time interval , which is @xmath30 erg @xmath31 s@xmath5 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the upper limit gamma - ray fluxes for the track - like neutrinos are far below the flux of pks b1424 - 418 .",
    "we note that neutrino event number 5 has a known 3fgl @xmath9-ray source j0725.8 - 0054 ( bl lac object pks 0723 - 008 ) located @xmath33 from neutrino s position .",
    "another 3fgl @xmath9-ray source j2227.8 + 0040 ( bl lac object pmn j2227 + 0037 ) is located @xmath34 from neutrino event number 44 .",
    "the two sources are detected at @xmath35 and @xmath36 in one year observation respectively , with fluxes two orders of magnitude lower than that of pks b1424 - 418 . while these two 3fgl sources appear to have a hard spectral index , there is no evidence that they are tev gamma - ray sources ( http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/ )",
    "moreover , when a spatial error of @xmath28 is considered , additional 9 3fgl sources , most of which are blazars , are in positional agreement with the these track - like neutrino events ( see table [ fgldata ] for more details ) .",
    "their gamma - ray fluxes are , however , too low to account for the observed neutrino flux , in contrast with pks b1424 - 418 .",
    "we calculate the significance of the spatial coincidence of 3fgl sources with the icecube track - like neutrinos , running 10000 simulations in which the declination and the right ascension of each 3fgl sample are randomized . for each simulation , we obtain a count number @xmath37 of 3fgl sources within @xmath38 of our track - like neutrino sample .",
    "the chance probability is calculated as the ratio between the number of the simulations that have @xmath39 and the total number of simulations .",
    "this approach results in a chance probability @xmath40 , suggests that the coincidence between two 3fgl sources , j0725.8 - 0054 ( pks 0723 - 008 ) and j2227.8 + 0040 ( pmn j2227 + 0037 ) , and track - like neutrinos is merely by chance .",
    "if the declination is fixed and the right ascension is randomized only , the chance probability of such spatial coincidence reaches @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore find no evidence of gamma - ray emission associated with icecube track - like neutrino events .",
    "considering the @xmath1-ray flux limits for one year _",
    "fermi_-lat observation , we suggest that any gamma - ray flares that are associated with icecube track - like neutrino events must be at least one order of magnitude dimmer than that of pks b1424 - 418 ( see figure [ lc1yrfig ] ) .",
    "we note that three icecube track - like neutrino events , e.g. number 23 , 45 and 160806a , locate at small angle ( @xmath42 ) from _ fermi_-lat boresight at the neutrino detection time . in other words ,",
    "the region around the track - like neutrino events is within the _ fermi_-lat field of view during the @xmath43s before and after the neutrino detection .",
    "therefore the above three neutrinos are very suitable for searching for the prompt gev emission accompanying the neutrino emission .",
    "the angular distance between neutrino position and _ fermi_-lat boresight ( denoted as @xmath44 ) versus time is shown in figure [ boresight ] .",
    "the time intervals for _ fermi_-lat data analysis are selected with the criterion @xmath45 , which are also presented in table [ lcondata ] .",
    "no new @xmath46-ray point sources are found within @xmath28 of the neutrinos .",
    "for the neutrino event number 23 , there are four 3fgl sources within @xmath28 , while for the other two neutrinos , there are no sources within @xmath28 .",
    "all the four 3fgl sources within @xmath28 are two weak , and none of them shows any significant emission over @xmath47 s of _ fermi_-lat observations .",
    "the likelihood analysis centered on each neutrino position results in upper limit fluxes given in table [ lcondata ] . in brief , we find no evidence of prompt gev emissions following the icecube track - like neutrino events .",
    "_ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) is very useful for discovering new x - ray transient sources or detecting the flux variability of known x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the high - energy photons from pion decay could be accompanied by x - ray emissions that are produced by secondary electrons and positrons via , e.g. synchrotron radiation in the magnetic fields of the source @xcite .",
    "we thus make a cross - correlation analysis between _ swift_/bat transient sources catalog and icecube track - like neutrino events .",
    "the catalog includes 1009 x - ray transient sources ( see http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/ ) , including galactic and extragalactic sources . none _",
    "swift_/bat transient source is found inside the error box @xmath38 of the icecube track - like neutrino events . within @xmath28 ,",
    "swift_/bat transient sources are in positional agreement with the icecube track - like neutrino events number 23 , 37 , 44 and 47 ( see table [ bat4sources ] ) .",
    "to investigate their temporal characteristics around the time that the corresponding neutrino events are detected , we extract the day - bin light curves for these x - ray sources .",
    "no significant flares are observed at the neutrino detection time for the five x - ray transient sources , as shown in figure [ battransient ] .",
    "similarly , a chance probability of @xmath48 for the coincidence is estimated using monte carlo simulations with the sample data randomized in right ascension .",
    "therefore , considering the insignificant spatial coincidence and the observed temporal behavior of the x - ray transients , we suggest that these _ swift_/bat transient sources are not in physical association with the icecube track - like neutrino events .",
    "the production of neutrinos are accompanied by high - energy gamma - rays . for @xmath7 collision mechanism of tev - pev neutrinos",
    ", one expect that gev gamma - ray flux lies at the power - law extrapolation of tev gamma - rays .",
    "the gamma - ray flux scales with the neutrino flux through the relation @xmath49 @xcite , assuming that the parent cosmic rays are produced with a power - law spectrum , @xmath50 . for @xmath51 mechanism ,",
    "the flux of hadronic gev gamma - rays depends on the properties of soft target photons in the source . for simplicity , below",
    "we assume that @xmath52 , with @xmath53 for @xmath54 in the @xmath7 interaction model .",
    "we assume that the sources are transparent to gamma - rays , i.e. they are not the hidden sources in gamma - rays .",
    "our study has found that the sources of track - like neutrino events should be @xmath1-ray dark in 0.2 - 100 gev , even during the neutrino emitting period .",
    "given a measured neutrino background flux by icecube , one can obtain a lower limit on the source number density with the upper limit on the neutrino luminosity of individual sources .",
    "the observed background neutrino flux implies a local energy production rate of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the local number density , @xmath57 is the averaged neutrino luminosity of the each source throughout the universe , @xmath58 is a dimensionless parameter that accounts for the redshift evolution of the sources , and @xmath59 is the all - flavor neutrino flux .",
    "the upper limit gamma - ray flux for one year _",
    "fermi_-lat observations , as listed in table [ lcdata ] , is on average @xmath60 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , so the limit on the neutrino flux of an individual source is also @xmath61 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 . as the neutrino source density is expected to peak at @xmath62 following the cosmic star formation rate , we take the luminosity distance of these neutrino sources as @xmath63 @xcite . then we obtain an upper limit of the neutrino luminosity of an individual source @xmath64 thus , a lower limit on the continuous source density may be written as @xmath65 for short - term transient neutrino sources , the upper limit gamma - ray flux for @xmath47 s observations is about @xmath66 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , so the energy released in neutrinos per event should be smaller than @xmath67 erg . using a similar approach",
    ", we find a lower limit on the event rate of the transients , i.e. , @xmath68    the above lower limits on the neutrino source density are useful for constraining the source models .",
    "the small number density of fsrqs @xcite , @xmath69 , suggests that they are not the main sources of these track - like neutrinos if @xmath70 .",
    "starburst galaxies , one the other hand , have a number density of @xmath71 , so they satisfy the above constraints . for short - term transients ,",
    "since high - luminosity grbs have a density of @xmath72 , one can rule out grbs as the main contributing sources of these neutrinos if @xmath73 ( i.e. the neutrino flux at tev - pev energies is a factor of @xmath74 larger than that in gev gamma - rays ) .",
    "since low - luminosity grbs have a density of @xmath75 , they can not be ruled out by our _ fermi_-lat data analysis .",
    "we note that the above constraint on the source density is independent of the constraints obtained by using the non - detection of high - energy neutrino multiplets in the icecube data @xcite .",
    "by using _ fermi_-lat observations , we searched for @xmath1-ray transient emission on timescales of hours to months coincident with icecube track - like neutrino events above 60 tev .",
    "the null result suggests that any associated gamma - ray flares must be at least one order of magnitude dimmer than that of the blazar pks b1424 - 418 , for which a pev cascade neutrinos is claimed to be associated . for three track - like neutrinos that occurred within the field of view of _ fermi_-lat at the time of the neutrino detection , we also searched for prompt gev emission coincident in time with these neutrinos .",
    "no significant gev emissions associated with these neutrino events are found . a few 3fgl @xmath9-ray objects locate within @xmath28 of the neutrino position , but the probability for chance coincidence is large .",
    "they are also too weak in gamma - ray emission to be reconciled with the neutrino emission . based on the non - detections of gev emissions ,",
    "the inferred local number density for continuous emitting sources to produce high - energy neutrinos should be @xmath76 mpc@xmath77 assuming a flat gamma - ray spectrum resulted from the @xmath7 mechanism for neutrinos .",
    "similarly , for transient sources , we obtain an event rate of @xmath78 .",
    "we also searched for possible hard x - ray transients observed by _",
    "swift_/bat that are coincident with the track - like neutrino events , but no x - ray flares are found to be spatially and temporally coincident with the neutrinos .",
    "some alternative explanations for non - detection of 0.2 - 100 gev emission accompanying icecube track - like neutrino events are possible .",
    "for example , if the high - energy photons produced in the pion mesons process can not escape freely from the source region ( i.e. the hidden sources in gamma - rays ) , they would not suffer from the above constraints .",
    "another possibility is that the gamma - ray luminosity at gev energies is far below that of the tev - pev neutrinos in the @xmath51 scenario when the energy threshold of cosmic rays for pion production in interactions with radiation fields is too high .",
    "future prompt follow - up observations in tev energies by imaging cherenkov telescopes , such as cta , hawc and lhaaso , would be useful to test the latter possibility .",
