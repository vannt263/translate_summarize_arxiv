    "while it is widely accepted that the onset of activity results from the feeding of a supermassive black hole by the gas reservoir from its host galaxy , there is no consensus on which mechanisms can remove virtually all of the gas angular momentum and drive the infall down to scales of tens of pc .",
    "furthermore , it is unknown whether these mechanisms are at work only in active galaxies , or , alternatively , if the key difference between agn and _ pure _ starburst or _",
    "quiescent _ galaxies resides in the availability of gas to supply the central engine .",

    "* garca - burillo  2003a ; garca - burillo  2003b ) ) is the first high - resolution ( @xmath20.5@xmath31@xmath3 ) co survey of 12 low luminosity agn ( llagn ) including the full sequence of activity types ( seyferts , liners and transition objects ) .",
    "observations were carried out with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "thus far , no interferometric survey had been focused on the study of agn in the local universe ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* helfer  2003 ) ) .",
    "high - resolution observations are paramount to achieve a sharp view of the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas down to the critical scales for agn feeding ( @xmath4100  pc ) . on these scales , _ secondary _ modes , embedded in kpc - scale perturbations ( e.g. , bars , spirals and tidal instabilities ) , are expected to take over .",
    "furthermore , to get a complete picture of the agn feeding issue nuga relies on a multi - wavelength approach .",
    "information on the stellar potentials and the star formation processes in nuga targets is obtained from available hst and ground - based optical / nir images .",
    "this multi - wavelength strategy allows us to test the efficiency of agn feeding mechanisms by a direct determination of the stellar gravitational torques exerted on the gas and , also , by numerical simulations of the gas dynamics .",
    "the first images issued from nuga reveal a wide variety of morphologies in the circumnuclear molecular disks of agn hosts ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "various gravitational instabilities develop at different spatial scales , including @xmath5=2 , @xmath5=1 and stochastic perturbations .",
    "some galaxies host several coexisting instabilities , while others host mainly one type of instability .",
    "the weak correlation between activity type and nuclear morphology of the agn host suggests that the agn duty cycle in llagns is shorter than the relevant time scale of the instabilities present in the maps .",
    "the relevant question to be addressed is to what extent the identified perturbations favour agn feeding or , eventually , if some of them can inhibit the process . as an illustration of the non - obvious quest for evidence of ongoing feeding in agns",

    "gas kinematics are perturbed by streaming motions related to @xmath5=1 _ modes_. the non - circular motions associated with the inner @xmath5=1 perturbations ( lopsided instability and inner @xmath0 spiral  arm - i ) fit the pattern expected for a trailing wave developed outside corotation ( fast wave ) .",
    "a paradoxical consequence is that the inner @xmath5=1 perturbations would not favour agn feeding .",
    "an independent confirmation that the agn is not being generously fueled at present is found in the low values of the gravitational torques exerted by the stellar potential for r@xmath4530  pc ( figure  [ fig : torques ] ) . while the radial variation of the stellar torques seem to account qualitatively for the changing signature of streaming motions , the maximum value of the mean torque is exceedingly small : @xmath250@xmath9 .",
    "the combination of the stellar perturbations seems to make the gas lose its angular momentum rather inefficiently ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garca - burillo  2003b ) for details ) .",
    "nuga observations of the liner ngc7217 have been compared with numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "the emerging scenario in this liner is _ apparently _ in direct contrast with what is found for ngc4826 : in ngc7217 , molecular gas is piled up in an axisymmetric ring and kinematics is seen to be dominated by regular rotation .",
    "n - body simulations developed in @xcite served to monitor the formation and evolution of the gas ring .",
    "results from these simulations show that gas inside the ring experiences positive gravity torques from the stellar oval perturbation which builds up the resonant ring near the ilr ; hence , gas in the inner 700pc is experiencing an outward flow . as for ngc4826 ( but for totally different reasons ! ) we find no evidence of significant ongoing fueling of the ngc7217 nucleus .",
    "only a gmc - like non self - gravitating unit coincident with the agn seems to betray a past accretion episode .",
    "the s1.9/l1.9 barred galaxy ngc4579 has been mapped at @xmath20.5@xmath3 resolution ( see figure  [ fig : feeding]_a , b _ adapted from garca - burillo  2004 , in prep ) .",
    "the molecular gas distribution in the inner 500pc mimics the gas response to a bar potential .",
    "the @xmath6co(21 ) map shows 1.6@xmath1010@xmath11m@xmath8 of molecular gas piled up in 2 leading lanes .",
    "however , the @xmath1 point - symmetry in the gas distribution breaks up in the inner 100pc disk where lopsidedness seems to take over .",
    "as illustrated by figure  [ fig : feeding]_a _ , the distribution of neutral gas close to the agn consists of a 150pc off - centered ringed disk which is also identified in the v ",
    "i color hst image of the galaxy .",
    "there is little molecular gas near the agn : the closest molecular complex ( at a radius r@xmath280pc ) has a mass of @xmath2a few 10@xmath12m@xmath8 .",
    "modelling work ( in progress ) is key to interpreting the complex kinematics of molecular gas near the agn , characterized by the presence of highly non - circular motions ( figure  [ fig : feeding]_b _ ) .",
    "results from numerical simulated orbits will shed light on the still controversial feeding issue in this seyfert .",
    "ngc6951 is a prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy for which subarcsec resolution co maps have been recently completed within the nuga project ( figure  [ fig : feeding]_c , d _ adapted from schinnerer  2004 , in prep ) .",
    "molecular gas distribution in the inner 700pc shows two highly contrasted nuclear spiral arms containing a significant gas reservoir of 4@xmath1010@xmath11m@xmath8 which is presently feeding an ongoing star forming episode , also identified by its prominent radio - continuum emission ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ho & ulvestad 2001 ) ) .",
    "the @xmath1 gas instability is likely reflecting gas crowding along the x@xmath13 orbits of the stellar bar .",
    "as can be guessed from figure  [ fig : feeding]_c _ , only a small amount of molecular gas seems to have succeeded in making its way down to the agn .",
    "a compact molecular complex of @xmath2a few 10@xmath7m@xmath8 appears to be linked to the central engine .",
    "furthermore , there is a northern molecular gas component related to the filamentary dusty spiral seen in the j  h color hst image .",
    "this stochastic instability might be efficient enough to feed the agn if it has overcome the likely positive stellar gravity torques inside the ilr .",
