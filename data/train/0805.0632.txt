    "it is well known that the practical application of superconductors crucially depends on the high electricity transport without dissipation , so the searching for new superconductors with a high transition temperature has attracted considerable attention in material science .",
    "recently , the novel superconductivity in iron - based layered superconductors has been reported , providing a new path to the high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the @xmath2 under doping with @xmath3 ions at the @xmath4 sites was first discovered to exhibit superconductivity with @xmath5 by kamihara et al @xcite .",
    "then the holes were introduced in @xmath2 by partially substituting @xmath6 with @xmath7 , the superconductivity was observed with @xmath8 k @xcite . shortly after these studies , @xmath9 was pushed up surprisingly to above 40 k when @xmath6 in @xmath10 was substituted by other rare earth elements @xcite . in later experiments , the maximum @xmath9 at about 55",
    "k was achieved in @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "though these superconductors have a high critical temperature , the mechanism and the possible difference compared with copper - based high-@xmath9 superconductors are still very controversial . obviously , more experimental and theoretical work are needed to understand the type - ii superconductivity as well as the microscopic mechanism in these new iron - based superconductors .",
    "since the vortex - lattice solid ( glass ) state without linear resistivity is crucial for the application of high-@xmath9 superconductors , the melting of the flux - lattice in bulk type - ii superconductors is of fundamental and practical significance @xcite .",
    "the elastic theory combined with the phenomenological lindemann criterion has been used to study the flux - lattice melting in layered superconductors@xcite , which is based on the instability of the crystal .",
    "however , the regular flux - lattice structure loses simultaneously in the melting , the information for vortex liquid is then lacking , so the lindemann criterion has drawback in the study of the vortex melting .",
    "the density functional theory has been successfully used in the flux - lattice melting of layered superconductors@xcite . due to the large anisotropy in these superconductors , weak josephson interaction between layers",
    "can be neglected , both the interplane and intraplane interaction between the pancake vortices are electromagnetic in origin .",
    "the density functional method is usually well appropriate for layered superconductors with large anisotropy .",
    "recently , a rather large anisotropy @xmath13 @xcite was found in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( 1111-type ) by a bond structure calculation .",
    "the strong anisotropy in these systems was also confirmed recently in experiments@xcite .    in this work , we study the flux - lattice melting in these two samples in the framework of the density functional theory and the mean - field substrate model proposed recently @xcite . in our first - principles calculations ,",
    "the input contains just a few parameters . the two - dimensional ( 2d ) one - component plasma ( ocp ) pair distribution functions ( pdf ) , 2d ocp static structure factors ( ssf ) and 2d ocp direct correlation functions ( dcf ) are calculated in the celebrated hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) closure .",
    "the validity of the hansen - verlet freezing criterion is analyzed .",
    "the melting lines for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are plotted by using the mean - field substrate approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the calculation of 2d ocp pdf . in section iii",

    "these functions are tabulated in a discrete form at about @xmath52 points .",
    "since the pdf decreases rapidly in the order of the mean inter - particle spacing , they can be cut off in the real space to simplify the calculation .",
    "the criterion for this cutoff is that the converged functions are not influenced . in our calculation , all of the converged functions are stable and the relative difference is less than @xmath53 .",
    "actually , the value of pdf saturates at high field , consistent with the well - known fact that the vortex system decouples to a 2d system at high field .",

    "we describe it briefly for completeness .",
    "since the interlayer interaction between vortices is much weaker than the intralayer one in the strongly anisotropic superconductors , the vortices can be regarded as a collection of pancake vortices . in this way",
    ", the interplane and out - of - plane interaction could be separated and the dcf can be written as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the out - of - plane interaction potential . in fourier space , the effective dcf of the mean - field substrate model takes the following form    @xmath65    we employ the above equation to extract the dcf based on the substrate model at different temperatures and magnetic fields .",

    "the hansen - verlet freezing criterion is successfully used in the classical liquid theory @xcite .",
    "this criterion states that the liquid freezes when the first peak of the structure factor reaches a critical value .",
    "the density functional theory in the vortex system of type - ii superconductors is also based on the classical liquid theory , thus it is necessary to analyze the validity of the hansen - verlet freezing criterion in this issue . actually , the single order parameter @xmath66 is just relative to the 2d hansen - verlet freezing criterion through the equation @xmath56 . for the vortex system in layered superconductors with a large anisotropy ,",

    "recently , a quite large vortex liquid area in @xmath0 compounds is observed in an experimental study based on the measurement of nernst signal @xcite , consistent with the melting lines predicted in the present work .",
    "interestingly , we find that in @xmath2 samples the melting line is changed substantially with the variation of @xmath3 content , the melting line for @xmath0 is much higher than that for @xmath1 .",
    "the very recently discovered ternary iron - arsenides @xmath72 ( 122-type)@xcite were suggested to be nearly isotropic@xcite . the present method to locate the melting lines of course can not be applicable to these superconductors with low anisotropy .",

    "@xcite these functions were obtained from monte - carlo simulations , while they are achieved @xmath73 @xmath74 from the microscopic vortex interaction in the present study .",

    "the 2d ocp pdf , 2d ocp ssf and 2d ocp dcf for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are calculated at different temperatures via the hnc closure and an efficient algorithm .",
    "it is shown that the melting lines are quite low , well consistent with an experimental study on the nernst signals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the melting line is observed to change considerably with the modulation of @xmath3 content in @xmath76-doped @xmath2 compounds , indicating that the interaction between vortices crucially depends on the @xmath3 content .",
