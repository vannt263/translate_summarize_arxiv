    "the detection by p09 of neutral species ( e.g. , , ) toward grb 080607 indicates that the bulk of the atomic gas was @xmath4100 pc from the grb , presumably beyond the photoionization sphere formed by the progenitor @xcite .",
    "however , whereas @xcite introduced an additional galactic - wide fuv field as means to suppress the formation of unobserved h@xmath0 , the discovery of more than 10@xmath5 @xmath2 of h@xmath0 toward grb 080607 , well shielded by dust extinction ( rest - frame @xmath6 mag ) , raises the possibility that the molecular material could have been in close proximity to the grb .",
    "the detection by p09 of absorption from rotationally - excited co , and the determination that atomic and molecular lines are kinematically distinguished by 30 @xmath7 15 km s@xmath8 , specifically allow for this scenario .",

    "previously , one galactic sight line was shown to have @xmath3500 absorption lines associated with h@xmath0 * ( * ? ? ? * toward hd 37903 ) , while the sample of low - redshift galaxies , meanwhile , that are found to emit ro - vibrational h@xmath0 * lines near 2.1 @xmath16 has been increasing steadily , albeit mostly attributed to shocked gas @xcite .",
    "our sight line toward grb 080607 at the redshift of z = 3.0363 is thus the most distant detection of h@xmath0 * , as well as the first extra - galactic detection of h@xmath0 * via absorption : this was made possible thanks to an extremely bright grb , an extremely capable optical system ( the lris spectrometer on the keck  i telescope ) , and a rapid response to the grb alert from @xmath17 .",
    "we also show , by a comparison with theoretical predictions , that this detection serves to confirm the general picture of the interaction between a grb and its immediate galactic environment .",

    "<S> grb 080607 has provided the first strong observational signatures of molecular absorption bands toward any galaxy hosting a gamma - ray burst . despite the identification of dozens of features as belonging to various atomic and molecular ( h@xmath0 and co ) carriers </S>",
    "<S> , many more absorption features remained unidentified . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on a search among these features for absorption from vibrationally - excited h@xmath0 , a species that was predicted to be produced by the uv flash of a grb impinging on a molecular cloud . following a detailed comparison between our spectroscopy and static , as well as dynamic , models of h@xmath0 * absorption , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a column density of 10@xmath1 @xmath2 of h@xmath0 * was produced along the line of sight toward grb 080607 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the assumed amount of dust extinction between the molecular cloud and the grb , the model distance between the two is found to be in the range 230940 pc . </S>",
    "<S> such a range is consistent with a conservative lower limit of 100 pc estimated from the presence of in the same data . </S>",
    "<S> these distances show that substantial molecular material is found within hundreds of pc from grb 080607 , part of the distribution of clouds within the grb host galaxy . </S>"
