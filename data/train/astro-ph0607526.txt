    "since galileo we enjoyed of an optical view first of the planets , stars , and later galaxy maps while , since last century we enlarged the astronomical electromagnetic windows in radio , infrared , uv , x , @xmath6 with great success",
    ". now a more compelling uhe @xmath5 astronomy at eevs energy is waiting at the corner .",
    "it is somehow linked to a very expected new particle astronomy : the uhecr at gzk energy @xmath7ev : it must be a limited and nearby one ( tens mpc ) because of cosmic bbr opacity .",
    "there have been since now two successfully neutrino astronomy at opposite low energy windows : the solar and the supernova ones .",
    "the solar ones has been explained by davis , gallex , sk , sno experiment in last four decades opening the @xmath5 physics to a solar neutrino mass splitting and a clear probe to its mixing behavior .",
    "the supernova sn 1987a was an unique event that anyway had a particular expected signatures at tens mev .",
    "on going experiment on cosmic supernova background in s.k .",
    "are at the threshold edges , possibly ready to a discover of this cosmic background .",
    "however there is a more exciting and energetic @xmath5 astronomy at pev and eev energy associate to the evidence of charged uhecr spectra at eev and tens hundred of eev band .",
    "indeed any eev cr originated nearby an agn or grb or bl lac jet will be partially screened by the same source lights leading to a consequent photo - pion production , associated with pev secondary neutrinos . in a much simpler and guaranteed way , at energy about @xmath8ev",
    ", uhecr should propagate in cosmic photon black body , being partially arrested by photopion productions , ( gzk cut - off ) , leading to eev neutrinos all along the universe confines .",
    "these uhe @xmath5 components , consequence of the gzk cut - off , are called cosmogenic or gzk neutrinos .",
    "their flux may be estimated by general arguments and there is quite a wide consensus on such neutrino gzk flux at eev energies .",
    "these _ guaranteed _ neutrinos may be complementary to possible _ expected _ higher energy neutrinos ( at zev energies ) whose role might explain uhecr isotropy and homogeneity being originated at cosmic distances . in this model uhecr born as nucleons via @xmath9 ( z - burst or z - shower model ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite are overcoming present ( agasa , hires , auger ) un - observed local ( virgo , perseus ) source distribution , as would be prescribed by naive gzk cut - off .",
    "however gzk neutrinos and z - burst neutrinos at eev are making comparable flux predictions and we shall restrict to the simplest gzk flux assumption . in conclusion",
    "we remind the role of neutrino masses in calibrating the z - burst showering and the influence in uhecr spectra .",
    "the tau production is limited , in general , to high energy charmed mesons , whose productions are rare and severely suppressed respect to lower energy pions ones . for this reason",
    "@xmath10,@xmath11 astronomy had a major attention in last century , also for the deeper @xmath12,@xmath13 penetration with respect @xmath14,@xmath15 and unstable tau .",
    "however the definite @xmath16 ( sk data ) disappearance and the flavour neutrino mixing has given to @xmath17,@xmath18 a new life and attention .",
    "indeed the additional possibility to oscillate , even at highest energy ( @xmath19ev ) energy and lowest mass splitting ( @xmath20ev ) , is guaranteed by the huge stellar galactic and cosmic distance ( @xmath21hundred pc ) .",
    "@xmath22 respect to the above oscillatory one . in some sense",
    "this @xmath23 neutrino astronomy offers additional proof of @xmath5 mixing.it should be noticed that on principle @xmath24 appearance may ( or is going to ) be revealed in sk events.however the conjure of @xmath23 large threshold energy ( 4gev ) and the small earth radius size make this possibility a different or marginal one.on the contrary a solar flare neutrino @xmath10 may travel and reach the earth at threshold tens gev energy and convert itself successfully into @xmath23 leading to a possible @xmath17 neutrino astronomy from solar flare @xcite .",
    "as the z boson peak favors uhe neutrinos in z - shower model for light neutrino masses ( @xmath28 zev @xmath29 ) , in the same way @xmath30 resonance ( @xmath31 ) favors energetic @xmath32 hitting and showering beyond mountain barrier ( as well as within air horizontal edges ) .",
    "the advantage of a mountain lay is double : a sharp filter for all the horizontal hadronic air shower ( and even muon tails ) and a dense beam dump where @xmath30 or @xmath33 may take place.these events are double ( first @xmath34 or @xmath35 event and later a @xmath23 decay);in water the phenomenon has been noticed nearly ten years ago , see @xcite .",
    "the idea of this @xmath23 showering in water was been considered as the double bang signatures , rarely observable in km@xmath36 detector .",
    "the some double bang reformulated _ in _ and _ out _ , _ in _ rock mountains ( or earth ) first and _ out _ within air , later , was the main proposal discussed first at the end of the previous century @xcite . in particulary since six years ago , see @xcite , the upgoing and horizontal air showers has been widely formulated for detention beyond mountain chain , as the alps and ande ones .",
    "these ideas had been promptly considered for on going auger experiment , just nearby ande mountain chain , see @xcite@xcite,@xcite . later on the same idea of _ old _ and _ regenerated _ horizontal air shower have been considered by other authors @xcite as well as by a wide list of additional authors @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the difference of the @xmath23 role in its crossing the earth lay is in its complex energy loss processes .",
    "ionization , bremsstralhung , pair production and photo - nuclear losses are suppressing the @xmath23 primary energy in such way its own lifetime may be shortened suppressing its propagation length .",
    "the understanding of the correct interaction length has been noticed by @xcite and it has been incorporated on 2000 by @xcite , and in the complete final @xmath23 radiation length @xcite,@xcite . while first and late attempts assumed a fixed @xmath37 parameter or a linear ones , the @xmath37 dependence with its logarithmic growth with energy has been considered correctly by @xcite ( and not other authors ) as it has been probed in detail only recently @xcite .",
    "one of the most common place in @xmath5 telescope astronomy is to consider @xmath38 because more penetrating than @xmath39 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this is true in the tev - pev energy .",
    "however the pev @xmath23 is already to escape a mountain , decay in flight and amplify its shower loudly , respect to a single @xmath38 escaping at some energy from a mountain .",
    "moreover the muon logarithmic growth is reached at eevs by a linear growth of an uhe @xmath23 , mostly because if the lepton is heavier , its electromagnetic loss is smaller .",
    "un - fortunately hadronic losses do not allow the @xmath23 to increase its penetration but @xmath23 is more penetrating a those uhe regime where @xmath5 astronomy overcome the atmosphere @xmath5 noise , see @xcite . in more sophisticated approach , not shown here for sake of simplicity , one may estimate the earth skin to tau air - shower for @xmath40 maximal lengths that guarantee a unsuppressed @xmath41 tau escape energy ; this minimal earth skin define a smaller volume and lower tau air - showering rate , but at highest @xmath42 energy @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath23 lengths for most adopted energy losses , the possible definition of a shorter length that guarantee a higher outgoing @xmath23 energy , all the detailed earth profile density for escaping @xmath23 and the consideration of the finite atmosphere size for escaping @xmath23 air shower , all these details have been analyzed in a tail of recent article @xcite.independent attention has grown in studying the upgoing @xmath23 flux in km@xmath36 detectors @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the general results are not always converging and a summary of the most recently results has been shown ( see last fig in ref.@xcite for general comparision ) .",
    "comparision ) .",
    "while we have not yet experienced @xmath23 definitive air showers , we may foresee that any neutrino @xmath23 astronomy will , soon or later , test the @xmath23 decay channels .",
    "indeed the main multiple @xmath23 decay channel are leading to weighted channel and showers described in pdg table .",
    "it will be possible , in principle , to verify by ratio of @xmath43 _ monocromatic _ channel versus @xmath44 channel , the @xmath45 abundance and the primary flavour mixing .",
    "in a few words @xmath23 air shower must be consistent and correlated , in its decay mode by electromagnetic , hadronic and hybrid channel , with well known elementary particle result .",
    "there are very advanced experiment that ( wherever they are aware or not ) might point for tau air - showers , even they were originally thought for other scientific targets .",
    "the list of these high energy showering experiment adaptable to tau neutrino and horizontal showering is here briefly reviewed : 1)argo , in tibet ; 2 ) milagro ( and milagrito ) in usa mountains,3 ) auger experiment in argentina , 4 ) space station crown arrays ( to be effectively proposed @xcite ) , 5 ) euso telescope , 6 ) batse satellite in cgro ( @xmath46 past ) , 7 ) ashra experiment in hawaii ( now continued by nutel collaboration ) , 8) crtnt fluorescence array in utah or china,@xcite 9 ) muon array telescope in jungfraujoch,@xcite 10 ) cherenkov telescopes on high mountains facing the mountains , like shalon in kazakistan .",
    "in this view the magic stereo telescopes facing the earth edges are somehow ideal @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath47 tests maybe done possibly in cloudy and otherwise astronomical useless nights . here below the images and the captions explaining how those experiments may find tau air - showering by a minimal optimized trigger set up .",
    "this large area array inside a deep valley in tibet may record pevs tau air - showers emerging from the mountains around .",
    "the nearby chines - japanese twin experiment may enlarge the area .",
    "the presence of more ( tens - hundreds ) spread ( small , few @xmath48 area ) elements at hundred meters one from the other , in vertical structure as well as the covering of the inner wall periphery of the detector house , may greatly increase the argo ability to reveal pevs air - showering below the mountain shapes .",
    "the variable opacity to atmospheric gevs - tevs muons within the mountain shadows , is a needed test .",
    "the existence of huge pools at peak mountains as milagro and smaller milagrito , offer an exiting laboratory to verify ( besides tev gamma backgrounds ) : the muon horizontal fluxes at horizons ; the muon bundle density , flux and structures ( in comparison with sea - level nemo - decor data , see @xcite,@xcite ) ; finally there is the possibility to discover up - going muon bundles , whose existence maybe indebt only to earth skimming ( uptaus ) air - showering .      as in figures and in captions",
    "the auger experiment offer a unique occasion to horizontal tau possibly from the west side toward the auger detector ; to optimize the ability to disentangle these events one should first observe the ande shadows ( at @xmath49 ) , zenith angles by a simple asymmetry east - west uhecr showering , see@xcite,@xcite@xcite,@xcite . within the first year of full operation the shadow @xmath50 be seen . later on , within the same solid angle of @xmath51 two event a year by tau air - showers ( via gzk neutrino flux )",
    "@xmath52 be very probably observed see @xcite .",
    "the auger fluorescence detector may enlarge their view also toward the ande , offering an ideal screen capturing ande - tau showers in horizontal tracks at best .",
    "the possibility to use inclined air - shower cherenkov lights hitting the fluorescence detector maybe exploited .",
    "multi - telescope coincident cherenkov detection ( while being nearly on axis ) of horizontal air - showers maybe applied in all the @xmath53 common directions ( @xmath54 ) in auger ( and @xmath55 for stereoscopic hires ) .      from the space",
    "there is the most appealing location to search for horizontal high altitudes showers and horizontal or vertical tau - air - showers ( hortau - uptau ) .",
    "this project is still preliminary .",
    "the crown - array maybe @xmath56 detecting ( tens , hundred kev ) gamma secondaries ( as well as rarer hundred gev lepton pairs ) as well as cherenkov lights due to far hadron and gamma primary high energy cosmic rays showering from earth .",
    "the array maybe at pevs - eevs energy equivalent to few - hundred km .",
    "mass neutrino detectors , depending on the telescope sizes and gamma array area.see @xcite,@xcite .      the project of a telescope facing down - ward the earth and catching the uhecr has been delayed to the end of the century .",
    "however the idea may offer a way to discover beamed horizontal hortaus at tens eev energy showering at high altitudes .",
    "few events , @xmath57 , might be observed each year .",
    "the euso mass equivalent due to earth - skimming @xcite , or hortaus @xcite neutrinos is nearly @xmath58 @xcite water equivalent , even taking into account the @xmath59 duty cycle of the euso activity.see @xcite .      on the top of the mountains",
    "small crown arrays of detectors may be mounted on the eolian energy stands .",
    "the usual sites ( mountain ) the power supply , the two different hight on the same element may offer a useful place to build an horizontal air - shower detector , in wild areas and spread surfaces @xcite .",
    "old generation of gamma satellite in orbit last decade made ( with deep discovers by beppo sax ) most of our view in gamma astronomy .",
    "present and next generation ( swift , glast ) will enlarge the egret astronomy by deeper views .",
    "the same skimming c.r . or albedo and air - shower tracing by uhecr ( pevs - eevs ) will naturally arise @xcite .",
    "three fluorescence detectors , in a similar way as auger telescopes , are monitoring from the top mountains of the hawaii island the inner area ; their detection maybe greatly enhanced by tracing and calibrating higher altitude hias and facing the earth edges , searching the hortaus at ocean horizons .",
    "the existence in the top europe turistic station of scientific facilities and fast transport made possible a first test of muon telescope array prototype at horizons site .",
    "the proposal of a larger area and more numerous detector is in progress and it may compete with cherenkov telescope also because of light noise independence of the scintillator array .",
    "the proposal of a fluorescence array within the cliff shadows is going to be considered in utah and - or in china .",
    "the pev detection will be possible by low noise light location and cherenkov aided discovering techniques .      a russian proposal leaded by cherenkov tev - telescope is already looking from the mountains terrestrial targets in search of eventual tau air - showers , finding already a statistics on albedo air - showers and relevant first calibrations .",
    "cherenkov gamma telescopes as last veritas and magic ones at the top of a mountains are searching for tens gev @xmath6 astronomy .",
    "the same telescope at zero cost in cloudy nights , may turn ( for an bending angle @xmath60 ) toward terrestrial horizontal edges , testing both common pevs cosmic ray air showers , muon secondary noises and bundles as well as upgoing tau air - showers . indeed",
    "the possible detection of a far air shower is enriched by :    1 .",
    "early cerenkov flash even dimmed by atmosphere screen 2 .",
    "single and multiple muon bundle shining cerenkov rings or arcs inside the disk in time correlation 3 .",
    "muon decaying into electromagnetic in flight making mini shower mostly outside the disk leading , to lateral correlated gamma tails .",
    "we estimated the rate for such pevs - eev events each night , finding hundreds event of noises muons and tens of bundle correlated signals each night @xcite . among them",
    "up - going tau air - showers may occur very rarely , but their discover is at hand for dedicated @xmath61 crown arrays @xcite(and arrays of these crowns ) in correlation among themselves and scintillator detectors .    .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    the timing of these signals , their expected event rate at pevs in a night time of magic at horizon ( @xmath62 zenith angle ) and their easy signature has been reported recently by fargion @xcite.more over the very simple exercise of the estimate of the air cone volume observed at the horizons by magic shows a value larger than @xmath63 corresponding to a mass volume larger than @xmath64 water equivalent.this volume at glashow resonance energies make magic the must wide @xmath5 detector.the some estimate even at smaller solid angle , below the horizon leads a large mass for eev neutrinos , encompassing volumes and masses as large as @xmath65.these detectors are active only within a narrow view , but during peculiar rise and down of bl lac , agn or crab like sources , or in coincidence with grbs along the horizon , the masses enlisted are huge and relevant.to make the detection permanent and in wider angle view the ideal crown array of magic - like telescope on circle and their twin or multiple array structure at few km distance , will guarantee a huge capability to observe an event or few event of @xmath23 upgoing shower during a month , within a few tens of uhecr above the edges .",
    "because muon tracks are mostly of downward atmospheric nature the underground neutrino telescope are tracing rarer upward ones mostly of atmospheric origin ; higher energy up - going astrophysical neutrino signals are partially suppressed by earth opacity , and are unique tracks . on the contrary @xmath23 air shower at horizons",
    "is spreading its signal in a wider area leading to populated ( millions - billions ) muon and gamma ( as well as electron pairs ) bundles in their showering secondary mode .",
    "this amplified signal may be observed and disentangled from farer and air filtered uhecr , in different ways and places : mountains , balloons , satellites with different detector array area and thresholds .",
    "the advantage to be in high quota is to be extending the visible target terrestrial area and solid angle , as well as to let a longer tau flight distance ( and energy ) , and to enlarge the air shower area ; a too high altitude , however , looses solid angle . to make an intuitive estimate the tau air - shower size area , at tens pevs - eevs , ( detectable at horizons within a lateral distance as large as @xmath66 km . from the main shower axis by a telescope like",
    "magic),it is nearly @xmath67 ; at eev energy the equivalent detection depth crossed by the tau lepton before the exit from the earth reaches @xmath68 distances ; the corresponding detection neutrino volume ( inside the narrow , conic @xmath69 , shower beam ) is within @xmath70 , in any given direction , see @xcite . a few events of grbs a year may be located within these horizons , as well as agn and bl lac in their flare activity . in such occasions magic , veritas and hess array",
    "are the most sensitive neutrino telescope at pevs - eev energy . even on average , for a present @xmath71 view of magic , at present energy thresholds , such telescopes ( for neutrino at glashow pevs energy windows ) , are testing a total mass - solid angle a comparable or larger than to @xmath72 , an order of magnitude comparable with the present amanda detector .",
    "moreover the light neutrino mass that seem to converge ( by recent cosmic constrains ) toward a light degenerated neutrino mass value @xmath73 seem to suggest a uhe primary neutrino at @xmath74 and a uhecr secondary bump at @xmath75 .",
    "in this view uhecr modulation at gzk energies may reflect lightest neutrino masses .    in conclusion a maximal alert for the neutrino air - showering within the earth shadows",
    "is needed : in auger , milagro , argo , as well as in ashra , crtnt , shalon telescopes the signal is beyond the corner .",
    "in particular the magic ( and veritas ) arrays telescopes facing from the mountains the horizons edges may soon test our proposal leading to such crown arrays . in a sentence",
    "we believe that the uhe neutrino astronomy is beyond the corner , tau is its courier and its sky lay just beneath our own sky : the earth ."
