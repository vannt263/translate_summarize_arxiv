    "the recent discoveries of extrasolar planets show our lack of knowledge about their formation , a multi - stage process taking us from dust grains to boulders to planetesimals to planetary embryos . here",
    "we are primarily looking at the initial phase  from microns to metres .",
    "in this paper we present the first three - dimensional numerical simulations that include the effects of hydrodynamical forces , self - gravity and gas drag upon an evolving dusty gas disk .",
    "we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( gingold & monaghan 1977 ; lucy 1977 ; monaghan 1992 ) technique which uses a collection of particles to approximate a fluid .",
    "we have written two slightly different sph codes describing these multiphase fluids .",
    "one was developed by robin humble ( humble et al . 2004 ) , the other was developed by laure barrire - fouchet starting from james murray s code ( murray 1996 ) .",
    "gas and dust phases are represented by two distinct types of particles .",
    "the equation of motion is given by maddison ( 1998 ) .",
    "the codes have been extensively compared and the main differences arise from the fact that humble s code allows higher resolution simulations and barrire - fouchet s code seems to be able to simulate smaller size particles .",
    "for large ( @xmath0 m ) and small ( @xmath1 m ) dust sizes , the dust distribution is expected to stay close to the initial flared disk .",
    "large grains ( boulders ) are weakly coupled to the gas , and if started in keplerian motion , they will remain there .",
    "conversely , tiny grains are so strongly coupled to the gas that they are essentially co - moving ( on the timescales we are examining here ) .",
    "the @xmath2 mm to @xmath0 cm interval is where all the ( short timescale ) interesting dynamics takes place . in the r - z plot of figure 1 , significant deviation from the initially flared disk occurs .",
    "the epstein drag is sufficiently strong that it is able to efficiently remove energy from the dust , and yet not so strong that the dust is tightly coupled to the gas .",
    "we have taken the initial steps to understanding dusty disk dynamics with full 3d hydrodynamics .",
    "the lagrangian nature of the code means that it is computationally trivial to add empirical grain growth models , to change equations of state , and to follow the grain temperature and density histories .",
    "this means it is potentially feasible to determine not just the location and mass of planetesimals , but also their likely composition .",
