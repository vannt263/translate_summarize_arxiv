    "multi - color light - curves of the afterglows of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources contain information about the evolution of the relativistic blast wave , which results from the progenitor explosion , as it expands into the surrounding medium .",
    "interpreted in the context of a theoretical afterglow model ( @xcite ) , the broad - band light - curve , if observed starting immediately after the grb through the time when the shock becomes non - relativistic , can , in principle , provide key physical parameters , including the total energy in the expanding ejecta , the density structure of the medium ( @xcite ) and whether the ejecta are spherically - symmetric or restricted to a jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical window of the afterglow spectrum is particularly useful for determining if the ejecta are highly collimated , since it is generally well - sampled on timescales of hours to days when temporal decay slope breaks due to this geometric effect become manifest .",
    "in addition , the effects of dust as seen through extinction are most easily observed in multi - color optical data .    only about a half - dozen grb afterglows have been well - sampled in the optical , with data of sufficient quality to test theoretical models and provide significant constraints on the physical parameters . in several cases , e.g. grb  990510 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , grb  991216 ( @xcite ) and grb  000301c ( @xcite ) , the optical light - curves exhibit achromatic breaks ,",
    "most easily understood as resulting from jet - like ejecta collimated to angles of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the implied degree of collimation reduces the inferred energy release for these events by factors of 50 - 300 .",
    "however other events such as grb  970508 show no evidence for collimation in the optical ( but may in the radio  see @xcite ) , indicating that the collimation angles are significantly larger .    in this letter",
    ", we present @xmath8 optical monitoring of the afterglow of grb  000926 performed by the palomar 60-inch and 200-inch , the mdm 2.4-m telescope , and the wise 1.0-m telescopes , and derive the optical transient light - curve from 1  7 days after the grb .",
    "in addition , we have obtained high - resolution hst / wfpc2 images in several bands , which allow us to properly subtract the contribution from nearby diffuse emission , possibly associated with the grb host .",
    "we have fit the multi - color data with an afterglow model and find that observed steepening of the light - curve requires the ejecta to be collimated in a cone . in the context of this model , consistency of the multi - color data and temporal decay",
    "also implies significant extinction , likely associated with the grb host .",
    "grb  000926 as observed by the _ inter - planetary network _",
    "( ulysses , konus - wind , and near ) on 2000 sep 26.993 ut had a duration of 25 seconds , placing it in the class of long - duration grbs .",
    "the position was triangulated to a relatively small error box of approximately 35  arcmin@xmath9 and distributed to the grb community 0.84 days after the burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bright @xmath10 afterglow of grb  000926 was identified by gorosabel et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and dall et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) from observations taken less than a day after the burst .",
    "spectra of the afterglow from the nordic optical telescope yielded an absorption redshift of 2.066 ( @xcite ) , later refined to 2.0369 @xmath11 0.0007 from keck spectroscopy ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations commenced with data taken by the mdm  2.4-m on sep 28.177 , 1.18 days after the burst .",
    "a complete log of our observations and resulting photometry can be found in table  [ tab - data ] .",
    "we used the @xmath8 filter system for all observations save those with the palomar 200-inch for which observations were obtained in the @xmath12 ( @xcite ) and sloan @xmath13 ( @xcite ) filters .",
    "we calibrated twelve secondary standards in the field from observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard star fields ( landolt fields 96 , 112 , 113 and 114 ) .",
    "these fields were observed with the palomar 60-inch telescope on two photometric nights .",
    "these observations are sufficient to fit extinction terms , but not to extract a color term which we took to be zero . from these standards and combined images of the field",
    "we also calibrated two fainter tertiary standards for use with larger telescopes .",
    "for the reference star of halpern ( 2000b ) , we find @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we estimate that these calibrations are accurate to approximately 3% .",
    "the palomar 200-inch telescope photometry were transformed to the @xmath8 system using the published transformations ( @xcite , @xcite ) and ot colors of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . a 3% systematic error in the transformation",
    "was added in quadrature to the statistical error in these measurements .",
    "we compared magnitudes of field stars measured with the palomar 60-inch telescope with transformed magnitudes from the 200-inch telescope photometry .",
    "this comparison suggests that our derived @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes for the ot are accurate .",
    "the @xmath22-band images display significant fringing , so the quoted formal errors do not represent the true measurement error .",
    "we estimated a systematic @xmath22-band error of 0.09  mag by fitting a straight line through the first four @xmath22-band measurements and adjusting the systematic error until @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to the ground - based photometric observations , we obtained high - resolution hst / wfpc2 images in f450w , f606w and f814w at three epochs as part of a long - term monitoring program with hst .",
    "the 6600 seconds ( 3 orbits ) f450w images were combined using the stsdas task ` crrej ` , while the 13200 seconds ( 6 orbits ) f606w and f814w images were combined and cosmic - ray rejected using the ` drizzle ` technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - hst ] displays the resultant f606w image .",
    "both ground - based ( @xcite ) and hst ( figure  [ fig - hst ] ) imaging have revealed the presence of a galaxy near the ot , which contaminates photometry of the ot by ground - based telescopes .",
    "proper treatment of this contamination is essential , since it can greatly influence the derived late - time slope , and consequently the important physical parameters .",
    "for example , rol , vreeswijk & tanvir ( 2000 ) have fit a late - time temporal slope of @xmath24 for this afterglow , which is considerably steeper than that of other afterglows observed to date .",
    "we therefore use our hst images to measure the contaminating galaxy flux in a 1.5 arcsecond aperture from the ot and convert these to @xmath8 using holtzman et  al .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab - gal ] .",
    "our @xmath21-band measurement of the galaxy contribution is fainter than the fit value of rol , vreeswijk & tanvir ( 2000 ) of @xmath25 , which may explain their steeper late - time slope .    in deriving flux values for all our ground - based data ,",
    "we use a 1.5-arcsecond aperture .",
    "this allows us to accurately subtract the galaxy flux in a straightforward way , using the values tabulated above .",
    "we note that there may be an additional compact component of the host emission not resolved by hst ( which may be observed in subsequent , scheduled observations ) .",
    "however , since the light - curve shows no significant flattening , this is not likely to be an important contribution over the interval of our observations .",
    "since the aperture size used in measurements reported through the grb coordinate network circulars ( gcn ) is generally unspecified and variable , the amount of contamination by the galaxy in each measurement can not be determined .",
    "consequently , we include only measurements taken within one day of the grb ( @xcite , @xcite ) , in addition to the measurements presented in this paper in constructing the light - curve .",
    "these data are important for constraining the early - time temporal slope , and at these times , the ot is bright and the contamination by the galaxy is negligible .",
    "the measurements from the gcn were re - calibrated using our secondary standards .",
    "we correct all measurements for foreground galactic extinction using @xmath26 mag from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) . in figure  [ fig - plot ]",
    "we display the ot light - curve in which the contribution from the host galaxy has been subtracted and the galactic reddening has been accounted for .",
    "a single power - law temporal decay is clearly excluded , with a probability that it fits the data of @xmath27 .    in order to characterize the light - curve ,",
    "we have fit it to the functional form ( @xcite ) @xmath28 ^{-1/s}.   \\label{eq - function}\\ ] ] this function has no physical significance , but provides a simple and general parametric description of the data , allowing for a gradual break in the afterglow decay . in this function ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the early and late time asymptotic temporal slopes respectively , @xmath31 is the time of the temporal slope break , @xmath32 is the spectral slope , and @xmath33 is a parameter that determines the sharpness of the transition .",
    "we leave the break sharpness as a free parameter , since there is disagreement over its theoretical value ( eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "we first fit equation [ eq - function ] without any constraints , applying 5% systematic error ( in addition to the errors given in table  [ tab - data ] above ) to all measurements to reflect uncertainties in zero point calibrations for the different telescopes and in the conversion of wfpc2 magnitudes to @xmath8 .",
    "this form fits well , with @xmath34 and the fit parameters @xmath35 days , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where the errors do not reflect covariance between the parameters .",
    "the best fit value for the break sharpness value is @xmath39 , but is not well constrained , due to the lack of early - time data .",
    "figure  [ fig - plot ] shows this fit overplotted on the data points .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observed break in the light - curve is consistent with being achromatic , since the parameter @xmath31 is independent of frequency .",
    "this frequency - independent steepening of the optical light - curve is most easily interpreted as due to collimated , or jet - like ejecta .",
    "once the lorentz factor of the ejecta falls below the inverse of the opening angle of the jet the light - curve steepens due to geometric effects , as well as due to the sideways expansion of the ejecta ( rhoads 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "interpreted in this context , the early and late - time light - curve slopes , the optical spectral index , and the time of the transition constrain the index of the electron spectral energy distribution , @xmath40 , the jet opening angle and the total energy of the afterglow .",
    "we now adopt the simple model developed by sari , piran and halpern ( 1999 ) .",
    "this model predicts the temporal and spectral evolution of synchrotron radiation from a jet expanding relativistically in a constant density medium .",
    "the early- and late - time temporal slopes and the optical spectral slope are determined by the electron spectral index , @xmath40 , and the break time is determined by the jet opening angle .",
    "optical data alone do not have sufficient frequency coverage to locate all of the afterglow spectral breaks . specifically , with the optical light - curve we can not constrain the position of the cooling break , @xmath41 , and we must consider two cases : 1 ) @xmath41 is blue - ward of the optical ( henceforth referred to as `` case b '' ) ; and 2 ) @xmath41 is red - ward of the optical ( henceforth `` case r '' ) .",
    "we find that when we fit light - curves from all optical bands simultaneously ( linking the spectral slope and the two temporal decay slopes ) using the theoretical predictions of the model , we can not produce an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "our @xmath42 values of 195 and 83 for 47 degrees of freedom for case b and case r respectively correspond to a probability that the model describes the data of less than @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , the observed optical spectral index is inconsistent with the model , being too steep for the value of @xmath40 determined from the temporal decay slopes .",
    "this problem can be resolved if we include the effect of extinction in the host galaxy of the grb , which can modify the spectral index .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the strong equivalent widths of absorption lines observed in spectra of this afterglow from the keck telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the appropriate extinction law is , however , unknown and unconstrained by our data , so to determine the source - frame @xmath44 we consider several possibilities .",
    "we allow for extinction laws corresponding to young star - forming regions ( such as the orion nebula ) , the milky way , the lmc and the smc by using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) and the fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) extinction curves , with the smooth joining calculated by reichart ( 1999 ) .    including extinction",
    "provides an acceptable fit to the multi - band data for both cases , with an electron energy spectral index @xmath45 which is consistent with that found for other afterglows . for case",
    "b , the derived @xmath44 values range from 0.82 mag for the milky way extinction law to 0.28 mag and 0.25 mag for the lmc and the smc extinction laws ( @xmath46 for 46 degrees of freedom ) , with a break time of @xmath47 days . for case r , @xmath44 is 0.36/0.12/0.11 for milky way / lmc / smc extinction , with a break time of @xmath48 days . in both cases ,",
    "an extinction law corresponding to a young star - forming region does not fit the data , since it is ` grey ' in the source - frame uv .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is insensitive to the extinction law and the position of the cooling break to within the quoted error .",
    "we calculate the corresponding jet half - opening angle using sari , piran & halpern ( 1999 ) to be @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the density of the ism , in units of @xmath51 .",
    "our well - sampled multi - color light - curve of the afterglow of grb  000926 is well - described by a physical model where the ejecta are collimated in a jet .",
    "the degree of collimation reduces the inferred isotropic radiated energy of the grb ( @xcite ) by a factor of 275 , to @xmath52 ergs .",
    "this inferred energy release is typical of events observed to - date .",
    "furthermore , we find that in order to properly fit the light - curve of this afterglow extinction is required . assuming the extinction is at the measured redshift of @xmath53 ( @xcite )",
    ", we can exclude an extinction law corresponding to a young star - forming region , and we find an @xmath44 ranging from 0.11  0.82 mag , depending on the assumed curve and on the cooling regime .",
    "this value exceeds the expected extinction from our own galaxy , and is likely due to the host galaxy of the grb .",
