    "stochastic control is now a mature and well established subject of study @xcite .",
    "though not explicitly stated at most of the times , a standing assumption in the study of stochastic control is the time consistency , a fundamental property of conditional expectation with respect to a progressive filtration . as a result , an optimal control viewed from today will remain optimal viewed from tomorrow .",
    "time - consistency provides the theoretical foundation of the dynamic programming approach including the resulting hjb equation , which is in turn a pillar of the modern stochastic control theory .    however , there are overwhelmingly more time - inconsistent problems than their time - consistent counterparts .",
    "hyperbolic discounting @xcite and continuous - time mean  variance portfolio selection model @xcite provide two well - known examples of time - inconsistency .",
    "probability distortion , as in behavioral finance models @xcite , is yet another distinctive source of time - inconsistency .",
    "one way to get around the time - inconsistency issue is to consider only pre - committed controls ( i.e. , the controls are optimal only when viewed at the initial time ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite and all the follow - up works to date on the markowitz problem , as well as @xcite on the behavioral portfolio choice problem . while these controls are of practical and theoretical value , they have not really addressed the time - inconsistency nor provided solutions in a dynamic sense .",
    "motivated by practical applications especially in mathematical finance , time - inconsistent control problems have recently attracted considerable research interest and efforts attempting to seek equilibrium , instead of optimal , controls . at a conceptual level , the idea is that a decision the controller makes at every instant of time is considered as a game against all the decisions the future incarnations of the controller are going to make .",
    "equilibrium \" control is therefore one such that any deviation from it at any time instant will be worse off . taking this game perspective , ekeland and lazrak @xcite",
    "approach the ( deterministic ) time - inconsistent optimal control , and bjrk and murgoci @xcite and bjrk , murgoci and zhou @xcite extend the idea to the stochastic setting , derive an ( albeit very complicated ) hjb equation , and apply the theory to a dynamic markowitz problem .",
    "yong @xcite investigate a time - inconsistent deterministic linear ",
    "quadratic control problem and derive equilibrium controls via some integral equations . however , study of time - inconsistent control is , in general , still in its infancy .    in this paper",
    "we formulate a general stochastic linear ",
    "quadratic ( lq ) control problem , where the objective functional includes both a quadratic term of the expected state and a state - dependent term .",
    "these non - standard terms each introduces time - inconsistency into the problem in somewhat different ways .",
    "different from most of the existing literature @xcite where an equilibrium control is defined within the class of _ feedback _ controls , we define our equilibrium via open - loop controls .",
    "then we derive a general sufficient condition for equilibriums through a system of forward ",
    "backward stochastic differential equations ( fbsdes ) .",
    "a intriguing feature of these fbsdes is that a time parameter is involved ; so these form a _ flow _ of fbsdes .",
    "when the state process is scalar valued and all the coefficients are deterministic functions of time , we are able to reduce this flow of fbsdes into several riccati - like odes , and hence obtain explicitly an equilibrium control , which turns out to be a linear feedback .    in the latter part of the paper , we study a continuous - time mean",
    " variance portfolio selection model with state dependent trade - off between mean and variance .",
    "a similar problem was first considered in @xcite in the framework of feedback controls and its solution derived via a very complicated ( generalized ) hjb equation .",
    "here we allow random market parameters ( hence the model and approach of @xcite will not work ) and consider open - loop equilibriums . applying the general sufficient condition and working through a delicate analysis",
    ", we will solve the corresponding fbsdes and obtain equilibrium strategies .",
    "again , these strategies happen to be linear feedbacks .",
    "we also compare our strategies with the ones in @xcite when all the market coefficients are deterministic , and find that they are generally different .",
    "this suggests that how we define equilibrium controls is critical in studying time inconsistent control problems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to the formulation of our problem and the definition of equilibrium control . in section [ formal - derivation ]",
    ", we apply the spike variation technique to derive a flow of fbsdes and a sufficient condition of equilibrium controls .",
    "based on this general result , we solve in section [ deterministic - case ] the case when the state is one dimensional and all the coefficients are deterministic . in section [ random - case ] , we formulate a continuous - time mean  variance portfolio selection model which is a special case of the general lq model investigated , and derive explicitly its solution .",
