    "although the primary process occurring in the light - harvesting complex , is the electron transfer between acceptor and donor , and the transfer to the reaction center appears as secondary process , the two processes should not be separated from one another .",
    "both processes are nothing but two parts of the total light harvesting .",
    "a few years ago , evidence of coherent quantum energy transfer has been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite demonstrated that photosynthetic bio - complexes exhibit collective quantum coherence during primary electron transfer processes that occur on the time scale of some hundreds of femtoseconds .",
    "furthermore , the coherence in such a system exhibits a bi - exponential decay consisting of a slow component with a lifetime of hundreds of femtoseconds and a rapid component with a lifetime of tens of femtoseconds @xcite . the long - lived components are correlated with intramolecular modes within the reaction center , as shown experimentally @xcite .    these results induced different theoretical considerations which are related to the role of quantum coherence in the photosynthesis .",
    "for example , the equivalence of quantum and classical coherence in electronic energy transfer is considered in @xcite . in @xcite , the fundamental role of noise - assisted transport",
    "is investigated . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the efficiency is increased by reducing radiative recombination due to quantum coherence .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in these ( and many other ) papers is assumed to be hermitian although photosynthesis is a process that occurs in an open quantum system .    in the description of an open quantum system by means of a non - hermitian hamilton operator ,",

    "mostly , the environment is the extended continuum of scattering wavefunctions , see e.g. the review @xcite .",
    "coherence is an important ingredient of this formalism .",
    "meanwhile the non - hermitian formalism is applied successfully to the description of different realistic open quantum systems , see the recent review @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite is one of the oldest references in which the resonance structure of the cross section in the regime of overlapping resonances is considered in the non - hermitian formalism . in this paper , the resonance structure of the nuclear reaction @xmath0 with two open decay channels is traced as a function of the degree of overlapping of the individual resonances by keeping constant the coupling strength between the localized part of the system and the environment of scattering wavefunctions .",
    "the distance between the energies of the individual resonance states is varied by hand . as a result ,",
    "two short - lived states are formed at a critical value of the degree of overlapping .",

    "the dynamics of the system and the efficiency of electron transfer are studied in a non - hermitian formalism by taking into account noise acting between donor and acceptor , while in @xcite , the role of protein fluctuation correlations in the electron transfer is investigated and the spin - echo approach is extended to include bio - complexes for which the interaction with dynamical noise is strong .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to provide the general formalism of non - hermitian physics of open quantum systems @xcite by inclusion of gain which simulates the acceptor , as well as of loss which stands for the donor @xcite .",

    "however , each ep in one of the two submatrices in ( [ ham22 ] ) influences the dynamics of the open two - channel system .",
    "this will be shown in the following section by means of numerical results for the case that there is an ep in the first channel which simulates acceptor and donor ( gain and loss ) , while the second channel being of standard type with resonance states , may or may not have an ep .",
    "we performed some calculations for the two - channel case by starting from the calculations for the one - channel case in , respectively , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] and by adding a second channel that describes decaying states ( corresponding to loss ) .",
    "there are , of course , very many possibilities for choosing the number of states as well as the parameters for the second channel .",
    "one possibility is to keep the parameters constant by varying the parameter @xmath3 of the first channel .",
    "another possibility is to relate them directly to the parameter @xmath3 , or to introduce another independent parameter @xmath155 .",
    "the choice should correspond to the physical situation considered .",
    "the aim of our calculations is to illustrate the influence of a second channel onto the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath138 and onto the contour plot of the cross section .",
    "we exemplify this by choosing parameter dependent values @xmath11 in the first channel and parameter independent values @xmath156 in the second channel . in the following",
    ", we show a few characteristic results .",
    "we start these calculations with two channels by choosing two merged states with gain and loss according to fig .",
    "the second channel contains two resonance states @xmath157 with negative widths and @xmath158.a , b and c , d , e , respectively , show the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the first channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig2].a - e ) as well as the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the second channel .",
    "the last ones are constant as function of the parameter @xmath3 what follows from the assumption of their parameter independence .",
    "the contour plots of the cross section ( figs . [ fig2].f and [ fig5].f )",
    "are different from one another .",
    "common to both of them is that the cross section does not vanish in a finite range of the energy around @xmath159 for all @xmath3 . under the influence of the two states in the second channel which are exactly in this energy and parameter range",
    ", the cross section is somewhat reduced .",
    "it does however not vanish .",
    "these ( and similar ) simulations show clearly the following result .",
    "the fluctuations of the cross section which are caused by the merging of two states with gain and loss in the first channel , excite resonance states in the second channel .",
    "this happens although the nature of both channels is completely different .",
    "in the first channel , internal degrees of freedom of the system are not excited , while the appearance of the resonance states in the second channel occurs via excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system .      in these calculations",
    "we start from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the first channel .",
    "the second channel contains only one state .",
    "the eigenvalue and eigenfunction pictures fig .",
    "[ fig6].a - e contain the eigenvalues and eigenfunction trajectories of fig .",
    "[ fig4].a - e as well as those of the second channel , e.g. the energy trajectories at @xmath160 and width trajectories at @xmath161 .",
    "the phase rigidity approaches the value @xmath12 at @xmath162 in both cases .",
    "the corresponding contour plot of the cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6].f .",
    "it is related to the contour plot of the first channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig4].f ) ; and shows additionally the parameter independent state of the second channel in the whole parameter range .",
    "we performed further calculations with parameters similar to those used in fig .",
    "[ fig6].a - e and show two of the corresponding contour plots in figs .",
    "[ fig6].g , h .",
    "both contour plots are obtained with the comparably large width @xmath163 ; the two energies @xmath164 are however different from one another .",
    "the difference between @xmath165 and @xmath166 can clearly seen in the corresponding contour plots figs .",
    "[ fig6].g and h.    the results of these simulations with level repulsion in the first channel and one state in the second channel show the same characteristic features as those discussed above for merging states .",
    "the fluctuations observed in the first channel are able to excite resonance states in the second channel .",
    "the situation with two states in the second channel is richer than that with only one state because the two states can mix via the common continuum .",
    "we show results for one special case in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , the eigenvalue figures [ fig7].a , b contain the eigenvalue trajectories of both channels .",
    "the eigenfunction trajectories refer to the existence of an ep in the second channel : the phase rigidity of states related to the second channel is independent of the parameter @xmath3 , as expected .",
    "it is however smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "also the mixing @xmath167 of the two wavefunctions via the common continuum in the second channel shows small deviations from the expectations .",
    "the relation of these results for the eigenfunctions of @xmath168 to an ep in the second channel is discussed in detail in appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "the contour plot fig .",
    "[ fig7].f shows the same characteristic features as fig .",
    "[ fig6].f . both , its relation to the contour plot of the first channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig4].f ) as well to the parameter independent state of the second channel can clearly be seen .",
    "thus , the fluctuations observed in the first channel excite resonance states in the second channel also in this case .    summarizing the numerical results shown in the three figures [ fig5 ] to [ fig7 ] we state the following . gain and loss in the first channel and excitation of resonance states in the second channel are a _ uniform",
    "_ process .",
    "this process can be described as a whole in the formalism for the description of open quantum systems which is used in the present paper .",
    "in our paper , we considered gain and loss in an open quantum system @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the interplay of these two opposed processes in the neighborhood of singular points where it causes fluctuations of the cross section .",
    "these fluctuations are observable and can excite resonance states in the system .",
    "the time scale of the fluctuations and that of the excitation of resonance states are very different .",
    "the fluctuations of the cross section occur quickly , without any excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the excitation of resonance states is however much slower , and internal degrees of freedom of the system are involved .",
    "we sketched first the formalism by means of which both the interplay between gain and loss in an open quantum system @xcite and the excitation of resonance states can be described as a uniform process . in any case , the widths @xmath135 of the states are ( generally ) different from zero . in the first case we have two states with different sign of the widths ( corresponding to gain and loss ) , while the states in the second case are standard decaying ( resonance ) states with negative sign @xcite .    generally , the cross section related to the two states with gain and loss vanishes .",
    "deviations from this rule may appear in the neighborhood of singular ( exceptional ) points , where they may cause non - vanishing fluctuations of the cross section .",
    "these fluctuations have nothing in common with resonances .",
    "rather , they are merely deviations from the vanishing value of the cross section and are _ not _ related to the excitation of any internal degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "they occur therefore with an efficency of nearly 100 % at a very short time scale .",
    "the fluctuations caused by the interplay of the states with gain and loss , are observable and may excite resonance states of the system after a comparably long time ( which corresponds to the widths @xmath169 of these states ) .",
    "the whole process of gain and loss together with the excitation of resonance states is therefore characterized by two very different time scales : the quick process which creates the fluctuations , and the slow process which is related to the excitation of resonance states .",
    "the decay occurs thus bi - exponential .",
    "initially , it is determined by the quick process of the interplay between gain and loss .",
    "somewhere at its tail however , it will switch over to the slow process with excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the states with gain and loss as well as the resonance states excited by the fluctuations , can each interact via a common environment into which the corresponding states are embedded .",
    "the two environments ( channels ) will _ never _ mix .",
    "this request is guaranteed in our formalism due to the very different time scales of the two processes . in any case , this so - called external mixing of the states occurs additionally to the direct so - called internal mixing of the states which is supposed in our calculations to be involved in the complex energies @xmath170 of the states .    according to the numerical results of our paper ,",
    "the fluctuations are very robust .",
    "they appear in a relatively large finite parameter range around eps .    finally , we mention a few interesting results which are characteristic of open quantum systems including those considered in the present paper",
    ".    1 .   the states of an open quantum system may interact via a common environment into which the system is embedded .",
    "this mixing is called usually external interaction .",
    "2 .   the states of an open quantum system may have positive or negative widths .",
    "the states with positive width @xcite gain particles ( or information ) from the environment while those with negative width loose particles ( or information ) due to their coupling to the environment . as function of a parameter",
    ", gain may pass into loss and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the phases of the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator are , generally , not rigid , see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig7 ] and @xcite .",
    "irreversible processes determine the evolution of an open quantum system up to the occurrence of orthogonal eigenstates at maximum width or level repulsion , see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and @xcite .",
    "we mention further that results similar to those discussed above for systems with two states , appear also in calculations for systems with more than two states , see @xcite .",
    "in our paper , we provided some results for a two - step process which we obtained in the framework of the non - hermitian formalism @xcite for the description of open quantum systems .",
    "the first step is the interplay between gain and loss of particles from an environment , while the second step is the excitation of a resonance state .",
    "the two steps are treated as two parts of the whole process .",
    "the total process might simulate photosynthesis : the first step is the capture of light in the light - harvesting complex while the second step is the transfer of the excitation energy to the reaction center which stores the energy from the photon in chemical bonds .",
    "that means : gain simulates the acceptor for light , and loss stands for the donor which excites a resonance state and simulates the coupling to the sink .",
    "altogether , the energy of the light is transferred to the reaction center of the light - harvesting complex .",
    "the obtained results are very robust , and fluctuations play an important role .",
    "the results show some characteristic features which correspond , indeed , to those discussed in the literature for the photosynthesis .",
    "most interesting are the following results of our calculations :    1 .   the efficency of energy transfer is nearly 100 % ; 2 .",
    "the energy transfer takes place at a very short time scale ; 3 .",
    "the storage of the energy in the reaction center occurs at a much longer time scale ; 4 .",
    "according to points 2 and 3 , the decay is bi - exponential .    in future studies",
    ", the theoretical results have to be confirmed by application of the formalism to the description of concrete systems in close cooperation between theory and experiment .    * acknowledgment *    we are indebted to j.p .",
    "bird for valuable discussions .",
    "at an ep the two eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath6 are exchanged according to ( [ sec8 ] ) . in more detail : tracing the eigenfunctions of @xmath6 as function of a certain parameter @xmath155 , the two eigenfunctions jump according to ( [ sec8 ] ) at the critical parameter value @xmath171 which defines the position of the ep .",
    "some years ago , it has been shown @xcite that the influence of the ep is not restricted to the jump occurring at @xmath172 .",
    "it appears rather in a finite parameter range of @xmath155 in which the wavefunctions of the two states are mixed according to @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "the two wavefunctions @xmath175 vary smoothly ( i.e. without any jump of the sign of their components ) everywhere but at @xmath171 . using the representation @xmath176 @xmath177",
    "depends on the parameter @xmath155 . after removing a common phase factor , it follows @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively , in approaching @xmath171 ; and @xmath180 or @xmath181 when @xmath155 is far from the critical region around @xmath172 . in between the values @xmath182 and @xmath183 ,",
    "the angle @xmath177 varies smoothly .",
    "corresponding to the dependence of @xmath177 on the parameter @xmath155 , also the phase rigidity ( [ eif7 ] ) depends on this parameter in a certain finite parameter range .",
    "the phase rigidity is determined by the ratio @xmath184 which approaches @xmath97 at the ep ( due to @xmath185 ) and @xmath12 far from the ep ( because here the wavefunctions are almost real ) .",
    "the intermediate values of the phase rigidity @xmath96 are determined by the expression ( [ app3 ] ) calculated with the actual values @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the results of these calculation give values for @xmath96 that are between the two limiting values @xmath97 and @xmath12 .    fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows numerical results for the eigenfunctions of @xmath6 which are obtained for calculations with two channels and two states in the second channel .",
    "we see the values @xmath96 for the states of the first channel ( see figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) as well as those for the two states of the second channel .",
    "they are independent of one another .",
    "the @xmath96 related to the second channel are constant in the whole parameter range @xmath3 shown in the figures ( which is defined for the first channel ) .",
    "they may be smaller than 1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the results obtained for the phase rigidity @xmath188 of the two states in the second channel , may be considered as a proof of the finite parameter range in which an ep influences the properties of the system .",
    "the value @xmath188 is nothing but an expression for the distance of the system from an ep in the second channel : the larger @xmath96 , the more distant is the ep , while @xmath108 indicates that the ep is approached .",
    "thus , the value @xmath96 in the eigenfunction pictures of the two - channel system with two states in the second channel additionally to those of the one channel system ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) , allows us to determine the position of the ep in the second channel .",
