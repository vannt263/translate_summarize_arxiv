    "the large scale structure of the universe developed from initial mass density and velocity fluctuations through gravitational instability . much of the information of the initial perturbations is  forgotten \" during the gravitational nonlinear evolution . yet",
    ", some features of the initial perturbations are imprinted in the cosmic mass and velocity fields at present .",
    "measuring these memorized features is crucial in studying the initial states of the universe .",
    "a well known example is the self - similarity of gravitational clustering , which imprints the initial power spectrum index and is detectable with the scaling behavior of correlation functions of the present mass field ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the spatial locality of the perturbed mass field in phase space , which is also a feature to be memorized in mass field today .",
    "the physics of spatial locality of correlation function in phase space can be illustrated with a gaussian mass field @xmath14 described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fourier counterpart of the density contrast @xmath17/\\overline{\\rho}$ ] , @xmath18 the power spectrum of the mass field , and @xmath19 the kronecker delta function .",
    "eq.(1 ) says that the fourier modes with different wavevector @xmath20 are uncorrelated , or the correlation is localized in @xmath10-space .",
    "this is because the phase of the fourier modes @xmath21 is random . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function of density perturbations in physical ( @xmath22 ) space generally is non - local .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath23 has non - zero correlation length when the fourier power spectrum @xmath18 of eq.(1 ) is @xmath10-dependent .    in a phase - space description",
    ", the mass field is decomposed into modes @xmath0 , the perturbations in the wavevector(scale ) from @xmath20 to @xmath24 and physical range @xmath6 to @xmath4 .",
    "the volume of the phase space cell referring to a mode is given by the uncertainty relation @xmath25 .",
    "the correlation function of a gaussian field generally is localized regardless whether the fourier power spectrum is colored .",
    "that is , @xmath26 the reason for eq.(2 ) is straightforward .",
    "first , the perturbations @xmath0 and @xmath5 are , respectively , given by linear superposition of the fourier modes in different wavebands ( @xmath20 , @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . for a gaussian field",
    ", the fourier modes in different wave band are uncorrelated in general [ eq.(1 ) ] .",
    "this gives rise to the factor of @xmath30 of eq.(2 ) .",
    "second , the phases of the fourier modes of gaussian field are random . for a superposition of the fourier modes in the band ( @xmath20 , @xmath31 ) with random phase ,",
    "the coherent length of the phase of @xmath32 is not larger than @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial distance between two cells in the ( @xmath34 ) space is at least @xmath35 .",
    "this yields the factor @xmath36 of eq.(2 ) .",
    "therefore , the phase space correlation function eq.(2 ) for gaussian field generally is local .",
    "non - linear evolution via gravitational clustering will lead to a non - gaussian field that will deviate from the locality of eq.(2 ) , even when the initial field is gaussian .",
    "however , turbulence studies have found that if 1 . )",
    "the initial perturbations are spatially localized , and 2 . )",
    "the random fields evolve via a self - similar hierarchical cascade process , the phase space correlation function of the evolved field will still be spatially localized ( greiner , lipa , & carruthers , 1995 , greiner et al .",
    "the perturbations of modes @xmath0 and @xmath5 with @xmath37 stay statistically uncorrelated or only very weakly correlated during the self - similar hierarchical cascade evolution . that is , the factor @xmath38 of eq.(2 ) is memorized during the dynamical evolution .",
    "phenomenological models that mimic the hierarchical clustering of the cosmic mass field have similar mathematical structures as the hierarchical cascade models of turbulence .",
    "for instance , the fractal hierarchy clustering model of soneira & peebles ( 1977 ) is the same as the @xmath39 model of turbulence ( e.g. frisch , 1995 ) .",
    "the block model of cole & kaiser ( 1988 ) is a special case of the multifractal cascade model ( meneveau & sreenivasan 1987 , pando et al 1998 ) .",
    "hence , these models should also memorize the spatial locality .",
    "recently , the spatial locality has been studied with more realistic dynamical models of gravitational clustering .",
    "first , if the weakly nonlinear mass field is given by the zeldovich approximation , the field is found to be spatially localized if the initial perturbations are gaussian ( pando , feng & fang 2001 ) .",
    "more recently , this result has been extended to fully nonlinear regime ( feng & fang 2004 ) . using the halo model of the large scale structure ( e.g. cooray & sheth 2002 , and references therein )",
    ", it has been shown that the evolved mass field is approximately spatially localized if the initial perturbations are gaussian .",
    "although gravitational coupling is long - term , the spatial locality in the phase space is not disturbed by the non - linear evolution of cosmic mass field .",
    "this property essentially is due to the self - similarity of the hierarchical clustering .",
    "this result has been tested with high resolution n - body simulation samples ( feng & fang 2004 ) .    in this paper , we investigate the spatial locality of phase space correlations with real sample  the galaxies selected from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc , jarrett et al .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , the spatial locality provides a test of the gaussianity of the initial density perturbations on small scales .",
    "although many tests on the gaussianity of the initial perturbations have been done with the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( e.g. komatsu , et al .",
    "2003 , pando , valls - gabaud & fang , 1998 ) , the comoving scales of these tests are not less than a few mpc .",
    "the spatial locality of the 2mass samples can test the gaussianity to scale as small as about 0.04 h@xmath9 mpc .",
    "second , the distribution of galaxies is biased from the mass field of dark matter .",
    "some bias models assume that the relation between the distribution of galaxies and underlying mass field is stochastic and nonlocal ( e.g. dekel & lahav , 1999 ) .",
    "this mechanism will lead to nonlocality of the galaxy correlation function in phase space , even when the underlying dark matter mass field is spatially localized .",
    "therefore , the spatial locality should be effective in testing the stochasticity and nonlocality of bias models .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    " 2 presents the statistics and dynamics of the spatial locality in phase space . ",
    "3 describes the basic properties of the 2mass galaxy samples with a space - scale decomposition .",
    "the results of the spatial locality of the 2mass galaxy distribution are presented in  4 .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions are be given in  5 .",
    "the cosmic mass density contrast field @xmath40 in @xmath6-space is given by @xmath41 , in @xmath20-space by @xmath42 .",
    "these two descriptions are equivalent , and the set of the bases @xmath43 or @xmath44 are complete and orthogonal . @xmath45 and @xmath16 correspond to , respectively , the coordinate- and momentum - representations of quantum mechanical wavefunctions . to study the statistical and dynamical behavior of the mass field in @xmath34 phase space",
    ", we should describe the field @xmath40 in the wigner representation .",
    "therefore , the phase space analysis of @xmath40 can be performed with the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "the wigner wavefunction is a prototype of the dwt .    for the dwt analysis",
    ", we use the same notation as fang & feng ( 2000 ) or fang & thews ( 1998 ) . in the dwt scheme , there are two sets of base given by 1 . ) scaling functions @xmath46 and 2 . )",
    "wavelets @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in 1-d",
    "space with size @xmath50 , the scaling function @xmath51 is localized in physical space @xmath52 , while wavelet @xmath53 is localized in phase space cell @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "the dwt base in 3-d space is given by a direct product of the 1-d base , i.e. @xmath55 , @xmath56 and volume @xmath57 , the bases @xmath58 are localized in the spatial range @xmath59 and wavenumber range @xmath60 .",
    "the simplest scaling and wavelet are given by @xmath61l/2^{j}$}\\\\             -\\sqrt{2^j / l } & \\mbox{if $ [ l+1/2]l/2^{j } < x < ( l+1)l/2^{j}$}\\\\                        0 & \\mbox{otherwise }                      \\end{array }      \\right . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the so - called haar wavelet .",
    "however , we will not use the haar wavelet in the numerical calculation of  3 and 4 , because the discontinuity of the haar function made it not to be very well localized in the fourier space ( @xmath10-space ) .",
    "we will apply the wavelet of daubechies 4 ( daubechies , 1992 ) , which has much better behavior in @xmath10 space .",
    "the scaling and wavelet of the daubechies 4 in @xmath22- and @xmath10-spaces can be found in the numerical recipes ( press et al 1992 ) and yang et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the properties of the scaling function and wavelet discussed in this section are generally available for either the haar , daubechies or other dwts .",
    "the scaling functions are orthogonormal with respect to index @xmath62 as @xmath63 scaling function @xmath64 actually is a window function for the spatial range @xmath59 . the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) of a density field @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 , and therefore , the mean density in 3-d spatial range of @xmath59 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a uniform field with density equal to unity .",
    "the density field can be expressed by the sfcs as @xmath69 where @xmath70 runs 0 , 1, ... @xmath71 and @xmath72 means all fluctuations on scales less than @xmath73 , and @xmath74 therefore , @xmath75 is the density field smoothed on scale @xmath73 .",
    "the sfcs @xmath76 and @xmath77 are similar to the mass field variables given by count - in - cell .",
    "thus , the two - mode correlation @xmath78 will display the similar features as ordinary two - point correlation function , which generally is not localized for gaussian fields with a @xmath10-dependent fourier power spectrum @xmath18 .",
    "the wavelets @xmath79 are orthogonal with respect to both indexes @xmath80 and @xmath62 @xmath81 the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) of the density contrast field @xmath40 is defined by @xmath82 since the set of the wavelet bases @xmath58 is complete , the density contrast field can be expressed as @xmath83 where each @xmath84 runs 0 , 1 , 2 ... and @xmath70 runs 0 , 1, ... @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the wfcs @xmath85 can be used as the variables of the mass field @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath85 is the fluctuations of the density field around scales @xmath86 with @xmath87 and at the physical area @xmath62 with size @xmath88 . in each dimension",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath85 is given by a superposition of fluctuations in the waveband @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 can play the role as the variables @xmath93 of eq.(2 ) .",
    "we have then @xmath94 as we have emphasized , the locality of the factors @xmath95 and @xmath96 in eq.(10 ) generally are very good approximation for gaussian field .",
    "the factor @xmath97 in eq.(10 ) is the dwt power spectrum of the mass density perturbations ( fang & feng 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath97 is not dependent on @xmath62 , as cosmic mass field is assumed to be randomly uniform .",
    "the spatial locality @xmath96 arises from the phase decoherence given by the superposition of the fourier modes in the band @xmath20 to @xmath98 .",
    "this point can easily be seen from the orthogonal relation eq.(7 ) by taking @xmath99 . for the 1-d case",
    "we have @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the fourier counterpart of @xmath103 .",
    "the last step of deriving eq.(11 ) used the following relation ( fang & thews 1998 ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet .",
    "it is non - zero only within @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "therefore @xmath108 is non - zero only for @xmath109 .",
    "since the factor @xmath110 is always positive , the spatial locality factor @xmath111 of eq.(11 ) basically comes from the average of the phase factor @xmath112 over @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , the phase @xmath115 is uniform distributed in range @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the phase is similar to a randomly uniform distributed .",
    "thus , for a function @xmath117 , we have approximately @xmath118 if @xmath119 , the fourier counterpart of @xmath117 , does not change the average of the phase factor @xmath112 in the range @xmath109",
    ".      the mass field evolution under a self - similarly hierarchical process will not violate the initial spatial locality ( feng & fang 2004 ) .",
    "the correlations between dwt modes at different physical positions are always substantially less than that at the same position . in other words ,",
    "gravitational evolution causes a strong coupling between the phase space modes @xmath120 and @xmath121 with different scales @xmath80 and @xmath122 , but with spatial range of @xmath62 and @xmath123 overlapped .",
    "the coupling between modes at different physical range is very weak .",
    "the factor @xmath96 in the initial gaussian field [ eq.(10 ) ] is memorized during the nonlinear evolution .    the spatial locality can be measured by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is average over the ensemble of variables @xmath85 with @xmath126 for a given @xmath80 .",
    "considering the mass field @xmath65 is randomly uniform , we have @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , eq.(14 ) can also be rewritten as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the two - point correlation function of mass field @xmath65 .",
    "eq.(15 ) is a criterion of the spatial locality with second order statistics",
    ".    one can construct the spatial locality with higher order correlations of the @xmath85 .",
    "for a @xmath130 order statistical criterion , we use statistics as @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 can be any even number . obviously , for gaussian fields .",
    "@xmath134 at @xmath135 , and therefore , @xmath136 at @xmath135 . if @xmath137 at @xmath138 , the field is nonlocally correlated .",
    "therefore , the spatial local evolution is given by @xmath139 eqs.(14 ) and ( 17 ) are the basic statistical criterion s used for testing the spatial locality .      the number density of galaxies @xmath140 are not simply proportional to the mass density @xmath14 of dark matter .",
    "it is biased . the simplest linear model of galaxies bias is given by @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the number density contrast of galaxies , and @xmath143 the bias parameter .",
    "this model implies that the relation between @xmath144 and @xmath45 is deterministic and localized .",
    "it has been argued that the locality assumption is not trivial , and consequently , stochastic and nonlinear bias models have been proposed . in these models , the galaxy field @xmath142 at @xmath6 is not determined only by dark matter field @xmath45 at the same point @xmath6 .",
    "the relation between @xmath144 and @xmath45 is stochastic and non - local . in these models , the two - point correlation function of galaxies @xmath145",
    "is related to the two - point correlation function @xmath146 of dark matter by ( matsubara 1999 ) @xmath147 where @xmath148 describes the nonlocal nature of the bias .",
    "a galaxy at @xmath6 is dependent on the dark matter field @xmath149 with probability proportional to @xmath148 . if @xmath148 is non - zero in the range @xmath150 , the relation between galaxies and dark matter field is nonlocal with size @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the galaxy correlation of phase space modes becomes @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the fourier counterpart of @xmath154 .",
    "@xmath153 is non - zero only in the band @xmath155 .",
    "thus , if @xmath151 is large than @xmath156 , the non - zero range of @xmath153 is limited in @xmath157 or @xmath158 . in this narrow range of @xmath159 , the average of the phase factor @xmath160 can not be zero when @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , even when the underlying field of dark matter is spatially localized as eq.(15 ) , the galaxy clustering with nonlocal bias will not be spatially localized .",
    "hence , if the spatial locality holds for a given scale @xmath162 , the nonlocal size of galaxy bias should not be larger than @xmath156 , i.e. the nonlocal scale @xmath151 will not be larger than that given by the uncertainty relation @xmath163 .",
    "our sample of the 2mass galaxies is 2-d . with the dwt , the projection of 3-d field @xmath164 to 2-d @xmath165",
    "is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are coordinates on sky plane , while @xmath169 stands for the spatial coordinate in redshift direction . in eq.(20 ) , @xmath170 is a scaling function on scale @xmath171 .",
    "hence , if @xmath171 is equal to the depth of the sample in the redshift direction , eq.(20 ) is a projection of a 3-d sample @xmath164 with depth @xmath171 onto a 2-d distribution .",
    "the dwt variables in 2-d analysis is then @xmath172 eq.(21 ) shows @xmath173 is a sampling of @xmath45 by basis @xmath174 , which is mixed from wavelets @xmath175 , @xmath176 and scaling @xmath177 .",
    "since the @xmath178 and @xmath179 are orthogonal with @xmath180 , the dwt is effective in distinguishing the redshift direction .",
    "one can repeat the analysis of feng & fang ( 2004 ) to show that the correlation of the variables @xmath173 will be spatially localized with respect to the position indexes @xmath181 or @xmath182 regardless the projection of the redshift direction .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "the scaling function base @xmath180 counts all galaxies in the redshift direction .",
    "however , the wavelet bases @xmath183 and @xmath184 measure the _ difference _ between the densities of two neighboring cells on scale @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and therefore , the background of the two neighbor cells are cancelled .",
    "the background may cause uncertainty of the shot noise , but it does not contribute to the difference @xmath173 .",
    "thus , if a 3-d mass field is spatially localized , the 2-d variables @xmath173 should satisfy eqs.(14 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "we do not write the superscript @xmath187 below to simplify the notation .",

    "the contamination mainly is from stars .",
    "the reliability of separating stars from extended sources is @xmath196 at @xmath197 , but drops rapidly to @xmath198 at @xmath199 . to avoid this contaminant",
    ", we use a latitude cut of @xmath197 .",
    "we also removed a small number of bright ( @xmath200 ) sources by the parameters of the xsc confusion flag ( @xmath201 ) and visual verification score for source ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "they are identified as non - extended sources including artifacts . moreover , to eliminate duplicate sources and have a uniform sample , we use the parameters @xmath203 and @xmath204 .    to select the range of @xmath191",
    ", we use the standard @xmath205 test to examine the completeness of the sample .",
    "the number counts can be approximated by a power - law as @xmath206 the xsc sources with @xmath207 and @xmath208 are believed to be galaxies with 99% reliability ( maller et al . 2003 ) . for this sample , the index @xmath209 is found to be @xmath210 .",
    "if considering this @xmath209 to be the standard , the completeness of a sample can be estimated by the deviation of @xmath211 from the standard ( afshordi , loh & strauss 2003 ) , i.e. @xmath212    figure 1 shows the number counts @xmath213 and completeness @xmath214 for sample ( 1 ) ( the standard ) of galaxies with @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and sample ( 2 ) with @xmath197 region when @xmath215 .",

    "all nonlocal ( @xmath256 ) correlations are much less than 1 , and practically equal to zero within the error bars . in other words ,",
    "the correlation length in terms of the position index @xmath62 is zero .",
    "the spatial locality is not a surprise on large scales for which the field basically remains gaussian .",
    "however , fig .",
    "3 shows that spatial locality holds on scales as small as @xmath257 degrees .",
    "this result is in contrast with fig .",
    "2 , in which the correlation function @xmath234 at @xmath258 for all @xmath162 is always comparable with that of @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to describe the correlation function by @xmath260 .",
    "one can not conclude that the spatial locality is due to the dynamical evolution because spatial locality can also be given by the gaussianization due to the central limit theorem ( clt ) . according to the clt",
    ", a variable given by a superposition of many independent identical random variables tends to become gaussian .",
    "if we consider that a 2-d field is a superposition of many identical slides of a 3-d field , the 2-d field variables will be gaussianized .",
    "if so , the spatial locality is a trivial result .",
    "however , the 2-d wfc @xmath85 are not subject to the clt .",
    "this is because , as discussed in  2.3",
    "@xmath85 is not a 3-d superposition .",
    "this point can be directly shown with the non - gaussianity of variable @xmath85 .",
    "we plot in figure 4 the one - point distributions of the ensemble of @xmath85 for @xmath242 with @xmath261 - 10 and @xmath262 .",
    "all the distributions of fig .",
    "4 are non - gaussian .",
    "these one - point distributions generally are long tailed , and therefore , the kurtosis of this field is high .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "4 that the non - gaussianity of the one - point distributions is scale - dependent . on large scales @xmath261 and 6 ,",
    "the distribution consists of a gaussian center and a power law tail . on scale",
    "@xmath263 , the gaussian center disappears , and the whole distribution is a power law . on small scales @xmath264 , the distributions still have a power law tail , but the sharp center part appears and grows with @xmath162 .",
    "this means that in most places the perturbations are small ( center part of the one - point distributions ) , but there are rare events with very large perturbations ( long tail ) .",
    "that is , there is no gaussianization of the variable @xmath85 .",
    "the spatial locality does nt arise from the gaussianization of @xmath85 .    in figure 5",
    ", we plot the one - point distributions of the sfcs @xmath76 . these distributions are non - gaussian too .",
    "they have a long - tail towards high density , or high value of @xmath76 .",
    "these distributions are similar to the one - point distributions given by count - in - cell .",
    "this result shows again that both the wfcs and sfcs are highly non - gaussian",
    ". the spatial locality can not be due to the gaussianization , but a remain of the spatial locality of the initial perturbations .      before looking at the spatial locality of the wfc correlation at higher order",

    "the error bars are again the 90% confidence of the 28 samples .",
    "as expected the random samples always show @xmath270 , i.e. there is no correlation . on small scales",
    "@xmath271 , @xmath267 for random sample is little larger than 1 at @xmath272 .",
    "this is because of shot noise , i.e. the mean number per cell on small scales is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2mass galaxy samples show significant non - local correlation @xmath273 for all scales @xmath274 . that is , the correlation length for 4th order statistics of the sfc variables is non - zero .",
    "the correlation is no localized . on large scales",
    "@xmath275 - 4 , the nonlocal correlation of the 2mass galaxy samples is negligible , because the field is still in gaussian on such large scales .",
    "however , the 4@xmath265 order correlation function of the @xmath85 has completely different behavior from the sfc .",
    "similar to eq.(26 ) , we consider a 4th order correlations of the wfcs by @xmath276 where @xmath277 .",

    "7 are again given by the 90% confidence levels as fig .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath281 at @xmath282 for all scales considered .",
    "nevertheless , for all non - local cases @xmath283 , the 2mass samples behave the same as the random samples within the error bars . therefore , the 4@xmath265 order correlation of the wfcs is spatially localized . similar to the second order statistics , the spatial locality of the 4@xmath265 order wfc s correlation is not due to the gaussianization of @xmath85 . at point",
    "@xmath284 , or @xmath285 , the 2mass samples always have much higher value of @xmath279 than that of random samples .",
    "the difference between the wfc s and sfc s 4@xmath265 order correlations can be seen with the hierarchical clustering or linked pair approximation . in this approximation , the 4@xmath265 correlations @xmath286 can be expressed by second order correlations as @xmath287,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath288 is a constant .",
    "the first two terms on the r.h.s . of eq.(28 ) are from unlinked diagrams and the term of @xmath288 comes from non - linear evolution",
    ". obviously , if the second order correlations of the wfcs are spatially localized [ eq.(14 ) ] , the 4@xmath265 and higher order correlations will also be approximately spatially localized if the linked pair approximation holds .",

    "the figure shows that the correlation @xmath309 for the 2mass samples are larger than the random data on the first two data points , but after the third data point , the 2mass samples do not show significant difference from the random data .",
    "therefore , the local scale - scale correlations ( @xmath302 ) are strong",

    "the spatial distance between nearest neighbors are only , respectively , @xmath312 , 0.11 and 0.06 angular degrees .",
    "on the other hand , the sfcs have strong scale - scale correlation on , at least , @xmath313 ( fig . 6 ) . in this sense , the scale - scale correlation is also approximately spatially localized .",
    "the 2-d distribution of 2mass galaxies has been studied using the dwt , in which the sfc @xmath76 is the count - in - cell in physical space , while the wfc @xmath85 is a count - in - cell in phase space .",
    "we find that the statistical properties of the sfc and wfc variables are very different .",
    "the former is non - gaussian and nonlocally correlated , while the later is non - gaussian , but its correlation basically is spatially localized .",
    "that is , the sample has the following statistical behavior in the phase space    * the one - point distribution of @xmath85 is highly non - gaussian on angular scales less than 1@xmath314 , corresponding to @xmath315 h@xmath9 mpc at the median redshift of the sample . * the 2nd and 4th order mode - mode correlations with @xmath85 are always spatially localized .",

    "the scale - scale correlation is also approximately spatially localized .",
    "a direct physical meaning of these results is that the cosmic gravitational instability causes only strong interaction between the modes in different wavebands and in the same spatial area , but is weak for modes in different spatial area .",
    "because the nonlinear evolution of cosmic gravitational clustering has the memory of its initial spatial correlation in the phase space , the observed spatial locality of the 2mass galaxies provides solid evidence for models assuming that the initial perturbations are spatially uncorrelated among phase space modes .",
    "this result is consistent with the assumption that the initial perturbations are gaussian .",
    "although the gaussianity of the initial perturbations on large scales has been extensively tested with the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the test given by the spatial locality is effective to comoving scales as small as @xmath246 0.2 h@xmath9 mpc .",
    "the spatial locality has been studied with samples of ly - alpha forests ( pando , feng & fang , 2001 ) .",
    "since ly - alpha forests refer to weakly non - linear clustering , their spatial locality can be used to rule out the models of initially non - gaussian fields which are non - spatially localized , but can not do so for models of initial non - gaussian which are spatially localized . in this paper ,",
    "the spatial locality is found for sample referring to fully nonlinear regime .",
    "the memory of the spatial locality is based on the halo model , for which an initially gaussian field is necessary . in this sense",
    ", the spatial locality of the 2mass gives stronger support to the initially gaussian assumption than that that of ly - alpha forests .",
    "the one - point distribution of 2mass galaxies ( fig .",
    "3 ) is very different from that given by n - body simulation sample .",
    "the later in nonlinear regime generally is lognormal ( see fig . 6 of feng & fang , 2004 ) , while the former is more complicated ( fig .",
    "this difference indicates that galaxy distribution is biased with respect to the underlying dark matter field .",
    "nevertheless , the galaxy distribution is also highly spatially localized .",
    "this result indicates that relationship between @xmath140 and @xmath14 should be localized in phase space .",
    "that is , the stochasticity and nonlocality of the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath14 are limited in the cell of phase space . for a structure consisting of perturbations on scales",
    "@xmath20 to @xmath2 , the nonlocal size in the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath14 should not be larger than @xmath317",
    ". otherwise , the galaxy bias will violate the spatial locality of the galaxy distribution even when the underlying field is spatial localized .",
    "hence , from the 2mass galaxies we can conclude that the stochasticity and nonlocality of the bias relation between @xmath140 and @xmath14 probably are no more than that given by the uncertainty relation @xmath318 ."
