    "the bright x - ray nova a062000 ( v616 mon ) was discovered when it erupted in 1975 @xcite .",
    "observations obtained after its return to quiescence revealed that a062000 is an interacting binary system with a k star donating mass to a compact star via an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "early fits to the radial velocity variations of the k star gave a semi - amplitude of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 , which , when combined with the orbital period ( @xmath7 hr ) , yielded a mass function @xmath8  @xmath3 .",
    "the mass function equals the minimum dynamical mass of the compact star .",
    "since the mass function for a062000 is greater than the theoretical maximum mass for a neutron star , a062000 became a strong candidate for a black hole binary @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations have refined the velocity semi - amplitude and determined the mass ratio of the binary : @xmath9 km s@xmath6 and @xmath10 ( marsh , robinson & wood 1994 ; orosz et al .",
    "1994 found similar binary parameters ) . with these values ,",
    "the masses of the stars are @xmath11  @xmath3  and @xmath12  @xmath3 , lacking only a determination of the orbital inclination to be fully determined .",
    "one method for obtaining the orbital inclination of a062000 is to measure the ellipsoidal variations of the roche - lobe - filling k star .",
    "two studies of the ellipsoidal variations have resulted in non - overlapping estimates of the inclination and , consequently , non - overlapping estimates of the mass of the compact star .",
    "haswell et al .  ( 1993 ) fit models including a roche - lobe - filling star and an accretion disk to simultaneous ubvr light curves of a062000 and found an inclination range for @xmath13 = 0.067 of @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to a compact star mass of @xmath15  @xmath3  ( the compact star masses given here and elsewhere in this manuscript were calculated by us using the mass function determination from marsh , robinson & wood 1994 ) .",
    "@xcite fit a k - band light curve of a062000 with a model including only the lobe - filling star and derived a best - fit inclination of 37@xmath16 , with a range of inclinations @xmath17",
    "( 90% confidence limits for @xmath13 = 0.067 ; their fig .  2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath18 = 14.2  @xmath3 , and a range of @xmath19  @xmath3 .",
    "all authors agree that the compact star should be a black hole .",
    "the orbital light curves of a062000 have shown clear evidence that the ellipsoidal variations are distorted : the light curve minima and maxima have varied in relative height and depth , the light curve minima have on occasion shown sharp features rather than smooth troughs , and the asymmetry between the two peaks has reversed ( haswell 1996 and sources therein ) .",
    "the ellipsoidal variations can be distorted by star spots on the k star ; by a non - axisymmetric distribution of light across the accretion disk , such as the bright spot where the mass stream impacts the accretion disk ; by superhumps caused by a precessing , elliptical accretion disk ; and by dilution of the star light by non - variable flux from other components of the binary system , such as an axisymmetric accretion disk .",
    "the presence of variable sources of flux in the system can confuse attempts to isolate the ellipsoidal component of the variations , and if a non - varying flux is present in the binary system but not in the models , the models will underestimate the true amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations and , in turn , underestimate the orbital inclination . the difference between the derived inclinations for a062000 stems in part from uncertainty about the magnitude of these distortions .",
    "the light curve of a062000 has been monitored at r and i wavelengths ( e.g. , leibowitz , hemar & orio 1998 ) , but few observations have been published at longer wavelengths . since the contribution of the k star to the observed flux is maximized in the near - infrared , that wavelength region provides a good window to target the ellipsoidal modulation . in order to investigate the remaining uncertainties concerning the mass of its compact star and to measure the long - term behavior of its orbital light curve ,",
    "we have reobserved the orbital light curve of a062000 in the j , h and k bandpasses .",
    "this paper reports the results of our observations .",
    "we observed a062000 on 1995 december 15  17 , 1996 january 27  29 and 1996 december 7  12 on the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory using rokcam , a near - infrared imaging camera @xcite . in all three observing runs",
    ", we observed extensively in the h filter ( 1.45  1.85  @xmath20 m ) , where our s / n was maximized , and we supplemented these data with observations in the thermal k ( 2.05  2.4  @xmath20 m ) in 1996 january and in the j - band ( 1.1  1.4  @xmath20 m ) in 1996 december .",
    "the dates and total exposure times of the observations are summarized in table  [ tab_logobs ] .",
    "individual exposure times were 20 seconds in j and h and 10 seconds in k , with telescope nods between integrations to sample the variable sky background .",
    "after subtracting sky and dark current , we calibrated the images using dome flats ( constructed from images taken with the dome lights off subtracted from images taken with the lights on ) .",
    "we aligned the individual frames and coadded them in groups of four , from which we extracted the instrumental magnitudes of a062000 and three nearby comparison stars .",
    "the positions of the comparison stars relative to a062000 and their nir colors are given in table  [ tab_stars ] .",
    "the two brighter comparison stars were averaged and used to correct the observations for seeing and extinction variations .",
    "the third , fainter star is comparable in brightness to a062000 in the near - infrared .",
    "we used the scatter in its measurements to assign an uncertainty to the relative photometry in each filter on each night .",
    "we flux calibrated the h and k data using observations of four standard stars from 1996 january 27 @xcite .",
    "the j - band observations were flux calibrated using a single standard star observed on 1996 december 8 ; the uncertainty in the j - band flux calibration was estimated by using the same standard star to calculate a h - band calibration and comparing that result to the calibration from 1996 january 27 .",
    "because of the paucity of k - band observations of the a062000 field , the transformation equations for each filter were fit with a fixed extinction coefficient @xcite and no color terms .",
    "the mean colors for each observing run are shown in table  [ tab_colors ] .",
    "the mean h magnitude of the a062000 lightcurve was stable over the one - year baseline of our observations , changing by less than 0.05 mag . in the final step , we converted the data from magnitudes to fluxes @xcite .",
    "the observations from each run were combined into mean light curves using the linear ephemeris of @xcite . the combined fluxes and error bars were determined from weighted means of the data , where the weights were based on the uncertainties assigned each night from the scatter about the mean for the third field star .",
    "the bin sizes in the combined light curves are 0.01 in orbital phase for j and h and 0.05 for k , corresponding to time intervals of 4.65 min and 23.3 min , respectively .",
    "the orbital phases conform to the standard convention : phase 0 corresponds to inferior conjunction of the k star there is no substantial drift in the phasing of the light curve relative to the 1986 ephemeris ( nor with respect to the refined ephemeris of orosz et al .",
    "1994 ; the two orbital solutions differ by an amount smaller than the bin size of our points ) : the light curve minima occur at phases 0 and 0.5 , and the maxima at phases 0.25 and 0.75 .",
    "the h - band light curves of a062000 are shown in figure  [ fig_a0620h ] , and the observations in j from 1996 december and in k from 1996 january are shown in figure  [ fig_a0620jk ] .",
    "the light curves all show an asymmetric , double - humped modulation .",
    "there were small fluctuations over the orbit from one observation to the next , but there was no gross variability in the shape or overall flux of the h light curve over the one - year course of our observations .",
    "the minimum at @xmath21 = 0.5 is deeper than the primary minimum at @xmath21 = 0 and the peak at @xmath21 = 0.75 higher than the peak at @xmath21 = 0.25 in all of the h - band light curves , and the same appears to be true in the ( noisier ) k light curve .",
    "the j - band light curve is too poorly sampled to determine the relative amplitudes of the peaks and troughs .",
    "the peaks and troughs in the data are smooth , showing no evidence of the sharp dips seen in b light curves circa 19861989 @xcite .",
    "the shape of the light curves is very similar to that of a k - band light curve obtained in 1990 by @xcite .",
    "the phasing of the light curve peaks and troughs and the sense of the asymmetry in the peaks is the same in both observations .",
    "our mean k and ( j  k ) colors are also close to the colors they found .",
    "the shapes of the near - infrared light curves of a062000 are generally consistent with ellipsoidal modulation in a system of moderate to high inclination , but there are two clear deviations from a pure ellipsoidal modulation . first , there are small fluctuations ( @xmath220.05  0.1  mjy ) among the three observations in the amplitudes of the peaks relative to the troughs , indicating a variable source of flux in addition to the ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the second deviation is the unequal maxima , which an ellipsoidal variation can not produce .",
    "the bright spot is a plausible source for this asymmetry .",
    "it is seen in doppler tomograms of the accretion disk in a062000 @xcite and would be expected to boost the peak at @xmath21 = 0.75 relative to the @xmath21 = 0.25 peak , as we observe .",
    "superhumps from a precessing , non - circular disk or star spots on the k star could also cause asymmetries but , as we will show , they are less plausible sources for the asymmetries in our light curves .",
    "we modeled the near - infrared light curves of a062000 with a rewritten , updated version of the light curve synthesis code described in @xcite .",
    "the code simulates the light curves of binary systems and includes the equipotential geometry , limb and gravity darkening for the stars , and a limb - darkened , flared accretion disk with a bright spot on its edge and top surface .",
    "a significant improvement to the code is the use of specific intensities and quadratic limb darkening coefficients for cool stars obtained from fits to model stellar atmospheres of late - type stars ( allard & hauschildt 1995 ; the fits to the model atmospheres are presented in froning 1999b ) .",
    "we fit three sets of models to the a062000 light curves . in the first set we assumed that only the k star contributes to the observed flux . for the second set we added an accretion disk with a bright spot on its edge .",
    "the third set was a series of models to estimate the effect of a non - varying source of diluting flux on the derived orbital inclinations .",
    "we modeled the h light curves only ; the j and k data are of lower quality and do not warrant detailed modeling .",
    "we initially assumed that the k star is the only source of the observed flux .",
    "we assumed that the asymmetry in the observed light curve is caused by extra flux added to the peak at @xmath21 = 0.75 and , to avoid this extra flux , we fit the models to the light curves only over phases from @xmath21 = 0 to 0.51 .",
    "we generated model light curves of the k star , varying each of the parameters that affect the shape of the ellipsoidal modulation in turn , and fit the light curves to the observed data by least squares .",
    "the parameters that affect this model are : the orbital inclination , @xmath23 , the mass ratio , @xmath13 , the temperature of the k star at the pole , @xmath24 , the quadratic limb - darkening coefficients and the gravity darkening coefficient , @xmath25 .",
    "we varied the inclination from @xmath23 = 1@xmath16  89@xmath16 in 1@xmath16 steps and the k star temperature from @xmath24 = 4000  4500  k in increments of 100  k. the mass ratio in a062000 is known to be @xmath13 = 0.067 @xcite .",
    "we calculated models for this mass ratio but also for @xmath13 = 0.056 , 0.083 and 0.10 to check the dependence of our results on mass ratio .",
    "the limb darkening was modeled using quadratic limb darkening coefficients obtained from the model stellar atmospheres discussed above .",
    "we calculated models for gravity darkening coefficients of 0.05 and 0.08 @xcite and we assumed that the k star fills its roche lobe .",
    "figure  [ fig_mod1 ] shows the best - fit models for each of the h - band light curves .",
    "the parameters for the models are given in table  [ tab_fits ] .",
    "for the 1996 december light curve , the best - fit model for @xmath13 = 0.067 has an inclination of @xmath23 = 44@xmath16 ; for the 1996 january light curve , @xmath26 gives the best fit ; and for the 1995 december light curve , models with 43@xmath16 ",
    "45@xmath16 give good fits .",
    "the models are largely insensitive to variations in the mass ratio and are only weakly dependent on the temperature of the k star and the value of the gravity darkening coefficient .",
    "the best fits were typically obtained for @xmath24 = 4100  k and @xmath25 = 0.08 .",
    "more important , changes in these parameters had virtually no effect on the value of the best - fit inclination . for the 1996 january light curve , for example , the reduced @xmath27 of the best fits for each combination of the other parameters tested range from @xmath28 = 1.06  1.58 , but the inclinations for these models vary only from @xmath23 = 38@xmath16  41@xmath16 . similarly , the models calculated for the 1996 december light curve had @xmath28 between 2.62 and 3.01 and inclinations from @xmath23 = 45@xmath16  50@xmath16 , while for the 1995 december light curve , @xmath28 = 1.13  1.18 and @xmath23 = 43@xmath16  48@xmath16 .",
    "if the k star is the sole contributor to the near - infrared emission from @xmath21 = 0  0.51 , then the orbital inclination in a062000 is @xmath23 = 38@xmath16  45@xmath16 ( @xmath23 = 38@xmath16  50@xmath16 for the extreme range of parameter values ) .",
    "this range is consistent with the results of @xcite , who found a best fit to their k light curve of @xmath23 = 37@xmath16 for @xmath13 = 0.067 and a 90% confidence interval of @xmath29 30@xmath16 ",
    "45@xmath16 for that mass ratio ( their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the assumption that the modulation of the light curve at these orbital phases is purely ellipsoidal is not correct , however .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath21 = 0.25 peak relative to the light curve minima is smaller in the 1996 january light curve than in 1995 december or 1996 december light curves .",
    "this leads to a lower value for the orbital inclination based on the 1996 january data ( @xmath26 ) and a range of possible inclinations ( 38@xmath16  41@xmath16 ) that does not overlap those determined from the 1995/1996 december light curves ( @xmath23 = 43@xmath16  50@xmath16 ) .",
    "this change in the amplitude of the modulation even at @xmath30 indicates that there is some source of variable contamination of the ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "it also gives a measure of the uncertainty in any determination of the inclination based on just one observation epoch : the inclinations derived from our three light curves have a range of 7@xmath16 . in summary ,",
    "models including only the effect of ellipsoidal variations of the k star give a lower limit to the inclination of @xmath0 and show that there is a variable distortion of the ellipsoidal variations even at @xmath30 .",
    "we next modeled the light curves over the full binary orbit , adding an accretion disk and a bright spot to the k star .",
    "we have complete orbital coverage only in the h band , so we can not constrain system parameters such as the temperature of the accretion disk and bright spot with our models .",
    "rather , our goal was to find simple models with reasonable parameter values that fit the observed light curves in order to determine the range of possible values for the orbital inclination .    since the derived orbital inclinations do not depend strongly on the mass ratio , the temperature of the k star , nor the gravity darkening coefficient , we fixed their values at @xmath13 = 0.067 , @xmath24 = 4100  k and @xmath25 = 0.08 .",
    "the inner radius of the accretion disk was fixed at 0.001  r@xmath31 and the outer radius at 0.5  r@xmath31 , which is the outer radius in visible light found by @xcite . to allow for a beamed bright spot on the disk rim , we set the flare half - angle of the disk to a small but non - zero value of 1@xmath32 .",
    "the bright spot also extends onto the top surface of the disk from 0.45  0.5  r@xmath31 @xcite . since the bright spot is not eclipsed and since the disk has only a small flare , the spot component on the top of the disk merely adds to the constant disk flux and is otherwise irrelevant .",
    "the bright spot and accretion disk were each assumed to emit as single - temperature blackbodies , with the linear limb - darkening coefficients for the accretion disk obtained from @xcite .",
    "previous observations of a062000 in quiescence have found no evidence for significant irradiation of the k star by the disk , so we did not include irradiation in our models .",
    "the parameters we varied were : the orbital inclination , @xmath23 , the temperature of the accretion disk , @xmath33 , the temperature of the bright spot , @xmath34 , the azimuthal position of the spot on the disk , @xmath35 and the azimuthal full width of the spot , @xmath36 .",
    "we varied the inclination from @xmath23 = 1@xmath16  89@xmath16 , t@xmath37 from 2000  k ",
    "5000  k , t@xmath38 from 5000  k ",
    "25,000  k , @xmath35 from 80@xmath16  115@xmath16 ( measured with respect to the line connecting the centers of the stars and increasing in the direction of the orbital motion ) and @xmath36 from 5@xmath16  15@xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig_mod2 ] shows the h light curves and the models with the lowest @xmath27 for the parameter values we tested .",
    "the output model parameters are given in table  [ tab_fits ] .",
    "the fits demonstrate that simple models incorporating ellipsoidal variations from the k star and a two - component  constant flux plus a beamed bright spot  accretion disk can fully account for the near - infrared light curves of a062000 .",
    "we reiterate that the models summarized above are not intended to provide real constraints on the properties of the accretion disk ( the temperature of the bright spot , for example , is dependent on its assumed size and on the assumed temperatures of the k star and the accretion disk ) .",
    "moreover , the fits presented above are definitely not unique .",
    "virtually any model with @xmath39 will fit the light curves equally well if @xmath33 is increased with inclination .",
    "for example , a model with @xmath40 and @xmath33 = 2000  k fits the 1996 january light curve as well as the model with @xmath41 and @xmath33 = 5000  k shown in figure  [ fig_mod2 ] .",
    "our light curves show no evidence of an eclipse , which does set an upper limit to the inclination . for the assumed disk size ,",
    "@xmath42 = 0.5  r@xmath31 , we found that inclinations above 75@xmath16 introduced eclipse features in the models inconsistent with the data .",
    "marsh , robinson & wood ( 1994 ) found a similar limit , @xmath43 , based on the lack of observed rotational disturbance in the h@xmath44 emission line .",
    "our agreement with their upper limit is reassuring but not unexpected , as we used their values for the mass ratio and accretion disk radius in our models .",
    "the sense of the asymmetry of the h - band light curve and the orbital phasing of the light curve peaks was stable over the one year covered by our observations .",
    "this long - term stability argues against a precessing , non - circular disk or star spots as sources of the asymmetry in the light curve peaks , as both are likely to produce a variable asymmetry .",
    "when the asymmetry is modeled by a bright spot on the edge of the disk , both the phase and the extent of the bright spot are the same in all three h - band light curves and , with less confidence , in the k - band light curve : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these results strongly support identifying the bright spot as the source of the extra flux at @xmath21 = 0.75 .",
    "the location of the bright spot in our models is not the same as the location of the spot in the doppler maps of @xcite , who found @xmath47 ( their figure 7 ) .",
    "the position of a bright spot as seen in optical line emission will not necessarily coincide with the location of peak spot emission in the near - infrared ( see , e.g. , littlefair et al.2000 , froning et al .",
    "1999 ) ; the difference between the two suggests that the near - infrared bright spot emission in a062000 originates downstream from the initial mass stream impact point .",
    "since there is a direct tradeoff between extra constant flux from the accretion disk ( or any other source ) and the orbital inclination inferred from the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations , we ran a final set of models to determine how the inclination changes as disk flux is added to the light curve . to do this",
    ", we fit a k star model ( t@xmath48 = 4100  k , @xmath25 = 0.08 ) to the 1996 january data and added increasing amounts of disk flux , specified in the light curve synthesis program as a fraction of the total light curve flux at @xmath21 = 0.25 .",
    "table  [ tab_third ] shows the derived orbital inclination as the disk contribution increases .",
    "for no disk contribution , we recover the 38@xmath16 inclination found in section  [ sec_star ] .",
    "to allow orbital inclinations approaching 75@xmath16  the upper limit set by the lack of eclipses  the disk would need to be contribute 55% of the h - band flux .",
    "table  [ tab_third ] also shows that if the accretion disk contribution in the h - band is low , large fluctuations in the disk flux are needed to explain the change in the amplitude of the @xmath21 = 0.25 peak discussed in section  [ sec_star ] : the 67@xmath16 difference in the inclinations of our secondary star model fits to the three h light curves implies fluctuations of 2025% in the contaminating flux at the @xmath21 = 0.25 peak .",
    "based on our fits to the h - band light curves , we can constrain the inclination in a062000 to @xmath49 . the upper limit on the inclination",
    "is quite strict , as light curve models with @xmath50 show both primary and secondary eclipse features not seen in the data",
    ". the lower limit on the inclination is also a fairly strict limit .",
    "the amplitude of the light curve modulation was larger in 1996 december and 1995 december than in 1996 january , indicating that the 38@xmath16 lower limit on the inclination derived from the latter is a probable underestimate of the true binary inclination caused by dilution of the ellipsoidal modulation by an accretion disk flux component .    from determinations of the orbital period , mass ratio and radial velocity semi - amplitude of the k star , @xcite derived a mass @xmath11  @xmath3  for the compact star in a0620 - 00 .",
    "combined with our limits on the inclination , this limits the mass of the compact star to lie in the range @xmath51  @xmath3 .",
    "the lower limit is close to , but remains larger than , the maximum mass of a uniformly rotating neutron star with the stiffest equation of state , @xmath523.2  @xmath3  @xcite , and it is well above the maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star , 1.8  2.5  @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a sharp dip in their ubvr light curves of a0620 - 00 as an eclipse of the k star by a large accretion disk ( at or near the maximum radius for a circular disk inside the roche lobe around the compact star ) .",
    "if this identification is correct , the inclination of a0620 - 00 is @xmath53 and the mass of the compact star is @xmath54  @xmath3(using the inclination range found by haswell et al .",
    "1993 for @xmath13 = 0.067 and masses from the marsh , robinson & wood 1994 equation for @xmath18 given above ) . @xcite also invoked a large accretion disk to model 1986 spectroscopic observations of a062000 .",
    "@xcite explained the large disk and the grazing eclipse in the context of a non - circular , precessing accretion disk model for a062000 : as the orientation of the non - circular disk changes over the long ( @xmath55 ) precession period , eclipses appear and disappear and superhumps move through the light curve , causing changes in the shape of the light curves as was , indeed , seen from 1981  1989 in a062000 .",
    "@xcite found that a062000 exhibited slow fluctuations in its mean optical brightness between 1991 and 1995 with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.3  0.4 mag in the r band .",
    "they did not find any periodicities in the fluctuations .",
    "specifically , they found no evidence of a superhump period nor of a beat period between the superhump and orbital periods .",
    "the shape of the orbital light curve varied somewhat with brightness , but the sense of the asymmetry between the two peaks never reversed .",
    "there is , therefore , no evidence for current or recent superhumps in a062000 .",
    "@xcite concluded that , after 1989 the accretion disk had shrunk below the radius necessary to trigger the tidal interactions that drive superhumps .",
    "the most serious challenge to the superhump model comes from @xcite , who re - analyzed the 1986 observations of @xcite and concluded that both the 1986 and the 1991/92 data sets  which straddle the observations of @xcite  are consistent with a smaller accretion disk , @xmath42 = 0.5  0.6 @xmath56 , one too small to drive superhumps .",
    "they note , however , that their accretion disk radius is based on the radius of h@xmath44 emission and could be smaller than the radius of the optically thick accretion disk used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also narrowly constrained the derived inclination for a062000 to @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath57  @xmath3 .",
    "their best - fit value for @xmath13 = 0.067 was @xmath23 = 37@xmath16 , which corresponds to @xmath18 = 14.2  @xmath3 .",
    "their analysis was predicated on the assumption that the accretion disk does not contaminate the k - band flux from the k star . to test this",
    ", @xcite obtained a k - band spectrum of a062000 to which they fit scaled template spectra of stars of known spectral type . from this , they concluded that the k star provides 75@xmath5817% of the k - band flux .",
    "they noted that a 27% accretion disk contribution ( their maximum likely disk fraction ) would increase the minimum inclination in a062000 by 7@xmath16 and decrease the mass of the compact star by 3.6  @xmath3 .",
    "if the accretion disk does contribute @xmath5225% of the near - infrared flux , our three observations would indicate an inclination of @xmath59  53@xmath16 and a corresponding mass of @xmath60  @xmath3 .    to determine the contribution of the disk to the infrared spectrum , @xcite fit the template spectra to just the @xmath61 m @xmath4co(2,0 ) bandhead .",
    "the use of this feature to estimate the disk contribution is problematic for several reasons .",
    "first , the co molecular line strengths are both temperature and gravity dependent ( e.g. , kleinman & hall 1986 ) .",
    "while the spectrum of the k star in a062000 is clearly inconsistent with that of a giant star ( luminosity class iii ) , its effective gravity could still be significantly lower than the gravity of a main - sequence star @xcite .",
    "@xcite used only dwarf stars for their template spectra , so their results could not distinguish gravity dependent changes in the @xmath62 m @xmath4co(2,0 ) line strength .",
    "second , observations of cataclysmic variables have shown that in some systems , @xmath4co absorption is weaker relative to the strengths of the atomic absorption lines than expected for their donor star spectral types @xcite .",

    "the reason for these abnormalities in the co absorption line strengths is not yet understood .",

    "the measurements by @xcite do not settle the question of how much flux the disk contributes to the light curve of a0620 - 00 at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the orbital inclination could , therefore , be significantly higher than the lower limit set by the ellipsoidal variations ( @xmath39 ) and the mass of the compact star much less than the upper limit ( @xmath63  @xmath3 ) .",

    "there were no gross changes in the morphology of the light curves over a one year period from 1995 december to 1996 december .",
    "the mean infrared colors and the shape of the light curve are also the same as observed in 1990 january .",
    "there were no sharp dips in the light curve nor reversals of the asymmetry between the two humps as were seen in observations circa 1986  1989 .",
    "the light curves are consistent with ellipsoidal variations from the k star plus beamed flux from a spot on the accretion disk .",
    "a precessing disk is an unlikely source of light curve modulation during the observation period .",
    "star spots are also ruled out unless the spot is fixed in location and size on the k star surface .",
    "3 . based on fits to the lower peak in the light curve ( between @xmath21 = 0 and 0.51 ) , the minimum inclination in a062000 is @xmath64 . from the absence of eclipse features in the light curves , models including an accretion disk of radius @xmath65 give an upper limit to the inclination of @xmath1 .",
    "the mass of the compact star in a062000 is @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "ellipsoidal variations provide only a lower limit to the inclination of non - eclipsing binary systems when the contribution of the accretion disk is unknown . a previous attempt to determine the relative contribution of the accretion disk and k star to the near - infrared flux used the strength of the @xmath62 m @xmath4co(2,0 )",
