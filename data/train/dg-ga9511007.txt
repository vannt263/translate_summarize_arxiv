    "many theorems are much easier to prove for khler manifolds than for symplectic manifolds . indeed , some are only known to be true in the khler case , and others are known to be true only in the khler case . therefore , an important question with a rich history is the extent to which the symplectic category is larger than the khler category .",
    "many interesting examples of non - khler symplectic manifolds have been constructed .",
    "for example , in 1971 thurston constructed a compact four dimensional symplectic manifold which is not khler @xcite . in 1984 , d.  mcduff used thurston s example and symplectic blowups to construct a compact ten dimensional _ simply connected _ non - khler symplectic manifold @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to show that these manifolds do not admit khler structures ; they each have an odd betti number which is odd , and their cohomology does not have the hard lefshetz property . in 1994 , among many other examples , r. gompf constructed a symplectic form on a gompf - mrowka manifold , a four dimensional simply connected symplectic manifold which does not admit any complex structure @xcite @xcite .",

    "the important question is to what extent do these symmetries force symplectic manifolds to admit invariant khler structures .    on the one hand , it is easy to find a non - khler symplectic manifolds with a hamiltonian group action .",
    "let @xmath0 be a symplectic manifold which does not admit a khler structure .",
    "the action of @xmath10 on @xmath11 given by @xmath12 ) = ( m , [ \\lambda x , y])$ ] is hamiltonion , and @xmath13 does not admit an invariant khler structure . however , this example is not very interesting .",
    "the components of the fixed point set and the reduced spaces are themselves symplectic manifolds which do not admit khler structures .",
    "more interestingly , e.  lerman used mcduff s example to construct a compact twelve dimensional simply connected symplectic manifold and a hamiltonian circle action on it with an isolated fixed point @xcite .",
    "the manifold is not khler because it has an odd dimensional odd betti number . in this example , some of the fixed point sets and some of the reduced spaces are themselves non - khler .    on the other hand , sufficiently large symmetries can force a symplectic manfiods to be khler .",
    "let a torus @xmath5 act effectively on a compact symplectic manifold @xmath14 in a hamiltonian fashion .",
    "t.  delzant shows that if the dimension of @xmath5 is half the dimension of @xmath0 , then @xmath14 admits a @xmath5 invariant compatible complex structure @xcite .",
    "similarly , if @xmath0 is four dimensional and @xmath5 is one dimensional , then y.  karshon shows that @xmath14 admits a @xmath5 invariant compatible complex structure @xcite .",

    ", we develop a new criterion for showing that a symplectic manifold does not admit an compatible invariant complex structure , and use this to show that our example does not admit any invariant khler structure .",
    "moreover , using these techniques it is possible to find many other symplectic manifolds with similar properties .",
    "this example solves several outstanding existence problems .",
    "for instance , it shows that a symplectic manifold with a hamiltonian torus action need not admit an invariant khler structure even if all the reduced spaces are khler .",
    "it is the first known example with isolated fixed points .",
    "this example is sharp in the sense that it is not possible to find either an example with a lower dimensional symplectic manifold , or an example with a larger hamiltonian torus action ( relative to the symplectic manifold ) .",
    "additionally , this manifold is simply connected , and the action is quasi - free .",
    "however , the most important implication of this paper is that the category of symplectic manifolds with hamiltonian torus actions is much richer than the category of khler manifolds with compatible hamiltonian torus actions . in recent years",
    "their has been a degree of convergence between the study of symplectic manifolds with hamiltonian group actions , and the study of algebraic varieties with algebraic group actions .",
    "some mathematicians had feared  or hoped  that traditional hamiltonian techniques might be rendered obsolete .",
    "after all , more powerful techniques are often available in algebraic geometry .",
    "however , i believe that this family of examples shows that khler manifolds , far from being the rule , are merely an interesting special case  even among highly symmetric symplectic manifolds .    using the ideas of this paper , c. woodward shows that even the symplectic analogue of spherical varieties need not be khler @xcite .",
    "he finds an alternate construction for my example and for several others , using symplectic cuts . in so doing",
    ", he shows that they in fact admit a multiplicity free hamiltonian @xmath15 action .",
    "f.  knop has independently constructed other symplectic manifolds which admit a multiplicity free hamiltonian @xmath16 action , where @xmath16 is a compact nonabelian group .",

    "i am happy to have this opportunity to thank yael karshon for all that she taught me about symplectic geometry .",
    "in particular , my ideas about x - rays , two torus actions on six manifolds , and symplectic toric manifolds all grew out of joint projects with her , and made this paper possible .",
