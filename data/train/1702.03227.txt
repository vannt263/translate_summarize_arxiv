    "[ eq : tau ] , possibly due to the highly non - linear effects of radiative transfer .",
    "this underestimation for @xmath0co is in good agreement with previously reported results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the impact of the crir .",
    "overall , as the crir increases ( from top to bottom in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] ) , the mass estimates get more accurate and the relative differences between the four different lines transitions for a given snapshot decrease . interestingly , for @xmath0co the inferred masses seem to increase with an increasing crir , although the actual mass of co in the filament ( obtained from the simulation data directly ) is decreasing .",
    "we attribute this effect to the fact that due to the higher destruction rate of co for higher crirs , @xmath0co is less abundant in the outer part of the filament ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coprofile ] ) .",
    "this reduces the self - absorption along the los and increases the inferred mass ( see section  [ sec : subtherm ] ) .",
    "co normalised to the total hydrogen number density at @xmath20 = 300 kyr for the filaments with a parallel magnetic field and three different crirs .",
    "the @xmath0co number density in the outer parts decreases with increasing crir due to the enhanced dissociation of co by crs . ]    finally , comparing the middle and right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] , we find that the magnetic field configuration has very little influence on the actual mass . we attribute this to the fact that we cover the entire extent of the filament ( see fig .  [ fig : coldens ] ) , and thus the total mass contained in the considered regions is approximately constant is due to the fact that in this run we made use of sink particles @xcite , i.e. some amount of the gas was removed from the simulation grid and stored in these sink particles which only interact gravitationally with the gas .",
    "this was necessary since  due to the rapid collapse of the filament  the gas very quickly reaches very high densities . in case",
    "no sink particles were used , this would prevent us from simulating the evolution over a few 100 kyr . ] .",
    "in contrast to that , the radial profiles are strongly affected by the field configuration @xcite , which in turn could affect the emission properties and thus the _ derived _ masses . however , due to the large differences between the four different co lines ( for an individual snapshot ) , it is difficult to infer an impact of the radial profile ( and thus the field configuration ) on the observed line emission masses .",
    "the dust masses are even less affected , since the continuum emission remains optically thin .",
    "next , we determine the fwhms of the filaments for the same runs as in the previous section .",
    "in the two upper rows of fig .  [",
    "fig : profiles ] , we plot the normalised radial profile of the integrated intensity of the @xmath5 = 1  0 transition of both @xmath0co and c@xmath1o and the inferred total gas column density for the runs with a crir of 1 @xmath24 10@xmath64 s@xmath8 at @xmath20 = 300 kyr , i.e. for the same maps as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coldens ] .",
    "the column density is inferred using for the parallel ( perpendicular ) magnetic field case .",
    "we note that for the corresponding @xmath5 = 2  1 transitions qualitatively very similar results are obtained .",
    "some interesting results can be read off .",
    "first , the profiles of the integrated intensity are wider than that of the corresponding column density maps .",
    "this is due to the fact that the opacity correction increases the central column density , thus decreasing the apparent width .",
    "secondly , the profiles obtained for @xmath0co are wider than that for c@xmath1o , which we attribute to the higher optical depth of the @xmath0co transitions . finally , both the intensity and the column density profiles for @xmath0co show a dip towards the centre of the filament , which we attribute to various los effects ( see section  [ sec : los ] . )",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_width ] , we plot the fwhms inferred from the column density profiles for both the line and continuum emission for all snapshots considered .",
    "the order of the snapshots is identical to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] .",
    "the black line shows the actual fwhm , the black dots that obtained from the dust emission maps , and the red , blue , and green dots those from the line emission maps for the various values of @xmath43 used ( section  [ sec : extemp ] ) .",
    "similar to the masses , the fwhms obtained via line emission observations depend only weakly on the chosen @xmath43 ( variations by a few 10% ) .",
    "however , we do not find the systematic differences between the @xmath5 = 1  0 and @xmath5 = 2  1 transitions . the results also confirm the findings in fig .  [",
    "fig : profiles ] that @xmath0co gives somewhat larger values for the fwhm than c@xmath1o .",
    "furthermore , for an actual fwhm around 0.1 pc ( compare table  [ tab : models ] ) , the inferred fwhms match reasonably well within a factor of 2 or less , although  except for the highest crir  the values for @xmath0co tend to slightly overestimate the actual fwhm ( black line ) .        considering the upper middle , upper right , and middle right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_width ] , we find that these filaments have rather small fwhms ( @xmath67 0.05 pc ; see also table  [ tab : models ] ) . for this reason , throughout the paper we will refer to them as _",
    "condensed filaments_. most interestingly , for these condensed filaments the fwhms inferred from both co isotopes are in general well above the actual fwhms .",
    "this indicates a potential problem of line emission observations to accurately measure very narrow filament widths .    as can be read off from table  [ tab : models ] , small fwhms seem to preferentially occur for low crirs and/or a perpendicular magnetic field configuration .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of a reduced pressure support against radial collapse of the filament : for low crirs the thermal pressure is lower due to the reduced amount of cr heating ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : temp ] ) , and for perpendicular magnetic fields no radial magnetic pressure gradient is present ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , since the profiles for the integrated intensities are even wider ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) and thus possibly even more inaccurate , we strongly suggest to infer filament widths from the opacity corrected column density maps instead of the intensity maps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , considering the effect of the crir ( left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_width ] ) , we find that the inferred fwhms decrease with an increasing crir , and for crir = the fwhms are systematically underestimated . we attribute this to the fact that for a high crir , co is dissociated in the outer parts of the filament ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coprofile ] ) leading to a ( apparent ) smaller width .",
    "we note that instead of directly determining the fwhm from the profiles , we also tried to fit a plummer or gaussian function to the profile and subsequently determine the fwhm from the fit .",
    "however , this does not result in better matches , even when excluding the inner part of the profile from the fit , where self - absorption is taking place .",
    "this is due to the wings of the profiles , which do not have a gaussian or plummer - like shape .",
    "in fact , for the condensed filaments the fit rather results in fwhms which are even further off from the actual ones .",
    "next , we consider the results obtained from the dust emission maps . assuming a distance of 150 pc typical for nearby low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. the taurus molecular cloud ) , the resolution of 0.0016 pc of the emission maps corresponds to about 2  .",
    "this , however , is significantly higher than the resolution of e.g. the _ herschel _ or iram telescopes working in the infrared and millimetre regime .",
    "hence , in order to make predictions for actual observations with these instruments , we convolve the emission maps with a gaussian beam with a size of 36  corresponding to the beam size of _ herschel _ at 500 @xmath13 m ( see * ? ? ? * for the effect of noise ) .",
    "we use all simulated wavelengths from 70 @xmath13 m to 2.6 mm and first consider the convolved column density profiles for two filaments in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ( red lines ) .",
    "no dips towards the centre can be seen , which is due to the fact that the dust remains optically thin .",
    "however , for the perpendicular magnetic field case ( bottom right panel ) , the obtained profile is dictated by the gaussian beam ( grey line ) and thus significantly off from the actual one ( black line ) .",
    "the inferred fwhms for all snapshots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_width ] with black circles . except for the three very condensed filaments ,",
    "the actual fwhms are reasonably well reproduced with differences of at most 30% .",
    "for the three condensed filaments , however , the obtained fwhms are dictated by the imposed resolution limit of 0.026 pc and overestimate the actual fwhms by a factor of a few ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , similar to the results obtained from the line emission maps .",
    "hence , it seems that neither line nor continuum emission observations ( with current single dish telescopes ) can accurately probe the width of these condensed filaments but rather give apparent widths of a few times 0.01 pc to 0.1 pc .",
    "we emphasise that this lower limit is in good agreement with recent observations @xcite .    however , when using spatial filtering as suggested by @xcite or the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array , also higher spatial resolutions of 1  or below are now accessible in the infrared and millimetre regime . for this reason , in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , for the selected snapshots we also show the column density profiles obtained from the dust emission maps without convolution .",
    "in particular for the condensed filament ( perpendicular magnetic field , bottom right panel ) , the match of the observed profile is now significantly improved .",
    "this is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_width ] , where the obtained fwhms for all runs , under the assumption of no observational resolution limitations , are shown with black triangles : for the filaments with a fwhm around 0.1 pc , there are only marginal differences of @xmath4 10% compared to the convolved case . for the condensed filaments , however , the match between the actual and observed fwhms seems to be somewhat improved , although there are indications that the observed value is now slightly too low .",
    "we note , however , that here we did not consider any interferometric effects as we have done in @xcite , which is why the accuracy of these predictions for actual observations is limited .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : temp ] ( but see also * ? ? ? * ) , there are significant variations of @xmath27 along the radial direction , which is a consequence of the heating by crs as well as the accretion shock occurring at a radius of 0.01  0.1 pc .",
    "hence , the assumption of a fixed @xmath43 along the los , which is often made in actual observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is most likely an oversimplification , which can contribute to some of the deviations between the derived and actual masses and fwhms discussed before ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] and  [ fig : crir_width ] ) .",
    "we investigate this more quantitatively in fig .",

    "we normalise the values to the value of @xmath68 at @xmath43 = 20 k. towards lower @xmath43 , @xmath68 increases faster for the @xmath5 = 2  1 transition ( dashed lines ) than for the @xmath5 = 1  0 transition . ]    for the @xmath5 = 2  1 transition ( dashed lines ) , @xmath68 shows a significantly stronger dependence on @xmath43 than for the @xmath5 = 1  0 transition ( solid lines ) : reducing @xmath43 from a fiducial value of 20 k to 12 k would increase @xmath68 by a factor of @xmath3 1.5 - 3.5 for @xmath5 = 2  1 , whereas for @xmath5 = 1  0 the increase is only marginal ( a few 10% ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the occurrence of the transition frequency @xmath37 and the upper state energy @xmath39 in the _ exponent _ in eqs .",

    "given the fact that @xmath27 varies significantly along the los ( down to about 10 k ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : temp ] ) , some of the considered velocity channels in our synthetic observations most likely have a lower @xmath43 than the actually assumed one .",
    "hence , the masses obtained from the @xmath5 = 2  1 transition can be easily lower than the actual _ and _ the @xmath5 = 1  0 mass by a factor of @xmath3 2 or more , which  at least in parts  explains the peculiar behaviour found in fig .",

    "furthermore , for the runs with a crir of the differences between the masses obtained from the @xmath5 = 1  0 and @xmath5 = 2  1 lines are significantly smaller ( bottom row ) .",
    "this fits nicely with the fact that for the excitation temperatures applied here ( @xmath69 20 k ) , @xmath68 is much less sensitive to @xmath43 than at low @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tex ] ) for both transitions .",
    "this also explains the small differences in the masses for different @xmath43 for a _ single _ transition since only excitation temperatures above 15 k were assumed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] ) .",
    "the assumption of a constant @xmath43 possibly also contributes to the overestimation of the fwhms inferred from the co emission maps for the condensed filaments ( compare fig .",

    "[ fig : profiles ] ) , they appear significantly wider than the actual column density . since , however , @xmath27 drops towards the centre of the filament ( compare fig .

    "moreover , we find that the observed @xmath26 profiles reproduce the actual profiles reasonably well , however , shifted upwards by at most .    as reported by @xcite , this shift is due to the fact that along the los gas with higher dust temperatures , in particular in the outer parts , is included ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . indeed , when fitting the modified blackbody spectrum only for wavelengths @xmath72 500 @xmath13 m as suggested by @xcite , we find that the obtained values of @xmath26 are lower by about 0.5  1 k and thus in better agreement with the actual values .",

    "we find that in particular in the lower density regime , i.e. the outer parts of the filament the @xmath5 = 1 and 2 levels are less populated than expected under the lte assumption .",
    "this is due to the fact that the h@xmath2 number density @xmath73 in this region drops below the critical density of about @xmath74 @xmath12 for the @xmath5 = 1  0 and about @xmath75 @xmath12 for the @xmath5 = 2  1 transition .",
    "due to the higher critical density for the latter , the subthermal excitation is more pronounced for the @xmath5 = 2 level , which also explains the large deviation of the @xmath5 = 2  1 masses from the true masses .",
    "hence , the following picture arises : in the centre of the filament co is in lte and emits accordingly . in the outer part ( foreground ) , however , co is only subthermally excited and will thus emit less than expected for lte .",
    "moreover , in this region any radiation ( from the centre of the filament ) might in parts be self - absorbed depending on the optical depth .",

    "we emphasise that this result qualitatively also holds for higher crirs .",
    "however , in particular the level population for @xmath5 = 1 increases with increasing crir .",
    "in addition , in the outer parts ( foreground ) the temperatures are higher ( see fig .  [",

    "furthermore , for the lvg method we artificially increased the h@xmath2 number density by a factor of 100 .",
    "as expected , in this case the spectra match the lte spectra reasonably well and the inferred masses agree better with the actual mass , which makes us confident that the obtained results are correct .",
    "in summary , we suggest that large differences in the masses obtained from @xmath5 = 2  1 and @xmath5 = 1  0 observations could possibly be used as a diagnostic tool in observations : the differences could indicate the non - isothermal state of star - forming filaments and thus possibly the occurrence of an accretion shock in the infalling gas  as it is the case in our simulations ( section  [ sec : temp ] )  but also the subthermally excited state of co. in order to disentangle both effects , we suggest to observe typical shock tracer molecules , which would indicate the presence of an accretion shock , which , due to the chemical network used in this work , can not be probed here .",
    "so far we have automatically corrected for the optical depth by means of applying eq .",

    "fig : crir_width ] , and section  [ sec : width_line ] ) .",
    "however , in particular for wider filaments with a fwhm around 0.1 pc ( see table  [ tab : models ] ) , the opacity _ uncorrected _ fwhms still match the actual ones within a factor of about 2 .    checking the values of @xmath46 determined from eq .",

    "we have used all wavelengths from 70 @xmath13 m up to 2.6 mm to infer the column density and dust temperature from the continuum emission maps .",
    "we emphasise , however , that including e.g. only the _ herschel _ bands , i.e. 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath13 m , or excluding the 70 @xmath13 m data , has only a marginal effect on the obtained mass , filament width , and central dust temperature .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the intensities at 70 @xmath13 m , 850 @xmath13 m , 1.3 mm , and 2.6 mm are lower than at other wavelengths and thus have a negligible effect when fitting the modified blackbody spectrum to derive the column density and dust temperature of each pixel ( eq .  [ eq : bb ] ) .    however , excluding all wavelengths @xmath72 500 @xmath13 m would in particular increase the inferred width by up to 30% , the inferred mass is less affected .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the densest parts are less reliably probed if the longer wavelengths are excluded @xcite .",
    "this results in lower central densities and thus  since the outer , low density parts of the filament basically remain unchanged  larger _ apparent _ filament widths . hence , overall our results suggest that the masses obtained via continuum emission show a high accuracy ( within a few percent , see fig .  [",
    "fig : crir_mass ] ) for the various wavelength regimes considered .",
    "we therefore suggest to use continuum observations to infer the mass of star - forming filaments .",
    "we note , however , that a network of overlapping filaments as seen in observations might complicate the determination of the filament mass and stability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to that , the masses obtained via line emission observations show partly significant deviations of up to a factor of 10 from the actual mass . furthermore , even when observing lines of two isotopes at the same time , a reliable calculation of @xmath43 ( and thus @xmath27 ) is often hardly possible due to different spectral shapes ( see section  [ sec : opacmulti ] ) .",
    "for this reason , in observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) often @xmath26 or a freely assumed temperature ( motivated by a typical value for @xmath26 ) is used in order to assess the stability of the filaments via comparing their mass - per - unit - length to the critical value ( eq .",
    "[ eq : crit ] , but see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] , @xmath27 does not necessarily resemble @xmath26 , which can be lower by up to a factor of a few .",
    "hence , when using the inferred _ dust _ instead of the _ gas _ temperature in eq .",
    "[ eq : crit ] , this might lead to wrong conclusions about the stability of star - forming filaments .",
    "in particular , filaments might appear significantly more gravitationally unstable than they actually are .",
    "so far , we have assumed that we have observed line emission of a _ single _ co isotope only . in case that",
    "observations of _ two _ isotopes are available , the combination of both can be used to correct for the optical depth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is usually done on a channel - by - channel basis .",
    "however , comparing the corresponding spectra of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o for one of our simulated filaments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , we find that they do not have the same functional ( gaussian ) shape .",
    "this happens when the variation of @xmath46 with the channel velocity is different for different isotopes .",
    "hence , in this case we do not recommend to correct for the optical depth on a channel - by - channel basis but rather by using the integrated intensity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasise , however , that this prevents us from determining @xmath43 , which thus remains a free parameter .",
    "we can only determine a `` channel - averaged '' @xmath46 , whereas eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ]  from which @xmath43 could be inferred  is on an individual channel basis . ]",
    "using the integrated intensity , the optical depth @xmath78 of isotope 1 is then obtained by solving @xmath79 for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the isotope abundance ratio . the optical depth @xmath82 of the isotope 2 is then given by @xmath83 .",

    "= 0 and @xmath43 = 23 k for @xmath20 = 300 kyr used already for the single isotope case .",
    "the masses are now matched significantly better than for the single transition observations , which previously showed differences up to a factor of @xmath3 4 , although still deviations of up to @xmath3 40% occur .",
    "however , both @xmath5 = 2  1 transitions still systematically underestimate the masses . as discussed in sections  [ sec : temp ] and  [",
    "sec : subtherm ] , we attribute this to the variation of the temperature along the los as well as the sub - thermal excitation of co in the outer parts .",
    "furthermore , using two isotopes to correct for @xmath46 seems also to slightly improve the ability to probe rather condensed filaments . for @xmath20 = 300 kyr",
    "the match is now somewhat better , although the actual fwhm is still overestimated by up to a factor of @xmath3 5 . for",
    "@xmath20 = 0 the fwhm is very well matched with deviations of about 10%  as for the single transition observations .",
    "we summarise the reliability of the obtained fwhms in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : width_summary ] for all snapshots with @xmath84 .",
    "overall , we find that the variations between different lines for a single snapshot ( actual fwhm ) are now significantly reduced as indicated by the smaller errorbars compared to the single line observations .",
    "furthermore , for the condensed filaments the ability to accurately measure the fwhm is somewhat improved .    inspecting the values of @xmath46 (",
    "not shown ) , for @xmath5 = 1  0 we obtain typical values of 1  5 for @xmath0co and 0.1  0.5 for c@xmath1o . for @xmath5 = 2",
    " 1 , the values of @xmath46 are on average only slightly higher reaching up to at most 10 and 1 for @xmath0co and c@xmath1o , respectively . hence ,",
    "for both transitions the values are in very good agreement with those values obtained from our single transition observations as well as actual observations by @xcite .    to summarise , for observations it seems desirable to obtain  if possible ",
    "observations of two isotopes in order to improve the accuracy of observational parameters like filament mass and width .",
    "if the spectra have different shapes , we do not recommend to make the opacity correction on a channel - by - channel basis .      in the simulations",
    "the effect of freeze - out is taken into account in a simplified manner by reducing the overall abundance of c and o. this approach , however , does not take into account any density or cr dependence . in order to test the effect of co freeze - out in more detail , we incorporated a post - processing step following the approach described in detail in @xcite . before running the radiative transfer calculations , we update the co number density by multiplying it with a factor of @xmath85 which gives the fraction of co left over in the gas phase . here , @xmath86 is the cr induced desorption rate of co @xcite , and @xmath87 the adsorption rate due to collisions of co with the dust grains @xcite , where @xmath88 is the hydrogen nuclei number density .",
    "we note that since for @xmath89 20 k as present in the simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dusttemp ] ) , the desorption process is dominated by crs , we here omitted the process of thermal desorption of co.    the effect of co freeze - out concerning the inferred mass and fwhm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freeze ] using the default ( lower ) excitation temperatures given in fig .",
    "[ fig : crir_mass ] . in general ,",
    "freeze - out results in somewhat lower masses and larger fwhms compared to the results without the aforementioned post - processing step .",
    "this is due to the reduction of co in particular in the center of the filaments , where the density is high . as expected from eqs .",
    "[ eq : freezeout ] and  [ eq : crdesorption ] , the effect decreases with increasing crir , and is almost negligible for a crir of .",
    "however , even for lower crirs the effect of co freeze - out is moderate for both mass and fwhm ( a few 10% at most ) .",
    "the only exception occurs at @xmath20 = 300 kyr for the run with a perpendicular magnetic field and a crir of ( top right panel ) . here",
    ", freeze - out leads to an increase of the inferred fwhm by up to a factor of 3 .",
    "hence , overall co freeze - out intensifies the afore described problem of overestimating the width of condensed filaments , thus supporting the findings of this paper .",
    "furthermore , we note that the imperfect thermal coupling of gas and dust even in the center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) could be in parts a consequence of the choice of our gas - dust energy transfer rate due to collision between gas and dust , which is based on @xcite . in order to test this",
    ", we repeated the run with a parallel magnetic field and a crir of @xmath16 s@xmath8 with a 6 times higher energy transfer rate as used by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the thermal coupling is improved but still not perfect .",
    "the gas temperature in the inner 0.1 pc of the filament drops by up to 8 k compared to the run with a lower energy transfer rate , whereas the dust temperature remains almost unchanged .",
    "hence , in the center @xmath27 is still about 3  10 k above @xmath26 . in the outer parts no measurable changes for both @xmath27 and @xmath26 occur .",
    "overall , we thus find that the qualitative behaviour of the temperature evolution does not change with a higher gas - dust energy transfer rate , and that gas and dust are still not ( yet ) tightly thermally coupled .",
    "finally , we note that although the dust remains optically thin , its own thermal radiation can contribute to its heating . since we do not account for this effect , in the center of the filament , where the isrf is strongly attenuated , we thus might slightly underestimate @xmath26 .",
    "we present synthetic emission maps of @xmath0co , c@xmath1o , and dust of simulations of star - forming filaments including one of the largest chemical networks ( 37 species and 287 reactions ) used to date in 3d - mhd simulations @xcite . from the synthetic observations , we calculate filament masses and widths , which we compare to the actual values as extracted from the simulation data .",
    "this allows us to test their reliability and to investigate the impact of the cosmic ray ionisation rate ( crir ) and the magnetic field structure .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * for filaments with widths around 0.1 pc or above , both line and dust emission observations can be used to determine the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) with a high accuracy ( deviations @xmath4 20% ) . for filaments with an actual fwhm @xmath67 0.1 pc ,",
    "the fwhms derived from synthetic line and dust emission maps and the actual ones diverge as the synthetic observations consistently overestimate the width by up to a factor of a few . *",
    "masses obtained from the dust emission maps reproduce the actual masses very accurately to within a few percent . for this reason",
    ", we suggest to use these to analyse the stability of filaments . * in contrast , masses inferred from line emission observations show strong variations by up to a factor of 10 between the individual lines , and partly clear deviations from the actual mass . for both @xmath0co and c@xmath1o ,",
    "the @xmath5 = 2  1 lines significantly underestimate the actual masses .",
    "the results reported here suggest a _ minimum detectable fwhm _ of a few times 0.01 pc for line emission maps and continuum observations with resolutions comparable to _ herschel _ , in good agreement with minimal values obtained by recent observations .",
    "the detection of such condensed filaments possibly indicates a low crir and/or a perpendicular magnetic field in the filament . on the other hand ,",
    "a high crir or a parallel field induces an additional thermal / magnetic pressure , which stabilizes the filaments against radial collapse resulting in widths @xmath72 0.1 pc .",
    "we attribute the inaccurate estimate of filament masses and widths of narrow filaments using molecular line observations to    * strong variations of the gas temperature @xmath27 along the los due to accretion shocks in the filaments , which are not accounted for by using a constant excitation temperature , and * self - absorption features in some of the spectra due to the high optical depth @xmath46 and the fact that co is only subthermally excited .",
    "furthermore , we emphasise that @xmath27 and @xmath26 do in general not match each other but can differ by a factor of a few",
    ". this would significantly affect the stability analysis of filaments when using @xmath26 .",
    "we find that the observed dust temperatures @xmath26 slightly overestimate the actual ones by a few k @xcite , whereas the polytropic relation between @xmath26 and the gas density can be probed reliably ( compare e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also show that inclination effects increase the mass and width obtained from line emission maps only slightly by a few 10% .",
    "values obtained from dust emission maps are almost not affected .",
    "a similar uncertainty is induced by the optical depth correction in the line emission observations : the observed lines have optical depths of @xmath46 = 1  5 for @xmath0co and @xmath46 = 0.1  1 for c@xmath1o in good agreement with observations .",
    "hence , when not correcting for @xmath46 , the observed masses would decrease and the fwhms increase by a few 10% .    finally , we show that the reliability of the obtained mass and width is improved when using two isotopes to correct for the optical depth , although the width of narrow filaments is still overestimated .",
