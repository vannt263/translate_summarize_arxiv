    "there are various reasons to suspect that baryon number is not a good symmetry of nature : ( i ) first is that nonperturbative effects of the standard model lead to @xmath2 , while keeping @xmath3 @xcite ; ( ii ) second has to do with an understanding of the origin of matter in the universe requires @xmath2 interactions@xcite and ( iii ) many theories beyond the standard model lead to interactions that violate baryon number @xcite .    if indeed such interactions are there , an important question is : can we observe them in experiments@xmath4 ?",
    "two interesting baryon nonconserving processes of experimental interest are : ( a ) proton decay e.g. @xmath5 etc @xcite and ( b ) @xmath6 oscillation @xcite .",
    "these two classes of processes probe two different selection rules for baryon nonconservation : @xmath3 for proton decay and @xmath7 for @xmath6 oscillation .",
    "they are signatures of two totally different directions for unification beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , observation of proton decay will point strongly towards a grand desert till about the scale of @xmath8 gev whereas @xmath6 oscillation will require new physics at an intermediate scale at or above the tev scale but much below the gut scale .",
    "further experimental search for both these processes can therefore provide key insight into the nature of unification beyond the standard model with or without supersymmetry .    while proton decay goes very naturally with the idea of eventual grand unification of forces and matter ,",
    "recent discoveries of neutrino oscillations have made @xmath6 oscillation to be quite plausible theoretically if small neutrino masses are to be understood as a consequence of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as follows : seesaw mechanism implies majorana neutrinos implying the existence of @xmath9 interactions . in the domain of baryons , it implies the existence of @xmath6 oscillation as noted many years ago @xcite .",
    "in fact an explicit model for @xmath6 oscillation was constructed in @xcite by implementing the seesaw mechanism within the framework of the pati - salam @xcite @xmath10 model , where quarks and leptons are unified .",
    "it was shown that this process is mediated by the exchange of diquark higgs bosons giving an amplitude ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ( @xmath11 ) which scales like @xmath12 . in the nonsupersymmetric version without fine tuning ,",
    "one expects @xmath13 leading to @xmath14 .",
    "so only if @xmath15 tev , the @xmath16 is in the range of @xmath17 sec and is accessible to experiments . on the other hand , in generic seesaw models for neutrinos ,",
    "one expects @xmath18 gev depending on the range of the third generation dirac mass for the neutrino of 1 - 100 gev .",
    "an important question therefore is whether in realistic seesaw models , @xmath6 oscillation is at all observable .",
    "another objection to the above nonsupersymmetric model for @xmath19 that was raised in the 80 s was that such interactions will erase any baryon asymmetry created at high scales .",
    "it is therefore important to overcome this objection .",
    "several years ago , a high scale seesaw model with observable @xmath0 oscillation was presented using r - parity violating interactions@xcite .",
    "such models in general lead to difficulties in understanding the origin of matter and also do not have a naturally stable supersymmetric dark matter .    in this talk ,",
    "i first discuss a recent paper@xcite where it is shown that in a class of supersymmetric @xmath20 models ( called susy @xmath21 ) , an interesting combination of circumstances improves the @xmath22 dependence of the @xmath23 to @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 making @xmath6 oscillation observable .",
    "this does not require the existence of r - parity violation and in fact in these models r - parity is naturally conserved giving rise to a stable dark matter .",
    "i then discuss a new mechanism for post - sphaleron baryogenesis where an upper limit on @xmath0 oscillation time is required to generate the desired baryon to photon ratio of the universe .",
    "the basic ingredients of such a theory was presented in @xcite where it was shown that in the minimal supersymmetric @xmath20 model , there exist accidental symmetries that imply that some of the @xmath26 s which mediate @xmath0 oscillation are in the tev range even though @xmath27 gev .",
    "the present work@xcite points out that there exist a new class of feynman diagrams which enhance the @xmath6 oscillation amplitude in generic supersymmetric models of this type making it observable .",
    "i then discuss the new mechanism for baryogenesis in models where the baryon number violation is mediated by a higher dimensional operator such as in the case of @xmath0 oscillation@xcite .    at present , the best lower",
    "bound on @xmath28 comes from ill reactor experiment @xcite and is @xmath29 sec .",
    "there are also comparable bounds from nucleon decay search experiments @xcite .",
    "there are proposals to improve the precision of this search by at least two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we feel that the results of this paper@xcite should give new impetus to a search for neutron - antineutron oscillation .",
    "the quarks and leptons in this model are unified and transform as @xmath30 representations of @xmath10 . for the higgs sector",
    ", we choose , @xmath31 and @xmath32 to give mass to the fermions .",
    "the @xmath33 to break the @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "the diquarks mentioned above which lead to @xmath35 processes are contained in the @xmath36 multiplet .",
    "we also add a @xmath34 neutral triplet @xmath37 which helps to reduce the number of light diquark states .",
    "the superpotential of this model is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 note that since we do not have parity symmetry in the model , the yukawa couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not symmetric matrices .",
    "when @xmath45 , this superpotential has an accidental global symmetry much larger than the gauge group@xcite ; as a result , vacuum breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry leads to the existence of light diquark states that mediate @xmath46 oscillation and enhance the amplitude .",
    "in fact it was shown that for @xmath47 and @xmath48 and all vevs in the range of @xmath49 gev , the light states are those with quantum numbers : @xmath50 .",
    "the symmetry argument behind is that @xcite for @xmath45 , the above superpotential is invariant under @xmath51 symmetry which breaks down to @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "this results in 21 complex massless states ; on the other hand these vevs also breaks the gauge symmetry down from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "this allows nine of the above states to pick up masses of order @xmath56 leaving 12 massless complex states which are the six @xmath57 plus six @xmath58 states .",
    "once @xmath59 and is of order @xmath60 , they pick up mass ( call @xmath61 ) of order of the elctroweak scale .",
    "to discuss @xmath6 oscillation , we introduce a new term in the superpotential of the form@xcite : @xmath62 where the @xmath63 etc stand for @xmath64 indices and we have suppressed the @xmath65 indices .",
    "apriori @xmath66 could be of order @xmath67 ; however the terms in eq.(2 ) are different from those in eq . ( 4 ) ; so they could arise from different a high scale theory .",
    "the mass @xmath66 is therefore a free parameter that we choose to be much less than the @xmath67 .",
    "this term does not affect the masses of the higgs fields .",
    "when @xmath68 acquires a vev , @xmath69 interaction are induced from this superpotential , and @xmath6 oscillation are generated by two diagrams given in fig . 1 and 2 . the first diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) in which only diquark higgs fields are involved was already discussed in @xcite and goes like @xmath70 , taking @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as in the argument @xcite , we see that this diagram scales like @xmath74 . in ref.@xcite a new diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) was pointed out which owes its origin to supersymmetry .",
    "we get for its contribution to @xmath75 : @xmath76 using the same arguments as above , we find that this diagram scales like @xmath77 which is therefore a significant enhancement over diagram in fig.1 .",
    "oscillation as discussed in ref . 8 . ]",
    "oscillation . ]    in order to estimate the rate for @xmath6 oscillation , we need not only the different mass values for which we now have an order of magnitude , we also need the yukawa coupling @xmath78 .",
    "now @xmath78 is a small number since its value is associated with the lightest right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "however , in the calculation we need its value in the basis where quark masses are diagonal .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 diagrams involve only the right - handed quarks , the rotation matrix need not be the ckm matrix .",
    "the right - handed rotations need to be large e.g. in order to involve @xmath79 ( which is @xmath80 ) , we need @xmath81 to be large , where @xmath82 .",
    "the left - handed rotation matrices @xmath83 contribute to the ckm matrix , but right - handed rotation matrices @xmath84 are unphysical in the standard model . in this model , however , we get to see its contribution since we have a left - right gauge symmetry .",
    "let us now estimate the time of oscillation .",
    "when we start with a @xmath85-diagonal basis ( call the diagonal matrix @xmath86 ) , the majorana coupling @xmath78 in the diagonal basis of up- and down - type quark matrices can be written as @xmath87 .",
    "now @xmath88 is @xmath80 and @xmath89 can be @xmath90 , so @xmath78 is about 0.4 in the diagonal basis of the quark matrices .",
    "we use @xmath91 , @xmath61 @xmath92 gev and @xmath93 gev .",
    "the mass of @xmath94 i.e. @xmath95 is @xmath96 gev which is obtained from the vev of @xmath37 .",
    "we choose @xmath97 gev .",
    "putting all the above the numbers together , we get @xmath98 along with the hadronic matrix element @xcite , the @xmath0 oscillation time is found to be about @xmath99 sec which is within the reach of possible next generation measurements .",
    "if we chose , @xmath100 , we will get for @xmath101 sec . unless we choose the @xmath102 to be lower ( say @xmath103 gev ) .",
    "this is a considerable enhancement over the nonsupersymmetric model of @xcite with seesaw scale of @xmath104 gev .",
    "we also note that as noted in @xcite the model is invariant under the hidden discrete symmetry under which a field @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the baryon number of the field @xmath107 . as a result , proton is absolutely stable in the model .",
    "furthermore , since r - parity is an automatic symmetry of mssm , this model has a naturally stable dark matter .",
    "in the early 1980 s when the idea of neutron - anti - neutron oscillation was first proposed in the context of unified gauge theories , it was thought that the high dimensionality of the @xmath2 operator would pose major difficulty in understanding the origin of matter .",
    "the main reason for this is that the higher dimensional operators remain in thermal equilibrium until late in the evolution of the universe since the thermal decoupling temperature @xmath108 for such interactions goes roughly like @xmath109 which is in the range of temperatures where b+l violating sphaleron transitions are full thermal equilibrium .",
    "they will therefore erase any baryon asymmetry generated in the very early moments of the universe ( say close to the gut time of @xmath110 sec . or so ) in prevalent baryogenesis models . in models with observable @xmath0 oscillation therefore , one has to search for new mechanisms for generating baryons below the weak scale . in this section ,",
    "we discuss such a possibility@xcite discussed in a recent unpublished work with k. s. babu and s. nasri .    as an illustration of the way the new mechanism operates ,",
    "let us assume that there is a scalar field that couples to the @xmath111 operator i.e. @xmath112 , where the scalar boson has mass of order of the weak scale and @xmath113 .",
    "this leads to baryon number violation if @xmath114 and observable @xmath0 transition if @xmath115 is in the few hundred to 1000 gev range .",
    "the direct decay of @xmath116 in these models can lead to an adequate mechanism for baryogenesis .    to discuss how this comes about ,",
    "let us first note that the high dimension of @xmath117 allows the scalar @xmath2 decay to go out of equilibrium at weak scale temperatures .",
    "this clearly satisfies the out of equilibrium condition given by sakharov conditions for origin of matter@xcite .",
    "this is the reason we require a higher dimensional operator . for direct proton decay operators such as @xmath118 ,",
    "the decoupling temperature is much higher and our mechanism will not apply .    to outline the rest of the details of this mechanism@xcite",
    ", we consider an effective sub - tev scale model that gives rise to the higher dimensional operator for @xmath119 oscillation .",
    "it consists of the following color sextet , @xmath120 singlet scalar bosons @xmath121 with hypercharge @xmath122 respectively that couple to quarks .",
    "these states could emerge from the supersymmetric model described in the previous section if @xmath123 .",
    "we add to it a scalar field with mass in the 100 gev range .",
    "one can now write down the following standard model invariant interaction lagrangian : @xmath124 the scalar field @xmath116 is assumed to have @xmath113 . to see the constraints on the parameters of the theory ,",
    "we note that the present limits on @xmath125 sec .",
    "implies that the strength @xmath126 of the the @xmath127 transition is @xmath128 gev@xmath129 . from fig .",
    "3 , we conclude that @xmath130 for @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 tev . in our discussion , we will stay close to this range of parameters and see how one can understand the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the singlet field will play a key role in the generation of baryon asymmetry .",
    "we assume that @xmath133 but @xmath134 gev , where @xmath135 is the real part of the @xmath116 field after its vev is subtracted .",
    "it can then decay into final states with @xmath136 .    on the way to calculating the baryon asymmetry ,",
    "let us first discuss the out of equilibrium condition . as the temperature of the universe falls below the masses of the @xmath137 particles , the annihilation processes @xmath138 ( and analogous processes for @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) remain in equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "the number density of @xmath137 particles gets depleted and only the @xmath116 particle survives along with the usual standard model particles .",
    "one of the primary generic decay modes of @xmath116 is @xmath141 .",
    "there could be other decay modes which depend on the details of the model .",
    "those can be made negligible by choice of parameters which do not enter our discussion of @xmath0 and baryogenesis . for @xmath142 , the decay rate of @xmath116",
    "is given by @xmath143 where we have set the masses of @xmath144 and @xmath140 particle to be of same order for simplicity .",
    "this decay goes out of equilibrium around @xmath145 .",
    "here we have assumed that the coupling of the @xmath137 particles to second and third generation quarks are of order 0.1 - 1 .",
    "this gives @xmath146 or in the sub - tev range .",
    "below this temperature the decay rate of @xmath116 falls very rapidly as the temperature cools .",
    "however as soon as @xmath147 , the decay rate becomes a constant whereas the expansion rate of the universe is slowing down .",
    "so at a temperature @xmath148 , @xmath116 will start to decay at @xmath149 since the corresponding epoch must be above that of big bang nucleosynthesis , this puts a constraint on the parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath150 gev and @xmath151 tev , we get @xmath152 gev .",
    "also this implies that the @xmath137 masses can not be arbitrarily high , since the heavier these particles are , the lower @xmath148 will be .",
    "we expect this upper limit to be in the tev range at most .",
    "it is well known that baryon asymmetry can arise only via the interference of a tree diagram with a one loop diagram .",
    "the tree diagram is clearly the one where @xmath153 .",
    "there are however two classes of loop diagrams that can contribute : one where the loop involves the same fields @xmath144 and @xmath140 .",
    "a second one involves w - exchange , which involves only standard model physics at this scale ( fig .",
    "we find that the second contribution can actually dominate .",
    "it also has the advantage that it involves less number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "the baryon asymmetry is defined as follows @xmath154        we find that @xmath155;\\ ; m_s > m_t &          \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{asym}\\ ] ] note that the trace in the above equation has an imaginary part and therefore leads to nonzero asymmetry .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetry depends on @xmath156 as well as the detailed profile of the various coupling matrices @xmath157 and we can easily get the desired value of the baryon asymmetry by appropriately choosing them .",
    "we have checked that there is no conflict between the desired magnitude of baryon asymmetry and the present lower bound on the @xmath0 transition time of @xmath29 sec .",
    "an important point about our baryogenesis mechanism , is that as the masses of the @xmath137 particles get larger , the amount of baryon asymmetry goes down for given @xmath158 ( due to the dilution factor @xmath156 discussed below ) as does the strength of the @xmath111 transition giving interesting correlation between the @xmath0 process and baryon asymmetry .",
    "in fact an adequate baryogenesis puts an upper limit on @xmath159 as discussed below .    using @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 we find @xmath166 .",
    "there is a further dilution of the baryon asymmetry arising from the fact that @xmath167 since the decay of @xmath116 also releases entropy into the universe . in this case",
    "the baryon asymmetry reads @xmath168 in order that this dilution effect is not excessive , there must be a lower limit on the ratio @xmath156 .    from our estimate",
    "above we require that @xmath169 . since the decay rate of the @xmath116 boson depends inversely as a high power of @xmath170",
    ", higher @xmath144 bosons would imply that @xmath171 is satisfied at a lower temperature and hence give a lower @xmath156 . in figure",
    "@xmath172 we plotted @xmath170 vs @xmath173 using @xmath174 , and the constraint @xmath175 .",
    "the coupling @xmath176 .",
    "this in turn implies that the @xmath159 must have an upper limit .",
    "for instance , for choice of the coupling parameters @xmath177 , and @xmath178 we find @xmath179 .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a realistic quark - lepton unified model where despite the high seesaw ( @xmath22 ) scale ( in the range of @xmath180 gev ) , the @xmath0 oscillation time can be around @xmath181 sec .",
    "due to the presence of a new supersymmetric graph and accidental symmetries of the higgs potential ( also connected to supersymmetry ) .",
    "this oscillation time is within the reach of possible future experiments .",
    "we have also found a new way to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe for the case when @xmath0 oscillation is observable .",
    "these results should provide a motivation to conduct a new round of search for @xmath0 oscillation .",
