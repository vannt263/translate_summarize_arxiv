    "spintronics is a novel branch of nanoscience which exploits spin properties of electrons or nuclei instead of charge degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most current efforts in designing and manufacturing the spintronics devices are focused now on finding novel ways of both generation and utilization of spin - polarized currents .",
    "this , in particular , includes the study of spin - dependent transport in semiconductor nanostructures , which can operate as spin polarizers or spin filters .",
    "although spintronics can have a lot of practical applications @xcite - @xcite , one of them is most interesting and ambitious : the application of electron or nuclear spins to quantum information processing and quantum computation @xcite - @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a new type of spin polarizer constructed from the finite array of semiconducting quantum dots ( qd ) attached to a quantum wire ( qw ) .",
    "all dots of the array are identical and each of them carries the spin 1/2 .",
    "the schematic construction of the proposed device is shown for a single dot in fig.1 and for the finite array of dots in fig.2 .    using the mathematical modeling based on zero - range potentials",
    "@xcite , @xcite we reduce the problem of spin - dependent transport in the device to exactly solvable scattering problem . in terms of the scattering data , in particular , in terms of spin - dependent transmission coefficients through the device , we calculate the most important measurable characteristics : the polarization efficiency @xmath6 and the conductance @xmath7 of the device .",
    "in this section we formulate the physical conditions under which our mathematical modeling is relevant .",
    "we assume that in the quantum wire connected with a quantum dots one - mode propagation of electrons in a ballistic regime can be realized .",
    "for the ballistic propagation of electrons through the qw the de broglie wavelength @xcite @xmath8 has to be much greater than both the mean free path @xmath9 in the material of qw and the length @xmath10 of qw between the neighboring quantum dots , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    on the other hand in order to use zero - range potentials for mathematical modeling of scattering by quantum dots the de broglie wavelength has to be greater than the mean size @xmath13 of the dot : @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to manufacture quantum dots ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "depending on technology the mean size of quantum dots varies from 20 nm for small dots up to more than 100 nm for the large dots . in order to satisfy all the constrains mentioned above we have to assume that spin - gun can be realized on relatively small qd using narrow - gap semiconductors ( i.e. semiconductors with small @xmath15",

    "due to the breit - fermi theory @xcite the spin - spin interaction in frames of this simplest model leads to a singular interaction @xmath33 in the model hamiltonian : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance between the electron and the quantum dot , @xmath36 is the 1d delta function , @xmath37 is the coupling constant , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the electron and the quantum dot spin operators respectively : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the pauli matrices and @xmath44    thus , the schrdinger equation relevant to the proposed model has the form @xmath45\\,\\ , \\psi(x , s_{3}(1),s_{3}(2))= k^{2}\\psi(x , s_{3}(1),s_{3}(2)),\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the unit operator in the total spin space @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the effective mass of electron in semiconductor material of the quantum wire and @xmath49 means the tensor product , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 . the wave function",

    "the second index in @xmath76 means the values of the total spin projection @xmath77 the basis vector in the singlet subspace reads @xmath78 .",
    "the above described spinors form the orthonormal basis in the total spin space @xmath64 .",
    "hence the total wave function @xmath79 can be decomposed as follows @xmath80    in order to separate the spin variables in the problem ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ bval ] ) it is sufficient to calculate the action of the operator @xmath81 on these spinors .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath82 , where @xmath77 and @xmath83 .",
    "since the chosen basis of spinors is an orthonormal system the separation of spin variables in the channel @xmath67 and @xmath84 gives the following boundary value problem for the coordinate parts of the wave function ( [ wavefunc ] ) @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 here @xmath88 is a two - component vector @xmath89 where @xmath77 , @xmath90 is the coupling constant in the singlet channel and @xmath91 is the coupling constant in the triplet channel . in the proposed model in the absence of relativistic effects",
    "the total spin @xmath92 conserves and the triplet - singlet and singlet - triplet transitions are forbidden . as a consequence ,",
    "the antidiagonal elements of the coupling matrix in boundary condition ( [ bvalunite ] ) are equal to zero",
    ". since the projection of the total spin @xmath93 also conserves , one can choose in the boundary problem above any value of this projection . in what follows we set @xmath94 .",
    "the single - dot hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) for the case of periodic array of @xmath95 quantum dots is modified as follows @xmath96 where points @xmath97 are separated by distance @xmath10 .",
    "all the constructions of the previous section are easily generalized for this case .",
    "hence after separation of spin variables in the equation @xmath98 one obtains for the coordinate part @xmath99 of the total wave function @xmath100 the following boundary value problem @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103    the transmission coefficient in the triplet channel @xmath104 and singlet channel @xmath105 are calculated in terms of elements of the @xmath106 matrix @xmath107 , @xmath108 , ( @xmath109 is the line number , @xmath110 is the column number ) which is the product of transition matrices through dots and wires connected dots .",

    "@xmath10 is the distance between the centers @xmath97 where @xmath116functions are localized .",
    "as applied to the physical situation we are modeling @xmath10 is the length of a quantum wire connecting two neighbor dots .",
    "the transmission coefficients have the form @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "the reflection coefficients @xmath119 , @xmath120 in the triplet and singlet channels respectively are given by equations @xmath121 , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 .",
    "the relations @xmath124   ( @xmath125 ) which imply the unitarity of scattering has been checked by means of analytical calculations package .    in the case @xmath126",
    "one has @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( @xmath125 )",
    "in this section we present the results of the numerical calculations of the operation regime characteristics for the spin gun and discuss the proper choice of the model parameters as well as the choice of semiconductor materials for qw and qd .",
    "we use the applied bias @xmath129 for tuning the spin polarization effects in the device .    in order to calculate the conductance @xmath130 of the device we exploit the two - channel landauer formula at zero - temperature limit : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "following @xcite we shall use the polarization efficiency @xmath133 the conductance @xmath130 and polarization efficiency @xmath134 of the device both depend on the model parameters : the distance @xmath10 , the coupling constants @xmath135 , @xmath136 and the number @xmath95 of qd .",
    "they also both depend on the choice of semiconductor materials from which the qd and qw are fabricated , i.e. effective mass @xmath48 , fermi energy @xmath137 and mean size @xmath13 of quantum dots .",
    "varying the bias applied one can calculate the dependence of @xmath130 and @xmath134 on @xmath138 at fixed model parameters and chosen @xmath48 , @xmath137 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us mention that from spin analysis in section 3 one has @xmath139 .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath95 are free parameters of the model the only parameter has to be fixed is @xmath135 .",
    "the reasonable way to fix this parameter is to take it proportional to the inverse mean size of the quantum dot .",
    "for relatively small qd @xmath140 .",
    "hence @xmath141 .",
    "taking @xmath142 we obtain the value of order @xmath1 for the dimensionless parameter @xmath143    in figures 3 - 5 we show the dependence of @xmath130 and @xmath134 on the dimensionless parameter @xmath144 for @xmath145 in the cases @xmath146 .",
    "we also indicate the position of fermi level @xmath147 in @xmath27 ( @xmath148 ) and fix the inter - dot distance @xmath149 .",
    "the general behavior of the conductance @xmath130 and polarization efficiency @xmath134 for the wide range of parameters variation is the following . on the @xmath150-axis with the growth of the number @xmath95 of quantum dots there arise the so - called `` working windows '' ( see figure 5 ) , i.e. such intervals @xmath151 $ ] , @xmath152$], ... in which @xmath134 and @xmath130 are sufficiently high simultaneously . due to",
    "the interference processes in a qd array at @xmath153 the values of @xmath134 and @xmath130 on the working windows approach @xmath154 and @xmath155 which equals to one half of its upper limit .",
    "it means that at @xmath150 lying in the working windows the spin gun really produces the fully polarized spin beam and conducts at fairly high level . in figures 3 - 5 the working windows lie on the right of @xmath156 up to the value of @xmath157 which corresponds to the bias applied .",
    "there are a lot of interesting modifications of the model we constructed .",
    "for example , we are going to take into account the internal structure of quantum dots .",
    "we plan to supply the quantum dot by prescribed internal structure remaining the model exactly solvable .",
    "other interesting modification is to take into account the coulomb interaction between the electron and quantum dot if the dot is charged .",
    "we shall prove that if we switch on the coulomb interaction the modified model remains exactly solvable .",
    "finally we are going to incorporate in our model the magnetic field in order manipulate spins in qw and qd .",
    "the idea to use interference effect in finite periodic structures in order to amplify the polarization of electronic beam and the name of a such type spintronic devices ( spin - gun ) were proposed by n.t .",
