    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the electroweak symmetry breaking results in a physical neutral cp - even higgs boson . there also exist various models extended by increasing higgs fields , such as the multi - higgs doublet model where there are extra two neutral and two charged physical higgs bosons for each additional doublet .",
    "if cp is a good symmetry in the higgs sector , one of the extra neutral bosons is cp - even and the other is cp - odd .",
    "if cp is not invariant , all of the higgs states which have same quantum numbers except for the cp property can be mixed in their mass eigenstates .",
    "then , physical higgs bosons do not have definite cp parity .",
    "one of the notable advantages of a photon linear collider ( plc ) is to provide information about the cp property of the higgs boson by use of linear polarizations of colliding photons . defining @xmath1 two - photon states as @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicate their helicities with @xmath5 units",
    ", the cp transformation leads to the other states : @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "then , the cp eigenstates are @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; the former is a @xmath1 component of parallel polarized photons and couples to a cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath10 ) , and the latter is of perpendicularly polarized photons and couples to a cp - odd one ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , because colliding beams at plc are generated by the compton back - scattering between high energy electrons and laser photons , the energy spectrum of @xmath12 distributes broadly and the degrees of polarizations depend strongly on @xmath13 , where @xmath12 and @xmath14 are the center - of - mass energy of @xmath15 collisions and @xmath16 collisions at parent lc . in the case of the @xmath17 gev lc",
    ", linear polarizations can be used effectively for relatively light higgs bosons whose masses are less than about a few hundred gev . for heavier higgs bosons ,",
    "it is necessary that the electron energy is raised or we use other methods , conventionally .",
    "we propose one method where we take advantage of interference between higgs - production and background amplitudes with circular polarized beams .",
    "a broad peak of the @xmath12 spectrum in the range where the degrees of circular polarizations become large is helpful to the method , because we have an interest in the energy dependence of the interference effects .",
    "as an example , we consider the process @xmath18 which receives contribution from the higgs - exchanged @xmath19-channel diagram and the top - quark - exchanged @xmath20-channel ones .",
    "the helicity - dependent cross sections are expressed as @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the helicity amplitudes of higgs resonance ( @xmath24 = @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and top continuum processes , @xmath25 denote the helicities of colliding photons in @xmath5 units , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the final @xmath28 and @xmath29 helicities in the center - of - mass frame in @xmath30 ( we also write @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . ) .",
    "there is another observable sensitive to cp parity .",
    "when the decay of a top quark is taken into account , the cross sections for the processes @xmath38 can be written by @xmath39~ re \\left [ { \\cal d}_{l}^{\\lambda } \\overline{\\cal d}_{l}^{\\overline{\\lambda } } { \\cal d}_{r}^{\\lambda * } \\overline{\\cal d}_{r}^{\\overline{\\lambda } * } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & 2~im \\left [ { \\cal m}^{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 ll }   { \\cal m}^{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 rr * } \\right]~ i m \\left [ { \\cal d}_{l}^{\\lambda } \\overline{\\cal d}_{l}^{\\overline{\\lambda } } { \\cal d}_{r}^{\\lambda * } \\overline{\\cal d}_{r}^{\\overline{\\lambda } * } \\right ] \\biggr\\}. \\label{sigma - bw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the decay amplitudes for the processes @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the explicit forms of which are in the appendix of ref .",
    "we notice the azimuthal angles of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 rest frame . describing them as @xmath24 and @xmath46 , they appear in the third and fourth terms in eq .",

    "\\simeq i m \\left [ { \\cal m}^{++ ll}_{\\phi } { \\cal m}^{++ rr*}_{cont } \\right]$ ] is satisfied considering @xmath50 .",
    "since the higgs - production amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 have opposite signs in the mssm - type models , @xmath53 tells us the cp parity of the higgs boson . a numerical calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "though the quantity turns out to be rather small because of cancellation between the contributions from longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath54 s , we can recover the sensitivity to the cp parity by taking account of @xmath54-decay distributions .",
    "when the cp symmetry is not conserved in the higgs potential , the helicity amplitudes for the higgs - production are denoted by @xmath55       \\left[\\,\\sigma\\beta_t a_t -i b_t\\right ]       \\delta_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2}\\delta_{\\sigma \\overline\\sigma}\\ , .",

    "since \\{@xmath62 } or / and \\{@xmath63 } have non - zero values simultaneously , they induce complicated interference .",
    "moreover , the amplitudes include six parameters for vertices ; @xmath62 are complex , whereas @xmath63 are real .",
    "therefore , we need at least six observables to determine the cp property completely and are urged to use linear polarizations as well .",
    "all observables obtained from various polarizations ( including the mixture of linear and circular ones ) are exhibited in ref .",
    "we have discussed measurement of the cp property of the higgs boson at plc . it has been found that we can extract information about the cp property of the higgs boson from the observation of interference effects between higgs - production and background amplitudes .",
