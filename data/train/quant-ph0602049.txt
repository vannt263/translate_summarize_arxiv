    "the transverse motion of charged particles in a constant magnetic field is fully delocalized .",
    "the classical trajectories of particles projected on the plane perpendicular to the field are circles which can be moved around without changing the particle energy .",
    "the wave functions of a particle in quantum mechanics exhibit the same behavior .",
    "if @xmath0 is a solution of the schrdinger or the dirac equation with the energy @xmath1 , then a shifted wave function @xmath2 is also a solution with the same energy . in the present paper",
    "we shall show that electromagnetic beams with vortex lines localize the classical and quantum states at the position of the vortex and when the vortex line is moved the orbits will follow . in order to describe these properties quantitatively",
    "we shall use new exact solutions of the equations of motion obtained in the presence of an electromagnetic field comprising a constant magnetic field and a wave with a vortex line .",
    "this paper extends our earlier analysis @xcite by adding a constant magnetic field .",
    "this extension is significant because the addition of a constant field introduces the third parameter characterizing the electromagnetic field .",
    "from the three parameters ( the wave frequency and two field amplitudes ) we can construct two dimensionless parameters and the space of distinct solutions , as compared to those given in @xcite , becomes much richer .",
    "an extensive analysis of the exact solutions of relativistic equations of motion can be found in a monograph by bagrov and gitman @xcite .",
    "however , they overlooked the existence of the solutions described in this paper .",
    "a related problem  the motion of a particle in a constant magnetic field and a plane electromagnetic wave  has been treated in detail by roberts and buchsbaum @xcite a long time ago .",
    "the crucial difference between these two cases is that the translational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field is broken by the presence of an electromagnetic vortex and the problem becomes truly three - dimensional .",
    "the aim of the present paper is not only to present new analytic solutions of the classical and quantum equations of motion in some realistic configurations of the electromagnetic field but also to describe a universal confining mechanism of charged particles that might have experimental applications .",
    "this mechanism acts for all electromagnetic waves with a definite angular momentum .",
    "such waves are characterized by the presence of an electromagnetic vortex . at the vortex the field vanishes and near the vortex the electric and magnetic field vectors exhibit a characteristic behavior that leads to the trapping of particles .",
    "the trapping of atoms by electromagnetic vortices is a well established phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it employs the dipole force pushing atoms in the direction of a decreasing field amplitude in a laser beam that is blue - detuned from the relevant atomic transition .",
    "the mechanism for trapping charged particles by electromagnetic vortices is completely different .",
    "it employs the rotation of the electric and magnetic field vectors near the vortex line .",
    "this paper contains a complete , classical , and quantum mechanical description of the motion of charged particles in a combination of an electromagnetic wave with an embedded vortex and a constant magnetic field .",
    "our treatment is fully relativistic but we also present the results in the nonrelativistic limit . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce a model electromagnetic wave that approximates very well , near the vortex line , all solutions of maxwell equations with the lowest angular momentum . in sec .",
    "iii we give general solutions of the lorentz equations in such a wave and exhibit a mechanism that confines the particle in the vicinity of the vortex line . in sec .",
    "iv we show how trapped particles can be transported by moving vortex lines . in sec .",
    "v we carry our analysis to the quantum theory presenting exact solutions of the dirac equation in the presence of a wave with a vortex and the magnetic field .",
    "finally , we present solutions of the schrdinger equation describing the transport of landau orbits .",
    "the notion of a vortex line of the electromagnetic field can be traced back to an old paper by rainich @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis with many examples has been recently given by us in ref .",
    "@xcite . in thia paper",
    "we shall use only a very special case of the vortex line  the one that is found in null solutions of the maxwell equations @xcite . in reality ,",
    "vortex lines of the electromagnetic field are most commonly found in beams carrying angular momentum @xcite .",
    "such beams can now be produced with the use of several methods : computer generated holograms , axicons , spatial light modulators , and biaxial crystals , etc .. the best known examples of such beams are the bessel beams and the exact laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams .",
    "these are solutions of the maxwell equations obtained by separating the variables in cylindrical coordinates @xcite .",
    "a convenient description of these beams in terms of just one complex function is obtained with the use of a complex vector @xmath3 which we named the riemann - silberstein ( rs ) vector @xcite .",
    "the rs vector obeys the complex form of maxwell equations @xmath4 we shall use a representation of @xmath5 in terms of just one complex function    [ solf ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 is an arbitrary complex solution of the wave equation @xmath8 an equivalent representation of the electromagnetic field expressed in terms of two real solutions of the wave equation , instead of a single complex solution of the wave equation , has been given by whittaker @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath9 for the bessel beams and for the laguerre - gaussian beams are most easily expressed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "the bessel beams are labeled by the following parameters ( `` quantum numbers '' ) : the transverse wave vector @xmath11 , the ( dimensionless ) angular momentum @xmath12 , the wave vector @xmath13 in the direction of propagation , and the helicity @xmath14 @xmath15 the laguerre - gaussian beams are defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the laguerre polynomial . the natural number @xmath20 gives the number of zeros of the polynomial but otherwise has no direct physical meaning .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 determines the transverse size ( waist ) of the lg beam . in the limit ,",
    "when @xmath22 for bessel beams and @xmath23 for lg beams , both functions ( [ bes ] ) and ( [ lg ] ) reduce ( for @xmath24 and apart from numerical prefactors ) to the same solution of the wave equation @xmath25 this choice of @xmath7 leads to the following rs vector @xmath26 where we again disregarded some numerical prefactors .",
    "the rs vector ( [ rs1 ] ) is a good approximation to the laguerre - gaussian and bessel beams near the @xmath27 axis , when @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "it belongs to a family of the solutions of the maxwell equations describing vortex lines riding atop a null electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the simplest solution , the one with a unit vortex strength , is obtained by choosing @xmath30 in eq .  ( [ rs1 ] ) . in this case , the electric and magnetic field vectors are    [ vortex ] @xmath31    where we introduced the field amplitude expressed in terms of the magnetic field strength and    [ fg ] @xmath32    this simple , linear dependence of the field vectors on @xmath33 and @xmath34 will enable us to find explicit solutions of the equations of motion . the expressions ( [ vortex ] ) and ( [ fg ] ) show that the sign factor @xmath35 determines the helicity  the sense of rotation of the pair of vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 . at each point",
    "this pair of vectors rotates with the wave frequency @xmath38 but , in contrast to the circularly polarized plane wave , the orientation is not the same in the whole plane but the pair rotates as we move around the vortex line ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . in our case , since the vortex has a unit strength , the full rotation angle is @xmath39 .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that there exist analytic solutions in the classical and quantum theory describing the motion of charged particles in the presence of the electromagnetic beam [ eq.[vortex ] ] .",
    "exact solutions exist because the transverse motion ( in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the beam propagation ) almost separates from the longitudinal motion .",
    "the separation is not complete but the longitudinal motion influences only the _ values _ of the integration constant appearing in the equations of motion describing the transverse dynamics .",
    "the exact solvability is not destroyed by the presence of an additional constant magnetic field aligned with the beam direction .",
    "the presence of this field adds a new dimension to the space of control parameters and significantly enriches the dynamical behavior of the system .    the electromagnetic field ( [ vortex ] )",
    "may seem unrealistic since its amplitude increases without bound with the growing distance from the @xmath27 axis .",
    "however , we shall show that the particle is often confined to a region close to the @xmath27 axis and is subject practically the same field as that of much more realistic laguerre - gaussian or bessel beams .",
    "this expectation has been recently fully confirmed in @xcite where we have shown that numerical solutions of the lorentz equation in the presence of bessel beams near the vortex line exhibit the same behavior as the analytic solutions found in @xcite for the model wave ( [ vortex ] ) .",
    "we shall give first a fully relativistic description of the motion because the nonrelativistic approximation can be easily obtained from the relativistic solution by taking the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the lorentz equations of motion @xmath41{\\dot\\xi}_{\\nu}(\\tau),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that govern the motion of a relativistic particle moving in the presence of the electromagnetic wave [ eq.([vortex ] ) ] and a constant magnetic field @xmath42 , aligned with the beam direction , can be written in the form    [ lorentz ] @xmath43,\\label{l3}\\\\ c\\,{\\ddot\\theta}&= \\sigma\\frac{\\omega_c\\,\\omega}{c } { \\dot\\xi}f(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta,\\theta ) + { \\dot\\eta}g(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta,\\theta ) ] , \\label{l4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 are the space components and @xmath45 is the time component of the four - vector @xmath46 . to save space we dropped the dependence on @xmath47 .",

    "the negative value of @xmath50 means the reversal of the magnetic field direction .    from now on",

    "( [ l3 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ l4 ] ) which gives @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",

    "( [ const1 ] ) integrated with respect to @xmath47 yields @xmath65 hence , the proper time is simply proportional to the light - front variable and this will enable us to separate the transverse motion from the longitudinal motion .",

    "thus , the dynamics of the particle is governed by the three frequencies @xmath77 the form @xmath78 of eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) suggests a transformation to the frame rotating ( in proper time ) with the angular velocity @xmath79 around the @xmath27-axis .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath70 and @xmath71 by the new variables    [ new ] @xmath80    or in complex notation @xmath81 upon substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) , we get rid of an explicit @xmath47 dependence and obtain the following equations with constant coefficients for @xmath82 and @xmath83    [ aeq ] @xmath84    the mutual relationships between the three frequencies @xmath76 , @xmath75 , and @xmath50 determine whether the transverse motion is localized near the @xmath27 axis or is unbounded .",
    "a full description is most easily done in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ aeq ] ) can be obtained from the following hamiltonian @xmath85 where @xmath86 this hamiltonian ( for @xmath87 ) differs by a canonical transformation from the one considered in ref .",
    "we found this new form of the hamiltonian more convenient than the previous one .",

    "these are the same equations of motion ( only with different values of the coefficients ) that govern the dynamics of particles in the mechanical model of the paul trap @xcite , trojan asteroids in the sun - jupiter system , and trojan wave packets of rydberg electrons in an electromagnetic wave @xcite or in a molecule with an electric dipole moment @xcite . as a matter of fact , every quadratic hamiltonian , by an appropriate linear canonical transformation , can be reduced to the form ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the characteristic frequencies in the present case are @xmath93 where we used @xmath76 as a yardstick to measure all frequencies , i.e. @xmath94 the description of the motion with the use of two dimensionless parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 is very convenient because it exhibits a self - similarity inherent in our problem . the dimensionless ratios @xmath95 and @xmath96 provide a unified description of different physical situations .",
    "for example , a particle in a 2.45ghz microwave oven will show the same behavior as a particle in an optical wave of a 505 nm blue laser provided we increase the amplitude of the wave and the strength of the magnetic field by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "an increase or decrease of all three frequencies by the same factor does not change the character of the motion but it results in a decrease or increase of characteristic space and time scales .",
    "we shall take this fact into account and express the distances in units of the angular wavelength @xmath98 and the time in units of an angular period @xmath99 .",

    "we would like to stress that despite its quadratic form the hamiltonian of the transverse motion does not correspond to a simple harmonic oscillator in two dimensions because the frequencies of oscillations @xmath102 are not fixed once and for all but they depend on the initial velocities through the parameter @xmath57 .",

    "the appearance of two additional frequencies @xmath129 is a new feature that is not found in the absence of the constant magnetic field .",
    "note that the motion in the transverse plane is not completely decoupled from the longitudinal motion because the effective frequency @xmath76 , appearing abundantly in the formula ( [ sol ] ) , depends ( through @xmath130 ) on the initial velocity in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the presence of stability and instability windows is a manifestation of the _",
    "parametric resonance_. in the region of instability the amplitude of oscillations grows exponentially .",
    "this is essentially different as compared to the motion of a charged particle in the circularly polarized plane wave and a constant magnetic field . in that case",

    "when the circularly polarized wave is replaced by a wave with a vortex , the set of linear _ inhomogeneous _ differential equations becomes a set of _ homogeneous _ equations with periodically varying coefficients .",
    "the driving force disappears but the coefficients of the equation become now time dependent and there appears a parametric resonance .",
    "its characteristic features are : the appearance of the whole regions of instability ( and not only discrete values as in the case of an ordinary resonance ) , which shrink to just one point ( @xmath131 ) when @xmath132 and an exponential growth of the amplitude in all regions of instability .",

    "the solutions of the equations of motion in the nonrelativistic regime can be obtained from the relativistic ones just by formally taking the limit @xmath40 . in this limit , the difference between the proper time and the laboratory time disappears .",
    "also , the wave frequency @xmath38 and the effective frequency @xmath76 become equal , because @xmath134 .",
    "the motion in the longitudinal direction completely decouples from the oscillations in the transverse plane . in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath135 . in this limit , the motion in the @xmath27 direction becomes a free motion described by the formula @xmath136 .",
