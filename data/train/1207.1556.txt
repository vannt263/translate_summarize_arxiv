    "extending from the wealth of phenomena occurring in transition - metal oxides , which has been studied already extensively in the last century ( see _ e.g._ref .  ) , compounds containing heavy transition - metal elements like iridium have recently attracted much interest .",
    "probably the most prominent example is the discovery of a @xmath0 mott - insulating state in the material sr@xmath2iro@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , various theoretical proposals ranging from the realization of the kitaev model in mott insulators  @xcite to `` tailoring '' potential topological insulators out of related materials  @xcite have been made . in the layered quasi - two - dimensional compound sr@xmath2iro@xmath4it",
    "is the interplay of crystal - field splitting , spin - orbit coupling , and electron - correlation effects that determines the @xmath5 electronic structure and leads to the realization of the complex @xmath0 mott - insulating weakly ferromagnetic ( canted antiferromagnetic ) state  @xcite .",
    "the very nature of this state also suggests that the low - energy electronic structure is susceptible to electron - lattice interactions ( distortions , phonons ) as well as changes in the magnetic structure  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ir - o bilayer compound sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3is expected to form a similar @xmath0 state while it is suggested to be very close to an insulator - metal transition and just on the verge of the mott - insulating region with a largely diminished gap  @xcite .",
    "while band - structure calculations indicate that the low - energy electronic structures of the two materials are overall similar  @xcite , their magnetic properties somewhat differ .",
    "magnetization measurements show a weakly ferromagnetic state in sr@xmath2iro@xmath4  @xcite ; the same is true for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 , yet , additionally a peculiar magnetization reversal at low temperatures has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the true nature of the magnetic structure has been revealed in a series of resonant x - ray magnetic scattering experiments .",
    "these have established that both sr@xmath2iro@xmath4and sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3actually order as commensurate antiferromagnets  @xcite , and in addition provide direct evidence in support of the @xmath0 model through the observation of extremely large @xmath6 branching ratios .",
    "one very significant difference between the two compounds , however , is that in sr@xmath2iro@xmath4the moments are confined to the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ( with a small canting ) , while in sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3they reorient to point along the @xmath9 axis  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that neutron diffraction experiments indicate that magnetic correlations may extend to significantly higher temperatures than indicated by the resonant x - ray scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments show pronounced differences in the spin excitation spectra of sr@xmath2iro@xmath4  @xcite and sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "given its entanglement with the magnetic properties it is important to provide a comparison of the low - energy electronic structure for the two compounds . a powerful experimental tool to determine the electronic spectrum is angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "while arpes data on sr@xmath2iro@xmath4have been reported previously  @xcite , until now such data on sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3were not available . therefore , in this article we report the low - energy electronic structure for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3measured by arpes and compare it to the available single - layer data as well as density - functional - theory band - structure calculations .",
    "we find an overall very good agreement between the experiment and the calculations for the bilayer compound , yet , the measured spectral weight from the @xmath0 states is extremely weak .",
    "moreover , while the distribution of spectral weight is markedly different from sr@xmath2iro@xmath4 , the data from both compounds are qualitatively similar and exhibit some disagreement with the calculations in the center of the brillouin zone .    .",
    "the high - symmetry points are denoted as in ref .  .",
    "the bullets ( @xmath10 ) indicate the local curvature maxima of the concave parts of the edcs .",
    "the arrows at the top of the figure denote the energies for which constant - energy maps are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : constantenergymaps ] . ]",
    "the studied single crystal of sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3was synthesized at the clarendon laboratory using a self - flux technique as described in ref .  .",
    "arpes experiments were performed at the baltazar laser - arpes facility using a laser - based angle - resolving time - of - flight analyzer and linearly polarized @xmath11  ev photons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-axis - oriented single crystal of sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3was cleaved and measured under ultra - high - vacuum conditions with a pressure below @xmath12  mbar at a temperature @xmath13  k. complementary partial areas of the brillouin zone were covered by a series of measurements with different sample orientations and the resulting spectra were normalized and combined to yield a full data set spanning more than an eighth of the brillouin zone .",
    "the energy and crystal - momentum resolution of the measurements are about @xmath14  mev and @xmath15  @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential was determined within an accuracy of about @xmath17  mev through a work - function estimate .",
    "mev ( _ top left _ ) and @xmath18  mev ( _ bottom right _ ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates the high - symmetry reciprocal - space line along which spectra are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : edcs ] and  [ fig : bandstructure ] . ]    figure  [ fig : edcs ] shows measured arpes spectra [ energy - distribution curves ( edcs ) ] along a line of high - symmetry points in reciprocal space . the insulating character of sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3is reflected in the lack of spectral weight around zero binding energy ( @xmath19 , no fermi surface ) . with increasing binding energy",
    "first a weak dispersive feature appears around the @xmath20 point indicated by the extremal edc curvature . at the center of the brillouin zone ( @xmath21 ) there seems to be a very weak `` intensity tail '' at low binding energy , yet , the first clear maximum at @xmath21 is found just above @xmath22  mev . while being rather flat in the close vicinity of @xmath21 , the spectral weight rather quickly shifts from this `` band '' to a feature at higher binding energies when departing from @xmath21 ( in every direction ) and",
    "finally forms a broad flat maximum located away from @xmath21 at @xmath23  mev .    a further overview over the spectral - weight distribution in the whole brillouin zone is provided in the constant - energy surfaces depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : constantenergymaps ] . in this context",
    ", it should be noted that the observed brillouin zone of sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3is smaller than expected for the originally determined tetragonal space group @xmath24 with an in - plane lattice constant @xmath25    @xcite .",
    "therefore , the near - surface electronic structure provides further evidence that at least at low temperatures sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3might feature similar coherent iro@xmath26 octahedra rotations as sr@xmath2iro@xmath4leading to a bigger tetragonal unit cell  @xcite or even have an orthorhombic structure as reported previously ( see , _ e.g._refs .   or  ) .",
    "the arpes data on sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3presented here are consistent with previous studies of the optical conductivity which showed an insulating state with a small gap  @xcite . to facilitate a further comparison , the arpes spectra for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3are depicted together with density - functional - theory band - structure calculations  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure](a ) . like in fig .",
    "[ fig : edcs ] , the bullets ( @xmath10 ) represent distinct maxima in the concave edc curvature .",
    "the high intensity above @xmath27  mev with the strong mode dispersing to about @xmath28  mev at @xmath21 show a remarkable agreement with the @xmath29 bands ( solid black lines ) predicted by the calculations .",
    "the distribution of the remaining spectral weight at lower energies has the same topology as the calculated @xmath0 bands ( solid red lines ) .",
    "hence , even though not all the bands could be clearly resolved in our experiment the data show a good overall agreement with the results of the calculations .    turning to the pronounced feature in the vicinity of @xmath21 the edcs reveal two modes originating at @xmath30  mev .",
    "an intense band strongly disperses towards the high - energy maximum indicated by the curvature maxima at @xmath31  mev , a second weakly dispersing band with only low intensity follows the low - energy onset between @xmath32  mev and @xmath33  mev .",
    "naturally , the fast dispersing feature is seen more clearly in the intensity distribution at fixed binding energies [ momentum - distribution curves ( mdcs ) ] .",
    "the mdcs along the high - symmetry lines close to @xmath21 can be well described by a model function consisting of two lorentzians .",
    "the resulting peak positions ( crosses , @xmath34 ) are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure](a ) .",
    "starting at @xmath30  mev they trace the intense band and overlap with the edc curvature maxima at higher binding energies .",
    "these features identified in the edcs and mdcs around @xmath21 are consistent with the calculated @xmath29 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "overall , we observe that all the @xmath0 bands carry very little spectral weight .",
    "while the bands around @xmath20 and a part of the bilayer - split bands around @xmath21 can still be recognized , the only sign of the predicted split - off bands at very low binding energies around @xmath21 might be the aforementioned almost vanishingly weak edc `` tail '' below @xmath35  mev ( cf .",
    "[ fig : edcs ] ) , whose signature , however , is too faint for any further analysis . owing to their weakness , the width of the occupied @xmath0 bands is difficult to determine .",
    "judging from the onset of spectral weight , given by the lowest - energy edc curvature maxima , one obtains a band width of about @xmath32  mev . yet , based on our data , it can not be excluded that several bands are hidden in the spectral region between about @xmath36  mev and @xmath37  mev .",
    "therefore , the most accurate estimate for a single @xmath0 band appears to be possible considering only the dispersion between @xmath20 and @xmath38 having a band width of about @xmath39  mev .    ) for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3[@xmath40  ev , @xmath13  k , this work , ( a ) ] and sr@xmath2iro@xmath4[@xmath41  ev , @xmath42  k , ref .  ,",
    "the solid lines represent the calculated band structures of ref .  .",
    "the red lines are @xmath0 bands , the black ones correspond to @xmath29 . in ( a ) the bullets ( @xmath10 )",
    "represent the local curvature maxima of the concave parts of the edcs ( cf .",
    "[ fig : edcs ] ) , the crosses ( @xmath34 ) indicate mdc peaks for binding energies between @xmath43  ev and @xmath44  ev in the vicinity of @xmath21 . ]",
    "our data on sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3also show a qualitative resemblance with the arpes data on sr@xmath2iro@xmath4  @xcite as there are clearly valence - band maxima at @xmath21 and @xmath20 where the latter is found at a lower binding energy . for a direct comparison the arpes data for sr@xmath2iro@xmath4(@xmath41  ev , @xmath42  k , ref .  ) and the calculated band structure of ref .",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure](b ) .",
    "contrary to the case of sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 , the details of the calculations seem to differ substantially from the data particularly close to the center of the brillouin zone and in the size of the predicted energy gap . in ref .",
    "it has been pointed out that the calculations reproduce the valence - band - maxima topology for this material . yet , the assignment of both the valence - band maxima at @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the @xmath0 bands  @xcite is ambiguous as in sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3the main spectral weight at @xmath21 seems to originate from the @xmath29 states . taking into account only the band connected to the valence - band maximum at @xmath20 ,",
    "the @xmath0 band width between @xmath20 and @xmath38 appears to be about @xmath45  mev which is rather close to our estimate for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 , while for both materials the calculated band width is about two to three times larger ( @xmath46  mev between @xmath20 and @xmath38 )  @xcite .",
    "the most pronounced difference between the arpes data of the single - layer and bilayer materials is the intensity found in the valence - band maxima  while for sr@xmath2iro@xmath4a high intensity is found in the valence - band maximum at @xmath20 , the low - energy spectral weight in sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3is substantially suppressed .",
    "the measurements of the optical conductivity and the calculated density of states  @xcite would suggest more similar results for both materials , but various effects could lead to the observed difference . in general , it could be related to varying photoemission cross - sections for the distinct photon energies used in the experiments  @xcite . however",
    ", this does not explain the weakness of the @xmath0 bands in sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3as they derive from the same ir @xmath5 states as the @xmath29 bands .",
    "also , there could be an effect from probing different out - of - plane crystal momenta in the not truely two - dimensional systems .",
    "additionally , the symmetry of the @xmath0 states could play a role in the photoemission process ",
    "however , the experiment was not performed in a specific high - symmetry geometry , which renders the substantial suppression of the intensity of the @xmath0 states due to that unlikely .",
    "eventually , the low intensity might be the result of a lack in suitable final states excitable by the rather low photon energy used in the experiment .",
    "future arpes experiments on both materials employing various photon energies and geometries could provide an answer to this open question .    concerning the peculiarities in the magnetic properties of these materials ,",
    "the observation of the ( qualitatively ) similar low - energy electronic structures in sr@xmath2iro@xmath4and sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3would suggest similar magnetic properties .",
    "however , different moment orderings can not be excluded either as long as the `` orbital order '' is similar  @xcite and might provide a reason for the marked differences observed in magnetization and muon - spin rotation  @xcite .",
    "also , as mentioned before , the rather good agreement of the data and band calculations for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3but not sr@xmath2iro@xmath4could be a hint for less pronounced electron correlations in the bilayer material consistent with the apparent departure from the spin - wave expectation observed in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we presented experimental arpes data on sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3and compared them to data on sr@xmath2iro@xmath4as well as band - structure calculations available in the literature .",
    "the data on both compounds are qualitatively similar , thus confirming the related electronic structures .",
    "the comparison with the calculations shows a very good overall agreement for sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 , thus confirming the @xmath0 insulating state in this material .",
    "however , the @xmath0 band width appears to be reduced as compared to the calculations and the observed @xmath0 bands carry very little spectral weight .",
    "further studies are required to elucidate the origin of this effect as well as the partial disagreement of the data and calculations for sr@xmath2iro@xmath4 .",
