    "the rich statistical mechanics of long - range interacting systems has been a subject of active study in recent years ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) . as for self - gravitating systems ,",
    "such systems have been understood to give rise generically to non - equilibrium states which evolve only on time - scales which diverge with the number of particles . the degree to which such `` quasi - stationary '' states ( qss )",
    "can be understood , and their properties predicted , by a statistical approach is a question which is inevitably posed . in this context a theory originally formulated by lynden - bell in the astrophysical context in the sixties @xcite , and which has been applied also in the study of two dimensional vortices @xcite , has seen revived interest in recent years .",
    "study notably of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) toy model , the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model which describes particles on a ring interacting by a cosine potential , showed that this theory can predict sometimes very accurately the properties of these states ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , and more generally manages to capture the qualitative dependence of the qss on initial conditions .",
    "while it is clear that the `` lb theory '' is not entirely adequate in general , these studies suggest that the basic physical principle behind it  maximization of an entropy subjected to the constraints appropriate to vlasov dynamics  is , at the very least , a reference point for understanding the out of equilibrium dynamics of these systems .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the view of this theory in the ( original ) context of the astrophysical literature , where it has simply been discarded as a completely inadequate , and basically irrelevant , theory @xcite .",
    "one recent study @xcite of three dimensional ( 3d ) self - gravitating systems concludes , however , that lb theory may indeed be relevant also to this case .",
    "this study shows that in a certain limited range of initial conditions the lb theory predicts well the density profiles of qss , and proposes an alternative theory to explain their properties in the regime where lb no longer works well .",
    "the same authors have shown that the same statements apply both to plasma systems @xcite and two - dimensional self - gravitating system @xcite , and , in a very recent article @xcite , have used the alternative theory to account for qss in the hmf model .    in this paper",
    "we study these issues in the so - called self gravitating `` sheet model '' ( sgs ) of particles in one dimension attracted by forces independent of separation .",
    "our main goal is to characterize more precisely than has been done previously the degree of validity of the lb theory in this model , which is one of the canonical toy models for the study of such systems , and to determine whether the properties of the qss can be characterized in a simple manner and perhaps understood when the lb theory does not apply . that this theory does not provide",
    "an adequate theory of qss in the sgs model is clear from the earliest studies of this issue  @xcite which indeed used this model to probe the possible validity of lb theory for 3d gravitating systems .",
    "more recently a study of these questions in the sgs model has been reported by yamaguchi @xcite , who finds reasonable agreement with lb in a certain range of initial conditions , and , like in the work of levin et al . mentioned above , proposes a modification of it to account for the qss observed in other cases .",
    "we will compare in detail our results to these previous works .",
    "studies of the sgs model in the astrophysical context go back at least as far as that of @xcite , and there have been numerous studies of it also in the statistical mechanics literature in the decades since .",
    "many of these studies focussed on the question of relaxation to the thermal equiiibrium of the model , for which the exact expression was first derived by rybicki @xcite .",
    "that this relaxation , like in other long - range systems , takes place very slowly , on a timescale which diverges with the number of particles , has been clear since the earliest works , but the precise time scale and parametric dependences thereof have been the subject of considerable study and even some controversy ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in a recent work @xcite on this question , we have established clearly that the relaxation time from a range of initial conditions depends _ linearly _ on the number of particles @xmath0 , arises because of `` resonances '' present in spatially inhomogeneous qss in 1d systems , but not in spatially homogeneous qss which occur in 1d systems such as the hmf model , where a faster scaling with @xmath0 is indeed observed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] while also showing a strong dependence on the intermediate qss state ( or states ) .",
    "besides the early and more recent studies cited above which consider the qss attained on the shorter mean - field time scales ( i.e. through violent relaxation ) and lb theory , there are also studies @xcite which argue that the assumption that qss always result from mean - field dynamics may not be always correct : starting from certain initial conditions the initial phase of relaxation is observed to lead to phase space densities which have large holes which rotate in phase space , which persist on the time scales of the simulations . in our analysis below we will examine this question carefully , as it is clearly of central importance to understand whether the formation of a qss is indeed a good description of the outcome of violent relaxation if one is comparing with a theory which , by construction , assumes such a outcome .    the article is organized as follows .",
    "first we will start in section [ sim ] with the definition of the model , and its numerical integration . in the following section [ theory ] we review the theory of violent relaxation of lynden - bell and",
    "describe our calculations of the predictions for the density profiles , and velocity and energy distributions .",
    "we will also introduce a simple set of  order parameters \" which we use to characterize the qss . in section [ ic ]",
    "we describe the specific class of initial conditions which we investigate . in section [ nume ]",
    "we report our numerical results , comparing them to the theoretical lb predictions . in the following section we confront our results with two proposals which have been made in the recent literature to explain the properties of qss when the lb is clearly inadequate .",
    "we also discuss our results briefly in the light of the kinetic theory for collisionless relaxation developed in @xcite ( and references therein ) . in our conclusions",
    "we summarize our findings and conclusions , and suggest some directions for further investigation in both 1d and 3d self - gravitating systems .",
    "we consider identical particles of mass @xmath1 in one dimension which are mutually attracted by a force independent of their separation , i.e. , the force on a particle @xmath2 due to a particle @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a couping constant . if the particles in one dimension are considered as infinitely thin parallel sheets in three dimensions interating by 3d newtonian gravity , it is simple to show that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is newton s constant and @xmath8 is the mass per unit surface area of the sheets . in a system of a finite number of such particles the total force acting on the @xmath9 particle at any time may be expressed as @xmath10 \\label{total - force}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the number of particles on the right of @xmath9 particle and @xmath12 for the left .",
    "the fact that the force is thus constant other than when particles cross leads to one of the very nice features of this toy model : its numerical integration requires only the solution of algebraic ( quadratic ) equations to determine the time of the next particle crossing .",
    "this means that the only limit on the precision of integration is that of the machine in solving such equations , and that no numerical parameters need be introduced .",
    "another simplification comes from the fact that , in one dimension , the crossing of two particles without discontinuity in the velocities is , up to labelling of the particles , equivalent to an elastic collision in which particles exchange velocities . if we are not interested in following the trajectories of individual particles , we can thus consider the system as consisting of particles on which the forces are constant in time [ and given by the initial value of ( [ total - force ] ) ] , and which undergo elastic collisions when they collide .",
    "the optimal way to treat this kind of problem is , as has been pointed out and discussed in detail in @xcite , by using a so - called `` heap - based '' algorithm , which uses an object called a `` heap '' to store in an ordered way the next crossing times of the pairs .",
    "this algorithm requires a number of operations of order @xmath13 to determine which of the @xmath14 pairs crosses next .",
    "given that the number of crossings per particle per unit time grows in proportion to @xmath0 , the simulation time thus grows in proportion to @xmath15 . as is common practice we will use the total energy ( which is conserved in the continuum model ) as a control parameter . for the longest simulations we report the error in total energy of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we very briefly recall the basics of the theory of lynden - bell , and describe how we calculate its predictions for different quantities , in the case of waterbag initial conditions .",
    "a statistical theory to describe the stationary states arising from violent relaxation through mean - field forces has been proposed by lynden - bell in 1967  @xcite .",
    "such states were proposed to arise from the relaxation of the coarse - grained phase space density to that derived by maximizing the entropy derived for the latter by  counting \" the ( fine - grained or  microscopic \" ) phase space configurations states consistent with the conservation laws imposed by the collisionless ( vlasov ) dynamics . for the case of an initial  water - bag \" phase space density ,",
    "i.e. , in which the microscopic phase space density has the same value everywhere it is non - zero , these conservation laws simply require the conservation of the phase space volume  occupied \" by this constant density , @xmath17 say .",
    "the calculation of the entropy is then equivalent to that for identical particles with a  fermionic \" exclusion , and gives ( in one dimension ) @xmath18 = \\int\\int \\bigg\\ { \\bar{n } \\ ,",
    "\\textrm{ln } \\ , \\bar{n}+(1-\\bar{n})\\textrm{ln}(1-\\bar{n } ) \\bigg\\ } dxdv \\label{lbentropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the coarse - grained phase space distribution in the macrocell at @xmath21 .",
    "maximization of ( [ lbentropy ] ) gives @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the energy density of phase - space element at @xmath21 .",
    "the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are lagrange multipliers associated with the conservation of the total mass @xmath26 , and total energy @xmath27 , of the system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean field potential generated by the mass density @xmath30 . except in the degenerate and non - degenerate limits , corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "respectively , it is not possible to solve these equations analytically to derive ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) for any given @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is , however , straightforward to do so numerically , as described in appendix [ findmubeta ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , although the prediction of lb theory for a water - bag initial condition depends in general on the three parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath17 , for the sgs model there is only one additional dimensionful quantity relevant in the continuum limit , the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "thus units can always be chosen so that two of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath17 are fixed , and the lb prediction can therefore depend non - trivially ( up to a rescaling ) only on _",
    "one parameter_. a convenient choice of this parameter , which we will use here , is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy of the system with mass @xmath26 and phase space density @xmath17 in the degenerate limit , i.e. , @xmath35 is the energy of the system above the degenerate limit normalized to the lowest energy possible for the same mass and phase space density .",
    "the expression for @xmath36 is given in appendix [ degenerate ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we next describe how we derive , once @xmath24 and @xmath25 are known , the lb predictions for the various quantities we will measure in our simulations .      using ( [ lbequation ] )",
    ", the poisson equation gives , @xmath37 where @xmath30 is the mass density profile ( which we will refer to simply as the  density profile \" ) .",
    "it is simple numerically to solve this ( second order differential ) equation for @xmath29 , and then to determine the mass density profile , using the boundary conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the velocity distribution may be written @xmath40 where @xmath41 is , up to a sign , the gravitational acceleration . using the poisson equation we have @xmath42 and therefore @xmath43 using the previously determined @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 using ( [ eqveloprofile1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of particle energies is defined by @xmath46)\\cdot \\bar{f}(x , v ) dxdv \\label{fe1}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 integrating we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of states at energy @xmath50 .    while the results for @xmath30 and @xmath51 do not depend on the choice of the zero point of the potential , this latter result does .",
    "it is straightforward numerically , to use , rather than @xmath52 , @xmath53 i.e. , that corresponding to a pair potential strictly proportional to the separation between particles . given that @xmath54 defined in ( [ a1 ] ) is necessarily positive for all @xmath55 , this is the minimum value of the potential ( and of the energy particle energy ) .",
    "adapting this definition the energy distribution is still given by ( [ conversion ] ) , but with @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58      in order to characterize and compare the macroscopic properties of qss it is convenient to calculate specific moments of the phase space distribution ( rather than to study always the full distribution ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite a particularly relevant choice can be normalized  crossed moments \" which give a measure of the  entanglement \" of the distribution in space and velocity coordinates , by considering @xmath59 for non - zero @xmath60 and @xmath24 , where @xmath61 estimated in the discrete system with @xmath0 particles as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the value measured for the particle @xmath2 .",
    "in thermal equilibrium the distribution function is separable , and so @xmath64 .",
    "further it can be shown easily @xcite that the thermal equilbrium solution at any energy is the unique separable stationary state , i.e. , all qss are non - separable .",
    "thus generically we expect these moments to be non - zero in a qss ( although any finite number of them can in principle vanish without implying separability ) .    here",
    "we will use specifically the two moments @xmath65 and @xmath66 to characterize and compare the qss we obtain in our numerical simulations , complemented when necessary by examination of the functions derived above and in some cases of the full phase space density .",
    "given the lb solutions determined above ( for waterbag initial conditions ) it is straightforward to calculate numerically the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 predicted by lb for this case .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ phi_lb ] as a function of the parameter @xmath35 ( which , as discussed above , can be taken as the single parameter on which the lb result depends ) .",
    "we note that both parameters are always negative but increase towards zero as we go to the non - degenerate limit .",
    "indeed in this limit the lb prediction tends to the ( separable ) thermal equilibrium solution .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we summarize now our principal conclusions :    * * attainment of qss in the sgs model : * in all cases we have considered qss do appear to be attained , but the time - scales for relaxation to them can vary very considerably . in some cases rotating  holes \" formed in the phase space density during the initial phase of violent relaxation ( @xmath67 ) survive for quite a long time , disappearing only on times scales of order ( @xmath68 ) . as on these latter time",
    "scales the system shows no apparent tendency to relax towards its thermodynamic equilibrium , we conclude that this is simply a manifestation of slow collisional relaxation , and does not imply that qss are not attained as argued by @xcite",
    ". a fuller study of the possible @xmath0 dependence of such relaxation would be useful to establish this conclusion more firmly ( but would be numerically challenging ) . * * lb theory in the sgs model : * as was clear already from early studies @xcite , and confirmed by more recent ones such as @xcite , lb theory is not an adequate theory for understanding fully , or even approximately , the properties of qss arising from violent relaxation in the sgs model _ for arbitrary initial conditions_. however , it is by no means an irrelevant theory to understanding these qss .",
    "our study of a quite broad range of initial conditions shows that the space of qss in this model divides quite neatly into two : those for which lb works to quite a good approximation , and those for which the phase space density is characterized by a degenerate core , taking a form generally quite close to the simple ansatz ( [ levin - ansatz ] ) proposed by levin et al .",
    "the initial conditions in the former class are either close to the degenerate limit , or in other cases characterized by initial virial ratio of order unity .",
    "these conditions are precisely those , in line with what has been described by levin et al . , which suppress resonances which otherwise act very efficiently to produce the degenerate core - halo structure .",
    "* * accuracy of predictions of qss in the sgs model : * while , as just described , the qss which result from violent relaxation divide into those which are close to the lb theory , on the one hand , or to the ansatz of levin et al .",
    ", on the other , the accuracy of the associated predictions is at best approximate : _ in no case _ do we see a perfect agreement with either lb theory or the ansatz ( [ levin - ansatz ] ) .",
    "we underline that in this respect the spatial distribution of mass @xmath30 and velocity distribution @xmath45 are rather poor tools for diagnosing the agreement between observations and theory , as they wash out deviations which are most pronounced in energy space .",
    "we have also noted the apparent coherence of our results with the qualitative predictions of the kinetic theory approach described in @xcite .",
    "numerous results in the literature on various other models ( see references in introduction ) for specific ranges of initial conditions suggest that these latter two conclusions , and probably the first also , might apply much more generally to long - range systems .",
    "further detailed investigation of such models , and in particular of broader classes of waterbag initial conditions like those considered here , or , for example ,  multi - level \" waterbag initial conditions would be required to establish if this is the case .    for the sgs it would be interesting to apply the analysis described by levin et al . to determine a prediction of the form ( [ levin - ansatz ] ) for different initial conditions , and see how well it does in approaching the observed qss . in this respect",
    "it is interesting perhaps to note that , at given value of @xmath35 this is a one parameter family of solutions , so that it predicts qss lying on a curve in the ( @xmath69 ) plane . in fig .",
    "[ double01 ] , we see that the qss obtained from the two parameter family of initial conditions at a fixed @xmath70 do approximately collapse onto a curve",
    ". we would expect the degree to which the simple ansatz ( [ levin - ansatz ] ) can fit the qss to be well characterized by determining the prediction it gives in this plane .    of particular interest",
    "is of course the original context of 3d self - gravitating systems , to which the initial study of @xcite for srw suggests these conclusions may indeed apply .",
    "as mentioned , however , the results reported have been based , in this case , on examination of the density profile @xmath30 alone , while the energy distribution is probably a finer diagnostic tool as we have seen here . in forthcoming work",
    "we will study this case , and discuss the possible relevance of our findings in the astrophysical context . in this respect",
    "we note one of the reasons why lb theory has not played  at least for what concerns it detailed predictions  a role in astrophysics is that these predictions depend on unobservable initial phase space densities .",
    "in contrast the prediction of a degenerate core in many cases would give a simple link between observations and initial conditions , which may be of practical relevance notably in constraining the parameters in theories of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the simulations were carried out in large part at the centre de calcul of the institut de physique nuclaire et physique des particules .",
    "we are particularly grateful to laurent le guillou for advice and help on use of these computing resources .",
    "we thank b. marcos for useful discussions , and p.h .",
    "chavanis for many helpful remarks , and in particular for suggesting the plot in fig .",
    "[ fexv_lb_log ] .",
    "in general @xmath24 and @xmath25 can not be calculated analytically , so we solve for them numerically as follows .",
    "the mass normalization ( [ mconstrain ] ) condition is @xmath71 integrating over @xmath72 , and changing the coordinate @xmath73 to @xmath74 just as in ( [ eqveloprofile1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 the total energy constraint ( [ econstrain ] ) , i.e. , @xmath76 can likewise be rewritten as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is total kinetic energy and @xmath79 is total potential energy .",
    "we can then use the virialization condition , @xmath80 , to obtain @xmath81 the determination of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the lb solution ( [ lbequation ] ) can then be cast as the problem of finding the solutions of the equations @xmath82 where @xmath83 following a standard method we write the matrix equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the infinitesimal changes of @xmath87 and @xmath7 when @xmath88 change to @xmath89 , we start by guessing a pair of @xmath88 and then determining the new @xmath90 using @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
