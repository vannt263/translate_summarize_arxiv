    "an extension of the model to the earliest evolutionary phases , when metals were first produced , requires a specific treatment of dust attenuation , which plays an important role in the derivation of high-@xmath7 galaxy properties , since even small amounts of dust strongly affect the rest - frame uv emission .",

    "etc . ) which occur on different linear and time scales .",
    "even with the more sophisticated numerical techniques , one has to resort to many simplifying assumptions to derive the star formation history , since these processes are extremely complex and occur on scales well below the currently achievable resolution of @xmath20-body@xmath21hydro simulations ( iliev et al .",

    "the model envisages that during or soon after the formation of the host dm halo , the baryons falling into the newly created potential well are shock - heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the hot gas is ( moderately ) clumpy and cools fast especially in the denser central regions , where rapid mergers of a fraction less than @xmath22 of the total mass yield strong bursts of star formation that can reach up to thousands solar masses per yr in massive halos at high redshift .",
    "such a huge star formation activity also promotes the storage of the cooled gas into a reservoir around the central supermassive bh , eventually leading to accretion onto it .",
    "the ensuing sn explosions and the nuclear activity feed energy back to the gaseous baryons , and regulate the sfr and the bh growth .",

[ fig|sfr : mstar ] ) , and of the mass stored in the central supermassive bh .",
    "when the star formation and the chemical evolution history of a galactic halo of mass @xmath24 have been computed , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as function of time from extreme uv to radio frequencies is estimated through the grasil code ( silva et al . 1998 ) .",

    "( 2004 ) model three basic ingredients : ( i ) the formation rate of galactic halos ; ( ii ) the star formation history as a function of halo mass and redshift , and the imf of stars ; ( iii ) the chemical evolution . these ingredients allow us to obtain the unattenuated spectral energy distribution as a function of galactic age .",
    "for the galaxies of interest here , which just begin to form their metals , we need a specific recipe for the attenuation . based on simple physical arguments",
    ", we have adopted a power - law relation between uv attenuation , sfr and metallicity [ eq .  ( [ eq|extgigi ] ) ] , tuned to fit the uv luminosity vs. @xmath14 correlation found by shapley et al . ( 2001 ) ; this uv attenuation turns out to be increasing with galactic age and with increasing galaxy mass . with this additional ingredient",
    "the model accounts also for the observed lfs of lbgs at different redshifts .",
    "the larger attenuation for more massive objects implies that the uv lf evolves between @xmath1 and @xmath173 much less than the halo mass function .",
    "this is due to the fact that the higher dust attenuation mitigates the fast increase with decreasing redshift of the number density of massive halos . as a consequence ,",
    "the uv lf is only weakly sensitive to the values of cosmological parameters , and in particular of @xmath174 .",
    "however , if lf estimates will be extended to @xmath73 , the effect of @xmath174 could be visible down to small enough masses for which the effect of attenuation is small .",
    "the derived uv lfs imply that lbg can account for a complete reionization at @xmath111 .",
    "most ionizing photons are produced by galaxies with halo masses in the range @xmath175 at @xmath176 , that dominate the faint portion of the uv lf .",
    "we expect that lbgs with detectable ly@xmath0 emission are on average much younger , less massive and less dusty , in agreement with the analysis of @xmath177 lbgs observed in the goods - s survey by pentericci et al .",
    "note , however , that a second ly@xmath0 bright phase may be expected at much later times , when the interstellar medium is being swept away by super - winds driven by the quasar feedback , allowing ly@xmath0 photons to escape from the galaxy ( see also thommes & meisenheimer 2005 ) .",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath178 ) of lbgs at @xmath2 are detected by deep x - ray surveys ( laird et al .",
    "2006 ; lehmer et al .",
    "x - ray luminosities estimated using stacking techniques are generally below @xmath179 , consistent with the luminosities due to the starburst activity ( type - ii sn remnants , hot gas , and high mass x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the small fraction of @xmath2 lbgs with @xmath180 generally shows properties of active nuclei .",
    "a single faint active nucleus was found by douglas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in a large sample of @xmath181 lbgs .",
    "our model implies that intense star formation activity is accompanied by an exponential growth of a supermassive bh at the galaxy center . the corresponding nuclear x - ray emission ( cf .",
    "granato et al .",
    "2006 ) can be written as : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency , @xmath184 is the bolometric correction for the @xmath185 kev band and @xmath186 is the accretion rate onto the supermassive bh . in the lbg phase",
    "the nuclear bhs are still very far from their final masses ( proportional to the halo masses ) and only those associated to halos at the upper limit of the range represented in the available samples ( @xmath134 , see fig .",
    "[ fig|ext_magn ] ) can reach eddington limited accretion rates large enough ( @xmath187 yr@xmath17 ) to yield @xmath188 erg s@xmath17 ( see fig . 1 of lapi et al .",
    "2006 ) ; the sfrs of these objects exceed @xmath189 ( fig .",
    "[ fig|sfr : mstar ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the model predicts that in more massive primeval galaxies during the late smb phase , the sfrs may reach thousands @xmath190 yr@xmath17 and correspondingly the nuclear accretion rates may attain tens @xmath190 yr@xmath17 .",
    "in fact , granato et al . (",
    "2006 ) have shown that the model successfully reproduces the x - ray observations of smb galaxies by alexander et al .",
    "( 2005a , b ) and borys et al .",

    "according to this model , the galaxies currently selected in ly@xmath0 ( @xmath196 erg s@xmath17 ) are very young ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig|lya ] ) , with typical ages up to @xmath197yr .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity range sampled by surveys carried out so far corresponds to a narrow distribution of halo masses around @xmath198 , and stellar masses ranging from @xmath199 to @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig|sfr : mstar ] ) . for given halo mass , ly@xmath0-selected galaxies have lower stellar masses than lbgs and their stars",
    "are preferentially formed in the densest central regions ; they are therefore expected to be more compact than lbgs , as is indeed observed ( dow - hygelund et al .",
    "galaxies with higher halo masses have higher ly@xmath0 luminosities but are rare because of the low number density of massive halos at high redshifts and of their short lifetime in the lae phase ; they are thus easily missed by the available surveys , covering very small areas .",
    "these rare objects would however have very interesting properties : high ly@xmath0 luminosity with very young ages , low metallicities and correspondingly high ly@xmath0 equivalent widths , low masses in stars within large halo masses . on the other hand , the lower luminosity portion of the lae lf",
    "is dominated by relatively older objects , more chemically evolved and with lower ly@xmath0 equivalent widths .",
    "therefore the extension to lower luminosities of the lae lf will depend rather critically on the minimum detectable equivalent width .",
    "both ly@xmath0-selected galaxies and lbgs are associated to relatively small dm halos and so that they are not expected to show strong clustering , consistent with the results by murayama et al .",

    "most of the star formation is associated to the lbg phase , but a substantial fraction of the galaxies with the highest star formation rates are predicted to be dust - obscured ( and therefore smb ) .",
    "this is because , in the present framework , the more massive galaxies have higher sfrs , yielding higher metallicities and higher dust attenuations . at redshift @xmath201 , however , the space density of smbs is very low .",
    "only later on , an increasing fraction of the cosmic sfr occurs in very dusty galaxies .",
    "since sfrs are strongly correlated with halo masses , smb galaxies are expected to show stronger clustering , consistent with the results by blain et al .",
