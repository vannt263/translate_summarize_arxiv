    "in 1970-th hemmer and stell introduced a model system which can effectively approximate real substances @xcite .",
    "the model they introduced belongs to the class of potentials which nowadays is called core - softened potentials , i.e. the system with softening of the repulsive part of interparticle interaction .",
    "hemmer and stell showed that such systems can demonstrate some unusual phase transitions - transition between two crystal phases of the same symmetry @xcite which ends in a critical point similar to the gas - liquid one , and liquid - liquid phase transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed that the high density transition with critical point qualitatively represents the isostructural transition in ce and cs .",
    "great interest to this kind of systems appeared after hemmer and stell publications .",
    "many researchers studied this model or proposed other core - softened model potentials .",
    "young and alder carried out simulation of collapsing spheres ( cs ) system which is defined as @xmath0 if @xmath1 , @xmath2 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 otherwise @xcite . because of the computer power restrictions they managed to estimate the melting line of the system only in two - dimensional case . according to their s results the melting line demonstrates a maximum .",
    "they pointed out the similarity of the phase diagrams of the collapsing spheres system and experimental phase diagram of ce and cs .",
    "however , young and alder did not consider solid - solid phase transformation of collapsing spheres .",
    "this was done by bolhuis and frenkel who studied the cs system by monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "they considered isostructural fcc - fcc transition in the collapsing spheres and square well systems .",
    "as it was shown in the cited paper , the isostructural transition takes place in both systems for sufficiently small soft core or square well widths .",
    "if the width of the soft core ( well ) increases the solid - solid transition disappears .",
    "velasco et al . studied the collapsing spheres system in the frame of thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "their s results are in good agrement with the bolhuis and frenkel publication @xcite .",
    "they considered four values of the step width : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . according to their s findings",
    "the first three systems demonstrate the isostructural solid - solid transformation with critical point while the last system does not have this transition . at the same time",
    "an fcc - bcc - fcc sequence occurs in the system with the largest step size",
    ".    the qualitative phase behavior of collapsing spheres was studied by stishov @xcite .",
    "this article makes a qualitative estimation of the collapsing spheres phase diagram basing on the high- and low- temperature limits .",
    "it was shown that depending on the @xmath7 ratio the phase diagram can change dramatically .",
    "this qualitative consideration is in good agreement with monte - carlo simulation @xcite and perturbation theory results @xcite mentioned above . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was discussed the possibility of the liquid - liquid phase transition in cs system .",
    "one can use the geometrical reasons to identify the possible structures of the core softened systems .",
    "this method was applied by jagla to a set of systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "a parameter dependent potential was considered . depending on the value of the tuning parameter",
    "it can be continuously changed from a hard core plus linear ramp shape to hard core plus repulsive shoulder one .",
    "the minimal energy configurations corresponding to different pressures for the different potentials were monitored .",
    "it was established that depending on the pressure the number of overlaps of the soft core changes producing a large number of possible geometrical configurations ( fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "basing on this argument one can expect a rich variety of structures in the core softened systems both in crystalline and disordered regions .",
    "although the main focus of ref .",
    "@xcite was on two - dimensional systems , the results were also generalized for three - dimensional case ( fig . 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "these results clearly state that the crystalline region of the linear ramp system demonstrates many phases with different symmetry .",
    "this fact identifies that core - softening is a very strong mechanism affecting the phase behavior of the system .",
    "the minimum energy configurations in the two - dimensional collapsing spheres system was revised later in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper the mc simulation of the system",
    "was also carried out and complex phase behavior in liquid phase was observed .",
    "depending on the density , the system can form different cluster phases .",
    "in particular , long stripe clusters were observed at some densities and temperatures .",
    "the same system of two - dimensional collapsing spheres was studied further in ref .",
    "the stripe phases for a set of the step widths were observed .",
    "the authors pointed out that the stripe phase takes place only for some particular values of the step width .",
    "although the paper was mainly focused on the two - dimensional system the authors claim that the conclusions are applicable for the three dimensional case too .",
    "another soft core softened model in two dimensions was considered by camp @xcite .",
    "phase diagram obtained from npt - mc was reported .",
    "this phase diagram consists from low- and high density solid phases , normal liquid and cluster liquid .",
    "the cluster liquid represents the stripe phase .",
    "interestingly , the stripe phases were observed experimentally in the system of colloids in magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the configurations observed in this system closely resemble the ones obtained by camp @xcite .",
    "this justifies that the core - softened models can be successfully applied to the real experimental systems .",
    "a strong method of the ground state phase calculation was developed in refs .",
    "this method allows to find the minimal energy configurations by applying generic algorithms carrying out the minimization .",
    "the collapsing sphere system with different step widths was considered in refs .",
    "three values of the step were considered : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown that the complexity of the system increases dramatically with increasing the step size .",
    "for example , for the system with @xmath8 the number of phases reported in @xcite is @xmath11 , for @xmath9 - @xmath12 and for @xmath10 - @xmath13 .    in our recent paper a smoothed repulsive shoulder system ( rss )",
    "was introduced @xcite .",

    "the dependence of the phase diagram on @xmath16 was studied .",
    "the following values of @xmath16 were considered : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath20 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in agreement with previous discussion ,",
    "the behavior of the system was found to be very complex .",
    "if the step width is relatively small then the crystalline region consists of low- and high density fcc phases separated by a bcc region",
    ". however , already at @xmath21 the complexity of the phase diagram greatly increases .",
    "it is important to note that several crystalline structures appear in the system including not close packed structures which can not be observed in lj - like systems . comparing the phase diagrams for @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath22",
    ", one can see that the complexity of the phase diagram even increases with increasing the step width .",
    "later the ground state of the rss with @xmath21 was studied in the work @xcite .",
    "the set of the phases reported in this work is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "it can be related to the different choice of the phases the authors of these papers considered to be potentially stable .",
    "one can see that the behavior of the purely repulsive core - softened models is rather complex",
    ". however , the potentials of interaction between real particles have both repulsive and attractive parts . to take it into account one",
    "should add an attractive well to the repulsive core - softened model .",
    "the potentials of this type were reported as models of water , liquid metals , colloidal particles or polymer colloid mixtures and so on .",
    "this makes them important for the soft matter science and attracts much attention to such systems .",
    "the simplest core - softened system with attraction is the collapsing spheres system with additional attractive well ( csaw ) :    @xmath23    liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) was found in such systems .",
    "llpt in csaw systems was intensively studied by molecular dynamics , integral equations theory and perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it was found that llpt takes place only at some specific values of parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , as far as we know , all papers on this topic suggest that llpt is metastable with respect to crystallization .",
    "this makes extremely important to know also the melting line of the system .",
    "however , just a few publications consider the crystalline region of the phase diagram @xcite .    in the paper @xcite the llpt in csaw",
    "was studied .",
    "the authors also investigated possible crystal structures in the system .",
    "they came to the conclusion that only one crystal phase is possible in the range of densities they considered . taking into account huge variety of phases in the purely repulsive systems this conclusion looks rather surprising and makes it necessary to carry out further investigations of the influence of repulsive and attractive forces on the phase diagram of a model system .",
    "a detailed study of the phase diagrams of a family of core - softened systems with attractive well was carried out by quigley and probert @xcite . the potential used in their s works consisted of lennard - jones part plus a gaussian well .",
    "choosing different parameters they changed the depth of the well and monitored the changes in the phase diagram .",
    "it was shown that fcc is not the only stable crystal structure for this kind of potentials .",
    "simple hexagonal structure was also reported @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a detailed study of the influence of attractive and repulsive forces on the phase diagram of a core - softened system .",
    "for doing this we carry out the calculations of the phase diagrams of a set of systems which have the same functional form of the interatomic potential but parameters of this potential are different . in the present article we focus on the melting line of the system and the transformations between different crystal phases .",
    "we also consider the influence of attraction on the thermodynamic anomalies in the core softened system .",
    "in the present study a system of particles interacting via the potential with `` hard '' core , repulsive shoulder and attractive well is investigated .",
    "this potential represents a generalization of our previous rss model @xcite and we call it repulsive shoulder system with attractive well ( rss - aw ) potential",

    "the problem of anomalous behavior of isotropic core softened system with attraction has already been discussed by several authors @xcite .    in the recent publications @xcite the characteristic length and energies of the interatomic potential",
    "were fixed while the softness of the potential varied .",
    "it means that the focus of these publications is slightly different comparing with the present one .",
    "the authors found anomalous behavior in the system they studied in a wide range of the potential parameters .    in the publication",
    "@xcite the depth of attractive well is varied with all other parameters fixed . in this sense",
    "this work is very close to the present one .",

    "one can see from these figures that the density range of anomalous diffusion does not change on increasing the well depth . at the same time",
    "the maximum temperature of anomalous behavior increases .",
    "it means that small attraction stabilizes anomalous diffusion in the system .    in order to see the origin of the difference in the qualitative behavior of diffusion anomaly region between the present work and the publication",
    "@xcite we should notice that in our case the increasing of the well depth at the same time makes the potential softer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to making the parameter @xmath87 , which controls the slope of the potential in the works @xcite , smaller . accordingly to these publications the anomalous region is wider for the smaller values of this parameter .",

    "the present article shows the evolution of the phase diagrams of two core - softened systems with addition of attractive forces .",
    "it is shown that the general shape of the phase diagram and the set of preferable structures is mostly defined by repulsive shoulder while attractive well just shifts the phase diagram in @xmath58 plane .",
