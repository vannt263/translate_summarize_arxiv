    "the casimir effect arises from the distortion of the zero - point energy of a quantum field due to the presence of non - trivial background fields or the imposition of non - trivial boundary conditions .",
    "this effect was first proposed by casimir in 1948 @xcite , when he predicted the existence of an attractive force between two neutral infinite parallel metallic plates in a vacuum , placed a few micrometers apart . since casimir s work , this effect has attracted much interest and many authors have calculated the casimir energy and the resulting force caused by the presence of non - trivial boundary conditions for various geometries such as parallel plates , cylinders , and spheres @xcite and other geometries @xcite . moreover , they have used many different regularization and analytic continuation schemes to remove the divergences .",
    "some of these techniques are the heat - kernel method @xcite , the green function formalism @xcite , the mode number summation method combined with the zeta function analytic continuation technique @xcite , and the multiple scattering expansions @xcite . the first experimental attempt to observe this phenomenon",
    "was conducted by marcus sparnaay @xcite in 1958 . in this experiment two parallel metallic plates were used , and the results had a very poor accuracy . in 1997 , steve k. lamoreaux @xcite measured the casimir energy with a high accuracy using a plate and a metallic spherical shell , and this was the first successful experiment to verify the casimir effect . since then",
    ", many different experiments have been performed to measure the casimir energy for various geometries @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", the zero - point energy can also be affected by the presence of non - trivial background fields .",
    "the background field is usually chosen to be a soliton .",
    "also sometimes a very simple potential such as an electric potential well is chosen as the background field .",
    "this simple choice renders the problems of vacuum polarization and the casimir energy exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy also contributes to the lowest order quantum correction to the mass of the soliton .",
    "many authors use this correction for models containing solitons such as supersymmetric solitons @xcite . for most of the models with solitons ,",
    "the problem is not exactly solvable .",
    "sometimes indirect methods such as the phase shift method which relates the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the momentum to the spectral deficiency in the continuum states are used to calculate the casimir energy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the casimir energy for a system containing a fermi field chirally coupled to a pseudoscalar field which is prescribed and has the form of an isolated kink . in a previous work @xcite we calculated the casimir energy for a similar system where the soliton profile is approximated by a piece - wise linear function , and this renders the problem exactly solvable .",
    "the vacuum polarization for that model has also been calculated @xcite . for that problem we calculated the casimir energy exactly and directly by subtracting the vacuum energy of the system in the absence from the presence of the disturbance which is the pseudoscalar field . throughout this paper",
    "we shall refer to that model as the simple exactly solvable model . however , the present model is not analytically solvable and we use the phase shift method to compute the casimir energy .",
    "as usually happens , the presence of the disturbance , e.g. the kink , leads to the appearance of one or more discrete bound states and also changes the continuum wavefunctions as compared to the free case .",
    "these changes have many manifestations including induced vacuum polarization and casimir energy of the system .",
    "we have previously investigated a similar system where neither the fermi field nor the pseudoscalar field , with boundary values of a topologically non - trivial configuration , were prescribed .",
    "they were allowed to interact and the non - perturbative final results , i.e. the results beyond the first order ",
    "back reaction \" ones , revealed that the actual solitary wave profile differs only very slightly from an isolated kink @xcite .",
    "this proximity is one of our motivations to study the properties of the coupled fermion - kink system .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to investigate how the functional form of a pseudoscalar background field ( @xmath1 ) affects the properties of the coupled fermion - pseudoscalar field system . some of these effects have already been investigated ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "for example it is well known that changing the value of @xmath1 at spatial infinity ( @xmath9 ) affects the spectral deficiency in the continua , and this usually leads to what is called the adiabatic contribution to the induced vacuum polarization @xcite . moreover , changing the spatial profile of the background field close to the center e.g. the value of the slope of @xmath1 at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , changes the pattern of energy levels crossing @xmath5 .",
    "these crossings lead to what is usually called the non - adiabatic contribution to the vacuum polarization @xcite .",
    "the same changes in the spectrum of the system that lead to the induced vacuum polarization , also affect its casimir energy . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the functional form of @xmath1 on the casimir energy and stability of the system . in order to accomplish this we meticulously study and compare the properties of the system which has the kink as the background field with those of the simple exactly solvable model .",
    "for the comparison to be meaningful and refined , we choose both background fields to have the same @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in other words , this comparison serves a dual purpose : we not only investigate the behavior of the systems as a function of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 , but also investigate the difference between these two systems for the same parameters .",
    "the latter investigation allows us to explore the effect of the finer details of @xmath1 on the overall properties of the system .    in section 2",
    "we briefly explain how to find the continuum scattering wavefunctions of this system using the runge - kutta - fehlberg method of order 6 .",
    "then , in section 3 we compute the phase shifts . using the relation between the phase shift and the difference between the density of states in the presence and absence of the disturbance ,",
    "we can write an expression for the casimir energy in terms of the phase shift . we then calculate and plot the casimir energy as a function of the parameters of the pseudoscalar field , i.e. the slope of the pseudoscalar field @xmath1 at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the value of the field at infinity ( @xmath4 ) . in both cases",
    "we also show the results for the simple exactly solvable model , for comparison . in section 4",
    "we add the casimir energy to the energy of a system consisting of a valence fermion in the ground state , when there is a soliton as the background field and discuss the stability of the system . for each result",
    "obtained and displayed for our model , we also present the corresponding results of the simple exactly solvable model , for comparison . in section 5 we summarize and discuss our conclusions .",
    "we consider the coupling of a fermi field and a pseudoscalar field governed by the following lagrangian @xmath10 and we choose @xmath1 to be prescribed in the form of @xmath11 $ ] which is an isolated kink .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the mass of the fermi and pseudoscalar field , respectively .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the casimir energy of this system . for exactly solvable systems we usually compute the complete spectrum of the fermion , including the bound states with their discrete energies and the continuum states , and then we can calculate the casimir energy directly by subtracting the vacuum energy of the system in the presence and absence of the disturbance .",
    "however , the form chosen for the @xmath1 makes the euler - lagrange equation of @xmath14 analytically unsolvable .",
    "therefore , we have to use an appropriate numerical method to find the fermion spectrum . in order to facilitate the numerical calculations , we take advantage of the solutions of the exactly solvable model for choosing the initial values as well as comparison purposes .",
    "the lagrangian for the simple exactly solvable model mentioned earlier is also the one shown in eq.([e1 ] ) .",
    "however , the form chosen for @xmath1 is a piece - wise linear which renders the problem exactly solvable .",
    "the @xmath1 for this model is as follows @xmath15 this form for the pseudoscalar field along with the kink is shown in fig.([kinkdr ] ) . in this figure",
    "we indicate the parameters @xmath3 , the slope of @xmath1 at @xmath2 , and @xmath9 , its values at the boundaries .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show @xmath1 for the kink and the simple exactly solvable model , respectively . the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 are also shown in the figure.,width=260 ]      the spectrum of a dirac field coupled to a background field gets distorted as compared to the free case .",
    "these distortions can be observed as spectral deficiencies in the continua and also the bound states could appear due to the presence of the background field .",
    "choosing the representation @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the dirac matrices , the dirac equation for the lagrangian of eq.([e1 ] ) becomes @xmath19\\psi = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",
    "we define @xmath21 the equation obeyed by @xmath22 is @xmath23 in order to obtain the energies of the bound states of the fermion , we use a numerical method called the relaxation method ( in an earlier paper @xcite we have considered the bound states of this system in detail ) .",
    "this method is used for solving the boundary value problems . to solve",
    "@xmath24 real coupled first - order odes , we need @xmath24 boundary conditions , some of them are to be imposed at one boundary and the rest at the other boundary .",
    "the relaxation method determines the solution by starting with a guess and improving it , iteratively .",
    "we separate the real and imaginary parts of the upper and lower components of @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the equations of motion for @xmath28s are as follows @xmath29 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we have an additional ( fifth ) equation @xmath30 . to solve this set of five coupled first - order odes",
    "we need five conditions on the initial and final boundary points of the domain of the spatial variable , which could be chosen to be just @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 , due to the invariance of the lagrangian under the parity .",
    "then , we map the @xmath0-interval @xmath31 to @xmath33 $ ] by the transformation @xmath34 . hence , the two boundaries of @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for bound states we use the relaxation method and choose the conditions at these boundaries as follows . at @xmath36",
    "we choose two conditions : one parity condition and one assigning a value to one of the @xmath38s .",
    "this value is allowed to change so as to normalized @xmath39 . at @xmath40",
    "we choose three conditions : three of the @xmath41s are set to zero . from now on we rescale all the quantities of the problem with respect to the mass of the fermi field ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "some examples of the bound states obtained from numerical results are depicted in fig.([bnd ] ) .",
    "the upper graph shows the bound energy levels of the fermion as a function of @xmath3 at @xmath42 , i.e. a soliton with winding number 1 and the lower graph shows the bound energies as a function of @xmath4 for the slope @xmath43 . in both graphs the bound energy levels for the model with kink and the simple exactly solvable model are shown by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the @xmath44 signs refer to the parity of each of the bound states .",
    "notice that the rather small difference between the profiles of these two background fields produces considerable difference between the pattern of bound state energies .",
    "the energies of the bound states of the fermion .",
    "the upper graph shows the bound energies as a function of @xmath3 at @xmath42 and the lower graph shows the bound energies as a function of @xmath4 at @xmath43 . in both graphs the solid and dashed lines are for the model with kink and the exactly solvable model , respectively .",
    "the parity of each bound state is indicated on the graphs by @xmath44 signs.,width=249 ]      now we focus on the continuum states .",
    "we can obtain the eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the system , which can be chosen to be also the parity eigenstates .",
    "these solutions have to satisfy the parity condition @xmath45 .",
    "however , we obtain the wavefunctions which describe the scattering of a plane wave incident on the scattering region from the left , instead .",
    "the reason for obtaining the scattering solutions instead of the parity eigenstates is as follows . in the scattering process",
    "the wavefunctions on the right - hand side , far enough from the scattering region , have the @xmath0-dependence in the form of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , by extracting the factor @xmath46 from the solution , the remaining part of the solution on the far right would approach a constant , independent of the spatial variable and this will simplify the numerical analysis considerably .",
    "we choose the wavefunction for the scattering process to be in the form @xmath47 where in general @xmath48s are real functions of @xmath0 .",
    "then , the equations of motion satisfied by @xmath48s would be in the following form @xmath49    this set of equations for the form chosen for @xmath1 , which is kink , can not be solved analytically .",
    "thus , we use again an appropriate numerical method .",
    "our purpose is to find the scattering solutions of the system , not the parity eigenstates .",
    "therefore , we need to find the wavefunctions for the whole interval @xmath32 .",
    "we solve this set as an initial value problem , using the so - called runge - kutta methods . in order to find the solutions with high accuracy",
    ", we use the runge - kutta - fehlberg method of order 6 .",
    "we take advantage of the simple exactly solvable model to determine the initial boundary values for solving the equations .",
    "we already have all the solutions of this model , including the wavefunctions for the scattering process @xcite .",
    "since the form chosen for the pseudoscalar field is similar to kink as the spatial variable @xmath0 tends to infinity , we can use the values of the scattering wavefunctions of this simple model as the initial boundary conditions for our model .",
    "therefore , we start at @xmath50 with the values of the scattering wavefunctions for the exactly solvable model ( after dropping the factor @xmath46 and up to the normalization factor ) and go backward in the @xmath0-interval to find the values of the @xmath48s for all the mesh - points of the interval @xmath32 by solving eqs.([e7]-[e74 ] ) . figure ( [ fig.1 ] ) shows @xmath48s for the case with the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this figure also shows @xmath48s of the simple exactly solvable model , for comparison .",
    "note that the oscillations are less pronounced on the left for the kink model .",
    "this indicates that there is less `` reflection '' from the kink , as is also evident from the graph of @xmath53 shown in fig.([density ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the kink is totally reflectionless for the elementary bosons within the @xmath54 theory .",

    "the solid and dashed lines show the @xmath53 for our model and the simple exactly solvable model , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations on the left is proportional to the probability of `` reflection '' and the amplitude on the right is proportional to the `` transmission '' probability . ]",
    "the casimir energy for a system like ours , as is well - known , is given by the shift in the zero - point energies of fermionic modes due to the presence of the disturbance , and in general can be written in the following form @xmath56 the first equality is the relation we derived in @xcite for the casimir energy of a fermi field in the presence of an arbitrary disturbance .",
    "the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the normalized fermion wavefunctions for the negative continuum states in the presence and absence of the disturbance , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath59 are the normalized fermion wavefunctions for the discrete bound states with negative energy and @xmath60 denote the energies of these negative bound states . in the last line of the above equation ,",
    "the extra @xmath61 takes into account the contribution from the half - bound state of the fermion at @xmath62 in the free case .",
    "the factor @xmath63 is the difference between the density of continuum states with negative energy in the presence and absence of the pseudoscalar field .",
    "in @xcite we concluded that for the simple exactly solvable model we can calculate the casimir energy only from the negative states or only the positive states , or the average of all of the states and the results are exactly the same in all cases .",
    "since all the symmetries of the model with kink are the same as the simple exactly solvable model , the aforementioned argument is also true for the present model .",
    "the difference between the density of the continuum states in the free and interacting cases can be written in terms of the scattering phase shift in the following form @xmath64 where @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 sums over the contributions from both positive and negative energies .",
    "this relation is also true for the sea and sky , separately .",
    "therefore , the second term in the relation of the casimir energy , eq.([e2 ] ) , can be written in terms of the phase shift , as follows @xmath67 in the second equality we have just subtracted a zero term from the original one . for the last equality we have integrated the expression by parts , since the final expression is more convenient for the numerical analysis .",
    "therefore , we can compute the second term in the expression of the casimir energy using the phase shift .",
    "now , by comparing the coefficients of @xmath46 on the left- and right - hand sides of the scattering region , we can obtain the scattering matrix element , which is related to the phase shift as @xmath68 .",
    "we know that for @xmath69 the wavefunction would be a linear combination of @xmath46 and @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the coefficients of @xmath46 on the left - hand side , we define the wavefunction of the far left as follows @xmath71 where @xmath48s on the right - hand side are obtained from the numerical method for @xmath69 . since this relation has been written for the left - hand side and far from the scattering region , all the elements @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constants , independent of the spatial variable @xmath0 .",
    "the wavefunction in the left - hand side of eq.([e9 ] ) has to satisfy the first - order equations of motion ( eq.([e5 ] ) ) when @xmath0 tends to minus infinity in this set of equations .",
    "using the relation obtained from the substitution of this wavefunction into eq.([e5 ] ) and using eq.([e9 ] ) , we can obtain all the constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is important to note that in the numerical computations we can only approach @xmath74 or equivalently @xmath75 .",
    "this decreases the accuracy , when the slope of @xmath1 at @xmath2 is very small , since in this case the region of variation of the pseudoscalar field becomes extended .",
    "now we check the consistency of the resulting phase shifts with the levinson theorem .",
    "the weak form of this theorem for the dirac equation is as follows @xcite @xmath76+[\\delta_{\\mathrm{sea}}(0)-\\delta_{\\mathrm{sea}}(\\infty)]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left(n+\\frac{n_\\mathrm{t}}{2}-\\frac{n_\\mathrm{t}^0}{2}\\right)\\pi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the total number of bound states , including positive and negative ones , @xmath77 the total number of the threshold bound states at the given strength of the potential , and @xmath78 the number of bound states at zero strength of the potential , i.e. the free dirac case .",
    "the strong form of the levinson theorem relates the value of the phase shift at each boundary of the continua to the number of levels which have crossed those boundaries , in the process of building up the disturbance .",
    "this form of theorem can be expressed in the following form for @xmath79 @xmath80 this relation holds for each of the continua , separately . for each continuum",
    "@xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the number of the bound states that exit ( enter ) that continuum from that boundary ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) as the strength of the potential is increased from zero to its final finite value . in this equation",
    "the threshold bound states , mentioned above , should be included in @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with the coefficient @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the strong form of the levinson theorem for @xmath86 can be written in the following form @xmath87 this relation also holds for each continuum , separately .",

    "<S> we compute the casimir energy for a system consisting of a fermion and a pseudoscalar field in the form of a prescribed kink . </S>",

    "<S> we use the relaxation method to find the bound states and the runge - kutta - fehlberg method to obtain the scattering wavefunctions of the fermion in the whole interval of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase shifts are consistent with the weak and strong forms of the levinson theorem . </S>",
    "<S> then , we compute and plot the casimir energy as a function of the parameters of the pseudoscalar field , i.e. the slope of @xmath1 at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the value of @xmath1 at infinity ( @xmath4 ) . in the graph of the casimir energy as a function of @xmath3 there is a sharp maximum occurring when the fermion bound state energy crosses the line of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this graph shows that the casimir energy goes to zero for @xmath6 , and also for @xmath7 when @xmath4 is an integer multiple of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the graph of the casimir energy as a function of @xmath4 shows that this energy is on the average an increasing function of @xmath4 and has a cusp whenever there is a zero fermionic mode . </S>",
    "<S> we finally compute the total energy of a system consisting of a valence fermion in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we show that this energy ( the sum of the casimir energy and the energy of the fermion ) is minimum when the background field has winding number one , independent of the details of the background profile . throughout the paper </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those of a simple exactly solvable model , where a piece - wise linear profile approximates the kink . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the kink is an almost reflectionless barrier for the fermions , within the context of our model . </S>"
