    "symbiotic stars ( sss ) are the widest interacting binaries , whose orbital periods run from hundreds of days to hundreds of years .",
    "they consist of an evolved red giant ( rg ) as the donor star and a white dwarf ( wd ) accreting from the giant s wind .",
    "the accretion process heats up the wd to @xmath0k and increases its luminosity to @xmath1@xmath2 , which by return ionizes a fraction of the neutral wind from the giant giving rise to the nebular radiation ( seaquist  @xcite , hereafter stb ) .    in most cases ,",
    "the observed large energetic output is believed to be caused by stable nuclear hydrogen burning on the wd surface , which requires accretion onto a low mass wd at @xmath3@xmath4  ( e.g. shen & bildsten @xcite ) .",
    "however , such high accretion rates can not be achieved by a standard bondi - hoyle wind accretion , because of its small efficiency ( bondi & hoyle @xcite ) , and the mass - loss rates of @xmath5@xmath4  from rgs in s - type sss ( e.g. seaquist  @xcite ) .",
    "this problem was pointed already by kenyon & gallagher ( @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we introduce principle of methods to estimate the mas - loss rate from rgs in sss ( sect .  2 ) , and possible solutions of the required high mass - transfer ratio ( sect .  3 )",
    "mass - loss rates from giants in symbiotic binaries can be determined in the context of the stb model by measuring the wind nebular emission during quiescent phase .",
    "the extent of the ionized rg wind is given by a parametric equation , @xmath6 the solution of which defines the hi / hii boundary at the orbital plane determined by polar coordinates ( @xmath7 ) centered at the hot star for a stationary binary .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is given by the binary properties and the wind mas - loss rate , @xmath9 ( see stb ) . figure  1 depicts the stb ionization structure and the corresponding typical uv / near - ir sed of sss . measuring the radio emission at 3.6 cm for a sample of 99 sss ,",
    "seaquist  ( @xcite ) derived @xmath10@xmath4 .    in the uv / optical / near - ir",
    ", the nebular emission can be obtained by modelling the sed ( see example in fig .  1 , right ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can calculate the nebular emission by integrating contributions throughout the volume of the fully ionized zone ( see fig .  1 , left ) , which depends on parameters of the giant s wind . comparing the observed and calculated continuum nebular emission",
    ", we get @xmath9 for a given wind terminal velocity . in this way",
    ", skopal ( @xcite ) determined @xmath9 = a few @xmath11@xmath4   for giants in 15 well observed s - type sss .",
    "@xmath9 can also be determined by probing directly the neutral fraction of the rg wind in sss . here , raman scattering of the far - uv line photons on atomic hydrogen in the wind is investigated .",
    "the key parameter is the efficiency of this process , defined as the ratio between the raman scattered and the original line photons .",
    "the raman scattering efficiency defines the so - called ` covering factor ' @xmath12 , which represents a fraction of the sky ` seen ' from the emission zone located predominately near the hot component , which is covered by the raman scattering region . assuming the stb geometry for the neutral zone",
    ", we can express @xmath12 via a solid angle @xmath13 , under which the initial line photons can ` see ' the scattering region , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the opening angle of the raman scattering region .",
    "if the stb neutral zone is optically thick for raman scattering , then @xmath16 , which determines unambiguously the parameter @xmath8 ( see fig .  1 , left ) . otherwise , one has to reconstruct @xmath17 from @xmath15 taking into account optically thick conditions for the investigated raman scattering conversion .",
    "finally , having the parameter @xmath8 and the fundamental parameters of the hot component , one can derive @xmath9 . using raman heii@xmath18 conversion we determined @xmath19@xmath4   for the mira - type variable in v1016  cyg",

    "the long - standing problem of the large energetic output from the majority of hot components in symbiotic binaries and their deficient fueling by the rg s wind in the canonical bondi - hoyle picture was recently approached in two ways .",
    "an efficient mass - transfer mode was suggested for mira - type interacting binaries ( i.e. being in the effect for d - type sss ) by mohamed & podsiadlowski ( @xcite ) . in this case , a slow and dense wind from an evolved agb star is filling the roche lobe ( @xmath24 ) instead the star itself , and thus can be transferred very effectively into the potential of the companion via the @xmath25 point .",
    "this mass transfer mode is called _ wind roche - lobe overflow _ ( wrlof ) .    in the case of s - type sss ,",
    "whose donors are normal rgs , an effective wind mass transfer can be caused by their rotation .",
    "recently , skopal & carikov ( @xcite ) applied the wind compression disk model ( wcd ) of bjorkman & cassinelli ( @xcite ) to slowly rotating giants in s - type sss , and found that their wind can be focused at the equatorial plane with a factor of 510 relative to the spherically symmetric wind ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this suggests a relevant increase of the accretion rate onto the wd .",
    "investigating the hydrogen column densities , we obtained from the spectra of eclipsing s - type sss , suggests that the wind from their rgs is really enhanced at the orbital plane ( see shagatova & skopal , this proceedings ) .",
    "mass - loss rates from rgs in sss are in the order of @xmath26 and @xmath27@xmath4  for s - type and d - type systems .",
