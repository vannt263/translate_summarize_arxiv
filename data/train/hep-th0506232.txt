    "d3 branes living at conical calabi - yau singularities are a good laboratory for the ads / cft correspondence since its early days .",
    "the world - volume theory on the branes is dual to a type iib background of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the horizon manifold @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry requires that @xmath2 is a sasaki - einstein manifold . until few months ago , the only known sasaki - einstein metrics were the round sphere @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the horizon of the conifold .",
    "recently , various infinite classes of new regular sasaki - einstein metrics were constructed @xcite and named @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for infinite values of the integers @xmath7 one obtains smooth sasaki - einstein manifolds . with the determination of the corresponding dual gauge theory ( see @xcite for the @xmath5 manifolds and @xcite for the @xmath6 ) ,",
    "new checks of the ads / cft correspondence were possible @xcite .",
    "as well known , the central charge of the cft and the dimension of some operators can be compared with the volumes of @xmath2 and of some of its submanifolds . in particular",
    ", the a - maximization technique @xcite now allows for a detailed computation of the relevant quantum field theory quantities .",
    "needless to say , the agreement of the two computations is perfect .    the number of explicit metrics for sasaki - einstein horizons than can be used in the ads / cft correspondence is rapidly increasing .",
    "however , to demystify a little bit the importance of having an explicit metric , we should note that all relevant volumes are computed for calibrated divisors .",
    "this means that these volumes can be computed without actually knowing the metric .",
    "there exist moreover a beautiful geometrical counterpart of the a - maximization @xcite : this is the volume minimization proposed in @xcite for determining the reeb vector for toric cones .",
    "this procedure only relies on the vectors defining the toric fan .",
    "this suggests that with a correspondence between toric diagrams and gauge theories , many checks of the ads / cft correspondence can be done without an explicit knowledge of the metric .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper , indeed , to show that the knowledge of the toric data is sufficient to determine many properties of the dual gauge theory and to perform all the mentioned checks , for every singularity .",
    "the precise correspondence between conical calabi - yau singularities and superconformal gauge theories is still unknown .",
    "however , a remarkable progress has been recently made for the class of gorenstein toric singularities .",
    "the brane tiling ( dimers ) construction @xcite , an ingenious generalization of the brane boxes @xcite , introduces a direct relation between an hanany - witten realization @xcite for gauge theory and the toric diagram .",
    "in particular , from the quiver associated with a non - chiral superconformal gauge theory one can determine the dual brane tiling configuration , a dimer lattice .",
    "it is then possible to associate a toric diagram with each of these lattices , identifying the dual calabi - yau .",
    "the inverse process ( to associate a gauge theory with a given singularity ) is more difficult .",
    "however , for the mentioned checks of the ads / cft correspondence , we do nt really need the full quiver description of the gauge theory .",
    "we just need to know the r - charges and the multiplicities of chiral fields . in this paper , elaborating on existing results in the literature @xcite , we propose a general assignment of charges and multiplicities for the gauge theory dual to a generic gorenstein singularity .",
    "this assignment is made using only the toric data of the singularity .",
    "we then compare the result of a - maximization with that of volume minimization showing that the two procedures are completely equivalent .",
    "this agreement is remarkable .",
    "we have two different algebraic procedures for computing the r - symmetry charges of the fields and the volumes .",
    "the first is based on the maximization of the central charge @xcite .",
    "the second one can be efficiently encoded in a geometrical minimization procedure for determining the reeb vector @xcite .",
    "the two procedures deal with different test quantities ( the r - charges on one side and the components of the reeb vector on the other ) and with different functions to be extremized .",
    "however , we will show that , with a suitable parametrization , the two functions ( @xmath8 and the inverse volume ) are equal , even before extremization .",
    "the agreement of results in the gauge theory and the supergravity side can be regarded as a general non - trivial check of the ads / cft correspondence , valid for all the theories living on branes at toric singularities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ gauge ]",
    "we briefly review the general features of the gauge theories dual to conical singularities . in section [ geometry ]",
    "we propose the assignment of r - charges and multiplicities for the gauge theory in terms of geometrical data . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we show the equivalence of the a - maximization and the volume minimization .",
    "section [ examples ] contains several examples based on known gauge theories and various observations .",
    "in particular , as a by product of our analysis , we discuss in detail the case of the manifolds @xmath9 introduced in @xcite whose general analysis was missing in the literature .",
    "we also make some observations on the identification of fields using the brane tiling technology .",
    "finally , the appendix contains the proofs of various results that are too long and boring for the main text .",
    "we consider @xmath10 d3-branes living at a conical gorenstein singularity .",
    "the internal manifold is a six - dimensional symplectic toric cone ; its base , or horizon , is a five - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as well known , the @xmath11 gauge theory living on the branes is superconformal and dual in the ads / cft correspondence to the type iib background @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge theory on the world - volume of the d3 branes is not chiral and represents a toric phase @xcite , where all gauge groups have the same number of colors @xmath10 and the only matter fields are bi - fundamentals .",
    "by applying a seiberg duality we can obtain a different theory that flows in the ir to the same cft . if we dualize a gauge group with number of flavors equal to @xmath12 we remain in a toric phase where all gauge groups have number of colors @xmath10 . in this process",
    "the number of gauge groups remains constant but the number of matter fields changes . in a toric phase the following relation between the number of gauge groups @xmath13",
    ", the number of chiral fields @xmath14 and the number of terms in the superpotential @xmath15 @xmath16 is valid @xcite .",
    "indeed for a gauge theory living on branes placed at the tip of toric cy cone , one can extend the quiver diagram , drawing it on a torus @xmath17 .",
    "the dual graph , known as the brane tiling associated with the gauge theory @xcite , has @xmath13 faces , @xmath14 edges and @xmath15 vertices and it is still defined on a torus .",
    "the previous formula then follows from the euler formula for a torus @xcite .    we can assign an r - charge to all the chiral fields",
    "the most general non - anomalous r - symmetry is determined by the cancellation of anomalies for each gauge group and by the requirement that each term in the superpotential has r - charge @xmath18 .",
    "this would seem to imply @xmath19 linear conditions for @xmath14 unknowns with an unique solution .",
    "however , in the cases we are interested in , not all the conditions are linearly independent .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the r - symmetry can mix with all the non anomalous @xmath20 global symmetries .",
    "we can count the number of global non - anomalous @xmath20 symmetries from the number of massless vectors in the @xmath21 dual . since the manifold is toric",
    ", the metric has three @xmath20 isometries .",
    "one of these ( the reeb one ) corresponds to the r - symmetry while the other two are related to non - anomalous global @xmath20s .",
    "other gauge fields in @xmath21 come from the reduction of the rr four form on the non - trivial three - spheres in the horizon manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the number of three - cycles depends on the topology of the horizon , and , as we will review soon , can be computed using the toric data of the singularity . in the supergravity literature",
    "the vector multiplets obtained from rr four form are known as the betti multiplets . on the gauge theory side , these gauge fields correspond to baryonic symmetries .    at the fixed point , only one of the possible non - anomalous r - symmetry enters in the superconformal algebra .",
    "it is the one in the same multiplet as the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the actual value of the r - charges at the fixed point can be found by using the a - maximization technique @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we have to maximize the a - charge @xcite @xmath22 it is not difficult to show that the absence of anomalies implies @xmath23 so that we can equivalently maximize @xmath24 .    the results of the maximization give a complete information about the values of the central charge and the dimensions of chiral operators at the conformal fixed point .",
    "these can be compared with the prediction of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . the first important point is that the central charge is related to the volume of the internal manifold @xcite @xmath25 moreover , recall that in the ads / cft correspondence a special role is played by baryons .",
    "the gravity dual describes a theory with @xmath26 gauge groups .",
    "the fact that the groups are @xmath26 and not @xmath27 allows the existence of dibaryons .",
    "each bi - fundamental field @xmath28 gives rise to a gauge invariant baryonic operator @xmath29 it is sometime convenient to think about the baryonic symmetries as non - anomalous combinations of @xmath20 factors in the enlarged @xmath30 theory . in the ads",
    "dual the baryonic symmetries correspond to the reduction of the rr four form and the dibaryons are described by a d3-brane wrapped on a non - trivial three cycle .",
    "the r - charge of the @xmath31-th field can be computed in terms of the volume of the corresponding cycle @xmath32 using the formula @xcite @xmath33",
    "in this section we propose a general formula for the r - charges and the multiplicity of chiral fields based only on the toric data .",
    "this proposal is the natural combination of existing results @xcite and it is substantially implicit in previous papers on the subject .",
    "it is based on a formula for multiplicities first derived using mirror symmetry @xcite . the same proposal appeared for the case of @xmath34 manifolds in @xcite , under the name of `` folded quiver '' .",
    "web for @xmath35 . ]        web for @xmath35 . ]    the fan associated with a six - dimensional symplectic toric cone is generated by @xmath36 integers primitive vectors in @xmath37 , which we call @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "when the cone is a calabi - yau manifold , we can perform an @xmath40 transformation to put the first coordinates of the @xmath38 s equal to 1 .",
    "the intersection of the fan with the plane of points having the first coordinate @xmath41 is thus a convex polygon @xmath35 , called toric diagram , and we shall call the vectors associated to its sides @xmath42 , @xmath39 , as in figure [ polygon ] . in figure [ pqweb ]",
    "we draw the corresponding @xmath43 web : the vectors @xmath42 have the same length than the edges of the polygon @xmath35 .",
    "both the sides of @xmath35 and the vectors of the @xmath43 web .",
    "in fact they differ only by a rotation of @xmath44 .",
    "when some of the sides of the polygon @xmath35 pass through integer points , that is for singular horizons , we should consider more complicated @xmath43 webs ; here we are ignoring such subtleties .",
    "we claim that this does not affect the process of a - maximization , since it is equivalent to setting to zero the charges @xmath45 associated with integers points on the sides of @xmath35 ( see subsection [ singhorizon ] ) .",
    "] let us also define the symbol : @xmath46 that is the determinant of the matrix with @xmath47 and @xmath48 as first and second line respectively , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two vectors in the plane of @xmath35 .",
    "this is the oriented area of the parallelogram generated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "some of the data of the gauge theory can be extracted directly from the geometry of the cone . in particular , there exist simple formulae for the number of gauge groups @xmath13 and the total number of chiral bi - fundamental fields @xmath14 @xcite @xmath49 notice that the expression for @xmath14 refers to a particular toric phase of the gauge theory .",
    "the number of toric phases of a theory can be large ; hopefully , the value of @xmath14 in formula  ( [ numbers ] ) refers to the phase with the minimal number of fields .",
    "the r - charges and the multiplicity of fields with given r - charge are more difficult to determine . here",
    "we make a proposal based on the following general observations .",
    "each chiral field is associated with a dibaryon and , consequently , with a supersymmetric three cycle in the horizon @xmath2 .",
    "the cone over this cycle is a divisor in the symplectic cone @xmath50 .",
    "each edge @xmath38 in the fan determines a divisor @xmath51 and the collection of the @xmath51 , subject to some relations , is a complete basis of divisors for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we can therefore associate a type of chiral field to each vector @xmath38 @xcite and assign it a trial r - charge @xmath52 .",
    "it is important to stress that more than one chiral field is associated with a single divisor : as pointed out in @xcite , a d3 brane wrapped on the cycle @xmath53 may have more than one supersymmetric vacuum and each of these corresponds to a different bi - fundamental but with the same r - charge . as shown in @xcite the volumes of the base three cycles @xmath32 of the divisors",
    "@xmath51 satisfy the relation @xmath54 which implies , using formula  ( [ baryons ] ) , @xmath55 . in general",
    ", these @xmath36 fields will not exhaust all the different types of chiral fields .",
    "we expect the existence of other dibaryons obtained from divisors which are linear combinations of the @xmath51s .",
    "the r - charges of the corresponding fields will not be independent but they will be determined as a linear combination of the @xmath52s .",
    "indeed , we claim that the @xmath52s parametrize the most general r - symmetry .. ] the number of independent parameters in the trial r charge is equal to the number of global @xmath20 symmetries .",
    "we always have two global symmetries from the toric action and a number of baryonic symmetries equal to the number of three cycles .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the latter is equal to @xmath56 ; each baryonic symmetry @xmath57 is indeed associated with a linear relation among the edges @xmath38 @xmath58 and there are exactly @xmath56 such relations . in conclusion , we have a total number of @xmath59 global @xmath20 symmetries which matches the number of independent parameters @xmath52 .",
    "collecting all these pieces of information , we can propose the following assignments of r - charges and multiplicities for the chiral fields in the gauge theory :    * associate with each edge vector @xmath38 a chiral field with trial r - charge @xmath52 , with the constraint , @xmath60 * call @xmath61 the set of all the unordered pairs of vectors in the @xmath43 web ; we label an element of @xmath61 with the ordered indexes @xmath62 , with the convention that the vector @xmath42 can be rotated to @xmath63 in the counter - clockwise direction with an angle @xmath64 . with our conventions @xmath65 .",
    "associate with any element of @xmath61 the divisor @xmath66 and a type of chiral field in the field theory with multiplicity @xmath67 and r - charge equal to @xmath68 .",
    "the indexes @xmath31 , @xmath69 are always understood to be defined modulo @xmath36 .",
    "for example in figure [ pqweb ] the field associated to the pair @xmath70 has r - charge @xmath71 and multiplicity @xmath72 .",
    "the total number of fields is the sum of all the multiplicities : @xmath73 and thus reproduces formula  ( [ numbers ] ) .",
    "more generally , we can assign global symmetry charges to all the fields .",
    "the algorithm is very similar to that for r - charges :    *   assign global charges @xmath52 to the fields corresponding to vertices @xmath38 .",
    "the only difference is that now @xmath52 satisfy the relation : @xmath74 *   the global charges of composite chiral fields are then : @xmath75 for the fields corresponding to @xmath62 in @xmath61 .    with a small abuse of notation",
    ", we will use the same letter @xmath52 for r and global symmetries ; in the first case they satisfy @xmath55 , while in the latter @xmath76 .",
    "note that with the assignment ( [ sommazero ] ) we parametrize all the possible @xmath59 global symmetries , the @xmath56 baryonic ones and the two flavor ones .",
    "we can explicitly identify the baryonic symmetries as follows . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the chiral fields associated with the edges @xmath38 have a charge under the baryonic symmetry @xmath57 equal to the coefficient @xmath77 in the linear relations  ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "notice that the baryonic charges of the fields associated with the edges @xmath38 sum up to zero @xmath78 and therefore satisfy eq .",
    "( [ sommazero ] ) as a consequence of the calabi - yau condition ; the latter requires that all the vectors @xmath38 lie on a plane which , in our conventions , means that the first coordinate of all @xmath38 is @xmath79 . in conclusion , among the global symmetries , those satisfying also the constraint ( [ linear ] )",
    "( with @xmath80 ) are the baryonic ones , the remaining two ( for which there is not a natural basis , being mixed with baryonic symmetries @xcite ) are the flavor ones .",
    "we conjecture that for every gorenstein toric singularity there exists a toric phase of the dual gauge theory where the r - charges and the multiplicities of all chiral fields can be computed with the algorithm above .",
    "this toric phase has generally the minimal number of chiral fields ( [ numbers ] ) , as we have checked in many known cases . to be concrete look at figure [ lpqr ] corresponding to @xmath81 .",
    "there are six kinds of fields : the four with charge @xmath52 , fields with charge @xmath82 and others with charge @xmath83 , but there are not for instance fields with charge @xmath84 , since the region formed by @xmath85 and @xmath86 which includes @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the @xmath43 web has always an angle greater than @xmath89 .",
    "note that in general the number of different kinds of fields is @xmath90 , the number of elements of @xmath61 .",
    "note also that the r - charges of composite chiral fields can be written as sum of consecutive @xmath52s ; since @xmath35 is convex the ordering of vectors @xmath42 in the @xmath43 web is always equal to the ordering of @xmath42 in @xmath35 .",
    "with this assignment , we have a trial central charge @xmath8 given by : @xmath91 recall that @xmath13 is the double area of the polygon @xmath35 ( [ numbers ] ) .",
    "the values of the r - charges @xmath52 can be found by ( locally ) maximizing this formula .",
    "note that this formula and the algorithm proposed above are obviously invariant under translations and @xmath92 transformations in the plane of @xmath35 , since @xmath67 are conserved , also in sign .",
    "all the signs are reversed and so relative orientations do not change . ]",
    "we can make several checks of this proposal .",
    "first of all , it is easy to compare the proposal to the case where the quiver gauge theory is explicitly known .",
    "several examples are discussed in section [ examples ] . in some cases , the fields and their multiplicity can be determined by using mirror symmetry ; this was done for the toric delpezzo in @xcite where the formula for the multiplicities based on the @xmath43 web first appeared .",
    "the multiplicity of the fields associated with the edges @xmath38 was computed in @xcite and agrees with our proposal : @xmath93 since the fields corresponding to the pair @xmath94 in @xmath61 have r - charge @xmath52 ; we have used that the first coordinates of @xmath38 are equal to 1 .",
    "a proposal identical to ours was used in @xcite to determine the gauge theory for the @xmath6 manifolds .",
    "we can next study the consistency of our proposal with the general properties of the @xmath20 symmetries in our theories .",
    "first of all , we must have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a general r - charge or global symmetry charge .",
    "in particular @xmath97 .",
    "the proof of this formula is relatively easy and is reported in the appendix .",
    "another non trivial check of our proposal is the proof , reported in the appendix , that , for baryonic symmetries , @xmath98 this condition , which is true also for mixed baryonic symmetries , is a consequence of the vanishing of the cubic thooft anomaly for a baryonic symmetry .",
    "this follows from the fact that on the stack of d3 branes in type iib the baryonic symmetries are actually gauged .",
    "the counterpart of this statement in the ads dual is that cubic anomalies are computed from the chern - simons terms in the five dimensional supergravity and no such term can contain three vector fields coming from reduction of the rr four - form @xcite .",
    "the best check of the proposal is however the computation of the r - charges at the fixed point using a - maximization and the comparison with volumes of three cycles in @xmath2 . now that we have an algorithm to extract the field content of the gauge theory from the toric diagram , it is not difficult to write down an algorithm on a computer and check the agreement of a - maximization with z - minimization on arbitrary large polytopes .",
    "the complete agreement of the a - maximization with the volume minimization of @xcite will be discussed in details in the next section , where a general analytic proof will be given .",
    "we finish this section by making some remarks about other toric phases of the same cft with more chiral fields than the minimal phase presented above . in practical examples",
    "we often meet toric phases with the same trial central charge @xmath8 than the minimal phase ; these phases generally contain all the kinds of fields of the minimal phase , but with greater multiplicities .",
    "in fact there are other possible assignments of r - charges and multiplicities leading to the same @xmath8 charge .",
    "for example , to each element in @xmath61 we may assign two different types of chiral fields , one associated with the divisor @xmath99 with r - charge @xmath100 , and a second one associated with the divisor are always defined modulo @xmath36 . ] @xmath101 with r - charge @xmath102 .",
    "if we assign multiplicities @xmath103 and @xmath104 to the two types of fields with the constraint @xmath105 it is easy to see that the equations @xmath106 are still satisfied",
    ". moreover the expression for the trial central charge @xmath8 is unchanged . indeed",
    "the contribution of the integers @xmath103 to the central charge cancels : @xmath107 the formula  ( [ numbers ] ) for the number of chiral fields is obviously no more satisfied . each time a field is split and a new arbitrary integer @xmath103 is introduced , the total numbers of fields increase .",
    "formula  ( [ numbers ] ) is strictly valid for the minimal presentation .",
    "we do not expect that for all arbitrary choices of @xmath103 and pairs @xmath62 there exists a non minimal toric phase with multiplicities of chiral fields described by this splitting mechanism , even though many known toric phases are characterized by multiplicities determined in this simple way .",
    "in fact all the examples of ( non minimal ) toric phases considered in this paper are described by this splitting mechanism , and it would be interesting to know whether this is true in general .",
    "for the purposes of the ads / cft correspondence , the r - charges of the chiral fields have to be matched with the volumes of the three - cycles bases @xmath32 of the corresponding divisors . in the previous section we proposed a formula for computing the r - charges and the trial",
    "central charge @xmath8 directly from the toric diagram .",
    "moreover in @xcite it was shown that all the geometric information on the volumes can be extracted from the toric data , through the process known as volume minimization ( or z - minimization ) , without any explicit knowledge of the metric .",
    "the reason for that is the following : supersymmetric cycles are calibrated and the volumes can be extracted only from the kahler form on the cone . therefore now it is possible to compare directly r - charges in the gauge theory and volumes in the geometry , checking the correctness of the ads / cft predictions for every toric cy cone . in this section",
    "we discuss the equivalence of a - maximization and z - minimization .",
    "we start by reviewing the work of @xcite and reducing their formulas in the plane containing the convex polygon @xmath35 .",
    "the reeb vector @xmath108 of a symplectic toric cone can be expanded in a basis @xmath109 for the @xmath110 effective action on the fiber : @xmath111 where the vector of coordinates @xmath112 lives inside the toric fan of the cone .",
    "the reeb vector is associated with an r - symmetry in the dual gauge theory ; by varying the vector we change the r - symmetry by mixing it with the global symmetries . from the geometrical point of view",
    ", the variation of the reeb vector changes the metric and the volumes . for only one choice of vector @xmath113",
    "there exists a calabi - yau metric for the cone .",
    "the vector @xmath113 has @xmath114 and can be determined through the minimization of a certain function z of the variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we rephrase this process in the plane containing @xmath35 by writing @xmath117 and allowing the point @xmath118 to vary inside the convex polygon @xmath35 : note in fact that @xmath119 is inside the fan .",
    "define the functions : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the plane vector going from @xmath122 to the vertex @xmath123 ( see figure [ reeb ] ) .",
    "inside the polygon @xmath35 . ]    as shown in @xcite , these are the volumes of the base three - cycles associated with the divisors @xmath124 .",
    "define also the function : @xmath125 which determines the total volume of the horizon @xmath2 .",
    "the two previous equations are just equations ( 3.25 ) and ( 3.26 ) of @xcite .",
    "the function to minimize is just @xmath126 in @xcite up to a constant multiplicative factor . ] and the position of the minimum @xmath127 gives the reeb vector @xmath128 for the cy cone .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that such minimum exists and is unique .",
    "the values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 at the minimum are the total volume of @xmath2 and the volumes of @xmath32 to be compared with the central charge @xmath8 and the r - charges @xmath52 of the field theory through the ads / cft relations ( [ central ] ) and ( [ baryons ] ) . to facilitate this comparison",
    "we define the geometrical function : @xmath131 and the functions : @xmath132 corresponding to the r - charges @xmath133 through equation ( [ baryons ] ) .",
    "the process of z - minimization can be restated as a maximization of @xmath134 with @xmath135 varying in the interior of @xmath35 .    on the other side of the correspondence",

    "this function has to be locally maximized with the constraint ( [ sommadue ] ) ( and @xmath138 ) . to impose this constraint",
    "it is enough to introduce a lagrange multiplier @xmath139 and to extremize the function : @xmath140 by deriving with respect to @xmath52 we get the conditions : in the local maximum is parallel to the vector @xmath141 .",

    "first of all a - maximization is done on a total of @xmath59 independent trial parameters while the volume minimization is done only on two parameters @xmath135 .",
    "the trial central charge @xmath8 is a cubic polynomial in @xmath52 , whereas @xmath147 is a rational function of @xmath135 .",
    "these parameters , in both cases , are somehow related to the possible global symmetries : the reeb vector in the geometry is connected to r - symmetries of the gauge theory and changing the position of @xmath122 in the directions @xmath148 and @xmath149 means adding to the r - symmetry the two flavor global symmetries . in any case , the volume minimization is done by moving only in a two dimensional subspace of the set of global symmetries , while a - maximization is done on the entire space .",
    "fortunately , as often claimed in the literature , a - maximization can be always performed on a two dimensional space of parameters related to flavor symmetries . indeed , on general grounds , one can parametrize the trial r - symmetry as a contribution @xmath150 from the flavor symmetries plus a baryonic part @xmath151 and the elimination of the variables @xmath152 is simple : imposing that the derivatives of @xmath153 with respect to @xmath152 vanish , one gets the equations @xmath154 these conditions read @xmath155 which is a linear system of @xmath56 equations in the @xmath56 variables @xmath152 .",
    "linearity in @xmath152 follows from the fact that the cubic mixed thooft anomaly for baryonic symmetries is zero : @xmath156 .",
    "so one can solve for @xmath152 in function of @xmath157 , @xmath158 and substitute into the trial charge ( [ rflavor ] ) ; the central charge @xmath8 is now a rational function only of @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "so we have reduced a - maximization to a maximization over a set of two parameters .    in the previous argument",
    ", the choice of a basis of flavor and baryonic symmetries in ( [ rflavor ] ) was quite arbitrary . in our specific case",
    "we can choose a more natural parameterization for the two dimensional space over which to reduce a - maximization .",

    "in fact it is not difficult to prove that the gradient of the trial central charge along the @xmath56 baryonic directions evaluated on @xmath162 is always zero : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a baryon charge and where the equality holds for every @xmath135 in the interior of @xmath35 .",
    "we give the general proof of ( [ derbaryon ] ) in the appendix .",
    "note that equation ( [ derbaryon ] ) is completely equivalent to the condition ( [ ba ] ) when the trial r - charge is evaluated with @xmath165 .",
    "therefore we have clarified in which sense the baryonic symmetries decouple from the process of a - maximization .    at this point",
    "we have to compare the two functions @xmath134 and the field theory trial central charge evaluated on the surface @xmath162 , which are two functions only of @xmath135 .",
    "remarkably one discovers that they are equal even before maximization : @xmath166 for every @xmath135 inside the interior of @xmath35 .",
    "we give a general ( still long ) analytic proof of ( [ equal ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the proof of the equivalence of a - maximization and z - minimization is now almost finished : we know that @xmath134 has a unique maximum @xmath167 inside the polygon @xmath35 .",
    "in this point we have for the field theory @xmath8 : @xmath168 where @xmath169 , @xmath170 is @xmath148 or @xmath149 .",
    "so we see that , in the point @xmath127 , also the two vectors : @xmath171 belonging to the space of global symmetries ( since @xmath172 ) are orthogonal to the gradient of @xmath173 . together with the @xmath56 baryon symmetries they span the whole @xmath59 space of global symmetries , thus proving ( [ global ] ) in the point @xmath167 .",
    "therefore the extremum point for the trial central charge lies on the surface @xmath162 .",

    "we will concentrate on theories for which the multiplicities of the auxiliary fields in the associated witten sigma model corresponding to vertices of the toric diagram are all equal to one .",

    "moreover these configurations survive the test of the equivalence between a - maximization and z - minimization .",

    "note that , up to auxiliary fields multiplicities , we get the same toric configuration if we choose : @xmath213 but with n odd there is a vertex of the toric diagram ( precisely @xmath214 ) having more than one corresponding perfect matching , as one can see again from the kasteleyn matrix .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that the theories corresponding to configurations @xmath215 with @xmath10 odd do not match the z - minimization results of the corresponding toric diagrams .",

    "the trial r - charges associated with some fields ( those corresponding to the cuts of the hexagons ) are zero and this violates the unitary bound since the corresponding gauge invariant dibaryon operators would have dimension zero . in this way , we have built an infinite family of quiver gauge theories , that can be represented with dimer configurations , but can not have any geometric ads / cft dual .",
    "we analyzed some other cases of theories without a geometric dual by varying also @xmath216 , and always found that such theories have at least a vertex of the toric diagram with number of perfect matchings associated greater than one .",
    "we conjecture that the request of having only a perfect matching corresponding to each vertex of the toric diagram is necessary for the existence of an ads / cft dual , but this statement should be further studied . in the following we only consider theories that satisfy such request .",
    "our conjecture is that it is possible to assign r charges ( or global charges ) once the perfect matchings corresponding to the vertices of the toric diagram are known .. ] the method is simple : assign r - charge ( or global charge ) @xmath52 to the perfect matching corresponding to the vertex @xmath38 of the toric diagram . the charges @xmath52 satisfy ( [ sommadue ] ) if they are r - charges or ( [ sommazero ] ) if they are global charges .",
    "the ( r-)charge of a link in the dimer configuration is then the sum of all ( r-)charges of the perfect matchings ( corresponding to vertices of the toric diagram ) to which the link belongs .",
    "we have checked in many known cases that this method works , also in different toric phases of the same theory . for phases with the minimal number of fields",
    "it reproduces our formula for the multiplicities of the different kinds of fields . for example",
    "it is not difficult to extract the perfect matchings associated to vertices of the @xmath9 theories from the kasteleyn matrix reported in the previous subsection .",
    "and then one can check that the distribution of r - charges in the dimer obtained with the method proposed is a good distribution , that is one verifies that at every vertex the sum of r - charges is 2 ( invariance of the superpotential ) and for every face the sum of r - charges is equal to the number of edges minus 2 ( beta functions equal to zero ) .",
    "we give other explicit examples of this method in the following subsection .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether this method works in general .",
    "obviously the invariance of the superpotential is guaranteed , since every perfect matching takes every vertex once and the sum of the @xmath52 is 2 .",
    "it would be necessary also to prove the condition for faces ( zero beta functions ) . in the toric phases with minimal number of fields the method for computing multiplicities of fields described in section [ geometry ] should hold .",
    "every perfect matching is made up with @xmath217 links , where @xmath15 , the number of vertices in the dimer configuration , is computed in minimal phases from the toric diagram as @xmath218 .",
    "the method proposed in this subsection implies that there are exactly @xmath217 fields containing the charge @xmath87 , and the same is true for every @xmath52 , @xmath219 .",
    "consistence with our formulas for computing multiplicities from the @xmath43 web requires that the sum of multiplicities of all fields containing @xmath52 is equal to @xmath217 independently from @xmath31 .",
    "this is true and is proved in appendix [ useful ] .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us remind that in @xcite it was discovered that a chiral field ( a link in the dimer ) in the gauge theory can be written as the product of all auxiliary fields associated to perfect matchings to which the field belongs , and not only to perfect matchings corresponding to vertices of the toric diagram .",
    "hence we have claimed that only the perfect matchings associated to vertices are charged under r or global symmetries , whereas other perfect matchings have charges equal to zero .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the example of the theories associated with the complex cone over @xmath220 .",
    "this toric manifold is interesting since its toric diagram has six edges and four different toric phases are known .",
    "all the corresponding quivers are given in @xcite .",
    "we draw in figures [ toricdp3 ] and [ pqwebdp3 ] the toric diagram and @xmath43 web for @xmath220 ; we also show the assignment of charges @xmath52 in our conventions .",

    "this model has the least number of fields among the toric phases of @xmath220 , in agreement with equations ( [ numbers ] ) .",
    "we draw the dimer configuration for model i in figure [ dp3m1 ] ; we label the chiral fields @xmath224 with numbers @xmath225 typed in blue and vertices with letters @xmath226 .",
    "the identification of faces is as in @xcite .    , model i. ]    to compute the r - charges of the theory we can use the method suggested in the previous subsection ; first we have to know the perfect matchings associated to the vertices . a fast way to compute them is by writing the determinant of a modified kasteleyn matrix : @xmath227 where we have written for every field not only the usual weight in function of @xmath200 and @xmath228 @xcite , but also the name of the field itself . note that it is not necessary to be careful about signs .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath229 in the expression of @xmath230 gives the perfect matching(s ) associated with the point at position @xmath62 in the plane of the toric diagram .",
    "so we find that the perfect matchings associated with the vertices are : @xmath231 where on the left we have written the r - charge associated with the vertex / perfect matching .",
    "we can then compute the r - charges of the fields @xmath224 as described in the previous subsection by summing all the charges of the vertex perfect matchings to which a field @xmath224 belongs .",
    "we thus get the following table for r - charges : @xmath232 we have found five independent trial r - charges ( there is relation ( [ sommadue ] ) among the @xmath52 ) , and indeed it is not difficult to show that they are the correct ones , for example by writing the matrix @xmath233 as in appendix a.2 of @xcite .",
    "note that the multiplicities ( equal to 1 for @xmath220 ) and the kinds of different fields just found are in agreement with the general formula we propose in this paper .",
    "so we recognize in model i the minimal toric phase of @xmath220 for which the formulae proposed in this paper strictly hold .",
    "there are three other phases of @xmath220 with more than 12 fields .",

    "the only way to get a theory with 8 gauge groups is by eliminating ( any ) one of the links in the dimer of @xmath252 . integrating out the massive fields one gets model ii , figure [ notsmooth2 ] , which has @xmath254 , @xmath255 . performing a seiberg duality with respect to the gauge group corresponding to face e in the dimer of figure [ notsmooth2 ] , one gets model i for this theory , which has fewer fields : @xmath256 , @xmath242 .",
