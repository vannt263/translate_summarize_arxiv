    "nuclear fission has been the focus of intense experimental and theoretical studies ever since its discovery almost 80 years ago @xcite .",
    "usually , fission results in two fragments ( binary fission ) with similar ( symmetric fission ) or dissimilar ( asymmetric fission ) masses .",
    "the possibility of fission into three fragments ( ternary fission , see @xcite for a review ) , was proposed @xcite shortly after the discovery of binary fission .",
    "experimental evidence of ternary fission was found 70 years ago in nuclear emulsion photographs @xcite and in measurements with ionization chambers @xcite .",
    "detailed investigations showed that ternary fission occurs once every few hundred fission events . in @xmath4 of all ternary fission events , the third particle , called the ternary particle , is a @xmath5 nuclei , and in @xmath6 hydrogen or a heavier helium nuclei . in only @xmath7 of all ternary fission events",
    "does the ternary particle have @xmath8 , with yields rapidly dropping with increased @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "ternary particles up to @xmath10 have been observed at yields of the order of @xmath11 per fission @xcite .",
    "however , early claims @xcite for yet heavier ternary particles or even `` true ternary fission '' with three fragments of comparable masses remain disputed . dedicated counting experiments searching for such events in planar geometry @xcite and radiochemical experiments @xcite gave upper yield limits below @xmath12 for true ternary fission .    therefore , it came as a great surprise when the fobos collaboration reported new experiments indicating true ternary fission events with a yield of @xmath13 per fission @xcite .",
    "these experiments were performed with the fission fragment spectrometers fobos and mini - fobos @xcite , in which detector modules are placed at opposite sides ( @xmath14 angle ) of a thin fission target .",
    "the fission target backing creates an intrinsic asymmetry of the setup since fragments detected in one of the arms have to traverse the backing .",
    "binary coincidences from @xmath15 and @xmath16 were measured with this setup .",
    "the binary spectrum showed an enhancement of events with lower energy from the detector arm on the side of the target backing .",
    "some of these missing energy events were interpreted as missing mass , that could correspond to a third particle missing detection due to scattering in the fission target backing .",
    "the claim was that three heavy fragments were emitted perfectly collinearly along the fission axis , the two lightest fragments in the same direction as the target backing , and the heavy in the opposite , and that the smallest of the three fragments ( the ternary particle ) did not reach the active area of the detector .",
    "hence , this interpretation was dubbed `` collinear cluster tri - partition '' ( cct ) . in the following",
    ", we will use this definition of cct as collinear fission events with a relative angle between fragment emission directions of @xmath17 @xcite .    a similar experiment , but without an explicit asymmetry in any of the flight paths ,",
    "was performed by @xcite , showing no indication of neither cct nor missing mass events , down to a level of @xmath18 per fission in @xmath15 .",
    "given these surprising results and the high reported yield of @xmath1 , the fact that no indication of cct was found before in neither radiochemical analysis , nor coincidence measurements , calls for an independent verification , preferably with a direct observation method .",
    "this is indeed possible , and under way , with the lohengrin fission fragment recoil separator ( to be reported in a future paper ) . for a verification experiment based on direct observation ,",
    "it is crucial to know which kinetic energies to scan .",
    "since the fobos collaboration did not report at which kinetic energies the fragments were measured , these kinetic energies need to be inferred from theory , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the kinetic energy distribution of one fragment in a ternary decay can not be derived from first principles . instead , the full range of kinetic energies allowed by energy and momentum conservation can be calculated , which is done in this study .",
    "this is straightforward since cct is a one - dimensional decay in which the acceleration is repulsion dominated , yielding a limited amount of possibilities of how the kinetic energy can be distributed between the fragments .",
    "the possible kinetic energies are reduced even further by the constraint posed by the fobos experiments , that two of the fragments have a kinetic energy which is high enough to enter the detector arms and leave a clear signal .",
    "an experiment that can cover all the energies allowed by energy and momentum conservation can thus verify cct model - independently .",
    "if events are found , our model calculations would indicate how the breakups proceed in cct , by comparison with the measured kinetic energies .",
    "we start this paper by detailing which fissioning systems will be studied .",
    "this is followed by a description of the theoretical models spanning the possible kinetic energies in cct , and the monte - carlo method used to study the intrinsic stability of collinearity .",
    "results are then presented in the form of possible final kinetic energies in cct , benchmarks of the methods used , studies that highlight overlooked contradictions in the models currently favored in the literature , and studies of the stability of cct .",
    "this is followed by discussions on verification of cct by direct observation , on the cct interpretation and on the intrinsic stability of cct .",
    "finally , the paper ends with conclusions and appendices with details of each model and method .",
    "in this paper , we present new and detailed calculations on the reported cct clusters @xcite @xmath19 both with and without intermediate steps leading up to the final fragments , where @xmath20 is the neutron multiplicity .",
    "other speculated fragments have similar masses and q - values , and therefore similar kinematics .",
    "the derivations presented in this paper allow easy extension to any desired system .    in the analysis of the fobos experiments @xcite ,",
    "the measurements were interpreted as masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 , with missing masses @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "these are the most energetically favorable masses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_qtot ] .",

    "( [ eq : intro:235u_decay ] ) and ( [ eq : intro:252cf_decay ] ) , respectively , at zero neutron multiplicity ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the q - values are calculated from mass excesses taken from ame2012 @xcite .",
    "no data are available for the bottom left corner ( i.e. for masses @xmath27 ) .",
    "prompt neutron emission @xmath28 generally lowers the q - values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_q_first ] ) . ]",
    "our study includes a slightly wider range of masses .",
    "the figure shows q - values which are relatively high compared to binary fission . as our results will show , however , a high q - value does not necessarily imply a high yield or probability for fission , since the intermediate steps may be unfavorable or forbidden .",
    "cct is a decay in one spatial dimension , in which three fragments are formed from one fissioning system ( fs ) through two breakups @xcite and accelerated along the same line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sequential_decay ] ) .",
    "if the time between breakups is long enough , there exists an intermediate state with a heavy fragment ( hf ) and an intermediate fragment ( if ) , the latter which splits in turn into a light fragment ( lf ) and a ternary particle ( tp ) .",
    "the ternary particle here refers to the lightest fragment .",
    "if the time between breakups is sufficiently short , there is no intermediate state , and the decay is a `` true '' three - body decay .",
    "( color online ) schematic picture of the formation of cct . for long timescales between two successive ( sequential ) breakups",
    ", there is an intermediate state ( 2 ) . for sufficiently short timescales between breakups ,",
    "there is no intermediate state , and the decay is a true three - body decay .",
    "arrows indicate momentum direction .",
    "see text for explanation of acronyms . ]    therefore , for a given fissioning system , the essential parameter to describe cct is the time between the two breakups . in this paper , we divide the timescale of this parameter into three regimes , or models , and explicitly show that the kinetic energies of these models overlap in the limits .",
    "the first model is called the `` sequential '' decay model @xcite and is based on two sequential binary fissions , with long timescales between the two successive scissions ( i.e. assuming fully accelerated fragments before the second scission ) .",
    "the second model is the recently proposed `` almost sequential '' decay model @xcite , with intermediate timescales between scissions ( assuming partially accelerated fragments before the second scission ) .",
    "these sequential models are the currently favored models in the literature . as is shown in the results",
    ", however , both of these models assume the fission of an intermediate system with a high fission barrier and extremely low ( or even negative ) q - value .",
    "this motivates the study of a third model which is based on traditional ternary fission models , and called in the following the `` true ternary '' decay model , with `` infinitesimal '' timescales between scissions ( i.e. no intermediate step or fragment ) .",
    "we mainly focus on the sequential and true ternary decay models , as they represent the extremes of the kinetic energy range , but we also show how to calculate all the possible kinetic energies allowed by energy and momentum conservation for all three models , for other fissioning systems as well .    the final kinetic energies of the fission fragments are obtained analytically in the sequential decay model .",
    "this is possible since the kinematics in this model is fully determined by energy and momentum conservation . in the almost sequential and true ternary decay models , the final kinetic energies depend on the dynamics .",
    "thus , these results are obtained with semi - classical trajectory calculations ( see @xcite chapter 12-iii for a review ) . in these calculations , the scission configuration ( initial fragment positions and momenta ) is constrained by energy and momentum conservation for a given fissioning system .",
    "subsequently , the final kinetic energies are calculated by starting from the scission configuration and solving the equations of motion iteratively .",
    "the latter is done with a fourth - order runge - kutta method using a time step of @xmath29  s , until more than @xmath30 of the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy .    since the 1960s",
    ", semi - classical trajectory calculations have been applied to ternary fission , mainly with the aim to determine the scission configuration @xcite . as in many of these studies ,",
    "a `` point charge approximation '' is used in our trajectory calculations , which assumes only a repulsive coulomb force between spherical fragments . for the purpose of",
    "finding which scission configuration matches a particular final distribution , this method has received critique due to ambiguity @xcite , since several initial configurations can have the same final distribution .",
    "we do not have the same aim , however .",
    "instead , we vary all possible initial collinear configurations in order to find all possible final kinetic energies of cct fragments .",
    "furthermore , we again stress the fact that in contrast to the previously mentioned studies , we study cct which is a one - dimensional problem in which the dynamics during the fission fragment acceleration is dominated by the repulsive coulomb interaction . adding an attractive nuclear correction to the sequential model does not affect the final momenta , since the latter is uniquely determined by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "this is verified by the perfect agreement between our results and that of @xcite , who included an attractive nuclear correction .",
    "still , we show explicitly that the attractive nuclear correction has a negligible effect in both the sequential and the almost sequential decay models ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : almost_sequential_decay_results ] ) . in the true ternary decay model",
    ", the attractive nuclear interaction reduces the possible kinetic energy range ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : simultaneous_decay_kinematics ] ) .",
    "since we are looking for the widest possible kinetic energy range to cover experimentally , the attractive nuclear interaction is excluded in this model to get a safe upper limit .",
    "in addition to deriving the possible final kinetic energies , we use a monte - carlo method to sample perturbations in the trajectory calculations , testing the intrinsic stability of collinearity in ternary fission , yielding the final angular distributions versus the perturbations .",
    "previous studies using the point charge approximation with a monte - carlo approach successfully reproduced experimental ternary fission data @xcite . furthermore , for the purpose of calculating final kinetic energies and angular distributions , it has been shown that the simple point charge approximation gives similar results to more sophisticated models , which incorporate attractive nuclear forces , fragment deformations and other effects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to test the validity of our semi - classical trajectory calculations , we set up several benchmarks .",
    "as a quantitative verification against analytical calculations , the sequential and almost sequential models are compared for extremely long times between the two scissions , and the two techniques show excellent agreement ( see results in sec .",
    "[ sec : sequential_decay_results ] ) .",
    "additional tests for ternary fission with @xmath5 ( not reported here ) reproduced well the results of the previously mentioned studies .",
    "we also verified for certain configurations that the inclusion of higher order moments corresponding to deformed fragments does not considerably affect the final momenta along the fission axis .      in the sequential decay model @xcite , the fissioning system splits into a heavy fragment and an intermediate fragment .",
    "the latter splits in turn into a light fragment and a ternary particle .",
    "the ternary particle here refers to the lightest fragment . either the tp or the lf can be formed at the center , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequential_decay ] .",

    "note , however , that in the decay of both mo and cd , the q - value is extremely low , for many mass splits even negative , and that any neutron multiplicity @xmath45 lowers the q - value further . to have any chance of decaying , the if needs excitation energy ( from here on denoted @xmath46 ) .",

    "all three models show that the kinetic energy of the ternary particle would be close to zero mev . at such low kinetic energies ,",
    "the ternary particle would barely be able to leave the target , traverse detector windows and dead layers to deposit enough energy for a clear signal .",
    "hence , it would be very easy to discriminate the ternary particle from the light fragment in a correctly designed experiment , due to the highly differing energies and velocities .",
    "both a symmetric and an asymmetric double - armed detector setup would therefore show a clear missing - mass signature in _ both _ detectors in a mass - versus - mass spectrum .",
    "these results raises the question of why the fobos experiments @xcite did not see a missing - mass signature in both detector arms , or why @xcite saw no missing - mass signature from cct .      to this date , almost all theoretical research that studies yields and probabilities of cct ,",
    "have been based on macroscopic potential - energy surface calculations with few dimensions , see for example refs .",

    "final states corresponding to three or more fragments are in many cases energetically more favoured than are states of two final fission fragments . in these cases",
    "the nucleus nonetheless divides into only two fragments .",
    "this occurs because the barrier between the ground state and the binary fission valley favours such divisions and a ridge separates the binary from the ternary valley , although dynamical effects may also affect the division . '' _",
    "therefore , a full theoretical treatment determining the probability or yield of cct would require a macroscopic - microscopic or microscopic description with an adequate number of degrees of freedom .",
    "state - of - the - art macroscopic - microscopic calculations of potential - energy surfaces in binary fission are based on a 5-dimensional parameterization including elongation , mass asymmetry , neck radius and deformation of the left and the right fragments @xcite . to find the fission valleys in this 5-dimensional potential - energy surface ,",
    "typically 5 million grid points are calculated @xcite .",
    "an extension to cct with similar details would require in addition five more parameters , namely the mass , deformation and longitudinal position of the ternary fragment , its lateral offset from the fission axis and the second neck radius .",
    "such 10-dimensional potential - energy surface calculations have never been reported and will probably remain beyond computational limitations for some time .",
    "the microscopic description by density functional theory ( dft ) method also explores a multidimensional deformation landscape by constraining the collective degrees of freedom to the lowest multipole orders ( elongation , reflection - asymmetry , necking and triaxiality ) @xcite . again",
    "such a description is already very computing intensive for binary fission and a direct extension covering all degrees of freedom required for ternary fission can not be envisaged at the present .",
    "the original reports by the fobos collaboration @xcite and the previously mentioned theoretical studies of cct favor a sequential @xcite or an `` almost sequential '' @xcite decay model as an interpretation of the fobos experiments .",
    "in such a decay , it is not enough to know if the final result has a high q - value or a low potential - energy surface .",
    "the intermediate steps also have to be studied in detail , as they might be forbidden or improbable .",
    "the latter was shown to be the case for the masses proposed by fobos , as illustrated in our results by the very low , at times even negative , q - value , of the intermediate fragment . even if this is compensated for by excitation energy , it does not mean that the fragment will always fission .",

    "it is known that this model overestimates the real fission barriers @xcite by up to @xmath189  mev .",
    "these fission barriers highlight an overlooked contradiction in the previous theoretical studies on cct . in a sequential or an almost sequential decay , the intermediate fragment must somehow fission .",
    "the low q - values and the high fission barrier together signify that fission of the intermediate fragment is unlikely .",
    "this in turn implies that the yield of binary fission , in which the intermediate fragments mo and cd are formed but do not decay , must be significantly higher than the reported yield of cct of @xmath1 .",
    "no such overabundance of the respective intermediate fragment has been observed .",
    "thus the intermediate mo and cd would need to fission with a very high probability , which is in contradiction with the high fission barrier and the low q - values . to have any probability for fission ,",
    "a considerable excitation energy would be required . as the excitation energy increases , however",
    ", the results have shown that the kinetic energy of the ternary particle approaches zero mev , leading to the case where cct should have been found in previous experiments , described in the previous section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results_discussion ] ) .",
    "more importantly , at high excitation energies , other modes of de - excitation become competitive , most importantly neutron emission , reducing the likelihood of fission .",
    "it is evident that neutron emission in the first fission of the sequential model takes away excitation energy from the system that is essential to enable the second fission step .",
    "therefore it is surprising that fobos concluded from their experiment 3 @xcite on the isotropic emission of about four neutrons in coincidence with cct events . to be isotropic these neutrons",
    "must be emitted at the first scission , not after pre - acceleration of the if .",
    "the excitation energy of the if would be correspondingly reduced by about @xmath165  mev , i.e. effectively preventing any second fission .",
    "clearly this experimental indication can not be reconciled with any sequential or near - sequential model .",
    "the discussion has so far highlighted possible short - comings with the currently favored cct models ( the sequential decay models ) .",
    "this inspired us to study a `` true ternary '' decay model .",
    "it was shown , however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : collinearity_stability_results ] that collinearity is extremely unstable and improbable in ternary fission , since it occurs at an unstable equilibrium point .",
    "thus , it was found that a sufficient perturbation in the ternary particle position or momentum perpendicular to the fission axis breaks collinearity .",
    "furthermore , we found that the threshold in position and momentum for a collinear emission is much smaller than the typical variations governed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "the latter could therefore be responsible for breaking collinear configurations into equatorial emission in ternary fission .",
    "this means that a collinear ( prolate ) scission configuration does not necessarily imply collinear emission , and that equatorial emission does not necessarily imply a triangular ( oblate ) scission configuration . in other words , if cct occurred through ternary fission , it should have been detected previously by triple - coincidence experiments @xcite .",
    "these arguments might hold even for cct occurring through late sequential decay , given recent results showing that in this model , it is indeed possible that the ternary particle deviates from the fission axis @xcite , and that collinearity is broken @xcite .",
    "so far , ternary fission experiments have shown that with rising nuclear charge of the ternary particle , its angular distribution gets narrower and more perpendicular to the fission axis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the collinearity of the heavy and light fragment is lost due to momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of why only collinear events but not ternary events with larger angles would be observed for the mass splits proposed by the fobos collaboration .",
    "initially , our model calculations aimed to guide an independent validation experiment by predicting the physically possible kinetic energy range for cct that has to be covered .",
    "eventually the detailed investigation of currently favored cct models brought to light features that are either unphysical or that would lead to unique experimental observables , some of which are in contrast to previous experiments .    in the most favorable geometrical configuration ,",
    "when the lightest fragment is formed at the center , the light fragment has so little energy that it would barely leave the target , traverse windows and dead layers to deposit enough energy in a detector arm .",
    "hence , such cct events should be clearly visible in any @xmath0 setup as `` missing mass '' events , even without a specific left - right asymmetry as the support grid in the fobos setup .",
    "consequently fobos should have observed a similar pattern in both arms and other two - arm - spectrometers should have observed cct too .",
    "all sequential models implicitly assume a very high fission probability of the intermediate fragment .",
    "however , in reality the fissility of the intermediate fragment is low and its fission barrier is very high ( @xmath190  mev ) . as shown in our calculations , excitation energies of the intermediate fragment far above its fission barrier",
    "are unphysical , hence other de - excitation modes ( neutron and gamma emission ) will largely dominate .",
    "therefore , a given yield of cct would be accompanied by a much higher yield of binary events involving the specific intermediate fragments that did not undergo fission .",
    "such a peculiar pattern of local over - abundance of specific mass splits should have been detected in previous experiments , in particular in @xmath191-spectroscopy with large ge detector arrays .",
    "the inclusion of any realistic excitations would further destroy collinearity .",
    "for example any fragment angular momentum can turn the fission axis of the intermediate fragment with respect to the first fission axis , thus destroying collinearity .",
    "collinear configurations are intrinsically unstable in three - body systems with pure or dominantly repulsive forces .",
    "thus , also for true ternary fission models where both scissions happen synchronously , collinearity is unstable .",
    "our calculations quantify this fact by deriving the very restricted phase space of scission configurations that could lead to somehow collinear configurations after acceleration . even under these simplified model assumptions ,",
    "all but very few of the `` nearly collinear '' scission configurations will after full acceleration result in large angles between the fragments . despite the overwhelming number of true ternary fission scission configurations leading to large angles between the fragments , so far no plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain why only cct events would be observed but not ternary events with larger angles .",
    "our stability calculations imply that the latter should be far more frequent , i.e. leading to an excess yield of ternary mass splits that must have been observed by previous experiments .",
    "in conclusion , our investigation of the currently favored cct models highlights serious discrepancies of model features with experimental observations .",
    "obviously these very simplified models do not include shell effects , collective excitations , angular momenta , etc .",
    "however , in our opinion it is not likely that the explicit inclusion of all these effects could cure the discrepancies of the cct models , namely the intrinsic instability of collinearity in true ternary fission , or the low fission probability of the intermediate fragment in sequential fission .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that today there is no model that could provide a valid explanation of the experimental claims of cct put forward by the fobos collaboration .",
    "therefore , we encourage further critical theoretical studies with more realistic ternary fission models .",
    "more importantly , to truly resolve this matter , experimental verifications are required , which is made possible by covering the kinetic energy ranges derived in this paper , for example with high - resolution fission fragment spectrometers .",
