    "<S> while at first entanglement was recognized to be the most peculiar form of quantum correlations , novel concepts have been introduced to capture either more specific aspects , such as quantum steering @xcite , or , to the other end of the spectrum , more general occurrences . </S>",
    "<S> quantum discord represents the most successful attempt to observe quantum features within the current picture@xcite : it is related to the fact that quantum information in a bipartite system can not be accessed locally without causing an inherent disturbance  at a difference with classical probability distributions .    quantum discord has recently attracted considerable attention , due to its possible , yet controversial , usefulness as a resource in mixed - state quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> there exist in fact architectures for which an exponential improvement over classical resources is obtained @xcite , albeit the entanglement becomes exponentially small @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> discord has then been suggested as the empowering resource , while following investigations contested this interpretation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this debate has stimulated an intense effort into looking at protocols where discord acts a resource : it has been demonstrated that discord does play a role in the activation of multipartite entanglement@xcite , entanglement generation by measurement @xcite , state merging @xcite , and for complete positivity of evolutions @xcite .    in the experimental test of such proposed connections , the comparison of discord with relevant figures of merit </S>",
    "<S> is clearly connected to the ability of estimating with the best precision allowed by a given amount to resources . </S>",
    "<S> a key problem is then to find optimal strategies , and to understand their fundamental limit introducing proper cramr - rao bounds ( crb ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , experimental observation of quantu mdiscord has been undertaken either by direct inspection of the density matrix @xcite , or by using a witness @xcite , however , with no concern about the optimality of the scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> optimal estimation of quantum correlations has been investigated for entanglement @xcite and optimal estimators have been experimentally proved to attain the quantum limit for different families of qubit states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the perspective of quantum metrology , this is highly nontrivial , since there exists no observable directly related to quantum discord . a proper estimator is then needed , which might depend on several characteristic parameters of the quantum state . in such a multiparameter problem , </S>",

    "<S> we found that although homodyne detection is not optimal for gaussian discord , the noise ratio to the ultimate quantum limit is limited to about 10 db . </S>",
    "<S> our findings also show how a suitable bayesian data processing may be employed to improve precision , especially in the estimation of small values of discord .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum discord is defined as the difference between two quantum analogues of classically equivalent expressions of the mutual information in bipartite systems . </S>",
    "<S> its evaluation demands an optimization procedure over the set of all measurements on a given subsystem . for continuous variable system , </S>",
    "<S> such minimisation reveals as an extremely complex task ; however , in the case of gaussian states , we can conveniently restrict the search to gaussian measurement only @xcite , obtaining an expression for the gaussian quantum discord @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> thus correspond to @xmath29 homodyne outcomes @xmath30 the overall sample probability can be evaluated as @xmath31 where the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath32 by measuring the quadrature @xmath33 is a gaussian distribution @xmath34 for squeezed quadratures ( @xmath35 ) we substitute @xmath36 , while for anti - squeezed quadrature ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 . by means of the bayes theorem , we obtain the _ a - posteriori _ </S>",
    "<S> probability @xmath39 where the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the so - called _ a - priori _ probability distributions for the two parameters . in our procedure , we use the results of the inversion estimation to construct these _ a - priori _ distributions . </S>",

    "<S> consequently , its estimation is inherently a multi - parameter problem , and we have to identify the relevant physical parameters to evaluate the correct crb . in the multiparametre scenario , the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) associated to a vector of parameters @xmath49 is in the form of a matrix @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this sets a lower bound on the covariance @xmath51 after @xmath52 repetitions on the experiment : @xmath53 in the specific case of our experiment , we can bound the uncertainty on the discord @xmath54 of the states we prepare as : @xmath55 . while our measurement strategy has the advantage of being simple , it is not expected to be optimal , i.e. to saturate the quantum crb . in order to assess the estimator , i.e. the data processing </S>",
    "<S> , we also need to compare it to the classical crb associated to our specific measurement , which is analogously described by a classical fisher information ( fi ) matrix @xmath56 .    in the evaluation of the correct bound , we need a suitable parametrisation of the state , so that in the expression one parameter only actually varies , while the others are kept fixed : this can not be the case for the number of thermal and squeeing photons , as both of them change with the pump power . therefore , we need to reshape the qfi matrices for different couples of parameters , so to consider those which are more directly connected to the experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering the first couple @xmath57 ; by using the formulas described in @xcite , we obtain @xmath58 as explained above , thermal photons appear because of imperfections in the operation of the opa and because of loss . </S>",

    "<S> next , since the physical parameter that changes during our experiment , resulting in the variation of the amount of discord , is the squeezing parameter @xmath59 ( while @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be considered to remain constant ) , we perform the last change of variable , by considering @xmath67 . again </S>",
    "<S> the qfi matrix can be obtained as @xmath68 , and the bound on the variance for the quantum discord can be easily evaluated as described in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also want to derive the classical crb for quantum discord , that we obtain if we consider as measurement homodyne detection of squeezed and anti - squeezed quadratures of a two - mode squeezed thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> let us start by considering the fisher information matrix we obtain if we want to estimate the two parameters @xmath69 by means of homodyne detection on a certain quadrature @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> since the state is a gaussian state , the conditional probability distribution of measuring a value @xmath71 , is a gaussian function , with zero mean , and variance @xmath72 . by using the formulas in @xcite and evaluaiting some gaussian integrals , </S>",
    "<S> one easily obtains the following formula for the fisher matrix elements @xmath73 where @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers to measure the squeezed or the anti - squeezed quadratures one obtains the following fi matrices : @xmath75 if we perform a fixed number of measurements , where half of them are done on the squeezed quadratures , and the remaining ones on the anti - squeezed quadratures , the overall fi matrix which will give the crb for the two parameters @xmath76 is obtained as @xmath77 to obtain the crb for homodyne detection of gaussian discord , we can proceed as we showed for the quantum crb , simply replacing the qfi matrices , with the fi ones . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the discord obtained using our bayesian estimation are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> uncertainties are within the point size . ]    in the formulae of the bayes rule , we need to multiply several probabilities , which rapidly give a number hardly manageable by reasonable computing power : this sets a limit to the number of quadrature values one can effectively use in about 800 points . in order to use larger samples , we have divided our data in @xmath79 blocks of 200 points for each of the quadratures , calculated the bayesian estimation of the discord for each block , then considered the average weighted on the associated uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the _ a priori _ probabilities are calculated from the whole set of data containing @xmath80 values : as they intervene in the evaluation for each block , the overall number of resources to be considered is @xmath81 .    </S>",

    "<S> we also notice that the point corresponding to the lowest value of the discord is slightly below the quantum crb : this confirms that for low values of the squeezing of the pump , the model we use is not as accurate as in other regimes . for increasing values </S>",
    "<S> , the observed variances depart from the optimum by less than an order of magnitude : as bayesian estimation rapidly converges to optimal , we can attribute this trend to actual variations of the value of the discord in the experiment , becoming more important than statistical fluctuations when the discord increases .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement we have adopted has the considerable advantage of being the simplest experimental option ; however , simplicity always comes at a price , and we do not expect it to deliver the best estimator for discord as established by the quantum crb . in the limit of low discord , we measure a ratio of about 10 db , which tells us that the price we have to pay is quite reasonable . </S>",
