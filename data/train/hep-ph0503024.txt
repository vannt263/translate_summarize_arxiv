    "this is a pure ncqed effect since the qed cross section has no such @xmath45-dependence . before doing this , it is important to determine the range of validity of the approximation @xmath46 . from appendix [ avgxsec ] , @xmath47 has the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 vary between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "we also checked the ncqed corrections to the qed energy and polar angle distributions of one of the photons . while there are some differences in the shapes of the ncqed distributions relative to their qed counterparts , particularly in the energy distribution , using these differences as a test of ncqed appears difficult because of their @xmath42 and energy dependence .",
