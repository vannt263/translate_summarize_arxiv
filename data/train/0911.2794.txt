    "knowing the symmetries of a molecule helps to predict its chemical behavior .",
    "but , what exactly do we mean by `` symmetries ? ''",
    "if we consider only rigid molecules , then the molecular symmetries are rotations , reflections , and reflections composed with rotations .",
    "chemists have defined the _ point group _ of a molecule as its group of rigid symmetries . while this is a useful tool for rigid molecules , it can be misleading when applied to non - rigid molecules .",
    "for example , consider the molecule illustrated in figure [ z3 ] .",
    "the cl on the far left is in front of the page , the cl in the middle is behind the page , and the cl on the right is in the page .",
    "[ htp ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    the point group of the molecule in figure 1 is the cyclic group @xmath2 because the only rigid symmetry of the molecule is a reflection through the plane which contains the three hexagons .",
    "however , the three cl s at the top can rotate around the bond connecting them to the hexagons ( as indicated by the arrow ) while the hexagons themselves remain fixed",
    ". we would like to define a group which includes both the rigid and non - rigid symmetries of molecules .",
    "we begin by defining a _ molecular graph _ as a graph embedded in @xmath3 where the edges represent bonds and the vertices represent atoms or groups of atoms .",
    "we then use the following definition .",
    "an _ automorphism _ of a molecular graph @xmath4 is a permutation of the vertices preserving adjacency , taking atoms of a given type to atoms of the same type ( e.g. , carbons go to carbons , oxygens go to oxygens , and so on ) .",
    "@xmath5 is defined as the group of automorphisms of @xmath4 .",
    "the automorphism group is the group of symmetries of the abstract graph , independent of any embedding in @xmath3 .",
    "however the symmetries of a molecule are only those symmetries of the abstract graph which occur as symmetries of the molecular graph .",
    "in particular , we have the following definition .",
    "we define the _ molecular symmetry group _ of a molecular graph @xmath4 as the subgroup of @xmath5 induced by chemically possible motions taking the molecule to itself together with reflections which take the molecule to itself .",
    "the molecular symmetry group of the graph illustrated in figure [ z3 ] is @xmath6 ( the dihedral group with six elements ) and is generated by the automorphism induced by a planar reflection together with the automorphism induced by a @xmath7 rotation of the three cl s at the top keeping the rest of the graph fixed .",
    "while the molecular symmetry group makes sense chemically , it can not be defined mathematically because the existence of a particular molecular symmetry may depend on the flexibility of the molecule or the possibility of rotating around certain bonds within the molecule . rather than assuming all molecules are completely rigid",
    "as the point group does , we now consider the group obtained by treating all molecules as if they were completely flexible .",
    "the _ topological symmetry group _ of a graph @xmath8 embedded in @xmath3 is the subgroup of @xmath9 induced by diffeomorphisms of the pair @xmath10 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath11    consider the graph of the molecular mbius ladder illustrated in figure [ mobius ] .",
    "this molecule is large enough to be somewhat flexible .",
    "we number some of the vertices so that we can write the automorphisms more conveniently .",
    "the automorphism @xmath12 is induced by turning the molecule upside down .",
    "this is the only non - trivial automorphism which is induced by a rigid symmetry .",
    "thus the point group of the molecule is @xmath2 .",
    "however , the automorphism @xmath13 is induced by rotating the molecule by @xmath7 while slithering the half - twist back to its original position .",
    "thus the topological symmetry group of this molecule is @xmath14 ( the dihedral group of order 12 ) . because of the flexibility of the molecule , this is also the molecular symmetry group .",
    "[ htp ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    while the motivation for the study of topological symmetry groups came from considering the symmetries of non - rigid molecules , we can consider the topological symmetry group of any graph embedded in @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the study of topological symmetry groups is a natural extension of the study of the symmetries of knots .",
    "thus , as is typical in knot theory , we prefer to consider graphs embedded in @xmath1 rather than in @xmath3 .",
    "observe that the topological symmetry group of a graph embedded in @xmath3 is the same as it is if we consider the same embedding of the graph in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a graph embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the _ orientation preserving topological symmetry group _",
    ", @xmath15 , is the subgroup of @xmath11 induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the pair @xmath16 .",
    "observe that either @xmath17 or @xmath15 is a normal subgroup of @xmath11 of index 2 .",
    "so understanding @xmath18 is a key step in understanding @xmath11 . for the rest of this paper we will focus our attention on the orientation preserving topological symmetry group .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity we will abuse terminology and refer to these groups simply as topological symmetry groups .",
    "the general question we are interested in is : for a given graph , what groups can occur as topological symmetry groups ?",
    "in @xcite it was shown that not every finite group can occur as the topological symmetry group of some graph in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 can not be the alternating group @xmath19 for @xmath20 for any embedded graph @xmath8 in @xmath1 . however , there is no known classification of all possible topological symmetry groups of graphs in @xmath1 .",
    "a _ complete graph _",
    ", @xmath21 , is a graph with @xmath22 vertices and an edge between every pair of vertices .",
    "the class of complete graphs is an interesting family of graphs to consider because @xmath23 is the symmetric group @xmath24 , which is the largest automorphism group of any graph with @xmath22 vertices . in @xcite , flapan , naimi , and tamvakis",

    "we characterize what groups can occur as the topological symmetry group of an embedding of any complete graph of the form @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the complete graph theorem , we will make use of several results from other papers .",
    "the following result from @xcite shows us that for 3-connected graphs ( i.e. , those which can not be disconnected or reduced to a single vertex by deleting fewer than 3 vertices ) , we only need to consider topological symmetry groups that are induced by a finite subgroup of @xmath32 ( i.e. , the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 ) .",

    ". then @xmath35 can be re - embedded as @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 is induced by an isomorphic finite subgroup of @xmath39 .",
    "we contrast this result with the example , illustrated in figure [ z3 ] , in which the rotation of the three cl s can not be induced by any finite order diffeomorphism .",
    "observe that the graph in figure 1 can be disconnected by removing a single vertex , and hence it is not 3-connected .",
    "the following theorem classifies which automorphisms of @xmath21 can be induced by a finite order orientation preserving diffeomorphism of some embedding of @xmath21 in @xmath1 . for simplicity we will use the word _",
