    "recently , the opportunistic spectrum access problem has been the focus of significant research activity  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is to allow unlicensed users ( i.e. , cognitive users ) to access the available spectrum when the licensed users ( i.e. , primary users ) are not active .",
    "the presence of high priority primary users and the requirement that the cognitive users should not interfere with them define a new medium access paradigm which we refer to as _ cognitive medium access_. the overarching goal of our work is to develop a unified framework for the design of efficient , and low complexity , cognitive medium access protocols .    the spectral opportunities available to the cognitive users are expected to be time - varying on different time - scales .",
    "for example , on a small scale , multimedia data traffic of the primary users will tend to be bursty  @xcite . on a large scale",
    ", one would expect the activities of each user to vary throughout the day .",
    "therefore , to avoid interfering with the primary network , the cognitive users must first probe to determine whether there are primary activities in each channel before transmission . under the assumption that each cognitive user can not access all of the available channels simultaneously",
    ", the main task of the medium access protocol is to distributively choose which channels each cognitive user should attempt to use in different time slots , in order to fully ( or maximally ) utilize the spectral opportunities .",
    "this decision process can be enhanced by taking into account any available statistical information about the primary traffic .",
    "for example , with a single cognitive user capable of accessing ( sensing ) only one channel at a time , the problem becomes trivial if the probability that each channel is free is known _ a priori_. in this case ,",
    "the optimal rule is for the cognitive user to access the channel with the highest probability of being free in all time slots .",
    "however , such time - varying traffic information is typically not available to the cognitive users _ a priori_. the need to learn this information on - line creates a fundamental tradeoff between exploitation and exploration .",
    "exploitation refers to the short - term gain resulting from accessing the channel with the estimated highest probability of being free ( based on the results of previous sensing decisions ) whereas exploration is the process by which the cognitive user learns the statistical behavior of the primary traffic ( by choosing possibly different channels to probe across time slots ) . in the presence of multiple cognitive users ,",
    "the medium access algorithm must also account for the competition between different users over the same channel .",
    "in this paper , we develop a unified framework for the design and analysis of cognitive medium access protocols .",
    "as argued in the sequel , this framework allows for the construction of strategies that strike an optimal balance among exploration , exploitation and competition .",
    "the key observation motivating our approach is the equivalence between our problem and the classical multi - armed bandit problem ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this equivalence allows for building a solid foundation for cognitive medium access using tools from reinforcement machine learning  @xcite .",
    "the connection between cognitive medium access and the multi - armed bandit problem has been independently and concurrently observed in  @xcite .",
    "that work , however , is limited to special cases of the general approach presented here .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite , the channels are assumed to be independent and the goal is to maximize the discounted sum of throughput , which is the problem addressed in example  [ exmpl : ind ] in section  [ sec : full ] below .",
    "a related work also appears in  @xcite , in which the availability of each channel is assumed to follow a markov chain , whose transition matrix is known to the cognitive user .",
    "the only uncertainty faced by the cognitive user in that work is the particular realization of the channel , while in our work the cognitive users also need to learn the statistics of the channel in real time .",
    "we consider three scenarios in this paper . in the first scenario",
    ", we assume the existence of a single cognitive user capable of accessing only a single channel at any given time . in this",
    "setting , we derive an optimal sensing rule that maximizes the expected throughput obtained by the cognitive user . compared with a genie - aided scheme , in which the cognitive user knows _ a priori _ the primary network traffic information , there is a throughput loss suffered by any medium access strategy .",
    "we obtain a lower bound on this loss and further construct a linear complexity single index protocol that achieves this lower bound asymptotically ( when the primary traffic behavior changes very slowly ) . in the second scenario , we design distributed sensing rules that account for the competitive dimension of the problem in which the cognitive users must also take the competition from other cognitive users into consideration when making sensing decisions .",
    "we first characterize the optimal distributed sensing rule for the case in which the traffic information of the primary network is available to the cognitive users . under this idealistic assumption , we show that the throughput loss of the proposed distributed sensing rule , compared with a throughput optimal centralized scheme , goes to zero exponentially as the number of cognitive users increases . to prevent any possible misbehavior by the cognitive users , we further design a game theoretically fair sensing rule , whose loss compared with the throughput optimal centralized rule",
    "also goes to zero exponentially . building on these results ,",
    "we then devise distributed sensing rules that do not require prior knowledge about the traffic and converge to the optimal distributed rule and game theoretically fair rule , respectively . in the third scenario ,",
    "we extend our work to the case in which the cognitive user is capable of accessing more than one channel simultaneously .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our network model is detailed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : full ] analyzes the scenario in which a single cognitive user capable of sensing one channel at a time is present .",
    "the extension to the multi - user case is reported in section  [ sec : mulp ] whereas the multi - channel extension is studied in section  [ sec : multisensing ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : con ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "throughout this paper , upper - case letters ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) denote random variables , lower - case letters ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) denote realizations of the corresponding random variables , and calligraphic letters ( e.g , @xmath2 ) denote finite alphabet sets over which corresponding variables range .",
    "also , upper - case boldface letters ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) denote random vectors and lower - case boldface letters ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) denote realizations of the corresponding random vectors .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] shows the channel model of interest .",
    "we consider a primary network consisting of @xmath5 channels , @xmath6 , each with bandwidth @xmath7 .",
    "the users in the primary network are operated in a synchronous time - slotted fashion .",
    "we use @xmath8 to refer to the channel index , @xmath9 to refer to the time - slot index and @xmath10 referring to the index of the cognitive users .",
    "we assume that at each time slot , channel @xmath8 is free with probability @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a random variable that equals @xmath13 if channel @xmath8 is free at time slot @xmath9 and equals @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "hence , given @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a bernoulli random variable with probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the delta function .",
    "furthermore , for a given @xmath17 , @xmath12 are independent for each @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a block varying model in which the value of @xmath18 is fixed for a block of @xmath19 time slots and randomly changes at the beginning of the next block according to some joint pdf @xmath20 .",
    "our results can also be extended to the scenarios in which @xmath21s follow a markov chain model .    in our model , the cognitive users attempt to exploit the availability of free channels in the primary network by sensing the activity at the beginning of each time slot .",
    "our work seeks to characterize efficient strategies for choosing which channels to sense ( access ) .",
    "the challenge here stems from the fact that the cognitive users are assumed to be unaware of @xmath18 _ a priori_. we consider two cases in which the cognitive user either has or does not have prior information about the pdf of @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath20 . to further illustrate the point , let us consider our first scenario in which a single cognitive user capable of sensing only one channel is present . at time",
    "slot @xmath9 , the cognitive user selects one channel @xmath22 to access .",
    "if the sensing result shows that channel @xmath23 is free , i.e. , @xmath24 , the cognitive user can send @xmath7 bits over this channel ; otherwise , the cognitive user will wait until the next time slot and pick a possibly different channel to access ( throughout the paper , it is assumed that the outcome of the sensing algorithm is error free ) . therefore , the total number of bits that the cognitive user is able to send over one block ( of @xmath19 time slots ) is @xmath25    it is now clear that @xmath26 is a random variable that depends on the traffic in the primary network and , more importantly for us , on the medium access protocols employed by the cognitive user .",
    "therefore , the overarching goal of section  [ sec : full ] is to construct low complexity medium access protocols that maximize @xmath27    intuitively , the cognitive user would like to select that channel with the highest probability of being free in order to obtain more transmission opportunities . if @xmath18 is known then this problem is trivial : the cognitive user should choose the channel @xmath28 to sense .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath18 imposes a fundamental tradeoff between exploration , in order to learn @xmath18 , and exploitation , by accessing the channel with the highest estimated free probability based on current available information , as detailed in the following sections .",
    "we start by developing the optimal solution to the single user ",
    "single channel scenario under the idealized assumption that @xmath20 is known _ a priori _ by the cognitive user .",
    "as argued next , the optimal medium access algorithm suffers from a prohibitive computational complexity that grows exponentially with the block length @xmath19 .",
    "this motivates the design of low complexity asymptotically optimal approaches that are considered next .",
    "interestingly , the proposed low complexity technique does not require prior knowledge about @xmath20 .",
    "our single user ",
    "single channel cognitive medium access problem belongs to the class of bandit problems . in this setting",
    ", the decision maker must sequentially choose one process to observe from @xmath29 stochastic processes .",
    "these processes usually have parameters that are unknown to the decision maker and , associated with each observation is a utility function .",
    "the objective of the decision maker is to maximize the sum or discounted sum of the utilities via a strategy that specifies which process to observe for every possible history of selections and observations .",
    "the following classical example illustrates the challenge facing our decision maker : a gambler enters a casino having @xmath5 slot machines , the @xmath30 of which has winning probability @xmath31 .",
    "the gambler does not know the values of the @xmath11s and must sequentially chooses machines to play .",
    "the goal is to maximize the overall gain for a total of @xmath19 plays . in this example , the stochastic processes are the outcomes of the slot machines , the utility function is the reward that the gambler gains each time and the gambling strategy specifies which machine to play based on each possible past information pattern . a comprehensive treatment covering different variants of bandit problems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to rigorously formulate our problem .",
    "the cognitive user employs a medium access strategy @xmath32 , which will select channel @xmath22 to sense at time slot @xmath9 for any possible causal information pattern obtained through the previous @xmath33 observations : @xmath34 i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "notice that @xmath36 is the sensing outcome of the @xmath9th time slot , in which @xmath37 is the channel being accessed . if @xmath38 , there is no accumulated information , thus @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath32 could be stochastic , i.e. , for certain @xmath41 , the cognitive user may randomly pick channel @xmath8 from a set @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 .",
    "the utility that the cognitive user obtains by making decision @xmath23 at time slot @xmath9 is the number of bits it can transmit at time slot @xmath9 , which is @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the expected value of the payoff obtained by a cognitive user who uses strategy @xmath32 as @xmath46    we denote @xmath47 , which is the largest throughput that the cognitive user could obtain when the spectral opportunities are governed by @xmath20 and the exact value of each realization of @xmath18 is not known by the user .    each medium access decision made by the cognitive user",
    "has two effects .",
    "the first one is the short term gain , i.e. , an immediate transmission opportunity if the chosen channel is found free .",
    "the second one is the long term gain , i.e. , the updated statistical information about @xmath20 .",
    "this information will help the cognitive user in making better decisions in the future stages .",
    "there is an interesting tradeoff between the short and long term gains .",
    "if we only want to maximize the short term gain , we can pick the one with the highest free probability to sense , based on the current information .",
    "this myopic strategy maximally exploits the existing information . on the other hand , by picking other channels to sense , we gain valuable statistical information about @xmath20 which can effectively guide future decisions .",
    "this process is typically referred to as exploration .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath48 be the updated pdf after making @xmath33 observations .",
    "we begin with @xmath49 . after observing @xmath36 , we update the pdf using the following bayesian formula .    1 .",
    "if @xmath50 @xmath51 2 .",
    "if @xmath52 @xmath53    now , lemma 2.3.1 of  @xcite proves that every bandit problem with finite horizon has an optimal solution .",
    "applying this result to our set - up , we obtain the following .    [",
    "lem : optimal ] for any prior pdf @xmath54 , there exists an optimal strategy @xmath55 to the channel selection problem  , and @xmath56 is achievable .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 satisfies the following condition : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the conditional pdf updated using   and   as if the cognitive user chooses @xmath60 and observes @xmath61 .",
    "also , @xmath62 is the value of a bandit problem with prior information @xmath59 and @xmath63 sequential observations.@xmath64    in principle , lemma  [ lem : optimal ] provides the solution to problem  .",
    "effectively , it decouples the calculation at each stage , and hence , allows the use of dynamic programming to solve the problem .",
    "the idea is to solve the channel selection problem with a smaller dimension first and then use backward deduction to obtain the optimal solution for a problem with a larger dimension . starting with @xmath65 ,",
    "the second term inside the expectation in   is 0 , since @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the optimal solution is to choose channel @xmath8 with the largest @xmath67 , which can be calculated as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    with the solution for @xmath65 at hand , we can now solve the @xmath70 case using  . at first , for every possible choice of @xmath60 and possible observation @xmath71 , we calculate the updated pdf @xmath72 using   and .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath73 ( which is equivalent to the @xmath65 problem described above ) .",

    "similarly , after solving the @xmath70 problem , one can proceed to solve the @xmath81 case . using this procedure recursively",

    "hence , if the cognitive user ignores the information gained from sensing , it should always choose channel @xmath13 to sense , resulting in an average throughput of @xmath91 bits per block .",

    "<S> this paper establishes the equivalence between cognitive medium access and the competitive multi - armed bandit problem . </S>",
    "<S> first , the scenario in which a single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of empty frequency bands in the spectrum with multiple bands is considered . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the availability probability of each channel is unknown to the cognitive user a priori . </S>",
    "<S> hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a balance between exploring the availability of other free channels and exploiting the opportunities identified thus far . by adopting a bayesian approach for this classical bandit problem , </S>",
    "<S> the optimal medium access strategy is derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples . to avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of the optimal strategy , a low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed strategy does not require any prior statistical knowledge about the traffic pattern on the different channels . </S>",
    "<S> next , the multi - cognitive user scenario is considered and low complexity medium access protocols , which strike the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments , are developed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , this formalism is extended to the case in which each cognitive user is capable of sensing and using multiple channels simultaneously . </S>"
