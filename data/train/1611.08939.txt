    "the cylindrical reentrant cavity is a device that can provide high - q microwave modes with large tuning ranges .",
    "it consists of a metal cavity with a conducting post or ring located centrally within the cavity .",
    "the gap between the top of this post or ring and the top of the cavity adjusts the mode frequency and at certain gap spacings traps the electric field within the gap .",
    "such cavity designs have been extensively studied and allow for a standard reentrant mode tuning range on the order of ghz without the need for physically large cavities .",
    "@xcite    since this structure was first investigated in connection with the development of klystrons , it has been widely used in the construction of microwave oscillators and particle accelerators@xcite , and is often chosen as a structure in the study of metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "some recent work has discussed potential applications in telecommunications  @xcite , and detection of gravitational waves  @xcite and dark matter  @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting perspective to view the standard reentrant mode as a perturbed @xmath0 mode .",
    "the standard reentrant mode transforms into the empty cavity @xmath0 mode as the central post is removed from the cavity  @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", there exist higher order reentrant modes , which can be viewed as perturbed @xmath1 modes .    in this work",
    "we unequivocally demonstrate the existence of these higher order reentrant modes and characterize them in terms of their tuning range , and quality factor .",
    "section ii presents a theoretical study of these modes based on finite element analysis , and experimental data follows in section iii .",
    "finally , these results are summarized and concluded in section iv .",

    "grey represents the empty cavity space , while the metallic cavity region is represented by grid - lined white area .",
    "the height of cavity is @xmath30.4 m and the diameter of the inner wall is 0.1337 m. the diameter of the central post is 0.024 m. the gap changes from 0.0001 m to 0.4 m in the simulation . ]",
    "filling factors for multiple reentrant modes as a function of gap size . ]",
    "+     +     + we employed the comsol multiphysics software to simulate a reentrant cavity structure . since the single post reentrant cavity is an axisymmetric structure , it sufficed to use 2d modelling , with revolution around the z - axis .",
    "the structure of interest is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we find that multiple higher order modes in the single post reentrant cavity follow similar mode structures to the standard reentrant mode .",
    "all of the these modes have the same dominant field components : the axial electric field , @xmath4 , which is located in the region directly above the post and below the top of the cavity , the azimuthal magnetic field @xmath5 , which is separated into several rings surrounding the central post , in alternating phase , and a radial electric field , @xmath6 , due to the gradient of @xmath5 in the z direction .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the features of these modes .",
    "the main feature of interest in the higher order modes is the azimuthal magnetic field , which alternates in direction between clockwise and counter - clockwise around the post .",
    "we name these higher order modes by their axial wave number , or the number of these  magnetic rings \" minus one . unlike the standard reentrant mode , the higher order modes store their electric energy both in the gap region and cylinder region . the former is determined by the strong @xmath4 field in the central post gap region , and the latter is determined by the radial electric field in the cylinder region which is strongest at the nodes of magnetic field between the  magnetic rings \" .",
    "because of the existence of a radial electric field , higher order mode filling factors differ from the standard reentrant mode .",
    "this can be readily observed when the size of the gap becomes very small .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the @xmath4 filling factor of different modes , defined as @xmath7    0.45     0.45     [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where @xmath8 is the electric field in the cavity . when the gap is of the order of mm , the capacitance of the structure formed by the two planes ( the top of the post and the top of the cavity ) becomes large , and the electric field in this area becomes stronger . in the standard reentrant mode , without other components of electric field outside the gap region ,",
    "the @xmath4 filling factor approaches unity .",
    "however , because the filling factor is related to the integration volume , and due to the existence of radial electric field components in the larger non - gap region , the ez filling factors of higher order modes may first increase as the gap decreases but eventually approaches zero when the volume of the gap region becomes small .",
    "each higher order mode is slightly different , the first higher order mode reaches a maximum @xmath4 filing factor ( about 0.2 ) when the gap is around 0.0015 m , yet other modes @xmath4 filling factors continually decrease as the gap becomes smaller .",
    "unlike the standard reentrant mode , these higher order mode frequencies do not tend to zero as the gap size tends to zero , as their effective capacitance does not tend to infinity due again to the existence of radial electric field components .",
    "these modes transition to coaxial modes of fixed frequency when the gap size becomes zero  @xcite .",
    "a common use of a reentrant cavity structure is to utilize the transformation process from empty cavity modes to reentrant modes in order to achieve high frequency tuning ranges . we find that then nth order reentrant mode arises from the transition of a tm01n mode in an empty cylindrical cavity .    figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and  [ fig:5 ] show the transformation process of the 1st and 2nd higher order modes .",
    "as we can see in the figures , because @xmath9 and @xmath10 exhibit periodic change in @xmath11 direction magnetic field , the transformation process is complex . as the post moves out of the cavity the top  magnetic ring \" will transform into the upper lobe of the @xmath1 empty cylinder mode . as the post continues to move the other rings do the same .",
    "the higher order modes undergoes multiple transition phases , from coaxial to reentrant , and from reentrant to empty cylinder via a ` pseudo - tm ' phase where some of the  magnetic rings \" have become empty cavity lobes .",
    "each mode transitions slightly differently , due to the number of  magnetic rings \" and lobes in the empty cavity mode .",
    "these transition phases affect frequency tuning .",
    "we have calculated the resonant mode properties as the gap size changes from 0.1 mm to @xmath340 cm .",
    "fig  [ fig:6 ] shows the eigenfrequencies of different reentrant modes .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] lists tuning ranges of the standard reentrant mode and some high order modes first phases .",
    "as mentioned , higher order modes go through multiple phases , with the first phase , the purely reentrant phase , exhibiting the largest tuning range .",
    "after this point the modes become quite crowded in frequency space , as they are nearly at the frequencies of the corresponding empty cavity tm modes . by",
    "monitoring different modes , it is possible tune through different frequency ranges at the same time , which would be beneficial in many fundamental physics tests such as searches for dark matter and gravitational waves .    we have also characterized these modes in terms of their geometry factor , which is directly proportional to mode quality factor @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the surface resistivity of the metal .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the geometry factors as a function of gap size for various reentrant modes .",
    "it is obvious that the geometric factor of higher order modes is much higher than that of the standard mode .",
    "high - q modes are highly sought after in fundamental physics tests  @xcite , which makes these modes promising candidates .",
    "the properties of the resonant modes were measured with a vector network analyzer to acquire the complex value of s21 in transmission  @xcite .",
    "two loop probes were used for the measurement .",
    "one probe was located near the base of the central post through a 1-mm - diameter hole in the lid of the cavity , whilst the other was inserted through a hole on the side wall .",
    "both of these probes were used to couple to the @xmath5 field component .",
    "[ fig:8 ] is the device used for the measurement , which consists of an empty cylindrical cavity , a conducting central post , and a micrometer for the movement of the post .",
    "the setup was used to track the frequency of the 1st and 2nd higher order modes , and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] . on average ,",
    "the experimental mode frequencies differed from the theory by less than 3% .",
    "s / m . ]    mode quality factor was also measured .",
    "[ fig:10 ] shows the experimental and theoretical data for the 1st higher order mode .",
    "the theoretical data uses the geometry factors derived from the finite element analysis , and an electrical conductivity of @xmath14  s / m , which was found from a fit to the experimental data .",
    "this value is considerably lower than the accepted value of electrical conductivity for brass ( @xmath15  s / m  @xcite ) , some potential reasons for this are discussed below .",
    "we chose to utilize the fit value for the conductivity in order to demonstrate that although the quality factors are lower than anticipated , they do follow the correct trend , ie the quality factor goes through a sharp increase when gap size is around 0.25 m , which fits modelled geometry factors well .",
    "[ fig:11 ] shows the effective surface resistance calculated from the theoretical geometric factor and experimental quality factors according to eq  [ eq : q ] .",
    "the average effective surface resistance is @xmath33.81  @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to note that this high value of resistance ( and low value of conductivity ) is only an effective surface resistance , as the losses in this system are not limited by the conducting surface .",
    "the main reason for this high effective surface resistance is the small gap between the post and the hole in the cavity lid that the post slides through .",
    "no rf choke was employed where gaps are present as is common in such measurements  @xcite .",
    "the post is not directly connected to the cavity in order to allow it to move , this both introduces an extra capacitance and allows considerable radiation leakage , which increases the effective surface resistance .",
    "furthermore , experiments with reentrant cavities in the past have observed discrepancy between experimental and theoretical quality factors  @xcite and attribute this to a number of factors , such as joins between cavity lids and bodies , the existence of probes and probe holes , and loading of the resonance by the external measurement circuit .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the existence of higher order reentrant modes with higher frequencies than the fundamental in the single - post cylrindrical reentrant cavity .",
    "we have verified our finite - element modelling by comparison with experimental data , and the agreement is good .",
    "we find that the higher order reentrant modes arise from perturbed @xmath1 modes in empty cylinders , and finally convert to coaxial modes when the gap size becomes zero .",
    "the higher order reentrant modes have higher geometry factors when compared to the standard reentrant mode .",
    "we have found and characterized the different phases that exist in the transformation process .",
    "these modes have possible applications in a number of fundamental physics tests , such as gravity wave and dark matter detection experiments .",
    "furthermore , it is worth considering that an understanding of these reentrant modes affords us a deeper understanding of the highly localized  gap modes \" present in many experiments . for example",
    ", it has been discussed that axion haloscope experiments utilizing tuning rods to adjust mode frequency can have their sensitivity degraded by the presence of highly localized modes which arise due to the small gap between the end of the tuning rod and the walls of the cavity , which must exist for real tuning rods  @xcite .",
