    "in the standard model ( sm ) , fermions acquire masses via spontaneous breakdown of su(2 ) gauge symmetry . however , the values of fermion masses and the observed hierarchical fermion spectra are not understood within the sm .",
    "this results in thirteen free parameters in the sm which includes three charged lepton masses , six quark masses and the four parameters of the ckm matrix .",
    "the symmetries of the sm do not allow non - zero neutrino masses through renormalizable yukawa couplings . however ,",
    "non - zero neutrino masses can be introduced via non - renormalizable higher dimensional operators presumably having their origin in physics beyond the sm .",
    "texture zeros , flavor symmetries , radiative mechanisms and the see - saw mechanisms are some of the widely discussed mechanisms for fermion mass generation .",
    "these mechanisms , most often , complement and reinforce each other . in the ongoing decade , significant advances have been made in understanding these mechanisms .",
    "in particular texture zeros and flavor symmetries have provided quantitative relationships between flavor mixing angles and the quark / lepton mass ratios .",
    "it has , now been realized that the `` see - saw gut '' scenario , on its own , can not provide a complete understanding of the flavor structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices and new physics seems to be essential perhaps in the form of new symmetries mainly in the lepton sector .",
    "moreover , a unified description of flavor physics and cp - violation in the quark and lepton sectors is absolutely necessary .",
    "this can be achieved by constructing a low energy effective theory with the sm and some discrete non - abelian family symmetry and , subsequently , embedding this theory into grand unified theory ( gut ) models like so(10)@xcite .",
    "for this reason , the discrete symmetry will have to be a subgroup of so(3 ) or su(3)@xcite .",
    "the search for an adequate discrete symmetry has mainly focussed on the minimal subgroups of these groups with at least one singlet and one doublet irreducible representation to accommodate the fermions belonging to each generation .",
    "one such subgroup is the quaternion group @xmath1@xcite which not only accommodates the three generations of fermions but also explains the rather large difference between values of 2 - 3 mixings in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "quaternion symmetry like some other discrete symmetries leads to nontrivial relationships amongst the non - zero mass matrix elements which underscores the inadequacy of texture zero analyses@xcite in isolation .",
    "such textures which have equalities between different elements alongwith the vanishing of some elements of the mass matrix have been referred to as hybrid textures in the literature .",
    "frigerio and smirnov@xcite presented a comprehensive analysis of the hybrid textures alongwith other possibilities for the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the detailed numerical analysis of sixty possible hybrid textures with one equality amongst mass matrix elements and one texture zero was presented by kaneko _",
    "_ @xcite who found fifty four out of sixty to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "hybrid textures have , also , been discussed more recently@xcite though in a somewhat different context .    in the present work , we present a detailed and improved numerical analysis of the hybrid textures found to be viable in the earlier numerical analysis by kaneko _",
    "our analysis shows that only twenty three out of a total of sixty possible hybrid textures are phenomenologically viable .",
    "we examine the phenomenological implications of the viable hybrid textures .",
    "these hybrid textures have different hierarchical spectra and have different phenomenological consequences .",
    "we find the values of majorana type cp - violating phases for which these textures are realized .",
    "we , also , calculate the effective majorana mass and jarlskog rephasing invariant @xmath2 for all viable hybrid textures of neutrinos .",
    "in addition , we present correlation plots between different parameters of the hybrid textures of neutrinos for @xmath3 allowed ranges of the known parameters .",
    "it is found that positive results from neutrinoless double beta decay experiments will rule out three more hybrid textures with one equality between the matrix elements and one zero .",
    "thus , the investigation of majorana type cp - violating phases will be significant .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix , @xmath4 , can be parameterized in terms of three neutrino mass eigenvalues ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and one dirac type cp - violating phase , @xmath0 . if neutrinos are majorana particles then there are two additional cp - violating phases @xmath11 , @xmath12 in the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "thus , massive majorana neutrinos increase the number of free parameters of the sm from thirteen to twenty two . in the charged lepton basis",
    "the complex symmetric mass matrix @xmath4 can be diagonalized by a complex unitary matrix @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the diagonal neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath13@xcite can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the matrix @xmath13 is called the neutrino mixing matrix or pmns matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath19 is the lepton analogue of the ckm quark mixing matrix and the phase matrix @xmath20 contains the two majorana phases . therefore the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath21 the elements of the neutrino mass matrix can be calculated from eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in hybrid textures of neutrinos , we have one equality of matrix elements and one zero.i.e .",
    "@xmath22    these two conditions yield two complex equations as follows @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath19 has been defined in eq .",
    "these two complex equations involve nine physical parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and three cp - violating phases @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be calculated from the mass - squared differences @xmath31 and @xmath32 using the relations @xmath33 and @xmath34 thus , we have two complex equations relating five unknown parameters viz .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , if one out of these five parameters is assumed , other four parameters can be predicted .",
    "solving eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) simultaneously , we obtain @xmath36 and @xmath37 using eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , the two mass ratios @xmath38 and the two majorana phases ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) can be written as @xmath39 @xmath40    @xmath41    and @xmath42 both the majorana phases @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eqs . ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath0 whereas the mass ratios @xmath38 are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath0 since @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are known experimentally .",
    "the values of mass ratios @xmath38 , from eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) can be used to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "the mass eigenvalue @xmath35 can be written in terms of two mass squared differences which are known from experiments . @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 the two values of @xmath5 obtained above from the two mass ratios must be equal to within the errors of the mass squared differences . using the experimental inputs of the two mass squared differences and the two mixing angles we can constrain the ( @xmath10 , @xmath0 ) plane .",
    "the experimental constraints on neutrino parameters with @xmath47@xcite errors are given below : @xmath48 only an upper bound is known on the mixing angle @xmath10 from the chooz experiment .",
    "we vary the oscillation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 within their full physical ranges with uniform distributions .",
    "we , also , calculate the effective majorana mass , which is given as @xmath49 and jarlskog rephasing invariant quantity@xcite @xmath50 within the allowed parameter space for all allowed hybrid textures . in our numerical analysis",
    "we generate as many as @xmath51 data points ( @xmath52 data points were generated in the previous analysis@xcite ) thus , making our numerical analysis more reliable .",
    "earlier analysis of hybrid textures@xcite used the ratio of two known mass - squared differences @xmath53 to constrain the other neutrino parameters . however ,",
    "our analysis makes direct use of the two mass - squared differences and is more constraining .",
    "earlier analysis does not use the full experimental information currently available with us in the form of two mass - squared differences .",
    "moreover , since @xmath54 is a function of mass ratios , it does not depend upon the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "it is obvious that the two mass ratios @xmath55 and @xmath56 may yield the experimentally allowed values of @xmath54 for mutually inconsistent values of @xmath35 .",
    "however , our analysis selects only those mass ratios for which the values of @xmath35 obtained from eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) are identical to within the errors of the mass squared differences .",
    "moreover , the definition of @xmath54 used in many earlier analysis does not make use of the knowledge of solar mass hierarchy to constrain the neutrino parameter space .",
    "our numerical analysis restricts the number of allowed hybrid textures to twenty three at 99% c.l . as enumerated in table 1 .",
    "all the allowed hybrid textures of neutrinos give hierarchical spectrum of neutrino masses .",
    "there are ten textures with clear normal hierarchy , two with inverted hierarchy , and one with all hierarchies .",
    "the remaining ten textures give normal and quasi - degenerate spectrum as given in table 2 .",
    "table 3 . depicts the lower bound on @xmath10 for viable hybrid textures .",

    "daya bay has a higher sensitivity and plans to observe @xmath57 down to 0.01@xcite .",
    "thus some of these textures will face stringent experimental scrutiny in the immediate future .",
    "we have , also , calculated the effective majorana mass which is the absolute value of @xmath58 element of neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay which is controlled by effective majorana mass is forbidden for texture @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 for these textures .",
    "table 4 . gives the lower bound on @xmath58 for the remaining hybrid textures of neutrinos .",
    "the analysis of @xmath58 will be significant as many neutrinoless double beta decay experiments will give the predictions on this parameter .",
    "a most stringent constraint on the value of @xmath58 was obtained in the @xmath63 heidelberg - moscow experiment@xcite @xmath64ev .",
