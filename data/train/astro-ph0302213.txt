    "polarization on these scales directly probes the poorly - understood process of reionization .",

    "precise predictions can be made of the average polarization pattern expected from a given power spectrum of temperature anisotropy ( @xcite ; for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the pattern of polarization on the sky is a vector field with both an amplitude and direction at each point , and can be separated into two scalar fields , one giving the curl and the other the gradient component ( called @xmath14 and @xmath15 modes in analogy with electromagnetic fields ) .",

    "dasi reports an @xmath15 mode signal significant at 4.9@xmath17 and a te temperature - polarization correlation significant at 2@xmath17 .",
    "both signals are consistent with the `` concordance '' cosmological model ( spatially flat model dominated by a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) and support an adiabatic origin for the cmb temperature anisotropy .",

    "each radiometer differences the signal in the accepted polarization between two positions on the sky ( the a and b beams ) , separated by @xmath21 .",

    "we avoid this problem by differencing the outputs of the two radiometers in each differencing assembly in the time - ordered data . denoting the two radiometers by subscripts 1 and 2 ,",
    "the instantaneous outputs are @xmath25 and @xmath26 the sum @xmath27 is thus proportional to the unpolarized intensity , while the difference @xmath28 is proportional only to the polarization .",

    "simulations of the mapping algorithm demonstrate that _ wmap _ can accurately recover the polarization pattern on the sky , even after allowing for residual calibration uncertainty in the individual radiometer channels .",

    "cross - correlations between maps are largely unaffected by striping or any other channel - specific signal , allowing much simpler analysis of the faint polarization signal than would be possible for the individual @xmath1 or @xmath2 maps .",
    "this paper discusses the temperature - polarization ( te ) correlation in the _ wmap _ one - year sky maps .",
    "we compute the temperature - polarization cross - correlation using three different techniques : the two - point correlation function , a quadratic estimator for the power spectrum , and a `` template '' comparison in pixel space between the polarization maps and the predicted polarization given the observed pattern of temperature anisotropy .",
    "all three methods yield similar results despite disparate treatments of the data .",
    "the simplest measure of temperature - polarization cross - correlation is the two - point angular correlation function @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are pixel indices and @xmath36 are the weights . to avoid possible effects of @xmath37 noise",
    ", we force the temperature map to come from a different frequency band than the polarization maps , and thus use the temperature map at 61 ghz ( v band ) for all correlations except the v - band polarization maps , which we correlate against the 41 ghz ( q band ) temperature map . since _",
    "wmap _ has a high signal - to - noise ratio measurement of the cmb temperature anisotropy , we use unit weight ( @xmath38 ) for the temperature maps and noise weight ( @xmath39 ) for the polarization maps , where @xmath40 is the effective number of observations in each pixel @xmath35 and @xmath41 is the standard deviation of the white noise in the time - ordered data ( table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the correlation functions to monte carlo simulations of a null model , which simulates the temperature anisotropy using the best - fit @xmath7cdm model @xcite but forces the polarization signal to zero .",

    "it is clear that _ wmap _ detects a temperature - polarization signal at high statistical confidence , and that signals exist on both large and small angular scales .",
    "we define a goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath43_a ~ { \\bf m}^{-1}_{ab } ~ [ c^{iq}_{\\rm map } - \\langle c^{iq}_{\\rm sim } \\rangle ] _ b , \\label{chi_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the co - added correlation function from _ wmap _ data , @xmath45 is the mean from the monte carlo simulations , and @xmath46 is the covariance matrix between angular bins @xmath47 and @xmath48 derived from the simulations .",
    "we find @xmath49 for 78 degrees of freedom when comparing _ wmap _ to the null model : _ wmap _ detects temperature - polarization correlations significant at more than 10 standard deviations .",
    "having detected a significant signal in the data , we must determine whether this signal has a cosmological origin or results from systematic errors or foreground sources .",
    "we test the convergence of the mapping algorithm using end - to - end simulations , comparing maps derived from simulated time - ordered data to the input maps used to generate the simulated time series .",
    "the simulations include all major instrumental effects , including beam ellipticity , radiometer performance , and instrument noise ( including @xmath37 component ) , and are processed using the same map - making software as the _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps converge rapidly , within the 30 iterations required to derive the calibration solution .",
    "correlations in the time - ordered data introduce an anti - correlation in the @xmath2 map at angles corresponding to the beam separation , with amplitude 0.5% of the noise in the map .",
    "this effect is independent for each radiometer and does not affect temperature - polarization cross - correlations . similarly , residual @xmath37 noise in the time series can create faint striping in the maps , but does not affect cross - correlations .    the largest potential systematic error in the temperature - polarization cross - correlation results from bandpass mismatches in the amplification / detection chains .",
    "we calibrate the _ wmap _ data in thermodynamic temperature using the doppler dipole from the satellite s orbit about the sun as a beam - filling calibration source @xcite .",
    "astrophysical sources with a spectrum other than a 2.7 k blackbody are thus slightly mis - calibrated .",
    "the amplitude is dependent on the product of the source spectrum with the unique bandpass of each radiometer .",
    "if the bandpasses in each radiometer were identical , the effect would cancel for any frequency spectrum , but differences in the bandpasses between the two radiometers in each da generate a non - zero residual in the difference signal used to generate polarization maps ( eq . [ diff_def ] ) .",
    "this signal is spatially correlated with the unpolarized foreground intensity but is independent of the orientation of the radiometers on the sky ( polarization angle @xmath24 ) . in the limit of uniform sampling of @xmath24",
    "this term drops out of the sky map solution .",
    "however , the _ wmap _ scan pattern does not view each pixel in all orientations ; unpolarized emission with a non - cmb spectrum can thus be aliased into polarization if the bandpasses of the two radiometers in each da are not identical .",
    "this is a significant problem only at 23 ghz ( k band ) , where the foregrounds are brightest and the bandpass mismatch is largest .",
    "we quantify the effect of bandpass mismatch using end - to - end simulations . for each time - ordered sample ,",
    "we compute the signal in each radiometer using an unpolarized foreground model and the measured pass bands in each output channel @xcite .",
    "we then generate maps from the simulated data using the _ wmap _ one - year sky coverage and compute @xmath42 using the output @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 maps from the simulation .",
    "figure [ bandpass_syserr ] shows the predicted signal at k band .",
    "we treat this as an angular template and compute the least - squares fit of the _ wmap _ data to this bandpass template to determine the amplitude of the effect in the observed correlation functions .",
    "we correct the _ wmap _ correlation functions @xmath42 and @xmath50 at k and ka bands by subtracting the best - fit template amplitudes .",
    "the fitted signal has peak amplitude of 8 @xmath51k@xmath52 at 23 ghz and 5 @xmath51k@xmath52 at 33 ghz .",
    "no other channel has a statistically significant detection of this effect .",
    "sidelobe pickup of polarized emission from the galactic plane can also produce spurious polarization at high latitudes in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps .",
    "we estimate this effect using the measured far - sidelobe response for each beam in each polarization @xcite . the simplest approach would be to estimate the signal in each time - ordered sample , convolving the full sky sidelobe response with the stokes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 maps given the instantaneous orientation of the beams for each sample .",
    "such an approach is computationally expensive .",
    "we instead approximate the signal in each pixel by convolving the full sky sidelobe response with the one - year @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps . for each pixel",
    ", we fix one beam on that pixel while sweeping the other beam through all orientations achieved in flight . the average from the convolution yields the sidelobe contribution for the pixel in question .",
    "details of the sidelobe maps are presented in @xcite .",
    "we correlate the sidelobe maps with the temperature anisotropy maps in each channel to estimate the systematic error in the temperature - polarization correlation .",
    "sidelobe pickup of polarized structure in the galactic plane is less than 1 @xmath51k@xmath52 in @xmath42 at 23 ghz and below 0.1 @xmath51k@xmath52 in all other bands .",
    "the effect of bandpass mismatch in the far sidelobes ( as opposed to the main beam ) is similarly weak , with limits 1.3 @xmath51k@xmath52 at 23 ghz and less than 0.05 @xmath51k@xmath52 in all other bands .",
    "we correct the polarization maps for the estimated sidelobe signal and propagate the associated systematic uncertainty throughout our analysis .",
    "note that all of these systematic errors depend on the galactic foregrounds , and have different frequency dependence than cmb polarization .",
    "other instrumental effects are negligible .",
    "we measure polarization by differencing the outputs of the two radiometers in each differencing assembly ( eq . [ diff_def ] ) .",
    "calibration errors ( as opposed to the bandpass effect discussed above ) can alias temperature anisotropy into a spurious polarization signal .",
    "we have simulated the uncertainty in the calibration solution using both realistic gain drifts and drifts ten times larger than observed in flight @xcite .",
    "gain drifts ( either intrinsic or thermally - induced ) contribute less than 1 @xmath51k@xmath52 to @xmath42 in the worst band .",
    "null tests provide an additional check for systematic errors .",
    "thomson scattering of scalar temperature anisotropy produces a curl - free polarization pattern .",
    "a non - zero cosmological signal is thus expected only for the iq ( te ) correlation , whereas systematic errors or foreground sources can affect both the iq and iu ( tb ) correlations . we also test linear combinations of radiometer maps which cancel the polarization signal but which test for systematic effects .",
    "we compute the iq and iu correlation functions by correlating the stokes @xmath0 sum map from the q- or v - band ( as noted above ) with the polarization _ difference _ maps @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "we then co - add the results with their noise weights , and compare the co - added result for the polarization difference maps to a similar computation for the polarization sum maps .",
    "the temperature ( stokes @xmath0 ) map in all cases is a sum map ; the test is thus primarily sensitive to systematic errors in the polarization data .",
    "table [ sum_diff_chi_table ] shows results of the null tests .",
    "we compare @xmath42 and @xmath50 for the sum and difference maps to a null hypothesis that the data consist of stokes @xmath0 and instrument noise , with no polarization in the stokes @xmath1 or @xmath2 maps .",
    "we break the data into 2 angular regimes to differentiate between signals at decoupling vs reionization .",
    "we find a clear signal detection for @xmath42 in the sum map for both angular scales .",
    "all other tests are consistent with instrument noise  there is no evidence for additional systematic errors in the temperature - polarization cross - correlation .",
    "galactic emission is not a strong contaminant for cmb temperature anisotropy , but could be significant in polarization .",
    "_ wmap _ measurements of unpolarized foreground emission show synchrotron , free - free , and thermal dust emission all sharing significant spatial structure @xcite . of these components , only synchrotron emission is expected to generate significant polarization ; other sources such as spinning dust are limited to less than 5% of the total intensity at 33 ghz .",
    "synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated in the galactic magnetic field is the dominant unpolarized foreground at frequencies below @xmath5750 ghz .",
    "although it is known to be linearly polarized , previous radio surveys provide little guidance for the high - latitude polarization at mm wavelengths .",
    "extrapolation of radio polarization maps @xcite to millimeter wavelengths indicate a polarization fraction between 10% and 50% depending on galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "the unpolarized component has angular power spectrum @xmath58 , while the cmb power spectrum rises to a set of peaks on angular scales @xmath59 ( _ cf _ fig 10(b ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the angular dependence of the _ polarized _ foreground component is expected to be even steeper @xcite , suggesting that foreground polarization is most likely to affect temperature - polarization correlations on large angular scales .",
    "radio maps at low galactic latitude , however , demonstrate that the polarization intensity is not necessarily well correlated with the unpolarized intensity , complicating template analysis for temperature - polarization cross - correlations @xcite .",
    "we thus use the frequency dependence of the measured temperature - polarization cross - correlation to separate cosmic from foreground signals .",
    "foreground polarization above 40 ghz is faint : fitting the correlation functions at 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ( q , v , and w bands ) to a single power - law @xmath60 yields spectral index @xmath61 , consistent with a cmb signal ( @xmath62 ) and inconsistent with the spectral indices expected for synchrotron ( @xmath63 ) , spinning dust ( @xmath64 ) , or thermal dust ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the measured signal can not be produced solely by a single foreground emission component ( unless the fractional polarization of the foreground emission has a compensating frequency dependence , which seems unlikely ) .    a two - component fit @xmath66 tests for the superposition of a cmb component with a single foreground component .",

    "we obtain a marginal detection of foreground component with best - fit spectral index @xmath67 consistent with synchrotron emission .",

    "[ iq_def ] with either the _ wmap _ maximum - entropy foreground model @xcite or a `` residual '' foreground map created by subtracting the internal linear combination cmb map from the individual _ wmap _ temperature maps .",
    "we then correlate the foreground temperature map against the _ wmap _ polarization data in each frequency band , and fit the resulting correlation functions to cmb and foreground components ( eq . [ gal_fit_eqn ] ) .",

    "systematic errors have a negligible effect on the fitted optical depth ; altering the systematic error corrections changes the best - fit values of @xmath110 by less than 0.01 .",
    "the largest non - random uncertainty is the foreground separation .",
    "we assess the uncertainty in the foreground separation by repeating the entire systematic error analysis ( using both standard and altered systematic error corrections ) with the foreground spectral index @xmath67 shifted one standard deviation up or down from the best - fit value . table [",

    "data at 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ( q , v , and w bands ) where foregrounds are negligible show similar values for @xmath110 ; the @xmath115 for 57 degrees of freedom indicates that the data are in agreement with reionized models .",
    "adding additional low - frequency channels reduces the formal statistical uncertainty , but introduces non - zero foreground contamination as shown by the marked increase in @xmath92 .",
    "the next three sets of rows show the results when the data are separated into cmb and foreground components ( eq . [ gal_fit_eqn ] ) .",
    "all data combinations are now in agreement ; we obtain nearly identical values for @xmath110 when fitting either the highest - frequency data set qvw or the lowest - frequency set kkaq .",
    "the fitted optical depth is insensitive to the spectral index : varying the spectral index from -2.9 to -4.5 changes the fitted values by 0.02 or less .",
    "we adopt @xmath8 as the best estimate for the optical depth to reionization , where the error bar reflects a 68% confidence level interval including statistical , systematic , and foreground uncertainties .",

    "the larger uncertainty reflects the effect of simultaneously fitting multiple parameters .",
    "the te analysis propagates foreground uncertainties by re - evaluating the likelihood using different foreground spectral index . since foreground affect only the lowest multipoles , the combined analysis propagates foreground uncertainty by doubling the statistical uncertainty in @xmath71 for @xmath117 to account for this effect .",
    "an alternative approach avoids assuming any cosmological model and uses the measured temperature angular correlation function to determine the radiation power spectrum at recombination .",
    "this approach assumes that the best estimate of the three dimensional radiation power spectrum is the _ measured _ angular power spectrum rather than a model fit to the angular power spectrum .",
    "given the observed temperature power spectrum @xmath76 , we derive the predicted polarization cross - power spectrum @xmath71 (  [ section : template ] ) , which we then fit to the observed te spectrum as a function of optical depth @xmath110 .",
    "we obtain @xmath118 , in excellent agreement with the value derived assuming a @xmath7cdm cosmology .",
    "we emphasize that the model - independent technique makes _ no _ assumptions about the cosmology .",
    "the fact that it agrees well with the best - fit model from the combined temperature and polarization data @xcite is an additional indication that the observed temperature - polarization correlations on large angular scales represent the imprint of physical conditions at reionization .",
    "the dependence on the underlying cosmology is small .",
    "reionization can also be expressed as a redshift @xmath119 assuming an ionization history .",
    "we consider two simple cases . for instantaneous reionization with ionization fraction @xmath120 at @xmath121 , the measured optical depth corresponds to redshift @xmath122 .",
    "this conflicts with measurements of the gunn - peterson absorption trough in spectra of distant quasars , which show neutral hydrogen present at @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "reionization clearly did not occur through a single rapid phase transition .",
    "however , since absorption spectra are sensitive to even small amounts of neutral hydrogen , models with partial ionization @xmath124 can have enough neutral column density to produce the gunn - peterson trough while still providing free electrons to scatter cmb photons and produce large - scale polarization .",
    "direct gunn - peterson observations only imply a neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath125 1% @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we modify the simplest model to add a second transition : a jump from @xmath126 to @xmath127 at redshift @xmath119 , followed by a second transition from @xmath127 to @xmath128 at redshift @xmath129 . fitting this model to the measured optical depth yields @xmath130 . in reality , reionization is more complicated than simple step transitions .",
    "allowing for model uncertainty , the measured optical depth is consistent with reionization at redshift @xmath6 , corresponding to times @xmath131 myr after the big bang ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "extrapolations of the observed ionizing flux to higher redshift lead to predicted cmb optical depth between @xmath132 @xcite , lower than our best fit values .",
    "the measured optical depth thus implies additional sources of ionizing flux at high redshift .",
    "an early generation of very massive ( pop iii ) stars could provide the required additional heating .",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath133 of all baryons should be in collapsed objects by @xmath134 .",
    "if these baryons form massive stars , they would reionize the universe .",
    "however , photons below the hydrogen ionization threshold will destroy molecular hydrogen ( the principal vehicle for cooling in early stars ) , driving the effective mass threshold for star formation to @xmath135 solar masses and impeding subsequent star formation @xcite .",
    "x - ray heating and ionization @xcite may provide a loophole to this argument by enhancing the formation of @xmath136 molecules @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides a physically - motivated model of `` double reionization '' that resembles the two - step model above .",
    "a first generation of massive pop iii stars initially ionizes the intergalactic medium .",
    "the increased metallicity of the intergalactic medium then produces a transition to smaller pop ii stars , after which the reduced ionizing flux allows regeneration of a neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "the ionization fraction remains at @xmath137 until the global star formation rate surpasses the recombination rate at @xmath138 , restoring @xmath128 .",
    "the predicted value @xmath139 should be increased somewhat to reflect the higher _ wmap _ values for the baryon density @xmath140 and normalization @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "the contribution from ionized helium will also serve to increase @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "determination of the optical depth indicates that ionization history must be more complicated than a simple instantaneous step function .",
    "while physically plausible models can reproduce the observed optical depth , reionization remains a complex process and can not be fully characterized by a single number .",
    "a more complete determination of the ionization history requires evaluation of the detailed @xmath142 and @xmath143 power spectra @xcite .",
    "_ wmap _ detects statistically significant correlations between the temperature and polarization maps .",
    "the correlations are inconsistent with instrument noise and are significantly larger than the upper limits established for potential systematic errors .",
    "the correlations are present in all _ wmap _ frequency bands with similar amplitude from 23 to 94 ghz ; fitting the data to a single power - law in frequency yields a spectral index @xmath61 , consistent with a cmb signal ( @xmath62 ) and inconsistent with the measured spectral indices for galactic foreground emission .",
    "a two - component fit to a superposition of cmb and galactic foregrounds yields a positive foreground detection in both curl- and curl - free modes , with best - fit spectral index @xmath67 consistent with synchrotron emission of amplitude @xmath144 antenna temperature at 41 ghz .",
