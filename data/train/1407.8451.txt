    "exciton - polaritons are matter - light quasiparticles that arise from the coupling between excitons and photon modes in a semiconductor microcavity and can form bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) at relatively high temperatures @xcite .",

    "their wavefunctions produce a rich variety of localised quantum states in the micrometer scale : dark solitons @xcite , bright solitons @xcite , vortices @xcite .",
    "solitons in polaritonic condensates have potential for applications in ultrafast information processing @xcite due to picosecond response times and strong nonlinearities @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report a frequency band of dark polariton solitons whose exciton wave function develops a discontinuity as the frequency is increased beyond the exciton frequency ( fig .",

    "the photon field vanishes while the exciton field experiences a half - cycle phase jump .",
    "we investigate a one - dimensional condensate of polaritons in a strongly - coupled exciton and photon system .",
    "our derivation depends crucially on the use of the classic model that retains separate wave functions for the excitons and the photon modes .",
    "exciton interactions are modelled by a nonlinear term , while photons are dispersive . neglecting both pumping and losses ( which are due to radiation and thermalization ) and thus focusing on the synergy of exciton interaction ( nonlinearity ) and photon dispersion allows us to produce analytical formulae for polariton solitons .",
    "conservative solitonic structures of half - light and half - matter have been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "the solitons we derive apply for a short time after the pumping is removed and the losses have not seriously manifested themselves or the solitons lie outside the pump spot . for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite quasi - one - dimensional structures are observed outside the pump spots . in a different realization ,",
    "polariton condensates can be created at two pump spots @xcite and localised structures can be sustained in the region between the two spots where there is no pumping .",

    "we focus on continuous and discontinuous dark solitons for @xmath20 .",
    "for a dark soliton @xmath36 to exist , the cubic polynomial @xmath37 must have a double root that serves as the soliton s far - field value .",
    "the value of the constant of integration @xmath34 that provides such a nonzero double root equals @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a convenient dimensionless parameter @xmath40 we calculate the double root to be equal to @xmath41 , given in  . the fact that this is also the value of the far - field justifies the notation .",

    "a dark soliton appears at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) corresponding to a _ threshold frequency _ @xmath57 .",
    "this constitutes the linear limit of the soliton that emerges as the frequency increases ; it is thus no surprise that the frequency @xmath57 coincides with the lower endpoint of the well - known lower band @xmath58 of homogeneous linear @xmath59 polaritons of the form @xmath60 , with @xmath29 and @xmath28 constant  @xcite . as the frequency",

    "the vanishing of the photon field turns off the coupling between neighboring excitons thus making the jump permissible .",

    "the jump discontinuity of the exciton envelope profile sets on as @xmath39 becomes negative .    adopting the slope of the profile at the origin @xmath43 as an indicator of the scale of the slope of the profile",
    "we define the _ healing length _ of a exciton field profile by @xmath83 with a similar equation for the photon field . from the field envelope eq .  , and the far - field eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath84 and @xmath85 . thus , the healing lengths @xmath86 and @xmath87 are related  by @xmath88 combining eqs .  , and @xmath89 , we obtain for the continuous soliton the healing lengths @xmath90    when @xmath91 , near the blow - up frequency @xmath92 the healing length of the excitons approaches zero , while the photon healing length diverges to infinity . at the same time the far - field value goes to infinity . at the transition frequency @xmath93 (",

    "we solve eq . for @xmath96 as a power series in @xmath28 up to the third degree term and we insert this value of @xmath96 into eq . .",
    "there seems to be no analogous way to derive a gp equation for the exciton field .",
