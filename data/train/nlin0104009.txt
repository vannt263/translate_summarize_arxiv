    "recently it was proposed by kottos and smilansky @xcite that quantum graphs can serve as a good `` toy '' model for quantum chaos .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed that for some classes of graphs , including the fully connected graphs , the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite holds true . by this",
    "we mean that various statistical functions of the spectrum of the graphs converge to the corresponding functions obtained in random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite in the limit as the number of vertices is taken to infinity .",
    "on the graphs , the quantum evolution operator assumes the form of a finite unitary matrix @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the classical counterpart of the quantum system is the markov chain on the directed bonds of the graph with the matrix @xmath1 of the transition probabilities given by @xmath3 it was conjectured that there is a link between ergodicity of the markov chain and the convergence of the quantum statistics to rmt results .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that the statistics for a special family of graphs , the quantum star graphs , converge to a non - rmt limit as the size of the graphs increases .",
    "however `` classically '' the star graphs have nice properties : the corresponding markov chain possesses a unique attracting equilibrium distribution which corresponds to the eigenvalue 1 of @xmath1 .",
    "thus ergodicity of each graph does _ not _ immediately imply rmt - like behaviour .",
    "it is well - known that a good quantitative measure of ergodicity of a markov chain is its spectral gap . given the spectrum @xmath4 of @xmath1 , the spectral gap is defined as @xmath5 the spectral gap indicates the speed of convergence of any initial distribution to the equilibrium one : the greater @xmath6 is , the faster is the convergence .",
    "tanner @xcite suggested that if for a sequence of graphs the spectral gap of the corresponding markov chains is uniformly bounded away from zero , then the spectral statistics will converge to their rmt form .",
    "this seems to be a good indicator of the conformance to rmt : while for each star graph the gap is non - zero , it decreases to zero as we increase the size of the graph .",
    "and in the numerically verified cases of rmt - like behaviour the gap stays bounded away from zero .    to investigate the connection between random unitary matrices and the ergodicity of their `` classical '' analogues , we ask the following question : given a large random unitary matrix , find the probability distribution of the spectral gap of the corresponding markov chain",
    "since the most natural ensemble of the unitary matrices is the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) , we shall restrict our attention to it , although the generalisation of the problem to other ensembles is straightforward .",
    "cue@xmath7 is defined as the ensemble of all unitary @xmath8 matrices endowed with the probability measure that is invariant under every automorphism @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are any two @xmath8 unitary matrices .",
    "an entrywise nonnegative @xmath8 matrix @xmath1 is called _ doubly stochastic _ if @xmath12 the set of all such @xmath8 matrices we denote by ds@xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath0 is unitary then the matrix @xmath1 defined by ( [ eq : trans_prob ] ) is doubly stochastic . for a markov chain",
    "it means that the uniform measure is invariant , that is @xmath13 is a left eigenvector of @xmath1 with the eigenvalue 1 .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath14 then @xmath15 , thus ds@xmath7 forms a semigroup .",
    "now we define the function @xmath16 to map @xmath0 to @xmath1 according to  ( [ eq : trans_prob ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath17 induces a probability measure on the semigroup ds@xmath7 .",
    "thus our question is    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what is the probability distribution of the spectral gap @xmath6 if the matrices @xmath18 are selected randomly with the probability induced by the correspondence @xmath17 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we denote the gap probability density function by @xmath19 and the corresponding cumulative distribution by @xmath20 . for convenience",
    "we also denote by @xmath21 the second largest ( by modulus ) eigenvalue of the doubly stochastic matrix @xmath1 , @xmath22 and , as a consequence , @xmath23 .",
    "first of all we are going to present the results of some numerical simulations . the algorithm we used is simple : random matrices from cue@xmath7 are generated using the hurwitz parametrisation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the spectrum of the corresponding doubly stochastic matrix @xmath18 is computed and the gap is calculated according to the definition  ( [ eq : gap_defn ] ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution functions obtained for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 for sample sizes of @xmath31 are shown on . from the plot",
    "we can see that the typical gap tends to 1 as we increase @xmath2 .",
    "thus it is natural to conjecture that the gap probability density function @xmath19 converges to @xmath32 in the sense of distributions as @xmath33 or , in other words , @xmath34    further evidence in support of this guess is presented by , where the mean @xmath35 and the standard deviation @xmath36 of the second largest eigenvalue are plotted as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "a good fit to the mean is given by @xmath37 ( which is supported by heuristic observations presented in section  [ sec : verify ] ) .",
    "note that since @xmath38 and @xmath39 to verify ( [ eq : prob_decay ] ) it is enough to show that @xmath40 as @xmath33 .",
    "in the case of @xmath24 it is easy to calculate the gap probability explicitly . for completeness",
    "we include the derivation although it is obvious from that the distribution for @xmath24 is not typical .",
    "a @xmath41 unitary matrix can be parametrized as @xmath42 with @xmath43 the haar ( uniform ) measure on the cue(2 ) can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding doubly stochastic matrix is @xmath49 with eigenvalues 1 and @xmath50 .",
    "thus the gap is equal to @xmath51 and its distribution is uniform on the interval @xmath52 $ ] ( which agrees with ) .",
    "let @xmath21 be the second largest ( by modulus ) eigenvalue of the random doubly stochastic matrix @xmath1 drawn from @xmath53 with the probability induced by the correspondence @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 as a consequence , the gap distribution @xmath19 converges to @xmath32 in the sense of distributions as @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath56 are , in general , complex",
    ". it would be more convenient to deal with nonnegative real eigenvalues .",
    "the trick is to consider the matrix @xmath57 which , due to the semigroup property is also doubly stochastic . in addition , it is symmetric ( all eigenvalues are real ) and positive definite ( i.e. all eigenvalues are nonnegative ) . to relate the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath58 and @xmath1",
    "we write for the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the eigenvector of both @xmath58 and @xmath1 with the eigenvalue 1 , and @xmath61 is the eigenvector of @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath21 . from ( [ eq : evalsam ] ) and the inequality @xmath62 we infer that to prove the theorem it is enough to show that the mean of @xmath63 converges to zero as @xmath33 .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath58 is to compute its trace .",
    "since @xmath58 is positively defined , we have @xmath64 thus if we can find such @xmath65 that @xmath66 , it will imply that @xmath67 .",
    "it turns out that it is enough to take @xmath68 .",
    "however let us consider @xmath69 too . @xmath70 and calculating the mean @xmath71 where due to the invariance of measure of cue@xmath7 the means of the different matrix elements are equal . to calculate",
    "@xmath72 one can either integrate over the measure of cue@xmath7 , as was done in @xcite , or apply various invariance considerations @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath73 and therefore @xmath74 as @xmath33 .",
    "this agrees with the numerical observation that @xmath75 : the eigenvalues of @xmath58 are then of order @xmath76 and there are @xmath77 of them ( not counting the 1 ) .    in the case @xmath68 we have @xmath78 applying the averaging we again find that due to the invariance of the measure all contributions from the first sum are the same and there are @xmath79 of them ; there are @xmath80 contributions from the second and the third sum ( the contributions are equal ) and @xmath81 contributions from the last . counting the number of terms in each sum , we write @xmath82 where the averages can be calculated using @xcite , @xmath83 bringing everything together , we obtain @xmath84 which effectively finishes the proof .",
    "it is now clear that the distributions @xmath86 have singular limit .",
    "the natural question to ask , then , is what is the shape of @xmath86 for finite , but large , @xmath2 and whether there are sequences of normalizing coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 such that the random variables @xmath89 have continuous limiting distribution .",
    "while we are unable to give a definite answer , we can make a guess . since @xmath90 , it is not unnatural to conjecture that for large @xmath2 the distribution of the second largest eigenvalue @xmath91 is well approximated by the generalized extreme value distribution ( gev ) @xcite , specified by its cumulative distribution function @xmath92^{-1/\\xi}\\right\\}},\\ ] ] for some ( @xmath2-dependent ) @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 : the gev distribution is used to model maxima of sequences of random variables .    to check our conjecture we fit the numerical data for @xmath96 to the form  ( [ eq : gev_def ] ) using an splus routine by coles @xcite",
    "the routine minimizes the log - likelihood function @xmath97^{1 + 1/\\xi } -      \\left[1+\\xi{\\left(\\frac{x - a}{b}\\right)}\\right]^{-1/\\xi}\\right\\}},\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the sequence of observations of @xmath91 .",
    "the result of the routine is plotted as the probability density function @xmath99 for fitted @xmath100 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 against the histogram of the numerical data for @xmath91 .",
    "one can see that the agreement is very good .",
    "the probability and quantile plots , which we do not present here , also show good agreement .",
    "as @xmath2 is taken to infinity , the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 decay to zero , so that the limit of the distribution is the step function , and @xmath93 saturates at a nonzero value .",
    "we have shown that if we take element - wise modulus squared of a large unitary matrix @xmath0 , the resulting doubly stochastic matrix @xmath1 will have large spectral gap : with high probability all @xmath77 `` free '' eigenvalues will have small modulus .",
    "in particular , it means that the markov chain corresponding to @xmath1 will quickly relax from any initial distribution into the uniform stationary state .",
    "while our observation is by no means a proof of tanner s @xcite conjecture that the families of graphs with large gap in their `` classical '' spectrum will adhere to rmt predictions , it is another powerful argument in its favour .",
    "we also note that the unitary evolution matrix of a general graph is sparse due to the topological restrictions @xcite .",
    "thus , although arbitrary @xmath0 can be considered as the scattering matrix for an @xmath2-star graph , the generalisation of the gap distribution to graphs with less trivial topology still remains to be studied .",
    "the results for the mean of the traces of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , obtained in the course of our proof , completely agree with the numerical observation that the mean gap increases with @xmath2 like @xmath103 .",
    "we also presented numerical evidence in favour of the claim that for finite @xmath2 the distribution of the second largest eigenvalue is well approximated by the generalized extreme value distribution .",
