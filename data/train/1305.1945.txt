    "this event triggered an immediate follow - up using _ swift _ s x - ray telescope ( xrt ) that localized a new point source at a position consistent with that of sgr a * @xcite .",

    "the pre - flare background rates were established using three recent  galactic survey observations acquired in 2012 july , august and october .",

    "the background spectrum was identical to what was used in the phase - averaged spectral analysis detailed above , and was corrected to account for the phase cuts .",
    "a consequence of such fine division is poor photon statistics above @xmath80 kev .",

    "we found a @xmath82 variation in @xmath67 while the blackbody flux normalization varied by @xmath83% .",
    "the _ swift_-observed magnetar - like burst , the detected spin period ( 3.76 s ) and the preliminary first derivative as measured by  and _ swift _ provide firm evidence that  is a new magnetar in outburst .",
    "has shown no significant flux variation over @xmath80 days since the burst was detected on 2013 april 24 @xcite . in archival data ,",
    "there is no x - ray counterpart at the _ chandra _  position of .",
    "this sets an upper limit on the quiescent @xmath84 kev luminosity of @xmath85  erg  s@xmath5 @xcite while the bursting @xmath84 kev luminosity of  reached @xmath86  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "comparable dynamic ranges have been seen in other magnetars , including 1e  1547@xmath875408 @xcite and swift j1822.3@xmath871606 ( e.g. @xcite ) ; such sources have been dubbed `` transient '' ( e.g. @xcite ) to distinguish them from the `` classical '' magnetars with high quiescent luminosities ( see @xcite and references therein ) . with its detection at radio wavelengths",
    "@xcite ,  is similar to the transient magnetars 1e 1547@xmath875408 @xcite , j1622@xmath874950 @xcite and xte j1810@xmath87197 @xcite , the only three radio - detected magnetars . that all radio - detected magnetars are transients in spite of deep radio searches of classical magnetars @xcite suggests the radio emission may be associated only with the transients .",
    "the lack of a quiescent _ chandra _",
    "counterpart indicates that  has a quiescent temperature of @xmath88 0.3 kev , assuming that the source is at the galactic center ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "this is comparable to the quiescent temperature of the transient magnetar xte j1810@xmath87197 @xcite , and , interestingly , to the blackbody temperatures of a growing number of high - magnetic - field radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "this fact , and the detection of a magnetar - like outburst from one high - b pulsar @xcite , suggests that all high - b radio pulsars may be magnetars in quiescence , consistent with models of magnetothermal evolution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . the hard x - ray power - law component with slope",
    "@xmath89 is similar to what has been observed for other magnetars at high energies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is suggested to be generated by an electron - positron flow in a closed twisted bundle of magnetic field lines @xcite . in this model",
    ", the flow is sustained through @xmath90 discharge at voltage @xmath91  v , and energy is released with rate @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the electric current circulating in the twisted bundle . if the bundle is near the magnetic dipole axis and emerges from a polar cap of area @xmath94 , its magnetic flux is @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 is the surface magnetic field and @xmath97  @xmath77 ) , and it generates luminosity @xmath98  erg  s@xmath5 where @xmath99 g @xmath100 is the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the measured @xmath18 gives @xmath101  g  @xmath100 , and one finds that the observed luminosity @xmath102 corresponds to @xmath103  @xmath77 , which is close to the emission area of the thermal component of the  spectrum .",
    "thus , the thermal emission can be associated with the footpoint of the twisted bundle .",
    "it is bombarded by the relativistic particles from the @xmath90 discharge , and a fraction of power @xmath102 released in the bundle is radiated in a quasi - thermal form at the footpoint , whose temperature may be estimated from @xmath104 .",
    "this gives @xmath105  kev , consistent with the observed thermal component .",
    "additional heat diffusion from the deeper crust could also contribute to the spot emission @xcite , although the available data do not yet require this .",
    "the expected decay time of the magnetospheric luminosity is given by @xmath106  s ( beloborodov 2009 ) .",
    "is predicted in this model to show a decay time of @xmath107  s , which is similar to that observed in xte j1810 - 197 .",
    "additional monitoring with _ swift _  can confirm our model prediction on the flux evolution @xcite .    in spite of the angular proximity of sgr a * to the magnetar and the possibility that the latter is in the galactic center , we would not expect measurable bias in the spin - down rate due to orbital acceleration unless the orbit were very eccentric and the orbital phase highly fortuitous , and/or the currently measured spin - down rate were temporarily much larger than the intrinsic value . additionally , if at the galactic center , the magnetar is @xmath108 outside a disk with mean eccentricity @xmath109 @xcite of clockwise rotating , predominantly massive o - type and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars with disk age @xmath110 myr @xcite .",
    "it would not be surprising that the magnetar would stay well localized if it were born in the disk .",
    "the disk escape velocity is @xmath111 km  s@xmath5 , much larger than measured magnetar velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , depending on the precise details of initial eccentricity and orbital phase , a kick velocity @xmath112 km  s@xmath5 could move the magnetar out of the disk and into an even more elliptical , bound orbit .",
    "we need not , however , specify the argument to the disk .",
    "approximately 50% of the o / wr stars , also of age @xmath110 myr , reside on extended , isotropic orbits outside the disk , and the magnetar would be similarly bound in that case .",
    "there are other stars in this region .",
    "b - stars have a density  3 - 4 times lower than the early - type stars though .",
    "the density of much less massive late type stars is @xmath192 times higher .",
    "thus plausibly associating the magnetar with the early - type stars , as has been previously suggested @xcite , would imply a progenitor mass @xmath113 , based on the age of all the early - type stars in this region , and evolutionary models .",
    "we report the  discovery of a new magnetar known as .",
    "the detection of spin period and its first derivative confirms that  is a transient magnetar previously undetected .",
    "is the fourth of a growing subclass of magnetars detected in the radio band .",
    "it indicates that many magnetars in quiescence remain undetected in the x - ray band or they have been detected as high - b radio pulsars .",
    "further monitoring of  by x - ray and radio telescopes will reveal the time evolution of the spectral and timing properties , thus constraining the outburst emission mechanism of transient magnetars .",
    "this discovery of a magnetar near sgr a * has important implications for the dynamics , progenitor masses and formation of neutron stars in the vicinity of the galactic center , and these issues will be addressed in our follow - up paper .",
