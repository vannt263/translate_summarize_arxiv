    "the astro - spas is a free flying platform that is designed to operate autonomously in the vicinity ( up to 60 km ) of the space shuttle for a limited period of up to 14 days .",
    "it was designed by the daimler - benz aerospace ag ( dasa ) in ottobrunn , germany .    with a mission duration of 17.7 days",
    "sts-80 was the longest shuttle flight to date , the free flying time of orfeus - spas was 14 days .",
    "orfeus - spas was released a few hours after launch on 20 november , 1996 .",
    "it was the third flight of the reusable astro - spas platform and the second flight of the orfeus - spas configuration .    the orfeus telescope ( * o*rbiting and * r*etrievable * f*ar and * e*xtreme * u*ltraviolet * s*pectrometer ) ( krmer et al .",

    "the berkeley spectrograph was developed by the space sciences laboratory of the university of california at berkeley ( hurwitz & bowyer @xcite , @xcite , hurwitz et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the echelle spectrograph was developed by the university of tbingen and the landessternwarte heidelberg ( appenzeller et al .",

    ", the interstellar matter absorption profile spectrometer ( imaps ) was attached to the astro - spas ( jenkins et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the orfeus telescope and the echelle spectrometer were designed and built by kayser - threde gmbh in munich , germany .",
    "the echelle detector as well as the echelle electronics and the echelle onboard processor were designed and built by the institute for astronomy and astrophysics , department astronomy , of the university of tbingen .",
    "the orfeus - spas total instrument operation time was 2630 , while the net integration time was 1649 , resulting in an efficiency of 62.5% for all instruments .",
    "this is an extremely high value as compared to other satellite missions .",
    "50% of the total integration time were reserved for guest investigators selected by peer review .",
    "the other 50% were used by the principal investigator teams who had provided the instruments .",
    "65 distinct objects were observed with the echelle spectrometer .    in this paper",
    "we present the performance figures for the echelle spectrometer and a short description of the principles of the data extraction procedure .",
    "within the orfeus telescope a movable mirror is used to switch between the two spectrometers .",
    "we will restrict the instrument description to the echelle spectrometer .",
    "the movable mirror is designed to act at the same time as an off - axis parabolic collimator ( cm , fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . when moved in",
    "it feeds the echelle grating ( eg ) with a parallel light bundle .",
    "when the collimator mirror is moved out , the beam is falling directly into the berkeley spectrometer .",
    "the echelle grating has a groove density of 316 lines / mm with a blaze angle of 625 .",
    "it is operated in the diffraction orders 40 to 61 covering the wavelength range from 90 nm to 140 nm .",
    "the echelle diffraction orders are separated by means of a spherical cross disperser grating ( cd ) with 1200 lines / mm which also serves as the spectrograph camera .",
    "this design minimizes the number of reflections , which , in view of the low reflectivities in the fuv ( ranging from 10% to 30% ) , was of critical importance for achieving an acceptable overall efficiency .",
    "the spectrum is recorded by the echelle detector ( ed ) , which has a plane surface and a sensitive area of 40mm@xmath440 mm .",
    "the echelle spectrometer is designed to achieve a spectral resolution of @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=10000 when used with an entrance aperture of 10 diameter ( appenzeller et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      the echelle detector is a photon counting microchannel plate detector with a wedge and strip readout system .",
    "three stacked microchannel plates ( mcps ) , operated in a z - configuration , provide a gain of 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 electrons / photon .",
    "each of the three mcps has its own power supply and an accelerating voltage is applied to the gaps between the mcps . during flight the gain of the echelle detector was monitored and could be controlled by variation of the high voltage of the third mcp",
    ". the high voltage could be adjusted by commands during flight or by starting an automatic function that adjusted the high voltage so that a predefined gain value was achieved .    a repeller grid in front of the mcps produces an electric field of about 50v / mm , which is used to force those photo electrons back into the mcp channels , which are released from the areas in between the channels .",
    "this improves the quantum efficiency by about 30% but also causes a loss of 10% due to the shading by the repeller grid .    a four electrode wedge - and - strip anode ( martin et al .",
    "@xcite ) was used as readout system for the mcp detector .",
    "a special design allowed for a significant reduction of the edge distortions , which are basically unavoidable .",
    "further , by oversizing the active area of the anode to 44mm@xmath444 mm , it was possible to avoid any distortions within the sensitive area of the detector .",
    "the image format of the detector is 1024 pixels by 512 pixels , which corresponds to the active area of the anode .",
    "the detector sends for each photon event x / y - coordinates to the echelle onboard processor where these events are integrated onto an image memory .",
    "the content of this image memory is stored on magnetic tape at the end of each observation .    in parallel ,",
    "the x / y - coordinates for each single photon event are stored on tape directly , thus keeping also the photon arrival time to an accuracy of better than 1 second .",
    "this method is limited by the astro - spas interface to an event rate of less than 3500 counts / s , whereas the onboard integration works with much higher photon rates up to 30000 counts / s .",
    "the electronic dead time is about 13@xmath7s per event .",
    "the count rate of the echelle detector is monitored online and also stored on tape together with many other housekeeping data .",
    "this count rate is derived from all events registered by the charge amplifiers falling above the lower threshold of the detector electronics .",
    "not all of these events are finally integrated into the image for the following reasons :    * an upper electronic threshold suppresses pulses too large to be processed by the position decoding electronics .",
    "* at high count rates the dead time of 13@xmath7s for position decoding reduces the rate of registered events accordingly .",
    "* dead time effects from the interface electronics and from the onboard processor further reduce the electronic efficiency .",
    "these effects are the cause that in general the rate of the integrated counts within an image is between 15% and 25% lower than the count rate of the lower electronic threshold .    in the main dispersion direction",
    "somewhat more than 3 pixels correspond to one optical resolution element of @xmath1@xmath0=@xmath0/10000 ( 161@xmath7 m ) .",
    "the electronic resolution was estimated to be about 1.5 detector pixels fwhm .",
    "so the electronic detector resolution is sufficient to maintain the optical resolution of the echelle spectrometer .",
    "electronic test pulses were fed onto the anode with a frequency of 10hz at two different detector positions and with 3 different pulse heights .",
    "these test pulses were extremely useful during the checkout of the instrument and provide a means of monitoring the electronic performance of the detector throughout the mission .",
    "the extraction of the echelle spectra from the echelle detector images in x - direction ( main dispersion direction ) is done by summing up 11 pixels ( orders 40 to 49 ) or 9 pixels ( orders 50 to 61 ) in y - direction .",
    "the center of the extraction in y - direction follows a straight line along each order , but is located on integer pixel numbers .",
    "some echelle images show tilted absorption lines within the strip of the echelle orders .",
    "the reason for this effect is still unclear . in such cases",
    "the extraction was done summing up the pixels tilted by 45 degrees , which results in a significant increase in resolution .",
    "however an additional wavelength error was introduced by this procedure since the observed wavelength in this way became dependent on the centering of the echelle order within the extraction strip .",
    "this is a nonlinearity error of the size of one pixel , which corresponds to 1/3 of the optical resolution element and is equal to @xmath1@xmath0=@xmath0/30000 .      between the echelle orders",
    "a 3 pixel wide area was used to estimate the background . with exception of orders 40 , 41 and 42",
    "the background was calculated as average of the strip above and below the corresponding order .",
    "for the first three orders only the background values below each order were calculated .",
    "the so calculated background was smoothed prior to being used for subtraction .",
    "the intrinsic background of the detector was about 10@xmath8counts / s / pix .",
    "as 9 or 11 detector pixels are added to one spectral pixel , this corresponds to about 10@xmath9counts / s / pix in the extracted spectra , which is negligible .    by far",
    "the strongest contribution to the background is straylight from the echelle grating . the contribution in counts / detector - pixel is about 5% to 10% for the low echelle orders and",
    "10% to 20% for the high echelle orders as these are closer together .",
    "the percentage values refer to the maximum counts / detector - pixel values of the echelle orders .",
    "the contribution in counts / spectrum - pixel is about 15% for spectra with a rather flat continuum .",
    "the echelle straylight is scattered exactly horizontally across the detector , whereas the spectral orders run slightly tilted across the detector corresponding to the dispersion of the cross disperser .",
    "hence emission lines produce additional straylight while broad absorption lines lead to a reduced straylight contribution in a horizontal line at the y - position of this absorption line .",
    "these varying straylight contributions are not yet correctly handled by the background subtraction algorithm .",
    "an additional contribution is caused by particle events related to the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "these produced count rates of up to 1000 counts / s resulting in up to 2@xmath1010@xmath11 counts / s / pix on the detector and 2@xmath1010@xmath12 counts / s / pix in the spectra .",
    "the maximum duration of the passage through the saa was about 12min and the count rate curve showed a quasi gaussian shape during this time . in the case of weak targets where the saa background reduces the signal to noise ratio of the spectrum significantly , we are able to integrate the spectrum from the single photon records excluding the saa transit period .",
    "the efficiency of blazed echelle gratings varies as ( sin(x)/x)@xmath13 ( blaze function ) ( schroeder & hiliard @xcite ) , where x depends on the deviation of the output angle from the specular angle of maximum efficiency ( blaze angle ) and on the wavelength .",
    "the optimized diffraction direction was preflight adjusted to the y - centerline of the echelle detector . in the flight data we found the center of maximum efficiency to differ between the echelle orders and furthermore both the position and the width of the blaze function differing from observation to observation .",
    "therefore it was necessary to introduce an individual blaze correction for each observation .",
    "for spectra that showed a relatively undisturbed continuum the blaze correction could be done with a rather high accuracy .",
    "however for many spectra which are dominated by absorption lines only the overlap region between two adjacent orders could be used as a criterion for a good blaze correction , resulting in a less reliable correction .",
    "after completion of the blaze correction for all observations no systematic time dependent effects in the variation of the blaze function were found .      the wavelength calibration was calculated from the positions of 814 interstellar absorption lines in the echelle images of 12 different objects .",
    "the centers of the lines were determined by fitting gaussian functions to the profiles using a preliminary wavelength calibration .",
    "after identification of the lines a table with laboratory wavelengths and corresponding detector pixel numbers was created . using the preliminary wavelength calibration , a mean radial velocity component for each object",
    "was estimated and corrected for .",
    "this approach assumes , that for each individual object all identified interstellar absorption lines , mainly h@xmath14 and neutral elements , originate in the same volume of gas .    with a least square fit algorithm",
    "we then determined a new set of pixel to wavelength conversion parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the residuals for all lines demonstrate that the mean accuracy of the wavelength correspondence is better than @xmath30.005 nm , i.e. better than the optical resolution of the instrument .    the above procedure results in a relative wavelength calibration .",
    "in order to determine an absolute scale we used the position of the geocoronal ly-@xmath15 emission line as a reference .",
    "we found that for different observing blocks the position of the ly-@xmath15 line changed by up to 0.006 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this shift is still unclear , we assume that it emerges from temperature drifts of the telescope and the echelle spectrometer .",
    "a correction for this effect has been applied in each observing block .",
    "shifting of the echelle spectrum on the detector surface ( e.g. displacement of the target within the aperture ) basically results in a relative wavelength shift and thus in a radial velocity shift rather than in a wavelength shift .",
    "the reason is , that the wavelength dispersion is proportional to the wavelength .",
    "the wavelength scale of the targets were shifted to correct for radial velocity components due to the earth s movement ( heliocentric correction ) and due to the satellite s orbital movement .",
    "a further shift occurs when the target image is not exactly centered within the 20 diaphragm .",
    "the maximum resulting uncertainty due to the 10 radius of the diaphragm is @xmath31.2@xmath1010@xmath9 as a relative wavelength error ( corresponding to @xmath336km / s ) .",
    "this error was not corrected up to now .      in the corners of the detector area and at the left edge",
    "the efficiency of the repeller grid is reduced , probably due to an inhomogenous field close to the edge of the detector .",
    "a step occurs between lower and normal sensitivity . in some images",
    "a circularly shaped area is visible due to this effect .",
    "we estimated a loss of about 25% and corrected this by applying a `` smooth '' step function .",
    "the position , width and height of the step was estimated for each order from the sum of all echelle measurements .",
    "a detailed flat field correction was not applied , due to the fact , that the optical light path of the spectrometer can not be reproduced in our laboratory .",
    "this however would be essential for an exact estimation of the flat field behavior of the detector .",
    "any other correction methods are too uncertain to be useful .",
    "we used an hst archive model of g191b2b `` http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/calspec/g191b2b_mod_002.tab '' as a reference for the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the calibration was crosschecked with a model of ( r.napiwotzki , priv .",
    "we estimate an accuracy of @xmath310% for the flux calibration , provided the object was fully centered within the aperture , which was not always the case .",
    "the total efficiency of the echelle spectrometer was estimated before the flight by measuring the efficiencies of the individual optical components .",
    "the product of these values resulted in a maximum effective area of 2.4@xmath2 .    for postflight recalibration we used a hst calibration spectrum of .",
    "by comparing the fluxes within complete orders we estimated an effective area value for the central wavelength of each echelle order .",
    "values for echelle orders that were contaminated by strong absorption lines ( e.g. ly-@xmath15 ) were deleted from the data set .",
    "this procedure leads to a maximum effective area of 1.3@xmath2 near 110 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , which is based on all detector counts above the lower electronic threshold .",
    "the 20 diameter of the diaphragm should be sufficient to maintain the total flux of the object , as the jitter of the astro - spas was about @xmath32 .",
    "but we have indications that the telescope was not precisely focused during some periods of the mission , due to thermal problems during unexpected flight modes of the astro - spas .",
    "together with the fact that some objects were not fully centered this led to significant nonstatistical variations of the count rates , which resulted in a reduction of the flux and thus sensitivity .",
    "therefore the flux calibration was calculated for the maximum observed count rate for the corresponding target ( also from other observations of this target , if necessary ) .",
    "this count rate was scaled with the registered count rate in the integrated image .",
    "the spectrum of with a signal to noise ratio of 20 to 30 is best suited to study the spectral resolution of the echelle spectrograph .",
    "it shows many interstellar absorption lines , mainly from molecular hydrogen , which are very sharp and rather strong . among a total of 814 interstellar line positions used for wavelength calibration , 159 line positions originated from this object .",
    "we coadded two observations of this object with integration times of 1080s and 660s respectively , taken within two successive orbits ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we fitted many of these absorption lines in the wavelength range from 96 nm to 110 nm with gaussian profiles and calculated the ratio of wavelength to the fwhm of these lines .",
    "we got values mainly between @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=7000 to 10000 with depths of 60% to 80% ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and table1 ) .    [ cols= \" > , < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , > , < , < , > \" , ]     we further estimated an upper limit for the width of the instrument profile : assuming that the absorption lines had originally depths of 100% with the same equivalent width , we calculated the width of the instrument profile that would be necessary to reproduce the observed absorption line profiles . for simplicity we assumed gaussian profiles for both the absorption lines and the instrumental profile and a quadratic addition of the widths .",
    "the resulting values for the fwhm of the instrumental profiles are in the range @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=9000 to 13000 ( table1 ) .",
    "as these calculations are estimates of a lower limit of the resolution of the echelle spectrometer , we conclude that the achieved resolution of the echelle spectrometer was significantly better than the goal of @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=10000 .    another approach to estimate the achieved instrumental resolution",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the equivalent widths of the fitted absorption lines are plotted against their observed @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0 values .",
    "a linear least square fit is applied to all data points ( point no.9 was excluded from the fit in a conservative approach ) . extrapolating this fitted straight line to an equivalent width of 0",
    "should reproduce the instrumental resolution .",
    "the result is a value between @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=11000 and 12000 .",
    "this result is not really surprising , as the spectral resolution of 10000 was calculated for a fully illuminated 10 diaphragm .",
    "though the echelle spectrometer was operated with a 20 diaphragm the astro - spas pointing jitter was @xmath32 and therefore the effective object image size was much smaller than the assumed 10 .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the complete echelle spectrum of hd93521 smoothed with a 11 pixel wide boxcar .",
    "the individual echelle orders are plotted separately , the spectral range for each order is indicated at the top of the figure .",
    "the overlap region between adjacent orders increases with the order number .",
    "a small gap exists between orders 40 and 41 and between orders 41 and 42 .",
    "the echelle spectrometer was one of the two focal instruments of the orfeus telescope , which was flown on its second mission in november / december 1996 .",
    "the in - flight performance and the principles of data reduction for this instrument are presented .",
    "the wavelength range is 90 nm to 140 nm and we showed , that the spectral resolution is significantly better than @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath0=10000 , where @xmath1@xmath0 is measured as the fwhm of the instrumental profile .",
    "the effective area peaks at 1.3@xmath2 near 110 nm . the background is dominated by straylight from the echelle grating and is about 15% in an extracted spectrum for spectra with a rather flat continuum .",
    "the internal accuracy of the wavelength calibration is better than @xmath30.005 nm .",
