    "is dominated by its first constant term in ( [ rti ] ) , so that the condition ( [ bound0 ] ) can only be satisfied for @xmath163 if a = 0 .",
    "then , for @xmath164 , @xmath143 is dominated by its second term @xmath165 , leading to a perturbation @xmath166 which blows up as @xmath163 and violates ( [ bound ] ) unless [ rang ] k 3 .",
    "then we impose the condition of analyticity in @xmath126 at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "this is satisfied if [ unn ] k = 2n - 3/2 , where @xmath44 is a positive integer . combining eqs .",
    "( [ rang ] ) and ( [ unn ] ) we find that @xmath138 has only two positive eigenvalues k = 1/2 , k = 5/2 .",
    "however , in the above analysis we have disregarded the fact that @xmath167 is a double root of the secular equation ( [ sec ] ) .",
    "for @xmath167 the correct behavior of the general solution near @xmath152 is & & r(x ) ~a + b(-x ) + c(-x)|x| , + & & ( x ) ~- 2 - ^-1 4 - 4 - 4 |x| + & & ( x ) ~4 + ^-1 4 + 4 + 4 |x| , which satisfies the condition of analyticity only if @xmath168 .    at the ads boundary ( @xmath169 ) the leading behaviour of",
    "the background is , from eqs .",
    "( [ bound1 ] ) , [ cdfg ] ,  e^2 ( ) ,  _ 1 .",
    "we again assume a power - law behavior ~b|x^q ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "( [ pein2 ] ) , where @xmath144 can be neglected , gives q(q-1 ) = 2 , i.e. @xmath171 or @xmath172 .",
    "then , eq . ( [ pein1 ] ) reduces near @xmath173 to ",
    "- 2|x^-2 4b_1|x^q-3 .",
    "if @xmath171 , the behavior of the solution is governed by the right - hand side , i.e. @xmath174 , which violates the boundary condition ( [ bound ] ) for @xmath175 .",
    "so the behavior @xmath176 must be excluded , which fixes another integration constant @xmath177 ( where @xmath178 is a linear combination of @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .",
    "then , the generic behavior of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ asr ] ) with @xmath172 is governed by that for the homogeneous equation , i.e. r ~. this is consistent with the boundary condition ( [ bound ] ) , and is an admissible small perturbation if its amplitude is small enough , @xmath181 .    for @xmath167",
    ", we have seen that two of the three integration constants in ( [ rtii])-([ptii ] ) are fixed ( @xmath182 ) by condition ( [ bound0 ] ) and the analyticity condition , while the weak boundary condition at the ads boundary fixes a third constant @xmath177 .",
    "however this is impossible , as the perturbation amplitude must remain as a free parameter .",
    "so the mode @xmath167 can not satisfy all our boundary conditions , and we are left with a single eigenmode , k = 5/2 , completely determined up to an arbitrary amplitude by the two conditions @xmath183 .",
    "the corresponding perturbed metric function @xmath184 behaves near @xmath152 as r ( -u)^1/2[1 + x - ( -u)^-5/4bx ] . for @xmath185 , the central singularity @xmath23 is approximately given by ( -u)^1/4 -bv .",
    "our boundary conditions guarantee that it starts at @xmath186 ( as for the unperturbed solution ) and then becomes spacelike in the region @xmath187 .",
    "this singularity is hidden behind a trapping horizon ( defined by eq .",
    "( [ trap ] ) ) which , near @xmath152 , is null , ( -u)^5/4= ( a null trapping horizon was also found in @xcite ) .",
    "let us point out the crucial role played by the cosmological constant @xmath188 in the formation of this trapping horizon .",
    "for @xmath8 , @xmath189 , while , as discussed after eq .",
    "( [ pti ] ) , the perturbation @xmath143 with the boundary condition ( [ bound0 ] ) vanishes for @xmath8 , so that the perturbed radial function @xmath184 is ( as in @xcite ) identical to the css one , and the trapping horizon does not exist . near the ads boundary @xmath175 , it follows from ( [ cdfg ] ) and ( [ asol ] ) that both the central singularity and the trapping horizon are tangent to the null line ( -u)^5/4 = -e ( ) ^-1/2 .",
    "thus , perturbations of the quasi - css solution lead to black hole formation , showing that this solution is indeed a threshold solution , and is a candidate to describe critical collapse .",
    "near - critical collapse is characterized by a critical exponent @xmath190 , defined by the scaling relation @xmath191 , for a quantity @xmath192 with dimension @xmath193 depending on a parameter @xmath151 ( with @xmath194 for the critical solution ) .",
    "choosing for @xmath192 the radius @xmath195 of the apparent horizon , and identifying @xmath196 with the perturbation amplitude @xmath179 , we obtain from ( [ trap1 ] ) r_ah ( ) ^2/5 , leading to the value of the critical exponent @xmath1 , in agreement with the renormalization group argument @xcite leading to @xmath197 .",
    "we have discussed in detail the causal structure of the garfinkle css solutions ( [ gar1 ] ) to the @xmath198 einstein - scalar field equations . from a special solution of this class ,",
    "we have derived by a limiting process a new css solution , which we have extended to a unique solution of the full @xmath7 equations , describing collapse of the scalar field onto a null central singularity .",
    "this is not a curvature singularity ( all the curvature invariants remain finite ) , but a singularity in the causal structure similar to that of the btz black hole .",
    "finally , we have analyzed linear perturbations of the @xmath7 solution , found a single eigenmode @xmath199 , checked that this mode does indeed give rise to black holes , and determined the critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "for comparison , choptuik and pretorius @xcite derived , by analysing the observed scaling behavior of the maximum scalar curvature , the value @xmath200 for the critical exponent .",
    "this value is different from the value @xmath201 obtained in the numerical analysis of husain and olivier @xcite from the scaling behavior of the apparent horizon radius .",
    "our value @xmath202 , while significantly smaller than these two conflicting estimates , is of the order of the theoretical value @xmath203 derived either from the analysis of dust - ring collapse @xcite , of black hole formation from point particle collisions @xcite , or of the @xmath204 to @xmath205 transition of the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , even though they were obtained for a vanishing cosmological constant and thus solve the @xmath206 equations only near the singularity , the garfinkle css solutions are , for the particular value ( chosen in order to better fit the numerical curves ) @xmath207 , in good agreement @xcite with the numerical results of @xcite at an intermediate time .",
    "the fact that this value is close to 1 suggests that the @xmath208 css solution ( [ gar5 ] ) approximately describes near - critical collapse at intermediate times .",
    "if this the case , then it would not be surprising if its late - time limit , our new css solution eq .",
    "( [ crit0 ] ) , gives a good description of exactly critical collapse near the singularity .",
    "a fuller understanding of the relationship between the numerically observed near - critical collapse and these various @xmath8 css solutions could be achieved by extending them to @xmath7 , as done in the present work for the special solution ( [ crit1 ] ) ."
