    "in the small area estimation methodology , the model - based empirical bayes approach has become very popular to produce indirect estimates since a design - based direct estimate of a small area characteristic based on the area sample is usually less reliable because the size of the area sample is small .",
    "importance and usefulness of model - based small area estimation approach may be assessed from an explosive growth of research publications . for a recent comprehensive review of this literature",
    ", one may refer to rao ( 2003 ) , jiang and lahiri ( 2006 ) , and pfeffermann ( 2013 ) .",
    "random effects models can account for the lack of fit of a regression model and increase precision of estimation for small area mean . the representative model for area - level data",
    "is fay - herriot model ( fay and herriot , 1979 ) described as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is s parameter of interest corresponding to the true mean value in the @xmath2-th area , @xmath3 is the sampling error distributed as @xmath4 for known @xmath5 s , and @xmath6 denotes the random effect distributed as @xmath7 with unknown scalar @xmath8 .",
    "recently , however , datta , hall and mandal ( 2011 ) showed that if the random effects can be dispensed with via a suitable test , then the model parameters and the small area means may be estimated with substantially higher accuracy . in response to this work ,",
    "datta and mandal ( 2015 ) proposed the fay - herriot model with uncertain random effects given by @xmath9 for @xmath10 . in datta and mandal ( 2015 ) , the term @xmath11 is called  uncertain random effect \" since the distribution of @xmath12 is expressed as a mixture of @xmath13 and the one - point distribution on @xmath14 .",
    "then , in this setting , the marginal density of @xmath15 is @xmath16 which is a mixture density of the marginal density of the usual fay - herriot model and the simple regression model without random effects .",
    "the resulting bayes estimator ( predictor ) of @xmath1 is given by @xmath17 it is noted that if we put @xmath18 , it follows @xmath19 resulting the usual linear estimator of @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the shrinkage coefficient @xmath21 depends on @xmath15 as well as @xmath5 , and @xmath22 increases as the squared residual @xmath23 increases .",
    "thus if the squared residual is small , which corresponds to the case where @xmath15 is well explained by @xmath24 , the shrinkage coefficient gets smaller and @xmath25 becomes close to the regression estimator @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the use of the uncertain random effect enables us to take the information about how much @xmath24 can explain @xmath15 in each area into the small area predictor .    in datta and mandal ( 2015 ) , they focus on an extension of the fay - herriot model to the situation incorporating uncertain random effects . in real application , however , we often encounter count data as well as continuous data , and the models such as the fay - herriot model based on normal distributions are not apparently appropriate for analyzing count data .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider , a class of distributions , the natural exponential family with quadratic variance functions , including binomial and poisson distributions as well as normal distributions .",
    "this class of distributions was originally investigated in morris ( 1982 , 1983 ) , and the small - area models based on this family were developed by ghosh and maiti ( 2004 ) .",
    "to implement the idea of uncertain random effects into this family of distributions , we rewrite the fay - herriot model ( [ urefh ] ) with uncertain random effects as @xmath27 this means that one of the two distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 is randomly chosen based on the random variable @xmath30 . for the parameter @xmath20 in the natural exponential family , we can use the same idea to construct prior distributions with uncertain choice of two prior distributions , namely the conjugate prior distribution and the one - point distribution degenerated at @xmath26 .",
    "the detailed model settings are described in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "when the uncertain prior distribution is assumed for @xmath20 in the natural exponential family with quadratic variance functions , we derive the bayes estimator of @xmath20 , which we call uncertain bayes ( ub ) estimator .",
    "the hyper - parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimators of the marginal likelihood . by plugging the point estimators into the ub estimator",
    ", we provide the empirical uncertain bayes ( eub ) estimator of @xmath20 . for calibration of uncertainty of the eub estimator",
    ", we consider the conditional mean squared error ( cmse ) and derive the second - order unbiased estimator motivated from the work of booth and hobert ( 1998 ) , datta , kubokawa , molina and rao ( 2011 ) and sugasawa and kubokawa ( 2014 ) . as typical examples ,",
    "we handle three models , namely the fay - herriot model for continuous data , the poisson - gamma and binomial - beta models for count data .",
    "it is shown that the shrinkage property pointed out in datta and mandal ( 2015 ) in the fay - herriot model still holds in both the poisson - gamma and binomial - beta models .",
    "that is , the shrinkage coefficient in the ub estimator decreases as the @xmath15 gets close to the regression ( synthetic ) estimator .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we provide the detailed description of the proposed empirical bayes model and some useful examples . in section",
    "[ sec : mse ] , we propose the cmse as well as the second - order unbiased estimator for risk evaluation .",

    "[ tab : cmse ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we apply the uncertain poisson - gamma model given in section [ sec : example ] to the mortality data in japan . the data set consists of the observed number of mortality @xmath268 and its expected number @xmath33 of man in the @xmath2-th city or town in tokyo prefecture , japan , before world war ii . as the covariate",
    ", we use logarithm of the direct estimates of mortality ratio of women .",
    "thus we extract the areas where the direct estimates of mortality ratio of women is positive .",
    "such area - level data are available for @xmath269 cities , towns and villages , and the total number of mortality in the whole region is @xmath270 .",
    "the expected numbers are adjusted on the basis of the population so that @xmath271 .",
    "the standardized mortality ratio ( smr ) is defined by the ratio of the actual number of mortality to the expected number of mortality for each area .",
    "then , the direct estimator of smr in the @xmath2-th area is @xmath113 .",
    "however , the direct estimator of smr @xmath15 is not very reliable when @xmath33 is not so large . actually , in this data set , the lower and upper @xmath272 quantiles are @xmath273 and @xmath274 , respectively .",
    "thus we obtain the model based estimator of smr in each area using the uncertain poisson - gamma model described as @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the mortality ratio of woman and @xmath277 denotes the ` true ' smr in the @xmath2-th area , which we want to estimate .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath278 in the uncertain poisson - gamma ( upg ) model and @xmath279 in the poisson - gamma ( pg ) model are given by @xmath280 the estimate @xmath281 in the upg model indicates that the usual pg model is not necessarily appropriate for this data .",

    "that is , in this case , the smr of man @xmath15 is well explained by smr of woman @xmath276 such that the random effect is not always needed in most areas . on the other hand , in the area where @xmath276 can not explain much of @xmath15 ,",

    "we have found that the eub - cmse estimates are smaller than the eb - cmse estimates in more than @xmath284 areas .",
    "moreover , in more than half areas , the eub - cmse estimates can improve more than @xmath284 of the eb - cmse estimates . for 120 areas with area number @xmath287",
