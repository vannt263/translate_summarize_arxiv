    "mathematical characterization of infectious diseases has contributed greatly to getting insight on transmission patterns of a disease in host populations , as well as on public health policies to prevent , reduce , and possibly eradicate the disease @xcite .",
    "classical epidemic models usually assume that either individuals do not have immunity to infection ( the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model ) or experiencing infection with permanent or temporary protection against it ( susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) and susceptible - infected - recovered - susceptible ( sirs ) models ) . however , there is increasing evidence that most infections , such as pertussis and tuberculosis , can provide only partial immunity and spread among seropositive individuals , regardless of a reduced transmission rate . in view of this",
    "fact , vaccination was introduced into mathematical compartmental models which is often represented by a transfer between the susceptible and removed classes @xcite .",
    "whether vaccination is inoculation or education , typically it reaches only a fraction of the susceptible populations and is not perfectly effective .",
    "thus , a backward transfer must be considered because vaccinated individuals may return to be susceptible or become directly infected . when these aspects are included in the model",
    ", rich dynamical behaviors may arise , such as backward bifurcation and bistability @xcite .    previous studies of mathematical models incorporating vaccination either ignore the population structure or treat populations as distributed in a regular medium , that is , all the individuals have the same probability of contacting the others . recently",
    ", classical epidemic models have been extended in many ways ( e.g. , to study the disease spreading in a population divided into subgroups which may influence each other @xcite ) .",
    "especially , a great source of inspiration to mathematical epidemiology has been provided by the network theory whose nodes represent individuals and links stand for interactions among them @xcite .",
    "the structure of the underlying network ( e.g. , the degree distribution ) may strongly influence spreading dynamics @xcite .",
    "for instance , in scale - free ( sf ) networks , characterized by degree distributions with power - law behavior @xmath0 , the statistical relevance of hubs makes the network highly permeable to disease propagating @xcite .",
    "this radical change in the behavior of the processes suggests that the standard epidemiological frameworks should be carefully revisited .",
    "the mathematical compartmental theory focuses on epidemic equilibria and their stability .",
    "the network - based modeling , however , pays much attention to the underlying contact structure among individuals .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the influence of vaccination on disease spreading .",
    "different from the classic study of the sis model with vaccination by the compartmental theory which focuses on the stability of equilibria @xcite , the present work revisits the model on watts - strogatz ( ws ) , barabsi - albert ( ba ) , and random sf networks concentrating on the epidemic threshold and prevalence .",
    "the choice of this model is based on three factors as follows .",
    "( i ) the sis epidemic framework has been widely used in modeling disease spreading within a population .",
    "each individual is simply assumed to have only one of the two states : susceptible ( s ) and infected ( i ) .",
    "each susceptible individual gets infection with a transmission rate @xmath1 once it contacts an infected one .",
    "meanwhile , infected individuals recover and become susceptible again with a recovery rate @xmath2 . then the process of disease transmission flows as s@xmath3i@xmath3s .",
    "( ii ) immunization of population through vaccination strategy is an important and feasible practice with obvious implications for the public health . at the population level",
    ", it is interesting to determine the critical vaccination rate necessary for eradicating diseases or preventing infection , and to investigate how vaccination affects the epidemic prevalence in the steady state on different networks . in this paper , to study possible effects of vaccination on epidemic dynamics in different networked populations , a vaccinated ( v ) state is introduced into the sis model by vaccinating the susceptible individuals with a vaccination rate @xmath4 , corresponding to the transition s@xmath3v .",
    "( iii ) in the real world , there are various types of vaccines : some may offer temporary immunity ; vaccines may not possess 100% efficacy ( leaky vaccines ) @xcite , and finally , on most occasions , vaccination may cover only a fraction of susceptible individuals .",
    "therefore , the vaccinated individuals return to the susceptible class with a resusceptibility rate @xmath5 as the vaccine wears off , or directly get infected with a reduced transmission rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the degree to which the vaccine - induced protection against infection is inefficient .",
    "thus , the vaccinated class flows in two directions s@xmath8v@xmath3i .    to study the sis model with vaccination on networks , both analytical calculations and numerical simulations",
    "are carried out .",
    "depending on network structures , two types of epidemic thresholds and corresponding prevalence behavior are obtained . for ws networks , there is a nonzero threshold similar to that obtained in the classic compartmental model .",
    "whereas for sf networks , the threshold is quite different which is strongly related both to the vaccination rate and to the node - degree distribution . while the disease is endemic in the network , it is found that vaccination intervention contributes to linearly reducing the prevalence in ws networks , whereas in sf networks it functions exponentially .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the sis model with vaccination is introduced .",
    "then the model is studied on ws , ba , and random sf networks in secs .",
    "iii , iv , and v , respectively .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "vi .     and",
    "are vaccinated at a per capita rate @xmath4 .",
    "infected nodes recover to be susceptible at a per capita rate @xmath2 .",
    "vaccinated nodes become susceptible at a per capita rate @xmath5 and are infected at a per capita rate @xmath6 due to imperfect vaccination . ]",
    "vaccination scheme has always been a very important and effective way for preventing or controlling infectious diseases . in reality",
    ", vaccines hardly cover the whole population , and only remain effective for a finite period of time , and are difficult to guarantee a perfect protection from infection . taking all these points into consideration ,",
    "kribs - zaleta and velasco - hernndez introduced a vaccinated state into the sis model to theoretically study the possible effects of vaccination on epidemics @xcite . the mathematical compartmental model in ref .",
    "@xcite neglects the population structure and assumes all individuals have the same contact rate .",
    "therefore , it is intriguing to inspect the vaccination program for different network structures .    in this paper the sis model with vaccination",
    "is formulated on the static network framework , where nodes represent individuals and links stand for the contacts among individuals along which a disease can spread . at each time step",
    ", each node exists in only one of the three states : susceptible , infected and vaccinated .",
    "a disease spreads in the network following mechanisms below ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : a susceptible node will be infected with the transmission rate @xmath1 once it is connected to an infected one ; an infected node is cured and become susceptible again with the recovery rate @xmath2 ; according to the random vaccination strategy , each susceptible node gets vaccinated with the vaccination rate @xmath4 and each vaccinated node returns to the susceptible class at the resusceptibility rate @xmath5 as the vaccine wears off ; due to the imperfect immunity , a vaccinated node will be infected with a reduced infection rate @xmath6 , where the parameter @xmath7 measures the inefficacy of the vaccine - induced protection against infection ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively represent completely effective and utterly invalid , but @xmath11 holds for most cases @xcite ) . in present work it is always assumed that @xmath7 is sufficiently small .",
    "the epidemic dynamics is determined by five parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 . for convenience , two ratios @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath13 are particularly denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .    in the theoretical study of epidemiology , there are two paramount indicators .",
    "one is to formulate the epidemic threshold , which determines whether the infection breaks out in the population and results in an ee or dies out eventually corresponding to a dfe  @xcite .",
    "the other is to predict the epidemic prevalence .",
    "the present work make a comprehensive study of the sis model with vaccination on ws , ba , and random sf networks , employing the mean - field ( mf ) approach and computational simulations .",
    "as will be seen below , vaccination indeed has a great influence on the epidemic dynamics over such networks .",
    "the ws network @xcite , as a reference of homogeneous networks , can be constructed as follows .",
    "start from a ring of @xmath16 nodes , where each node is connected symmetrically with its @xmath17 nearest neighbors .",
    "then , every link connected to a clockwise neighbor is rewired to a randomly chosen node with probability @xmath18 . after the whole sweep ,",
    "a ws network with the average connectivity @xmath19 is generated .",

    "( [ eq:1a ] ) accounts for the recovery process from the infected class , which is proportional to the recovery rate @xmath2 , the average density @xmath22 of infected nodes . the second term on the rhs in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) denotes the newly infected nodes transferred from susceptible ones .",
    "it is proportional to the density @xmath21 of susceptible nodes , the transmission rate @xmath1 , the average number of neighbors @xmath20 , and the probability @xmath22 that a randomly chosen neighbor is infected .",
    "similarly , the third term on the rhs in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) considers the probability that a node is vaccinated @xmath27 $ ] , and gets infection .",
    "the probability of this last process is proportional to the vaccine - reduced transmission rate @xmath28 , the average number of neighbors @xmath20 , and the probability @xmath22 that a randomly chosen neighbor is infected . on the rhs in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1b ] ) , the third term accounts for the increment in the susceptible class result from the transition v@xmath3s , which is proportional to the resusceptibility rate @xmath5 ; and the fourth term accounts for the probability of the vaccination process s@xmath3v , which is proportional to the vaccination rate @xmath4 .",
    "it should be stressed that the mf approach ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) ) is equivalent to the mass - action law ( system ( 1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the adaptation of the reaction rates to include the average connectivity @xmath20 .",
