    "dilatation symmetry and its anomaly could play an important role for cosmology @xcite .",
    "models with a dilatation symmetric fixed point could provide a dynamical solution for the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "as one of the most characteristic features such models have predicted the presence of a homogeneous dark energy component @xcite , long before its observational discovery .",
    "recent investigations of higher dimensional settings have shed new light on such theories @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that dimensional reduction of a dilatation symmetric quantum effective action in higher dimensions leads to four - dimensional models with a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "if the cosmological solution approaches the dilatation symmetric fixed point in the limit @xmath0 , such models can naturally give rise to an asymptotically vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "in such a scenario the observed particle masses are due to the spontaneous breaking of dilatation symmetry by the cosmological or vacuum solution . at the fixed point",
    "one will therefore encounter a massless goldstone boson - the dilaton . for finite time",
    ", the dilatation symmetry is broken by anomalous terms which generate a small time - dependent mass for the dilaton .",
    "this picture can give rise to a quintessence cosmology where the dilaton rolling towards the fixed point plays the role of the scalar `` cosmon''-field with a slowly decreasing mass @xcite .",
    "this higher dimensional dilatation symmetric setup naturally leads to scaling solutions where the cosmon mass tracks the hubble parameter .",
    "first investigations of the manifold of extrema of a dilatation symmetric higher - dimensional quantum effective action often reveal the presence of additional massless scalar fields besides the dilaton @xcite .",
    "these may correspond to a change of the characteristic length scale of internal space - the radion - , or other changes in geometry , similar to the moduli fields in string theory . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on one such field and name it the `` bolon  , since it will be ultimately responsible for dark matter and therefore for the emergence of structure ( i.e. ' ' lumps `` or ' ' bola \" ) in the cosmos .",
    "we start with a quick revision of the key concept of dilatation symmetry",
    ". then we will investigate the coupled system of cosmon and bolon and show that it can reproduce the standard cosmological evolution at the background level for rather simple potentials .",
    "after a radiation dominated period , during which the cosmon and bolon act as early dark energy and play a subdominant role , the bolon starts to oscillate around a partial potential minimum .",
    "its oscillation energy ( potential and kinetic ) is diluted as non - relativistic matter and thus it will eventually become dominant , enforcing a transition to a matter dominated period .",
    "after the transition the fluid equations for the energy density of bolon fluctuations obey the standard form for cold dark matter , with a small coupling to the cosmon .",
    "thus the simple model with two scalars describes a cosmology with coupled dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we further proceed to slight modifications of the simplest potential for which dark energy finally dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "this can be achieved by an effective stop in the cosmon evolution , induced either by a characteristic change in the scalar potential or a leaping kinetic term , or if the scaling behaviour of the cosmon gets terminated by a cosmic trigger event .",
    "an example of the last scenario is given by the growing neutrino quintessence model @xcite .",
    "dilatations correspond to a rescaling of each dynamical field of a given theory corresponding to an appropriate scaling dimension . for a theory involving a metric @xmath1 and a scalar field @xmath2 in @xmath3 dimensions this means _ ^2",
    "g _ , ^-((d-2)/2 ) .",
    "any dilatation symmetric quantum effective action @xmath4 is then given by an action = d^4x g^1/2 with ^-d under dilatations .",
    "this puts severe restrictions on the allowed interactions in @xmath5 .",
    "dilatation symmetry ensures the absence of any explicit mass scales of the model .",
    "these restrictions have particularly interesting consequences in a higher dimensional setting . for @xmath6",
    "no polynomial potential for the scalar field is allowed , and dimensional reduction of such a higher dimensional dilatation symmetric theory gives rise to a rather generic class of effective four - dimensional theories with a vanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this finding has been generalized to arbitrary dilatation symmetric @xmath4 , for example based only on the metric without a scalar field @xcite .    in our scenario",
    "we consider theories with a dilatation symmetric fixed point , which corresponds to field configurations reached in the limit of cosmic time going to infinity .",
    "one possibility is to start with a generic action @xmath4 , not necessarily dilatation symmetric , and to consider a family @xmath7 obtained by a rescaling _ = .",
    "this becomes dilatation symmetric in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "one may imagine that a dynamical runaway solution drives @xmath9 effectively to infinity for @xmath10 , for example by a monotonic increase of the cosmological value of the scalar @xmath2 .",
    "dimensional reduction of such an action leads to infinitely many fields in four dimensions .",
    "we consider only massless or light fields which play a role in cosmology after a possible inflationary period .",
    "they are described by an effective theory , encoded in the four - dimensional , dimensionally reduced action , plus the metric and the particles of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the latter will dominate the radiation dominated era , while in the matter dominated era the small component of baryons is subleading and can be neglected for the overall picture of dark matter .",
    "our starting point for the effective action of two scalars @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a standard kinetic term and a potential @xmath13 .",
    "dilatation symmetry at the fixed point enforces the common potential of the two fields to vanish for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "away from the dilatation symmetric fixed point the four - dimensional quantum effective action will contain an effective potential @xmath13 for the cosmon field @xmath11 and the bolon field @xmath12 , generated by dilatation anomalies .",
    "the formulation in terms of the quantum effective action means that no further quantum corrections to the potential are present .",
    "if we were to start at the classical theory , various quantum corrections would appear in the process of quantization .",
    "they may in fact be responsible for the existence of a fixed point . in this case",
    "the effective dilatation symmetry at the fixed point is due to quantum fluctuations ( rather than being destroyed by them ) and may be realized even for a classical action without dilatation symmetry . in the vicinity of a fixed point",
    "asymptotic dilatation symmetry guarantees that the potential vanishes as the fixed point is approached for @xmath14 .",
    "it also ensures a vanishing mass at the fixed point .",
    "the bolon mass also vanishes at the fixed point .",
    "we work within the effective four - dimensional theory ( obtained after dimensional reduction ) and use the einstein frame ( with fixed planck mass ) .",
    "furthermore we assume first a normalization of @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that both have standard kinetic terms . in this frame",
    "the @xmath11-dependence of the potential is typically of exponential shape @xcite and we start with a simple model where [ v ] v = m^4  . here",
    "@xmath15 is the four - dimensional effective planck mass and @xmath16 is the scale of anomalous dilatation symmetry breaking .",
    "we assume the dimensionless constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be all positive . the \" anomalous dimensions  @xmath17 , @xmath18 characterize the impact of explicit mass scales of the model ( violation of dilatation symmetry ) on the four - dimensional world .",
    "the asymptotic solution will correspond to @xmath14 where the potential @xmath21 vanishes and dilatation symmetry becomes exact .",
    "then also the mass matrix for the cosmon and bolon , given by the second derivatives of @xmath21 , approaches zero .",
    "the simple quadratic form for @xmath12 is assumed to be a good approximation for @xmath12 close to a partial minimum of the potential in this direction .",
    "small deviations of @xmath12 from the partial extremum will be sufficient for the understanding of late cosmology .",
    "for very early cosmology the quadratic approximation for @xmath12 may become insufficient and we discuss generalizations below .",
    "there we also briefly address the possibility that the @xmath11-dependence of the partial minimum for @xmath12 can not be neglected ( as for the potential ( [ v ] ) ) .",
    "an important ingredient for our setting concerns the observation that the approach to the fixed point at @xmath14 , @xmath22 can be characterized by a different scaling for the cosmon and the bolon directions . for @xmath12 at its minimum the size of the \" anomalous potential  is dictated by the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "different parameters @xmath18 and @xmath20 may describe the scaling of @xmath21 away from the partial minimum , e.g. for @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic scaling behaviour and its motivation by the properties of solutions in the vicinity of a higher dimensional dilatation symmetric fixed point distinguishes our approach from other settings where dark energy and dark matter are described by two scalar fields , as realized , for example , in a model for the axion and the cosmon or in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . due to the factor @xmath24",
    "the mass of the bolon field will depend on the value of the cosmon field .",
    "if the bolon plays the role of dark matter we expect a coupling between dark energy and dark matter @xmath25 , as discussed previously in models of coupled quintessence @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that a cosmon - bolon coupling is necessary in our setting since the bolon mass is assumed to vanish for the asymptotic solution .",
    "to simplify the analysis of the dynamics , we perform a shift @xmath26 which corresponds to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "this rescaling shows that our model depends effectively on three parameters , namely the dimensionless couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the effective scale for the bolon mass , which involves the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "we define the energy densities [ rho_phi ] _ & = & ^2+m^4 e^-/m  , + [ rho_chi ] _ & = & ^2+m^4()^ e^-2 /m ( ) ^2 , which will be associated with dark energy and dark matter components respectively .",
    "in addition to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we assume that the universe also contains a homogeneous radiation component @xmath32 which dominates at early times .    the @xmath11-dependent mass of the bolon , reflected by the factor @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ rho_chi ] ) , will lead to a coupling between dark matter and dark energy of strength @xmath20 , similar to generic models models of coupled quintessence @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that in our model the coupling between the bolon and the cosmon does not arise from matter particles coupling to a metric related to the einstein frame metric by a conformal transformation as e.g. in generalized jordan - brans - dicke theories @xcite .",
    "it rather emerges as a feature of the common cosmon - bolon potential from the breaking of dilatation symmetry and is crucial to restore dilatation symmetry at the fixed point .",
    "possible couplings of the cosmon to other forms of matter as baryons or neutrinos are not directly related to the coupling @xmath20 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "in particular , there is no reason to expect a baryon - cosmon coupling of equal strength as the coupling between dark matter and dark energy .",
    "limits on the time variation of couplings and violations of the weak equivalence principle imply for most models that the baryon - cosmon coupling must be much smaller than the value of @xmath20 discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to add a baryonic fluid which can be either uncoupled , very weakly coupled or coupled with gravitational strength to the dilaton without qualitatively changing our conclusions . in the last case , however , one would need to invoke some kind of mechanism to avoid constraints from local tests of gravity , like the damour - polyakov effect @xcite or the chameleon mechanism @xcite .    for @xmath34 , the two terms in ( [ v ] ) decay at different rates as @xmath35 .",
    "the qualitative features of the dynamics in the early radiation dominated epoch depend on the ratio of @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the magnitude of the prefactor @xmath36 .",
    "we start by discussing solutions for which the potential ( [ v ] ) is dominated by the first term in the early radiation dominated universe and the second term becomes dominant at late times causing a transition into a matter dominated epoch .",
    "the growth of the second term in ( [ v ] ) relative to the first one requires @xmath37 , but we will actually impose a stronger condition , @xmath38 .",
    "this will also ensure that the resulting dark matter - dark energy interaction remains compatible with cosmological observations .",
