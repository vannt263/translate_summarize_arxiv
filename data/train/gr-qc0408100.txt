    "there is a renewed interest on non commutative theories in physics , one of the reasons for that is that noncommutativity between coordinates appears in string theory : in the toroidal compactification of matrix theory @xcite and in open string theory with a b - field background @xcite .",
    "noncommutative classical @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite has been considered .",
    "the effects of noncommutativity has been studied also in gravity @xcite . in the field of quantum cosmology , noncommutativity of the minisuperspace",
    "coordinates was introduce by compean _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they studied the kantowski - sachs metric and were able to find the exact wave function , with which wave packets were constructed and found new quantum states that `` compete '' to be the most probable state , in clear contrast with the commutative case",
    ". a tunnelling process could be possible among these different states for the universe .",
    "we want to explore the effects of noncommutativity in quantum cosmology when matter fields are included .",
    "in this work we want to study noncommutative cosmology with some matter included and not just pure gravity as was the case of @xcite . in order to have an exact solution we must consider a geometry with high symmetry , the robertson - walker - friedmann models.for the matter content of our model we will consider the low energy limit of string theory and we will have an scalar field besides the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "some other gravitational theories of the scalar - tensor type are under consideration @xcite . at low energy , the tree - level ,",

    "when we consider this theory in the metric of isotropic and homogeneous spacetime , after integrating by parts , and using the convenient time parametrization @xmath6 , reduces to ( in the gauge @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath10 where the canonical conjugate momenta are , @xmath11 the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation , in a particular factor ordering is @xmath12\\psi(\\phi,\\beta)=0 .",
