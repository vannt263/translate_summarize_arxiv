    "the behaviour of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is of continuing interest in many fields of physics as the reduced number of dimensions give rise to a number of peculiar properties . in highly correlated systems , where the potential energy due to the interaction dominates over the thermal energy ( for recent overviews see @xcite ) , 2d many - particle systems",

    "these modes appear as higher harmonics of the magnetoplasmon in non - dissipative 2d yukawa systems  @xcite and are reminiscent of the classical bernstein modes  @xcite .",
    "unlike these , however , the observed higher harmonics are not a pure magnetic effect but are , additionally , fundamentally affected by the strong correlations between particles , as was demonstrated in ref .",

    "evidently , the data points are well described by a decay of the form @xmath76 .",
    "the first of the higher harmonics ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) appears with an intensity of about one hundredth of the magnetoplasmon .",
    "such intensities are observable against the background noise in typical dusty plasma experiments  @xcite .",
    "the frictionless yukawa system is ( at fixed magnetization @xmath25 ) characterized by two parameters : the inverse temperature ( coulomb coupling parameter ) @xmath52 and the interaction range ( inverse debye length ) @xmath53 .",
    "the influence of the temperature is investigated by changing , at a fixed value of @xmath53 , the coupling parameter  @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : var - g_alt ] , different situations are depicted for a system with @xmath64 , ranging from intermediate coupling ( @xmath78 ) to strong ( @xmath58 ) and very strong coupling ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath79 , the system is already far in the microcrystalline regime , @xmath80 .",
    "the decreased thermal background makes the fundamental and higher harmonics stand out very clearly at strong coupling , and the signal - to - noise ratio is higher in these cases .",
    "for example , harmonics with @xmath81 are far easier to distinguish at @xmath79 than at @xmath82 .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath83 between the intensity of the @xmath21th harmonic and the fundamental is , however , clearly decreased for stronger coupling  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that a certain degree of disorder is required for an effective generation of higher harmonics , which in turn might depend on anharmonic effects that are less important in highly ordered systems .",
    "having established the influence of the temperature ( inverse coupling ) , we now determine the influence of the interaction range . to this end , in fig .",
    "[ fig : g100 ] , we show the combined mode spectra at a fixed @xmath56 for different values of @xmath53 and two values of @xmath84 .",
    "the curves appear very similar , with comparable signal - to - noise - ratios and similar relative intensities of the higher harmonics .",
    "this is despite the strong differences in structural order among the systems reflected in the different radial pair distribution functions ( rpdf , inset of fig  [ fig : g100 ] ) defined as @xmath85 the sole effect of an increase in @xmath53 on the higher harmonics is a systematic shift toward smaller frequencies .",
    "this result is not unexpected and indeed predicted by eq .  : with increasing @xmath53 , the particle oscillations decrease in frequency as the interparticle potential becomes more lenient .",
    "the einstein frequency , therefore , diminishes with increasing @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : omega_e ] ) and , consequently , so do the frequencies at which the higher harmonics appear .",
    "so far we have investigated the influence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the higher harmonics .",
    "a change of either of these parameters also affects the structural properties of the system . by changing @xmath52 and @xmath53 simultaneously in such a way that the rpdf remains practically unchanged  @xcite , we can compare systems with identical structural properties .",
    "we achieve this by fixing the ratio of the temperature to the point of ( micro-)crystallization , @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "systems corresponding to the same @xmath87 but different @xmath52 have thus the same structural order but different thermal energy .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : geff048 ] , where a fixed value of @xmath88 is maintained for systems with different values of  @xmath53 .",
    "a combination of the two previously described effects is observed : the higher harmonics shift toward lower frequency with increasing  @xmath53 , and decay more slowly albeit with a decreased signal - to - noise - ratio with increasing temperature ( inverse coupling ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find that the generation of higher harmonics is nearly independent of the intricate details of the structure and the range of the interaction between the particles ( except for a systematic frequency shift ) but , instead , is dominated by the thermal energy available to the system .     for identical temperature ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath89 ( highest to lowest curve ) , @xmath59 .",
    "the curves are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "the inset shows the rpdf @xmath90 . ]     for identical structural properties corresponding to @xmath91 but different @xmath89 ( highest to lowest curve ) , @xmath59 .",
    "the inset shows the rpdf @xmath90 . ]      , @xmath57 , @xmath92 : combined mode spectra for different values of the friction strength , from @xmath93 ( top curve ) to @xmath94 ( lowest curve ) . ]    besides noise resulting from the measurement itself , many physical systems are also influenced by fluctuations due to the coupling to their surroundings . in many cases ,",
    "these fluctuations and dissipation effects are well described by a constant friction and stochastic noise , an approach which has been used extensively in the description of , e.g. , dusty plasmas .",
    "we now introduce dissipation and stochastic noise in our md simulations to estimate the effect of friction - induced noise on the fluctuation spectra .",
    "in other words , we now include the term   in eq .  .    in fig",
    "[ fig : g200b05_v ] , we depict the longitudinal fluctuation spectrum @xmath39 for fixed values of @xmath95 , @xmath25 and @xmath52 , while varying the magnitude of the friction @xmath54 .",
    "as expected , the inclusion of friction has a two - fold effect : a ) the overall noise level in the spectrum is increased and begins to overlap the higher harmonics and b ) the peaks in the spectra become increasingly broader with higher friction .",
    "the noise resulting from the friction clearly dominates the intrinsic noise for the data depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : g200b05_v ] .",
    "the high-@xmath96 limit of the spectra increases linearly with the friction coefficient . from the data presented in fig .  [ fig : g200b05_v ] , we conclude that at a moderately coupled liquid state , @xmath58 and @xmath64 , the detection of the second harmonic is possible at @xmath92 and a friction of @xmath97 ( note that @xmath54 is given here in units of the nominal plasma frequency ) .",
    "we now give estimates for the plasma parameters required to observe the generation of higher harmonics under experimental conditions . the main obstacle in attaining our simulation conditions in experiments",
    "are the required high magnetic fields . combining the formulas for the cyclotron frequency @xmath68 and the plasma frequency @xmath98 and solving for the magnetic field , we obtain ( in si units ) : @xmath99 \\approx 2.7\\cdot 10 ^ 5\\beta   \\left ( \\frac{r}{a}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\rho\\left[\\frac{\\textrm{kg}}{\\textrm m^3}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the mass density .",
    "typical 2d dusty plasma parameters are @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , giving rise ( for @xmath104 ) to a required magnetic field strength of about @xmath105 , which is at the edge of current experimental possibilities . that number can be reduced by using lighter particles or compressing the system to decrease the inter - particle spacing ( an increase of the average density by a factor of , e.g. , @xmath106 lowers the magnetic field requirements by 40% ) . also note that the required magnetic field is independent of particle charge , which , however , enters into the coupling parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the dissipation in 2d dusty plasma experiments can be quite low , a typical value is @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "thus , according to our simulations , friction at this rate should not prevent the generation of the higher harmonics .",
    "it is , however , not uncommon to experience friction rates in excess of @xmath108 , at which the observation of the higher harmonics is not possible . in conclusion",
    ", the observation of higher harmonics appears as a possible experimental venue but poses several challenging restraints on the experimental setup .",
    "in this work , we have compared the previously derived theoretical description of the mode spacing of the higher harmonics with extended md simulations and found excellent agreement over a wide range of coupling strengths and interaction range .",
    "we have also , for the first time , demonstrated that the generation of higher harmonics is present in strongly correlated systems with coulomb interaction as well , which is especially interesting in the light of additional possibilities for experimental verification .",
    "the relative intensities of the higher harmonics have also been investigated and were found to decay , to a very good approximation , exponentially with the order of the harmonics .",
    "finally , we have included dissipation in our simulations and estimated the maximum acceptable level of such friction for experiments . combining estimates for the strength of the magnetic field and the maximum friction levels ,",
    "we conclude that the experimental observation of higher harmonics is possible but challenging .",
    "finally , we expect that our results are also of direct relevance for strongly correlated quantum plasmas . in the case of magnetized",
    "ideal quantum plasmas the `` traditional '' bernstein modes have been predicted theoretically long ago by horing et al .",
    "@xcite and were observed experimentally in electron - hole plasmas , e.g. @xcite . in recent years",
    "strongly correlated quantum coulomb systems , including liquid states and wigner crystals of electrons @xcite , holes @xcite and excitons , e.g. @xcite , moved into the focus of research .",
    "it is expected that these systems , if placed into a strong magnetic field , should exhibit a similar spectrum of `` dressed bernstein modes '' as their classical counterpart studied in the present paper .",
