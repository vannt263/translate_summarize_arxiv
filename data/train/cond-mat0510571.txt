    "the transfer - matrix method used here is related to that used in ref .  , and it uses in addition some of the techniques described in refs .   and for the random - cluster and the o(@xmath0 ) model respectively .",
    "the full description of the transfer matrix is somewhat elaborate , and here we only provide a general outline , supplemented with more detailed information where the procedure is different from those in the references given .    as in ref .",
    ", the transfer matrix is constructed on the basis of a graph representation of the cubic model that allows @xmath0 to be non - integer .",
    "however , the present work is restricted to the case @xmath79 , so that the graphs are restricted to be even .",

    "we define the model on an @xmath104 lattice @xmath105 wrapped on a cylinder , such that the finite - size parameter @xmath106 is the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "the definition of the transfer matrix can be illustrated by appending row @xmath107 and determining how this affects the partition sum of the model .",
    "the lattice @xmath105 has an open end at row @xmath108 ; there are @xmath106 ` dangling ' edges that will serve to connect to row @xmath107 later . whereas the partition sum eq .",
    "( [ zcub3 ] ) allows only for closed loops , the bond configuration on @xmath105 may be considered a part of a larger graph so that we allow the dangling edges to be occupied by loop segments . but all sites are still restricted to connect to an even number of bonds . for the construction of the transfer matrix , we need a coding of all possible ways ( called connectivities ) that the dangling bonds can be connected by the graph @xmath32 on @xmath105 .",
    "this coding assigns a unique integer @xmath109 , which will serve as the transfer - matrix index , to each connectivity .",
    "some of the dangling edges may be empty , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the remaining dangling edges , i.e. , the dangling bonds , form a ` dense connectivity ' without vacant positions . note that these dense connectivities satisfy a ` well - nestedness ' principle which asserts that , if positions @xmath7 and @xmath110 are connected , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are connected , with @xmath113 , then all @xmath114 must be connected .",
    "thus , these dense connectivities form a subset of the ` random cluster ' or ` whitney ' connectivities defined in ref .",
    ". the number of dangling bonds that are connected by a path of bonds must always be even for the cubic model ; this restriction does not apply to those of ref .  .",
    "by simply excluding the odd connectivities , we thus find coding and decoding algorithms for the dense cubic connectivities .",
    "the coding of the general cubic connectivities including vacant positions then follows analogous to the case of the ` magnetic ' connectivities in ref .  .",
    "this coding allows one to divide the partition sum @xmath115 of the @xmath108-row system in contributions corresponding with different connectivities : @xmath116 next , we append a new row @xmath117 to the lattice : @xmath118 , and express the restricted partition sums @xmath119 as a linear combination of the @xmath120 .",
    "this is possible because the weight due to the newly appended row is completely determined by the bond variables connecting to the appended vertices and the ` old ' connectivity @xmath121 , and this information also determines the ` new ' connectivity @xmath122 .",
    "we use @xmath123 to denote the @xmath124 appended bond variables , and @xmath125 to denote the function that determines @xmath122 . the weight factor associated with",
    "the new row satisfies @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of appended bonds and @xmath128 is the number of loops closed by these bonds .",
    "the recursion connecting the restricted sums is @xmath129 in which the transfer matrix @xmath130 is defined by @xmath131 in actual calculations , the transfer matrix is represented as the product of @xmath106 sparse matrices , each of which appends one new vertex of the @xmath132-th row .",
    "the first vertex of a new row increases the number of dangling edges to @xmath133 , so that the sparse matrices assume a larger size than @xmath134 . after appending the last vertex of that row , the number of dangling edges decreases to @xmath106 .",
    "this technical point was described in some detail for the related case of the o(@xmath0 ) model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the sparse - matrix technique makes it unnecessary to store the full transfer matrix @xmath135 .",
    "some of its eigenvalues can be obtained by repeated multiplication of a vector by @xmath135 , and analysis of the resulting vector sequence . since @xmath134 is not symmetric in general , we used the method of projection to a hessenberg matrix as described in ref .  .",
    "we restricted the calculations to vectors with ` translation symmetry ' , i.e. , vectors that are invariant under a permutation of connectivities corresponding with a cyclic permutation of the dangling edges .",
    "in general , the largest eigenvalue @xmath136 determines the free energy @xmath137 per site in the limit of an infinitely long cylinder ( @xmath138 ) : @xmath139 furthermore , the next largest eigenvalues @xmath140",
    "( @xmath141 determine the correlation lengths @xmath142 of various types of correlation functions .",
    "the latter types depend on the symmetry of the corresponding eigenvector and on possible modifications of @xmath135 .",
    "in particular , the correlation length @xmath143 of the energy - energy correlation function is determined by the gap between the two largest eigenvalues : @xmath144    for the cubic model , magnetic correlations can be represented , in analogy with the o(@xmath0 ) model , by graphs with odd vertices on the correlated sites . for the present model that means sites connected to one or three bonds .",
    "the two correlated sites , which are placed far apart in the length direction of the cylinder , must be connected by the graph , i.e. , belong to the same component of the graph .",
    "this additional component does not follow the rules of ` evenness ' listed earlier .",
    "the number of dangling bonds at the open end of the cylinder ( between the correlated sites ) connecting to the additional odd vertex must be odd .",
    "to describe such ` magnetic ' graphs we define a new set of connectivities in which one group of connected dangling bonds is odd .",
    "this leads to a modified transfer matrix , which may alternatively be interpreted as the magnetic sector of a larger transfer matrix whose vector space includes both even and odd connectivities .",
    "the gap between @xmath145 and the largest eigenvalue @xmath146 in the magnetic sector determines the magnetic correlation length @xmath147 as @xmath148    a different type of magnetic gap is associated with the density of the loops spanning the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "the weight of these loops is modified by assigning a bond weight @xmath149 to one bond in each row .",
    "a loop spanning the circumference contains an odd number of these modified bonds , and its weight thus changes sign .",
    "all other loops contain an even number of modified bonds and their weights are thus unchanged .",
    "we denote the largest eigenvalue of the modified transfer matrix by @xmath150 .",

    "both magnetic length scales are related by duality , but this is not so for general @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding length scale is given by @xmath152 in the actual transfer - matrix calculations , we have used finite sizes up to @xmath153 in the nonmagnetic sector , which then has dimensionality 2004032 , and up to @xmath154 in the magnetic sector , which then has dimensionality 3856582 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic correlation length @xmath147 near a critical point can be expressed in terms of the scaled gap @xmath155 where @xmath156 parametrizes the distance to the critical point , and @xmath157 represents an irrelevant field .",

    "the present results extend the range of @xmath0 and provide additional evidence concerning the dimensions @xmath159 and @xmath212 .",
    "the numerical accuracy of our analysis is such that the o(@xmath0 ) universality of the cubic model seems reasonably convincing .",
    "we note that numerical results for the o(@xmath0 ) model on the square lattice @xcite are even more accurate ; however , for that case the exact critical point is known , and the cubic anisotropy field , and thereby the leading corrections to scaling , vanish .    this research is supported in part by the dutch fom foundation ( ` stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ' ) which is financially supported by the nwo ( ` nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek ' ) , by the national science foundation of china under grant # 10105001 , and by a grant from beijing normal university .",
