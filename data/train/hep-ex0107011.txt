    "the interest to research of chemical composition ( cc ) of primary cosmic ray ( pcr ) in energy area close to the knee of the energy spectrum ( @xmath1 ev ) does not require a reason and confirmation .",
    "it is enough to remind recent results of experiments : dice / casa - mia @xcite and hegra @xcite , that affirm essential fraction of light elements (  70 @xmath2 p+he ) or at least an absence of significant changes of cc ; casa - blanka @xcite and kascade @xcite , that observe thin structure in dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 ( a dip in knee area ) and , at last , kascade @xcite and casa - mia @xcite , declined to heavier mass composition of pcr in the knee region .",
    "alternative methods of pcr chemical composition research in the same energy area , based on data obtained by means of x - ray emulsion chambers ( ec ) , do not find out a growth of a fraction of heavy elements ( fe ) in pcr composition @xcite .",
    "only the part of heavy nuclei in pcr was studied in these and also in earlier works @xcite , using results of ec .    in the present work",
    "an attempt of selection of families generated by four different groups of nuclei ( p , he , middle and heavy nuclei ) and an estimation of their fraction in pcr are made .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that it is reasonable to use only three parameters of @xmath0-hadron families for research of chemical composition of primary cosmic rays .",
    "they are : @xmath5  -   the number of hadrons in a family , @xmath6  -  an average radius of @xmath0-component of the family and @xmath7  -  a ratio of `` initial '' to observed numbers of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "these parameters , on the one hand , are sensitive to the mass of an induced nucleus , and on the other , do not correlate with each other . in order to reduce the number of used parameters to one ( i.e.to turn the analysis to a one - dementional form , similar to the neural nets method ) it has been suggested @xcite to use one third of a sum of normalized parameters :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 in [ 2 ] @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are determined on the base of artificial families generated by protons . it has to be mentioned , that for simulation of families we use the mc0 model @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of x to the mass of generating nucleus is demonstrated on figure 1 , that shows its distributions for four groups of nuclei : p , he , middle nuclei and fe.the group of middle nuclei includes c , n , o , mg and si . the figure is drown for simulated @xmath0- families satisfying the same selection rules as experimental families ( see below ) .    the conditions used to select the families similar to those generated by the given nucleus `` p - like '' , `` he - like '' , `` mid - like '' , `` fe - like '' , are brought in table  [ tab1 ] .    .",
    "+ [ tab1 ]    .selection conditions of families [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab4 ] shows , that the fractions of families , generated by light nuclei at energies below the knee of pcr energy spectrum , remain high , while the middle and heavy nuclei within the error limits of estimations , are present in pcr as in the normal cc .",
    "in the present work we show that :    \\1 . @xmath0-hadron families allow their rather effective classification on groups of nuclei responsible for their generation and ,",
    "hence , they can be used for successful investigation of chemical composition of primary cosmic rays .",
    "analysis of @xmath0-hadron families brings to the conclusion that the chemical composition of primary cosmic radiation below the knee of its energy spectrum remains the normal or is displaced towards the light nuclei .",
