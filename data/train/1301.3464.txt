    "\\(iii ) as we can see in fig .",
    "[ 12interlayer ] , mc results with gp does not show the above - mentioned anomalous expansion up to 1150 k slightly above the surface melting temperature observed above with this potential",

    "( color online ) inter - layer @xmath68 computed with gupta and eam potentials . dashed line represents the bulk inter - layer distance .",

    "our computations are in agreement with leed results .",

    "we have found this with our simulations using eam potential at @xmath74 900 k. our expansion is about 5% at 1150 k , with respect to the bulk value .",
    "the disagreement between our mc result and md result using the same potential resides not only in the difference of surface melting temperatures ( ours is 700 k , the md one is 1100 k ) but also in the existence of the anomalous expansion .    for gp , we do not observe the anomalous expansion up to 11500 k as shown in fig .",
    "[ 12interlayer ] .",
    "so the existence or not of an anomalous expansion depends on the potential at least with our mc results .",

    "[ 12interlayer ] , at around 700 k , the melting of the first layer causes the apparition of a little peak but @xmath69 is still smaller than the bulk inter - layer distance .",
    "the fact that the anomalous expansion does not occur at the melting temperature of the first layer means that the melted surface is in a `` two - dimensional '' liquid state in the temperature region between 700 k and 900 k. this liquid surface layer is `` detached '' from the remaining crystal only at temperatures higher than 900 k. more accurate experiments of surface melting are desirable to allow a better understanding of this point .",
    "\\(ii ) with the gp : since the surface melts at @xmath75 k ( see fig . [ evt_g ] ) , if there is an anomalous expansion , this should happen at a higher temperature .",
    "given the fact that with eam , our mc result indicates the anomalous expansion occurring 200 k above the surface melting temperature , we can imagine the same scenario with the gp : an expansion may be possible at @xmath76 k , namely at the bulk melting .    to close this section ,",
    "let us summarize here that ( i ) the surface melting occurs below the bulk one , but the distance to the bulk melting temperature depends on the potential : the eam and gupta potentials give the same bulk melting temperature but different surface melting temperatures ( ii ) an anomalous dilatation of surface is possible only at a temperature much higher than the surface melting temperature .",
    "monte carlo simulations with both eam and gupta potentials show two different surface melting temperatures for the ( 111 ) surface of a silver sample : while both eam and gupta potentials give the same bulk melting temperature ( @xmath77 k ) , the eam potential yields a surface melting at @xmath0 k and the gupta potential shows a surface melting at @xmath75 k close to the bulk melting .",
    "however , both potentials show a contraction of the topmost inter - layer distance of that surface at low temperatures , in good agreement with experiments and theories .",
    "our results of the temperature - dependence of the inter - layer contraction indicate a strong potential - dependence : the variation of the contraction with increasing temperature shows a difference of the two potentials . using the eam potential ,",
    "our mc simulations show an anomalous thermal expansion , namely the distance between the topmost layers is larger than that between two adjacent bulk layers .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the anomalous thermal expansion occurs only at a temperature much higher than the surface melting temperature : the already - disordered surface layer is loosely attached to the crystal .",
    "this surface `` dilatation '' is in agreement with meis experiments and _ ab - initio _ dft calculations . on the other hand , using the gupta potential , our results show that the surface inter - layer distance varies with the temperature but it is always smaller than the bulk distance at least up to temperatures close to the bulk melting .",
    "we attribute the non observation of a surface dilatation in this case by the fact that surface melting occurs too close to the bulk melting .",
    "the high surface melting temperature has been found in md simulations with eam potential @xcite .",
    "the existence of surface dilatation has been observed in meis experiments @xcite but not in leed experiments @xcite and in x - ray scattering @xcite .",
    "we think that this difference comes in part from the difference of surface flatness , surface cleanness ( contaminated or not ) and experimental conditions .",
    "we hope that experimentalists could resolve this important question on anomalous high - temperature behavior of ag(111 ) .",
