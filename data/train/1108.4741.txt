    "quantum computers use entanglement to efficiently perform tasks thought to be intractable on classical computers . in one model of quantum computation ,",
    "called measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) @xcite , the entanglement is prepared in a system of many particles called a _ resource state _ before computation takes place .",
    "given this resource state , a quantum algorithm proceeds by performing adaptive , single - particle measurements , with classical processing of measurement outcomes .",
    "this approach is convenient for physical implementations because single - particle operations are usually less error prone than entangling ones .",
    "it is also a fruitful theoretical model to investigate computationally useful phases of matter which can be studied using well - established methods from many - body physics .",
    "if a resource state is to provide a quantum speed - up , it must have the right kind of entanglement @xcite .",
    "we call a resource _ universal _ @xcite if we can efficiently obtain the output of an arbitrary quantum computation by performing single - particle measurements on it",
    ". the canonical example of a universal resource is the cluster state @xcite .    while it is one thing to show that a resource is universal , for it to be viable we must also be able to prepare it efficiently and provide some shielding against errors .",
    "it is hoped that these properties can be found in natural interacting spin systems equipped with an energy gap .",
    "finding universal resources that are natural ground states is interesting in its own right , because it sheds some light on the intrinsic computational power of natural systems .",
    "unfortunately , the cluster state is not a natural ground state .",
    "in fact , it is impossible to have a universal resource of spin-1/2 particles that is the unique ground state of a frustration - free hamiltonian with only two particle interactions @xcite .",
    "however , this negative result does not hold for higher level systems .",
    "for example , a gapped hamiltonian with two - body interactions involving essentially 8-dimensional systems ( on a honeycomb lattice ) or 16-dimensional systems ( on a square lattice ) can produce ground states that are universal resources @xcite .",
    "moreover , the tri - cluster state @xcite on spin-5/2 particles is the ground state of a frustration - free , two - body hamiltonian and is a universal resource for mbqc .",
    "however , the hamiltonians of both of these models lack natural symmetries .",
    "resources with more natural interactions based on the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state ( which we define in sec .",
    "[ s : modeldefs ] ) , have also been found .",
    "these models are two - body , rotationally symmetric and heisenberg - like .",
    "the one - dimensional aklt state on a chain @xcite , while not universal , can be used to implement single qubit unitaries .",
    "theoretical constructions based on the aklt state by cai",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite and li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were shown to be universal , the latter working at non - zero temperature with always - on interactions .",
    "finally , the two - dimensional aklt state on a trivalent lattice is universal @xcite .",
    "a potential difficulty with these approaches is that requiring an exact hamiltonian to produce a ground state is not robust : a physical hamiltonian will be perturbed from the ideal one to some degree .",
    "hence a phase that is universal , rather than a specific ground state , is a more realistic computational resource .",
    "the computational power of certain cluster state phases have been studied @xcite .",
    "in addition , the more natural spin-1 haldane phase can be used as a resource to perform single qubit unitary operations  @xcite , but not arbitrary quantum computations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the computational power of ground states in a spin-3/2 phase of matter originally studied by niggemann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which includes the 2d aklt state .",
    "we find that a large portion of the phase has ground states that are universal resources , following similar methods to  @xcite .",
    "the phase has several interesting points including a unique point where only projective measurements ( as opposed to general povm measurements ) are necessary , and a transition in computational power that coincides with the phase boundary .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : modeldefs ]",
    "we describe the spin-3/2 model defined in @xcite .",
    "the computational power of this model is explored in section [ s : mbqcmethod ] by generalising methods used for the 2d aklt state @xcite . in section [",
    "s : significant ] , we highlight significant features in model from the perspective of mbqc .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "consider a collection of spin-3/2 particles on a honeycomb lattice interacting via the hamiltonian @xmath0 where the sum is over each pair of nearest neighbours and @xmath1 projects nearest neighbours @xmath2 and @xmath3 onto the seven dimensional subspace of total spin @xmath4 .",
    "we will call this model the 2d aklt model after the authors affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki who originally proposed it @xcite .",
    "the aklt model can be thought of as a deformation of the heisenberg model @xmath5 that preserves full rotational symmetry .",
    "note , however , that unlike the 1d case , the aklt model and the heisenberg model are not in the same phase : the heisenberg model has a nel ordered ground state , while the aklt model does not .",
    "thus the aklt model is said to be in a disordered phase .",
    "the absence of nel order makes it a more realistic model for certain systems , e.g. bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8 , which is a spin-3/2 antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice without nel order @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the aklt model @xmath9 , which we will call the 2d aklt state , is a valence - bond solid , or projected entangled pair state ( peps ) .",
    "details of the peps construction of ground states are included in appendix [ s : pepsgroundstate ] .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a 5-parameter deformation of the 2d aklt hamiltonian which is frustration free and whose ground state is a one - parameter deformation of the aklt peps ( see appendix [ s : pepsgroundstate ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is still two - body nearest neighbour with summands that preserve two @xmath10 symmetries , parity and spin flip , however it breaks full rotational symmetry to a @xmath11 symmetry ( arbitrary rotations about the @xmath12-axis ) .",

    "importantly , the ground state of @xmath21 depends only on @xmath18 and the ground state of @xmath22 is @xmath9 .",
    "the fully rotationally invariant interaction , @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) , corresponds to the choice of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 . with periodic boundary conditions or with open boundaries and heisenberg interactions between spin-1/2 particles and the edges ,",
    "the ground state @xmath26 is unique for @xmath27 and can be obtained simply by applying the inverse deformation to the 2d aklt state @xmath28 using monte carlo sampling , niggemann et .",
    "al @xcite found the ground states had exponentially decaying correlation functions below a critical value of @xmath29 , while were nel ordered above this value .",
    "thus , hamiltonians in the @xmath30 region are conjectured to be gapped , while hamiltonians in the @xmath31 region are gapless @xcite",
    ". we will refer to the appearance of nel order at @xmath29 as the phase transition in this model .",
    "we will label the region @xmath32 as the aklt phase , and the region @xmath31 as the nel ordered phase .",
    "note that the area law for entanglement holds across this phase transition ( peps dimension is constant ) , a property that can only occur in peps on graphs of dimension greater than one @xcite .",
    "we also note that schuch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied classes of peps related by this type of symmetry - preserving deformation .",
    "in this section we will look at how ground states in the aklt phase ( as defined above ) can be used for mbqc . to do this we generalise the existing method used at the aklt point @xcite , which we will briefly review .",
    "the 2d aklt state has been shown to be a universal resource for measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "we will summarize the procedure for measurement - based quantum computing on the 2d aklt state by breaking it into two stages : reducing to a stochastic graph state , then using this graph state for computation .",
    "the first stage relies on the principle of quantum state reduction @xcite , where a resource is shown to be universal by proving that it can be converted into a known universal resource efficiently by single - particle measurement .",
    "a three - outcome filtering measurement is performed on every particle .",
    "define @xmath33 to be the spin-3/2 state satisfying @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spin-3/2 component along the @xmath36 axis , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the measurement operators for the initial filtering are chosen to be @xmath39 where @xmath40    these operators satisfy the completion relation @xmath41 and thus form a valid set of measurement operators , i.e. , @xmath42 is a povm @xcite .",
    "the measurement , applied globally , projects each spin-3/2 system onto a two dimensional , or qubit , subspace .",
    "we label each particle either @xmath43 , @xmath44 , or @xmath45 according to the outcome of this measurement .",
    "the resulting collection of spin-3/2 particles encodes a graph state , which can be proven using the stabilizer formalism  @xcite or by using a tensor network description  @xcite .",
    "the graph state is encoded as follows ( we have illustrated the encoding in fig .  [",
    "f : outcomestographstate ] ) .",
    "a _ domain _ is defined as a connected set of particles with the same label .",
    "each domain encodes a single qubit in the graph state .",
    "an edge exists between two encoded qubits if an odd number of bonds ( in the original honeycomb lattice ) connect the corresponding domains .",
    "we remark that the reduction of 2d aklt state via a three - outcome povm to a stochastic graph state is similar to the reduction of the tri - cluster state to a graph state described in @xcite , however the graphs produced in the latter are deterministic .      in the second stage of this method",
    ", the stochastic graph state is used for mbqc .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , arbitrary quantum computations may be performed by first converting the post - filter graph state into a cluster state on a square lattice , which is itself a universal resource @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in ref .",
    "@xcite , ` backbone ' paths are identified through the graph state along which correlation space qubits can propagate and interact , again enabling universal quantum computation .",
    "essentially , both approaches use a stochastic graph state as a resource . whether this is possible depends on the stochastic graph states having certain desirable properties .",
    "we will show how the same approach can be applied to deformed aklt states .      here",
    "we generalize the above method to show how deformed 2d aklt states can be reduced to stochastic graph states using a modified version of the @xmath46 measurement . for @xmath47",
    "( we will consider the @xmath48 case in section [ s : mysteryregion ] ) we define three measurement operators as @xmath49 numerical prefactors are included to ensure that @xmath50 .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , like @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , are projections onto qubit subspaces , up to a constant factor .",
    "the reduction procedure involves performing this measurement on every particle of the deformed ground state @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting state after subjecting every particle of the deformed aklt state @xmath26 to a povm measurement @xmath58 is equivalent to the state obtained by measuring the undeformed state @xmath9 using the povm @xmath46 and getting the same outcomes , up to local unitaries .",
    "thus we can apply the existing methods in section [ s : usingstochastic ] to resulting stochastic graph states away from the aklt point .",
    "however the success of these methods depends on the stochastic graph states having certain properties .",
    "the statistics that determine these properties are dependent on the value of @xmath18 , as we will explain in the following section .",
    "because each particle is measured with a three - outcome povm , the total number of possible outcomes is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of spin-3/2 particles .",
    "some of these outcomes correspond to computationally useful graph states ( e.g.  if every domain had size one ) , while some will not ( e.g.  if every measurement outcome was @xmath45 ) .",
    "let @xmath61 be a sequence of filter outcomes where @xmath62 is the filter outcome on spin @xmath2 and is either @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "at the aklt point it was shown in @xcite that the probability of obtaining a particular @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of domains for a given outcome , @xmath66 is the number of inter - domain bonds before deleting edges in the reduction to a graph state , and @xmath67 is a normalisation factor . a typical filter outcome , sampled from this distribution , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : akltreductiontypical ] .",
    "+    in appendix [ s : distribution ] we explain how to use eq .   to compare the norms ( hence probabilities ) of the post - filter states at @xmath68 to those at @xmath24 .",
    "the probability of obtaining a particular filter outcome @xmath63 with deformation @xmath18 is @xmath69 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are as above , @xmath70 is the total number of @xmath45 filter outcomes .",
    "these statistics are equivalent to a potts - like spin model in the canonical ensemble @xmath71 where the @xmath72 term is the potts hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath73 is a non - local cluster counting term similar to the random cluster model @xcite , @xmath74 is an external field term with strength @xmath75 , and the inverse temperature @xmath76 is constant .",
    "this shows that varying @xmath18 to deform the aklt model is like varying an external magnetic field in terms of the statistics of the filter outcomes .      here",
    "we will show that , beyond the aklt point at @xmath24 , there is a range of @xmath18 values that have universal ground states .",
    "the reduction process in section [ s : generalizedreduction ] produces stochastic graph states with statistics given by eq . .",
    "for some filter outcomes it is possible to convert the stochastic graph state to a cluster state on a honeycomb lattice , which is itself a universal resource @xcite",
    ". a ground state at a given value of @xmath18 is universal if we can reduce it to a honeycomb cluster state efficiently , i.e. , if we can produce honeycomb cluster states of size @xmath60 from a ground state with @xmath77 particles in @xmath77 time .",
    "there are two conditions that will ensure this is possible @xcite :    1 .",
    "the maximum domain size scales no faster than logarithmically with the lattice size ; 2 .   the probability of the stochastic graph state having a crossing ( a path of edges connecting opposite boundaries of the graph ) tends to one in the limit of large @xmath60 .",
    "condition 1 ensures that producing graph states with an arbitrary number of qubits is possible .",
    "it also rules out the possibility of an macroscopic domain , which would produce star - shaped graphs states ( see fig .",
    "[ f : graphsamples]c for an example that is not universal for mbqc ) .",
    "if condition 1 is satisfied then condition 2 will imply the existence of a extensive number of crossings in both lattice dimensions , which guarantees the existence of a honeycomb subgraph @xcite , and hence the universality of the state .",
    "we performed monte carlo sampling over the distribution to determine which values of @xmath18 correspond to ground states satisfying these two conditions .",
    "we performed simulations on lattices of varying size up to @xmath78 spins .",
    "details of the numerical methods used are provided in appendix  [ s : monte ] .",
    "samples of resulting graph states are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : graphsamples ] .",
    "we found that maximum domain sizes scale logarithmically in the region @xmath79 while a macroscopic ( of extensive size ) domain appears at @xmath80 .",
    "the scaling of maximum domain size at selected values of @xmath18 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : maxcluster ] and the probability of obtaining a macroscopic domain as a function of @xmath18 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : percolation ] for various lattice sizes .    to assess condition 2 , we directly checked for the existence of a crossing of the resulting stochastic graph state .",
    "we found numerically that the resulting graphs have crossings with probability one for lattices of size @xmath81 and larger ( up to @xmath78 , the limit of our simulations ) , for all values of @xmath18 .",
    "our conclusion is that there is computationally powerful region that ends at @xmath82 , the upper limit corresponding to the boundary between the aklt phase and the nel phase .    due to",
    "the presence of a macroscopic domain of filter outcomes , our method for mbqc fails for @xmath31 , however we havent ruled out the possibility that ground states in this region can be used as computational resources using another method .",
    "however , the universality of such ground states is unlikely as ground states above the critical point of @xmath29 are nel ordered . while states with long range order are usually expected to not be universal for mbqc , we warn that exceptions have been found @xcite .",
    "in this section we will highlight significant features of the model characterised by particular values of @xmath18 .      at @xmath83",
    "we have the aklt state .",
    "this point is optimal in the sense that it produces graph states with the most qubits .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath85 the inverse deformation @xmath86 tends towards a projection onto the space spanned by @xmath87 resulting in a ghz ground state @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "any measurement sequence on this state can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "note that @xmath92 and therefore the filtering measurement in eq .   at @xmath91",
    "has only two outcomes , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we define the orthonormal basis @xmath95 then we can write @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which are projections onto orthogonal spaces . hence the @xmath91 ground state is special in that it requires only projective measurements to be universal for mbqc .      the filtering measurement in eq .",
    "is not well - defined for @xmath98 . here",
    "we will provide a casual analysis of how states within region may be useful .",
    "for @xmath98 we define a new measurement with the operators @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 outcomes produce graph state qubits as before , however @xmath101 outcomes must be treated separately . when @xmath102 is very slightly less than 1 , the state will be like the @xmath91 state except for a few isolated @xmath101 sites . at an @xmath101 site we can measure surrounding @xmath43 and @xmath44 qubits in a disentangling basis ( corresponding to a @xmath45 cluster state measurement ) , effectively disentangling @xmath101 sites from the others .",
    "however , as we decrease @xmath18 towards zero , the number of @xmath101 outcomes increases , and eventually we can not cut them out of the lattice without adversely affecting the connectivity of the graph .",
    "hence we predict a critical value of @xmath103 below which this measurement produces states that are not universal for mbqc . we leave a detailed analysis of the @xmath103 region to future investigation .",
    "in summary , we have studied the computational power of a spin-3/2 aklt phase that preserves @xmath11 and @xmath10 symmetries @xcite . by mapping measurement outcomes to a classical spin model we identified three regions : a region with ground states that are universal resources ( @xmath104 ) , a region that is unlikely to be computationally powerful ( @xmath105 ) , and a region that we can not say much about ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "significant points include the 2d aklt state ( @xmath83 ) , a state which requires only projective measurements ( @xmath91 ) , a ghz state ( @xmath84 ) and the phase transition ( @xmath29 ) which corresponds to a transition in computational power . while it is an open question whether or not this quantum computational phase is gapped , it is known that the ground state for @xmath107 with periodic boundaries ( or open boundaries with heisenberg interactions with qubits on the boundaries ) is unique @xcite .",
    "any size dependent gap in the disordered phase would be expected to scale at worst as an inverse polynomial in system size @xmath60 .",
    "a practical limitation of the method is that it depends on precise knowledge of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "performing the procedure with an assumed value of @xmath18 that differs from that of the actual ground state will yield a resource state that differs from the cluster state .",
    "the effect will be that @xmath43 and @xmath44 outcomes cause errors in the correlation space in which the computation takes place ( @xmath45 outcomes , however , are error free ) .",
    "it is not even clear that these errors can be corrected using standard techniques , as they may not correspond to linear completely - positive trace - preserving maps on the correlation space @xcite .",
    "whether there exists a method that is independent of the exact value of the deformation , analogous to @xcite , remains to be seen .",
    "another question is if other deformations to the 2d aklt model ( e.g.  ones that preserve full rotational symmetry ) yield computationally powerful ground states .",
