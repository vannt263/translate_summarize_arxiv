    "the process of high harmonic generation ( hhg ) has been studied extensively @xcite in the past several decades , which has become one of the most important research areas in ultrafast atomic and molecular physics .",
    "hhg has been a tabletop coherent x - ray source .",
    "it can be used to generate attosecond ( 1 as=10@xmath1 s ) laser pulses @xcite , image molecular structures @xcite , and so on .",
    "whereas , because of the high nonlinearity of the hhg process @xcite , the intensity of generated harmonics is still too low , which limits the applications of hhg .",
    "recently , experiments @xcite showed that hhg can be generated from bulk crystals .",
    "due to high density of solid materials , it is possible to produce hhg with higher efficiency .",
    "in addition , by analysis of the spectra of hhg , it may be possible to study internal structures of solid materials .",
    "hhg in solids is generally considered to involve two contributions : interband and intraband currents .",
    "recent experiments @xcite revealed that electron - hole recollision leads to the interband current , while intraband current is thought as a result of bloch oscillations @xcite in the same band .",
    "both processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "et al_. @xcite suggested that laser - driven bloch oscillations of an electron wave packet on a single conduction lead to current .",
    "et al_. @xcite suggested that a primary plateau is due to the coupling of the valence band to the first conduction band and a weaker second plateau is due to coupling to higher - lying conduction bands .",
    "2-band and 3-band models are calculated by mcdonald",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that the first plateau arises from electron - hole recollision , while the higher plateaus arise from interband bloch oscillations .    until now , there are two main theoretical models : the many - electron model and the single - electron model .",
    "the former is based on the semiconductor bloch equation ( sbe ) @xcite , which has been successfully applied in solids and semiconductor physics , such as semiconductor excitons , many - body correlations @xcite . however , it has limitations . due to the interactions between electrons in solids ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain accurate solutions to many - electron systems . on the other hand",
    ", it may take a long time to solve the related problems .",
    "the single - electron model exhibits its advantages in addressing electron dynamics in solids .",
    "it is based on energy - band theory , which treats motions of each electron in solids independently in an effective potential . for ideal crystals ,",
    "atoms are arranged in a regular rule , which shows periodicity .",
    "as long as the effective potential is determined , the related problems can be solved directly .    in this work ,",
    "we use b - spline basis functions to solve the single - electron time - dependent schrdinger equations ( tdse ) in coordinate space by using periodic potentials to simulate hhg processes in solids .",
    "inter- and intra- band transitions , cutoff dependence , and carrier envelope phase ( cep ) effects in short laser pulses are studied .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we review the theoretical framework and exhibit results by comparing different methods . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , we show numerical simulations for hhg in short pulses .",
    "we conclude our work in sec .",
    "our theoretical method is based on the single active electron model , we describe the laser - crystal interaction in one - dimensional systems with laser polarization in the crystal plane . in the length gauge ,",
    "the time dependent hamiltonian is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a periodic potential of the lattice . in our calculations ,",

    "[ fig1 ] . as we know",
    "the bloch - state basis is widely used in periodic systems and can be expanded in plane waves .",
    "all calculations based on it can be performed in wave vector @xmath0 space , and the integral of currents involves the whole first brillouin zone .",
    "in contrast , we use b - spline basis to perform all calculations in coordinate space , in which the periodic property is not explicit in basis .",
    "however , calculations in coordinate space and wave vector space are equivalent . to demonstrate it",
    ", we also plot the energy bands obtained by the bloch - state expansion in @xmath0 space , comparing the results obtained by the b - spline method described above .",
    "one may find that the number of bands , the width of the bands and band gaps agree well with each other . in our coordinate space method ,",
    "the wave vector is not explicit .",
    "however , it can be easily extracted by fast fourier transformation ( fft ) of the eigenfunction .",
    "we choose arbitrarily an eigenfunction and transform it from coordinate space to wave vector space by fft .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) that one eigenstate corresponds to two wave vectors , which agrees well with the bloch - state expansion @xcite .    in the laser fields , electrons oscillating in the valence band",
    "have probabilities to tunnel to conduction bands .",
    "because tunnelling probabilities are related to the energy gap , only a small portion populated near @xmath0=0 in band 2 can tunnel from valence to conduction bands with the laser parameters used in the current work .",
    "so we choose an initial state calculated by our b - spline method with @xmath0=0 in band 2 with the smallest band gap .",
    "its fft is illustrated in fig .",
