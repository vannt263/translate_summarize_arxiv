    "the production of quantum degenerate gases has revolutionized the field of atomic physics .",
    "such gases are now routinely used as a means towards understanding complex many - body quantum phenomena from the realms of condensed matter and nuclear physics @xcite . as atom sources with precisely controlled properties , these gases can also significantly advance applications such as atom interferometry @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite . while the production and measurement methods of quantum gas experiments are well established , the measurement rate remains substantially limited by the lack of a general method for rapid sample production .",
    "cycle times for such experiments are dominated by the production time , typically tens of seconds , while the actual experiment on the prepared sample lasts for about a second before destructive measurement .",
    "this separation of timescales is a severe impediment to the employment of quantum degenerate gases towards precision devices such as atomic clocks , inertial sensors and gravimeters @xcite .",
    "bridging these timescales can significantly contribute to all classes of quantum gas explorations and applications , as most measurements rely on the statistics of results from many experimental iterations .",
    "the root of this timescale problem lies in the speed of collisional evaporative cooling . in a standard",
    "degenerate gas production sequence , the initial step of laser cooling produces temperatures in the few tens of @xmath5k , while light - induced processes keep the density below @xmath6@xmath7 . the resulting phase space density ( psd ) of @xmath8",
    "is increased to quantum degeneracy by subsequent evaporative cooling in either magnetic or optical traps .",
    "typical magnetic traps have large volumes and relatively low initial densities , yielding low collision rates and long evaporative cooling timescales of tens of seconds .",
    "the production of becs in small - volume magnetic chip traps has provided one solution to the timescale problem @xcite .",
    "while this method has recently achieved cycle times of one second with @xmath9rb @xcite , it can only be applied to magnetic atoms .",
    "optical dipole traps ( odts)@xcite provide the flexibility to cool all atoms , enabling applications with non - magnetic atoms and liberating the magnetic degree of freedom for interaction control during cooling @xcite .",
    "standard odts have small volumes and high collision rates , leading to smaller atom numbers but shorter evaporation timescales in the range of a few to @xmath10s .",
    "an overall bec production time as low as @xmath11s has been accomplished in an odt @xcite by combining one broad and one very narrow transition for laser cooling in @xmath12sr , to realize an extremely high initial psd of @xmath13 before evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "a bec production time of @xmath14s was achieved in @xmath9rb by combining sub - doppler laser cooling to a high initial psd of @xmath15 with fast evaporative cooling in an odt in which the volume was dynamically compressed by a moving lens @xcite .",
    "these methods however are not easily adaptable in a general way to other atomic species and experimental setups .",
    "in this paper we present a general technique for rapid quantum degenerate gas production , where evaporative cooling is optimized by dynamically controlling the odt shape with the time - averaged potential of a single rapidly - moving laser beam .",
    "this method straightforwardly allows for large initial and small final trap volumes , combining the advantages of earlier evaporative cooling strategies .",
    "it is applicable to all atoms and requires no hardware beyond a standard optical trapping setup .",
    "applied to bosonic @xmath0yb with modest laser cooling to psds @xmath16 , our experiment produces becs containing @xmath17 atoms with an overall cycle time of @xmath18s . by suitably altering the time dependence of the trap parameters , we also produce large @xmath0yb becs with @xmath19 atoms .",

    "the reality of other loss processes tempers this idea and introduces a new timescale which competes with that of evaporative cooling .",
    "this competition outlines an important experimental challenge and is captured by the ratio of  good \" to  bad \" collisions @xmath39 .",

    "importantly , this prescription simultaneously improves the speed of evaporative cooling and final particle number . in an odt , while 3-body processes can be neglected in certain situations @xcite , it is often the dominant loss mechanism .",
    "then @xmath44 , and @xmath38 and @xmath40 can not be simultaneously optimized .",
    "crucially , unlike in 1-body loss dominated systems , the inverted scaling of @xmath40 with density means maintaining a large @xmath45 leads to lowered @xmath42 , reduced collision rates and longer evaporation timescales .",
    "numerical modeling of evaporative cooling in an odt @xcite can help optimize @xmath38 , but the challenges of large number and speed remain .",
    "our solution to these challenges involves the implementation of the time - averaged optical potential of a laser beam moving rapidly , or  painting \" , in one dimension . the ability to dynamically control the center position modulation ( cpm ) amplitude of the beam in addition to its total power , results in independent , arbitrary control over both the trap depth ( @xmath46 ) and frequency as a function of time , a key advantage over methods with a fixed power - law relationship between @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "the largest cpm amplitude used is 260 @xmath5 m ( 520 @xmath5 m peak - to - peak ) , and corresponds to shifting the center frequency of the aom by 7 mhz ( 14 mhz peak - to - peak ) on top of 80 mhz .",
