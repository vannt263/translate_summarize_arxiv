    "disordered and random systems play a fundamental role in a broad range of research fields .",
    "early works concentrated on the spectra of complex atomic nuclei , which could be described by random hamiltonians , and led to the development of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite . due to the quantum mechanical effect of level repulsion combined with universality",
    ", rmt leads to the famous wigner - dyson distribution of level spacings  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , such level distributions depend only on the symmetries of the system .",
    "the connection to solid state physics has been made in the context of localization  @xcite , small particles  @xcite and mesoscopic effects like weak localization or conductance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , much less works have addressed the spectral properties near a gap in the spectrum , which is especially relevant in superconducting systems  @xcite . here , the universal fluctuations have been predicted as well  @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed numerically for proximity systems  @xcite .",
    "so - called andreev billiards have henceforth provided an important playground to test general chaotic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the superconducting proximity effect in general describes the physical properties of normal , non - superconducting conductors in close electronic contact to a superconductor . in this way",
    ", an otherwise normal structure can show the key features of superconductivity , such as perfect diamagnetism , a supercurrent or a spectral gap  @xcite .",
    "particularly the induced gap and its phase - dependence has attracted attention from theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite side . in the long junction limit @xmath0 with the superconducting coherence length @xmath1 , the gap scales in a metal of size @xmath2 is universally the thouless energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the diffusion constant and @xmath5 being the dwell time inside the normal metal .",
    "the induced gap is called the `` minigap '' , since in the long junction regime it is usually much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath6 , though in practical realizations this is not always the case . in particular le sueur and coworkers",
    "@xcite have measured the phase - dependent local density of states in a diffusive wire between superconducting contacts and found an excellent agreement with the theory based on quasiclassical greens functions .",
    "the size of the minigap depends in a characteristic way on the phase difference and closes for a phase difference of @xmath7 .    on the microscopic level , the electronic connection between superconductor and a normal metal stupilates the process of andreev reflection  @xcite , in which an electron - like quasiparticle is converted into a cooper pair leaving behind an hole - like quasiparticle",
    "this coherent processes can occur for energies below the superconducting gap @xmath6 and results in the presence of superconducting correlations in the normal metal . for a finite - size normal metal or a junction between two superconductors subsequent andreev processes form andreev bound states ( abss ) .",
    "these bound states depend on the phase difference @xmath8 between the superconducting order parameters and , hence , carry a superconducting current .",
    "this is the microscopic origin of the josephson effects .",
    "the discrete abs have been detected by tunneling spectroscopy in carbon nanotube quantum dots  @xcite and microwave spectroscopy in atomic point contacts  @xcite .",
    "these observations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and confirm the microscopic relation between phase - dependent andreev states and the josephson effect .    in view of the history of the superconducting proximity effect both in theory and experiment",
    ", one would expect that everything is known already at least on the qualitative level .",
    "hence , it came as a complete surprise that reutlinger _",
    "et al . _ have reported a secondary gap in the spectrum just below the edge to the continuum in a short josephson junction made from a chaotic cavity connected to two superconductors  @xcite . due to the peculiar phase dependence of the secondary gap , which closes for some critical phase difference",
    ", it was termed smile gap and found to be parametrically related to the ( small ) factor @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the presence or absence of the smile gap was related to the distribution of the transmission probabilities of the two contacts connecting the cavity to the two superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the smile gap is present if the transmission distribution of each contact is gapped at small transmissions , that is , there is a lower boundary for transmission eigenvalues .",
    "the fact that the smile gap is robust against distortions of the transmission distributions and/or the formation of multiple cavities suggests a universal mechanism for the formation of the smile gap in systems of cavities connected to superconductors .",
    "more recently the focus of research has moved towards multi - terminal superconducting devices . a particular path - breaking prediction by riwar and coworkers  @xcite was the realization of weyl - type topological matter .",
    "the weyl singularities can be engineered artificially in systems consisting of a quantum coherent conductor connected to at least four superconducting terminals .",
    "it is interesting to note that three terminals are insufficient to create topological points , but still provide interesting physics  @xcite .",
    "the potential of engineering weyl singularities in multi - terminal josephson junctions  @xcite is still at its infancy and many interesting possibilities need to be explored .",
    "thus , the fundamental properties of these systems need to be investigated , which we will address in this paper .",
    "many properties of josephson junctions rely on the presence and properties of abss , which are phase - dependent and current - carrying states connected to at least two superconducting terminals .",
    "such states are described by a surprisingly simple formula , derived by beenakker  @xcite .",
    "the abss are represented by scattering matrices of electrons and holes propagating through the non - superconducting part of the junction .",
    "the transport characteristics of this normal region determines the properties of the abss and the josephson current .",
    "andreev reflection at the superconductors , which converts electrons into holes and vice versa , can also be expressed in terms of scattering matrices .",
    "the combination of all scattering matrices results in an eigenvalue problem for the energies of abss , which is known as beenakker s formula  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforwardly extended to multi - terminal junctions for our purposes .    in this paper , we study a particular multi - terminal josephson junction based on a ring structure formed by connecting four chaotic cavities with a big number of channels to each other and to four superconducting terminals .",
    "we nickname it a 4t - ring . despite the fact that the setup looks rather specific",
    ", we argue that the device illustrates interesting and general properties of the abs in multi - terminal junctions .",
    "the 4t - ring can be experimentally realized in either 2d gas semiconducting heterostructures or in graphene .",
    "we approach the abs spectrum in two complementary ways .",
    "one way is to use semiclassical green s functions and quantum circuit theory  @xcite , which leads to a continuous density of abs energies below the superconducting gap @xmath10 rather than a discrete spectrum .",
    "we focus on the density of states at @xmath11 and reveal the presence of proximity gaps and gapless regions in the spectrum , as well as smile gaps .",
    "the green s function approach allows for the definition of topological numbers , which distinguish the gapped and gapless regions in the 3d space of superconducting phases .",
    "a complementary formulation is beenakker s determinat equation  @xcite for a random scattering matrix with a large number of channels , allowing for the evaluation of individual abs energies .",
    "it explicitly demonstrates the gapped structure of the andreev spectrum .",
    "both the proximity and smile gaps are consistent with quantum circuit theory calculationes .",
    "we reveal the topology based on the gaps in the transmission distributions of individual cavities and explain the smile gaps with it .",
    "in addition , the scattering matrix approach enables us to artificially break the gap in the transmission distribution by injecting a single transmission eigenvalue into this gap .",
    "we demonstrate that this results in stray levels within the smile gaps .",
    "we observe that the andreev spectrum in our system is crucially tuned by the ratio of conductances , or conduction channels , in the ring structure and in the contacts attaching to the superconductors",
    ". if the conductances to the terminals are much larger than those in the ring ( open limit ) , the spectrum forms bunches with a finite number of andreev levels , equal to the number of channels in the internal connector .",
    "the bunches are localized between adjacent terminals and follow the phase differences of the involved superconductors .",
    "the crossings between bunches are classified into two types , their properties can be understood from a perturbative treatment for the degenerate levels .",
    "we investigate the visibility of wiggle - like fluctuations in the abs phase dependence that stems from the general predictions of rmt for our disordered system .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec : setup ] , we describe the setup of the 4t - ring using quantum circuit theory as well as the scattering matrix approach . in section [ sec :",
    "overview ] , we give an overview of the andreev spectrum based on both descriptions , explain the limiting cases , formulate the topologies and explain their applications in understanding the spectrum . section [ sec : openlimit ] is devoted to a specific discussion of the spectral details in the open limit , where we develop and apply a perturbation theory for the crossings of level bunches and investigate the fine structure of the bunches .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the design of the 4t - ring , and its description in the languages of quantum circuit theory and scattering matrices .",
    "( @xmath12 ) indicates the superconducting phase in the terminal @xmath13",
    ". a challenge might be the realization of the central gate , that has to be contacted without disturbing the other connections . ]    the nano - device we propose and discuss throughout the article is a hybrid superconducting - normal metal heterostructure .",
    "there are four independent superconducting leads coming to the structure , which serve as superconducting terminals , numbered with @xmath14 .",
    "the normal metal part consists of four chaotic cavities .",
    "each cavity is connected with a corresponding terminal by a ballistic contact encompassing @xmath15 transport channels .",
    "in addition , the cavities are connected to each other by ballistic contacts to form a ring - structure . the number of transport channels in the contact between the cavities @xmath13 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",

    ", we call this device a 4t - ring",
    ". a sketch of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : design ] .",
    "the design of the device is robust against inevitable imperfections of fabrication .",
    "there is an additional contact resistance between the normal part and the superconductors : yet it can be disregarded provided it is much smaller than the resistance of the ballistic contact .",
    "the cavities are assumed to be fully chaotic and thus described by scattering matrices taken from the circular ensemble of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",
    "the origin of chaoticity can be either due to impurity scattering inside the cavity or due to scattering at the boundaries in an otherwise ballistic system with a rather arbitrary shape . in both cases the resistance of the cavity interior must be much smaller than the resistance of the point pontacts .",
    "we assume the short structure limit , that is , the electron dwell time inside the structure is shorter than @xmath20 , @xmath6 being the superconducting energy gap in the leads .",
    "this is known to be equivalent to the assumption of no energy - dependence of the scattering matrix of the structure at a scale of @xmath6 , which permits efficient numerical calculations of the energy spectrum of excitations in the structure .",
    "we assume the superconducting leads made of the same metal . in this case",
    ", the superconducting order parameters in the terminals @xmath21 have the same absolute value @xmath22 , but in general different phases @xmath23 .",
    "since physical effects depend only on phase - differences , one phase can be chosen to @xmath19 , which gives three parameters governing the spectrum in the device .",
    "experimentally the device can be realized on the basis of a semiconductor heterostructure supporting a 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at its interface , for instance , on the basis of gaas / algaas heterostructures . in ballistic 2degs point contacts of ideal transmission",
    "have been realized  @xcite and furthermore these systems can be coupled to superconducting leads , allowing for an investigation of the proximity effect  @xcite , where the importance of sufficiently transparent interfaces between the superconductor and the 2deg has been outlined .    a sketch of an idea for a experimental realization using a 2deg is shown in fig .  [ fig : design ] .",
    "the big yellow regions are the superconducting leads , the red , blurry region sketches the 2deg within the normal part of the structure .",
    "gates are used to form the cavities with point - contacts between each other and towards the superconductors with a variable number of channels .",
    "an experimental challenge might be the central gate , which must be contacted from the back of the sample or an isolated electrode contacted by an air - bridge technique  @xcite . by varying the gate voltages ,",
    "the number of modes in each contact can be controlled separately .",
    "the superconducting phase - differences of the leads can be controlled by superconducting loop structures ( not shown in the plot ) , where a magnetic flux can be used to adjust the phase differences .",
    "an alternative idea is to make a device on the basis of a graphene flake  @xcite .",

    "the nanostructure is separated into nodes , terminals , and connectors . a matrix voltage ( a matrix @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) is defined in each node and terminal of the structure .",
    "the connectors are characterized by the distribution of transmission eigenvalues , and the matrix currents in the connectors are expressed in terms of matrix voltages at the ends of the connector . the matrix voltages in the terminals are fixed .",
    "the matrix voltages in the nodes are found from matrix current conservation  kirchoff rules  in the nodes .",
    "these kirchoff rules can be obtained from the extremization of an action @xmath31 that is contributed by each connector of the nanostructure and is a function of matrix voltages  @xcite .    for the 4t - ring ,",

    "<S> we consider the spectrum of andreev bound states ( abss ) in an exemplary 4-terminal superconducting structure where 4 chaotic cavities are connected by quantum point contacts to the terminals and to each other forming a ring . </S>",
    "<S> we nickname the resulting device _ 4t - ring_. such a tunable device can be realized in a 2d electron gas - superconductor or a graphene - based hybrid structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the limit of a short structure and large conductance of the point contacts where there are many abs in the device forming a quasi - continuous spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the abs can be tuned by changing the superconducting phases of the terminals . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the opening and closing of gaps in the spectrum upon changing the phases . </S>",
    "<S> this concerns the usual proximity gap that separates the levels from zero energy as well as less usual `` smile '' gaps that split the levels of the quasi - continuous spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a remarkable crossover in the overall spectrum that occurs upon changing the ratio of conductances of the inner and outer point contacts . at big values of the ratio ( closed limit ) , </S>",
    "<S> the levels exhibit a generic behavior expected for the spectrum of a disordered system manifesting level repulsion and brownian `` motion '' upon changing the phases . at small values of the ratio ( open limit ) , </S>",
    "<S> the levels are squeezed into narrow bunches separated by wide smile gaps . </S>",
    "<S> each bunch consists of almost degenerate abs formed by andreev reflection between two adjacent terminals .    </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the properties of the spectrum in the limit of a small ratio , paying special attention to the crossings of bunches . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish two types of crossings : i. with a regular phase dependence of the levels and ii . </S>",
    "<S> crossings where the brownian motion of the levels leads to an apparently irregular phase - dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we work out a perturbation theory that explains the observations both at a detailed level of random scattering in the device and at a phenomenological level of positively defined random matrices .    </S>",
    "<S> the unusual properties of the spectrum originate from rather unobvious topological effects . </S>",
    "<S> topology of the first kind is restricted to the semiclassical limit and related to the winding of the semiclassical green s function . </S>",
    "<S> it is responsible for the closing of the proximity gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> topology of the second kind comes about the discreteness of the number of modes in the point contacts and is responsible for the smile gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the third kind leads to the emergence of weyl points in the spectrum and is not discussed in the context of this article . </S>"
