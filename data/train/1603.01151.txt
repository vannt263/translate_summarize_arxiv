    "the field of fast radio transient detection as a means of discovering new radio sources first came to the forefront when @xcite found 11 such transients in archival parkes multibeam survey data .",
    "they were called rotating radio transients ( rrats ) as the differences between pulse arrival times for each object were found to be multiples of one interval , the rotation period .",
    "rrat rotation periods are on the order of a few hundreds to a few thousands of milliseconds , consistent with rotating neutron stars .",
    "the average rrat rotation period is larger than the average normal pulsar rotation period .",
    "however , for some rrats detected in only one or two observations the published period may be multiples of the actual period because of the small number of pulses detected .",
    "furthermore , there are observational selection effects which result in pulsars with longer periods being detected with higher signal - to - noise in single - pulse searches @xcite .    unlike normal pulsars",
    ", rrats appear to not be emitting a pulse on every rotation , as evidenced by the fact that these objects were missed by fast fourier transform - based periodicity searches .",
    "as more rrats were discovered ( see the rratalog ) and more follow - up observations accumulated , the diversity in emission patterns has made it increasingly likely that different processes are responsible for the intermittency of what initially appeared as one new class of radio sources .",
    "some objects discovered by single - pulse searches are slow pulsars selected against in surveys with short integration times where there are not enough pulses for a detection to be made via periodicity search .",
    "some rrats discovered e.g. at 1.4  ghz appear as normal pulsars when observed at a lower frequency @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the explanation of @xcite that in such cases the intermittency is due to a pulse intensity distribution with a long high - flux tail , such that as the pulsar flux density drops off at higher frequencies , only the brightest pulses remain detectable .",
    "rrats emitting short sequences of pulses on consecutive rotations may be extreme nullers and/or old pulsars close to the death line , where the radio emission mechanism gradually begins to turn off ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in other cases , a single pulse or a single short sequence of pulses",
    "is detected and the rrat is never seen again despite many follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "these detections are consistent with cataclysmic events or a mechanism which generates rare conditions in an otherwise quiescent neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite argue that this emission pattern can be explained by sporadic accretion of debris from a circumpulsar asteroid belt .",
    "all rrats known to date have dispersion measures ( dms , the integrated column density of ionized gas along the line of sight ) consistent with a galactic origin .",
    "@xcite reported a 1.4  ghz parkes detection of a fast radio transient outside of the galactic plane with a dm significantly exceeding the estimated contribution of galactic ionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "more parkes detections of transients with similar properties were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the latter from a targeted observation of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "@xcite detected a transient with similar properties using arecibo , also at 1.4  ghz .",
    "apart from their high dms , most of these fast radio bursts ( frbs ) differ from rrats in that they are only detected with one pulse in their discovery observations . despite many follow - up observations ,",
    "so far repeat pulses have been definitively detected only from the arecibo frb @xcite .",
    "the combination of seemingly extragalactic origin and , until recently , the lack of repeat bursts has suggested cataclysmic events producing a single coherent radio pulse detectable to gpc distances , such as coalescing neutron stars @xcite , evaporating black holes @xcite , or collapsing supramassive neutron stars @xcite .",
    "dissenting views have attributed frbs to galactic flaring stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) and atmospheric phenomena @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of fast radio transients is important in figuring out how their progenitors fit into the evolution of our galaxy and galaxies in general .",
    "they may even provide an independent test of various evolutionary scenarios .",
    "for example , if rrats are assumed to be intermittent since formation and comprise a neutron star population separate from normal pulsars , the galactic core - collapse supernova rate is too low to account for both populations @xcite .",
    "this is not the case if rrats represent a stage in the evolution of pulsars , even though they may outnumber other pulsar types since their sporadic pulses make them less likely to be discovered by pulsar surveys .",
    "all frbs known to date have been found at 1.4  ghz even though surveys conducted at 350 mhz with the green bank telescope search dms up to 1000  pc  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is still unknown whether that is due only to selection effects or has intrinsic causes as well .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of running clusterrank , a new algorithm for identifying astrophysical radio transients , on data collected by the arecibo 327  mhz drift pulsar survey ( ao327 ) .",
    "section  [ sec_obs ] describes the ao327 survey setup and observations , section  [ sec_sp ] gives details on the single - pulse search code whose output clusterrank operates on , and section  [ sec_clusterrank ] focuses on clusterrank implementation and performance . sections  [ sec_psrs ] and [ sec_rrats ] present new pulsars and rrats , respectively , and section  [ sec_stats ] analyzes the statistics of both types of discoveries .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_frblimits ] places limits on the frb population .",
    "the ao327 drift survey is running since 2010 during arecibo telescope downtime or unassigned time .",
    "it aims to search the entire arecibo sky ( declinations from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) for pulsars and transients at 327  mhz .",
    "phase i of the survey covers declinations from @xmath8 to @xmath10 , and phase ii will cover the remainder of the sky accessible to arecibo . under normal operating conditions , ao327 does not get observing time within @xmath11 from the galactic plane . frequencies higher than 327  mhz are more suitable for pulsar and transient searches within the galactic plane because of significant dispersion and scattering due to galactic ionized gas .",
    "however , telescope time occasionally becomes available on short notice due to technical problems that render regularly scheduled projects unable to observe .",
    "ao327 is a filler project in such cases , and some of its discoveries were made during unscheduled encroachments on the galactic plane .    in this paper",
    "we present single - pulse search results from analyzing 882  h of data taken with the arecibo 327  mhz receiver and the mock spectrometer backend , up until march 2014 , when ao327 began using the newer puppi backend .",
    "an analysis of puppi data will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the effective integration time is @xmath12  s for ao327 observations , corresponding to the drift time through the beam at 327  mhz . for mock observations , the number of channels is @xmath13 , the bandwidth is @xmath14  mhz , the sampling time is @xmath15s , the receiver temperature is @xmath16  k , and the gain is @xmath17  k / jy",
    ".    figure  [ fig_smin ] shows the intrinsic minimum detectable flux density @xmath18 vs. dm for ao327 using the mock spectrometer , for the green bank north celestial cap survey ( gbncc , @xcite ) , and for the gbt350 drift survey @xcite .",
    "according to the radiometer equation applied to single pulse detection @xcite s_int , min = ( )  , [ eqn_smin ] where @xmath19 is the detection threshold , the sky temperature @xmath20  k @xcite ( appropriate for a source out of the galactic plane ) , @xmath21 is the intrinsic pulse width , and @xmath22 is the observed broadened pulse width .",
    "the two pulse width quantities are related by w_obs = ( w_int^2 + dt^2 + _ s^2 + t_dm,1ch^2)^1/2 , where @xmath23 is the scattering broadening estimated from eqn .  7 in @xcite , and @xmath24 is the dispersion delay across a channel width .",

    "the spacing between successive trial dms increases from 0.02 to 1.0  pc  @xmath1 such that at high dms the smearing due to a pulsar s actual dm being halfway between two trial dms is much smaller than the scattering broadening estimated from the empirical fit of @xcite . because scattering broadening dwarfs the sampling time even at moderate dms , during dedispersion data are downsampled by a factor that increases as the trial dm increases ( table  [ tab_dedisp ] ) .",
    ".the step between successive trial dms and the downsampling factors used for different dm ranges in processing ao327 mock data . as the trial dm increases , uncorrectable scattering broadening begins to dominate sensitivity .",

    "two bright signals assigned high scores by clusterrank were also not detected in follow - up observations .",
    "further inspection revealed that their sweep in time - frequency space does not completely conform to the cold - plasma dispersion relation .",
    "we classify them as perytons , terrestrial rfi mimicking a dispersed signal @xcite .",
    "the total follow - up observation time is one hour for peryton p1907 + 06 , and 1.6  h for peryton p1017 + 02 .",

    "they are readily recognized visually since the corresponding clusters of events have a limited extent in dm and a definite peak in @xmath28 vs. dm that is consistent between pulses from the same source .",
    "however , they exhibit complex substructure and secondary peaks in @xmath28 vs. dm space",
    ". this corresponds to a similarly complex resolved substructure in each pulse , such that different components are aligned and summed at different trial dms .",
    "p1017 + 02 and p1907 + 06 also differ from the rrats in table  [ tab_rrats ] in that they are brighter by an order of magnitude .",

    "all pulses from p1017 + 02 and p1907 + 06 exhibit the same tickmark - like signature , indicating a chirped signal with an abrupt sign reversal of the chirp rate .",
    "such signals have also been detected by the gbt350 survey ( c.  karako - argaman , private communication ) and anecdotal accounts suggest that they may be generated in the process of shutting down the transmitters of some aircraft .",

    "following the analysis presented by @xcite , we compare the properties of clusterrank discoveries with those of known pulsars and rrats .",
    "the average period for pulsars found by clusterrank is 2.2  s. this is larger than the 0.9  s average period for non - msp ( @xmath36  s ) pulsars from the atnf catalog , but similar to the 2.3  s average period of rrats with measured periods in the rratalog .",
    "however , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) two - sample test between clusterrank pulsar discoveries and rratalog objects yields a p - value of 0.017 , suggesting that the two sets are not drawn from the same period distribution .",
    "in contrast , the same type of test between clusterrank rrat discoveries with period estimates and rratalog objects yields a p - value of 0.93 , indicating consistency with the null hypothesis of the same underlying period distribution for both sets .",
    "of the 115 objects currently in the rratalog , 85 were discovered by surveys operating at 1400  mhz and using significantly longer integration times than ao327 .",
    "this suggests that neither the observing frequency nor the number of rotations within a standard survey observation result in strong selection effects when we consider the period distribution of rrat discoveries . the latter may be explained by the fact that follow - up observations of newly discovered rrats are typically longer than the discovery observation and thus slow pulsars discovered by single - pulse search are likely to be identified as periodic emitters when reobserved .",
    "the weak dependence on observing frequency is due to the fact that dispersion ( @xmath37 ) and scattering broadening ( @xmath38 ) do not significantly select against detecting rrats at 327 vs. 1400  mhz due to their long periods .",
    "since the dm and spatial distribution of a set of pulsar discoveries depends on what region of the sky survey observations are targeting , we can meaningfully compare clusterrank discoveries only with ao327 periodicity search discoveries . performing two - sample k - s tests between these two sets",
    "we obtain a p - value of 0.60 for their dm distributions , and p - values of 0.87 and 0.98 for the galactic latitude and longitude , respectively .",
    "therefore we can conclude that clusterrank discoveries are drawn from the same spatial and dm distribution as ao327 periodicity search discoveries .",
    "we did not find any frbs in the ao327-mock data set presented in this paper .",
    "however , as we outline in section  [ sec_frbcons ] , the methods usually employed for calculating the optimal trial dm list for a pulsar search assume a relationship between dispersion and scattering typical of galactic sources that does not hold for known frbs .",
    "we plan to reprocess all ao327 survey data with a trial dm list optimized for detecting highly dispersed but not significantly scattered frb pulses .",
    "the first upper limits on the all - sky frb rate are from parkes pulsar surveys and their frb detections .",
    "for frbs with a flux density @xmath39  jy at 1.4  ghz , @xcite estimate a rate of @xmath40  sky@xmath6  day@xmath6 from high - latitude data , and @xcite estimate a rate of @xmath41  sky@xmath6  day@xmath6 from intermediate- and low - latitude data .",
    "@xcite argue that the difference is statistically significant but acknowledge that the estimates use assumptions whose validity about frbs is unknown . @xcite",
    "derive a limit of @xmath42  day@xmath6 sky@xmath6 for bursts with a flux density @xmath43  jy at latitudes @xmath44 and argue that this is consistent with rates from other parkes surveys .",
    "@xcite , who did not find any frbs in gbt350 drift data , derive a limit on the rate of bursts with @xmath45  mjy and widths @xmath46  ms at 350  mhz and obtain @xmath47  sky@xmath6  day@xmath6 .",
    "we assume that frbs follow poisson statistics in order to calculate a similar rate limit from ao327-mock sky coverage .",
    "the poisson probability of detecting exactly @xmath48 frbs in a survey of total duration @xmath49 is p(x = k ) = , where @xmath50 is the beam area and @xmath51 is the burst rate .",
    "the probability of detecting at least one frb is @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate that for a 99% chance of detecting at least one frb in the 882  h of ao327-mock data , the rate is @xmath53  sky@xmath6  day@xmath6 for 10  ms bursts with @xmath54  mjy .",
    "the limit derived from ao327-mock is less stringent than the limits from gbt350 or the parkes surveys , because ao327-mock has significantly less total on - sky time and smaller beam size .",
    "since the spectral indices of frbs are on the whole unknown , we can meaningfully compare the ao327-mock limit only with the gbt350 limit .",
    "ao327-mock searches 5 times more volume per unit time than gbt350 ( @xcite , figure  4 )",
    ". therefore , the ao327-mock frb rate limit normalized to the gtb350 search volume is @xmath55  sky@xmath6  day@xmath6 .",
    "this estimate will improve when results from ao327-puppi are included , in addition to results from reprocessing ao327-mock data with a dm list tailored for frb detection .",
    "we have developed clusterrank , a new algorithm to automatically rank clusters of events recorded by single - pulse searches based on each cluster s likelihood of being generated by a dispersed astrophysical pulse .",
    "clusterrank enabled us to quickly identify 8 rrats and 14 slow pulsars missed by an fft - based periodicity search in ao327 drift survey data .",
    "the new rrats have dms in the range @xmath56  pc  @xmath1 .",
    "five of these sources have period estimates from pulse arrival times ; their periods are in the range @xmath2  s. the new pulsars have dms in the range @xmath3  pc  @xmath1 and periods in the range @xmath4  s.    we find that the periods of rrats found by clusterrank are drawn from the same distribution as the periods of sources in the rratalog , and that the periods of pulsars and rrats discovered by clusterrank are consistent with having the same underlying distribution .",
    "we also find that there is no significant difference between the underlying dm or spatial distributions of new sources found by ao327 via periodicity search vs. new sources found via using clusterrank on presto single - pulse search output .",
    "although we search ao327 data with dms up to 1000  pc  @xmath1 , we have not yet found any highly dispersed pulses indicative of frbs .",
    "we identify a common optimization in constructing trial dms lists for pulsar surveys that likely hinders the identification of such pulses either visually or algorithmically and recommend that the dm search space be deliberately oversampled for dm  @xmath57  pc  @xmath1 compared to what is optimal for galactic sources .",
