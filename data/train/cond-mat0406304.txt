    "since the earliest arpes studies of optimally doped bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( bscco ) , spectral features near the fermi level have been reported whose width suggested the existence of a significant elastic scattering contribution which varied along the fermi surface , taking its smallest value along the @xmath6 diagonal and largest near the @xmath7 region@xcite .",
    "the shapes of the measured energy dispersion curves ( edcs ) are quite unusual , suggesting that the 1-electron self energy is also strongly energy dependent .",
    "abrahams and varma@xcite attempted to account for both features by assuming that the self energy was a sum of an energy - independent part arising from small - angle ( forward ) scattering , and a second , momentum independent term modelled with marginal fermi liquid theory .",
    "they noted that the elastic forward scattering was most probably associated with impurities which were located away from the cuo@xmath4 planes and reflected the @xmath8 variation of the momentum - resolved density of states as @xmath9 moved around the fermi surface .",
    "they further remarked that , despite the large scattering rates of order 100mev deduced from fits to arpes spectra , the forward scattering nature of the disorder would be consistent with such scattering having a negligible effect on the resistivity of the optimally doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that this type of disorder would have a small effect on @xmath0@xcite .",
    "there are two obvious difficulties with this scenario .",
    "the first is that the spectral peak measured by arpes near the @xmath10 point is known to sharpen dramatically when one goes below @xmath0 , a phenomenon interpreted as the formation of a coherent quasiparticle in the superconducting state .",
    "this sharpening has normally been attributed to the well - known collapse of the inelastic scattering rate below @xmath0 due to the opening of the superconducting gap , but it is hard _ a priori _ to guess why something similar should happen in the presence of an elastic scattering rate of order 100mev .",
    "the second problem is that recently increased momentum resolution@xcite and the use of different photon energies@xcite has resolved a bilayer splitting which has its maximum effect near the @xmath10 point .",
    "some of the previously observed  elastic broadening \" is therefore certainly due to this as well as to pseudogap effects@xcite , but exactly how much is not clear .    on the other hand , one can not ignore the out - of - plane disorder .",
    "the bscco material is thought to be doped by excess oxygen in the sro and bio planes , and even the best single crystals are believed to contain significant amounts of cation switching and other out - of - plane defects@xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that quasiparticles moving in the cuo@xmath4 planes of this material must experience a smooth potential landscape due to these defects , and useful to pursue the question of the effect of this type of scattering in the superconducting state .",
    "in fact , fits@xcite to fourier transformed - scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements@xcite on similar samples to those used in the arpes studies have recently been shown to require both a strong ( near - unitary limit ) scattering component , attributed to native defects in the cu0@xmath4 planes , as well as a weaker , smooth scattering potential component attributed to defects away from the plane .",
    "recently , markiewicz has also attempted to relate stm and arpes data in the superconducting state assuming a smooth potential.@xcite    in this work we model the complex collection of out - of - plane defects with a simple set of impurity potentials with finite range , and find a number of surprising results .",
    "the first is that the elastic scattering rate indeed  collapses \" in the superconducting state in the strong forward scattering limit , leading to a sharp spectral feature everywhere on the fermi surface except at the nodal point itself .",
    "the second is that as one goes away from the fermi surface , this feature disperses away as expected for a quasiparticle peak _ only _ if the system is sufficiently clean ; otherwise it remains pinned to the gap edge .",
    "this would appear to explain the apparent lack of quasiparticle dispersion in older samples . in some situations",
    "both a nondispersive gap edge peak and a dispersing quasiparticle feature can be simultaneously observed . while we do not attempt a direct fit to experiment , we show that assuming a rather simple and physically motivated model for the one electron self - energy , which combines the above description of forward elastic scattering with strong pointlike elastic scattering and spin fluctuation inelastic scattering , allows us to calculate a spectral function which appears to reproduce many of the qualitative features of current arpes data on optimally to overdoped cuprates .",
    "it is our hope that the ideas presented here can help unravel some of the mysteries surrounding the behavior of what is generally called the superconducting ",
    "quasiparticle peak \" , and allow a more accurate description of the actual propagating excitation .",
    "they will also have important immediate implications for other bulk properties of the superconducting state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses general effects of extended impurities scattering on the arpes spectrum in both the normal and superconducting states . in section iii",
    ", we examine the effect of adding an isotropic elastic scattering due to unitary scatterers as well as the inelastic scattering due to spin fluctuations .",
    "finally , section iv contains our comparison with existing data , conclusions and plans for future work .",
    "we first consider a model system where scattering occurs only because of disorder .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume that the most important feature of the potential due to out - of - plane impurities experienced by electrons moving in the cuo@xmath4 planes is its finite range @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore model a single impurity simply as a term @xmath12 , or @xmath13 where @xmath14 sets the strength of the potential and @xmath11 is its range .",
    "note that @xmath9 and @xmath15 are only defined up to a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the self - energy due to many such impurities gives rise to an elastic broadening of quasiparticle states which depends upon the position of @xmath16 in the brillouin zone .",
    "for weak scattering , the born approximation for the retarded self - energy associated with a random distribution of @xmath17 impurities per unit area has the usual form in the normal state @xmath18 where @xmath2 is understood to include an infinitesimal positive imaginary part , and the superscript on the single - particle green s function @xmath19 indicates that at first we ignore self - consistency , i.e. @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath21 .    to model the electronic structure we take a simple near - neighbor hopping @xmath22 and next - near - neighbor hopping @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 and set @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that with this choice of parameters there is a van hove singularity with a peak in the total density of states at @xmath27 .",
    "the fermi surface for these parameters is shown in fig .",

    "the energy distribution curves of @xmath29 will be discussed for @xmath30 ( nodal ) , @xmath31 ( antinodal ) , and various @xmath32 values along the @xmath33 to @xmath34 cut shown by the solid points . ]    as the range of the potential @xmath11 increases , the scattering of a quasiparticle from @xmath9 to @xmath15 becomes peaked in the forward direction .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : scattrange ] , when @xmath9 is close to @xmath15 and both are not too far from the fermi surface , we may parameterize them as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the momentum transfer and @xmath37 its component parallel to the fermi surface .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the projections of @xmath9 and @xmath15 onto the fermi surface , respectively , such that , e.g. , @xmath40 . the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy ( [ bornsigma ] ) becomes      . ]",
    "( [ sigapprox1 ] ) shows explicitly that in the limit of small @xmath42 , the self - energy becomes more and more sharply peaked  on the mass shell \" @xmath43 .",
    "this is a generic feature of long - range potentials .",
    "for example , on the fermi surface @xmath44 at @xmath45 , @xmath46 is approached by the exact result ( [ bornsigma ] ) as @xmath42 decreases and the range of the scattering is increased . in the figure and in what follows in this section , we will use the result ( [ gamma0def ] ) with @xmath47 chosen such that @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 mev for @xmath50 ev . from fig .",
    "3 we see that in the forward scattering limit , @xmath51 .",
    "we stress that the precise dependence of the forward elastic part of the self - energy ( [ gamma0def ] ) on @xmath42 and on momentum depend on the details of the fermi surface shape and impurity scattering potential .",
    "however , we do not expect qualitative features of the resulting spectra to be affected .",
    "we note further that the absolute magnitudes of the parameters chosen are roughly consistent with the @xmath52(10% ) weak scatterers of strength @xmath14 of @xmath53 and range of @xmath52 ( 1 - 2@xmath54 ) extracted from ft - sts data in ref .  @xcite . in section iii , we will show results for various values of @xmath55 and @xmath42 .     in units of @xmath22 plotted around the fermi surface with @xmath56 .",

    "the dashed curve is proportional to @xmath60 and one sees that as @xmath42 decreases and the scattering peaks in the forward direction , @xmath61 varies as @xmath60 . ]",
    "thus far we have not considered the effect of self - consistency , i.e. replacing @xmath20 in eq .",

    "is used to ignoring this distinction , as the self - consistent solution for pointlike scatterers can be shown to be identical to the non - self - consistent one up to corrections of order @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the fermi energy .",
    "if the scatterers have a finite range , however , this argument breaks down and self - consistency becomes important . as seen in figure [ fig : scattrate ] , the effect of self - consistency is to reduce the frequency dependence of @xmath65 induced by electronic structure ; in particular , the van hove singularity at @xmath66 is eliminated .",
    "this may account for the complete absence of van hove spectral features in stm and other tunnelling experiments on bscco .",
    "we note further that the scattering rate is cut off in the forward scattering case @xmath67 when @xmath68 , reflecting the fact that if the electron s momentum can only be shifted by a small amount @xmath69 , the allowed energy transfer is also restricted .     for @xmath9 on the fermi surface at points a ( left ) and n ( right ) , for two different values of forward scattering parameter @xmath70 5 ( top ) and 0.5 ( bottom ) .",

    "if one goes a short angular distance away from the node along the fermi surface , one finds at low @xmath155 not a smooth lorentzian for @xmath186 , but rather a square root singularity with a small local gap @xmath116 . averaging over a small @xmath32 region will therefore make the  leading edge \" of this spectrum appear much sharper .     vs. @xmath9 , including full model self - energy with @xmath67 and @xmath187 .",
    "b ) the half - width of @xmath188 at half - maximum , @xmath189 , plotted vs.  @xmath190 . ]",
    "the intrinsic @xmath155-dependent broadening is therefore most clearly seen in the momentum distribution curves ( mdc s ) , which in this work ( see eq .  ) are simply lorentzians centered at the fermi surface . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdc_c ] , we show that , within this model , the rate of sharpening of the nodal mdc s indeed increases somewhat in the superconducting state as the temperature is lowered , but that the widths saturate at a value determined by the elastic scattering . the temperature dependence of @xmath189 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdc_c ] is in disagreement with the results of valla et al.@xcite , who reported a linear mdc width dependence on temperature even in the superconducting state .",
    "however , the type of @xmath2 and @xmath155 dependence we find would appear to be consistent with nodal edc linewidth measurements of kaminski et al @xcite .",
    "the main point of this work is to raise the possibility that some of the arpes observations on optimally or overdoped samples which appeared to be in conflict with the bcs results may in fact fit within the bcs framework when the effects of forward elastic scattering are taken into account .",
    "thus , while forward elastic scattering can be responsible for some of the anomalous width of the spectral function measured above @xmath0 , this need not be in conflict with the observation of a sharp spectral feature in the antinodal region below @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath55 is larger than @xmath191 , the intensity associated with the area under this feature varies as @xmath192 , which depends upon the doping and temperature . at the same time , the spectrum at the nodal point can exhibit a lorentzian behavior with a width that evolves smoothly through @xmath0 and then partially narrows as the inelastic scattering is suppressed by the opening of the gap .",
    "we have seen that these effects occur because of a phenomenon similar to anderson s theorem which applies for much of the fermi surface of a @xmath1-wave superconductor in the forward scattering limit : if scattering is sufficiently peaked in the forward direction , the scattering process does not mix states with different signs of the order parameter , and no pairbreaking occurs . sufficiently near the nodal point",
    ", however , the sign change always takes place , implying that the full width of the quasiparticle due to elastic scattering is recovered at the nodal @xmath89 .",
    "we have discussed simple approximate forms as well as fully self - consistent numerical calculations for the elastic self - energies . in the overall model for the self - energy ,",
    "we also included an approximate treatment of electron - electron collisions , as well as unitary  native defect \" scatterers observed to be present in the bscco-2212 material in stm experiments .",
    "the energy distribution curves found in the self - consistent calculations using this model show no influence of the van hove singularity , and display an asymmetric shape with a rounded square root peak near the local gap edge .",
    "widths and temperature dependences can be obtained which appear comparable to experiment , but it is difficult to compare directly because of the unknown arpes background signal and bilayer splitting , which was not included here .",
    "we also discussed the temperature dependence of the momentum distribution curves in the superconducting state at the nodal point .",
    "it was found to have a lorentzian shape which narrows with decreasing temperature in the superconducting state , due to the suppression of inelastic scattering , saturating at a value determined by the elastic scattering .",
    "along the momentum cut @xmath175 to @xmath176 , if @xmath55 is small compared to @xmath116 , we find a dispersing quasiparticle peak at @xmath193 . however , when @xmath55 is comparable with @xmath116 , the maximum response occurs for @xmath194 , does not disperse as @xmath9 moves away from the fermi level , and can still represent a sharp spectral feature .",
    "this is similar to some of the older data on the bscco-2212 system , which has not been explained at this writing and might have been taken for some new type of dispersionless excitation in the superconducting state .",
    "however , as we have shown , it is simply the consequence of forward elastic scattering which is suppressed at the gap edge in the superconducting state .",
    "here we have focussed primarily on the effects of forward elastic scattering on the bscco-2212 arpes spectrum , and found that a model of several per cent weak out - of - plane scatterers with a range of order one lattice spacing , similar to current models of fourier transform stm measurements , can explain many qualitative features of the arpes data .",
    "we believe that the unique way in which this material is doped and disordered using current crystal growth techniques endows it with an effective disorder potential which strongly influences the low - energy quasiparticle properties in a way which is characteristically different from the much cleaner ybco system , for example .",
    "this picture should have important and calculable consequences for other superconducting properties , such as microwave conductivity , which we explore elsewhere .",
