    "low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto the central supermassive black hole , similarly to powerful active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the intrinsic faintness , i.e. @xmath2 , and the low level of activity are the distinctive characteristics of llagns , which mainly consists of local seyfert galaxies and low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) . in terms of eddington luminosity ,",
    "most of llagns have @xmath3 , compared to @xmath4 of luminous agns @xcite .",
    "it still remains unclear whether llagns are a scaled - down luminosity version of classical agns or objects powered by different physical mechanisms .",
    "alternatively , llagns could represent a scaled up version of black hole binaries in the steady - jet , hard x - ray state , as pointed out by the scaling relations reported in @xcite .",
    "the accretion processes of llagns are still not well understood . for a sample of 47 local seyfert galaixes selected from the palomar optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies",
    "@xcite , @xcite found a strong linear correlations between the nuclear 2 - 10 kev , [ oiii]@xmath5 , @xmath6 luminosities with the same slope as quasars and luminous seyfert galaxies , independent of the level of nuclear activity displayed .",
    "the authors thus argued that the local seyfert galaxies are consistent with being a scaled - down version of more luminous agns .",
    "most recently , through revisiting the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of 13 nearby liners using recently published , high - angular - resolution data at radio , ultraviolet ( uv ) , and x - ray wavelengths , @xcite found that the seds of liners are quite similar to those of seyferts up to luminosities of @xmath7 , and there is no evidence for a sharp change in the sed of agns at the lowest luminosities .",
    "this result indicates that the thin agn accretion disks may persist at low accretion rates , which is also recently claimed by @xcite from the fact that the near - ir to x - ray spectrum of four low - luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies has the same shape as that of luminous quasars .",
    "however , the radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs : an updated version of adaf ; see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) have been invoked to explain some of the spectral properties observed in many llagns , such as the lack of the  big blue bump \" @xcite , and can be used to explain the sed of several llagns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "x - rays are one of the most direct evidence of nuclear activity and are , therefore , fundamental to study the accretion processes .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emission has been recently explored for the samples of liner galaxies and local seyfert galaxies from the observations with chandra and xmm - newton telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high spatial resolution of chandra telescope allows the detection of the emission from the genuine active nuclei , not contaminated by off - nuclear sources and/or diffuse emisison .",
    "usually , the agn nature can be defined as the appearance of nuclei emission in hard x - ray bands .",
    "although the lack of this feature may likely imply non - agn contribution , such as the emission from the diffuse hot gas and/or the starbursts , it does not necessarily rule out the agn source nature , since the non - detection can be due to the heavy absorption .",
    "it has been pointed out that the lack of uv bump in the liner sed may not be intrinsic , but simply the effect of obscuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the spatial resolution of xmm - newton telescope is not enough to separate the off - nuclear sources and/or diffuse emission , its superior sensitivity and high throughput provide higher signal - to - noise spectra and the presence of diffuse thermal emission can be indirectly inferred from the spectral analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the chandra and xmm - newtwon images and spectra of the local seyfert galaxies produced in the 0.3 - 10 kev band have showed a high detection rate ( @xmath8% ) of active nuclei , charcterized , in @xmath9% of the objects , also by the presence of nearby off - nuclear sources and/or , in @xmath10% of the objects , diffuse emission @xcite . from an homogeneous analysis of the chandra x - ray data available for a sample of 51 liner galaxies ,",
    "@xcite claimed that a high percentage of liner galaxies , at least @xmath11 , could host agn nuclei , and @xmath12 sources lacking a hard nuclear source were regarded as starburst candidates , because they either lack an energetically significant agn or contain highly obscured agn .",
    "consistently , both from the chandra observations , @xcite concluded that in about 60% of 19 liner sources in their sample an agn is present , and @xcite found that at least 50% of 82 liners harbor a central hard x - ray source consistent with an agn .    the hard x - ray nuclei emission can well trace the agn nature in llagns , however , the origin of the x - ray emission of llagns is still largely debated .",
    "the x - ray emission can be either from the jet @xcite or from the riaf @xcite .",
    "it could even be from the accretion - flow / hot - corona system of radiative efficient accretion , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite that the thin agn accretion disks may still persist at low accretion rates . from an experimental investigation on the correlation between the hard x - ray photon index @xmath0 with the eddington ratio @xmath13 for a sample of luminous agns",
    ", @xcite suggested that the hard x - ray photon index can be a good indicator of accretion rate .",
    "in fact , this relation has been explored in various works , mostly for luminous agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and occasionally for x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) @xcite , through which the x - ray origin and accretion processes were investigated",
    ". however , this has never been explored for llagns . in this paper , we present the relationship between the hard x - ray photon index @xmath0 and the eddington ratio @xmath1 for a sample of llagns , with the aim to constrain the origin of x - ray emission and the accretion processes in these objects . this paper is organized as follows : the sample is described in section 2 , the results are given in section 3 and section 4 presents discussions .",
    "we started from the samples of liners and local seyfert galaxies of the palomar sample @xcite and the multiwavelength catalogue of liners ( mcl ) complied by @xcite . from the palomar optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite , high - quality spectra of 486 bright ( @xmath14 mag ) , northern ( @xmath15 ) galaxies",
    "have been taken and a comprehensive , homogeneous catalog of spectral classifications of all galaxies have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the palomar survey is complete to @xmath16 mag and @xmath17 complete to @xmath18 mag .",
    "based on the relative strength of the optical forbidden lines ( [ o iii ] @xmath5 , [ o i ] @xmath19 , [ n ii ] @xmath20 and [ s ii ] @xmath21 ) compared to the hydrogen balmer lines , h ii nuclei and agns were distinguished .",
    "moreover , the ratio [ o iii ] @xmath22 was used to distinguish liners ( @xmath23/h\\beta<3 $ ] ) from seyferts ( @xmath24/h\\beta\\geq3 $ ] ) . from this survey",
    "it has been shown that agns are very common ( @xmath12 ) in nearby galaxies with seyfert galaxies being @xmath25 , pure liners @xmath26 and transition objects ( with [ o i ] strengths intermediate between those of h ii nuclei and liners ; composite systems having both an hii region and a liner component @xcite ) @xmath27 of all galaxies , respectively .",
    "the mcl includes most of the liners know until 1999 , providing information on broad band and monochromatic emission from radio frequencies to x - rays for 476 objects classified as liners .",
    "the optical classification was reanalyzed by using the line - ratio diagrams by @xcite , and most of the galaxies can be considered as ` pure ' liners .",
    "we searched the literatures for all the available observations with chandra or xmm - newton telescopes . due to the fact that the x - ray emission are complex in these objects , and to ensure that we are exploring the properties of genuine emission from nuclei agns ,",
    "the source selection were carefully performed .",
    "thanks to the high spatial resolution of chandra , the genuine agns are selected from the appearance of the nuclei at hard x - ray band ( @xmath282 kev ) . those sources without the nuclei at hard x - ray band are excluded in this work , though some of them may have central active nuclei , which can be heavily obscured @xcite . to get the hard x - ray photon index @xmath0 , the sufficient count rates to perform the spectral fitting in 2 - 10 kev band are required .",
    "compton - thick sources are identified by @xcite using flux diagnostic diagrams , which are based on measuring the x - ray luminosity against an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic brightness of the source to evaluate the true amount of absorption .",
    "specifically , the flux ratio of x - ray to [ o iii]@xmath29 @xmath30}$ ] and [ o iii]@xmath29 to far - infrared @xmath31}/f_{\\rm ir}$ ] is used to identify the compton thick sources with @xmath32}<1 $ ] , in addition to identify the agn - dominant ( non - starburst ) emission in sources with @xmath31}/f_{\\rm ir}>10^{-4}$ ] @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we exclude the compton - thick sources identified in @xcite , since the compton - thick absorption may cause the flatter x - ray photon index and lower absorption when doing spectral fitting in 2 - 10 kev band , which may not be real .",
    "moreover , the available measurements of black hole mass or stellar velocity dispersion are also required .    finally , we compiled a sample of 55 sources , of which 27 are liners and 28 are local seyfert galaxies .",
    "all the local seyfert galaxies are from @xcite sample , and the liners are from either @xcite sample or mcl . the photon index from the spectral fitting and the resulting luminosity in 2 - 10 kev band of nuclei agns",
    "were collected from literatures , of which xmm - newton data for 20 sources ( all are seyferts ) and chandra data for 33 sources ( 6 seyferts and 27 liners ) .",
    "in addition , the asca data are collected for 2 seyfert galaxies ( ngc 2639 and ngc 2655 ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our sample is listed in table [ tbl-1 ] , in which column ( 1 ) source name , column ( 2 ) redshift , column ( 3 ) x - ray satellite used : `` c''=chandra , `` x''=xmm - newton , `` a''=asca , column ( 4 ) the photon index between 2 and 10 kev , column ( 5 ) the 2 - 10 kev luminosity in units of @xmath33 , column ( 6 ) the references of x - ray data , column ( 7 ) the mass of central black hole in the units of solar mass , and column ( 8) is the references of black hole masses .",
    "we collected the black hole masses @xmath34 available from literatures , which were estimated in different ways from gas , stellar and maser kinematics to reverberation mapping or inferred from the mass - velocity dispersion correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those @xmath34 estimated with the mass - velocity dispersion relation different from the @xcite relation , we re - calculated @xmath34 with the @xcite relation . for those sources without measured @xmath35 from literatures , we estimate @xmath34 from the stellar velocity dispersion provided by the hypercat database using the @xcite relation . in table",
    "[ tbl-1 ] , we report all these @xmath34 estimates , the method used to calculate them and the corresponding references . to calculate the bolometric luminosity , we have assumed that @xmath36 , which is typical of luminous agn , being normally in the range of 25 - 30 @xcite . it can be seen from table [ tbl-1 ] that the x - ray luminosity @xmath37 of our sample ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . correspondingly , the bolometric luminosity @xmath40 varies from @xmath41 to @xmath42 with most sources ( 53 of 55 sources ) lower than @xmath43 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the relationship between the photon index @xmath0 at 2 - 10 kev band and the eddington ratio @xmath13 for our sample . to compare with luminous agns ,",
    "we also plot the pg quasars of @xcite . for better comparisons , we calculated @xmath44 also for pg quasars , instead of using optical continuum luminosity in @xcite .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the eddington ratio @xmath45 of our sample covers a wide range from @xmath46 going down to @xmath47 , compared to those of most pg quasars @xmath48 . for most of our sources ,",
    "the hard x - ray photon index @xmath0 lies in the range of 1.0 - 2.0 .",
    "we find a significant anti - correlation between the photon index @xmath0 at 2 - 10 kev band and the eddington ratio @xmath1 with a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath49 at @xmath50 confidence level for all our llagns .",
    "this significant anti - correlation is found to be slightly improved ( @xmath51 at @xmath52 confidence level ) when only local seyfert galaxies are considered .",
    "however , we find no strong correlation ( @xmath53 at @xmath54 confidence level ) if we consider liners only .",
    "this may be caused by the fact that large scatter exist in photon index of liners , especially those with @xmath55 , and liners cover relatively narrower range in @xmath1 than that of local seyfert galaxies , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "the significant anti - correlation we found for our llagns is contrast with the positive correlation for luminous agns as clearly shown by the pg quasars in fig .",
    "however , our result is consistent with that of xrbs at low state @xcite .    for our sample of 55 llagns , a standard @xmath56 minimization method weighted by the errors on @xmath0 yields",
    "the following linear relation : @xmath57 which is shown in fig .",
    "to quantitatively compare with luminous agns , we plot our linear fit to @xcite pg quasars , i.e. @xmath58 . as an updated version of @xcite work , we also plot the recent linear fit @xmath59 presented by @xcite for a sample of 35 moderate- to high - luminosity radio quiet agns .",
    "it should be noted that the @xcite fit is based on @xmath40 derived from optical continuum luminosity for a larger sample .",
    "this may cause the differences in two linear fits of luminous agns , which however is consistent with each other within errors .",
    "in this work , instead of performing a rigorous and homogeneous spectral analysis , we simply collected the hard x - ray photon index from the literatures for our sample sources , especially for liners ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this may potentially affect the conclusions , since different authors may use different models to fit the x - ray spectra ( e.g. absorbed power - law , broken power - law , partially absorbed power - law , power - law plus thermal component , etc . ) . in principle , for consistent reasons , the same baseline model should be used . however , the commonly used method in literatures , e.g. , as shown in @xcite and @xcite , is that the different models are tried to fit the x - ray spectra , and the best fit is usually obtained with the acceptable @xmath56 minimization . for a sample of 51 liners in @xcite ,",
    "two models were used to fit chandra data , i.e. a single power - law and a single - temperature optically - thin plasma emission ( mekal or raymond smith ( raymond & smith 1977 ) model ) . for each object ,",
    "five models were attempted : power - law ( pl ) , raymond - smith ( rs ) , mekal ( me ) , pl+rs , and pl+me .",
    "the best model was chosen as that with the best @xmath56-reduced statistic ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . as a result",
    ", the best fit can be pl for some sources ( e.g. ngc 4374 ) , however it can be pl+me for other sources ( e.g. ngc 2681 ) .",
    "in contrast , six models ( blackbody , comptonized blackbody , accretion disk , hot diffuse gas , power - law and xrb comptonization ) and their linear combinations were tested in @xcite in order to find the most appropriate model for the x - ray spectra of liners .",
    "their spectral fits show that a same model is difficult to well fit all the liners x - ray spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "the different spectral fits can be obtained in different works for same chandra data in same source .",
    "indeed , seven liners in our sample ( i.e. ngc 315 , ngc 2681 , ngc 4374 , ngc 4410a , ngc 4457 , ngc 4494 and ngc 4552 ) , can be found with same chandra data reduced in @xcite and/or @xcite , @xcite . in these sources ,",
    "the x - ray spectra can be well fitted by either single power - law or power - law plus thermal component , however , the photon index from different works are consistent with each other within the errors . as a good example , for ngc 4374 , the best fit of @xcite is power - law model with @xmath60 , while @xcite shows a best fit of power - law plus mekal model with @xmath61 .",
    "for these seven liners , we choose the results with the smallest error in @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that the x - ray data of seyfert galaxies are all from @xcite and @xcite , in which the homogeneous analysis was committed . in contrast , liners are from various works .",
    "compared to a significant anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath62 in seyferts , no correlation is found in liners .",
    "it is not clear whether the inhomogeneous spectral analysis smear the correlation in liners .",
    "nevertheless , it would be important to revisit our results through a rigorous and homogeneous spectral analysis . since our sample data were collected from chandra and xmm - newton telescopes , it is thus interesting to see whether the anti - correlation still holds using chandra and xmm - newton data separately .",
    "we found a significant anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 at @xmath64% confidence level for 20 xmm - newton sources .",
    "however , no strong correlation is found for 33 chandra sources ( @xmath65 at @xmath66% confidence level ) . clearly , this result is mainly due to the fact that 20 xmm - newton sources are all seyferts , and 33 chandra sources are dominated by liners ( 27 of 33 ) .",
    "the classification of seyfert / liner was investigated in many occasions based on four optical line ratios @xmath24/h\\beta$ ] , @xmath67/h\\alpha$ ] , @xmath68/h\\alpha$ ] , and @xmath69/h\\alpha$ ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the comparisons between the various classification schemes have also been made , which shown that the source definition may be different in different classification scheme ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently based on a large number of emission - line galaxies from sloan digital sky survey , @xcite found that seyferts and liners form clearly separated branches on the optical diagnostic diagrams .",
    "they further derived a new empirical classification scheme , which cleanly separates seyferts and liners @xcite . to verify the classification of our sample , we have tried to re - classify our sources using their scheme and the line ratios collected from either @xcite or @xcite . for our original 27 liners and 28 seyfert galaxies , the re - classification shows that 32 sources are now liners and 23 sources are seyfert galaxies",
    ". specifically , we find that all original liners are still liners except for ugc 08696 , which was regarded as a liner in @xcite using @xcite classification scheme , now is a seyfert galaxy",
    ". this high fraction of liners remaining as liners is actually consistent with the comparisons made by @xcite between their scheme and others .",
    "most of liners in our sample were defined by @xcite scheme , and others by @xcite scheme in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the @xcite scheme actually is very similar to @xcite one . as @xcite stated that most of galaxies classed as liners in the @xcite scheme are also liners in their scheme . on the other hand , we find that six original seyfert galaxies ( ngc 2639 , ngc 2655 , ngc 3031 , ngc 4168 , ngc 4579 and ngc 4639 ) in our sample may be identified as liners with @xcite scheme . with these new identifications ,",
    "we then re - investigate our results .",
    "clearly , the new identification will not change the anti - correlation for whole sample of 55 sources .",
    "we find that the anti - correlation is still significant ( @xmath70 at @xmath71 confidence level ) if we only consider the 23 seyfert galaxies newly defined with @xcite scheme , and again there is no correlation ( @xmath53 at @xmath72 confidence level ) for newly classified 32 liners .",
    "we thus conclude that the re - classification does not change our results .",
    "usually , the bolometric luminosity can be estimated from the luminosity at a given band by applying a suitable bolometric correction .",
    "the commonly applied bolometric corrections have been determined from a mean energy distribution calculated from 47 luminous , mostly nearby quasars @xcite , in which @xmath36 . however , as pointed out by @xcite , the inclusion of ir emission , which is known to be re - processed from the ultraviolet ( uv ) , would overestimate the bolometric luminosity .",
    "moreover , the @xcite bolometric corrections were calculated from an x - ray selected sample of quasars , thus may underestimate the bolometric corrections in the x - ray band .",
    "in addition , the bolometric corrections were derived from an average quasar template spectrum , thus the dependence on luminosity of the bolometric corrections can not be obtained @xcite . in calculating the bolometric luminosity @xmath73 ,",
    "we have simply assumed @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the bolometric luminosity @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is just a multiple of the x - ray luminosity . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath40 depends on the shape of the sed , which could differ among high and low luminosity agn @xcite . indeed , the observed @xmath75 ratio ranges from 3 to 16 @xcite in llagns , and a lower value of @xmath76 was suggested at lower luminosities ( typical of seyfert galaxies , i.e. , @xmath77 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the variations of bolometric corrections on the luminosity was taken into account by @xcite , in which the agn template sed were constructed by using the well - known anticorrelation between the optical - to - x - ray spectral index and @xmath78 luminosity .",
    "@xcite also investigated the dependence of bolometric corrections on the luminosity with similar approach .",
    "both works shown that the bolometric correction varies among high and low luminosity agn .",
    "more recently , taking the variations in the disk emission in the ultraviolet ( uv ) into account , @xcite found evidence for very significant spread in the bolometric corrections , with no simple dependence on luminosity being evident .",
    "instead , a more well - defined relationship between the bolometric correction and eddington ratio in agn is suggested , with a transitional region at an eddington ratio of @xmath79 , below which the bolometric correction is typically 15 - 25 , and above which it is typically 40 - 70 .",
    "most recently , the increase in bolometric correction with eddington ratio is confirmed and refined by @xcite based on simultaneous optical to x - ray seds for 29 agn from the @xcite reverberation - mapped sample , with hard x - ray bolometric corrections of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "since the x - ray luminosity @xmath86 in our sample covers over four orders of magnitude , clearly the dependence of bolometric correction on the luminosity can not be ignored if it does exist .",
    "we then calculated the bolometric correction using the expression of @xcite in 2 - 10 kev band ( see their equation 2 ) .",
    "we find that the bolometric correction @xmath87 of most sources ( 51 of 55 sources ) range from 8 to 16 , and the average value of whole sample is about 11 .",
    "although the new calculated bolometric correction varies from source to source , we find our results are not changed , i.e. the anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is still significant . alternatively ,",
    "if a @xmath88 ratio of 10 is considered for all our llagn sources , then the eddington ratio would be a factor of 3 lower than those in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . again",
    ", this will not change our correlation results .",
    "it should be noted that the more accurate bolometric correction can be performed when the detailed sed of individual source is constructed .",
    "however , this is not available now .",
    "the adoption of a uniform value of @xmath75 ratio will introduce dispersion of @xmath89 relation in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the influence on the correlation caused from a uniform bolometric correction needs further exploration .",
    "while the x - ray emission may be from the compton process in corona in luminous agns , it is unclear in llagns .",
    "the fundamental plane of supermassive black hole activity derived from the combination of x - ray , radio luminosity and black hole mass , were used to constrain the origin of x - ray emission in llagns @xcite .",
    "however , the different scenarios were proposed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the radio through x - ray emission of llagns is attributed to synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet , similarly to the scenario proposed for xrbs in their low / hard state .",
    "in contrast , @xcite suggested a rediatively inefficient accretion flow as the origin for x - ray emission , and a relativistic jet for the radio emission .",
    "recently , it is proposed that in some individual sources the emission from a jet can be responsible for the x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while several pieces of evidence seem to favor an accretion - related x - ray origin for four liners in radio galaxies , a significant ( or even dominant ) contribution from the jet in the x - ray regime can not be excluded for some objects @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the x - ray photon index and the eddington ratio has been found in various occasions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite updated the @xcite work by including more highly luminous agns , and they confirmed that the hard x - ray photon index can be a good indicator of accretion rate .",
    "moreover , the authors claimed that a measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath90 can provide an estimate of @xmath91 and black hole mass with a mean uncertainty of a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "there are various explanations for the correlation found in luminous agns .",
    "the x - ray emission of luminous seyfert galaxies are usually explained by that the emission is produced by a disk - corona system , where uv soft photon from the accretion disk are comptonized and up - scattered into the hard x - ray band by a hot corona above the accretion disk @xcite . as the accretion rate increases , the disk flux to irradiate the corona increases",
    "this will cause the corona to cool more efficiently because of compton cooling , and so the hard x - ray slope will steepen with the increasing accretion rate @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the hot corona may become weak with increasing accretion rate .",
    "@xcite found two different accretion classes in seyfert galaxies and qsos through investigating the correlation between the x - ray photon index and the eddington ratio .",
    "the authors argued that two classes may correspond to adaf and thin disk accretion , respectively .",
    "while two distinct classes are apparent at the soft x - ray photon index and eddington ratio panel , it is not clear for the case of the hard x - ray photon index due to the lack of data .",
    "nevertheless , there are strong positive correlations between the hard x - ray photon index and the eddington ratio for the objects with asca data , and for only adaf class objects as well .",
    "to explain the trend of spectrum steepening with increasing accretion rate in adaf - class objects , they invoked the two - zone accretion disk , i.e. an outer standard thin disk and an inner adaf .",
    "however , we note that all of their adaf class objects have @xmath93 , which represent the luminous adaf objects compared to our objects . most recently from a large sample of 153 radio quiet quasars , @xcite confirmed the correlation between @xmath94 and both @xmath95 and @xmath96 , however they found the dependence is not monotonic .",
    "the change in the disk / corona structure was proposed by the authors as a possible explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence .",
    "our study differs from previous work in that we expand the eddington ratio down to very low region , @xmath97 , which is unexplored before .",
    "the striking result we find is that the anti - correlation between the hard x - ray photon index and the eddington ratio of llagns is apparently contrast with the positive one of luminous agns .",
    "this implies that the x - ray emission mechanism of llagns may be different from that of luminous agns . on the other hand ,",
    "the anti - correlation is consistent with that of xrbs at low / hard state @xcite . through a systematic spectral analysis for 10 xrbs in the low / hard states , using @xmath98 and @xmath99 data",
    ", @xcite explored the correlation between the hard x - ray photon index and luminosity .",
    "they found a clear anti - correlation both for the most frequent observed source xte j1550 - 564 and for the compiled data of all 10 xrbs when the 2 - 200 kev luminosity @xmath100 is less than @xmath101 , corresponding to about 1% of eddington limit for 10 solar mass black hole .",
    "recently , the similar anti - correlation was also found at x - ray luminosity below @xmath102 from the combined data of two stellar mass black hole x - ray sources , xte j1118 + 480 and xte j1550 - 564 @xcite .    though there are still debates , llagns are usually believed to be powered by radiatively inefficient accretion flows , such as adafs and their variants @xcite , instead of the standard geometrically thin optically thick accretion disk typically proposed as the accretion mechanism acting in the central regions of luminous agn @xcite .",
    "we find that the qualitative behavior of the correlation of llagns is consistent with the prediction of the spectra produced from adaf model for xrbs in low state @xcite . at these low accretion rates ,",
    "the comptonization of synchrotron photons by the hot gas in the adaf constitutes the dominant cooling mechanism . as the accretion rate increases",
    ", the optical depth of the adaf goes up causing a corresponding increase in the compton @xmath103-parameter .",
    "consequently , the high - energy part of the spectrum becomes harder and smoother , and the photon index in the hard x - ray band hardens ( see fig .",
    "3a of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the self - similar solution of adafs @xcite",
    ", the electron scattering optical depth @xmath104 can be expressed as @xmath105 where @xmath106 represents the viscosity parameter @xcite , @xmath107 is the accretion rate in eddington units , and @xmath108 is the radius in schwarzschild radii .",
    "the inverse compton spectra of soft photons by the thermal electrons can be expressed as @xcite @xmath109 with the spectral index @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is intensity , @xmath112 is the mean amplification of photon energy per scattering by the electrons with temperature @xmath113 and is dominantly determined by @xmath113 . applying the @xmath114 expression in equation ( 2 ) , we can get the spectral index @xmath115 , since the electron temperature @xmath113 is only weakly dependent of accretion rate .",
    "our results are thus qualitatively consistent with the theoretical expectations of inverse compton scattering in adafs .",
    "similarly , @xcite also predicted an anti - correlation between the x - ray spectral slope and the eddington - scaled luminosity based on adaf model for objects with low eddington ratio , in which the x - ray spectral slope is determined by the compton @xmath103-parameter . in view of the consistence of our result with the adaf model predictions , our result seems to suggest that the x - ray emission of llagns may originate from the comptonization process in adafs .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath113 in adafs is generally in the range @xmath116 k , and depends only weakly on the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , the x - ray emission of llagns in our concerned energy band 2 - 10 kev can be from both the comptonization and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum is cut off at @xmath117 , thus , @xmath118 is in the range from several tens to hundreds kev for the plasma with electron temperature @xmath119 k. this implies that the spectral index of bremsstrahlung emission from adafs is around @xmath120 in 2 - 10 kev , which however is in contrast with the observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we speculate that comptonization is dominant over the bremsstrahlung emission in 2 - 10 kev for our llagns . while our sample is optically defined and selected , some sources can be defined as radio galaxies based on the radio structure , such as ngc 1275 , ngc 315 , ngc 4261 and ngc 6251 being regarded as fr i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "it thus conceivable that the x - ray emission can be from jet , which previously has been proposed for general llagns @xcite .",
    "based on the analysis of time - averaged spectra combined with model - independent information from x - ray temporal and spectral variability , and with inter - band information for four liners hosted by radio galaxies , @xcite claimed that liners represent a very heterogeneous class , which may range from intrinsically low - luminosity objects ( in terms of eddington ratio ) , to objects potentially strongly absorbed , to brighter objects with properties more in line with seyfert galaxies . from an investigation on the x - ray emission mechanism using the coupled jet - adaf model for a sample of eight fr",
    "i radio galaxies , @xcite claimed that the x - ray emission of fr is are complex from source to source , and x - ray can be dominantly from adaf for luminous sources , and mainly from jet for the least luminous sources , however , can be a mixture of adaf and jet for moderate luminosity sources . more generally for llagns , @xcite predicted that the x - ray emission is dominated by the emission from the adaf when the x - ray luminosity of a system is above some critical value , however it will be dominated by the jet when it is below the critical value . the critical value of @xmath37 is claimed to be @xmath121 to @xmath122 , which varies from source to source .",
    "indeed , the x - ray emission of fr i galaxies ngc 315 @xcite and ngc 4261 @xcite were claimed to be dominated by adafs since the x - ray luminosity is relatively high . on the other hand , the jet origin x - ray emission was proposed for ngc 4374 @xcite and ngc 4594 @xcite due to the low x - ray luminosity @xmath123 .",
    "we find that five sources ( one seyfert galaxies and four liners ) in our sample have @xmath124 , therefore , the jet contribution in these sources probably can not be ignored based on the predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , these five sources well follow the general trend of @xmath125 in fig .",
    "this implies that the x - ray emission in these sources may also be dominated by adafs as other sources in our sample , though the jet emission can not be excluded .",
    "alternatively , to exclude the possible contamination of jet - origin x - ray emission in low eddington ratio liners and due to the fact that liners represent a very heterogeneous class ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we retry the correlation analysis for liners after excluding four liners with @xmath126 , of which a jet contribution in x - ray emission is expected @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath62 is still lack for remaining 23 liners ( @xmath127 at @xmath128 confidence level ) .",
    "the riaf model is an updated version of the adaf model , in which the winds are considered and a relatively high @xmath129 ( the fraction of the energy directly heating the electrons to the total viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow ) is adopted compared with the adaf model . the detailed physics of the putative winds is still quite unclear for riaf model , and therefore , our discussions is mainly based on the well studied adaf model . since the general observational features and structures of the adafs and riafs are quite similar , the main conclusions of this work will not be altered with the riaf model .    in summary , we propose that the x - ray emission of llagns may originate from the comptonization process in adafs , and llagns may be similar to xrbs at the low / hard state , where the accretion rate is low , and radiation from accretion flow is inefficient .",
    "the detailed fitting of the spectra of individual llagns with adaf - jet models should further clarify the mechanism of x - ray emission , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
