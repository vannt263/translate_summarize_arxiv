    "the radiation physics in the refined region was modeled via an effective equation of state , an ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath59 .",

    "the primary galaxy is a milky way - mass galaxy sampled with @xmath37 particles dark matter particles and ( initially ) @xmath71 star and @xmath72 gas particles .",
    "the secondary galaxy is obtained by rescaling the primary galaxy in mass by 1/4 or 1/10 of its mass , according to the scaling laws of @xcite for cdm galaxies , and is sampled by an equivalent number of particles as the primary . in the 1:10 merger , which is assumed to take place at @xmath73",

    "furthermore , the higher background density arising as inflows driven by tidal torques associated with bar instabilities and shocks push gas to the center of the galaxies during the merger and enhance dynamical friction in the late stages of the orbital decay @xcite . here",
    "we consider two such dissipational runs : a 1:4 merger with initial gas fraction @xmath70 , and a 1:10 merger with @xmath75 .",
    "both resulted in the formation of mbh pairs separated by twice the softening length ( 200 pc for the 1:4 merger and 40 pc for 1:10 ) , and it is expected that the holes will subsequently merge on a timescale @xmath77 1 gyr ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the galaxies used in the simulation were initialized with a mixture of primordial metallicities .",
    "the runs were performed with the gasoline code , including this time radiative cooling , atomic line cooling ( by h and he ) , and cooling via collisions , star formation , and blast - wave supernova feedback until the end of the simulation , rather than switching to an effective equation of state . the resulting interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "density distribution is clumpier than in the case of the major mergers that adopt an effective equation of state and neglect supernova explosions .",
    "0.3 cm    the most important difference between the major and the minor mergers , however , is that bar - driven torques are much weaker in the latter case .",
    "this is especially true in the primary galaxy , which is only weakly destabilized by the secondary : as a result , gas inflows are much weaker , and @xmath78 of the gas that was originally at large radii reaches the central hundred parsec region by the end of the merger , as opposed to more than @xmath79 in the case of major mergers .",
    "figure  [ rotation ] ( middle and right panels ) shows the rotation curves of the minor merger remnants .",
    "they include gas that will eventually form stars ; furthermore , heating and stirring by supernova feedback will make the gas more pressure - supported and extended .",
    "therefore , we expect the mbh return time in minor mergers to be largely determined by dynamical friction against the stars and the dark matter . in addition",
    ", the lower central densities imply a lower escape speed , so we expect that holes with a given kick velocity will travel larger distances in this case compared to a major merger .",
    "the escape speeds from the center in the perpendicular ( @xmath64 ) and parallel ( @xmath65 ) directions to the angular momentum vector of the gaseous disk are @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the 1:4 merger , respectively , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the 1:10 merger .",
    "we performed six simulations of recoiling mbhs in the 1:1 merger remnant of @xcite .",
    "a mbh binary of total mass @xmath84 was replaced with a single black hole of the same mass .",
    "the hole was given a kick of @xmath7 = 400 , 800 , and 1,200 @xmath8 at an angle @xmath85 or @xmath86 relative to the angular momentum of the disk . in section  [ kickvelocity ]",
    "we showed that maximum recoil velocities are of order @xmath50 if spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary . here",
    ", we make no assumptions regarding the spin orientation or the orientation of the binary orbital plane relative to the gaseous disk , since the main objective of the simulations is to calibrate the semi - analytical model described in section  [ model ] .",
    "however , these configurations will enter in the calculation of the probability of observing recoiling mbhs as off - nuclear agn during their wandering phase ( see section  [ detectability ] ) . for comparison , we have also run a simulation without the mbh .",
    "our gas mass resolution is @xmath87 , for a total of @xmath88 sph particles , and the gravitational softening is 10 pc for the mbh as well as the sph particles .",
    "the hole was kicked starting from where the binary was , at the center of mass of the gas distribution located some 20 pc away from the center of the potential .",
    "the simulations were run using gasoline , and were restarted using the same thermodynamical parameters as in the refined part of the @xcite simulation , i.e. the sph particles were treated as an ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath59 . since only a small fraction of the nuclear gas turns into stars during the timescale of the simulations , we neglect star formation to reduce the computational burden .",
    "we run the simulations for up to 50 myr , a compromise between obtaining a good calibration for our semi - analytical models and limit cpu time .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that mbhs moving in nuclear disks with varying mass fraction of stars produce a drag ( via dynamical friction ) that is almost indistinguishable from the purely gaseous case .",
    "it is gas thermodynamics instead that determines the magnitude of frictional drag in both purely gaseous or star forming disks , as it sets the density and temperature distribution of the gaseous disk @xcite .     in major merger remnant .",
    "the panels show a hole kicked with _ ( a ) _ @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( parallel to the gaseous disk plane ) , _ ( b ) _ @xmath89 and @xmath85 , _ ( c ) _ @xmath91 and @xmath90 , and _",

    "0.3 cm    it is important to emphasize that , in a model with an effective equation of state , the temperature should not be associated with the physical temperature of a specific phase of the interstellar medium in the nuclear disk , e.g. the molecular gas that makes up most of the disk mass @xcite , but rather with an effective pressure that provides a realistic match to the pressure scale height of the disk . in a realistic case",
    "the cold molecular phase is embedded in a hot ionized medium that fills most of the volume and sets the actual pressure scale height .",
    "the pressure scale height of our nuclear disk is @xmath9615 pc at the beginning of the simulations , and @xmath9621 pc at @xmath9720 myr , and compares well with the pressure scale height of 23 pc observed in mrk 231 @xcite .",
    "likewise , the effective sound speed used throughout the paper ( calculated directly from the simulations ) should be close to the sound speed of the hot , diffuse phase ( the cold molecular phase has a sound speed of @xmath98 ) .",

    "the orbit for the case @xmath91 and @xmath90 is shown again in figure [ orbit ] , together with the evolution of the background gas number density and specific internal energy .",
    "to obtain a large sample of mbh orbits at relatively low computational cost , we have constructed a semi - analytical model based on our numerical results .",

    "overdensities produced in the gas by the recoiling mbh are rapidly weakened .",
    "in contrast with the results of @xcite , the removal of the central hole from the disk potential does not have a significant effect on the central density profile , since the mass of the hole amounts to only @xmath145 of the mass of the nuclear disk . at the end of the major merger @xmath146 mbh simulation ,",
    "the gas density and internal energy profiles ( fig .  [ orbit ] ) are nearly undistinguishable from those in the no - mbh run .    by contrast , in the 1:10 merger , the integrated change in gas internal energy is comparable to the orbital energy lost by the mbh over a few tens of orbits .",
    "high mach numbers can be reached at lower recoil speeds since the sound speed profile rises slowly to reach @xmath147 at 50 pc and then stays constant out to 100 pc ( whereas in the major merger the sound speed reaches a peak of @xmath148 at 10 pc and then drops to @xmath149 at 100 pc ) .",
    "this suggests that minor merger remnants may be suitable sites for the detection of recoiling mbhs through their interaction with ambient material .",

    "the satellite galaxies will suffer severe tidal mass losses as dynamical friction reduces their pericentre distance : this will increase substantially their decay time @xcite and inhibit the formation of a mbh binary .",
    "a limitation of the present study is that our simulations do not capture all the phases of the ism : gas is either warm , with temperatures close to @xmath254 k , or hot ( @xmath255 k ) as a result of heating by supernovae explosions or shocks in the final collision of the merging galaxy cores .",

    "the finite resolution of our numerical simulations may also affect our results .",
    "in particular , the resolution of our 1:4 merger ( 200 pc ) results in a sharp decline of the gas distribution in the remnant nucleus . to quantify this effect",

    "we find that the recoiling mbhs in the 1:4 merger reach smaller apocenter distances and wander for even shorter timescales .",
    "the effect is more dramatic for kicks below @xmath50 . since mbhs with these velocities are not observable as neither kinematically nor spatially - offset agns , our detection probabilities remain largely unaffected .",
    "another important limitation of our semi - analytical modelling is the neglect of agn feedback , which acts to reduce the efficiency of frictional drag by heating the gas surrounding the recoiling mbh .",
    "recent work by @xcite shows that in simulations where agn feedback is fully included , the mbh creates a hot low - density ( instead of a high - density ) wake that expands away from the hole .",
    "the mbh describes a precessing elliptical orbit that tend to circularize , and decays towards the center of the remnant on a longer return timescale . to get a simple estimate of the effect of agn feedback on our calculations we have assumed in our semi - analytic model that at each time - step a fraction equal to 5% of the radiative energy produced by the accreting mbh goes directly towards increasing the local thermal energy of the gas .",
    "we find that in dense regions where the hole is accreting at high bondi rates , the reduction of the effective mach number from such energy deposition lengthen the return timescale by 15% in the major merger for @xmath256 and 20% for @xmath257 in the 1:10 merger .",
    "the time during which the mbhs are observable as spatially offset agn increases by 6% and 9% respectively .",
    "the overall detection probability however , remains low .",
    "furthermore , in our detectability calculations we have not included obscuration by dust .",
    "because theoptical and x - ray reddening does not depend on the orientation of the host galaxy @xcite , it is believed that most of the obscuration occurs in a region close to the mbh , with optical light being more strongly affected that x - rays and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the recent study of @xcite shows that the _ swift _ bat x - ray survey has revealed roughly 5 - 6 times more dual agns than the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) due to optical extinction and dilution by star formation . as a result",
    ", the detection probability is further reduced for _ hst / jwst _ sources .    while we have pointed out the low likelihood that moderate - to - large recoils can be observed , one possibly observable consequence of this phenomenon is the existence of a population of hot - dust - poor agns due to the removal of the mbh and associated blr from the surrounding hot dust region .",
