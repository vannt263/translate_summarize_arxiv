    "ultracool white dwarfs ( @xmath6 k ) have been of much interest to researchers in recent years for several reasons .",
    "first , it remains an unanswered question as to whether cool white dwarfs are a significant component of galactic halo dark matter @xcite .",
    "second , the ages and compositions of cool white dwarfs have obvious implications for the age and evolution of the disk , bulge and halo components of the galaxy .",
    "finally , the distribution and origins of atmospheric and core compositions of the coolest white dwarfs is still not well understood .    in this paper",

    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of gd392b strongly suggests flux deficiency redward of @xmath8 m , a @xmath9 k , and possibly a helium component in its atmosphere as well @xcite .",
    "tentative stellar parameters are derived for gd392b based on the data and different assumptions about the mass of the primary .",
    "possible implications based on the model fit parameters and similarities to known ultracool white dwarfs are then discussed .",
    "near infrared data on the gd392 system were obtained at lick observatory in june & august 2003 .",
    "@xmath10 images were acquired using the gemini camera @xcite on the 3 meter shane telescope .",
    "total observation time was 7.5 minutes at each filter , consisting of 15 second exposures in a repeated five point dither pattern .",

    ", both the flux and signal to noise ratio ( snr ) was calculated for a range of apertures from one to four full widths .",
    "the target flux was measured at or near the aperture size which produced the largest snr . in this way",
    "the flux of all targets was measured , including standard stars . a large aperture ( @xmath18 )",
    "was used for all calibrators , and flux measurements for science targets were corrected to this standard aperture to account for the smaller percentage of the total flux contained within apertures smaller than the standard .    extracting all photometry for gd392b",
    "was complicated by the presence of a nearby background star ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . in a single subtraction @xmath19 band image ,",
    "the separation between gd392b and background star was measured to be @xmath20 at a pa of @xmath21 . since even small aperture flux measurements of gd392b would be contaminated by light from the background star , the iraf package daophot was employed to fit the psf of both stars simultaneously and extract their magnitudes . since daophot is sensitive to the separation and brightness ratio of two sources with overlapping psfs , the optical and infrared data were broken into two sets ; primary data for which the full widths at half maximum in the reduced images were less than @xmath12 , and secondary data for which they were greater than or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "this is an especially important consideration in the infrared where the brightness ratio of gd392b and background star is far from unity .",
    "all photometric data are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] and the adopted values used for the analysis are listed in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the secondary data were not included in the analysis due to the uncertainty in psf fitting for sources separated by less than one full width at half maximum  the data are consistent with the adopted values to within @xmath22 and are included for completeness .",
    "conversions between near infrared filter sets were not performed for three reasons : 1 ) the corrections are typically very small @xcite ; 2 ) the colors of gd392b are drastically different from the colors of standard stars used to derive the transformations ; 3 ) the near infrared photometry errors in table [ tbl-1 ] are likely to be several times larger than any corrections .    due to the poor weather conditions , there was only a single nirc frame acquired with gd392b on the chip , three frames containing gd392a , and several sky frames . since the common proper motion system is separated by more than the @xmath23 field of view , the binary pair could not be observed simultaneously .",
    "the reduced images of the primary and secondary contained three field stars in common .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on these stars twice ; once with gd392a as a calibrator , and again using the three field stars as calibrators for gd392b and the background star .",
    "these intermediate calibrator stars had a standard deviation of only a few percent in their measured relative fluxes between the two reduced images . gd392b and",
    "the background star were spatially resolved from each other in this observation .",
    "the snr in the primary data set was greater than 30 for both stars in the reduced images at all wavelengths with the exception of the following . in the gemini images ,",
    "the snr was calculated to be 8.6 at @xmath24 , 3.7 at @xmath25 for gd392b ( from the extracted daophot data ) . in the nickel data ,",
    "the snr at @xmath26 was 11.4 for gd392b and 15.1 for the background star .",
    "in the single subtraction , flat fielded nirc @xmath13 frame , the snr for gd392b was 5.8 .",
    "a @xmath27 m spectrum was obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) @xcite in october 2003 at mauna kea on keck i by c. steidel , d. erb & n. reddy . the setup consisted of the 300/5000  grism on the blue side and the 400/8500  grating on the red side , separated at 6650  by a dichroic beamsplitter .",
    "the spectra of both stars were spatially resolved from each other in the observation .",
    "the spectral images were cleaned of bad pixels and cosmic rays , then flat fielded using an internal halogen lamp .",
    "a spectrum of the sky was extracted at two positions for each wavelength region , averaged , and then subtracted from the spectrum of each star .",
    "standard programs in iraf were used to extract the spectra of both gd392b and the background star .",
    "the lamp used to flat field the spectral images is itself spectrally nonuniform and has a strong rise from @xmath28  .",
    "hence , the instrument and chip response were removed by flat fielding but the remaining shape was a convolution of the stellar spectra and the `` flat '' lamp .",
    "the background star appears to be a k dwarf whose exact spectral type cannnot be established from photometry because its reddening is unknown and the low resolution spectrum precludes the line measurements necessary for a determination .",
    "spectra extracted without flat fielding confirm that the flux of both gd392b and k star rises toward the dichroic cutoff near 6600  ( a fact corroborated by the photometry ) . attempting to reconstruct the true shape of the continuua , the reduced spectra were multiplied by a blackbody with a temperature similar to that of the halogen flat lamp .",
    "this information was obtained from the manufacturer .",
    "the resultant spectra are shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ]",
    "a wide field , infrared proper motion survey for low mass stellar and substellar companions to nearby white dwarfs is being completed @xcite .",
    "because the observations are being conducted primarily at @xmath19 band ( @xmath29 m ) , the survey is particularly sensitive to cool objects such as late m , l and early t type dwarfs .",
    "a near infrared search is also sensitive to cool white dwarfs .",
    "this survey s sensitivity is slightly less for cool degenerates which suffer collision induced absorption ( cia ) opacity at this wavelength relative to those which do not . in general , common proper motion companions brighter than @xmath30 mag can be detected .    to measure proper motions and detect companions , geomap is used .",
    "this is a standard program in the iraf environment , which generates a transformation between two sets of coordinates corresponding to sources in the same field at two different epochs . in this way",
    "proper motion stars can be identified and their motions measured against the near zero motion of background stars and galaxies , which provide a measure of the standard error .    the common proper motion companion to gd392 ( wd2058 + 342 , greenstein 1984 ; greenstein & liebert 1990 , wesemael et al .",
    "1993 ) was detected in a routine examination of the digitized poss i & ii plates for confirming identity , proper motion and coordinates of the primary for a finder chart prior to an observing run .",
    "a simple blinking of poss i and poss ii frames reveals the comoving companion at a separation of @xmath31 and a pa of @xmath32 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "measurement of proper motion between poss epochs reveals that both gd392a and b have the same proper motion over a 41 year baseline , namely @xmath33 @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , astrometric analysis of 2003 infrared images confirms that the separation and pa between primary and secondary have remained constant since 1951 .",
    "the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite gives a proper motion of @xmath36 @xmath34 at @xmath37 for gd392 and no value is given for the companion .",
    "@xcite published a detected proper motion of @xmath38 @xmath34 at @xmath39 for the primary .",
    "both of these measurements are consistent with the value presented in this paper .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the unchanging position angle of the pair over several epochs .    at a nominal distance of 50 pc ( see  4.2 ) , the proper motion of the pair gives @xmath40 km @xmath41 and thus there is no reason to suspect this system is not a member of the local disk population .",
    "despite some relatively low snr photometry on gd392b in the near infrared , there are seven independent measurements at these longer wavelengths , three of these at @xmath42 m ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) . in stark contrast with the similar optical magnitudes and colors ,",
    "gd392b appears roughly 1.0 magnitude fainter than the nearby background k star at @xmath43 m , 2.0 magnitudes fainter at @xmath44 m , and 2.5 magnitudes fainter at @xmath42 m in all the measurements .",
    "the optical and infrared colors of gd392b point strongly towards an ultracool white dwarf with strong cia longward of @xmath8 m .",
    "no other stellar object could be so red in @xmath45 and yet blue in @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum confirms that gd392b is a featureless dc star ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "hence gd392b must be a very cool white dwarf .",
    "plotting gd392b on a @xmath45 vs. @xmath47 color - color diagram , one sees that it is located beyond the turnoff for log @xmath48 pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs , which corresponds to @xmath2 k ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "there are only three other ultracool white dwarfs in the literature for which infrared photometry is available , wd0346 + 246 , lhs3250 and sdss1337 + 00 @xcite .",
    "gd392b s optical colors are strikingly similar to those of wd0346 + 246 @xcite .",
    "although they have almost identical optical colors , gd392b appears to have more flux in the near infrared than does wd0346 + 246 . from recent model atmosphere analyses of the three aforementioned stars ,",
    "it is possible that gd392b is warmer , has different gravity , and/or contains a different ratio of hydrogen to helium in its atmosphere than does wd0346 + 246 @xcite .",
    "the best way to estimate the temperature of gd392b is to fit models to the @xmath17 photometry . to evaluate its sed",
    ", the magnitudes were converted into isophotal or average fluxes , following the method of @xcite .",
    "different fits to the data were tried using the pure hydrogen and mixed h / he atmosphere model grids of p. bergeron ( 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "as in the case of wd0346 + 246 @xcite , pure hydrogen and mixed atmosphere models fail to reproduce the sed of gd392b in detail .",
    "and like @xcite , a low gravity solution appears to provide a decent fit to the data .",
    "in fact , every solution at log @xmath49 seems to provide optical colors that are too blue ( too much cia ) , or infrared colors that are too red ( too little cia ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig6 ] , a decent fit is acheived at log @xmath50 , @xmath51 k , and @xmath52 .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig6 ] is a blackbody of the same temperature scaled to the peak flux of gd392b  relative to the blackbody , the sed of gd392b appears suppressed at wavelengths longer than 8000  and enhanced at shorter wavelengths .",
    "because gd392b is a companion to a previously studied white dwarf , it should be possible to deduce the distance to this system and use it to constrain stellar radius @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "one must keep in mind that the model predicted temperature of gd392b will depend on its mass and atmospheric composition and thus can not be known exactly at present . in ",
    "4.2 a range of possibilities is explored .      using basic relations between luminosity and flux",
    ", one can calculate a radius for gd392b if its distance and @xmath55 are known . to obtain a distance , the @xmath17 photometry of the primary ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) , gd392 ,",
    "was fitted with pure helium model grids ( p. bergeron 2002 , private communication ) and its measured sed was integrated directly .",
    "the model fit provides a @xmath55 , and integrating the sed of gd392 yields a total flux .",
    "a radius must be specified in order to calculate a distance to the primary .",
    "the model fit to the sed of gd392 does not provide a radius determination because the colors of a db star are largely unaffected by gravity .",
    "hence one is forced to make various assumptions for log @xmath56 .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] lists stellar parameters for gd392 with various gravities , and thus distances . in the literature ,",
    "gd392 has been noted as a db5 @xcite , dba?4 @xcite and finally a db5 again while explicitly stating `` revised from @xcite '' @xcite .",
    "the optical and infrared photometric data presented here are more consistent with a db4 than a db5 .",
    "good agreement between model and measured colors is acheived at @xmath57 k ( regardless of log @xmath56 ) , which actually corresponds to db4.5 .",
    "this is the temperature used in all calculations for the parameters of gd392 .",
    "for each distance estimate to the gd392 system , there is an analytic constraint on @xmath58 for gd392b .",
    "it is also critical that the model predicted parameters , such as @xmath54 , optical and infrared colors corresponding to each combination of @xmath53 and @xmath55 , fit the photometric data on gd392b .",
    "if gd392 is an average mass white dwarf ( log @xmath48 ) , a solution is found almost identical to the preliminary fit in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "that is , at 57.8 pc gd392b must have a temperature near 3500 k and a very large radius  either an unresolved binary or a low mass white dwarf .",
    "this model fit is consistent with the measured colors ( excepting @xmath59 , see  4.3 ) and matches the absolute magnitude of the secondary at this distance ; in fact , only a low gravity solution appears to provide such agreement between measured and predicted fluxes . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , four fits are shown satisfying the @xmath54 constraint at 57.8 pc for a range of gravities .",
    "it is clear that only the log @xmath50 fit comes near to matching the photometry .",
    "although these fits have all been scaled to match the flux at @xmath60 m , the obvious discrepancies of the higher gravity solutions occur at any scaling ; they predict too little flux in the optical or too much flux in the near infrared .",
    "in addition , the log @xmath61 fits do not satisfy the @xmath58 constraint at this distance .",
    "this scenario is instructive for two reasons .",
    "one is that there is no independent reason to suspect that gd392 is anything but an average mass white dwarf . in fact , the spectroscopic mass distribution of db stars peaks at @xmath62 , with a very small dispersion of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the other reason is the failure of the higher gravity fits to match the data persists for any reasonable distance estimate .    assuming the primary is a higher than average mass white dwarf ( log @xmath64 ) results in serious discrepancies between model predicted and measured colors for gd392b .",
    "this disagreement appears to be insensitive to the type of atmosphere in the models . shown in figure [ fig8 ]",
    "is a model fit for gd392b at 40.4 pc .",
    "higher gravity solutions at this distance or closer are worse and are not shown for the sake of brevity .",
    "problems arise as well if one assumes the primary is a lower than average mass white dwarf ( log @xmath65 ) .",
    "this leads to extreme low gravity solutions for gd392b and the models used here do not include gravities below log @xmath50 .",
    "table [ tbl-4 ] lists all resulting fits for gd392b .",
    "while the possibility exists that gd392b is an unresolved binary or helium core white dwarf , this is uncertain until the distance to the system is known with sufficient precision and a good model fit to its sed is achieved .",
    "it seems very unlikely that gd392b could have a such an unusually low mass as @xmath66 , but it can not be ruled out either .",
    "it is conceivable that a good model fit with a much higher @xmath55 ( hence predicting a smaller radius and a larger mass ) could show good agreement with the measured colors of gd392b .",
    "all models used here do not give such agreement .",
    "a parallax measurement of the primary is currently in progress ( h. harris 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "all attempts to fit the sed of gd392b with mixed h / he atmosphere models having @xmath67 are problematic .",
    "in fact , for all temperatures and gravities , the same problem mentioned previously occurs ; colors too blue in the optical and/or too red in the infrared to fit the measured photometry , given the absolute magnitude constraint .",
    "the only possible exception being the pure hydrogen models at log @xmath50 . shown in figure [ fig9 ] are several model fits with varying ratios of h / he for the lowest gravity case",
    ". only the pure hydrogen and the @xmath52 models provide any kind of decent fit to the data .",
    "however , the pure hydrogen fit has one minor fault when compared to the mixed atmosphere fit  it predicts an @xmath54 corresponding to 57.8 pc but does not precisely fit the @xmath58 constraint .",
    "the @xmath52 , @xmath68 k solution comes very close to hitting all the data points except @xmath26 and satisfies all constraints surprisingly well at 57.8 pc .",
    "there currently exists a discrepancy between model predicted and measured @xmath26 band fluxes  this wavelength is excluded from fits to the energy distributions of very cool hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that gd392b appears to be the first ultracool white dwarf for which a pure hydrogen atmosphere is not inconsistent with the data .",
    "at present there remains a general failure by model predictions to fit the photometric observations of ultracool white dwarfs in detail @xcite  a fact exemplified by gd392b .",
    "another case in point is the sed of wd0346 + 246 , where both @xcite and @xcite found that a mixed atmosphere model with an extremely low value of @xmath69 provides a good fit to the data .",
    "but because of the unlikelihood and volatility of such a solution , @xcite introduced a pseudocontinuum opacity characterized by an ad hoc damping function .",
    "although a good fit with @xmath70 was achieved when the opacity was added to the models , it is unclear whether this pseudocontinuum source plays a significant physical role in the atmospheres of ultracool white dwarfs .",
    "therefore , it is not yet possible to determine the atmospheric parameters of the coolest degenerates with confidence .",
    "it should be mentioned that with the possible exception of the ultracool white dwarfs in figure [ fig5 ] , all suspected or confirmed low mass white dwarfs have hydrogen rich atmospheres @xcite .",
    "hence a model fit to the photometry of gd392b with low mass and a mixed h / he atmosphere is inconsistent with these findings .",
    "gd392b is not the first or even the second ultracool white dwarf for which an apparent large radius is possible or likely .",
    "lhs3250 , wd0346 + 246 and sdss1337 + 00 _ all appear to be potentially overluminous _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , the best fits acheived by @xcite to wd0346 + 246 and f351 - 50 were with log @xmath71 , although for pure hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "these solutions are problematic because they predict temperatures below 3000 k and such extreme low gravities . although unlikely , the present possibility that these ultracool degenerate stars have anomalously low mass can not be ruled out . white dwarfs with @xmath72",
    "have relatively large radii and are understood to be the product of close binary evolution ; their post main sequence lifetimes cut short before helium burning begins @xcite . on the other hand , the potential overluminosity of these stars can be explained equally well by binary membership with a white dwarf companion of comparable luminosity .",
    "if this is correct , the gd392 system would then be the second known triple degenerate . in either case , binarity is a strong possibility for most if not all four objects in figure [ fig5 ] , if the models are correct .",
    "is it possible that the discovery of these stars represents a luminosity detection bias ?",
    "this would imply all known ultracool degenerates were detected because they are relatively bright compared to normal to high gravity single white dwarfs with comparable temperatures . in fact , the faintest white dwarf known , eso439 - 26 @xcite , has an extremely high mass ( log @xmath73 ) , a temperature around 4500 k , and @xmath74  just above the detection limit of very large sky surveys like the serc / eso survey in the southern hemisphere and the palomar survey ( poss ii ) in the north @xcite .",
    "what if eso439 - 26 had @xmath51 k instead of @xmath75 k ?",
    "would it have still been detected ?",
    "almost certainly not , since models predict it would have been too faint at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a similar calculation was performed for gd392b , assuming it is a 3500 k mixed h / he atmosphere degenerate with log @xmath50 at 57.8 pc .",
    "would it still have been detected were it a higher mass white dwarf with log @xmath78 ?",
    "likely not at @xmath79 and @xmath80 which is just beyond the poss ii red plate limit and right at the blue plate limit .",
    "it probably would not have been detected in the infrared at @xmath81 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for wd0346 + 246 at @xmath82 , but possibly not lhs 3250 at @xmath83 .",
    "if we similarly push back the magnitude of sdss1337 + 00 to @xmath84 it would still be detectable in the sloan survey but not on the poss ii plates .",
    "the claim that all known ultracool white dwarfs are overluminous is not being made here .",
    "it is simply being stated that _ if _ the majority of them are indeed brighter than expected due to low gravity or binarity , then all surveys with the exception of sloan have been biased against detecting average to higher mass single white dwarfs at the very bottom of the disk cooling sequence . in fact",
    ", one should expect that the oldest white dwarfs  those which spent very little time on the main sequence  would have come from fairly massive progentiors .",
    "furthermore , the initial mass to final mass relation for white dwarfs indicates that higher mass main sequence stars tend to form higher mass degenerates @xcite .",
    "this implies that the oldest and least luminous white dwarfs should have high masses , small radii , and be up to 2.4 magnitudes fainter than a low mass white dwarf with the same temperature .",
    "hence there is a possibility that the lowest luminosity disk white dwarfs have yet to be detected .",
    "of course the other possibility ( and , according to occam s razor , the most likely ) is simply a failure of the current models to explain the photometric observations .",
    "also , in this case , the data do not constrain the mass of gd392 and therefore we do not know distance to the system . despite the fact that the model predictions fail to reproduce the colors of gd392b in all but the log @xmath50 case , it is certainly possible that it has a higher mass .",
    "this can not be ruled out and future improvements in models may result in the disappearance of the overluminosity issue .",
    "spectroscopy and photometry confirm a cool dc white dwarf common proper motion companion to gd392 .",
    "it is the first ultracool white dwarf ( @xmath6 k ) to be discovered as a companion to another star .",
    "although the primary is a well studied db white dwarf , gd392 does not have a mass estimate , nor any kind of reliable parallax .",
    "in fact , its helium lines are very weak @xcite and therefore it is not possible to spectroscopically determine its mass .",
    "neither is it possible to photometrically determine its mass because the optical and infrared colors of relatively hot helium atmosphere white dwarfs are insensitive to gravity .",
    "therefore the distance to the gd392 system is not well constrained and the parameters we derive for gd392b must come from a range of assumed values for the mass of the primary .    despite this difficulty , it appears that all model fits fail to reproduce the sed of gd392b with the exception of a solution with log @xmath50 , @xmath68 k , and @xmath85 ( or similar values with pure hydrogen ) .",
    "it is the only set of parameters for which the model predicted fluxes fall within @xmath86 of all but one photometric data point and which satisfies all constraints .",
    "however , the model fit alone is not sufficient to conclude that gd392b is overluminous .",
    "it is possible that current models simply can not reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution of gd392b with a normal to higher surface gravity , but perhaps ongoing and future improvements will .",
    "based on the data and the models used here , along with the published analyses of similar objects , gd392b may be an unresolved binary with a companion of comparable luminosity or is itself a low mass white dwarf .",
    "albeit unlikely , this could also be the case for other known ultracool degenerates .",
    "if correct , this may hold interesting consequences for the population of stars at the faint end of the local disk white dwarf luminosity function .",
