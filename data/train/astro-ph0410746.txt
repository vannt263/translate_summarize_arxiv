    "alma will be a flexible observatory supporting a breath of research in the fields of planetary , galactic and extra - galactic astronomy .",
    "the three primary science requirements have been defined as :    1 .",
    "the ability to detect spectral line emission from co or ci in a normal galaxy like the milky way at a redshift of @xmath2 , in less than 24 hours of observation .",
    "2 .   the ability to image the gas kinematics in protostars and protoplanetary disks around young sun - like stars at a distance of 150  pc , enabling one to study their physical , chemical and magnetic field structures and to detect the gaps created by planets undergoing formation in the disks .",
    "3 .   the ability to provide precise images at an angular resolution of 0.^ @xmath01 . here",
    ", the term precise images means representing within the noise level the sky brightness at all points where the brightness is greater than 0.1% of the peak image brightness .",
    "this requirement applies to all sources visible to alma that transit at an elevation greater than 20 .",
    "we now concentrate on the two requirements important for extragalactic astronomy ( see j. richer s contribution for the galactic requirements ) .",
    "an estimate of the technical requirements to achieve this science goal can be made by using experience learned from existing millimeter arrays , which have collecting areas between 500 and 1000  m@xmath3 .",
    "these arrays now routinely detect co emission from high redshift galaxies and quasars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "fainter molecular lines such as hcn ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and atomic carbon @xcite are now also within the reach of existing telescopes .",
    "these observations take one to two days of total observing time , and are only possible for the most luminous sources and/or with the aid of gravitational lensing . in normal , unlensed galaxies , these lines would be a factor of 20 to 30 fainter .",
    "the sensitivity of alma for a given integration time is essentially controlled by three major terms : ( 1 ) the atmospheric transparency , ( 2 ) the noise performance of the detectors , and ( 3 ) the total collecting area .",
    "the location of alma on the chajnantor plateau at an altitude of 5000 m will minimize the contribution from the atmosphere compared to existing millimeter observatories .",
    "the noise level of the detectors can be reduced be a factor of two , and will then approach the fundamental quantum limit . an important factor of @xmath4 will be gained by the requirement that alma support front end instrumentation capable of measuring both states of polarization .",
    "the remaining factor of 7 to 10 can only be gained by increasing the collecting area .",
    "hence , an alma requirement is a collecting area @xmath57000  m@xmath3 .",
    "a more specific calculation of the requirement to have the ability to detect co emission from a milky way type galaxy at @xmath1=3 is as follows . at cosmological distances ,",
    "the 10kpc disk of the milky way is much smaller than the primary beam of existing millimeter antennas , so a single observation would be sufficient .",
    "the flux density sensitivity in an image from an interferometric array can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the system temperature , @xmath8 is the aperture efficiency , @xmath9 is the correlator quantization efficiency , @xmath10 is the antenna diameter , @xmath11 is the number of simultaneously sampled polarizations , @xmath12 is the number of antennas , @xmath13 is the bandwidth , @xmath14 is the integration time , and @xmath15 is a gridding parameter that we set to unity . for alma , we shall assume @xmath9=0.95 , @xmath11=2 , and @xmath16 so this equation then simplifies to @xmath17    @xmath7 and @xmath8 vary between the different atmospheric bands of alma . a surface accuracy of 20@xmath18 m should be achievable , providing aperture efficiencies between 0.75 and 0.45 ( see table  [ table : eff+tsys ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 depends on several atmospheric and instrumental parameters .",
    "table  [ table : eff+tsys ] lists estimates of the achievable @xmath7 at an elevation of 50  using state - of - the - art receivers . with these assumptions",
    ", one can thus calculate the required collecting area parametrized by the product @xmath19 to achieve a certain flux density level .",
    ".aperture efficiencies @xmath8 and estimated system temperatures @xmath7 for alma at 50elevation . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : requirements ]",
    "in order provide a set of high - priority alma projects that could be carried out in @xmath2034 years of full alma operations , a design reference science plan ( drsp ) has been set up .",
    "the drsp contains 128 projects written by 43 experts in four scientific categories ( galaxies and cosmology , star and planet formation , stars and their evolution , solar system ) .",
    "these projects assume the full array of 64 antennas , which will be available by 2012 .",
    "the scientific goals will of course evolve over time , so these projects may become slightly outdated by this time .",
    "the main goal of the drsp is to serve as a quantitative reference for developing the science operations plan , for performing imaging simulations , and for software design .",
    "these provide a useful overview of alma s capabilities in these four domains .",
    "the drsp does * not * form the basis for any definition of alma early science observing programs , nor for any claims on key or other projects . here",
    "we illustrate an example extragalactic project doing molecular line studies of submm galaxies .",
    "co as a function of redshift .",
    "note that at each redshift , there will be at least one co line that can be detected with alma . at @xmath21",
    ", one can even detect two transitions within band  3.[fig : coladders ] ]    the discovery of a significant population of dusty star forming galaxies at high redshift from deep ( sub)mm surveys made with the scuba and mambo bolometer arrays has transformed our knowledge of galaxy formation ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sources make up at least half of the fir / submm background @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction ( of order 50% ) of star formation in the cosmos occurs in these galaxies that are heavily obscured by dust .",
    "the optical / near - ir identification is extremely time - consuming , and often requires ultra - deep radio maps to narrow down the large positional uncertainty of the ( sub)mm positions @xcite . as a result , the redshift distribution is still not properly determined , although the median redshift is claimed to be close to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "alma will not only provide sub - arcsecond resolution images of these sources , solving the optical identification problem , but will also allow to bypass the optical spectroscopy altogether .",
    "the limited bandwidth of present - day mm interferometers means that accurate optical redshifts are needed before one can confirm the redshift by observing the co lines @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath234  ghz bandwidth of alma allows one to detect at least one co transition in three frequency settings between 90 and 116 ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coladders ] ) . a second search will then be required to confirm the redshift .",
    "the two co lines will also provide estimates of co excitation conditions . for sources with 850@xmath18 m continuum flux densities of 1mjy ( which would be found with second generation bolometer arrays such as scuba-2/jcmt or laboca / apex ) , alma would have a solid detection in @xmath242hours integration time per source , so it is feasible to observe a representative sample of 50 sources in 100 hours .",
    "these sources can the be followed up with high resolution co images to determine their composition ( many sources are expected to be in mergers ) , and to derive dynamical mass estimates from their velocity profiles ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "such studies require only 1 hour per source , compared to 24 hours or more for brighter sources known today .",
    "finally , the hcn line , which is typically 10@xmath23 fainter than co will be detectable in about 10 hours with alma .",
    "this will provide a much better tracer of the dense gas feeding the star - formation in these galaxies .",
    "most of this paper is based on the draft alma scientific specification and requirements in the version by al wooten and tom wilson , with important contributions from bryan butler .",
