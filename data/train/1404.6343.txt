    "in physics , the boundary condition is often treated as a secondary issue .",
    "similar to the term itself , boundary conditions remain peripheral , never central . in string theory",
    ", however , the boundary condition plays a fundamental role .",
    "certain boundary conditions of the worldsheet exhibit non - perturbative aspects of string theory through d - branes .",
    "they also distinguish between open and closed strings , which correspond to gauge theories and gravity , respectively .",
    "this short note concerns the boundary conditions in string theory .    in recent studies of a certain class of quantum systems , systems with closed and open boundary conditions",
    "were found to have identical vacua provided that the coupling constants of the open - boundary system are modulated in a way called _ sine - square deformation _ ( ssd ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , ssd works for two - dimensional conformal field theories , which describe the worldsheets of string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the implications of this discovery to string theory are potentially vast",
    ".    the spatial modulation of the coupling constant is seldom investigated in condensed matter physics .",
    "however , such modulation may correspond to introducing a metric with non - trivial curvature . in this sense",
    ", the above - mentioned uncovering can be interpreted as an effect caused by the worldsheet metric .",
    "thus , by investigating the effect of the ssd on the worldsheet , we may better understand the non - perturbative aspects of string theory such as d - branes or open / closed duality through interchanges of the boundary condition caused by the worldsheet metric . specifically ,",
    "if certain worldsheet metrics can alter the boundary condition , resulting in d - brane emission or transitions between open and closed strings , then non - perturbative aspects of string theory can be understood from the dynamics of the worldsheet through its condensation .",
    "although , the worldsheet metric can be gauged away in the perturbative treatment of string theory , the metric may couple to the dynamics when non - perturbative effects are incorporated .",
    "the boundary condition , by nature , stipulates the development of a system , not the other way around .",
    "once set up , a system only evolves within its pre - determined boundary .",
    "therefore , if non - perturbative effects of string theory are depicted in terms of boundary conditions , they remain unaltered throughout the system development . here",
    "we explore a possibility that the condensation of the worldsheet metric effectively alter the boundary condition , thereby exhibiting non - perturbative effects of string dynamics .",
    "if this is the case , non - perturbative aspects of string theory can be understood in terms of worldsheet metric dynamics .",
    "in fact , one could argue that this has been somewhat achieved by the research through matrix models @xcite , in which the effects of d - branes were identified .",
    "noting that the matrix models are nothing but the statistical mechanics of the discretized worldsheet , here we rather seek a continuum treatment of the world sheet based on the ssd .",
    "in this note , we attempt to clarify the role of the world sheet metric in the non - perturabative dynamics of string theory . to this end",
    ", we explore the consequences of the ssd on the worldsheet .",
    "ssd is briefly overviewed in section [ sec : ssd ] , and it is applied to conformal field theory in subsection [ sec : sl2cvac ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : nont ] , we verify that the ssd is actually a non - trivial transformation . a novel state in the deformed system",
    "is presented in subsection [ sec : anovac ] .",
    "we examine the ssd in the lagrangian formalism in section [ sec : ssdstring ] . here , we reveal large divergence of the worldsheet metric .",
    "we conclude with notes and future perspectives in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "first , we explain the ssd introduced by gendiar , krcmar and nishino @xcite . consider a system of @xmath0 quantum operators @xmath1 .",
    "the operators are aligned one - dimensionally and each is connected to the next neighbors with the strength @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is given by @xmath3        the boundary condition of the system is governed by the configuration of the couplings @xmath2 .",
    "setting @xmath4 with @xmath5 , the system retains an open - boundary condition . on the other hand , if @xmath6 , a closed - boundary condition is imposed ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .",
    "now suppose that the couplings are configured so that they gradually vary .",
    "for example , in the open boundary system , we may reduce the strength of the couplings for the connections near both ends of the system ( fig .",
    "[ frem ] ) .",
    "we refer to this type of spatial coupling variation as modulation . such modulation ( illustrated in figure [ frem ] ) is motivated by the expectation that it reduces repercussions arising from the open boundaries .",
    "however , how far we should extend the coupling modulation remains an interesting question .        in @xcite",
    ", this step was boldly extended to the midpoint ( see fig . [ f3 ] ) .",
    "this modulation is expressed as @xmath7 note that the couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 located at the both ends are retained at @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the system remains an open - boundary system , but its couplings are modulated by ( [ ssddef ] ) . for obvious reasons , modulation ( [ ssddef ] )",
    "is called sine - square deformation ( ssd ) .",
    "an astonishing feature of ssd is that it permits a ground state of the modulated system that is identical to the ground state of a closed - boundary system .",
    "namely , the ground state of a certain class of quantum operators coupled by ( [ ssddef ] ) coincides with that of the system with @xmath6 .",
    "given the apparently very different topologies of these configurations , this is a remarkable result .",
    "this exact match between the ground states of the ssd system and that of the closed - boundary system is observed in spin-@xmath11 xy spin - chain , 1d free fermion systems , 2d conformal field theories and 2d super conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is also expected in spin-@xmath11 xxz spin - chain @xcite , extended hubbard model@xcite and kondo lattice model @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon can be understood as follows @xcite . in additions to the original hamiltonian ( [ h0general ] ) under the closed boundary condition",
    "@xmath12 we introduce two `` hamiltonians '' : @xmath13 the ssd can then be formulated by replacing the original @xmath14 in ( [ hclosed ] ) with the new hamiltonian : @xmath15 indeed , @xmath16 the @xmath17 factor in ( [ ssdspin ] ) clearly implies an open boundary for the sine - square deformed hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "this openness detaches the coupling between the operators at both ends , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    denoting the ground state of the original hamiltonian by @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ground energy . in certain systems",
    ", @xmath24 annihilates the ground state of the original hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath25 yielding @xmath26 if the energy spectrum of @xmath27 can be shown to be bounded below as for 1d fermions and certain conformal field theories ( cfts ) , the ground state @xmath21 is obviously an exact ground state of @xmath27 . in some cases , we can directly argue that @xmath27 has a unique ground state that corresponds to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in this subsection , the ssd and its mechanism are further explained in the context of 2d cft . following @xcite",
    ", we first express the hamiltonian of a cft on a cylinder of circumference @xmath29 in terms of the energy momentum tensor with the cylindrical coordinate @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32.\\ ] ] the energy momentum tensor @xmath33 comprises virasoro generators @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the cft can also be expressed as@xmath36    as in the previous section , we introduce @xmath37 , @xmath38 note that , for 2d cfts , @xmath37 can be written as a linear combination of familiar virasoro operators @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath27 now reads @xmath40    as for the ground state of 2d cft , it is natural to assume the @xmath28 invariance . denoting the @xmath28 invariant vacuum @xmath21 , we require that @xmath21 is invariant under the global conformal transformations generated by @xmath41 . from ( [ h0 ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath42 with @xmath43 . from ( [ hssd ] ) , we observe that @xmath21 is also a ground state of @xmath27 , with half the energy @xmath23 @xmath44 because @xmath21 is annihilated not only by @xmath45 and @xmath46 but also by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this analysis demonstrates the ssd mechanism in the more familiar setting of 2d conformal field theories .      at this point",
    ", it would be reasonable to question the non - triviality of @xmath27 .",
    "this hamiltonian differs from the original @xmath49 only by the generators of the global conformal transformations , @xmath50 .",
    "since the vacuum is assumed to be invariant under the @xmath28-transformations or global conformal transformations , a hamiltonian or any other operator can be modified by the @xmath28-transformations with no physical consequences .",
    "in fact , we apply the following @xmath28- transformation to ( the holomorphic part of)@xmath51 to obtain @xmath52 the above result appears similar to the right - hand side of ( [ hssd ] ) .",
    "if @xmath27 can be obtained from @xmath49 by the @xmath28-transformations , the matching of the ground states is trivial .",
    "closer inspection reveals that this is not the case .",
    "if the right - hand side of ( [ l0tolpm ] ) accords with @xmath27 , we need to require @xmath53 , which directly contradicts the identity @xmath54 .",
    "one may take the limit as @xmath55 and suitably rescale ; however , in any case , @xmath27 and @xmath51 are not connected through the ordinary @xmath28-transformation .",
    "this result can also be generally confirmed by considering the two - dimensional representations of the generators : @xmath56 a @xmath28 group element is non - unitarily represented by the products of the exponents of the following generators : @xmath57 which multiply to yield : @xmath58 in this representation , the @xmath28 group acts on @xmath45 as follows @xmath59 we now explore the parameter region in which the above expression can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; @xmath62 combining ( [ sl2rep ] ) , ( [ l0sl2ed ] ) and ( [ l0l+lincomb ] ) , the following conditions are easily obtained : @xmath63 the left - hand side of the following identity inequality @xmath64 can be expanded as @xmath65 yielding @xmath66 where we have used the first and second conditions in ( [ abcond ] ) .",
    "the case of interest is @xmath67 , which implies that a @xmath28 action on @xmath45 or @xmath51 yields @xmath68 up to a normalization .",
    "however , ( [ abqeq0 ] ) becomes an equality only when @xmath69 , which directly contradicts the third condition in ( [ abcond ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have proven by contradiction that @xmath28 can not act on @xmath51 to yield @xmath68 .",
    "action on @xmath14 might yield @xmath68 . ]",
    "[ footnote : uqsl2 ]    in fact , we can construct the transformation from @xmath45 to @xmath70 on the riemann surface explicitly and confirm that it lies outside @xmath28 , as follows . since virasoro operators can be expressed on the riemann surface as @xmath71 , @xmath72 while @xmath73 in a different complex variable on the riemann surface .",
    "then , the transformation takes @xmath45 to @xmath70 is nothing but the transformation from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath76 that equates eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssdz ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0u ] ) .",
    "one finds the explicit form of the transformation as @xmath77 which contains an essential singularity .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : uz ] ) is obviously different from the @xmath28 transformation , which should have been expressed as @xmath78 .",
    "further analysis utilizing the explicit formula ( [ eq : uz ] ) will be reported in future publication .      in subsection",
    "[ sec : sl2cvac ] , the @xmath28 invariant vacuum @xmath21 was shown to also constitute the lowest - energy @xmath79 eigenstate of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we may naturally seek other eigenstate of @xmath27 .",
    "for the original hamiltonian @xmath49 , there exists a set of eigenstates corresponding to primary fields of cft : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a primary field of dimensions @xmath82 and @xmath83 . unlike @xmath21",
    ", @xmath84 is not an eigenstate of @xmath27 , but provides a useful starting point . consider a state of the form @xmath85 where we have focused on the holomorphic part for simplicity .",
    "simple calculation shows that for ( [ eqn : seriesh ] ) to be an eigenstate of @xmath27 , @xmath86 the following recurrence relation for @xmath87 should hold : @xmath88 a solution to the above recurrence relation is @xmath89 thus , we appear to have identified vacuums other than @xmath21 of the form @xmath90 however , since the norm of ( [ evv ] ) is divergent , a limiting process is required to properly define ( [ evv ] ) .. ]",
    "in this section , we examine the behavior of the two - dimensional massless scalar field under ssd , as a step towards the application of ssd to string theory . for this purpose ,",
    "we need to espouse the lagrangian formalism . in the following exposition",
    ", we adopt the notation of @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the two - dimensional free bosonic field @xmath91 is @xmath92 where the non - dimensional normalization of the lagrangian @xmath93 is left undetermined , for convenient comparison with different conventions .",

    "we consider the bosonic field @xmath95 on a cylinder of circumference @xmath29 so that @xmath96",
    ". then , the field is expressed by the following fourier expansion : @xmath97 in terms of the fourier components @xmath98 , the lagrangian is expressed as @xmath99 then the momentum conjugate to @xmath100 is @xmath101 the hamiltonian is obtained as @xmath102 note that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "introducing @xmath105 we obtain the following commutation relations from the canonical commutation relation @xmath106=i\\delta_{nm}$ ] : @xmath107=n\\delta_{n+m}\\ , \\qquad [ \\bar{a}_n , \\bar{a}_m]=n\\delta_{n+m}\\ , \\qquad [ a_n , \\bar{a}_m]=0.\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath108 , the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath109 note that @xmath110    when @xmath111 s and @xmath112 s are treated as operators , they can form the following virasoro operators : @xmath113 the hamiltonian and virasoro operators are related as follows : @xmath114 up to a constant , which is irrelevant in the following discussion .",
    "we can consider new terms if the hamiltonian contains @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : ln ] ) and ( [ eq : lbarn ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath117 from which the following relation is easily observed : @xmath118 we now proceed to evaluate the the lagrangian expression corresponding to the deformed hamiltonian @xmath119 .",
    "we may reasonably expect a general form of the corresponding deformed lagrangian , such as @xmath120 postulating the following forms for @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xmath123 we determine whether the deformed lagrangian generates @xmath124 . in ( [ eq : fgpos ] ) , the parameter @xmath125 represents deformation .",
    "the number @xmath126 should be less than unity and may depend on the value of @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath0 is the normalization factor for @xmath127 and may also depend on @xmath125 .",
    "since ( [ eq : fgpos ] ) should revert to the original lagrangian when @xmath128 , we expect that @xmath129 and @xmath130 as @xmath131 .",
    "the deformed lagrangian , denoted @xmath132 as a reminder of the role of @xmath125 , can be expressed in terms of the fourier modes @xmath133 @xmath134 introducing the following notation @xmath135 the kinetic part of the lagrangian can be simply expressed as @xmath136 from ( [ eqn : kinterm ] ) , it follows that the canonical conjugate momentum becomes @xmath137 the last equality follows from the explicit definition of @xmath138 ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "here we claim that @xmath139 in other words , @xmath0 and @xmath126 can be expressed in terms of @xmath125 such that @xmath140 to validiate claims ( [ eq : claimfminus ] ) or ( [ eq : claimpiphi ] ) , we require that @xmath141 is identical to @xmath142 .",
    "this requirement can be met only under the following conditions : @xmath143 it is trivial to see that conditions ( [ eq : nrcond ] ) are satisfied if @xmath144 solving the above quadratic equation and demanding that @xmath129 as @xmath131 , we find that the expressions @xmath145 validate claims ( [ eq : claimfminus ] ) and ( [ eq : claimpiphi ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath126 and @xmath0 satisfy ( [ eq : rnsol ] ) and that @xmath138 is accordingly determined from ( [ eq : fdef ] ) in the following .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath132 , which we denote @xmath146 , is now calculated as @xmath147,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which evaluates to @xmath148 using ( [ eq : l1lm1 ] ) , ( [ eq : h0p ] ) , and ( [ eq : h0l0 ] ) . ) was also discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "thus , @xmath149 varies from the original free hamiltonian to a sine - square deformed hamiltonian up to the overall factor @xmath11 as @xmath125 is varied from @xmath10 to @xmath150 .",
    "when @xmath151 in ( [ eq : rnsol ] ) , @xmath152 and ( [ eq : fgpos ] ) becomes @xmath153 however , from ( [ eq : rnsol ] ) , we note that @xmath0 in ( [ eq : fgposa1 ] ) diverges as @xmath125 tends to unity .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath121 , the part of the lagrangian which is supposedly correspond to @xmath154 component of the worldsheet metric , severely diverges under the ssd , at least in the gauge applied here . while one may expect a divergence upon such a singular event like the change of the boundary condition , here we have not exhausted all the options to remedy the divergence .",
    "nonetheless , the appearance of such divergence impedes attempts at further analysis . a possible approach may be to maintain @xmath125 away from unity . in this approach",
    ", @xmath125 may serve as a regularization parameter .",
    "these analyses , as well as the quantization of the total system and the associated question of the gauge fixing , are left for future study .",
    "to better understand the relationships between open and closed strings , we investigated the ssd of string theory .",
    "we encountered strong divergence in the worldsheet metric of the sine - square deformed model .",
    "this divergence in the lagrangian could be partly caused by the continuous treatment of the worldsheet . therefore one may try to discretize the worldsheet itself @xcitebesides the approach proposed in the previous section .",
    "one such attempt could be achieved by the use of matrix models .",
    "another might be an introduction of non - commutativity on the worldsheet .",
    "non - commutative worldsheet had been considered in @xcite and it had lead the deformed virasoro algebra @xcite . the point raised in the footnote in subsection [ footnote : uqsl2 ] might also be relevant to this respect .",
    "of course , the ultimate question should be , what is the nature of ssd theory . though we started from conformal field theory , after applying the ssd",
    ", there is no guarantee that conformal symmetry is still preserved even partially . while the retention of conformal symmetry ( at least partially ) is certainly desirable for ssd theory to be useful in the study of string theory , the analysis presented here is inconclusive on the matter .",
    "one suggestive finding presented here , though , is the degenerate vacua . if there are more degenerate states we have not yet found , it is imaginable that there are also many other states whose energy eigenvalues are close to the vacuum energy .",
    "then , it might imply that the system possesses a continuous spectrum .",
    "this point should be pursued further in future studies .",
    "we also emphasize that the coupling constant of our analyzed system was spatially modulated . in statistical models ,",
    "such modulations have not played a significant role .",
    "however , this is exactly what we would do when one introduces gravity to the model . in the context of string theory ,",
    "this rather seems to be a natural option .",
    "in fact , @xcite considered inhomogeneous xxx model , the particular case of xxz model .",
    "the inhomogeneity there differs from our analysis but it may have relevance in a wider sense .",
    "it is possible that a variety of spatial modulations introduced to statistical models ( especially solvable ones ) may reveal a rich structure and become essential in future studies of string theory .",
