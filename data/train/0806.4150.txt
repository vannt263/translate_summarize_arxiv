    "in the present paper , we continue our discussion of the dynamics of extragalactic jets in cluster environments within the framework of the `` magnetic tower '' model @xcite , which we have analyzed in a series of papers .",

    "an underlying large - scale ( coronal ) poloidal field for producing the magnetically driven jets is almost universally assumed in many theoretical / numerical models .",
    "however , the origin and existence of such a galactic magnetic field are still poorly understood .",
    "in contrast with the large - scale field models , lynden - bell @xcite examined the expansion of the local force - free magnetic loops anchored to the star and the accretion disk by using the semi - analytic approach .",
    "twisted magnetic fluxes due to the disk rotation make the magnetic loops unstable and splay out at a semi - angle 60   from the rotational axis of the disk .",
    "global magnetostatic solutions of magnetic towers with external thermal pressure were also computed by @xcite using the grad - shafranov equation in axisymmetry ( see also , * ? ? ?",

    "full mhd numerical simulations of magnetic towers have been performed in two - dimension ( axisymmetric ) @xcite and three - dimension @xcite .",
    "magnetic towers are also observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the first in our series , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , described the basic assumptions and approaches in the numerical modeling of magnetic tower jets .",
    "the evolution of the tower jets in a constant density / pressure background was examined there .",
    "the second in our series , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) investigated the global structure of magnetic tower jets in a gravitationally - stratified atmosphere , in terms of the mhd wave structure , radial force equilibrium , and collimation .",
    "a large current flowing parallel to the jet bulk flow plays an essential role in the determining the lobe radius , as does the background pressure profile .",
    "the third in our series , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) investigated the stability properties of magnetic tower jets on cluster scales .",
    "current - driven instabilities are responsible for the non - axisymmetric structures ; the external `` kink '' ( @xmath3 ) mode grows outside @xmath0 , while the internal `` double helix '' ( @xmath4 ) mode grows predominantly inside @xmath1 .",
    "this is the forth in our series of papers to examine the nonlinear magnetic tower jets .",
    "here we examine our model s applicability to an individual source , hercules ( herc ) a ( 3c 348 ) , by performing three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "herc a is one of the most powerful double - lobed radio sources in the sky .",
    "its total energy content is approximately @xmath5 erg and it is identified with the central compact diffuse ( cd ) galaxy of a cluster @xcite at a low redshift of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xcite is thought to be due to bremsstrahlung of the very high temperature intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "herc a has a peculiar radio structure ; the morphology looks like a classical double - lobed fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr ii ) radio source @xcite , but it has no compact hotspots , instead showing an unusual jet - dominated morphology as in an fanaroff - riley type i ( fr i ) radio source , which was first revealed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the two jets in herc a are quite different in appearance .",
    "the eastern jet appears to have continuous twisting flows , while the western jet leads to a unique sequence of `` rings '' .",
    "the jets in herc a are well - collimated initially but they flare suddenly at a certain distance from the nucleus .",
    "an explanation for the presence of such different structures in the same source is still unresolved in the literature .",
    "herc a is not a typical fr i source , either ; its jets are well - collimated and has knot components .",
    "therefore , herc a might be classified an intermediate case : fr i / ii .",
    "various models have been proposed for explaining the formation of the jets and rings in herc a , including both kinematic @xcite and dynamic @xcite points of view . by performing axisymmetric , two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", @xcite proposed a model in which an _ over_-dense and _ over_-pressured jet undergoes a sudden expansion when it becomes highly over - pressured compared to the background gas at a certain distance from the core .",
    "this causes a subsequent conical expansion , giving rise to the `` ice cream cone '' shape of the lobe .",
    "however , at present , there is nothing in the x - ray observations to suggest that the jet becomes thermally over - pressured as required in this model . in @xcite , the formation of ring structure in the western jet is interpreted as the result of ribbon - like , annular shocks propagating through the jet cocoon .",
    "also , these authors conclude that the absence of hot spots in herc a results from the dynamics of turbulent and entraining backflows in the radio lobe .",
    "recently , @xcite have revealed detailed structures of total intensity , spectral index , polarization , and projected magnetic field in herc a by using multifrequency vla imaging .",
    "the jet disruption in the eastern lobe is clearly visible , implying flow instabilities . the projected magnetic field ,",
    "after correcting for faraday rotation , closely follows the edges of the lobes , the jets , and the rings ; the two lobes have generally similar field patterns .",
    "this observational picture may disagree with the turbulent structure inside the lobes suggested by @xcite .",
    "magnetic field distributions associated with the extragalactic jets and their comparisons with the observations have been examined by using stokes parameters , faraday rotation measure ( rm ) , and the projected magnetic field ( @xmath2-vector ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in general , helical magnetic fields produce asymmetric transverse brightness and polarization profiles ; they are symmetrical only if the field is purely toroidal or the jet is at 90@xmath9 to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that , to the first approximation , the field configuration in fr i jet over 10 kpc scales is a mixture of toroidal and longitudinal components .",
    "@xcite s _ rosat _ x - ray observations of the intracluster gas in the herc a cluster have revealed extended x - ray emission coming from a compact source at the center of cluster , out to a radius of 2.2 mpc .",
    "the azimuthally - averaged x - ray surface brightness profile is well fitted by a modified king ( @xmath10 ) model @xcite , with core radius @xmath11 kpc and @xmath12 .",
    "their x - ray analysis supports the conclusion that the inner jets are confined thermally by the cluster core gas : thermal pressure in the cluster core is almost 10 times larger than the equipartition pressure in the eastern jet with the standard assumptions ( including no protons ) .",
    "the radio lobes are largely positioned _ beyond _ the x - ray core radius , allowing for projection , so they are expanding essentially into a power - law atmosphere with density falling as @xmath13 , quite close to the @xmath14 profile needed to give the lobes a self - similar structure @xcite .",
    "these observational evidence motivate us to apply our dynamical magnetic tower jet model to herc a. to our knowledge , no mhd model has been applied to herc a before though there are several hydrodynamic models as we have already referred .",
    "radio observations suggest that the magnetic fields need to be taken into account to discuss about jet / lobe dynamics in herc a. we believe that a key clue to understanding the transition between the jet and the lobe may be whether or not the inner jets become over - pressured during their propagation in the x - ray thermal cluster gas .",
    "however , the jet internal pressure may be magnetically , rather than thermally , dominated .",
    "this is in contrast to previous models @xcite .",
    "of particular interest here are the jet / lobe transition , wiggling , and the magnetic field distribution associated with the eastern jet of herc a , which are not yet fully discussed among the past hydrodynamic models of herc a. we do not discuss the formation of rings in the western jet in this paper .",

    "we use the outflow boundary conditions at all outer boundaries . note that for most of the simulation duration , the waves and magnetic fields stay within the simulation box , and all magnetic fields are self - sustained by their internal currents .      based on our simulations ,",
    "we make synthetic observation images to compare with the real observations of herc a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gl03 ) .",
    "the synthetic radio telescope observations presented here were produced using a modified form of the synthetic observation technique first described in @xcite .",
    "here we provide an overview of the key points relevant to the present investigation ; a complete description of the technique is provided in @xcite .",
    "our method utilizes the vector magnetic field structures evolved self - consistently within these mhd calculations and a relativistic - electron momentum distribution , @xmath62 , chosen by fiat during postprocessing . the function @xmath62 is defined over eight logarithmically - spaced momentum bins .",
    "each bin has an associated slope value , @xmath63 , and within each bin the distribution is a power law ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "slope values may vary between bins , however , making it possible to specify non - power law distributions , such as would be appropriate for cases where radiative aging is significant .",
    "the specified distribution functions are free to vary from location to location within the simulated flows , as is expected to be the case in real radio galaxies .",
    "we note that although these distributions are not derived self - consistently within the computed flows , as has been done in previous works @xcite , imposing it as a postprocessing step does provide a measure of flexibility in our investigations .    in this paper",
    "we choose the sign convention such that @xmath65 , and the flux density @xmath66 .",
    "for the present investigations , which do not incorporate the effects of radiative aging and reacceleration , we applied a spatially - uniform momentum slope value @xmath67 throughout the simulated source .",
    "this corresponds to a synchrotron spectral index @xmath68 , which is consistent with the observed range of spectral indices within individual radio galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite mapped the spectral index distribution in herc a between 1.3 and 4.8 ghz , finding @xmath69 , with the flattest values within the western jet and the steepest values along the lobe edges .",
    "they also found @xmath70 in portions of the eastern jet .",
    "our choice , @xmath71 , is also consistent with typical hotspot spectral index values @xmath72 in the sample of 3cr sources studied by @xcite .    the local number density of energetic electrons varied with the local magnetic energy density ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) .",
    "this approach represents a partitioning relationship between the field and particle energies , such as is posited by minimum - energy arguments @xcite .",
    "however , the overall scaling was chosen such that the energy density of relativistic electrons was far less than the magnetic energy density ( i.e. , we assume our simulated object is out of equipartition , which is consistent with the lack of dynamical feedback from the electrons in these calculations ) .    given information about the local magnetic field and the local distribution of energetic electrons , we compute a synchrotron emissivity @xmath74 in every zone of the computational grid . as given by @xcite ,",
    "the emissivity is @xmath75 the spectral index @xmath76 is related to the local electron momentum index @xmath63 via @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 projects the local field onto the sky , and @xmath80 is an order - unity dimensionless constant , defined in @xcite . for a selected observing frequency , @xmath81 , the distribution , @xmath82 , and the index , @xmath63 , are determined for each point on the numerical grid by establishing the relevant electron momentum from the relation @xmath83^{(1/2)}$ ] , with @xmath84 in units @xmath85 .",
    "once the synchrotron emissivity is known for every numerical zone , we compute surface brightness maps for optically - thin emission via line - of - sight integrations .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the stokes @xmath86 and @xmath87 parameters for the synchrotron emission , as well as the correction for faraday rotation through the source , making detailed polarimetric studies possible .",
    "we write the resultant data in fits format , and analyze it using conventional observational packages ( miriad and karma @xcite ) .",
    "our magnetic tower model has been applied to the herc a. in particular , our goal is to reproduce large scale structures in the jets : the jet / lobe transition , the non - axisymmetric deformation , and the projected magnetic field distribution associated with the jets and lobes , as observed in gl03 .    figure [ fig : f1 ] shows a snapshot of the gas pressure @xmath43 in the ( @xmath88 ) cross section at @xmath89 ( 192 myr ) . as we have examined in papers ii and iii , the global structure of the magnetic tower consists of a well - collimated `` body '' and radially extended `` lobes '' in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere .",
    "a transition from the narrow jet to the fat lobe can occur at the cluster core radius .",
    "this interesting property can be confirmed in resent observations ( gl03 , gl04 ) .",
    "several key features in these magnetic tower jets ( the mhd wave structures , the heating process at the tower front , the cylindrical radial force equilibrium at the tower edge , and the dynamic collimation process ) are similar to the results of paper ii ( see also fig . 1 of paper ii for details of time evolution ) .",
    "the helically - twisted magnetic tower has a closed current system that includes a pair of current circuits .",
    "each circuit contains a forward electric current path ( the jet flow itself , with its toroidal magnetic field , toward the lobe ) and a return current ( along some path back to the agn core ) .",
    "the global picture of a current - carrying jet with a closed current system linking the magnetosphere of the central engine and the hot spots was introduced by @xcite and applied to agn double radio sources . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , the high - pressure material of the ambient gas seems to follow the edge of the jet near the bottom of each lobe .",
    "however , this is not the case , but the local pressure enhancement occurs inside the lobes . in the jet and lobe system ,",
    "the axial currents drive the current - driven instabilities ; it eventually produces magnetic reconnection process even in our ideal mhd assumption ( the magnetic field will dissipate numerically ) . as a result ,",
    "some local heating may occur , but it never affects the dynamics of jet propagation dramatically .    for a full 3-d visualization of the magnetic lines of force , the reader is referred to paper iii .",
    "the basic behavior of the helically - twisted magnetic field in the present paper appears similar to that in paper iii .",
    "the magnetic tower jet has a well - ordered helical field configuration , with a tightly - wound central helix going up along the central axis and a loosely -wound helix coming back at the outer edge of the magnetic tower .",
    "the outer edge of the magnetic tower may be identified as a tangential discontinuity without the normal field component .",
    "the interior of tower ( lobe ) is separated from the non - magnetized external gas via this discontinuity . at the tower edge ,",
    "the outward - directed magnetic pressure gradient force is roughly balanced with the inwardly - directed thermal pressure gradient force . on the other hand , at the core part of jet body , a quasi - force free equilibrium is achieved . in the context of magnetically - controlled fusion systems , the helical field in the magnetic tower",
    "can be regarded as the reversed field pinch ( rfp ) profile .",
    "the jet axial current and the ambient gas pressure can together determine the radius of the magnetically - dominated lobes ( paper ii ) .",
    "that is , the internal gas pressure plays a minor role in the lobes ( even if the thermal pressure is greater than the non - thermal pressure @xcite as is typically seen in fr i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the alfvn speed becomes large ( about three times the local sound speed ) , while the plasma @xmath90 becomes small ( @xmath91 ) inside the density cavities due to the expansion of magnetic fluxes .",
    "as we have already discussed in paper ii , it is remarkably noted that the expanding tower launches a preceding hydrodynamic shock in the icm , which may be associated with agn - driven shocks seen in recent x - ray observations @xcite .",

    "the sound speed jumps by 27 % [ the temperature @xmath97 increases by 61 % ] in the postshocked region due to the shock compression .",
    "the magnetic tower front , which is identified as the lobe front , is located at @xmath98 .",
    "there is another mhd wave front at @xmath99 where an increase in @xmath100 ( density / pressure also ) is accompanied by a increase in magnetic pressure ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) , indicating the reverse mhd slow mode . in later time , this can steepen into a mhd slow shock that cause a compression ( heating ) at the head of magnetic tower as seen in fig .",

    "figure [ fig : f3 ] displays the positions of the shock and lobe fronts as a function of time along the @xmath48-axis ( propagating towards the positive direction ) . the shock front has a constant propagation speed @xmath101 ( @xmath102 cm s@xmath8 ) that implies a mach number @xmath103 . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetically - dominated lobe front expands subsonically .",

    "the current - carrying magnetic tower jet , which possesses a highly - wound helical field , is subject to the current - driven instability ( cdi ) .",
    "although the destabilization criteria will be modified by the ambient gas and the rfp configuration of the tower , we find that the propagating magnetic tower jets can develop the non - axisymmetric cdi modes .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , both the internal elliptical ( @xmath4 ) mode like the `` double helix '' and the external kink ( @xmath3 ) mode grow to produce the wiggles at different locations ( see also paper iii for details ) .",

    "when the synthetic 5 ghz synchrotron map is scaled to an angular size comparable to that of herc a , the brightest pixel ( beam ) in the synthetic 5 ghz surface brightness map is 875 mjy / beam .",
    "however , away from the small , bright region near the core , the jets generally exhibit flux densities on the order of 30 - 70 mjy / beam , the central sheath exhibits flux densities in the range 20 - 30 mjy / beam , and the darkest parts of the lobes exhibit @xmath110 1.0 mjy / beam .",
    "our simulated source exhibits a fractional linear polarization , @xmath111 , at 5 ghz ranging from a few percent in the most magnetically tangled portions of the lobes to @xmath112 on the lobe edges .",

    "fractional polarization values exceed 60% ( roughly twice that reported in gl03 ) in small , isolated pockets in the sheath around the central jet and near the central core , which may indicate insufficient computational resolution near the core for properly capturing cellular depolarization . in regions outside the magnetized lobes , where the ambient medium in our calculational domain has been mildly perturbed by expansion of the magnetic tower , the degree of polarization approaches 72% .",

    "fig : f6 ] is qualitatively consistent with @xmath123 and is comparable with the physical scale seen in radio observations @xcite . based on this numerical result , we estimate that one simulated lobe of herc - a may contain a total energy @xmath143 ergs , out of which @xmath144 ergs are in magnetic energy , @xmath145 ergs are in kinetic energy , and @xmath146 ergs are in thermal energy , respectively . in order to explain the lobe radius by this magnetically dominated lobe system , an axial current @xmath147 a , which is flowing along the jet central axis , is needed .",
    "by performing 3d mhd simulations , we have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic tower jets in a galaxy cluster environment . in this fourth paper of the series",
    ", we have applied our numerical modeling of the magnetic tower to a specific source , hercules a.    to our knowledge , this is the first trial of discussing hercules a jet by using a magnetohydrodynamic model . projected magnetic field distributions associated with the jets and lobes of hercules a have been revealed in recent radio observation and therefore , the dynamics including magnetic fields plays a role in understanding this source . in the present paper , we have investigated the jet - driven shock , jet / lobe transition , wiggling , and projected magnetic field distribution of hercules a and , in general , these feasutres can be explained by our magnetic tower model .      1",
    ".   a transition from the narrow jet to the fat lobe can occur at the cluster core radius .",
    "this interesting feature can also be confirmed in recent observations @xcite . in our models",
    ", the tightly collimated helical field configuration of a magnetic tower jet expands abruptly beyond the core radius due to the decreasing external gas pressure .",
    "thus , the pressure profile of the surrounding icm plays an important role in determining the morphology of a magnetic tower jet .",
    "2 .   the expanding magnetic tower jet produces the preceding hydrodynamic shock wave in the ambient icm .",
    "this can be interpreted as agn - driven shock in x - ray observation and the derived shock mach number is identical to @xcite s observation result .",
    "the magnetic tower lobes expand subsonically and thus no hot spots are produced at the end parts of lobes .",
    "this may be a general understanding of fr i or low power fr ii radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the size of the magnetic tower lobe can be accurately estimated from the jet axial current and the external gas pressure at the lobe edge .",
    "the estimated lobe size derived by our numerical simulation is qualitatively comparable with the physical scale seen in @xcite . in our model , if the background gas has a steep slope ( @xmath10 ) in the king profile , the magnetic jet can potentially lead to a huge magnetic tower lobe .",
    "magnetic tower jets , which have a reversed magnetic pinch profile , are subject to current - driven instabilities . specifically , the apparent distortions by the non - axisymmetric kink mode are visible at the jet body inside the lobe rather than the central core . by expanding the lobe",
    "the edge of axial currents could be free against the exciting external kink mode ; this situation may be suppressed inside the cluster core radius .",
    "the synthetic polarimetry of our magnetic - tower jets is consistent with the gross polarization features observed in the jets of hercules a. the magnetic tower model produces projected @xmath2-vector distributions that are similar to those observed in the global extragalactic jet - lobe system , especially along the jets and the lobe edges . 6 .",
    "magnetic tower jets may produce a self - consistent picture of the field configuration discussed in several non - dynamical model of fr i jets .",
    "it consists of toroidally dominated spine inside the lobe and poloidally dominated sheath at the lobe edge ( a closed poloidal magnetic flux with a toroidal magnetic component , rather than one side directed helical configuration ) .",
