    "the gravitational interaction of a gaseous or particulate disc with an orbiting companion is of general interest in astrophysics .",
    "important examples include protoplanetary systems involving one or more planets orbiting within a gaseous disc , accretion discs in close binary stars , and systems of planetary rings and moons .    as in the planetary theory of classical celestial mechanics , the disc and companion experience deviations from perfect keplerian motion around the central mass as a result of their mutual gravitational perturbations . sufficiently close to the companion s orbit , the behaviour of the disc can be complicated and highly nonlinear , leading in many cases to an exclusion of the disc from the coorbital region .",
    "the extent of such a gap depends on the ratio of the mass of the companion to that of the central object , and on the properties of the disc .",
    "away from this region , the interaction can be analysed by perturbation methods and has two principal forms .",
    "_ secular interactions _ ( of first order in the perturbation ) arise from the mass distribution of the companion averaged around its orbit .",
    "these contribute to the precessional behaviour of the system and allow slow , reversible exchanges of eccentricity and inclination between the companion and the disc .",
    "such behaviour is analogous to the laplace  lagrange secular theory of planetary systems in which , for example , jupiter and saturn undergo large - amplitude oscillatory exchanges of eccentricity and inclination over tens of thousands of years ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "_ mean - motion resonances _ depend specifically on the periodic nature of the companion s orbit .",
    "the fluctuating forces induced by the companion generally give rise to rapid oscillations of small amplitude in the disc that are of little consequence .",
    "however , where a commensurability occurs between the orbital periods of the companion and a particle in the disc , a strong localized interaction occurs . through the intervention of collective effects and dissipation in the disc , a different kind of secular behaviour is induced at second order in the perturbation .",
    "this leads to irreversible changes in semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination of the disc and companion , rather than just precessional behaviour .",
    "mean - motion resonances in satellite  disc interactions were studied in detail in an influential series of papers by goldreich & tremaine . early in this series @xcite",
    "the authors considered a two - dimensional problem in which a circular disc is perturbed by a companion with a slightly eccentric orbit . to calculate the linear response of the disc",
    ", they decomposed the perturbing potential by fourier analysis into a series of rigidly rotating components with various amplitudes , azimuthal wavenumbers and angular pattern speeds . in a system with keplerian orbits",
    ", the angular pattern speeds that occur are rational multiples @xmath0 of the mean motion of the companion , the amplitude scaling with the @xmath1th power of the eccentricity .",
    "the linearized equations governing the response of the disc at a given azimuthal wavenumber and angular pattern speed allow for the propagation of free waves in certain intervals of radius .",
    "three important radii are the corotation radius , where the wave frequency as measured in a frame rotating locally with the disc vanishes , and the two lindblad radii , where the same quantity equals ( plus or minus ) the epicyclic frequency . in the simplest case of a two - dimensional non - self - gravitating disc , only one wave mode is permitted .",
    "this ` density wave ' combines inertial ( epicyclic ) and acoustic behaviour and can propagate only where the wave frequency seen by the disc exceeds the epicyclic frequency in magnitude .",
    "it therefore propagates interior to the inner lindblad radius and exterior to the outer lindblad radius , but is evanescent between the lindblad radii where the corotation radius lies .",
    "the forcing of disturbances by a perturbing potential component is effectively localized to the neighbourhoods of the corotation and lindblad radii . beyond the lindblad radii ,",
    "the forcing is ineffective because of the very limited overlap between the potential and the free waves , which oscillate rapidly in radius . despite the evanescent nature of the free waves near the corotation radius",
    ", it plays an important role as a singularity of the linearized equations .",
    "the forcing can then be said to occur at corotation and lindblad _ resonances _ , which can be identified with the mean - motion resonances of celestial mechanics .",
    "the reason for this is that , in a keplerian system where the epicyclic frequency equals the orbital frequency , any radius where the orbital frequency is commensurate with the mean motion of the companion serves , in principle , as both corotation and lindblad resonances for some potential components .    at a _ corotation resonance _",
    "the linearized response of the disc at first order in the perturbation is singular but can be resolved by including a viscosity . at second order in the perturbation ,",
    "the companion exerts a secular torque on the disc as it generates a localized , non - wavelike disturbance that transfers angular momentum steadily to the disc through viscous stresses .    at a _",
    "lindblad resonance _ the localized response is regularized by collective effects such as pressure , self - gravity or viscosity , and is generally in the form of an attenuated wave propagating away from the resonance . at second order in the perturbation , and provided that the wave is dissipated somehow within the disc , the companion again exerts a secular torque in launching the disturbance ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in a three - dimensional disc , not considered by @xcite , a _",
    "vertical resonance _ is similar to a lindblad resonance but involves forcing and motion perpendicular to the plane of the disc , so that a bending wave is excited rather than a density wave .",
    "convenient formulae are available for the corotation and lindblad torques , which have an important role in determining the orbital evolution of the companion and the surface density distribution of the disc .",
    "the subsequent literature has made extensive use of these expressions , as well as providing some modifications to the torque formulae @xcite .",
    "together , these results provide the basis of our understanding of planet  disc and other satellite  disc interactions .",
    "it is perhaps not widely appreciated that the approach described above is inadequate for general satellite  disc interactions .",
    "a knowledge of the resonant torque ( by which is meant the component of the torque perpendicular to the disc ) determines one component of the rates of change of the orbital angular momentum vectors of the disc and companion and also , by virtue of jacobi s theorem , the rate of change of orbital energy of the companion ; however , this information does not generally suffice to determine the secular rates of change of the relevant orbital elements of the disc and companion .",
    "furthermore , the method does not apply to the general case in which the disc is eccentric , because the forced wave equations in an eccentric disc have not been analysed .",
    "later in their series of papers , @xcite and @xcite employed methods of celestial mechanics to treat cases in which either the companion or the disc has an eccentric and/or inclined orbit . using `",
    "simple artifices ' they derived formulae for the rates of change of the canonical action variables associated with mean - motion resonances , in terms of the classical disturbing function , while avoiding an explicit discussion of collective effects . in principle , these expressions are considerably more powerful and general than the earlier torque formulae , yet they appear not to have been used in the subsequent literature .",
    "we have tried to make use of them in connection with eccentric planet ",
    "disc interactions and similar problems but found that they generally give results that are not of the desired form .",
    "one aspect of their method is that it isolates , in the traditional way , terms of different angular arguments in the disturbing function .",
    "an implicit averaging is therefore involved over the mutual apsidal and nodal precession of the disc and companion . at least in some contexts , this procedure is inappropriate because the mutual precession may occur on a timescale comparable to that of the secular evolution induced by mean - motion resonances , or indeed may not occur at all if the disc and companion are engaged in a secular normal mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the formulae therefore describe the rates of change of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 averaged over the timescales of mutual precession , while what are generally desired are the rates of change of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 averaged only over the relative mean motion .",
    ", @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the semimajor axis , eccentricity , inclination , longitude of pericentre and longitude of ascending node , while @xmath7 is the mean longitude .",
    "the secular contribution to the evolution of @xmath7 is of less interest here . ]",
    "a second aspect is the way that dissipation is introduced into the analysis , which is essential to capture the irreversible nature of the effects of mean - motion resonances .",
    "this is done either by including ad hoc damping terms @xcite or is avoided altogether by using landau s prescription in which the disturbing function is given a slow exponential growth @xcite .",
    "although mathematically convenient , these approaches can give misleading results .",
    "the effects of mean - motion resonances depend on the fact that the disc conserves angular momentum while it dissipates energy , and the damping terms added to the equations ought to respect these properties .",
    "the landau approach is problematic because the first - order oscillatory disturbances in the disc are permitted to grow exponentially rather than being steadily dissipated , making it difficult to calculate the second - order secular changes correctly .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to revisit the analysis of mean - motion resonances in satellite  disc interactions and to derive useful and general formulae for the associated evolution of orbital elements of the disc and companion .",
    "we employ methods of celestial mechanics and treat the collective effects of the disc in an approximate way that is adequate for our present purposes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : restricted ] we consider the restricted problem in which the companion has a prescribed orbit .",

    "the disc is perturbed by an orbiting companion of mass @xmath9 . in the _ restricted problem",
    "_ the perturber has a prescribed periodic orbit that is unaffected by the disc .",
    "this approximation is usually applicable , for example , to accretion discs in binary stars . in this case",
    "the influence of the companion on a test particle in the disc can be described through a disturbing function that is a specified function of the position of the particle and is also a periodic function of time .    in order to treat the dynamical equations in the most efficient way",

    ". therefore application of landau s prescription in this case gives a misleading result for the second - order behaviour of the disc .",
    "we now attempt to give a justification for the procedure described above .",
    "the detailed behaviour of the disc near a resonance depends , in principle , on a number of factors : the relative importance of various collective effects ( such as pressure , self - gravity or viscosity ) , the level of nonlinearity , the vertical structure of a three - dimensional disc , etc .",

    "terms in the disturbing function corresponding to the appropriate commensurability produce an oscillation of the orbital elements of the disc and companion at first order in the perturbation . at second order ,",
    "a secular effect is obtained in the form of a precessional dynamics that diverges as the resonance is approached . when the divergence is resolved by taking into account the ( dissipative ) collective effects of the disc , a finite precession rate is obtained , together with an irreversible evolution , such as a growth or decay of eccentricity or inclination .",
    "our work differs from earlier methods in which the perturbing potential is decomposed into rigidly rotating components and the eccentricity evolution is deduced indirectly from resonant torques @xcite .",
    "such methods do not apply to general satellite  disc interactions in which both the disc and companion have eccentric and/or inclined orbits . where appropriate , however , we obtain full agreement with this earlier work . by using the classical disturbing function ,",
    "we benefit from the ready availability of expansions to high degrees in eccentricity and inclination .    after considerable thought , we recommend the use of complex canonical poincar variables , as defined in section  [ s : complex ] , to describe the eccentricity and inclination dynamics .",
    "these allow the most compact expression of the dynamical equations and the disturbing function .",
    "they are also directly related to the angular momentum deficit ( amd ) , which is a quantity of fundamental importance , being a positive - definite measure of the departure of the system from circularity and coplanarity that is conserved in first - order secular interactions . by concentrating on the evolution of the system s amd we can separate the effects that lead to irreversible growth or decay of eccentricity and inclination from those that are merely precessional in character . moreover , the use of complex variables leads , in the case of small eccentricities and inclinations , to linear evolutionary equations that would be extremely cumbersome in any other representation .",
    "this work does not address certain refinements that are necessary for a more complete description of resonant interactions .",
    "the important omitted effects are nonlinearity ( in particular the saturation of corotation resonances ) , torque cutoff effects , resonant shifts and vertical averaging .",
    "it is likely that all of these could be addressed within the present framework .",
    "the equations derived here do not stand alone but should be combined , in future work , with the complex one - dimensional partial differential equations describing the secular evolution of eccentricity and inclination in the disc . in simple cases such",
    "a programme has already been carried out @xcite .",
    "for small eccentricity and inclination the outcome is a set of secular normal modes , being a continuum analogue of the laplace  lagrange secular theory , which describe rigidly precessing configurations of disc(s ) and companion(s ) .",
    "the contribution of mean - motion resonances allows these modes to grow ( or decay ) , and any growth must be offset against the viscous damping of the mode within the disc .",
    "coupled eccentric modes have also been discussed by @xcite .",
    "previous discussions of eccentricity growth in protoplanetary systems , for example , have presented an interesting but incomplete picture .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite discuss the close competition between eccentric lindblad resonances and eccentric corotation resonances .",
    "this is equivalent to comparing equations  ( [ elr ] ) and  ( [ ecr ] ) with the complex eccentricity @xmath114 of the disc set to zero ( and @xmath314 .",
    "since the disc becomes eccentric through secular ( and possibly resonant ) interactions , the relative weighting of all these resonances is adjusted in a way that depends on the eccentricity distribution within the disc . a self - consistent solution of the coupled secular dynamics , as carried out by @xcite in the case of inclination , is therefore required to address the issue .",
    "it remains to be seen whether protoplanetary systems support growing eccentric modes in the presence of viscous damping ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "another application of this work is to close binary stars , where accretion discs can sometimes become eccentric through the action of the 3:1 resonance .",
    "this work suggests various elaborations of the description by @xcite .",
    "in addition to eccentricity growth , the 3:1 resonance provides an second - order precession that may affect the shape of the eccentric mode and alter the global precession rate of the disc .",
    "the growth rate is weakened when the eccentricity is no longer small , leading to a possible saturation mechanism for the superhump instability .",
    "finally , higher - order resonances such as @xmath315 provide eccentricity growth of the form @xmath316 which , although not leading to a linear instability , might conceivably support a global eccentric mode in binary stars of larger mass ratio , where the disc is too small to contain the 3:1 resonance .",
