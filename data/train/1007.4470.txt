    "random polymers are commonly used in statistical mechanics to model a variety of interesting physical phenomena .",
    "a rich class of models with a non trivial behavior is obtained by considering a simple random walk path interacting with a defect line in the thermodynamic limit when the length of the path tends to infinity .",
    "the equilibrium of these so - called polymer pinning models has been studied in depth in the mathematical literature , and the associated localization / delocalization phase transition is , nowadays , a well understood phenomenon , even in the presence of non homogeneous interactions ; see @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "markovian stochastic dynamics of random pinned polymers , on the other hand , have received much less attention from a mathematical point of view . besides their importance in bio - physical applications ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , the stochastic evolution of polymer models poses new challenging probabilistic problems from many points of view and the connection between the equilibrium and dynamical properties of the model is still largely unexplored . in particular , we feel that the problem of how the polymer relaxes to the stationary distribution ( time scales , overcoming of energy barriers , metastability , patterns leading to equilibrium ) still lacks a satisfactory solution even in the simplest homogeneous models ; see @xcite for some initial results in this direction .",
    "in this paper we consider the dynamics of a homogeneous polymer model interacting with a repulsive defect line with two main motivations in mind :    a.   the repulsive regime is characterized by a relaxation to equilibrium occurring on a time scale certainly much larger @xcite than the usual diffusive one which is typical of the e.g. neutral case @xcite .",
    "the new scale is clearly the result of a complicate competition in the polymer evolution between diffusive behavior and jumps against energy barriers .",
    "b.   the whole relaxation mechanism should show certain typical features of metastable evolution but in a very _ a - typical _ context in which the relevant relaxation time scales are only polynomial in the size @xmath1 of the system ( the energy barriers are only logarithmic in @xmath1 ) , with little separation between the mixing time inside one phase and the global mixing time .",
    "a signature of this fact can be found in the anomalous growth with @xmath1 of the global mixing time , a growth which is much more rapid than the naive guess based on the usual rule @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the so called activation energy . in order to appreciate the novelty of such a situation it is useful to compare it to another well known case , namely the glauber dynamics for the low temperature ising model in a square box with free boundary @xcite , for which a very precise analysis of the metastable behavior was possible exactly because of a sharp separation , at an exponential level , between the two time scales .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the set of all lattice paths ( polymers ) starting at @xmath7 and ending at @xmath7 after @xmath8 steps , @xmath9 : @xmath10 the stochastic dynamics is defined by the natural spin - flip continuous time markov chain with state space @xmath11 .",
    "namely , sites @xmath12 are equipped with independent rate @xmath13 poisson clocks . when site @xmath14 rings , the height @xmath15 of the polymer at @xmath14 is updated according to the rules : if @xmath16 then do nothing ; if @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , then set @xmath19 with equal probabilities ; if @xmath20 , then set @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 and @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 ; similarly , if @xmath25 , then set @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 and @xmath26 with probability @xmath24 . here",

    "in particular , it is well known that , under the measure @xmath49 , for @xmath28 the path is strongly localized with a non vanishing density of zeros , while for @xmath29 the path is delocalized with @xmath50 height fluctuations and with the number of zeros stochastically dominated by a geometric random variable with @xmath51-dependent parameter .",
    "the dynamical counterpart of this localization / delocalization transition has not been fully understood yet .",
    "some progress in this direction has been reported in @xcite , where various bounds on the spectral gap and mixing time of the markov chain were obtained , together with estimates on the decay of time correlations .",
    "we recall that the spectral gap is the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath52 , and one is often interested in the _ relaxation time _",

    ", we consider the delocalized regime , i.e.  in the repulsive case @xmath29 . the first question we address concerns an upper bound on the relaxation time @xmath69 and the mixing time @xmath62 .",

    "the equilibrium measure @xmath70 is known to be concentrated , as @xmath71 , on configurations in which the density of monomers in the upper ( lower ) half plane is approximately either one or zero .",
    "however a mathematical working definition of a candidate for the plus or minus phase for the polymer is not so obvious and we have been forced to introduce a mesoscopic parameter @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and define @xmath74 by @xmath75 where , for any set @xmath76 of polymer configurations @xmath77 ) .",
    "the presence of the two phases associated to @xmath74 dramatically changes the relaxation scenario , with a bottleneck at the set @xmath78 . as explained in (",
    "* section 6 ) , one may suspect that @xmath79 is the correct asymptotic behavior in the delocalized regime .",
    "let us briefly recall the heuristic reasoning behind this prediction .    the time to reach equilibrium can be roughly thought of as the time needed to switch from , say , @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "a point @xmath14 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 is called a _ crossing _ of the polymer .",
    "note that any zero ( and therefore any crossing ) @xmath14 must belong to the set @xmath84 of points in the segment @xmath85 which have the same parity as @xmath1 .",
    "since there are typically very few zeros at equilibrium , one may consider the extreme case where at most one crossing @xmath86 is allowed at all times . in this case , the time evolution of @xmath86 should be essentially described by a suitable birth and death process or random walk on @xmath84 ; see figure [ fig : bulle ] .     which allows the system to switch from a mostly negative to a mostly positive configuration .",
    ", scaledwidth=99.0% ]    from equilibrium considerations , one knows that this random walk should have reversible invariant measure @xmath87 roughly proportional to @xmath88 and that its relaxation time can be bounded from above and below by constant multiples of @xmath89 ; see lemma [ equo ] and lemma [ 52 ] below for more details . notice that , although the measure @xmath87 gives uniformly ( in @xmath1 ) positive mass to the two _ attractors _ @xmath90 , the drift which pushes the random walk away from the saddle @xmath91 is proportional to the inverse of the distance from the attractors . in particular the naive guess for the mixing time @xmath92 is wrong .",
    "this heuristics is turned into the rigorous bound ( [ 5/2 ] ) by using a suitable test function in the variational principle that characterizes the spectral gap ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we consider the stochastic evolution of a @xmath0-dimensional polymer in the depinned regime . at equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits a double well structure : the polymer lies ( essentially ) either above or below the repulsive line . as a consequence one expects a metastable behavior with rare jumps between the two phases combined with a fast thermalization inside each phase . </S>",
    "<S> however the energy barrier between these two phases is only logarithmic in the system size @xmath1 and therefore the two relevant time scales are only polynomial in @xmath1 with no clear - cut separation between them . </S>",
    "<S> the whole evolution is governed by a subtle competition between the diffusive behavior inside one phase and the jumps across the energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the usual scenario in which the tunneling time coincides with the exponential of the energy barrier breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are : ( i ) a proof that the mixing time of the system lies between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; ( ii ) the identification of two regions associated with the positive and negative phase of the polymer together with the proof of the asymptotic exponentiality of the tunneling time between them with rate equal to a half of the spectral gap . </S>",
