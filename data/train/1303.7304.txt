    "the linearly polarized spectrum of the sun known as the second solar spectrum exhibits signatures of a number of physical processes not seen in the intensity spectrum and which may also be used to diagnose weak and turbulent magnetic fields that are inaccessible with the ordinary zeeman effect .",
    "many of the most prominent spectral lines in the second solar spectrum , like nai d@xmath3 and d@xmath0 , baii d@xmath3 and d@xmath0 , and caii h and k , are governed by effects of quantum interference between states of different total angular momentum ( @xmath4 or @xmath1 states ) .",
    "the profound importance of quantum interference for the formation of these lines was first demonstrated both observationally and theoretically by .",
    "quantum interference between the @xmath4-states governs the linear polarization signatures of atomic multiplets such as the caii h and k , nai d@xmath3 and d@xmath0 , and cr  i triplet lines .",
    "the theory of such @xmath4-state interference was developed to include the effects of partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) by @xcite .",

    "when an atom possesses nuclear spin the @xmath4 states are split into @xmath1 states ( hyperfine structure splitting ) .",

    "examples of lines governed by @xmath1-state interference are the nai d@xmath0 , baii d@xmath0 , and scii line at 4247 .",
    "the ba  ii d@xmath0 line is due to the transition between the upper fine structure level @xmath5 and the lower level @xmath6 ( see figure  [ level - diag](a ) ) . in the odd isotopes of ba , both the upper and lower levels undergo hyperfine structure splitting ( hfs ) due to the nuclear spin @xmath7 , resulting in four upper and two lower @xmath1-states ( see figure  [ level - diag](b ) ) .",

    "the recording presented in figure  [ ccd ] does not show much spatial variation along the slit , since it represents a very quiet region .",

    "it has long been known that all strong chromospheric scattering lines ( like the ca  i 4227   , na  i d@xmath0 , sr  ii 4079    line , etc ) have such spatial variations .",
    "our observations confirm that the ba  ii d@xmath0 line is no exception , which means that it is sensitive to the hanle effect like the other chromospheric lines .",
    "observations of spatial variations of this line have also been carried out by and @xcite .",
    "to model the polarization profiles of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line we use a procedure similar to the one described in .",

    "the opacities and the collision rates thus obtained are kept fixed , while the reduced stokes vector @xmath83 is computed perturbatively by solving the polarized radiative transfer equation with the angle - averaged redistribution matrices defined in section  [ rt ] .",
    "such a procedure requires a model atom and a model atmosphere as inputs to the rh - code .",
    "the details of the model atom and the atmosphere are discussed in the next subsections .",
    "three different atom models are considered , two for the odd and one for the even isotope .",
    "the atom model for the even isotope ( @xmath84ba ) is given by the five levels of figure  [ level - diag](a ) , while for the odd isotopes ( @xmath35ba and @xmath36ba ) the model is extended to include the hyperfine splitting as described by figure  [ level - diag](b ) .",
    "we neglect the contribution from other less abundant even isotopes .",
    "the wavelengths of the six hyperfine transitions for the odd isotopes are taken from kurucz database and are listed in table  1 .",
    "these transitions are weighted with their line strengths given in equation  ( [ prof - combined ] ) ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we present the results computed for some of the standard realistic 1-d model atmospheres , like fala , falf , falc @xcite and falx @xcite . among these four models",
    "falf is the hottest and falx the coolest .",
    "their temperature structures are shown in the top panel of figure  [ clv ] . however , as will be discussed below , we find that a model atmosphere that is cooler than falx is needed to fit the observed profiles .",
    "the new model , denoted @xmath85 , is obtained by reducing the temperature of the falx model by about 300 k in the height range 500  1200 km above the photosphere .",
    "we have verified that such a modification of the falx model does not significantly affect the intensity spectra .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 spectra turn out to be very sensitive to such temperature changes . like in",
    ", we test the @xmath85 atmosphere by computing the limb darkening function for a range of wavelengths and @xmath86 values and compare it with the observed data from @xcite .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ clv ] .",
    "one can see that @xmath85 and the standard falx fit the observed center - to - limb variation equally well .",
    "therefore small modifications of the temperature structure to achieve a good fit to the observed @xmath2 profile can be made without affecting the model constraints imposed by the intensity spectrum .",
    "in the following we discuss the modeling details and the need for a model atmosphere that is cooler than falx .",
    "this helps us to evaluate the temperature sensitivity of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line and its usefulness for magnetic - field diagnostics .",
    "in addition we demonstrate the profound role that prd plays for the formation of the polarized line profile .        from the three ba  ii atom models described in section  [ model - atom ] we obtain three sets of physical quantities ( two for the odd isotopes and one for the even isotope ) from the rh code .",
    "these quantities include line opacity , line emissivity , continuum absorption coefficient , continuum emissivity , continuum scattering coefficient , and the mean intensity .",
    "the mathematical expressions used to compute these various quantities for the even isotopes are given in @xcite . for the odd isotopes ,",
    "the profile functions in these expressions are replaced by @xmath27 defined by equation  ( [ prof - combined ] ) .",
    "the three sets of quantities are then combined in the ratio of their respective isotope abundances and subsequently used as inputs to the polarization code .",
    "the polarization profiles thus computed for the various model atmospheres are shown in figure  [ all - models ] , displayed separately for the even , odd , and combined even - odd cases in three different panels .",
    "the stokes @xmath2 profiles in figure  [ all - models ] are computed by setting the total abundance of ba in the sun equal to the abundance of even isotopes in the first panel ; the abundance of odd isotopes in the second panel ; and a fractional abundance of even ( 82% ) and odd ( 18% ) isotopes in the third panel .",
    "the profiles in the first panel can be compared to the results presented in figure  6 of .",
    "as seen from the first panel , the amplitude of the central peak for the even isotopes is very sensitive to the temperature structure of the model atmosphere in contradiction with the conclusions of .",
    "also in their paper , the amplitude of the central peak obtained from the falc model is larger than the one obtained from falx , which is opposite to our findings ( although it could be that the version of the falc model they used is not identical to the one that we have used ) .",
    "however , the profile computed with the falx model in first panel of figure  [ all - models ] for the even isotopes is in good agreement with the one given in their paper .",
    "the profiles in the second panel of figure  [ all - models ] , which represent the odd isotopes , also exhibit a similar large sensitivity to the choice of model atmosphere . therefore the combined even - odd isotopes profiles in the third panel are also very sensitive to the temperature structure .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "let us point out that the combined @xmath2 profiles in the bottom panel of figure  [ all - models ] differ profoundly from what one would obtain from a linear superposition of the corresponding profiles for the even and odd isotopes individually in the two other panels , in proportion to their isotope ratios .",
    "the reason is that the combination is highly non - linear , since the lines are formed in an optically thick medium ( namely the radiative transfer effects ) . while the opacities and redistribution matrices are combined in a linear way as described by equations  ( [ phi - g ] ) and ( [ comb - rm ] ) , the even and odd isotopes blend with each other in the radiative transfer process , which makes the combination as it appears in the emergent spectrum highly non - linear .",
    "the drastic depolarization of @xmath2 in the line core has its origin in the polarizability factor @xmath87 of the odd isotopes .",
    "it is well known that the trough like suppression of @xmath87 in the line core for ba  ii is formed due to hyperfine structure for the odd isotopes . in our radiative transfer calculations we have a superposition ( in the proportion of the isotope ratios ) , of the trough - like scattering opacity of the odd isotopes , with the peak - like scattering opacity of the even isotopes .",
    "the shape of the @xmath2 profile depends on the details of radiative transfer and prd ( see equations  ( [ phi - g])-([comb - rm ] ) ) namely on how these two scattering opacities non - linearly blend to produce the net result for the emergent radiation in the optically thick cases .      as seen from the last panel of figure  [ all - models ] ,",
    "the central peak is not well reproduced by any of the standard model atmospheres .",
    "all the models produce a dip at line center .",
    "such a central dip is commonly due to the effects of prd , caused by the properties of the type - ii frequency redistribution . in the case of ba  ii d@xmath0 , the contribution to this central dip comes mainly from the even isotopes , as shown in figure  [ r - ii - dip ] .",
    "the three rows in this figure represent the even , odd and combined even - odd cases , respectively , for the falx model atmosphere .",
    "the first column shows the profiles computed with only type - ii redistribution , the second column those computed with crd only .",
    "the crd profiles are obtained by setting the branching ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "none of the crd profiles shows a central dip .",
    "the occurrence and nature of this central dip has been explored in detail in , who showed that its magnitude is strongly dependent on the choice of atmospheric parameters .",
    "this behavior is also evident from figure  [ all - models ] .",
    "the cooler the atmosphere , the smaller is the central dip .",
    "the dip is often smoothed out by instrumental and macro - turbulent broadening . however , the profiles in figure  [ all - models ] have already been smeared with a gaussian function having a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 70  m . the dip could be suppressed by additional smearing , but such large smearing would also suppress the observed side peaks of the odd isotopes and would make the intensity profile inconsistent with the observed one . the value 70  m  has been chosen to optimize the fit , but it is also consistent with what we expect based on the observing parameters and turbulence in the chromosphere .",
    "the failure of all the tried standard model atmospheres therefore leads us to introduce a new model with a modified temperature structure , which is cooler than the standard falx model .",
    "the details of the new cooler @xmath85 model has been given in section  [ model - atmos ] .",
    "this new model atmosphere succeeds in giving a good fit to both the intensity and the polarization profiles , as shown in figure  [ final - fit ] . to simulate the effects of spectrograph stray light on the intensity and polarization profiles",
    "we have applied a spectrally flat unpolarized background of 4%  of the continuum intensity level to the theoretical @xmath90 profiles . for a good @xmath2 line center fit",
    ", we find that it is necessary to include hanle depolarization from a non - zero magnetic field .",
    "our theoretical profiles are based on a micro - turbulent magnetic field of strength @xmath73 with an isotropic angular distribution .",
    "our best fit to the @xmath2 profile corresponds to a field strength of @xmath73 = 2  g.      the importance of prd in modeling the baii d@xmath0 line has already been demonstrated in , although by only considering the even isotopes .",
    "figure  [ r - ii - dip ] demonstrates the importance of prd for both the odd and the even isotopes . as seen from the second column of this figure",
    ", the @xmath2 profiles for the odd isotopes when computed exclusively in crd do not produce any side peaks , while the profiles computed with type - ii redistribution exhibits such peaks . also , by comparing the @xmath2 profiles for the even isotopes in the first row , we see that crd fails to generate the needed line wing polarization .",
    "a comparison between the observed profiles and the theoretical profiles based on crd alone ( dotted line ) and on full prd ( dashed line ) for the @xmath91 model is shown in figure  [ crd - prd - falxd ] . while the intensity profile can be fitted well using either prd or crd , the polarization profile can not be fitted at all with crd alone .",
    "prd is therefore essential to model the @xmath2 profiles of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line .",
    "in the present paper we have for the first time tried to model the polarization profiles of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line by taking full account of prd , radiative transfer , and hfs effects .",
    "we use the theory of @xmath1-state interference developed in p1 in combination with different atom models representing different isotopes of ba  ii and various choices of model atmospheres .",
    "applications of the well known standard model atmospheres falf , falc , fala , and falx fail to reproduce the central peak , and instead produce a central dip mainly due to prd effects .",
    "we have shown that in the case of ba  ii d@xmath0 the central dip is reduced by lowering the temperature of the atmospheric model .",
    "we can therefore achieve a good fit to the observed polarization profile by slightly reducing the temperature of the falx model .    in modeling the ba  ii d@xmath0 line",
    "we account for the depolarizing effects of elastic collisions with hydrogen atoms but neglect the alignment transfer between the @xmath68 level and the metastable @xmath69 level .",
    "it has been shown by that this alignment transfer affects the line center polarization and is needed for magnetic field diagnostics .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is however not to determine magnetic fields but to clarify the physics of line formation .",
    "we demonstrate that prd is essential to reproduce the triple peak structure and the line wing polarization of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line , but find that the line center polarization is very sensitive to the temperature structure of the atmosphere , which contradicts the conclusions of , who find that the barium line is temperature insensitive and therefore suitable for hanle diagnostics .",
    "this contradiction illustrates that a full prd treatment as done in the present paper , including the contributions from both the even and odd isotopes , is necessary to bring out the correct temperature dependence of the line .",
    "the large temperature sensitivity of the ba  ii d@xmath0 line makes it rather unsuited for magnetic - field diagnostics , since there is no known straightforward way to separate the temperature and magnetic - field effects for this line .                                                , r. , bianda , m. , trujillo bueno , j. , belluzzi , l. , & landi deglinnocenti , e. 2009 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
