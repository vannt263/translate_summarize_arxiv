    "recent studies of hadronic interactions at low energy have revealed that qcd allows wide variety of bound and/or resonance states of hadrons .",
    "for instance , a strong attraction in the s - wave @xmath10 system , which is derived from the chiral symmetric interaction of the kaon as a nambu - goldstone boson , seems to form the @xmath11 baryon resonance in its @xmath12 channel @xcite .",
    "the same interaction will further generate @xmath13nucleus bound states , which are the recent subject of intense study .",
    "similar bound states may appear in systems with heavy quark mesons , such as the @xmath14 and @xmath15 systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of the newly observed quarkonium - like states are found to be better described as bound or resonance states of two heavy - quark mesons @xcite . here",
    "a naive expectation is that due to the large masses of the heavy hadrons , more bound / resonance states may exist in the heavy - quark sector .",
    "such hadronic bound states are very useful in studying the low - energy hadronic interaction which can not be accessed directly from experiment .",
    "for instance , in hypernuclear physics , various interactions of hyperons , where two - body scattering experiments are not available , are determined by the spectroscopy data of light and heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "precise knowledge of those interactions is important as they play crucial roles in understanding properties of dense and hot hadronic matter produced in the early universe or heavy ion collisions as well as compact stars .    in this context ,",
    "heavy quarkonia , @xmath16 or @xmath17 states , may have some new aspects and advantages .",
    "let us consider the ground - state charmonium ( @xmath18 ) states , @xmath19 @xmath20 or @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "their interactions with the nucleon @xmath23 are quite different from the other hadronic interactions .",
    "first , the charmonium and the nucleon have no valence quarks in common , so the interactions mediated by flavor singlet meson exchanges are strongly suppressed by the ozi rule . for the same reason , the pauli exclusion principle for quarks does not cause a repulsion at short distances .",
    "further , a single gluon exchange is prohibited since @xmath24 and @xmath23 are both color singlet . thus the @xmath4 interactions are dominated by multi - gluon exchanges .",
    "the qcd color van der waals interaction , which is a typical multi - gluon exchange interaction , was applied to @xmath4 system by brodsky@xcite .",
    "studies by luke et al.@xcite , kharzeev@xcite and brodsky@xcite showed that the @xmath4 interaction is attractive .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculation@xcite showed that the @xmath0nucleon scattering lengths correspond to weak attractive interactions and thus confirmed the previous studies .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see whether such attraction is enough to form bound states of @xmath25 and nucleus . indeed , considering the heavy mass of the @xmath24 , it is highly possible that @xmath26nucleus bound states exist , when the nucleon number @xmath27 increases@xcite .",
    "the situation may be similar to the case of @xmath28 hypernuclei .",
    "there is no two - body @xmath29 bound state , while three or multi - baryon systems with @xmath28 have bound states .",
    "it is found that the spectroscopy of such hypernuclei provides us with the strengths and detail structures of the @xmath30 interaction .",
    "replacing @xmath28 by @xmath24 or @xmath19 may also reveal the dynamics between the charmonium and the nucleon , the ordinary matter .",
    "for instance , it is interesting to see how strong is the spin - dependent force involving charm quarks .",
    "it is naturally considered that the magnetic gluon coupling is suppressed by the @xmath31 factor , and the spin dependent force of charmonium is weak . with the spin - one @xmath19 bound in nuclei , we will be able to determine the spin dependent forces , i.e. , the spin - spin , spin - orbit and tensor components , of @xmath19 and @xmath23 , quantitatively .",
    "we can also see how the @xmath32nucleus states mix with the @xmath33nucleus .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider bound states of the charmonium with few - nucleon systems .",
    "a standard approach would take a microscopic model or calculation of the @xmath4 interaction and apply it to a nuclear system .",
    "it may , however , be not conclusive because the model settings and parameters have ambiguities and their relations to the obtained binding energies are complex .",
    "we instead employ a phenomenological potential model to represent the charmonium - nucleon interaction and derive relations between the @xmath4 scattering length and the potential parameters .",
    "we then apply the potential to a nuclear system and see whether such a potential gives a bound state or not . concretely",
    ", we consider the @xmath34 and @xmath35he cases and apply the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) @xcite to obtain their binding energies and the wave functions .",
    "then we determine the values of the scattering length which is needed to form a bound state of @xmath24 with the deuteron or @xmath36he . in the end , we find that the scattering length given by the recent lattice qcd may be large enough to make a bound state of @xmath19 in @xmath36he .    in section 2 , we explain our strategy to relate the scattering length of @xmath0nucleon system to the phenomenological potential that we adopt in the nuclear calculation .",
    "then we give a formulation for calculating @xmath0nucleus bound states in section 3 .",
    "we introduce gaussian potentials as effective @xmath4 interactions . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the calculation results .",
    "the relations between the scattering lengths and the potential strengths for @xmath1 and @xmath37 are given first , and subsequently the relations between the scattering lengths and the binding energies of @xmath0nucleus are obtained for the deuteron and @xmath36he . in section 5 , we discuss @xmath38 mixing and the decay of charmonium in nuclei . in section 6 , summary and conclusions are given .",
    "in the previous studies , brodsky  @xcite , wasson  @xcite and belyaev  @xcite assumed a yukawa - type @xmath39 potential @xmath40 while de tramond @xcite additionally assumed a gaussian type potential @xmath41 where @xmath27 and @xmath42 in the yukawa type potential , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the gaussian type potential are the parameters which represent the strengths and the ranges of the potentials , respectively .",
    "usually , these parameters are taken to fit experimental data or microscopic calculations of the scattering length and the other observables of the system .",
    "under the situation with only very limited experimental data , we need to determine or assume the values of these parameters by considering the physical properties of the system to calculate @xmath45nucleus binding energy @xmath46 , as the previous researches have done  @xcite .    here",
    ", we take a different strategy . since the @xmath4 interaction is weak and has short range , the scattering length @xmath3 represents the interaction well and the binding energy @xmath46 of @xmath0nucleus does not depend so much on the details of the form of the potential .",
    "thus we calculate @xmath46 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the good point of this approach is that it gives the correspondence between the binding energy @xmath46 of @xmath0nucleus and the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , whatever the details of the true @xmath4 potential are , as far as they are weak and short ranged , the relation obtained will be valid .",
    "we will show in later chapter that the range dependence of binding energy decreases as the interaction becomes weaker .",
    "in our present approach , we employ the gaussian expansion method ( gem )  @xcite for few - body charmonium - nuclear systems .",
    "this is a variational method which gives the upper limit of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "so once we obtain a bound state ( @xmath47 ) for a given hamiltonian with some trial function , then the true binding could only be deeper for the same hamiltonian .",
    "this is suitable for finding a shallow bound state . in general",
    ", gem provides very accurate eigenvalues and wave functions of few - body systems . then the problem reduces to whether we could give correct hamiltonian , the form of the potentials and the values of parameters .    from a microscopic point of view , it is important to calculate the @xmath4 scattering length from the first principle , such as lattice qcd .",
    "recently , kawanai and sasaki evaluated the scattering lengths of @xmath48 , @xmath2 ( total spin @xmath49 ) , and @xmath2 ( @xmath50 ) in the quenched lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "they found @xmath51 fm and @xmath52 fm with an error of around @xmath53 fm , .",
    "] where sav stands for the spin - averaged value @xmath54 .",
    "this shows that charmonium - nucleon interaction is weak but attractive .",
    "although the error bars overlap with each other , the tendency of @xmath55 can be seen in the result ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the spin - spin interaction is not zero but weak compared to the central force .",
    "it is interesting to see that the spin @xmath56 potential has a stronger attraction than @xmath57 .",
    "in present analysis , we consider @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath19 @xmath60 for the charmonium , both of which are charge neutral and have no electromagnetic interaction . since the @xmath4 interaction due to the qcd color van der waals interaction is weak , states with lower orbital angular momentum @xmath61 , especially the s - wave states ( @xmath62 ) , are important . also we are searching charmonium - nucleus bound states and their binding energies .",
    "thus we only calculate the ground state with @xmath62 .",
    "then , the spin - orbit force does not contribute .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we do not consider the tensor force , which is supposed to be weaker than the central force .",
    "first , we consider an effective @xmath4 potential . for @xmath1 potential",
    ", we only have a spin - independent central force , given by a single gaussian , as @xmath63 for the @xmath2 potential , we introduce not only the spin - independent force but also the spin - spin interaction in order to take into account the spin structure of the @xmath2 interaction , @xmath64 here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the spin operators of the @xmath19 and @xmath23 , respectively . in principle , the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which represent the ranges of the spin - independent part and spin - spin part of the potential respectively , could be different from each other . but",
    "here the details of the shape of the potential is not so important , so we assume for simplicity @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because both the spin - independent and -dependent potentials come from the gluon exchanges and thus the ranges must be similar .",
    "this is in contrast to the nuclear force , where exchanges of various mesons with different masses contribute to the potential .",
    "even if we choose @xmath71 , the results in this paper do not change qualitatively . as we see later in figs .",
    "[ fig : range_dependence1 ] , [ fig : potential_form_dependence ] and [ fig : j_4he_e_a ] , the relations between the @xmath4 two - body scattering lengths and the @xmath0nucleus binding energies are insensitive to the change of the potential ranges .",
    "then , the potentials for the total spin @xmath72 and @xmath73 states are given by @xmath74 the @xmath4 scattering length is calculated by solving the schrdinger equation , @xmath75 at @xmath76 , where we assume the non - relativistic kinematics and the reduced mass is @xmath77 mev for @xmath78 and @xmath79 mev for @xmath80 .      using various values of the @xmath4 potential parameters , we calculate the @xmath34 three - body system using the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) .",
    "three sets of jacobian coordinates for the three - body systems of @xmath34 are illustrated in fig.1 , in which we further take into account the antisymmetrization between two nucleons .",
    "the total hamiltonian and the schrdinger equation are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the kinetic - energy operator and @xmath83 are the potentials between @xmath84 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "for the @xmath84 interaction , we employ the minnesota potential @xcite , which consists of two gaussian terms and has only central forces .",
    "contribution of the tensor force is effectively included in the central potentials .",
    "the potential parameters are adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "the use of minnesota potential is adequate as far as the @xmath85 interaction is weak and nucleon density distribution in nucleus ( deuteron ) is not affected by @xmath86 significantly .",

    "[ fig : range_dependence2 ] that the @xmath205 density distribution shrinks by the emergence of @xmath24 and it shrinks more when the range of the @xmath4 potential is shorter . this is",
    "because in order to give the same value of the scattering length with shorter potential range , the depth of the potential must be deeper and then the effect of @xmath24 attracting nucleons grows rapidly at short distances .",

    "they found no bound state in the @xmath34 ( a=2 ) system , which seems inconsistent with our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_form_dependence ] ) .",
    "one of the reasons could be that they used a folding potential which is folded from the center of the nucleon distribution , not from the center of mass , and did not implement the center of mass correction ( cmc ) , i.e. , did not remove the center of mass motion .",
    "we will see the difference between implementing and not implementing cmc later in the case of @xmath35he .",
    "the other reason could be that they used a folding potential with a fixed nucleon density and ignored the effect of nuclear shrinkage . as can be seen in figs .",

    "while their binding energy of @xmath35he is @xmath245 mev , our result corresponding to the potential for @xmath220 fm used in @xcite is @xmath246 mev .",
    "this difference seems due to the effect of the treatment of the center of mass motion .",

    "the figure shows that the effects of folding from different origin points are quite large in @xmath36he , giving different binding energies , @xmath245 mev and @xmath246 mev .",
    "the difference between using the fermi three - parameter distribution and the gaussian distribution is not so large compared to the difference of using different potentials .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is important to correctly fold the potential from the center of mass of nucleus , not from the center of nucleon distribution , in case of light nucleus such as @xmath36he .",
    "so far we have neglected the decay and the mixing of @xmath19 and @xmath58 in nuclei .",
    "let us discuss briefly about them in this section and show that our results obtained above are not seriously affected by them , especially for the @xmath33nucleus bound states .",

    "the width of @xmath19 is small enough that we expect narrow @xmath19 states in nuclei .    two possible mechanisms , which make the decay width of charmonium(@xmath19 ) nuclear states larger are ( 1 ) the final state interaction of charmonium decay products with nucleon in nucleus , and ( 2 ) the mixing of charmonium - nucleon state with the other hadronic states which retain @xmath263 and @xmath264 quarks .    in the case ( 1 ) for @xmath19 , the final state interaction in nucleus , for example , absorption of @xmath265 made from @xmath19 decay by nucleon in nucleus ,",
    "may enhance the decay width of @xmath19 in nucleus several times larger than in vacuum .",
    "but the decay width of @xmath19 in vacuum is so small ( @xmath266 kev ) that even if it is enhanced for several times larger in nucleus , it still would be small ( @xmath267 mev ) .    in the case",
    "( 2 ) , the decay of @xmath19 going through the mixing with the other hadronic states which divide @xmath263 and @xmath264 quarks separately to the hadrons are prohibited since such hadronic states have larger masses .",
    "for example , the lightest charmed meson and baryon are @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "but the mass of the lightest state which has the same quark components as @xmath270 ( or @xmath271 ) , @xmath272 mev , is much heavier than @xmath273 mev ( and @xmath274 mev ) .",
    "therefore @xmath19 ( and @xmath58 ) in nucleus can not decay by the strong interaction via mixing of these states .",
    "then , the only possible decay process of @xmath19 in this case goes through the mixing of @xmath145nucleus and @xmath275nucleus channels which have the same conserving quantum numbers .",
    "the mixing process can further be divided into two groups .",
    "one is the coherent mixing which retains the nucleus to its ground state in the mixing process , for example , @xmath276deuteron @xmath277deuteron @xmath278 .",
    "the other is the incoherent mixing in which the nucleus is excited ( or broken ) , e.g. , @xmath279he @xmath280h@xmath281 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath58 have the same quark components @xmath24 , it is possible that @xmath145nucleus and @xmath180nucleus states are mixed with each other when their conserving quantum numbers coincide .",
    "the mixing , however , is suppressed in the heavy quark regime , because the mixing requires the spin - flipping interactions of the charm quark .",
    "such interactions are proportional to the inverse of the ( heavy ) quark mass and are thus will be suppressed .",
    "furthermore , for the coherent mixing , @xmath7he and @xmath282 channel of @xmath33deuteron can not have the same @xmath124 with @xmath283he and @xmath275deuteron , respectively , as can be seen in table [ fig : charmonium_nucleus_spin_states ] which lists the coherent mixing channels of @xmath33nucleus and @xmath275nucleus for the nuclei used in the present paper .",

    "in this work , we have introduced effective gaussian potentials for the @xmath4 interaction and obtained the relations between the scattering lengths @xmath3 and the strength parameters , @xmath137 ( eq.([eq : etac_n_potential ] ) ) for @xmath1 and @xmath43 ( eq.([eq : jpsi_n_potential2 ] ) ) for @xmath2 , of the effective potential .",

    "both for @xmath275deuteron and @xmath145deuteron , @xmath204 fm ( @xmath203 @xmath164 ) or @xmath8 fm ( @xmath156 @xmath164 ) is needed to make a bound state . comparing with the lattice qcd data @xmath291 fm and @xmath292 fm  @xcite ,",
    "the obtained results indicate that it is unlikely for the @xmath293 nuclei to make a bound state with charmonia @xmath58 and @xmath19 .",

    "we here note that as far as the binding energy is small , the nucleonic wave function of @xmath36he may not be deformed by the @xmath19 binding",
