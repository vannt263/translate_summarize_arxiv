    "the characterization , quantification , and physical interpretation of quantum correlations more general than entanglement have been the subject of intensive investigation in recent years  @xcite .",
    "early seminal works have identified quantum correlations between two parties , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in a bipartite quantum state by introducing the _ quantum discord _ , namely the difference between the two classically equivalent , but quantum inequivalent , entropic formulas for the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "it occurs that the discord is in general non vanishing not only for entangled states , but also for any separable state @xmath2 which is not locally convertible via a local change of basis to a so - called _ classical - quantum state _ , namely a state of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the set of states forming an orthonormal basis in the state space of subsystem @xmath0 and the @xmath5 are arbitrary states in the state space of subsystem @xmath1 . on general grounds ,",
    "any _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations must satisfy the following minimal set of axioms  @xcite :    * \\i ) it must vanish if and only if the state is a classical - quantum state of the form ( [ classicalquantum ] ) ( faithfulness criterion ) ; * \\ii ) it must be invariant under local unitary transformations ; * \\iii ) it must be non - increasing under local , completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps ( quantum channels ) acting on subsystem @xmath1 ; * \\iv ) it must reduce to an entanglement monotone if @xmath2 is a pure state .",
    "the entropic quantum discord satisfies all these axioms . on the other hand ,",
    "its evaluation requires the highly nontrivial minimization of the entropic functions over all possible local positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) measurements on part @xmath0 , which implies challenging computational difficulties .",
    "this drawback has motivated the search for alternative measures of quantum correlations satisfying the basic axioms and at the same time being computationally tractable  @xcite .",
    "a further , important aspect in the study of quantum correlations concerns their operational interpretation , namely the role that they might play as quantum resources with no classical counterpart in protocols of quantum technologies , ranging from quantum computation and information to metrology and sensing  @xcite .",
    "the operational meaning and the reliability with respect to the basic axioms are thus the relevant guiding principles that need to be considered when looking for computable measures of quantum correlations .",
    "the fact that the entropic discord vanishes on the classical - quantum states has been used to define a _",
    "geometric _ version of the discord , @xmath6 , which characterizes the nonclassical features of a state @xmath2 by quantifying its hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of classical - quantum states , in complete analogy with the geometric measures of entanglement defined in terms of distances from the set of separable states  @xcite .",
    "operational interpretations of the geometric discord have been proposed in terms of remote quantum state preparation and the entanglement that is created between a given quantum system and an apparatus performing a measurement on it  @xcite .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2 is a classical - quantum state , and only in this case , there always exists a local orthogonal projective measurement that leaves the state unchanged .",
    "this means that the states with non - zero discord are necessarily changed by a local projective measurement .",
    "the same observation applies if one replaces local measurements with local unitary operations : _ bona fide _ measures of quantum correlations can be defined by considering the set of all local unitary transformations @xmath7 that can not reduce to the identity , namely those local unitaries with fixed , fully non - degenerate spectrum of eigenvalues as , for example , the spectrum of distinct roots of the unity .",
    "the local unitaries falling in this class necessarily perturb quantum states with nonvanishing discord  @xcite .",
    "a welcome feature of the method based on the response of a quantum state to local unitary perturbations is that it allows to introduce a unified approach to the quantification of entanglement and quantum correlations .",
    "indeed , the bipartite _ entanglement of response _ of pure states of composite quantum systems can be quantified by the change induced by least perturbing local unitary operations and can then be extended to a faithful , full entanglement monotone for mixed states by the convex roof construction  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for earlier related work ) .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the entanglement of response to the discord of response for ( bipartite ) mixed states : @xmath8 where the index @xmath9 denotes the possible different types of well behaved , contractive metrics under completely positive and trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps .",

    "finally , @xmath13 denotes the unitarily perturbed state , and the set of local unitary operations @xmath14 includes all and only those local unitaries with fully nondegenerate spectrum of the complex roots of the unity : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hilbert - space dimension of the unitarily perturbed subsystem .",
    "since it is fully non - degenerate and with equal spacing between eigenvalues , we will denote this spectrum as the _",
    "harmonic spectrum_. the harmonic spectrum is a particular case of fully nondegenerate spectra of complex unimodular numbers .",
    "the most important and physically relevant distances @xmath17 contractive under cptp maps include the trace , the hellinger , and the bures distance .",

    "the trace , hellinger , and bures discords of response provide different quantifications of the response of a quantum state to least - disturbing local unitary perturbations and satisfy all the previously listed four basic axioms that must be obeyed by a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations : they vanish if and only if @xmath2 is a classical - quantum state ; they are invariant under local unitary operations ; they are contractive under cptp maps on subsystem @xmath1 , i.e. the subsystem that is not perturbed by the local unitary operation @xmath7 ; and they reduce to an entanglement monotone for pure states , for one of which they also assume their maximum possible value ( @xmath28 ) .    in this paper we will focus in detail on the study of the bures discord of response : @xmath29 where , in the following , we will drop the superscript and we will identify the bures discord of response with the discord of response _ tout court _ : @xmath30 .    specifically , we will show that the bures discord of response @xmath31 : 1 ) is a faithful measure of quantum correlations satisfying all the basic axioms ; 2 ) reduces to the entanglement of response for pure states ; 3 ) is endowed with a precise operational meaning in terms of state discrimination ; 4 ) possesses a precise quantitative functional relation with the bures geometric discord , i.e. the geometric measure of quantum correlations defined as the distance of a quantum state from the set of classical - quantum states ; and 5 ) allows to define non - trivial instances of maximally quantum correlated states with nonlinear dependence on the global state purity .",
    "similar detailed investigations can be carried out also for the other well - defined discords of response ( trace and hellinger ) and geometric discords ( trace and hellinger ) , and a comprehensive study on the characterization , quantification , and comparison of the different discords of response and different geometric discords is due to appear soon  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bures metric , besides being contractive , shares the unique property of being locally riemannian  @xcite and therefore emerges as a natural tool in characterizing the distinguishability of quantum states and operations . seen as a distance between neighboring operators",
    ", it is immediately related to the fisher information and the cramer - rao bound in the assessment of parameter estimation and quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "these are very important features as , in general , other distances , induced by the schatten @xmath32-norms or their @xmath33 infinite - dimensional analogs , are not simultaneously riemannian and contractive  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the hilbert - schmidt distance is riemannian but not contractive . as already mentioned , the notable contractive exception is the trace distance ( @xmath34 ) which , however , is not riemannian .",
    "the other important instance of contractive distance already mentioned is the hellinger distance , which , given any pair of quantum states @xmath35 , is defined as the hilbert - schmidt distance between their square roots @xmath36 and @xmath37 . on the other hand , simple functions of the bures distance and of the uhlmann fidelity provide exact , _ a priori _ lower and upper bounds to the trace distance @xmath18 .",

    "only a state possessing some amount of quantum correlations can detect unambiguously any local unitary operation _ with a completely non - degenerate spectrum .",

    "since the bures distance is unitarily invariant and contractive under cptp maps ( either local or global ) , the following quantity is a proper measure of quantum correlations : @xmath53 where the perturbed subsystem is the one with smaller hilbert - space dimension , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "this expression defines the ( bures ) discord of response .",
    "the maximization is performed over the set of all local unitary operations with fully nondegenerate spectrum of complex unimodular numbers , and the normalization is chosen such that the distance does not exceed unity , with the absolute upper bound achieved by the maximally entangled pure states . moreover , for pure states @xmath55 is a simple monotonic function of the entanglement of response : @xmath56 therefore , the discord of response satisfies all axioms for a proper measure of quantum correlations .",
    "the discord of response @xmath55 , quantifies the distinguishability between quantum states before and after the application of a local unitary operation with nondegenerate spectrum .",
    "equivalently , it quantifies the minimum possible _ response _ of a composite quantum system in a given state , subject to local unitary perturbations , by identifying the local operation that induces the least perturbing effect .",
    "it is important to understand that this type of distinguishability differs in general from the distinguishability usually considered in the study of quantum correlations , namely how well a local measurement can distinguish between elements of a statistical mixture of quantum states of a composite quantum system .",
    "the asymmetry in treating the subsystems in the definition eq .",
    "( [ quantumness1 ] ) is an intrinsic feature of this type of discord , like many other measures of quantum correlations .",
    "if we take the analogous definition but with minimization defined under local unitary transformations on both subsystems , then one finds that the resulting measure can vanish for some states that do not belong to the set of classical - quantum states .",
    "the simplest relevant example is the one of two - qubit werner states which are invariant under all the transformations of the form @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath59 .",
    "the would - be symmetric bures discord is thus always vanishing for these states and does not define a faithful measure of quantum correlations .",
    "we will now investigate in more detail the role played by the choice of the spectrum of the local unitary operations @xmath60 that enter in the definition of the discord of response .",
    "extremizing over the entire set of local operations @xmath7 without any restriction on their spectrum implies trivially that the minimum is always given by a vanishing discord of response , eq .",
    "( [ quantumness1 ] ) , achieved by the local identity @xmath61 . in order to define a nontrivial discord of response one needs to impose constraints which separate unambiguously the selected classes of unitary transformations from the identity .",
    "proposition [ propuno ] guarantees that every choice of a completely nondegenerate spectrum of @xmath42 provides a measure of quantum correlations that vanishes if and only if the measured state is classical - quantum .",
    "however , each different choice of the spectrum provides a different measure , which can imply different ordering among the states , a situation similar to the case of other measures of nonclassicality , defined in terms of local unitary operations , such as the entanglement of response  @xcite and the local quantum uncertainty  @xcite .    if the perturbed subsystem is a qubit , @xmath62 , or a qutrit , @xmath63 , the condition that @xmath7 is traceless implies a particular case of fully non - degenerate spectrum of unimodular complex numbers , i.e. the so - called harmonic spectrum of equally spaced complex roots of the unity .",
    "the traceless condition provides in these cases the proper separation of @xmath7 from the identity .",
    "this is not the case any more when @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the traceless condition does not guarantee that the spectrum is completely non - degenerate , while harmonicity remains as a sufficient condition to this end , and other choices are possible .    on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of the harmonic spectrum , i.e. with homogeneously spaced eigenvalues , can be strongly motivated and justified on physical grounds .",
    "indeed , the shape of the spectrum becomes an especially delicate problem for higher - dimensional systems ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "although any choice of a generic non - degenerate spectrum yields a vanishing discord if and only if the state is classical - quantum , the density and spacing of eigenvalues will determine the main character of the different measures .",
    "suppose we choose an inhomogeneous spectrum . in this case",
    ", if there are subspaces associated to very similar eigenvalues of @xmath7 , in such subspaces the local unitary transformations will act almost like the identity . the quantum correlations between these subspaces and the rest of the system will then be weighted very poorly by the corresponding discord of response , and will be almost completely hidden . to illustrate this point in more detail ,",
    "let us consider a composite system @xmath66 , where the state of party @xmath67 is maximally entangled , while the state of party @xmath68 is a product state , and we choose a non - degenerate but inhomogeneous spectrum of local unitary operations @xmath69 .",
    "the minimization over @xmath69 will then tend to minimize the impact of the maximally entangled part acting on @xmath0 .",
    "this impact will become ever vanishingly smaller the closer are the eigenvalues of @xmath69 , while intuitively one should expect exactly the opposite behaviour , i.e. that the maximally entangled subsystem should give a significant contribution to the quantum discord between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this example shows that the unitary transformations of non - degenerate but non - uniformly distributed spectrum introduces non - equivalent weights to the correlations in different subspaces of the system . to avoid such spurious situations the only sensible choice appears to be that of the harmonic spectrum .",

    "this type of discord of response characterizes the difference between the maximal probability of error in the above scenario and the classical head - tail value 1/2 , i.e. the absolute maximum of the error probability .    at this point",
    "let us discuss again the role played by the choice of the spectrum of the local unitary operations in the definition of the discord of response .",
    "the following proposition shows that if subsystem @xmath0 is a qubit , then the choice of the harmonic spectrum yields the smallest possible maximal probability of error .",
    "this in turn implies that the choice of the harmonic spectrum is the optimal one in order to code messages via unitary operations :    [ proptr2 ] consider an arbitrary bi - partite transmitter state @xmath52 , where subsystem @xmath0 is a qubit , @xmath62 , and subsystem @xmath1 is arbitrary finite - dimensional .",
    "assume that we encode the message using the identity channel @xmath137 and an arbitrary unitary channel @xmath7 , both occurring with equal probabilities .",
    "then , the maximal probability of error of discrimination between the outputs of the operations given by @xmath137 and by @xmath7 is smallest if the spectrum of @xmath7 is harmonic .",
    "the proof is given in appendix  [ appprop2 ] . at the moment there is no proof for @xmath138 and the task appears challenging .",
    "the result of the above proposition suggests that the choice of the harmonic spectrum for the local unitary operations that define the discord of response provides the optimal estimation of some crucial figure of merit in quantum reading protocols .",
    "indeed , since the trace distance @xmath136 is challenging to evaluate in many relevant instances , for example in the case of repeated sampling  @xcite or in the case of gaussian probe states  @xcite , useful estimators such as the quantum chernoff bound  @xcite and the bures distance @xmath139 can come at hand .",
    "in particular , the latter allows to derive lower and upper bounds on the error probability thanks to the following relations to the trace distance : @xmath140 indeed , these two distances are topologically equivalent  @xcite .",
    "this means that if two states become closer to each other with respect to one of these measures they are also closer to each other with respect to the other measure .",
    "moreover , the bounds in ineq .",
    "( [ burestracerelation ] ) are simple functions of the quantum chernoff bound if one of the states is pure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the discord of response allows to show the crucial advantage of quantum reading over the classical reading .",
    "in particular , our results imply that the states with large discord of response are able to read any coding by means of local unitary operations , while this is impossible for classical - quantum transmitters , i.e. transmitters with vanishing discord of response",
    ".    the results of the present paper may also find interesting applications in the context of metrology , particularly for interferometry and phase estimation  @xcite .",
    "in such problems one has to estimate some unknown phase @xmath141 introduced at one arm of an interferometer by a unitary transformation @xmath142 , while the generating hamiltonian @xmath143 is either unknown or characterized only by its spectrum .",
    "the precision of the phase determination is estimated by the interferometric power , a function of the quantum fisher information @xmath46 dependent on the probing state and the generating hamiltonian @xmath143 . not knowing explicitly @xmath143 , one has to minimize the fisher information over all hamiltonians @xmath143 in order to characterize the precision of the phase estimation . for arbitrary states",
    "@xmath144 the quantum fisher information @xmath145 reads @xmath146 and the associated interferometric power reads @xmath147 it has been recently found that @xmath148 is nonvanishing only for discordant states and can be suitably maximized , e.g. with experimental setups based on nmr technology  @xcite . in this scenario , for local generating hamiltonians",
    "@xmath149 with non - degenerate spectrum we can characterize the sensitivity of the probed state on the action of @xmath150 by the bures distance between the state perturbed locally by @xmath150 and the unperturbed state after minimization over all local hamiltonians @xmath149 with fixed non - degenerate spectrum .",
    "such a measure vanishes if and only if there exists a local hamiltonian which does not perturb the probing state . as a consequence , the results presented in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] of the present work identify the states of given purity which are most sensitive to the action of unknown local hamiltonians .",
