    "the discovery with iras of a large infrared excess around vega ( aumann et al .",
    "1984 ) initiated the detailed study of other planetary systems .",
    "we can now use the dust emission from main sequence stars to constrain models for the origin and evolution of these environments ( lagrange , backman & artymowicz 2000 , zuckerman 2001 ) with the long - term goal of developing a more comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution of planets and related minor bodies .",
    "most previous studies of the dust around main - sequence stars have been restricted to using broad - band infrared fluxes ( e. g. habing et al .",
    "2001 , spangler et al .",
    "2001 ) . here , we report measurements with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , houck et al .",
    "2004 ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( werner et al . 2004 ) of 19 main - sequence stars .",
    "we obtained spectra of main sequence stars with previously reported iras excesses with both the short - low ( 5.2  14.5 @xmath1 m ) and long - low ( 14.0  38.0 @xmath1 m ; @xmath6 @xmath3 90 ) modules on the irs . table 1 lists the six targets in our sample with strong infrared excesses .",
    "we did not detect a substantial excess around 13 other stars .",
    "an example of a star without a strong excess is hr 4732 ; its spectrum ( from _ spitzer _ aor 0003579392 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the other stars without strong excesses are hd 16157 ( aor 0003554560 ) , hd 221354 ( aor 0003565842 ) , hr 818 ( aor 0003554816 ) , hr 1338 ( aor 0003555584 ) , hr 2015 ( aor 0003556608 ) , hr 3220 ( aor 0003557888 ) , hr 3862 ( aor 0003558400 ) , hr 5447 ( aor 0003560192 ) , hr 8085 ( aor 0003564544 ) , hr 8549 ( aor 0003588608 ) , hr 8799 ( aor 0003565568 ) and ross 128 ( aor 0003559168 ) .    in order to avoid time - consuming peak - up on our relatively bright targets with accurately known positions",
    ", we operated the observatory in irs spectral mapping mode where a 2x3 raster ( spatial x dispersion ) centered on the star is performed .",
    "the slit positions were separated by half of the slit width in the dispersion direction , and by a third of the slit length in the spatial direction .",
    "we carried out the bulk of the reduction and analysis of our spectra with the irs teams smart program ( higdon et al 2004 ) .",
    "we started with intermediate products from the _ spitzer _ irs data - reduction pipeline , that lacked only stray light and flat - fielding corrections .",
    "we extracted point - source spectra for each nod position using a uniformly weighted column profile for which the variable width scales with the width of the instrumental pointspread function .",
    "we also made similar spectral extractions for observations of our photometric standard star , @xmath7 lac ( a1v ) .",
    "then we divided each target spectrum , nod position by nod position , by the spectrum of the standard star , multiplied the quotient by the appropriate template spectrum ( cohen et al 2003 ) , and averaged the resulting spectra from corresponding nod positions .",
    "we plot the resulting spectra of our targets with ir excesses in figure 1 . based upon comparisons of irs spectra of non - variable calibration sources to ground - based , iras , and _ spitzer _ irac flux densities , we estimate that the absolute spectrophotometric accuracy of these spectra is 10% ( 1@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is important to distinguish this absolute photometric accuracy , which describes the vertical positions of the spectra on our plots relative to the flux density scale , from the point - to - point fluctuation in the spectra , which is a measure of the precision of our spectral feature strengths and therefore of our ability to identify spectral features and compare them to our models . in general ,",
    "the accuracy of our spectral feature identifications and feature strengths is limited by the point - to - point scatter ( currently much larger than the system noise , in bright objects ) that is visible in the spectra .",
    "therefore almost all features that significantly exceed the fluctuations , and are wider than the two - pixel irs spectral resolution element , are significant .",
    "the lack of spectral features that we refer to in this paper is based on this criterion .",
    "to interpret the data for the infrared excess , we need luminosities , @xmath9 , and ages , @xmath10 , of the stars .",
    "we take distances , @xmath11 , from _ hipparcos _ , apparent magnitudes from the yale bright star catalog , assume no interstellar reddening , and use the bolometric corrections given by flower ( 1996 ) to infer the total luminosities . for four stars ,",
    "we adopt published estimated ages . for hr 506 , the age is highly uncertain since zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) and decin et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) estimate 0.3 gyr and 3.0 gyr , respectively . in view of the recently measured lithium abundance of 2.6 on the usual 12-point logarithmic scale ( israelian et al .",
    "2004 ) , we adopt the younger age . for hr 333 and hr 3927 , we assume ages of 0.1 gyr , representative of dusty main sequence a - type stars ( song et al . 2001 ) .      the dust continua for @xmath0 @xmath12 20 @xmath1 m show no spectral features .",
    "if the particles are spheres of diameter @xmath13 , then any spectral features that might be present are weakened if @xmath13 @xmath12 @xmath14 ( e. g. spitzer 1978 , wolf & hillenbrand 2003 ) .",
    "our data thus suggest that the diameter of the grains is larger than 10 @xmath1 m , as predicted by models such as those of krivov , mann & krivova ( 2000 ) and found for the particles that produce the zodiacal light in the solar system ( fixsen & dwek 2002 ) .",
    "a standard model of dust debris systems assumes that collisions among a population of large , unseen parent bodies produces smaller , detectable dust particles ( lagrange et al . 2000 , zuckerman 2001 ) . some of the best studied systems such as hr 4796a exhibit a well defined ring of material ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) . very approximately ,",
    "for circumstellar envelopes with @xmath15 @xmath12 10@xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the characteristic luminosity of the infrared excess in the 30 @xmath1 m spectral window , or @xmath18 at 30 @xmath1 m ) , particle - particle collisions typically are the most important grain destruction mechanism ( e. g. krivov , mann & krivova 2000 , wyatt & dent 2001 ) . in these relatively dusty environments , the grains do not migrate far before they are fragmented into sufficiently small pieces that they are driven out of the system by radiation pressure .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of the dust reproduces the spatial distribution of the parent bodies which might be determined by the history of planet formation in the system . in contrast , in less dusty envelopes with @xmath15 @xmath19 10@xmath16 , mutual collisions are not so important , and the grains spiral inwards under the poynting - robertson drag . in such models ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the grains need not reproduce that of the parent bodies .",
    "motivated by these models of dust debris , we consider two possible fits to the reduced data .",
    "first , we fit the spectra by a function of the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants .",
    "the first term in equation ( 1 ) describes the photospheric emission while the second term represents the infrared excess .",
    "we show in figure 1 the comparison of our best fits with the data , and we list in table 1 our values for @xmath22 and @xmath15 where @xmath17 is @xmath23 . equation ( 1 ) fits the spectra for the two stars with the lowest values of @xmath15 , hr 1570 and @xmath0 boo . however , the infrared excesses of four stars require another model since fits using equation ( 1 ) either underestimate the observed photospheric fluxes measured at @xmath0 @xmath24 12 @xmath1 m ( hr 333 and hr 3927 ) or the measured iras and/or iso fluxes ( decin et al .",
    "2000 ) at @xmath0 = 60 @xmath1 m ( hr 506 and hr 1082 ) .    our second method to model the infrared excess is to fit a single temperature to the dust particles so the total flux is fit with a function of the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the planck function . in principle",
    ", @xmath27 must equal @xmath21 , but the absolute level of our spectra is somewhat uncertain because of imprecise calibration .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , we can fit our infrared spectra adequately with equation ( 2 ) with the values of @xmath28 given in table 1 ranging from 72 k to 114 k.    the spectral energy distribution of the infrared excess can test the models . if poynting - robertson drag dominates , the spectrum varies as @xmath29 ( e. g. buitrago & mediavilla 1985 ) , the dust is smeared over a wide range of radii and equation ( 1 ) should fit the data .",
    "in contrast , in a model where collisions limit the lifetime of the particles , then inward drift is not as important and the dust is more concentrated near its birthplace . in environments with @xmath15 @xmath12 10@xmath16 , there might be a dust ring or at least a well defined inner hole to the dust distribution which achieves a characteristic maximum temperature . within the limited irs spectral range , equation ( 2 ) can fit the data .",
    "inner dust truncations might be the result of the formation of low mass companions which might be planets ( kenyon & bromley 2002 ) , but other models can produce rings as well ( takeuchi & artymowicz 2002 ) . also , since @xmath28 is near 100 k , if water ice is an important constituent of the material , there may be substantial grain destruction by sublimation which contributes to the observed deficiency of warm grains ( jura et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we now estimate some parameters for the circumstellar dust .",
    "we assume that the particles radiate like black bodies so that particles at temperature @xmath30 lie at distance @xmath31 from the star : @xmath32 for the two stars where the spectra can be fit by equation ( 1 ) , there is no constraint on the maximum temperature and thus no evidence for any inner truncation in the dust distribution .",
    "there are four stars where we use equation ( 2 ) to fit the data , and we thus find a characteristic grain temperature , which , from equation ( 3 ) , we can translate into a distance from the star . using the values of @xmath28 and @xmath9 given in table 1 ,",
    "we find values for the inner boundary of the dust of 48 au , 11 au , 52 au and 54 au around hr 333 , hr 506 , hr 1082 and hr 3927 , respectively .",
    "consistent with models for those dust debris systems where frequent collisions lead to smaller particles which are then ejected by radiation pressure , the stars with the strongest evidence for inner holes in the dust distribution have the highest values of @xmath15 . if the inner holes are caused by inner planets , then in the future , with sufficiently high angular resolution , it may be possible to identify azimuthal asymmetries in the dust which might indicate gravitational perturbations by this unseen system of planets ( e. g. wyatt 2003 ) .",
    "we can also use our data to make a rough estimate of the minimum mass of the parent bodies , @xmath33 . since poynting - robertson drag provides a maximum grain lifetime , then in an approximate steady state ,",
    "we can write ( chen & jura 2001 ) : @xmath34 this estimate of @xmath33 is insensitive to the grain size and composition ; the minimum values of @xmath33 derived from equation ( 4 ) are shown in table 1 . in systems with @xmath15 @xmath35 10@xmath16 , collisions among dust grains occur often , the poynting - robertson lifetime is thus much longer than the collision time , and we may severely underestimate @xmath33 .",
    "there may also be large objects such as planets that are not experiencing rapid collisions and which do not contribute to the detected dust .",
    "we show in table 1 that the inferred lower bounds to @xmath33 range from 0.004 m@xmath2 to 0.06 m@xmath2 .",
    "the summed mass of the kbos in the solar system is uncertain and is currently estimated to be between 0.02 m@xmath2 and 0.1 m@xmath2 ( bernstein et al . 2003 ; luu & jewitt 2002 ) .",
    "typical analogs of the kuiper belt may have total masses @xmath24 0.1 m@xmath2 ( jura 2004 ) . since we observed stars with notable infrared excesses , we probably selected objects with particularly massive systems of parent bodies . in the solar system ,",
    "the value of the infrared luminosity of the dust is @xmath3 10@xmath36 l@xmath37 ( e. g. fixsen & dwek 2002 ) .",
    "either the mass of parent bodies around our sample of stars is much larger than the inferred minimum , or the collision rate of these objects is substantially greater than in the kuiper belt of the solar system .",
    "two of the stars in table 1 , @xmath0 boo itself and hr 1570 , are @xmath0 boo stars , a subclass of @xmath32% of all main - sequence a - type stars that is defined as having nearly solar abundances of c , n and o , but marked deficiencies of fe elements by factors of 10100 ( paunzen et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the explanation for this abundance pattern is not known .",
    "one theory to account for their surface abundances is that they have preferentially accreted some circumstellar matter ( venn & lambert 1990 ) , and within the star s atmosphere there is an element - dependent chemical separation controlled by gravitational settling and radiative acceleration at the base of the thin outer convection zone of the star ( turcotte & charbonneau 1993 ) . as shown in jura ( 2004 ) , the rate at which circumstellar dust is being produced scales as the infrared excess luminosity such that @xmath38 @xmath3 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the speed of light .",
    "we therefore find from the results in table 1 that @xmath38 @xmath310@xmath4 g s@xmath5 for both @xmath0 boo and hr 1570 . according to turcotte & charbonneau ( 1993 ) , hydrogen - rich gas infall rates of @xmath4110@xmath42 g s@xmath5 with selective accretion of @xmath4110@xmath4 g",
    "s@xmath5 of metals in dust is required to explain the surface abundances of @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "while more sophisticated treatments are required to the accretion / diffusion models , our results at least show that metal infall at the required rate appears to be occuring around @xmath0 boo stars .    in models for the first 100 myr of the solar system , petit , morbidelli & chambers ( 2001 )",
    "have computed that approximately 50% of the @xmath35 m@xmath2 of planetesimals initially within the asteroid belt had their orbits perturbed by jupiter so they hit the sun .",
    "murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have argued that such models can be generally extended to other main sequence stars .",
    "assuming that this accretion of @xmath35 @xmath43 10@xmath42 g s@xmath5 of rocky material often occurs , the atmospheres of the a stars should be substantially polluted .",
    "we speculate that the main sequence stars with inner holes in their dust distributions may also be systems with asteroidal belts where gravitational perturbations by giant planets leads to a significant supply of metals to an atmosphere where they would be otherwise depleted .",
    "an infall of large rocks or asteroids may lead to observable variations in the abundance of the elements in the star s atmosphere ( cowley 1977 ) which could be different from the effects of dust inflows occuring around the @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "we have obtained _ spitzer _ mid - infrared spectra of 19 main - sequence stars .",
    "our data are most useful for constraining the evolution of the solid material in regions between @xmath310 au and @xmath360 au from the stars .",
    "we conclude the following :    * there are no strong spectral features ; we suggest that the typical diameter of a dust particle is greater than 10 @xmath1 m . * the infrared excesses can be explained by dust arising from collisions between parent bodies whose minimum total mass lies between 0.004 m@xmath2 and 0.06 m@xmath2 .",
    "these derived minimum masses are comparable to the total mass of kbos in the solar system .",
    "* we estimate dust production rates of @xmath310@xmath4 g s@xmath5 around @xmath0 boo and hr 1570 ; selective accretion of this material may help explain their peculiar surface abundances .",
    "* there appear to be inner truncations in the dust clouds at 48 au , 11 au , 52 au and 54 au around hr 333 , hr 506 , hr 1082 and hr 3927 , respectively .",
