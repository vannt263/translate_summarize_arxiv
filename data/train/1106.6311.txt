    "at least two types of instabilities , related with attractive interactions , are known : pomeranchuk@xcite and superconducting instabilities .",
    "pomeranchuk instabilities occur in the presence of two - body interactions containing a strong attractive component in the forward scattering channel with definite angular momentum . in the context of landau theory",
    ", the instability sets in when one or more dimensionless landau parameters @xmath1 , with angular momentum @xmath2 in the charge ( @xmath3 ) or spin ( @xmath4 ) channel , acquire large negative values .",
    "pomeranchuk instabilities in a charge sector spontaneously break rotational symmetry@xcite .",
    "in particular , an instability in the @xmath5 channel produces an ellipsoidal deformation of the fermi surface@xcite . from a dynamical point of view , the resulting anisotropic ground state is a non - fermi liquid , due to over - damped goldstone modes that wipe out quasi - particle excitations@xcite .",
    "instabilities in the spin channel are also very interesting . for instance , the ferromagnetic stoner instability@xcite occurs when @xmath6 acquires large negative values , producing a divergence in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this phase transition preserves rotational symmetry , however it breaks time - reversal symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to have spin instabilities that preserve time - reversal invariance@xcite .",
    "higher order angular momentum interactions produce anisotropic as well as isotropic phases .",
    "several examples were studied in detail@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 channel have special interest . when @xmath7 , an ordered isotropic and time reversal invariant phase is possible .",
    "this phase , called @xmath8-phase in ref .",
    "[ ] , dynamically generates a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is a very interesting possibility , since it allows the generation of spin - orbit couplings from many - body correlations , differently from the usual one - particle relativistic effect .    on the other hand ,",
    "superconductivity in the presence of spin - orbit interactions is nowadays of great interest@xcite .",
    "superconductivity is developed in the presence of a small attractive interaction in the particle - particle ( bcs ) channel .",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) state is generally characterized by a complex order parameter which breaks gauge symmetry , @xmath9 , where the operator @xmath10 creates an electron with spin @xmath11 at the position @xmath12 .",
    "the usual classification of @xmath13 as s - wave , d - wave , p - wave , etc , resides in the irreducible representations of the lattice point group . also , the absence of spin - orbit interactions allows the additional differentiation between singlet and triplet order parameters .",
    "however , the sc state could also break lattice translation and/or rotational symmetry . in that case",
    ", this classification is no more possible .",
    "one particular example is an oscillating order parameter like @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an ordering wave - vector . in a modulated superconducting state , proposed by fulde , ferrell , larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite ( fflo state )",
    ", the spatial modulation of the cooper pairing is due to a mismatch of fermi surfaces , produced by an external magnetic field ( by zeeman effect ) .",
    "fflo states have also been proposed to occur in other scenarios like in imbalanced cold atoms with different species@xcite and in heavy fermions systems when different orbitals hybridize under external pressure@xcite . also , for generally non - local bcs potentials , a modulated sc order parameter can coexist with charge density waves@xcite .",
    "recently , a striped order parameter , called `` pair density wave , ( pdw ) '' , was proposed@xcite to explain anomalous transport properties observed in cuprates superconductors .",
    "although pomeranchuk and bcs instabilities are generated by attractive interactions , they are competing ones .",
    "a superconducting gap suppresses fermi surface deformations .",
    "a detailed example of this effect can be observed by considering the competition between d - wave pomeranchuk instabilities and a d - wave superconducting order parameter@xcite .    in the spin channel , due to time - reversal symmetry breaking , a stronger competition is expected .",
    "however , it is possible to have instabilities with higher angular momentum that preserve time - reversal invariance . in this paper",
    ", we analyze an example of this class of systems .",
    "in particular , the @xmath8-phase@xcite opens the possibility of the formation of cooper pairs with zero helicity and finite momentum , possibly producing a modulated superconducting state .",
    "the main point of this paper is to report on the competing character of cooper pairing and a pomeranchuk instability in the @xmath0 spin channel .",
    "our model is based on a 2d fermi liquid with interactions in the @xmath16 channel and a general attracting interaction favoring cooper pairing .",
    "the main results are summarized in the phase diagram of figure ( [ pd ] ) , obtained in a self - consistent mean - field approximation described below . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the system is in the usual s - wave sc state .",
    "when @xmath18 the pomeranchuk instability sets in and we observe two types of superconducting phases . at low coupling @xmath19 , there is a splitting of the fermi surface into two branches , labeled by helicity eigen - values and , the mean field solution is a p - wave superconducting state coming from intra - band pairing .",
    "notice that the pairing is in the helicity basis , since the spin in no longer a good quantum number .",
    "the use of the term p - wave refers to the symmetry of the superconducting gap obtained . for greater coupling ,",
    "pomeranchuk instability is suppressed continuously and the s - wave superconducting state reappears discontinuously at the bold line .",
    "therefore , at mean field level ( and zero temperature ) there is a first order phase transition between two different sc states .",
    "moreover , for a stronger bcs coupling , a modulated superconducting phase could appear with a finite wave - vector @xmath20 , given roughly by @xmath21 , produced by inter - band bcs couplings .",
    "however , this phase is metastable at mean field level .     and the dimensionless antisymmetric landau parameter with angular momentum @xmath0 , @xmath22 . above the solid line ,",
    "the system is mainly in an s - wave superconducting state ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "below this line , for @xmath26 and for small @xmath19 , the system continuously develops an spontaneous spin - orbit interaction , given by the order parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the s - wave order parameter goes to zero discontinuously at this line , where a superconducting order with @xmath28-wave symmetry , coexisting with a spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath8-phase ) appears .",

    "where the operator @xmath59 is diagonalized with eigenvalues @xmath60 , the mean - field hamiltonian takes the simpler form @xmath61 with the self - consistent equation @xmath62 therefore , if @xmath29 ( with @xmath63 ) , there is a dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian studied in this example is similar to the 2d rashba spin - orbit coupling , characterized by a ground state in which the spin configuration has a vortex structure in momentum space@xcite with winding number @xmath64 . in the pomeranchuk transition",
    "it is also possible to obtain a dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling in which the vortex structure has winding number @xmath65 .",
    "however , both couplings produce the same splitting of the fermi surface as described in fig .",
    "( [ fig.fs ] ) .",

    "the gap equation is written as @xmath132 where @xmath119 , and we have defined the function @xmath133 with @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 . therefore , to look for modulated superconductivity we need to solve eqs .",

    "firstly , we note that for @xmath137 the only solution , @xmath138 , corresponds to the uniform superconducting phase .",
    "this imposes a lower limit for modulated superconductivity since , for obtaining a non - trivial solution , we must have @xmath139 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that modulated superconductivity is a strong coupling effect .",
    "however , for any value of the parameter @xmath140 , the uniform superconducting mean - field energy is always lower than the modulated one , @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a region of the phase diagram , shown above the dashed line in figure ( [ pd ] ) , in which @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , modulated superconductivity appears as a metastable phase for large values of @xmath19 and @xmath143 .",
    "the precise location of the onset of metastability depends on the relation between the band - width in which interactions are relevant ( the energy cut - off ) , and the band - curvature at the fermi surface .",
    "we would like to note that , the meta - stable character of the modulated sc phase may depend on the symmetry of the form factor used to define the effective bcs coupling .",
    "summarizing , we have studied , in the context of fermi liquids , the competition between a pomeranchuk instability in the spin channel with angular momentum @xmath0 , triggered by the landau parameter @xmath144 and an attractive interaction favoring cooper - pair formation .",
    "we built up a zero temperature mean - field phase diagram in terms of the two parameters of the model : @xmath144 and @xmath19 .",
    "we found that , as observed in other channels of pomeranchuk instabilities@xcite , the superconducting gap reduces the tendency to fermi surface deformation .",
    "we have considered intra - band homogeneous pairing as well as inter - band pairing .",
    "the net effect of the former is to produce a @xmath28-wave superconductor state for very small values of the bcs coupling constant .",
    "then , we have shown that , for stronger couplings , a first order p - wave / s - wave phase transition takes place .",
    "moreover , we have found a metastable modulated superconductor , enhanced for larger values of @xmath145 .    the phase diagram of figure ( [ pd ] )",
    "could be modified by long wave - length fluctuations in several ways . in the @xmath8-phase",
    ", there are three branches of goldstone modes transforming with @xmath146 group , associated with the breaking of relative spin - orbit symmetry .",
    "the longitudinal mode has a linear dispersion relation , while the transverse modes signal a tendency to produce a non - homogeneous ground state with parity symmetry breaking@xcite , meaning that , in the absence of sc interactions , the mean field solution of the @xmath8-phase is actually meta - stable .",
    "however , an explicit so coupling ( @xmath42 ) can gapped the goldstone modes , stabilizing the phase and rounding the pomeranchuk instability . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that a modulated superconductor order parameter can coexist , at strong coupling , with non - homogeneous charge configurations@xcite .",
    "this coexistence has also been proposed in the context of cuprates superconductors@xcite .",
    "for this reason , we believe that transverse long - wave fluctuations of the @xmath8-phase could probably enhance the modulated sc order .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is still no experimental evidence of the phases described in this paper .",
    "however , we believe that they could be possibly observed in systems with attractive interactions in the antisymmetric @xmath0 channel .",
    "negative values of the landau parameter @xmath144 have been measure@xcite in systems like @xmath147 .",
    "also , in ultra cold atomic gases with a p - wave feshbach resonance@xcite , @xmath144 should be negative near the resonance .",

    "<S> we study the competition between a pomeranchuk instability in the spin channel with angular momentum @xmath0 and an attractive interaction , favoring cooper - pair formation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the superconducting gap strongly suppresses the phase space for the pomeranchuk instability . </S>",
    "<S> we computed a mean - field phase diagram displaying a first order transition between two superconductor phases with different symmetries : p - wave ( with spontaneously generated spin - orbit interaction ) and s - wave for greater values of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have looked for a possible modulated superconducting phase . we have found that this phase appears only as a meta - stable state in the strong coupling regime . </S>"
