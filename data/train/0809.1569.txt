    "it is well known that random fluctuations can seriously affect charge transport in semiconductors  @xcite , which usually leads to deterioration of their performance .",
    "however , recently the constructive role of noise in semiconductor devices has been recognized . in particular ,",
    "noise was shown to induce coherent radiation in semiconductor lasers @xcite or to induce moving field domains in semiconductor superlattices  @xcite whose regularity becomes optimum at some non - zero value of the noise intensity .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ coherence resonance _ @xcite . in double - barrier",
    "resonant tunneling ( dbrt ) diodes noise can generate spatially inhomogeneous current density patterns in form of breathing current filaments  @xcite , however , their regularity decreases monotonically with increasing noise intensity , and thus shows no coherence resonance .",
    "the control of the features of noise - induced dynamics is generally of great importance , and has recently attracted a lot of attention in the field of nonlinear dynamic systems @xcite . in",
    "@xcite a method for manipulation of essential features of noise - induced oscillations , like coherence and time scales , was proposed using a delayed feedback scheme that was originally used to control chaos in purely deterministic systems  @xcite .",
    "this technique was demonstrated to be effective for control of noise - induced oscillations in either simple ( generic ) systems  @xcite or more complex , spatially extended systems@xcite .",
    "for the dbrt nanostructure it was shown that time - delayed feedback can either increase of decrease the regularity of noise - induced breathing filaments and , moreover , can even lead to spatial homogenization of current density patterns  @xcite .",
    "for deterministic systems the original _ single _ time delayed feedback was extended by using multiples of the delay time @xmath0 weighted with a memory parameter @xcite , which generally leads to larger control domains and more efficient control @xcite . in a simple stochastic van der pol oscillator this has also been shown to yield drastically increased correlation times @xcite .    in the present work we study the effect of _ multiple _ time delayed feedback on the stochastic spatio - temporal pattern formation in the dbrt model .",
    "compared to the _ single _ time delayed feedback in the same system  @xcite , we find much sharper resonances of the spectral and correlation properties in dependence upon the delay time . for parameter values close to , but below , a hopf bifurcation",
    "we show that in these sharp , pronounced resonances the temporal regularity is significantly increased and the power spectral width becomes much narrower .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the use of multiple time delays enlarges the control parameter regime in which the original deterministic dynamical properties of the system do not change , i.e. the delay - induced bifurcations occur only at larger feedback strength .",
