    "the intensity variation with laser excitation energy is much more complicated .",
    "the intensities of the individual spe components rise and fall markedly with laser energy , as has been observed experimentally .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows that , in the present situation , peaks in the optical absorption coincide with peaks in the raman intensities , which leads to the conclusion that the latter are related to incoming ( absorption ) resonances .",
    "note that from fig .",
    "[ fig8]b it follows that interference effects among intermediate states are weak in the raman scattering under extreme resonance@xcite .",
    "raman spectra in the extreme resonance region look similar to the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but with spe peaks much higher than collective ones and selectively enhanced for particular values of @xmath7 .",
    "a comparison with the density of energy levels would lead to results very similar to those of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec2]g , we assume that @xmath10 experiences a sudden increase when @xmath140 . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of these states to @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , loses its resonant character even when @xmath7 sweeps this energy range .",
    "it means that peak intensities become smooth functions of @xmath7 , as for below band gap excitation .",
    "both collective and spe raman peaks decrease in intensity for @xmath141 ( as compared with values at extreme resonance ) , but the spe peaks are more strongly depressed @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows a typical spectrum at @xmath142 mev .",
    "nevertheless , a modest increase of the peak intensity for @xmath7 well above the band gap may result not only from large values of latexmath:[$|\\langle f|\\hat h^+_{e - r}|int\\rangle \\langle int|\\hat h^-_{e - r }    compared with the neighboring levels ) .",
    "there could be a set of intermediate states in which @xmath10 takes relatively small values .",
    "one can think , for example , of the lowest state in a sub - band , let us say the @xmath144 electron sub - band .",
    "inter sub - band transitions due to phonon emission are not as fast as intra sub - band transitions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the @xmath10 of the lowest state in the sub - band is relatively small .",
    "we will call these states `` excitonic '' states , x. if the product @xmath145 is not small , a peak in the raman intensity will appear . in the interpretation of ref .",
    ", this is an `` incoming '' resonance .    on the other hand , `` outgoing '' resonances correspond to emitted photons with energy @xmath146 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the intermediate states are located at excitation energies @xmath147 .",
    "one can think of these states as an exciton on top of a collective excitation or , conversely , a collective electronic excitation on top of an exciton @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 in this case may correspond to an absorption peak in the extreme resonance region or well above band gap .",
    "the resonant enhancement of these `` exciton plus plasmon '' states can be due , again , to big numerators or small denominators in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . relatively small @xmath10",
    "could be related to the collective nature of these states or to the relative isolation from neighboring levels .    to illustrate the effect of resonant enhancement of raman peaks , we show in fig . [ fig11 ] the intensity of the cde peak as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the entire range of variation is shown for completeness , i.e. , below band gap excitation , extreme resonance , and well above band gap excitation . in the extreme resonance case ,",
    "the enhancement is related to absorption maxima as mentioned above . on the other hand , for @xmath7 well above band gap",
    ", we pick up an intermediate state with energy @xmath148 , where the exciton level @xmath62 corresponds to the absorption maximum at 1620 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8]a ) , and @xmath149 mev is the energy of the charge monopolar collective state . for this state , we chose @xmath150 mev .",
    "the effect is an enhancement of the intensity around 1642 mev , as shown in the figure , that according to ref .",
    "is an outgoing resonance .",
    "this calculation reveals that the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath151 may dictate the qualitative features of raman scattering with well above band gap excitation .",
    "a consistent treatment in which the @xmath10 are computed for each @xmath14 is left for future study .",
    "this theoretical investigation of the role of resonance excitation in electronic raman scattering from qdots has revealed many hitherto unsuspected features and details . in general terms , the raman intensities of the spes , cdes , and sdes are strongly affected when the incident light energy is swept from below , through , and above the quantum dot band gap .",
    "incoming resonances produce a rapid variation in intensity for excitation energies just above the band gap , and outgoing resonances are predicted for higher excitation energies , as observed experimentally .",
    "in fact , observation of the raman intensity of just one spe , for example , as a function of the incident light energy can provide precise details of the optical absorption spectrum and density of states .",
    "the role of damping in the intermediate states has been shown to be a significant factor in determining these resonances and deserves further theoretical analysis .",
    "another aspect of this work is the unravelling of the complexity of features in polarized raman spectroscopy of qdots .",
    "this spectral complexity in dots with large numbers of electrons has been evident from the first experiments .",
    "these calculations have shown what excitations dominate in which polarizations and point the way to a better control of what is measured in future experiments .",
    "experimentally , the predicted selective resonances have advantages and disadvantages . by employing resonance excitation ,",
    "a particular final state can be enhanced over its companions and thus make it easier to identify . on the other hand ,",
    "the rapid variation in intensity of the individual and numerous spes makes it difficult to uniquely identify them . in this regard ,",
    "the fine structure evident for spes from these calculations should be explored by performing high resolution raman spectroscopy in future .",
    "the best situation for evaluating the spes would be for an excitation energy about 30 mev below the band gap , where some overall resonance enhancement occurs but the contribution from band gap photoluminescence would be weak .",
