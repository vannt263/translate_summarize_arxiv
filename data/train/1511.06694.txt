    "obtaining one - loop divergences is a typical calculational problem in quantum field theory . a standard method to solve",
    "it is to construct all divergent diagrams and to calculate them .",
    "however , this can lead to certain difficulties in some cases . for example , if the calculations are made in the curved space , a number of divergent diagrams is infinite in the case of constructing the perturbation theory on the flat background .",
    "nevertheless , writing the result in the covariant form allows to find a sum of all divergent contributions in this case .",
    "the covariant result can be constructed , for example , by using the calculations in the weak field limit in which the deviation of the metric from the flat one is considered to be small or by some other methods . however , the calculations can be considerably simplified if some operations are made in the general case .",
    "this is done , for example , within the method for calculating one - loop divergences proposed by g.thooft and m.veltman @xcite , by which the one - loop divergences was first calculated for gravity .",
    "the essence of this method is that if the second variation of the action ( which determines the one - loop divergences ) is the minimal second order operator , then it is possible to construct a covariant equation relating one - loop divergences to the coefficients of this operator .",
    "then it is not already necessary to restore a covariant result from the weak field expansion in each particular case .",
    "the thooft  veltman method allows to considerably simplify calculations of the one - loop divergences and to find easily their signs and coefficients .",
    "the main shortcoming of this method is strong limitations on a form of the second variation of the action . using various techniques some generalizations of this method",
    "were constructed . in particular , the thooft  veltman formula has been generalized to the case of an arbitrary differential operator @xcite .",
    "although the result appeared to be very large , it has been applied for making some one - loop calculations @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the obtained general formula allows to simplify automatization of the calculations , if the software for treating tensors ( e.g. , @xcite ) is used .    from the mathematical point of view the thooft  veltman method corresponds to calculating the minakshisundaram ",
    "de - witt coefficient @xcite @xmath2 for a differential operator coinciding with the second variation of the action . in four dimensions",
    "this coefficient is related to one - loop logarithmic divergences . in the general case , in the space of the dimension",
    "@xmath3 the one - loop logarithmic divergences are related to the coefficient @xmath4 .    for various differential operators the minakshisundaram ",
    "de - witt coefficients can be calculated using the schwinger ",
    "de - witt technique and its generalizations @xcite .",
    "however , this technique does not allow to obtain a result for an arbitrary differential operator .",
    "from the other side , the total derivative terms were not found in ref .",
    "( their contributions to the one - loop divergences are integrals of total derivatives . ) therefore , there is a problem how the results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized in order to take into account total derivative terms .",
    "these contributions are essential in some cases , for example , if the calculations are made on the ( anti ) de - sitter background .",
    "let us note that the calculations on the ( anti ) de - sitter background are usually made by different methods .",
    "for example , the minakshisundaram  seeley ",
    "de - witt coefficients for the minimal operator can be found in an arbitrary dimension by the harmonic analysis on the homogeneous spaces @xcite . using this method",
    "one - loop divergences were calculated for the fields of an arbitrary spin on the four - dimensional ( anti ) de - sitter background in the minimal gauge @xcite .",
    "a similar calculation , based on the formula for the @xmath2 coefficient of the minimal operator , was made in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we try to understand , how it is possible to calculate total derivatives terms using the thooft  veltman technique for nonminimal operators . for this purpose",
    "we consider the simplest case of the two - dimensional space , in which logarithmic divergences are related to the coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate this coefficient for the second order nonminimal operator taking into consideration the total derivative terms , under the assumption that nonminimal terms are small , but nonvanishing .",
    "then this result is verified by a calculation of one - loop divergences for the higher spin theory in a nonminimal gauge , which depends on two arbitrary ( small ) parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section_b2 ] we describe a method for calculating one - loop divergences which is applicable , if the second variation of the action is a second order nonminimal operator with small nonminimal terms , and present the result of this calculation , which is given by eq .",

    "<S> a simple formula for one - loop logarithmic divergences on the background of a two - dimensional curved space - time is derived for theories for which the second variation of the action is a nonminimal second order operator with small nonminimal terms . in particular , this formula allows to calculate terms which are integrals of total derivatives . as an application of the result , </S>",
    "<S> one - loop divergences for the higher spin fields on the constant curvature background are obtained in a nonminimal gauge , which depends on two parameters . by an explicit calculation </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that with the considered accuracy the result is gauge independent . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the result appeared to be independent of the spin @xmath0 for @xmath1 .    </S>",
