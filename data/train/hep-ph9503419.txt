    "<S> while emc - smc - e142 data sheds new light on the behavior of polarized parton distributions at small and intermediate @xmath0 , it may be also interesting to study valence quark polarizations at large @xmath0 , where spectator quark counting rules and carlitz - kaur type models predict different behavior for down quark polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the article examines the possibility of testing the ratio @xmath1 at @xmath2 in the inclusive production of @xmath3-bosons .    in the last years </S>",
    "<S> much attention of hep community is attracted to the physics of polarized hadron interactions , to great extent due to the recent interesting data on polarized inclusive  @xcite and semi - inclusive  @xcite deep - inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the emc - smc - e142 data already allow to make several conclusions about the nucleon spin structure at @xmath4 and values of bjorken @xmath5 . the analysis of these data in the framework of perturbative qcd provides information on longitudinal polarized parton distributions @xmath6 , interpreted as the differences of probabilities @xmath7 for finding partons of the type @xmath8 with spin parallel / antiparallel to the spin of the parent nucleon </S>",
    "<S> . however in the region of @xmath9 the experimental errors have a tendency to grow , while at @xmath10 there is still no data at all . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , precise studies of various polarized processes at large @xmath0 may provide valuable information about the behavior of longitudinal valence quark polarizations @xmath11 , that are dominant in this region compared to sea quarks and gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> so far the common opinion on how the polarized quark distributions @xmath12 and @xmath13 should behave at large @xmath0 is not fully established . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental information in this region is not precise enough to fix @xmath14 s unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical description is also not unique . </S>",
    "<S> this problem was examined as far as in mid-70 s , but not solved to the end . since that time the majority of theoretical models , describing valence quarks at @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> falls into two general categories .    </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative analysis of the distinctions between these two approaches can be based on the representation of a nucleon as composed from the valence quark carrying a large portion of nucleon s momentum , and a diquark with @xmath16  @xcite ; in good approximation the contribution of the sea may be neglected . the experimental results ( for example , the behavior of the ratio of nucleon structure functions @xmath17 at @xmath2 ) convincingly indicate that the @xmath18-symmetry of the nucleon wavefunction is violated , so that the states containing diquarks with certain spin - isospin numbers @xmath19 are suppressed compared to the situation of the exact @xmath18-symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the models of the first type follow the works of carlitz and kaur  @xcite and assume that diquarks in this region must be in a @xmath20 rather than in a @xmath21 state . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the models motivated by perturbative qcd start from the assumption that only diquarks in a @xmath22 state are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> one of the pioneering works in the framework of the second approach was published by farrar and jackson  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the different mechanism of @xmath18-breaking in these two approaches leads to different predictions for several quantities measured both in unpolarized and polarized reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the most known of them is the ratio @xmath17 , which tends in these models correspondingly to @xmath23 or @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> most part of the existing data on the structure functions @xmath25 at large @xmath0 evidences in favor of @xmath23 value , providing that perturbative - qcd result is not valid . as for the polarized nucleon interactions , </S>",
    "<S> so far no experiment , allowing to discriminate one model from another , was staged on the existing colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> such an experiment can be based on the fact that carlitz - kaur ( ck ) and farrar - jackson ( fj ) models disagree about the behavior of valence @xmath26-quark polarizations at large @xmath0 . while in ck model </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 , the fj approach predicts that @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the information about the limiting behavior of @xmath29 may be obtained in various experiments , for instance , deep - inelastic scattering ; however , it may also be interesting to carry out a straightforward measurement of the ratio @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> if at least one polarized proton beam is available , one can measure longitudinal single - spin asymmetries @xmath30 in the inclusive production of @xmath31-bosons @xmath32 or @xmath33 ; in the appropriate kinematical range these asymmetries will be directly proportional to the ratio @xmath34  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is not necessary to measure @xmath3-asymmetries in the region of @xmath0 very close to 1 . the behavior of @xmath13 in ck and fj models should be very different already at @xmath35 , where the cross - sections are still noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is dedicated to the discussion of the opportunity to study polarized valence distributions in @xmath3-boson production , especially to the explicit evaluation of the kinematical region , where the event rates will be high enough to make definite conclusions about the magnitude of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> but , to begin , let us briefly review the description of valence quark distributions in ck and fj models .    since the behavior of parton distributions </S>",
    "<S> is determined by the properties of hadrons at large distances , where the running coupling of quark - gluon interactions is not small , the perturbative qcd arguments are not directly relevant to their analysis at arbitrary values of bjorken @xmath0 . however </S>",
    "<S> , the situation when the struck parton carries almost all of the nucleon s momentum corresponds to very far off - shell configuration of nucleon constituents  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a configuration can be obtained from the nucleon state with the lowest orbital momentum and the finite invariant masses of partons only by exchange of hard gluons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution to the amplitude of deep - inelastic scattering is provided by feynman graphs with minimal number of gluon propagators tying quarks into a single hadron .    </S>",
    "<S> the straightforward calculation of these graphs shows that the falloff of helicity - dependent quark distributions is described by the power - law dependence , @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 is the minimal number of spectator quarks and @xmath39 for @xmath40 or 1 for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the slowest falloff corresponds to the valence quark distributions , for which @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the essential feature of ( [ power ] ) is that the power - law falloff does not depend on the flavor of quarks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the perturbative result prescribes the distributions of valence up and down quarks to be proportional in the limit @xmath2 , and the coefficient of proportionality can be found to be @xmath43  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also implies that , independently of quark flavor , the helicity of a quark with @xmath2 must match the helicity of the parent hadron , so that @xmath44 should approach @xmath45 . for valence @xmath26-quarks this means that @xmath13 , which is negative at small and intermediate @xmath0 , the negative @xmath13 was anticipated from theoretical considerations , especially from the sign of its first moment @xmath46 ; these anticipations were recently confirmed by the experimental values of @xmath13 , derived from the analysis of nucleon and deuteron dis data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] , must change sign at some @xmath0 , typically chosen to be around @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to mention that equation ( [ power ] ) provides only upper limit for the magnitudes of quark distributions , which is achieved only if there are no other sources of suppression . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , there is strong experimental evidence that at large @xmath0 @xmath26-quarks are suppressed compared to @xmath48-quarks . in particular , most part of the experimental information about the ratio of nucleon structure functions @xmath17 , including the most recent nmc data  @xcite , shows that it falls lower than the limiting value @xmath24 predicted by perturbative - qcd based approach . </S>",
    "<S> the fit of the overall world data on @xmath49 , presented in @xcite , tends to @xmath23 , which is the limiting value for this ratio when @xmath50 falls faster than @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> such a suppression of valence @xmath26-quarks is an essential feature of another model , proposed by carlitz and kaur  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the valence distributions in this approach are built using simple quark model considerations , especially the assumption that all diquarks with @xmath52 are suppressed relative to those with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath53 , obtained in fj model , should not hold in ck approach , and valence quark distributions can be easily accommodated to satisfy the tendency of @xmath49 to @xmath23 . just as in fj model </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath54 as @xmath2 , but the behavior of valence @xmath26-quarks is different and @xmath55 . for typical parameterizations of carlitz - kaur cosines , describing dilution of the valence quark spin in the parton sea and quickly approaching @xmath56 at intermediate and large @xmath0 , @xmath57 is close to its limiting value already at @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the latter distinction between fj and ck models ( the retention of valence @xmath26-quark helicity in the first case and @xmath26-quark negative polarization of @xmath59 in the second ) may serve as a basis for one more experimental test of proton inner structure . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive production of @xmath31-bosons in @xmath60- or @xmath61-collisions is very suitable for the investigation of this distinction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since parity is not conserved in weak interactions , only one polarized initial beam is necessary to get nonzero cross - section asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one opportunity for this experiment may arise if a polarized proton beam will be put into operation at tevatron </S>",
    "<S> . it will be also possible to investigate @xmath31-boson asymmetries in proton - proton interactions at bnl - rhic collider .    on the parton level the leading contribution to @xmath31-production </S>",
    "<S> is provided by the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of born contribution at small and intermediate values of @xmath31-boson rapidities @xmath63 has already been carried out in  @xcite ; however , in this paper i would like to discuss polarized @xmath31-production at large @xmath63 , where the cross - sections quickly fall down , and estimate possible errors of the asymmetry measurement . also , to get reliable estimates of @xmath64-boson cross - sections , one has to consider higher - order contributions ; the discussion of them will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    for the reaction @xmath65 the cross - section @xmath66 and </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding single - spin asymmetry @xmath30 are written as  @xcite @xmath67 and @xmath68 here @xmath69 and @xmath63 are the mass and rapidity of @xmath3-boson , @xmath70 is the fermi constant and @xmath71    the @xmath61 cross - section @xmath72 and asymmetry @xmath30 can be obtained from ( [ cross],[asym ] ) by substituting @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspondingly for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that when @xmath63 tends to upper kinematical bound , @xmath77 , @xmath30 is directly proportional to @xmath78 at @xmath79 . in this limit the other bjorken variable , @xmath80 is of the order @xmath81 for rhic and 0.002 for tevatron . for such @xmath80 s valence </S>",
    "<S> quarks become less important compared to the sea , and therefore @xmath82 , @xmath83 . in its turn , this means that @xmath60 and @xmath61 cross - sections , measured at same @xmath84 , at large @xmath63 should be described by approximately the same dependence . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown by numerical results , the cross - sections for typical rhic energies , assumed to be @xmath85 , in the region of most interest are smaller than tevatron ones , calculated for @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 and 2 show unpolarized cross - sections @xmath66 , @xmath72 and corresponding asymmetries @xmath30 as functions of @xmath87 , varying in the interval @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these values of @xmath87 correspond to @xmath31-boson rapidities @xmath89 for rhic and @xmath90 for tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections were calculated using gl \" uck - reya - vogt unpolarized distributions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> 3.5 in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> differential cross - sections of inclusive @xmath3-boson production in @xmath60-collisions at rhic ( @xmath91 dash line ) and in @xmath61-collisions at tevatron ( @xmath92 solid line ) .    </S>",

    "<S> long dash and dot - dash lines : asymmetries @xmath30 in @xmath60- and @xmath93-channels for ck - type distributions  @xcite    as can be seen from fig.1 , both @xmath60- and @xmath61-cross - sections quickly fall down with the increase of @xmath87 , @xmath66 being smaller than @xmath94 . typical values of cross - sections at @xmath95 and @xmath96 are @xmath97 and @xmath98 in @xmath60-channel , @xmath99 and @xmath100 in @xmath61-channel . knowing these cross - sections , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to estimate the statistical error in determination of asymmetry @xmath30 : @xmath101 here @xmath102 is polarization of the beam and @xmath103 is the number of events , expressed as a product of the corresponding cross - section , beam luminosity @xmath104 , pure running time @xmath105 and combined trigger and reconstruction efficiency @xmath106 . assuming that @xmath107 for rhic and @xmath108 for tevatron , @xmath109 ( about 4 months ) , @xmath110 and @xmath111 it is easy to obtain that @xmath112 for rhic and @xmath113 for tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the asymmetries @xmath30 in @xmath60- and @xmath61-channels both for ck and fj - type polarized distributions , represented correspondingly by set 1 distributions from  @xcite and by recently proposed brodsky - burkardt - schmidt ( bbs ) distributions from  @xcite is not suppressed and behaves like @xmath114 ; this leads to larger unpolarized cross - sections of @xmath3-production compared to those obtained with standard unpolarized distributions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the conclusions about @xmath30 are influenced only slightly , since @xmath30 practically depends only on the ratio @xmath1 . ] . as expected from the above discussion , already at intermediate @xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> it can be seen that even if the zero point is located at larger @xmath0 , e.g. @xmath116 , the precision of the experiment still allows to reliably discriminate one model from another .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> though the problem of the description of helicity - dependent down quark distributions at large @xmath0 is very old and well - known , no direct experimental test of @xmath13 at @xmath2 has been done yet . </S>",
