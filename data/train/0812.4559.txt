    "lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies were originally conceived as a morphological transition class between ellipticals and early - type spirals by hubble ( 1936 ) .",
    "these galaxies have disks spanning a wide range in luminosity , contributing between five to fifty percent of the total galaxy light .",
    "they are distinguished from spiral galaxies by the lack of conspicuous spiral arms .",
    "for these reasons , lenticulars can be thought of as a population which is intermediate between ellipticals and early type spirals .",
    "indeed , the placement of lenticulars by hubble ( 1936 ) on the tuning fork diagram clearly implies such a relationship . in several observable properties such as bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio , star formation rate and colour , lenticulars are , on average , intermediate between ellipticals and early type spirals .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes .",
    "a and b are the coefficients of @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , c is the constant , n is the number of galaxies , @xmath5 is the r.m.s .",
    "scatter measured along the @xmath6 axis and @xmath7 is the r.m.s .",
    "scatter measured in a direction orthogonal to the best - fit photometric plane .",
    "barway  ( 2007 ) have presented evidence to support the view that the formation history of lenticular galaxies depends upon their luminosity . according to this view",
    ", low - luminosity lenticular galaxies likely formed by the stripping of gas from the disk of late - type spiral galaxies , which in turn formed their bulges through secular evolution processes . on the other hand , more luminous lenticulars likely formed at early epochs through a rapid collapse followed by rapid star formation .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the bam06 galaxies complement our sample in two ways : they extend to fainter luminosities and provide lenticulars in different environments . in figure",
    "[ f1 ] we show the distribution of total absolute magnitude ( @xmath8 ) in the @xmath0 band for the combined sample , which is seen to span a wide range in luminosity . we divide the combined sample into faint and bright groups , using @xmath9 as a boundary .",
    "the bright sample has 37 lenticulars while 46 lenticulars belong to the faint sample according to this luminosity division .",
    "the boundary at @xmath10 is somewhat arbitrary but our results do not critically depend on small shifts in the dividing luminosity .",
    "for instance , changing this value by half a magnitude on either side maintains correlations significant at least at the 95% level .    using the luminosity division at @xmath10 , barway  ( 2007 ) reported markedly different correlations between bulge effective radius ( @xmath11 ) and disk scale length ( @xmath12 ) for bright and faint lenticulars .",
    "a positive correlation of bulge and disk sizes is expected if the bulge grows over time through secular evolution processes ( see review by kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "no such correlation is expected if the bulge formed via merger related processes .",
    "barway  ( 2007 ) found this positive correlation between bulge and disk sizes of low luminosity lenticulars ; such a correlation was not observed for bright lenticulars .",
    "moreover , they found that the correlation holds for faint galaxies , irrespective of whether they are situated in a field or cluster environment .",
    "if the differences between low and high luminosity lenticulars are indeed fundamental , then there should be systematic differences seen between the two populations in other correlations among bulge and disk parameters .",
    "we study such correlations in the following sections .      for samples of large elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the central surface brightness @xmath13 ( or , equivalently , the mean surface brightness ( @xmath14 ) within @xmath11 ) is correlated with @xmath15 .",
    "this was first reported by kormendy  ( 1977 ) and is known as the kormendy relation . in figure  [ f2](a )",
    "we show the kormendy relation for bright ( as open circles ) and faint lenticulars ( as filled circles ) .",
    "the bright lenticulars show tight correlation with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath16 with significance greater than 99.99 % .",
    "the kormendy relation for faint lenticulars shows considerably greater scatter although the pearson correlation coefficient is @xmath17 with significance greater than 99.99 % .",
    "figure  [ f2](b ) show the kormendy relation for bright ( as crosses ) and faint ( as dashes ) lenticulars classified as barred lenticulars in rc3 catalogue to probe for any systematic effect caused due to presence of bars .",
    "it is clear from the figure that barred and non - barred show no systematic offset .",
    "only three galaxies are classified as barred in our bright galaxy sample ( indicated by crosses ) . even after removing these three galaxies ,",
    "the correlation is nearly unchanged with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath18 with significance greater than 99.99 % . in the faint lenticular sample",
    ", there are as many as 16 galaxies classified as barred .",
    "nevertheless , neglecting these 16 galaxies does not affect the correlation which has @xmath19 with significance greater than 99.99 % .",
    "for all other correlations subsequently reported in this paper , we find that excluding barred galaxies does not significantly alter the correlation coefficient or its significance .",
    "hence , in further discussion , we do not differentiate between barred and non - barred lenticulars , and include both types in the analysis .",
    "the kormendy relation is known to be a projection of the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler 1987 ) of galaxies .",
    "a tight kormendy relation indicates ( near ) virialized bulges like those found in elliptical galaxies . in figure 2a",
    ", ellipticals from the coma cluster are overplotted as dots .",
    "as expected , these ellipticals show a tight correlation with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath20 with significance greater than 99.99 % .",
    "the slopes of the best - fit kormendy relation for bright lenticulars and coma ellipticals are similar .",
    "this similarity coupled with the systematic difference in scatter in the kormendy relation between bright and faint lenticulars is an indicator of the more virialized state of the bright lenticular bulges and their close relation to ellipticals .",
    "analogous to the fundamental plane ( fp ) , ellipticals and the bulges of early type spiral galaxies obey a single planar relation of the form @xmath21 which khosroshahi ( 2000a , b ) called the photometric plane ( pp ) .",
    "assuming that galaxy bulges behave as spherical , isotropic , one - component systems , there is a unique specific entropy that can be associated with every galaxy ( lima - neto 1999 ) .",
    "this in turn , implies a relation between bulge parameters that is equivalent to the observed photometric plane .",
    "an edge - on view of the best - fit pp is shown in the top and bottom panels of figure  [ f3 ] for bright and faint lenticulars respectively .",
    "table 2 lists the coefficients for best - fit pp relation .",
    "it is immediately evident from figure  [ f3 ] that the pp for faint lenticulars spans a limited range of @xmath22 .",
    "we restrict our bright lenticular sample to the range spanned by the faint lenticulars and then obtain the best fit pp for this restricted sample .",
    "the rms scatter for the ( restricted ) bright galaxies is considerably smaller than that for the faint galaxies ( see table 2 ) . in figure  [ f4 ]",
    "we show the pp for these two sets of galaxies . visually , the higher scatter of the faint galaxies about the pp is obvious .",
    "the pp is a natural state for galaxies that formed like ellipticals ( at early epochs in a burst of rapid star formation , with stellar orbits that are well relaxed ) .",
    "the fact that bulges of bright lenticulars have a tight pp is an indicator of homology with ellipticals .",
    "faint lenticulars seem to belong to a separate class .",
    "the restricted range spanned by the srsic index in faint lenticular galaxies also affects other correlations involving this index .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] is a plot of the srsic index ( @xmath22 ) as a function of effective radius ( @xmath11 ) which again shows systematic differences between bright and faint lenticulars .",
    "bright lenticulars are well correlated having pearson correlation coefficient @xmath23 with significance greater than 99.99 % but faint lenticulars do not show a significant correlation .",
    "a strong correlation exists between @xmath22 and the bulge central surface brightness ( @xmath13 ) , as shown in figure  [ f6 ] for the brighter lenticulars .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient in this case is 0.84 at a significance level better than 99.99% .",
    "faint lenticulars also exhibit good correlation having pearson correlation coefficient @xmath24 at significance 99.96 % , but have a markedly different slope . comparing figure  [ f5 ] and",
    "figure  [ f6 ] with figure 3 and figure 4 respectively of khosroshahi ( 2000b ) , we observe a close correspondence in the distribution of the bulges of _ bright _ lenticulars and early type spirals .",
    "bulges of early type spirals , in turn , have a close correspondence with ellipticals ( khosroshahi 2000b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "faint lenticulars seem to be a different population .",
    "the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio ( @xmath25 ) increases with srsic index @xmath22 as shown in figure  [ f7 ] for brighter lenticulars ( @xmath26 with significance greater than 99.99 % ) .",
    "faint lenticulars show a weak correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "again , the trends for bright lenticulars are consistent with those found by khosroshahi ( 2000b ) in early - type spirals .",
    "bright lenticulars plotted in figure 3 of barway ( 2007 ) include 5 galaxies that are obvious outliers in the anti - correlation of bulge and disk sizes .",
    "these bright lenticulars viz .",
    "ugc80 , ugc2187 , ugc3536 , ugc7473 and ugc11356 do follow the correlations involving the srsic index .",
    "however , they are all characterised by a low srsic index , low bulge central surface brightness , low bulge effective radius and low bulge - to - total luminosity ratio .",
    "this places these lenticulars in the bottom left quadrant of figures 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "their bulge / disk parameters indicate that these are disk - like systems , with relatively weak bulges , making them unlikely candidates of major merger induced formation .",
    "nevertheless , they do follow the same correlations , involving the srsic index , as the other bright galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy needs to be explored with a larger sample of bright , but disky lenticulars .",
    "there exist clear correlations between the two main disk parameters central surface brightness of the disks ( @xmath29 ) and disk scale - length ( @xmath12)  for both bright and faint lenticulars ( see figure  [ f8 ] ) although they occupy different regions of the plot .",
    "lenticulars with large disks have a lower central surface brightness , on average .",
    "a clear anti - correlation is seen between these two disk parameters for bright lenticulars but the scatter is large .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient between @xmath29  and log @xmath12 is 0.43 with a significance of 99.37 percent .",
    "faint lenticulars show less scatter with the correlation coefficient of 0.70 at a significance level better than 99.99 % .",
    "similar statistically significant correlation was reported by khosroshahi ( 2000b ) for early - type spirals and mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) for late - type spirals for these disk parameters . in figure",
    "[ f8 ] , we also plot as dots the central surface brightness of the disks ( @xmath29 ) against the disk scale length ( @xmath12 ) of galaxies from the @xmath0 band observations of khosroshahi ( 2000b ) of early - type spirals . from the plot",
    "it is apparent that the disk scale lengths of our sample and the khosroshahi ( 2000b ) sample span the same range , but @xmath29 are brighter , on the average , for early - type spirals than faint lenticulars .",
    "the dependence of cluster environment on formation and evolution of galaxies is well known .",
    "the environment influence is best visible through the well - known morphology - density relationship , according to which early - type galaxies are preferentially found in rich environments ( dressler 1980 ) , with spirals are found predominately in low density environments .",
    "one of the stronger trends seen in the morphology - density relation at low redshift is the dramatic increase in the number of lenticular galaxies in rich clusters ( dressler 1997 ) , suggesting that the dominant process in defining the morphology - density relation is the transformation of spiral galaxies into lenticular galaxies within rich clusters ( poggianti 1999 ; kodama & smail 2001 ) .",
    "these spiral galaxies are continuously supplied by accretion from the surrounding field during the course of the assembly of the cluster .",
    "_ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ imaging of 10 clusters at higher redshift ( z @xmath300.3 - 0.5 ) by dressler 1997 shows similar behaviour .",
    "the mechanisms proposed for morphological transformation of spirals to lenticulars include dynamical interactions such as galaxy harassment ( moore 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) and gas dynamical processes e.g. ram pressure stripping ( abadi 1999 ) .",
    "simulations have shown that galaxy harassment is a very efficient mechanism for transforming early - type disk galaxies to lenticulars ( moore 1999 ) with consequent reduction in disk sizes .",
    "ram pressure stripping truncates the star formation by removing the cold neutral gas reservoir causing the disk component of a spiral galaxy to fade within the cluster environment .    to address these possibilities observationally ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate how scaling relations defined by various galaxy properties vary between field and cluster environments . in this section ,",
    "we examine a few correlations as a function of environment .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to include bright lenticulars in this comparison because only 3 cluster galaxies out of the 38 in our sample , are bright . for faint galaxies ,",
    "the number of galaxies in the field and in clusters are almost equal , making a comparison possible .",
    "the kormendy relation for faint lenticulars plotted in figure  [ f2 ] shows two distinct groups , unlike bright lenticulars . to investigate the origin of this dichotomy in the faint lenticulars , we plot the kormendy relation for faint lenticulars , differentiating them by environment , in figure  [ f9 ] .",
    "we indicate field lenticulars with open triangles and cluster lenticulars with filled squares .",
    "the field lenticulars seem to follow the kormendy relation reasonably well while the cluster lenticulars show a clear downward scatter with respect to the relation . on average",
    ", this requires a 1.5 mag arcsec@xmath31 fading of the mean surface brightness within @xmath11 of faint cluster lenticulars , with respect to the kormendy relation .",
    "boselli & gavazzi ( 2006 ) have suggested that low - luminosity lenticulars in clusters might be the result of ram pressure stripping of late - type galaxies , which causes fading and thus lowers surface brightness .",
    "it is interesting to see if this fading is also seen for the disk component . in figure",
    "[ f10 ] , we plot the disk central surface brightness against the disk scale length . as above , we indicate faint field and cluster lenticulars with different symbols .",
    "the faint field lenticulars exhibit a clear anti - correlation , whereas the cluster lenticulars occupy a limited region of the plot and show a downward scatter ( indicating fading of the disk ) , very similar to the scatter seen in figure  [ f9 ] .",
    "our results obtained using only photometric data are consistent with the spectroscopic results of barr ( 2007 ) , which support the theory that lenticular galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed ( from both bulge and disk ) , possibly when well formed spirals fall into the cluster .",
    "it must be noted that the sample of barr ( 2007 ) is a subset of the bam06 sample , which is included in our analysis .",
    "if lenticulars in clusters are indeed transformed spirals , it is likely that they preserve other signatures of their earlier existence .",
    "for instance , if they contained pseudobulges that formed through secular evolution , their bulge and disk sizes should be correlated ( courteau 1996 ) . in figure",
    "[ f11 ] , we plot the bulge effective radius against the disk scale length for faint lenticulars ( a similar plot for bright lenticulars may be found in barway ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "faint field and cluster lenticulars seems to both follow the same correlation , but inhabit different regions of the plot .",
    "we also overplot data for a sample of late - type disk galaxies from mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) .",
    "the correlation for faint lenticulars and late type spirals has similar slopes ( @xmath32 ) but different intercept which is expected as late - type spirals have larger disk scale length compared to faint lenticulars .",
    "this is a natural expectation if late - type spirals are transforming into faint lenticulars due to interaction with the cluster medium as well as with other galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the main results of this paper are : several correlations such as the kormendy relation , photometric plane etc .",
    "support the hypothesis that bright and faint lenticulars ( in cluster or field environments ) are fundamentally different , with different formation histories .",
    "bright lenticulars resemble ellipticals and bulges of early - type spirals suggesting that they may have formed like them - at early epochs via major mergers or rapid collapse .",
    "faint lenticulars , on the other hand , have properties consistent with them having formed via internal secular evolution processes ( in the field ) or via environment influenced secular evolution processes such as minor mergers , ram pressure stripping and galaxy harassment ( in clusters ) .",
    "although the dominant differentiating parameter between the two lenticular classes is luminosity , the environment also seems to play a role in determining the details of lenticular formation . in particular",
    ", the cluster environment seems to induce a fading of the bulge and the disk and possible transformation in morphology from spiral to lenticular , at least for the faint lenticular population .",
    "if the formation scenario of bright and faint lenticulars is indeed completely different , it should also manifest as differences in star formation history .",
    "these differences can be probed using a combination of population synthesis models and multiband bulge disk decompositions .",
    "we intend to carry out such an analysis in a future project .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for insightful comments that improved the content and presentation of this paper .",
    "we thank a. g. bedregal and a. aragn - salamanca for providing us their bulge - disk decomposition results in electronic form .",
