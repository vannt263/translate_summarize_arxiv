    "we propose and analyze the nitsche method as a simple domain decomposition method for the solution of hypersingular boundary integral equations . in this context ,",
    "simple means that ( i ) its implementation is not more difficult than a conforming approach and ( ii ) its numerical analysis avoids mathematical difficulties inherent to usual domain decomposition approaches . still ,",
    "a thorough analysis of our method , given in this paper , faces the problem of non - existence of a well - posed continuous counterpart for the discrete formulation .",
    "this is due to the low regularity of the underlying energy space .",
    "main attraction of the nitsche method , apart from its relative simplicity , is that it can maintain ellipticity and symmetry of the original problem .",
    "we study the hypersingular integral equation governing the laplacian in @xmath0 exterior to an open surface , subject to a neumann boundary condition . in principle ,",
    "our domain decomposition approach is applicable to more realistic problems like linear elasticity and acoustics .",
    "nevertheless , whereas a generalization to the helmholtz equation is not difficult ( it is a compact perturbation of the laplace case ) there are major difficulties in case of the operator governing the lam equation .",
    "this remains an open problem .",
    "for the solution of partial differential equations , domain decomposition is a classical strategy .",
    "it is used mainly for parallelization and the solution of linear systems .",
    "a variety of techniques exist , such as alternating schwarz methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest are methods that allow for non - matching meshes at the interface between sub - domains .",
    "they facilitate to a great extent mesh generation for complicated geometries .",
    "the so - called mortar method has been designed for this purpose @xcite .",
    "it consists in introducing an unknown lagrangian multiplier on the interface and adding interface conditions in a weak sense .",
    "for an analysis of the laplacian in two and three space dimensions see @xcite .",
    "this method transforms the original problem into a saddle - point structure , so that any numerical scheme requires a discrete _ inf - sup _ condition , i.e. compatibility between approximation spaces on sub - domains and the interface .",
    "an alternative to the mortar method is nitsche s method , originally published in @xcite , and adapted in @xcite to a domain decomposition framework .",
    "the interface condition is again treated weakly ; not as an additional equation but like a penalization term in the ( discrete ) variational formulation .",
    "other terms are added to the formulation to achieve consistency and ellipticity .",
    "moreover , symmetry can be maintained for symmetric problems . as a result ,",
    "nitsche s method differs from classical penalization methods where consistency is lost @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "main advantages of nitsche s method are that    1 .",
    "no additional unknown is needed on the interface , 2 .",
    "no _ inf - sup _ condition must be satisfied among discrete spaces ( except for the global ones , of course ) , and that 3 .",
    "discrete problems are elliptic and can be symmetric for symmetric problems , so that 4 .   standard linear solvers can be used .",
    "nitsche s method is closely related to the stabilized method of barbosa & hughes @xcite , which also circumvents the _ inf - sup _ compatibility condition that arises when a dirichlet boundary condition is imposed weakly through lagrangian multipliers .",
    "the connection between the two methods is established in @xcite .    in the context of partial differential equations ,",
    "the nitsche method has been applied successfully to a variety of problems such as linear elasticity @xcite , two - phase flows @xcite , and fluid - structure interaction @xcite .    in the context of boundary integral equations and the use of non - matching grids or weakly imposed boundary ( or interface ) conditions , we only know of the results @xcite .",
    "both analyze a setting based on lagrangian multipliers .",
    "the former reference provides the basic results like an integration - by - parts formula for the hypersingular integral operator , and analyzes the implementation of dirichlet boundary conditions in a fractional order sobolev space of order @xmath1 .",
    "the latter reference proposes and analyzes the mortar domain decomposition approach for the hypersingular integral equation .",
    "an extreme case , the use of discontinuous basis functions for hypersingular operators , is studied in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that there are several papers on domain decomposition involving boundary elements , e.g. @xcite where standard boundary elements are used for problems on sub - domains of the pde problem , and @xcite which analyze domain decomposition for boundary elements in the construction of preconditioners .",
    "these papers do not deal with the problem of approximating functions ( of fractional order sobolev spaces ) in a non - conforming way .    in this paper",
    "we propose and analyze a nitsche domain decomposition variant for the hypersingular integral equation governing the laplacian .",
    "although this approach is simpler than mortar strategies in important aspects , as explained before , there are some non - trivial obstacles in its numerical analysis .",
    "energy spaces of hypersingular operators are fractional order sobolev spaces of order @xmath1 .",
    "these spaces form the natural basis for variational formulations . now",
    ", domain decomposition introduces interfaces where discontinuities arise . in the variational",
    "setting , these discontinuities are not well posed , simply because no well - defined trace operator exists . therefore , we analyze the discrete nitsche method without using a corresponding variational formulation .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of strang s second lemma for non - conforming methods .",
    "the difficulty of non - existence of a well - posed trace operator reappears in the analysis of the discrete problem .",
    "we deal with this problem by making use of a whole scale of sobolev spaces ( of higher regularity than @xmath1 ) and by using inverse properties of discrete functions .",
    "the result is an almost quasi - optimal error estimate for the nitsche method . here ,",
    "`` almost '' refers to perturbations which are only logarithmic in the mesh size .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_model ]",
    "we define some sobolev spaces and our model problem .",
    "we also briefly recall the standard boundary element approximation .",
    "in  [ sec_discrete ] we introduce a domain decomposition ( for simplicity only into two sub - domains ; but this generalizes to more sub - domains in a straightforward way ) , the nitsche - based discretization , and present our main result ( theorem  [ thm_error ] ) .",
