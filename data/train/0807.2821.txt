    "after the discovery of low amplitude pulsation for the bright and well - studied cool , magnetic chemically peculiar a ( ap ) star @xmath1crb @xcite , the question arose whether all cool ap stars ( with effective temperatures below @xmath2k ) are rapid oscillators .",
    "this still - unanswered question may be a pivotal point for theoretical modelling and understanding of the driving mechanism in rapidly oscillating ( roap ) stars .",
    "ap stars are characterised by overabundances of sr , cr , si , mn and rare earth elements .",
    "many searches for rapid oscillations in ap stars have been made .",
    "@xcite found that 25 known roap stars that exhibit pulsations photometrically also show rapid radial velocity variations for the corresponding pulsation periods .",
    "however , several ap stars with photometric indices typical for known roap stars were tested photometrically for pulsations by @xcite and found to be stable to high precision ; these stars are called non - oscillating ap stars , or noap stars .    as seen in , e.g. , the astrometric hr - diagram by @xcite ( @xcite , their figure 2 ) for roap and noap stars , the apparent noap stars occupy essentially the same regions as the roap stars .",
    "however , the noap stars appear to be systematically more evolved than the roap stars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical roap instability strip @xcite also predicts pulsations for the more evolved ap stars near the terminal age main sequence , with periods in the range @xmath3min ( see fig.[fig : hrd ] in section  [ sec : params ] below ) .",
    "@xcite was indeed detected in this region of the hr - diagram , oscillating with the predicted frequency 0.79mhz ( the lowest frequency known for the roap stars ) .",
    "another somewhat less - evolved roap star , hd218994 , has been recently discovered with a period of 14.2min , which is typical of many roap stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus hd116114 is still the only case of a luminous roap star near the terminal age main sequence ; it shows extremely low radial velocity pulsation amplitude only for a small number of chemical elements such as europium and lanthanum .",
    "@xcite searched for rapid pulsations among a group of 9 evolved ap stars inside the roap instability strip in the hr - diagram .",
    "surprisingly , they did not detect any in the time - resolved radial velocity measurements for these stars , and showed that @xmath4 of the stars had magnetic field strengths considerably in excess of 2 kg . while more evolved stars are theoretically expected to require relatively stronger magnetic fields to suppress local surface convection and facilitate observable amplitudes of rapid pulsations ( @xcite ) , this study made a good case for the existence of noap stars near the terminal age main sequence .",
    "hd151878a ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is the primary component of the visual binary hd151878 and is separated by 58 from its 1.51mag fainter companion .",
    "@xcite used low resolution , objective prism plates and classified the star as am : , where the colon means that the star is a marginal metallic line star with a difference between its spectral type determined from the caii kline and from the metals lines of less than 5 spectral subclasses .",
    "@xcite classified the star as a6mf0f5 , where the a6 subtype refers to the caii kline , f0 refers to the h spectral type , and f5 refers to the metal line type .",
    "with 9 spectral subclasses difference between the caii kline type and metal line type , this classification indicates a strong classical am star .",
    "am stars are characterised by overabundance of iron - peak elements and underabundance of ca or sc .",
    "importantly , the ca deficiency of the am stars is not a characteristic of the ap stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for a study of 7 roap stars ) , making it unlikely that this star is a magnetic ap star .",
    "no medium or high dispersion spectroscopy has been published for the system prior to our study .",
    "the strmgren indices of hd151878 ( see section  [ sec : params ] ) indicate spectral peculiarity and are consistent with either an am or ap spectral type .",
    "@xcite recently announced the discovery of rapid photometric oscillations in hd151878 with a period of 6min and an amplitude of as much as 22mmag peak - to - peak , making this the highest amplitude roap star known by a significant margin .",
    "the previous highest photometric amplitude observed for a roap star was on the discovery night for hd60435 when a peak - to - peak variation of 16mmag was detected for this star ( @xcite ) .",
    "that star is the most multiperiodic of all roap stars ( @xcite ) and it rarely shows an amplitude this high . for roap stars with a single , or dominant pulsation mode , the highest photometric @xmath0 amplitudes are around 10mmag peak - to - peak in , e.g. , hd99563 ( @xcite ) , hd101065 ( przybylski s star ; @xcite ) and hd83368 ( hr3831 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the announcement by @xcite of high amplitude photometric pulsations in hd151878 was potentially very important for many reasons : ( i ) the photometric amplitude they found is the highest known for any rapidly oscillating a star ; ( ii ) if the star is an am star  as two spectral classifications show  then it would be the first known rapidly oscillating am star ; that would suggest that a strong magnetic field is not required for high overtone pulsation modes in chemically peculiar a stars , which would require a complete rethinking of theoretical models ; ( iii ) if an error had been made in the spectral classification and hd151878 is an ap star , then it would be only the 6th known roap star in the northern hemisphere ; and ( iv ) the revised hipparcos parallax ( @xmath8mas , @xcite ) , along with a spectroscopically estimated effective temperature of 7000k , shows that hd151878 has evolved past the terminal age main sequence ( section[sec : params ] ) .",
    "the most evolved roap star , hd116114 , shows no photometric variability in johnson @xmath0 above 1mmag on 6 nights of observation ( @xcite ) , and has the lowest radial velocity amplitudes known for a roap star .",
    "this supports theoretical expectations ( @xcite ) of systematically lower frequencies and amplitudes for more evolved roap stars ( at fixed magnetic field strength ) .",
    "hd151878 is inconsistent with this , unless it has a stronger field than that of hd116114 ( 6 kg ) , which we show it does not .",
    "because of the importance of such high amplitude pulsation in hd151878 , we obtained the first high resolution spectra of the star to study the star s pulsation characteristics , and to study its physical properties  particularly its spectral peculiarities .",
    "a total of 74 spectra of hd151878 were obtained in 2.55h with the fibre - fed echelle spectrograph ( fies ) at the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on 2008 april 30 ( hjd@xmath9 ) .",
    "the observations were collected by the observatory staff as part of the fasttrack service mode programme of the not .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath10  at a resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "the aperture of the high resolution fibre used is 13 . with the 46-s readout and overhead times of the fast mode of the ccd , and 80-s exposure times , we obtained a sampling rate of 29 spectra h@xmath12 , i.e. 3 measurements per pulsation cycle for the photometric candidate frequency .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the fiestool software supplied by the not .",
    "this package , based on python and pyraf was especially developed for fies and performs all conventional steps of echelle data reduction , including the subtraction of bias frames , modelling and subtraction of scattered light , flatfielding , order extraction , normalisation ( including fringe correction ) and wavelength calibration .",
    "barycentric velocity correction was included in the wavelength calibration .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio of the individual spectra is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and about 350 in the combined spectrum .",
    "a single thar reference spectrum , obtained immediately after the science spectra sequence , was found sufficient to do the doppler shift test .",
    "radial velocity measurements of telluric lines show a wavelength stability to better than 100  over 2.55h , or to the accuracy obtainable from internal stability of telluric lines .",
    "the same stability is found with sharp lines in the stellar spectrum .",
    "relative to @xmath15 telluric lines , the absolute wavelength scale s zero point deviates by only @xmath16 ( start ) to @xmath17  ( end ) over the 2.55-h run .",
    "the stellar spectrum has a mean radial velocity of @xmath18 .",
    "the merged 1-d spectra were normalised relatively to a run master spectrum ( a co- added spectrum with a high signal - to - noise ratio ) , then divided by a detailed spline fit to the master spectrum , followed by a low - detail , low - frequency continuum fit performed to each individual spectrum .",
    "the line density is very high for hd151878 , especially to the blue where there is no continuum , in spite of a sharp lined spectrum .",
    "thus we focused our efforts on normalising the spectra for the @xmath19  region where continuum windows are present and where our velocity and abundance analyses were performed .",
    "the region around the caiik line was additionally normalised by comparison to model spectra .",
    "[ sec : params ] we first estimated the stellar parameters of hd151878 from strmgren photometry compiled by @xcite and from @xcite . from the @xmath1 index alone , @xmath20 , we derived @xmath21k using the @xcite calibration .",

    "were directly compared to the synthetic line profiles to provide a first look at the spectroscopic nature of hd151878 ( sect.[sec : abund ] ) .",
    "_ hipparcos _ obtained 138 measurements of the star that show no variability above 9.6mmag amplitude .",

    "are then predicted for hd151878 s primary , in contrast with the 2.78mhz found by @xcite .",
    "the roap star hd116114 has a 6-kg magnetic field that may be important to sustain its pulsations as it is an evolved main sequence star .",
    "being more evolved , hd151878 is expected to have a similar , or stronger , magnetic field to exhibit observable rapid oscillations .",
    "although strong magnetic fields are not expected in am stars , we used the fies spectra to firmly exclude such a strong field .",
    "the magnetically sensitive line feii6149  line ( see fig.[fig : reg1 ] ) is often used as a diagnostic line for determining the magnetic field modulus @xmath58 from the line splitting of its zeeman components ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . by comparing the averaged fies spectrum to model spectra calculated using synthmag @xcite and rotationally broadened to @xmath59",
    ", it is seen that partial splitting would be visible in feii6149   at 6.4 kg .",
    "already at 5.7 kg , the line shape is very broad with at flat core , highly different from the observed line .",
    "8.5 cm    no magnetically resolved lines were found in the spectrum , and for 21 fe lines with different land factors ( and magnetic sensitivity ) , no clear relation of magnetic broadening with land factor could be detected for a relatively high scatter of @xmath60 kg .",
    "the line broadening was determined by fitting line widths with gaussian profiles .",
    "the observed spectra therefore firmly exclude any field stronger than @xmath61 kg .",
    "we searched for pulsations as periodic doppler shifts in two ways : first by using cross correlations of long stretches of spectral regions , then by measuring centre - of - gravity shifts of individual lines in the spectra . for frequency analyses",
    ", we used a discrete fourier transform programme by @xcite and the period04 @xcite programme . for the run length of 2.55h and sampling interval of 126s",
    ", the frequency resolution is about 0.1mhz and the nyquist frequency 4.0mhz . without simultaneous reference spectra ,",
    "we have little control over spectrograph stability on time scales of about an hour , so we only consider the frequency range @xmath62mhz .",
    "the cross correlation method , using large spectral regions , has been successful for detecting pulsation in roap star candidates and for finding additional frequencies in known roap stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cross correlation amplitudes from correlation of long spectral regions are , though , not directly comparable to those derived from line profile measurements . this is mainly due to the different pulsation amplitudes of different elements in the stratified roap atmospheres , where low amplitude elements such as fe dilute the ` integrated ' doppler shifts .",
    "however , for detecting low amplitude pulsations , the method is very efficient , especially in cases where amplitude and phase is comparable for the most abundant elements .",
    "cross correlations were performed with our hd151878 spectra , using the average spectrum as template . for the line - rich spectral regions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , no variability is seen above 10  ( @xmath65 , see fig.[fig : xcor ] ) in the frequency domain of known roap stars .",
    "the wavelength region @xmath66  has a lower line density and a higher scatter , but excludes variability above 20  ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the spectral region @xmath68  with abundant telluric lines was used to check the instrumental stability and identify non - stellar periodicities .",

    "amplitudes vary for different elements and range from a few dozen metres per second up to a few kilometres per second for various roap stars @xcite .",
    "also , the narrow line core of the h@xmath72 profile ( see fig.[fig : ha ] ) shows rapid pulsations in roap stars @xcite .",
    "we therefore searched for pulsations in hd151878 using such lines and show amplitude spectra of a subset of these in fig.[fig : cog ] .",

    "another important property is that the abundances of the first two ionised states of neodymium and praseodymium show more than 1dex difference , with the doubly ionised ions , which form higher in the atmosphere , giving the highest abundance @xcite .",

    "this star was inside the diaphragm of the photometric observations of @xcite , but to cause a 22mmag change in the combined light , the much fainter secondary would have to pulsate with an amplitude of 100mmag .",

    "we therefore suggest that the signal published for hd151878 is instrumental in origin .",

    "<S> recently , @xcite detected the bright component of the visual binary hd151878 to exhibit rapid photometric oscillations through a johnson @xmath0 filter with a period of 6min ( 2.78mhz ) and a high , modulated amplitude up to 22mmag peak - to - peak , making this star by far the highest amplitude roap star known . as a new roap star , </S>",
    "<S> hd151878 is of additional particular interest as a scarce example of the class in the northern sky , and only the second known case of an evolved roap star  </S>",
    "<S> the other being hd116114 . </S>",
    "<S> we used the _ fies _ spectrograph at the nordic optical telescope to obtain high time resolution spectra at high dispersion to attempt to verify the rapid oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that the star at this epoch is spectroscopically stable to rapid oscillations of no more than a few tens of . </S>",
    "<S> the high - resolution spectra furthermore show the star to be of type am rather than ap and we show the star lacks most of the known characteristics for rapidly oscillating ap stars . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this is an am star that does not pulsate with a 6-min period . </S>",
    "<S> the original discovery of pulsation is likely to be an instrumental artefact .    </S>",
