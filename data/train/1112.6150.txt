    "phase - equivalent transformations ( pets ) of two - body interactions are well - known in quantum scattering theory @xcite .",
    "pets play an important role in the inverse scattering theory giving rise to ambiguities in the derived potentials .",
    "currently , there is intensive research on supersymmetric transformations ( see reviews @xcite ) which are a particular case of pets @xcite associated with removing or adding bound states to the system .",
    "more traditional pets which do not change the on - shell properties of the two - body interaction , i.e. two - body scattering phase shifts and the energies of the two - body discrete spectrum states , but modify the interaction off - shell , were used to study manifestations of off - shell properties of two - nucleon interactions in many - nucleon systems .",
    "for example , a correlation between the nuclear matter binding energy and its equilibrium density ( the so - called coester line ) was studied with phase - equivalent @xmath0 interactions in ref .",
    "pets were used to modify the nucleon - cluster interaction in order to obtain a correct description of the nuclear binding energies in cluster model studies of ref . @xcite .",
    "various versions of the realistic jisp @xmath0 interaction ( jisp6 @xcite and jisp16 @xcite ) were obtained by means of pets applied to the initial istp @xmath0 interaction @xcite obtained in the @xmath4-matrix inverse scattering approach with the aim of improving the description of binding energies of many - nucleon systems .",
    "the interaction jisp16 @xcite provides an accurate description of light nuclei @xcite and was used to predict the binding energy and spectrum of the exotic @xmath5f nucleus @xcite which were confirmed later in the first experimental observation of this isotope @xcite .",
    "we propose here a new type of pet , a deuteron - equivalent transformation ( det - pet ) .",
    "contrary to conventional pets resulting in the modification of bound state and scattering wave functions @xcite , det - pet guarantees that the transformed interaction generates not only the same scattering phase shifts and two - body binding energy ( or , more generally , bound state energies ) but also the same bound state ( deuteron ) wave function as the initial untransformed interaction .",
    "the same method easily generalizes to preserve a set of bound state wave functions .",
    "det - pet has the advantage of preserving the deuteron ground state observables . on the other hand ,",
    "det - pet , as well as any pet , modifies a two - body interaction off - shell , and hence manifests itself in many - body systems .",
    "one may naturally inquire whether pets may lead to a better understanding of the appropriate off - shell behavior for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we note that what is appropriate depends on the adopted theoretical framework for the @xmath0 interaction . since the interaction is not an observable , all approaches ( meson exchange , eft , lattice gauge , inverse scattering , ... ) build in model assumptions ( e. g. , form factors , regulators , cutoffs , ... ) . given those model assumptions ,",
    "there are additional unexplored off - shell freedoms and we will show below how to explore those freedoms with constraints tied to @xmath0 bound state observables .    after introducing the formulas defining det - pet , we apply det - pet to the jisp16 @xmath0 interaction and illustrate various versions of det - pet by respective modifications of scattering wave functions at a few values of the det - pet continuous parameter .",
    "a det - pet manifestation in many - body systems is illustrated by the study of binding energies of @xmath1h and @xmath2he binding energies and their correlation ( the so - called tjon line @xcite ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that when any pet , det - pet in particular , is applied to @xmath0 interaction , the binding energy of a three - body ( or heavier ) system can be restored by additional three - nucleon @xmath6 ( or higher - order ) interaction(s ) .",
    "our initial @xmath1h applications reveal the residual role of the @xmath6 interaction for the ground state energy and how that role changes with the det - pet selected .",
    "similarly , our initial @xmath2he applications reveal the residual roles for the combined @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions on the ground state energy .",
    "given the numerical challenges of treating @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc .",
    ", interactions in many - body applications , it is natural to try to minimize their effects . in this context ,",
    "det - pets are a potentially useful tool in future searches for an @xmath0 interaction consistent with many - body data .",
    "two types of pets are known in scattering theory : local pets @xcite that transform a local potential into another local potential and nonlocal pets @xcite which generate nonlocal potential terms",
    ". the local pets always result in some modification of bound state wave functions @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus the discussion here on nonlocal pets .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath8 describes a relative motion in two - body quantum system .",
    "the state @xmath9 can be expanded in infinite series of @xmath10 states @xmath11 , @xmath12 the states @xmath11 are supposed to form a complete orthonormalized basis , @xmath13 using expansion ( [ expanpsi ] ) we obtain an infinite set of algebraic equations defining the expansion coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the hamiltonian matrix elements .    a hamiltonian @xmath17 phase - equivalent to @xmath18 can be defined through its matrix @xmath19 $ ] in the basis @xmath20 .",

    "it is clear that hamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath27 have identical eigenvalue spectra .",
    "their eigenstates @xmath28 and @xmath9 , differ by a linear combination of a finite number of @xmath29 basis states .",
    "any superposition of a finite number of @xmath29 functions must decrease at large distances .",
    "therefore at positive energy @xmath30 associated with scattering , the oscillating asymptotics of wave functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 at large distances are the same .",

    "the det - pet @xmath87 mixes various @xmath75 wave components of the wave function that is equivalent to modification of the central part of the jisp16 interaction in the @xmath75 wave .",
    "this results in significant changes of the large @xmath75 wave component as is seen in fig .  [ 0s2s1s3s ] .",

    "modifications of the large wave function components are much less pronounced .    we see that det - pet generates essential modifications of scattering wave functions without any change of scattering phase shifts and scattering observables ( cross sections , polarization observables , etc . ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that the deuteron wave function and deuteron observables ( rms radius , quadrupole moment , etc . )",
    "are unaffected by det - pet due to the nature of this transformation .",
    "the alteration of scattering wave functions is an indicator for the variation of the off - shell properties of the interaction arising from det - pet .",
    "the modification of the the @xmath0 interaction off - shell should manifest itself in properties of many - nucleon systems .",

    "next , we extrapolate the sequence of finite basis space results to the infinite basis space limit .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain basis space independent results for binding energies and to evaluate their numerical uncertainties .",
    "ncfc suggests two extrapolation methods : a global extrapolation based on the calculations in four successive basis spaces and five @xmath91 values in a 10 mev interval ( extrapolation a ) , and extrapolation b based on the calculations at various fixed @xmath91 values in three successive basis spaces and defining the most reliable @xmath91 value for the extrapolation .",
    "we present here only the extrapolation  a results based on the ncsm calculations with basis spaces up through @xmath93 . the extrapolations a and b usually provide consistent results @xcite , and we checked this consistency for our results in a number of cases .",
    "the evaluated uncertainties of results for binding energies presented here are less then 10  kev in most cases ; in a few cases , we performed the ncsm calculations up to @xmath94 to obtain the binding energies with uncertainty of about 10  kev .",
    "the binding energies of @xmath1h nucleus @xmath95 and of @xmath2he nucleus @xmath96 were calculated with jisp16 interaction modified by det - pets @xmath87 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 varying angle @xmath47 from @xmath99 through @xmath100 in steps of @xmath101 .",

    "@xcite ) is that these results obtained with different interaction models form nearly a straight line on the plot @xmath104 vs @xmath95 . here",
    "we study the @xmath95@xmath104 correlation using families of @xmath0 potentials generated by various det - pet types from the jisp16 interaction , i.e. , all @xmath0 interactions provide not only algebraically identical @xmath0 phase shifts but also identical deuteron wave functions that should give rise to specific @xmath3 correlations in three- and four - nucleon systems .",

    "we recall here that the @xmath98 det - pet is associated with modification of the tensor component of @xmath0 interaction .",
    "another det - pet modifying the tensor component of the jisp16 @xmath0 interaction , is the det - pet @xmath89 .",
    "this det - pet results in a very different range of @xmath95 and @xmath96 variations ( see table  [ tminmax ] ) .",
    "the det - pet @xmath1h and @xmath2he binding energies are also correlated along a nearly straight line ( see fig .",
    "[ tjon0s1s0d1d ] ) .",

    "however , for smaller binding energies , this det - pet suggests much less bound @xmath2he at the same @xmath1h bindings as provided by modern purely two - nucleon interactions .",
    "the det - pet @xmath87 modifies the central @xmath75-wave component of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "it results in the @xmath1h and @xmath2he binding energy correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ tjon0s2s1s3s ] .",
    "we see that in this case the results do not concentrate as tightly around some straight line .",
    "that is , they are more spread out on the plane .",

    "the tjon curve surrounds many points obtained with various @xmath0 interactions .",

    "we investigated transformations of the jisp16 @xmath0 interaction induced by det - pets mixing oscillator components in various combinations .",
    "one of these det - pets generates modifications of the central component of the @xmath0 interaction , the others modify the tensor @xmath0 interaction component .",

    "det - pets impact the binding energies of many - nucleon systems .",
    "we found that the @xmath1h and @xmath2he binding energies can be significantly changed by det - pets .",

    "we speculate that det - pet can be helpful in the further development of jisp - like @xmath0 interactions .",
    "det - pets can be also used to design an interesting approach to effective interactions . in particular , det - pets can be applied to a modern @xmath0 realistic interaction to reduce their high momentum components ( and hence to improve the convergence of _ ab initio _ calculations ) . at the same time , we are preserving the deuteron wave function and @xmath0 correlations in other partial waves at some energy by using the extension of det - pet to preserve the scattering wave function .",
    "such an effective interaction can be very interesting for many - body nuclear applications .",
    "it is also possible to extend the det - pet concept to @xmath6 interactions .",
    "the corresponding set of transformations would then involve changing the interior part of the @xmath6 wave function in such a manner as to preserve the @xmath6 ground state wave function and to preserve the asymptotic @xmath6 wave function .",
    "this could provide a useful tool to explore the off - shell freedoms available in @xmath6 interactions without requiring repeated fits to the @xmath6 bound state properties .",
