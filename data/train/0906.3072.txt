    "curiosity about the formation of stars and planets is fundamental to mankind .",
    "the hypothesis of planet formation in the protosolar nebula can be traced back to the 18th century . despite good theoretical support for the existence of disks around young stars",
    "@xcite , they were largely ignored for many years because the existing observational data could be explained without reference to disks @xcite .",
    "this situation changed slowly over time , particularly as infrared detectors became sensitive to the warm dust component of circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass - @xcite ) provided an unprecedented amount of data in the near - ir passbands that were used in many important studies , such as the distribution of embedded star forming regions ( sfrs ) , statistical estimates of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and the general distribution of stars in the galaxy .",
    "however in the earliest stages of star formation , the spectral energy distributions are dominated by radiation from circumstellar dust at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , with little at near - ir wavelengths of 2mass .",
    "the launch of the _ spitzer _ space telescope revolutionized the study of star formation .",
    "irac ( infrared array camera - @xcite ) and mips ( multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ - @xcite ) instrument teams and several legacy projects obtained observations of young open clusters and individual young sfrs , including `` from molecular cores to planet - forming cores ( c2d ) '' @xcite , `` formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) '' @xcite , `` taurus - the spitzer map of the taurus molecular clouds '' @xcite , and `` gould s belt - star formation in the solar neighborhood '' @xcite - providing a greatly improved census and characterization of young stars and their disks in a wide range of star - forming environments .    as an example of the breadth of these surveys , the c2d project aimed to survey with irac and mips , five nearby star - forming clouds within a certain reddening boundary , and to produce catalogs and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for yso members over the entire sfr ( i.e. not spatially biased to only the cloud cores ) .",
    "irac and mips instrument teams surveyed relatively distant young open clusters and ob associations under gto programs , e.g. ic 348 @xcite , ngc 2264 @xcite , @xmath1 ori @xcite , cep ob2 @xcite , etc .",
    "many scientific papers have already been published from these projects . amongst them , @xcite studied the ysos in the serpens cloud and found that disks in less evolved stages were more clustered .",
    "@xcite also found a different spatial distribution of class i and ii objects in ngc 1333 .",
    "class i objects in ngc 1333 were located along the filament , while class ii objects were more widely distributed .",
    "recently @xcite studied the disk properties of a specific type of stars - weak - line t tauri stars ( wttss ) .",
    "many investigators have previously derived the overall fraction of primordial disks around ysos in young open clusters and groups @xcite , and tried to determine the lifetime of primordial disks to contrain the planet - building time scale .",
    "although many attempts have been made to determine the effects of massive stars on disk evolution , little evidence has been found .",
    "the core cluster of the mon ob1 association , ngc 2264 , is one of the most studied young open clusters . although the cluster is more distant than the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , ngc 2264 is still relatively nearby and serves as a good prototypical populous , young open cluster ( d @xmath2 760 pc : @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the large number ( about 1000 ) of known pre - main sequence ( pms ) members and nearly zero foreground reddening has attracted many observational studies from radio to x - ray wavelengths . in this section",
    "we will summarize the most relevant studies only ( see @xcite for an extensive review of ngc 2264 ) .",
    "@xcite discovered a strong mid - ir source in ngc 2264 ( irs1 ) .",
    "later , @xcite observed this object with the nasa g. p. kuiper airborne observatory in the far - ir and suggested that it might be a stellar or protostellar object of a moderate mass , @xmath3 5  10 m@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite studied the mon ob1 ( ngc 2264 ) molecular clouds with iras 12 @xmath5 , 25 @xmath5 , 60 @xmath5 and 100 @xmath5 images and found 30 discrete far - ir sources .",
    "they also calculated the spectral index of these sources and found that 18 iras sources were class i objects .",
    "they concluded that star formation is ongoing in ngc 2264 . from the @xmath6 band luminosity function",
    "@xcite estimated the number of cluster members to be 360 @xmath7 130 .",
    "@xcite performed an optical and near - ir survey of the cluster , presenting photometry for over 5600 stars .",
    "they used various disk and mass accretion indicators and derived an inner disk fraction ranging from 21% to 56% depending on which empirical disk indicator was used , and a typical mass accretion rate on the order of 10@xmath8 m@xmath4 yr@xmath9 .",
    "recently , @xcite , using mid - ir images obtained with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , found a dense embedded mini - cluster ( spokes cluster ) around the strong ir source irs2 in ngc 2264 .",
    "they found uniformly spaced protostars in a semi - linear fashion .",
    "based on the fact that the distance between the nearest protostars was of the order of the jeans length , they concluded that this geometry was evidence for thermal fragmentation .",
    "@xcite studied the sed of objects around irs2 and confirmed the youth of these objects .",
    "@xcite published a vast amount of optical photometric data for ngc 2264 . from the surface density distribution of h@xmath10 emission stars",
    ", they identified two dense sfrs ( s mon and cone ) and a halo region surrounding the two sfrs .    in this paper",
    ", we present the overall properties of ngc 2264 in the mid - ir passbands .",
    "the data from this work will be used in a future paper on the initial mass function and young brown dwarf candidates in ngc 2264 .",
    "we will describe the photometry from _",
    "images in  2 . along with the mid - ir photometric data for about 22,000 objects , optical and 2mass counterparts of these mid - ir sources will be identified .",
    "in addition the x - ray and h@xmath10 emission stars in mid - ir color - color ( c - c ) diagrams will be presented in this section .",
    "the classification scheme used in this study is described and compared with previous methods in  3 . the mid - ir color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the optical cmd of stars detected in the mid - ir photometry",
    "will also be presented in this section . in ",
    "4 we will identify two young sub - clusterings including the spokes cluster from the spatial distribution of class i sources and show the fractional distribution of the sed slope of ysos in each sub - clustering .",
    "the fraction of disked stars will be derived in  5 and the effect of massive stars on primordial disks will be examined in  6 . and the disk fraction of below the pms locus ( so - called bms )",
    "stars will be discussed in  7 .",
    "the mid - ir characteristics of several interesting objects are also discussed in this section .",
    "the summary of this work is in  8 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ mapping observations were performed under program i d 37 ( pi : g. fazio ) in 7 @xmath11 11 mosaics .",
    "each pointing was imaged in the high dynamic range mode ( exposure time : 0.4 sec and 10.4 sec ) .",
    "the mapping of ngc 2264 was performed on 2004 march 6 and october 8 , with a different spacecraft position angle at the two epochs .",
    "two iterations each day were made with an offset of about 12 arcseconds .",
    "the observed region is slightly larger than the halo region defined in @xcite .",
    "the aors utilized for these maps were numbers 3956480 , 3956736 , 3956992 , and 3957248 .",
    "mips scanning of ngc 2264 was obtained on 2004 march 16 ( pid 58 ) at the medium scan rate ( exposure time : 3.67 s ) .",
    "fourteen scans of 0.75@xmath12 length , with 160@xmath13 offsets have were used .",
    "the observed area is larger and fully covered the region observed with irac .",
    "the aor utilized for the mips mapping was number 4317184 .",
    "the post - bcd ( basic calibrated and mosaiced ) images were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "the pixel size of the irac post - bcd data is @xmath14 , while that of the mips 24 @xmath5 data is @xmath15 . the data utilized pipeline processing software version s14.0.0 for the irac images and s16.1.0 for the mips 24@xmath5 image .",
    "we have used the iraf version of daophot to derive psf - fitting photometry for stars in the field of ngc 2264 . because _ spitzer _",
    "irac images are undersampled , point spread function ( psf ) fitting yields photometry with relatively poor signal - to - noise . for uncrowded fields with little nebulosity",
    ", aperture photometry would provide photometry with lower noise than psf - fitting photometry for irac data .",
    "however , portions of the ngc 2264 field are crowded or have highly variable and strong nebulosity - or both .",
    "we believe that the psf - fitting photometry provides a more uniform and reliable photometry for the entire set of cluster stars , admittedly at the expense of having more noise than aperture photometry for the stars where the backgrounds are benign and crowding is not an issue . for most stars in the cluster , because we have four independent sets of data , the psf - fitting photometric accuracy is improved by averaging the results from the separate aors .",
    "to minimize the contribution of the spatially varying nebulosity , we used a very small fit radii ( 1.4 pixels ) and then corrected to 3-pixel radii magnitudes using the magnitude differences at the two radii calculated from bright stars free of nebulosity .",
    "the sky background was taken from the annulus between 3 and 7 pixels from the source .",
    "as post - bcd images are calibrated , re - sampled and mosaiced data , the spatial variation inherent in the original bcd images is altered and removed . for this reason we assumed that there is no spatial variation in the psf for post - bcd images , i.e. set the ` varorder ' parameter in daopars to `` 0 '' .",
    "the post - bcd mosaic images are flux calibrated in units of mjy sr@xmath9 .",
    "the photometric zero points to use for the phot module of daophot were calculated using the pixel scale and the flux of a zeroth magnitude star from the irac handbook .",
    "the values used were 17.30 , 16.82 , 16.33 and 15.69 mags for channels 1 through 4 , respectively .",
    "the aperture corrections ( to an aperture = 10 pixels , sky annulus = 10  20 pixels ) applied were -0.127 , -0.130 , -0.145 and -0.228 mags for channels 1 through 4 , respectively .",
    "@xcite gave slightly different aperture corrections for post - bcd images , but the differences are less than 0.015 mag which has a negligible effect on determining physical properties for our stars . as mips 24 @xmath5 images are well sampled data , psf photometry for them is rather straightforward .",
    "we used a 2.4-pixel fit radii and 20@xmath13 ",
    "32@xmath13 for the sky annuli .",
    "the post - bcd images were calibrated in units of mjy sr@xmath9 and was 141.1 @xmath16jy pix@xmath17 for mips 24@xmath5 images .",
    "the photometric zero point for use with phot ( 11.76 mag ) was calculated using the pixel scale and flux of a zeroth magnitude star in the mips handbook ( 7.14 jy ) .",
    "the final 24 @xmath16 m magnitudes [ 24 ] were obtained by applying an aperture correction of -0.52 mag .",
    "it is worth mentioning two points relating to the photometry .",
    "the first concerns the detection and removal of cosmic rays .",
    "because the irac images are undersampled it is very difficult to distinguish cosmic rays from point sources .",
    "we used the fact that we have multiple , independent mosaics of the cluster to eliminate cosmic rays not removed within an individual aor by the mopex mosaicing software .",
    "that is , we created catalogs of all point - like sources for each aor .",
    "when we combined the four catalogs , we rejected all sources only identified in a single aor .",
    "the second point concerns point source photometry in spatially varying nebulosity . in order to help eliminate false point sources that are in fact knots or edges in the nebula",
    ", we created median - subtracted mosaic images .",
    "we visually examined these median - subtracted images for all the point sources in our master catalog that lie within the nebular regions - and deleted all sources that do not appear point - like in the median - subtracted images .",
    "our final photometry was still performed on the original mosaic images , however .",
    "we present the photometric data from four irac bands and the mips 24 @xmath5 band for 21,991 objects in table [ tab_sst ] .",
    "we label the objects in table [ tab_sst ] as sst + the identification number in the first column .",
    "the total number of objects detected from the photometry are 21224 , 18329 , 5113 , 2302 and 506 in the 3.6 @xmath5 , 4.5 @xmath5 , 5.8 @xmath5 , 8.0 @xmath5 and 24 @xmath5 bands , respectively .",
    "the weighted mean values and weighted errors of the magnitude from multiple observations were calculated as in @xcite ( weight = 1 / @xmath18 ) .",
    "the distribution of photometric errors is shown in figure [ figerr ] .",
    "the distribution of photometric errors in [ 24 ] is the typical distribution of errors from psf photometry of well sampled data .",
    "for undersampled data , like the irac or hst / wfpc2 images , the distribution is far different - the photometric errors are no better than 0.1 mag even for bright stars ( see the error distribution of bright stars detected only in the short exposure images in figure [ figvar ] ) . but as 4 epochs of data , with 2 exposure times per epoch are available , there could be a maximum number of eight detections for some objects .",
    "if the magnitudes from all images are consistant , the resulting final error is small . if not , the resulting error will be larger .",
    "such a trend can be seen in figure [ figerr ]  there are many faint stars with small errors .    due to the lower spatial resolution of the mips 24 @xmath5 data , we paid considerable attention to finding the appropriate irac counterparts .",
    "if two or more irac sources were matched as counterparts of a [ 24 ] source ( matching radii = 2.@xmath19 ) , we applied the following rule for the [ 24 ] magnitude .",
    "if neither of them showed any evident irac excess , then the [ 24 ] flux was assigned to the nearest object ( 2 cases out of 18 ) . if only one source showed a certain or probable irac excess ( 9 cases ) , then the [ 24 ] flux was assigned to that ir excess star . for one case , although both objects showed an irac excess , we assigned the mips flux to only one of them because that source was much brighter than the other . in four cases",
    "more than one irac source of similar brightness showed an ir excess .",
    "for such cases we drew a wavelength versus brightness plot , extrapolated to 24 @xmath5 and then determined the brightness difference at 24 @xmath5 .",
    "using this difference and measured [ 24 ] flux , we derived an estimated [ 24 ] mag for each component . in the extrapolation",
    ", we assumed a logarithmic function - like variation for class ii stars and a cubic function - like variation for class i objects .",
    "for these objects we assigned a large error  0.1 mag if the two objects were of similar brightness or 0.3 mag if the brightness difference was large ( see the lowest panel of figure [ figerr ] ) . for 2 cases , because both objects are very faint in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] and not detected in [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] , the [ 24 ] flux was not assigned to either of them .",
    "we compared our data with @xcite and found no counterparts in our data for 50 of their objects .",
    "most of them were detected in only one channel and may therefore be spurious detections such as cosmic ray events . for the objects in common with @xcite , the differences relative to our photometry are + 0.151 @xmath7 0.097 ( n = 50 , 5 excluded ) , + 0.077 @xmath7 0.127 ( n = 50 , 4 excluded ) , + 0.081 @xmath7 0.137 ( n = 42 , 3 excluded ) , + 0.195 @xmath7 0.164 ( n = 32 , 2 excluded ) in [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] , respectively .",
    "the systematic offsets relative to the @xcite data may result from their use of aperture photometry ( or , at least from the fact that we use psf photometry and they use aperture photometry ) .",
    "we also compared our data with independent aperture photometry kindly determed by i. song ( priv .",
    "the difference in [ 3.6 ] is + 0.036 @xmath7 0.024 ( n = 51 , 7 excluded ) .",
    "recently @xcite published photometric data for 445 stars in ngc 2264 .",
    "they published data in fluxes rather than in magnitudes .",
    "we transformed their data to magnitudes using the photometric zero points in the irac handbook ( v3.0 ) .",

    "the differences are relatively large and systematic , but we can not identify the source of the systematic differences . to help determine the source of the differences",
    ", we also calculated and compared the @xmath20-[3.6 ] colors for relatively bright , diskless stars in the ngc 2264 field ( specifically , stars with [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath21 0.2 and [ 3.6 ] @xmath21 13 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath20-[3.6 ] colors of our data was + 0.170 @xmath7 0.104 ( n = 183 ) , while that of @xcite was + 0.294 @xmath7 0.120 ( n = 183 ) .",
    "as the reddening of stars in ngc 2264 is very small @xcite , the @xmath20-[3.6 ] color of class iii objects or photospheres should be close to 0 .",
    "we believe that the smaller mean @xmath20-[3.6 ] color for our photometry supports our contention that our systematic difference relative to @xcite and relative to @xcite is due to a zero - point error in their photometry , at least for 3.6 @xmath5 .",
    "we searched for optical and 2mass counterparts to the sources detected in irac with a search radius of 1@xmath13 .",
    "the master optical source catalogue we used was created from tables 3 ( `` c '' + i d objects ) , 8 ( `` w '' + 4 digit i d objects ) , and 9 ( `` s '' + i d objects ) of @xcite . among 21991 irac objects , 7869 objects",
    "have a 2mass counterpart and 17932 objects have an optical counterpart . as the optical data had better spatial resolution , 5 irac sources had 3 optical counterparts and 496 sources had two .",

    "both stars could be the optical counterpart of sst 10207 .",
    "as in most cases class i objects do not have normal optical colors , we tentatively identify the faint bms star c30995 as the optical counterpart of the class i star sst 10207 .",
    "the one class i star that we believe does fall in the pms locus is sst 12918 (= c35527 ) , an x - ray emission star .",
    "to check for completeness relative to the optical photometry , we identified _",
    "counterparts of optical sources in the central region of ngc 2264 covered by all 4 irac channels .",
    "the area is 1204 arcmin@xmath24 .",
    "there were 16,772 optical stars , excluding stars where a single _ spitzer _ source is matched to two or more optical stars ( 522 optical stars in total ) .",
    "the completeness is shown in figure [ figphotc ] .",

    "fainter than that , the detection fraction decreases rapidly . because stellar photospheres are relatively faint at 24 @xmath5 , the detection fraction in [ 24 ]",

    "@xcite introduced a variability index based upon the error - weighted flux difference between two epochs in order to search for variables .",
    "we have searched for variable objects in ngc 2264 in a similar way .",

    "we then calculated the differences in magnitude , the ratio of the difference , and the total error for a given passband .",
    "if the difference between two epochs was greater than 3.5 times the total error and greater than about 0.4 mag - the photometric error of daophot undersampled data was about 0.1 mag - then we classified the object as a variable source . in this process",

    "only two objects ( sst 13432 & 13612 ) showed a variation @xmath26 0.4 mag in one channel but only a small ( @xmath21 0.15 mag ) delta magnitude in the other channel - the variations in these two stars may be spurious . among the 28 variable candidates",

    "most of the bms stars ( 21/24 ) were disked stars ( class i , flat , or class ii ) .",
    "three stars ( c39036 = lkh@xmath10 71 , c35777 , and c48145 ) show the sed of stellar photospheres ( @xmath10 = -2.6  -2.8 ) . ogura 97 (= c32005 = sst 10710 ) , although the star is not classified as a bms star in @xcite , is a bms star as h@xmath10 emission has been detected by @xcite ; it is a class i object . with 21 disks and a total of 59 objects where",
    "we could have reliably detected a disk ( 82 - 15 - 8) , the fraction of bms objects with primordial disks is about 36% .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the primordial disk fraction of members in the pms locus . as we did not impose any limitation in brightness ,",
    "the fraction obtained above is a minimum value .",
    "if we restrict bms membership to those candidates with strong h@xmath10 emission ( membership class : `` + '' or `` h '' ) , the fraction increases to about 55% (= 18/33 ) .",
    "emission of some bms candidates , particularly the fainter ones .",
    "actually the bms candidates not detected in irac or only detected in [ 3.6 ] and/or [ 4.5 ] are mostly faint ( @xmath99 18 mag for strong h@xmath10 emission stars and @xmath99 17.5 mag for weak h@xmath10 emission stars ) . ]",
    "there are some stars that could be classified as bms stars ( class i or ii ) in figure [ figopt ] .",
    "we list 10 new bms candidates in table [ tab_bms ] and drew the color - magnitude diagram of class ii objects and three bms candidate class i objects in figure [ figbmscmd ] .",
    "three were not listed in table 12 of @xcite because of small values of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 0.5 mag ) , three were too faint ( @xmath99 20 mag ) and four had no signature of h@xmath10 emission .",
    "but most of the faint class i objects are not listed in table [ tab_bms ] because of their optical images and their spatial location ( field or halo ) - two ( sst 3145 & 7707 ) are too faint to discern whether they are faint stars or galaxies and two ( sst 9861 & 21808 ) are in the vicinity of faint galaxies ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "the high disk fraction of bms stars strongly suggests that bms stars are bona fide ysos .",
    "in addition , a well - known young disked k7 wtts star kh 15d in ngc 2264 is close to the lower boundary of the pms locus of ngc 2264 during its bright phase , but becomes a bms star during eclipse .",
    "the star is fainter by about 3.5 mag in @xmath102 during eclipse , but is bluer by about 0.2 mag in @xmath103 @xcite probably due to the contribution of scattered light .",
    "although the h@xmath10 emission of kh 15d is not detected photometrically , @xcite reported an h@xmath10 emission equivalent width of 103.1@xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the spectra of kh 15d during eclipse do not show any change in spectral type or reddening , indicating that the extinction is caused by larger dust grains @xcite . and",
    "the polarization dramatically increased from practically @xmath3 0% during out of eclipse to @xmath3 2% during eclipse @xcite .",
    "in addition the variation amplitude in [ 3.6 ] of kh 15d is nearly the same as that in @xmath25 ( see  7.2.5 ) , also indicative of gray extinction by large grains .",
    "kh15d therefore provides direct evidence in favor of the disk extinction model to explain bms stars .",
    "the well known bms star w90 (= s2144 = sst 9597 ) was first found by @xcite as an emission line a type star .",
    "he also pointed out that it is fainter by 3 magnitudes relative to other pms stars of similar spectral type in the cluster .",
    "its pms nature was confirmed spectroscopically by @xcite . from photometric studies",
    ", @xcite found many bms stars in the cluster .",
    "recently @xcite published a vast amount of archival and original photometric and spectroscopic data for w90 .",
    "they showed the variability and spectral changes of the star .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , w90 is very red in [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] .",
    "w90 could be classified as either a class i or class ii object .",
    "we classified the star as class ii due to its relatively bluer color in [ 8.0]-[24 ] .",
    "we present the spectral energy distribution of w90 in figure [ figsed ] .",
    "w90 shows excess emission in the near - ir as well as in all irac channels .",

    "the star is 1.@xmath6685 sw of kh 15d ( see figure [ figc35527 ] ) , and is barely detected in the digital sky survey .",
    "but in our cfht images we can see the object clearly . as can be seen in figure [ figc35527 ] ,",
    "the star is surrounded by a thin nebulosity .",
    "the star is a strong x - ray source ( detection significance = 75.05 ) .",
    "its 2mass colors are those of a highly reddened normal star . even in @xmath63-[3.6 ] , the star does not show any signature of an ir excess ( figure [ fig2ms ] ( upper left ) or figure [ figsed ] ( upper right ) ) .",
    "this may be caused in part by the variability of the object .",
    "but in @xmath63-[4.5 ] or longer wavelengths , the star shows an evident ir excess , which increases to longer wavelength .",
    "the star was detected in our sso @xmath25 band image ( date of observation : 1997 november 19 , ut = 16:15:47.5 , mjd = 50771.677627 ; no `` s '' i d was assigned ) .",
    "its @xmath25 magnitude was 17.765 @xmath7 0.068 ( n@xmath109 = 1 ) .",
    "the magnitude and colors from the observation with the cfht are @xmath25 = 18.480 , ( @xmath27)@xmath28 = 2.368 and ( @xmath103)@xmath61 = 5.299 .",
    "the star is very red and is variable .    the spectral energy distribution of this star is shown in figure [ figsed ] .",
    "as there is no direct method to determine the reddening of such a very red star , we tried to fit the optical @xmath110 and 2mass data to a model atmosphere of effective temperature 2600k and surface gravity @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting reddening @xmath77 is about 1.40 mag .",
    "the star shows excess emission only in irac channels and in 24 @xmath16 m .",
    "@xcite suggested ar 6a (= c33859 ) is an fu ori type pms star .",
    "irac colors , including mips [ 24 ] , indicate the star is a class ii object . from near - ir photometry and spectroscopy , @xcite estimated the reddening and temperature ( @xmath71 = 18 mag , @xmath112 = 3000 k ) .",
    "although the star has very red colors ( @xmath113 = 3.09 @xmath7 0.02 ) , the estimated reddening from its sed ( see figure [ figsed ] ) is @xmath73 3.65 mag if we adopt the optical spectral type of the star as g iii ( t@xmath114 5000 k ) suggested from spectral features in the k - band . this value is much smaller than the value estimated by @xcite .",
    "such a large discrepancy may be caused by their using limited , near - ir data which are affected by reddening as well as thermal emission , as they have pointed out .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted that its location in the near - ir c - c diagram can not be simply interpreted as the result of reddening .",
    "ar 6b (= sst 11837 ) was not detected in the deep optical survey of @xcite , but the irac colors , as well as the near - ir photometry of @xcite suggest that it is a class i object .",
    "the reddening of ar 6b can not be determined using the near - ir data mentioned above .",
    "if we assume the same reddening as that of ar 6a , we can not fit the sed at all .",
    "if we assume @xmath77 = 0.0 , the blackbody flux of the object is slightly fainter than the detection limit at @xmath25 ( @xmath115 -13.85 at @xmath25 = 22 mag ) .",
    "@xcite discovered a strong ir source just north of the cone nebula and interpreted it as the most massive and luminous object in ngc 2264 .",
    "currently the object is considered to be a deeply embedded , early - type star lying within a massive molecular core @xcite .",
    "this object is also known as ngc 2264 irs1 (= c36261 = 2mass j06411015 + 0929336 , @xmath25 = 19.068 , @xmath64 = 11.508 , @xmath116 = 7.643 , @xmath63 = 4.924 ) .",
    "allen s source is the brightest mid - ir source in ngc 2264 and is the only object saturated in all short exposure irac images .",
    "@xcite obtained the sed slope of the object ( @xmath10 = + 0.1 ) .",
    "although there are several ysos around irs1 , the slope measured by @xcite is unlikely to be affected as allen s source is one of the brightest objects in the sky in mid - ir and is far brighter than any of the neighboring objects .",
    "we consider allen s source to be a deeply embedded flat spectrum yso .",
    "a very strong , hard x - ray source ( exs-1 = sst 13380 , t@xmath117 100 mk ) lies 11@xmath13 southwest of allen s source @xcite . the object is detected in the short 3 channels of irac and therefore was not classified by its evolutionary stage . if we classify the object in the ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] , [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] ) diagram , exs-1 is a class i object .",
    "one of the more interesting objects in ngc 2264 , kh 15d ( = c36305 = sst 13485 ) .",
    "kh 15d is very close to irs1 , the brightest ir source in ngc 2264 , and the star is on the bright spike of irs1 .",
    "it is detected only in channels 1 and 2 of aors 3956736 and 3957248 ( phase = 0.31 of the eclipse light curve , @xcite ) , aors 3956480 and 3956992 ( phase = 0.85 of the eclipse light curve ) is on the bright spike and too faint to be measured . in channels 3 and 4 ,",
    "the signal is too weak relative to the brightness of the spike of ngc 2264 irs1 , and therefore could not be measured .",
    "its [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color is slightly red , but not so red as to be classified as a class ii object .",
    "recently , marengo et al . ( 2009 , in preparation ) have obtained the light curve of kh 15d in the four irac bands , and confirmed the amplitude in mid - ir wavelengths is the same as that in the optical , which implies that the opacity in the mid - ir is gray , and therefore the size of dust grains in the circumbinary disk around kh 15d is very large ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed mid - ir photometry of the young open cluster ngc 2264 surveyed with the irac and mips instruments of the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the results we obtained are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) we presented the _",
    "irac [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , [ 8.0 ] and mips [ 24 ] data of about 22,000 objects in ngc 2264 .",
    "we also searched for the optical , near - ir and x - ray counterparts of all mid - ir sources .",
    "\\(2 ) we classified the ysos in ngc 2264 using two classification schemes - one based on color - color diagrams , the other on the spectral energy distributions .",
    "we introduced a parameter @xmath35 in the photometric classification to make full use of the imformation from multicolor photometry .",
    "we also compared the two classifications and found them to be generally consistent with each other .",
    "\\(3 ) from the spatial distributions of disked stars ( class i and ii objects ) , we identified two subclusterings of class i objects in the cone region of @xcite .",
    "one was the well - known spokes cluster @xcite ; the other was located near the head of the cone nebula . on the other hand ,",
    "the s mon region of @xcite mostly comprised class ii objects .",
    "these subclusterings in ngc 2264 show a distinct difference in the distribution of sed slopes and the mean value of the sed slopes .",
    "\\(4 ) we examined the disk fraction of below the pms locus ( bms ) stars and found that the fraction with primordial disks to be about 35% .",
    "this value is higher than that of normal stars in the pms locus and supports the idea that bms stars are young stars with nearly edge - on disks .",
    "\\(5 ) we also obtained the result that the fraction of primordial disks increases as the distance from the most massive star s mon ( o7v ) increases .",
    "this is an important clue that the uv radiation and winds of massive stars affects the fate of primordial disks of nearby low - mass stars .",
    "\\(6 ) from a re - analysis of data for young open clusters observed with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , we found that a common disk lifetime was about 5 myr , the disk fraction of low - mass stars in ngc 2244 and @xmath95 vel was slightly lower than other clusters with a similar age , and that of @xmath96 cha , although the error is large , seems to be higher .",
    "this fact implies that the strength of the uv radiation field is one of the most important factors affecting the fate of disks around low - mass stars",

    "<S> we have performed mid - ir photometry of the young open cluster ngc 2264 using the images obtained with the _ spitzer _ space telescope irac and mips instruments and present a normalized classification scheme of young stellar objects in various color - color diagrams to make full use of the information from multicolor photometry . </S>",

    "<S> the fraction of stars with primordial disks is nearly flat between @xmath0 0.2  -0.5 , and that of transition disks is very high for solar mass stars . </S>",
