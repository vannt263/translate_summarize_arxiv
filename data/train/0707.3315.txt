    "otherwise , it is called a _ noncongruence _ subgroup .",
    "the existence of noncongruence subgroups of @xmath0 was confirmed by fricke @xcite and pick @xcite .",

    "a famous theorem of bely implies any compact complex smooth irreducible curve defined over @xmath5 , the algebraic closure of @xmath6 , can be realized ( in many ways ) as a modular curve ( defined in [ subsec : modcurve ] ) for a finite index subgroup of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "consequently , finite index subgroups arise naturally in many fields such as the theory of dessin denfant which includes galois coverings of the projective line @xcite , triangular groups @xcite , as well as the theory of translation surfaces @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "noncongruence subgroups of @xmath7 predominate congruence subgroups ( section 2.3 below ) .",
    "modular forms are generalizations of elliptic functions ( doubly periodic functions ) and enjoy plenty of wonderful properties .",
    "many important one variable formal power series arising in combinatorics or physics , such as the partition function , turn out to be closely related to modular forms .",
    "the theory of congruence ( elliptic ) modular forms is now well - developed due to the efforts of many mathematicians .",
    "it has very broad impacts including some important applications to information technology @xcite . in the early days , computational observations and conjectures",
    "were significant driving forces for the development of this theory .",
    "for example , ramanujan observed coefficients of @xmath8 satisfy special three - term recursions for small primes @xmath9 @xmath10where @xmath11 if @xmath12",
    ". in @xcite mordell showed that these recursions hold for all primes @xmath9 by using essentially hecke operators . in @xcite hecke defined hecke operators and proved that they satisfy @xmath13-term relations on each @xmath14-dimensional space of congruence modular forms .",
    "shortly after , petersson introduced the petersson inner product via which he showed the hecke operators can be diagonalized simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the readers are referred to ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) for a summary of the theory of newforms ( congruence modular form with particular properties ) developed by atkin and lehner @xcite , miyake @xcite , and li @xcite .",
    "the current considerable interest in modular forms is largely due to the vital role they played in the celebrated proof of fermat s last theorem ( flt ) by wiles @xcite . in his proof , wiles used a result of frey and ribet which says the taniyama - shimura - weil ( tsw ) conjecture implies flt .",
    "the tsw conjecture asserts the @xmath15-adic galois representations attached to an elliptic curve ( a genus one complete curve ) defined over @xmath6 are isomorphic to the @xmath15-adic deligne representations attached to a certain newform .",
    "the final proof of tsw ( @xcite ) is a major breakthrough in the very influential langlands program which is a system of conjectures connecting the @xmath15-adic cohomology theory of algebraic varieties with representation theory of cuspidal automorphic forms @xcite . in the sequel",
    ", we say an @xmath15-adic galois representation is  modular \" when it arises from a congruence automorphic form .    modular forms for noncongruence subgroups",
    "have already been considered by fricke and klein .",
    "however , there was no serious investigation of these functions till the late 1960 s as it was commonly believed that the hecke theory was missing . indeed , atkin conjectured that hecke operators defined classically have trivial actions on noncongruence modular forms and his conjecture was proven in part by serre @xcite and scholl @xcite and in general by berger @xcite",
    ".    however , the investigation in the past 40 years reveals the mathematical structure of noncongruence modular forms is still wonderfully rich . in @xcite ,",
    "atkin and swinnerton - dyer used computers together with algebra and combinatorics to work with noncongruence subgroups and noncongruence modular forms .",
    "they brought up many interesting and fundamental ideas and original observations .",
    "in particular , they studied the arithmetic of the fourier expansions @xmath16 of noncongruence modular forms and observed that for some forms with algebraic coefficients the sequences @xmath17 have unbounded denominators . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that if @xmath18 is a congruence holomorphic modular form , the sequence @xmath17 must admit bounded denominators @xcite .",
    "this observation gives a simple and clear criterion for distinguishing noncongruence modular forms .",
    "atkin and swinnerton also found @xmath9-adic analogue of the hecke three - term recursion by demonstrating the coefficients @xmath17 of some noncongruence modular forms satisfy @xmath19 modulo a power of @xmath9 depending on @xmath20 for some constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in @xcite a proof of the weight 2 dimension 1 case was provided .",
    "the modularity of this case would have followed from the taniyama - shimura - weil conjecture .",
    "for a few examples of dimension 2 or more , atkin and swinnerton - dyer found that such three - term congruences still exist with the forms diagonalized @xmath9-adically for each separate @xmath9 and the @xmath21 being over algebraic number fields in general different for each @xmath9 .",
    "several people ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) ) studied atkin and swinnerton - dyer ( asd ) congruences .",
    "the general situation for the weight 2 cases has been confirmed by several papers @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , using deep algebraic geometry and representation theory , scholl associated each @xmath14-dimensional space of noncongruence cuspforms with @xmath23-dimensional @xmath15-adic scholl representations and showed the existence of @xmath13-term @xmath9-adic recursions under general conditions .",
    "when @xmath24 scholl fully established the 3-term asd congruences .",
    "however when @xmath25 , the existence of a fixed basis for each of which satisfies 3-term asd congruences for all @xmath9 ( referred to as simultaneous diagonalization ) is rare .    around the same time interesting connections between modular forms for congruence and noncongruence subgroups began to merge . in @xcite scholl gave examples of 1 dimensional spaces of cuspform with the @xmath21 being eigenvalues of congruence cuspforms by showing the @xmath15-adic scholl representations associated to those cases are  modular \" . in @xcite ,",
    "berger found a quadratic relation satisfied by 2 noncongruence cuspforms and 2 congruence cuspforms .    in @xcite noncongruence subgroups with small indices",
    "are given considerable attention .",
    "recently , investigation has been focused on the so called noncongruence character groups , which are  almost \" congruence .",
    "these noncongruence subgroups are constructed by assigning characters to the generators of congruence subgroups .",
    "the lattice groups considered by rankin @xcite are examples of them .",
    "klein and fricke used  wurzelmodul \" to describe a hauptmodul of a genus zero noncongruence character group defined by a cyclic character . here , we will associate the fermat curve @xmath26 with the modular curve for the intersection of two particular character groups .    in @xcite ,",
    "li et al . gave a @xmath27-dimensional space of cuspforms for a noncongruence character group which satisfies simultaneous diagonalization .",
    "moreover , it was shown that @xmath21 are eigenvalues of explicit newforms .",
    "later , fang et al . found a few more examples of this kind @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", simultaneous diagonalization can rarely be achieved .",
    "more recently , atkin et al @xcite and long @xcite fully exhibited two cases which resemble the case in @xcite but are slightly more general . in each case , a basis depending on the congruence class of @xmath9 modulo a fixed integer is found , for each of the basis function the coefficients satisfy a 3-term asd congruence relation .",
    "meanwhile , modularity of each case was verified individually .",
    "these modularity results rely heavily on the decompositions of the associated @xmath15-adic scholl representations or their restrictions to suitable galois subgroups .",
    "in contrast , scholl exhibited other cases where the @xmath15-adic scholl representations are not reducible @xcite .",
