    "pulsars are effective astrophysical laboratories for quantum theory and gravitation theory . however , how to reproduce the observed radiation theoretically is still one of the most essential challenges in pulsar study .",
    "it is well known that the polarization observations are very important to provide much information about pulsar physics , but there are still many troubles in explaining the polarization data .",
    "one of the difficulties in understanding pulsar polarization observations is the polarization position angle jumps in mean ( or integrated ) pulses as well as in individual pulses [ 1 - 3 ] . _ for mean pulses _ , it is generally found that position angles would have discontinuities about 90@xmath0 at some longitudes where the linear polarization intensities are near zero ( totally depolarized ) . _ for individual pulses",
    "_ , the position angles would be dispersed or have two @xmath1 separated distributions at some observational longitude bins where the linear polarization percentages are remarkably small . a famous example to display the polarization position angle jumps in individual pulses",
    "is shown in fig.1 for psr b2020 + 28[1 ] . in case ` a ' and ` c ' , the two position angle distributions are clear , and the linear polarization percentages are obviously low . in case",
    "` b ' , there is only one position angle distribution , and the emission in each longitude point is highly linearly polarized .",
    "it means that such orthogonally distributed position angles are usually observed only in the part of the profiles where the linear polarization is low [ 4 ] .",
    "a conclusion from the observation is that , _ both for mean profiles and for individual pulses , the position angle jumps are related to low linear polarization ( percentage ) at all time_.    based on above observational facts , there should be two possibilities logically : one is that ` position angle jump ' causes ` low linear polarization ' , another is that ` low linear polarization ' causes ` position angle jump ' .",
    "many authors believe , without justification , that the position angle jumps should be attribute to the appearance of opm [ 1 - 3 ] , in - coherent superposition of the opm is the origin of depolarization . however , why the another possibility is impossible ?",
    "we investigate this possibility in this paper .    previously , stinebring et al .",
    "[ 1 ] concluded that most of pulsar emission occurs in one orthogonal mode or the other , which is called orthogonal polarization modes ( opm ) . at",
    "a given longitude , the plane of polarization can be of two perpendicular or nearly perpendicular states . which one can operate was governed by some variability as yet not understood .",
    "the opm can explain many things : the sharp jumps of position angles , the depolarization of linear as well as circular polarization due to the existence of both modes at the same time [ 2 ] .",
    "however , there is no acceptable theory to reproduce such orthogonal modes , which is called as ` opm problem ' .    for mean pulses",
    ", it is suggested that the depolarization and position angle jumps might be attribute to the relative longitude shifts of pulsar beams [ 5,6 ] .",
    "such kind of longitude shifts of pulsar beams is natural in the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) model [ 7 ] .",
    "for individual pulses , many authors believe that there are two orthogonal modes at a given longitude .",
    "nevertheless , there may be in fact two possibilities to produce such orthogonal modes .",
    "one is that the emission for a given frequency is emitted at different heights , and another is that there is an unknown emission mechanism to produce orthogonal modes at a same emission point [ 8 ] .",
    "the first possibility has been studied already [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "but for the second one , no acceptable theory has been found to produce such orthogonal modes hitherto known .",
    "thus , the ` opm problem ' still confuses the pulsar world .",
    "we ask a question here : are really such ` orthogonal modes ' the reason for the ` low linear polarization ' ?",
    "otherwise , might the ` low linear polarization ' be responsible for the observed ` orthogonal modes ' ?",
    "many authors believe that the reduction in the percentage of linear polarization is caused by in - coherent superposition of the opm .",
    "contrary to the above idea , another possibility ( i.e. , the ` low linear polarization ' is the reason for producing the observed ` position angle jumps ' ) is suggested in this paper . _",
    "our analysis and simulations show that , when the linear polarization percentages are low enough , the position angles would be distributed in two areas separated nearly ninety degrees_. a suggestion to check this idea is presented .",
    "we show how ` low linear polarization ' causes so - called ` position angle jumps ' in mean - pulses and in single - pulses in section 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "some troubles faced by opm radiation mechanism are summed up in section 4 .",
    "finally , conclusion and discussion are given in section 5 .",
    "almost certainly , for observed mean - pulses , the smoothly changing position angle curves will suddenly jump at some longitudes where the linear polarization is highly depolarized .",
    "these facts can be understood under the properties of stokes parameters .",
    "it could be verified mathematically that the position angle would jump 90@xmath0 when the line of sight travels across a _ singular point _ [ 5 , 6 ] where the linear polarization intensity is zero .",
    "the four stokes parameters @xmath2 , from which one can obtain linear polarization intensity @xmath3 and position angle @xmath4 ( see equ.(1 ) below ) , are functions of observational longitude @xmath5 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we let @xmath6 , as the linear polarization is focused on here . at a singular point ( @xmath7 )",
    ", @xmath8 means @xmath9 expanding @xmath10 and @xmath11 near singular point , we come to @xmath12 @xmath13 assuming @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the lowest non - zero power terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath16 $ ] , one could find that @xmath17 should be @xmath18 as long as @xmath19 is an odd number ) . ] .",
    "it is very possible that @xmath20 , thus , position angle _ naturally _ jumps @xmath21 if @xmath8 [ 6 ] .",
    "therefore , _ the reason that position angle jumps in integrated profiles might be why the beamed radiation is depolarized_. depolarization should be the cause of position angle jumps in mean - pulses .",
    "there are many ways to cause depolarization .",
    "first of all , depolarization may have an intrinsic origin .",
    "as emission beams are formed in different heights , and each of them has different position angle , depolarization must take place by incoherent superposition of such emission beams .",
    "in the ics model [ 7 ] , different emission beams are formed in different heights , hence , the retardation and aberration effects could make the apparent emission beams be superposed incoherently [ 5,6 ] .",
    "secondly , depolarization might be originated from propagation process , such as the scattering by interstellar medium or magnetospheric plasma [ 4 ] , and the propagating properties of different radiation modes in plasma .",
    "the third way might be the result of observational effect .",
    "since the stokes parameters are added from many frequency channels after de - dispersion , the emissions in each frequency channel are incoherent superposed .",
    "such kind of treatment in observation should also depolarize the original radiation .",
    "there are many factors to reduce the precision of observational results , such as noises from the observational system and the sky background . usually , we put thresholds for the total intensity ( @xmath22 ) and the linear polarization intensity ( @xmath23 ) in each longitude bin in order to exclude fake polarization due to the observational error .",
    "for example , we select observational data whose @xmath22 and @xmath23 are greater than 5 to 10 times of off - pulse rms . however , as will be discussed in this section , some fake polarization data , which may responsible for the observed ` position angle jumps ' in individual pulses [ 5 ] , do survive from such selection .",
    "some observational uncertainties can cause the observed position angles to ` jump ' in individual pulses , such as the ` error transference ' ( section 3.1 ) , the unequal rms of stokes parameter @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( section 3.2 ) , and the fake linear polarization ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "all these uncertainties can bring wrong polarization information .      if @xmath24 is a random number , then the function @xmath25 is also random .",
    "the random distribution of @xmath26 is known as long as the distribution of @xmath24 is given .",
    "for example , let the distribution function of @xmath24 as a gaussian distribution , with the expectation value @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution function of @xmath26 depends on the function @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath28 is a monotonous function near @xmath27 , the distribution function of @xmath26 is approximately a gaussian . whereas , if @xmath28 is a very complex function near @xmath27 , the distribution function of @xmath26 is also complicated .",
    "it is known that the position angle @xmath4 is a function of the stokes parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , depending on the signs of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from @xmath29",
    ", one can get a general expression for @xmath4 , where the value region of @xmath4 is from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . ]",
    "@xmath32 , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] which is ` singular'(unusual ) near @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) if @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this property of singularity of @xmath4 would cause two error distribution peaks ( see fig.2 ) , which will be discussed later in section 3.2 . in a word ,",
    "the observational uncertainty ( error ) of @xmath10 and @xmath11 could bring an error distribution of @xmath4 in two regions with 90@xmath0 separation by the error transference effect .",
    "such observational results might be mistakenly considered as position angle ` jumps ' in a real beamed radiation .      usually , the rms of the stokes parameter @xmath10 and that of @xmath11 are not equal for an astronomical polarimetry , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be as large as several percentages in observations .",
    "the observed linear polarization position angles could ` jump ' during different observing time as long as @xmath38 . as demonstrated in fig.3",
    ", we see that @xmath41 is about @xmath30 , and @xmath42 is about @xmath21 .",
    "the reason that @xmath43 might be diversity .",
    "for example , for some polarimetry , the stokes parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are computed from the hybrid networks out - put signals . here",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the observed intensity from two orthogonal dipole antenna , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the intensity received from a system which has been rotated 45 degrees . for a dipole antenna , @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 are obtained directly .",
    "however , the @xmath48 and @xmath49 are yielded through a turnstile junction where the phase mis - alignment can make the rms of @xmath48 ( and @xmath49 ) larger than the rms of @xmath46 ( and @xmath47 ) .",
    "so , the rms of @xmath10 and that of @xmath11 can not be equal because of the imperfection of the turnstile junction .",
    "simulations of this kind of polarimetry are given in fig .",
    "4 ( see the appendix ) , from which we see that    * the observed percentages of polarization @xmath50 are much greater than the true percentage @xmath51 , if @xmath51 is small enough . observed linear polarization may be larger than that of the true value . *",
    "the position angle ` jumps ' takes place when linear polarization percentage @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 , there is few possibilities to make position angle jump .",
    "because the observational uncertainty is of random , position angle jumps that come of this kind of errors discussed above can be avoided by more time observation .",
    "it is almost impossible that position angle jump due to observational uncertainty appears in integrated profiles .      for a telescope with an effective detection area @xmath54 , a frequency bandwidth @xmath55 , a time constant @xmath56 , and a systematical noise temperature @xmath57 , then the systematical noise flux @xmath58 is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the boltzmann s constant , and",
    "the off - pulse rms @xmath61 is @xmath62 whereas there is a signal with intensity flux @xmath63 , the rms of the signal flux is @xmath64 ( the on - pulse rms ) @xmath65 where @xmath63 can be one of the out - put signals from the hybrid networks , such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , which are correspondent to the linearly polarized components of the input signals at position angle @xmath30 , @xmath21 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , and to the right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized components .    because @xmath70 , the rms of @xmath63 is @xmath71 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath58 is accurate enough ( i.e. , we have enough time to measure @xmath58 ) , then @xmath72 , which will be used in the following discussion .",
    "if we let @xmath73 square meters , @xmath74mhz , @xmath75ms , and @xmath76k , then @xmath61 is about 0.2 jy . for @xmath77jy[9",
    "] , then @xmath78 which is more than three times that of @xmath61 , and the fake linear polarization percentage could be as large as @xmath79 .",
    "thus , some data , whose linear polarization is originated from such uncertainty , _ can also exceed _ the observational threshold level with an un - negligible possibility .",
    "we might be in a dilemma if there are really so - called orthogonal polarization modes in pulsars beams .",
    "first , how does the opm radiative mechanism produce ?",
    "no reasonable theory has been appeared in literature .",
    "furthermore , the two orthogonal modes should be in - coherent , which makes the opm more difficult to be set up .",
    "the suggestion for observed ` orthogonal modes ' in mean - pulses by xu at al .",
    "[ 6 ] is not a real one .",
    "( in their calculations , two components are emitted in - coherently from different regions . ) furthermore , if the two modes are coherent , the total radiation is elliptically polarized , thus no position angle ` jump ' appears .",
    "secondly , why havent we seen that single - pulses are highly polarized , but the position angle distribution is till separated by 90@xmath0 ( like fig.5 ) ?",
    "individual pulses , which could be highly polarized , are generally conjectured to be from single radiation elements .",
    "since two orthogonal modes are incoherent , a radiation element might emit only one of the opr modes at one time .",
    "therefore , it is possible to observe some highly linearly polarized individual pulses , while the position angles of which are 90@xmath0 separated .",
    "unfortunately , observation result similar to that of fig.5 has _ never _ been found .",
    "thirdly , how to explain the non - orthogonal separation of position angles in the regime of opm ?",
    "non - orthogonal emission modes have proverbially been found in observation [ 1 ] .",
    "these facts are rigorous for anyone to theorize opm models .",
    "from analysis above some conclusions and discussions are reached :    \\1 . another possible way to solve the problem of position angle ` _ jumps _ ' in pulsars beamed radio emission was proposed .",
    "there might be _ no real _ ` orthogonal polarization modes ' in the emission at all .",
    "position angle jumps due to the observational uncertainties could appear in observed individual pulses when the linear polarization _",
    "percentages _ are small ( not only the linear polarization intensity to be small ) .",
    "at least part of the observed position angle jumps in individual pulses and mean - pulses can be explained by depolarization and observational uncertainty .    for a real pulsar , we must put together these two possible factors to investigate the position angle variation in the individual pulses as well as in the integrated pulses .",
    "for example , observational uncertainty might be the main reason of position angle separation near point ` a ' in fig.1 . nevertheless , near point ` c ' , orthogonal and non - orthogonal separations are clear , which might be the result of the relative longitude shifts of pulsar beams [ 6 ] and the observational uncertainties .",
    "rathnsree & rankin[10 ] pointed out that , for psr b1929 + 10 , lower degree of polarization is seen simultaneously with the presence of ` orthogonal ' modes whereas the polarized power is not seen to be highly correlated with the position angle flip .",
    "also , they have got dynamic pictures of the orthogonal polarization mode changes for psr b2110 + 27 at 430 mhz , and they found the transition from the dominant mode to the other orthogonal one and back are _",
    "rapid_. most of the transition is achieved over time scales of a individual period , and the change of modes does not seem to be any periodicity in time evolution ( like a _ stochastic _ process ) .",
    "all this observational facts have the properties of observational uncertainties discussed in section 3 .    for psr b0525 + 21[1 ] at 1404 mhz ,",
    "the position angle sweep is s - shaped in the averaged profile .",
    "the polarization position angles in individual pulses are also an ` s ' shape distribution , but two weak patches of ` orthogonal modes ' on the outside edges of the profile where more individual pulses have very small percentages of linear polarization .",
    "these two patches appearance should come of the observational uncertainty according to our analysis .",
    "this statement _ can be checked _ by future expriment of observation .",
    "\\3 . from simulations",
    ", we see that the jumped position angles are distributed near @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , there are observational data which does show that the position angles distribute near @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the scatter plots , such as fig.26 , fig.37 in stinebring et al .",
    "if the rms of @xmath11 less than that of @xmath10 , the jumped position angles should be near @xmath30 and @xmath21 , like psr 0525 + 21 ( fig.2 in [ 1 ] ) in observations .",
    "there are observational data where the jumped position angles are not distributed near @xmath30 , @xmath68 , @xmath21 , and @xmath69 , which could be intrinsic in polarimetry or resultant from the longitude shift of beam phases [ 6 ] .",
    "the idea suggested in this paper can be checked experimentally .",
    "we can input the polarimetry a simulated lower polarized and pulsed signal to see if two @xmath21 separated position angle distribution can appear in the output . if such distribution can also be obtained , the opm in pulsar emission should be doubted .",
    "for the kind of polarimetry discussed in section 3 , let s study a partially polarized wave , with the total intensity @xmath22 , the un - polarized intensity @xmath80 , the percentage of linear polarization @xmath81 , the percentage of circular polarization @xmath82 , and the position angle @xmath4 .",
