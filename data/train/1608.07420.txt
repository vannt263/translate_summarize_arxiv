    "dense ensembles of gan nanowires evolve during growth to ensembles of nanowires with smaller densities and larger diameters .",
    "however , the fraction of the surface area covered by the nanowires remains unchanged , which rules out radial growth of nanowires as the origin of coalescence .",
    "instead , we have found that the nanowires bundle together after reaching a certain critical height to reduce the surface energy of their side facets at the expense of the elastic energy due to their bending @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that the elastic bending energy can be reduced by plastic relaxation at the coalescence joints .",
    "dislocations at the joints @xcite form small angle boundaries and reduce the curvature of the nanowires .",
    "since these dislocations run across the nanowires , the strain relaxation at the free side surface restricts the range of their elastic fields to distances comparable with the nanowire diameters .",

    "the bent segments of the nanowires constitute a significantly larger volume than the coalescence joints themselves and manifest themselves by extended tails of the diffraction lines .",

    "the common assumption that each small volume of the sample contributes to the diffraction intensity independently and only according to its local strain state @xcite is not applicable , and the dependence of the integral breadth on the reflection order does not follow a linear law .",

    "this situation contrasts to the common case of relative rotation of two bulk crystallites where the dislocation row runs along the whole boundary between crystallites . denoting the number of the dislocations in the row by @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 and hence @xmath58    if the dislocations in the row are equidistant , the dislocation strain is relaxed on the distance @xmath53 and the logarithmic term in eq .",

    "we generalize our analysis of the energy balance by considering a partial relaxation by dislocations .",
    "let us now estimate the total density of dislocations introduced into the nanowire ensemble .",
    "for an array of parallel dislocations in a bulk crystal , the dislocation density is defined as the number of dislocations per unit area oriented normally to the dislocation lines .",

    "in addition , their strain fields are relaxed at distances from the joints exceeding the nanowire diameter . as a result , the impact of these dislocations on , particularly , the luminous efficiency of nanowires is certainly much less pronounced than the effect of the same density of dislocations intersecting a heteroepitaxial layer .",

    "dislocations release most of the nanowire bending , leaving the effective distance @xmath83 , which describes the residual bending , much smaller than the distance @xmath9 between nanowires .",
    "thus , most of the elastic energy of bending can be released by creation of dislocations at the joint .",
    "the energy minimization gives a very dense dislocation array , with the distance between dislocations of about 1  nm .",
    "however , plastic relaxation at a joint to the energy minimum may be restricted . at the beginning of a bundling event , two nanowires first touch each other by atomically flat side facets .",
    "an introduction of dislocations at a border between two perfect crystallites may be kinetically suppressed , despite being energetically favorable .",

    "evidently , the profile obtained under this assumption is in gross disagreement with the experimental one .",
    "the comparison of the diffraction line widths in successive reflection orders as originally proposed by williamson and hall @xcite is an established tool of the size - strain analysis since decades@xcite and has been used for gan nanowire samples as well @xcite .",
    "the williamson - hall analysis is based on the assumption that the displacements of atoms are correlated only on short range , so that every small volume of the sample diffracts independently according to its local strain @xcite",
    ". then , the broadening due to an inhomogeneous strain is proportional to the reflection order while the broadening due to finite sizes of the crystallites does not depend on the reflection order .",

    "our study suggests that the high - density ensembles of spontaneously formed gan nanowires are not free of extended defects , but actually beset with dislocations .",
    "these defects originate from the overwhelming disposition of gan nanowires to bundle after they have reached a certain critical length .",
    "this process is driven by the reduction of the surface energy of the side facets of the nanowires at the expense of the bending of their bottom segments .",
    "our energy calculations predict that the elastic energy of bending can be reduced by the creation of dislocations at the joints .",
    "these dislocations possess comparatively small elastic energy since their strain fields are relaxed at distances exceeding the nanowire diameter due to the presence of free surfaces .    to elucidate the actual strain state of gan nanowire ensembles ,",
    "we have compared the experimental x - ray diffraction profiles from nanowire ensembles exhibiting substantial coalescence by bundling to calculated profiles assuming independent distributions of the lengths of the nanowire segments , their diameters , and the effective distances between nanowires that decribe their residual bending .",
    "the parameters yielding a good fit between the experiment and simulated x - ray diffraction profiles indicate that the bending is indeed partly accommodated by dislocations at the joints .",
    "the fact that the nanowires exhbit a residual bending suggests that plastic relaxation may be kinetically hindered by the difficulty to introduce dislocations when the atomically flat facets of the two nanowires meet .",
    "however , plastic relaxation at the joints may also induce the creation of large - angle boundaries between coalesced nanowire segments .",
    "the x - ray diffraction profiles studied in the present work are insensitive to the microstructure of the joints because of their small volume , and the available microcopic studies in the literature @xcite do not clarify this question either . clearly , dedicated microscopic studies are needed to reveal the actual microstructure of the joints .",
    "the dislocation density in typical gan nanowire ensembles such as investigated in the present work is on the order of @xmath182  @xmath43 , i.e. , similar to the one encountered in heteroepitaxial gan films grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "however , contrary to the situation in films , the dislocations at the tilt boundary of bundled nanowires intersect the nanowire bundle in radial direction , and do not propagate along the nanowire axis .",
    "the effect of these dislocations is thus much less detrimental than that of threading dislocations intersecting a heteroepitaxial layer .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that these boundary dislocations act as nonradiative centers as well , and it would certainly be desirable to avoid their formation . since the bundling of nanowires is inevitable once the nanowire lengths significantly exceed the distances between them , the only way to avoid this process is a drastic reduction of the nanowire nucleation density .",
    "this reduction , in turn , may be achieved either by selective area growth or by employing a substrate with structural and chemical properties that reduce the nucleation rate of gan nanowires .",
