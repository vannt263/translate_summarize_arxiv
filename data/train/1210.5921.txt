    "for solving non - convex optimization problems , a tool that is becoming more important is * generalized conjugation*. in this paper we introduce a family of coupling functions , the g - coupling functions , which will allow us to see in a different way duality schemes .",
    "the usual properties found in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) are related to a fixed coupling function , but here we consider ( for a specified function @xmath0 ) a family of coupling functions .",
    "these coupling functions are motivated by gap functions .",
    "it is interesting to point out , that many of these ( gap ) functions have similar properties .",
    "however , in some cases they are functions of one vector and it is important , since they are linked to specified optimization problems , that those functions have zeros .",
    "g - coupling functions will be defined as functions in two variables and they might not have zeros .",
    "even more , given a specified proper function @xmath0 , it is shown that a sub - family of this family of coupling functions satisfies many interesting properties .    in section 2 , we describe how many gap functions have similar properties , which are useful for the definition of g - coupling functions .    in section 3 , it is found the definition of g - coupling function with properties related to generalized conjugation using this family of functions and a fixed proper function @xmath0 .    in section 4 , it can be seen how these ideas can be applied in the equilibrium problem .",
    "in several works already published , there can be found definitions of gap functions for particular problems .",
    "now we present 3 concrete examples .    in @xcite , it is consider the following variational inequality problem : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a maximal monotone correspondence ( i.e. , @xmath3 for every @xmath4 with @xmath5 and if there exists @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 , for all @xmath5 and for all @xmath8 , then @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is found as a gap function the following one : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a non - empty closed convex set .",
    "this function happens to be non - negative and convex , and it is equal to zero only in solutions of @xmath13 .    the theory of the equilibrium problem begun with the paper written by blum and oettli @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a non - empty closed convex set and @xmath16 is a function that satisfies :    1 .",

    "if it vanishes at @xmath23 , then @xmath23 is a solution of @xmath24 .    in @xcite ,",

    "gap functions are used to transform an special equilibrium problem ( for example the vip is a particular class of ep ) into a minimization problem .",
    "now our attention is focused in using coupling functions that could be related , at least in some general aspect , to gap functions .",
    "therefore these functions must link both primal and dual variables . since these coupling functions must be related to a sense of  gap \" , we consider these functions as non - negative and with 2 arguments .",
    "let us remember that for the minimization problem , the convex conjugation theory allows us to generate a dual problem and there is implicit another concept of gap function ( see @xcite ) : consider @xmath31 . \\qquad",

    "this analysis is summarized in the following scheme : @xmath53 @xmath54 if @xmath40 is proper and convex , a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring that there will be no duality gap ( @xmath55 ) is that @xmath40 be l.s.c . at 0",
    "( in general @xmath35 l.s.c . does not imply that @xmath40 would be l.s.c . ) .",
