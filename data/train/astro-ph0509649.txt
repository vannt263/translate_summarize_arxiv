    "one of the first science observations carried out with the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al . 2004 ) was the non - proprietary extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) which was designed to characterize the infrared sky at previously unexplored sensitivities .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "mission first uncovered the presence of infrared luminous galaxies in the local universe ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ; soifer et al . 1987 ) , and the _ iso _ infrared ( elbaz et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "rodighiero et al . 2005 ) and ground - based submillimeter and millimeter observations ( blain et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) have highlighted the importance that infrared luminous galaxies have on the general understanding of galaxy evolution . since the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) peaks in the far - infrared ( fir ) ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) , studying the properties of galaxies that are bright in the fir is crucial for constraining models of galaxy evolution .    in this paper , we present 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m observations of the xfls field using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , rieke et al .",
    "the xfls is a 4deg@xmath5 survey .",
    "the swire _ spitzer",
    "_ survey ( londsdale et al . 2004 ) covers a wider area ( 49deg@xmath5 ) to similar depths , and deeper observations covering smaller areas are being taken by the mips instrument team as part of the guaranteed time observers ( gto ) program ( e.g. , dole et al .",
    "2004a ) and other groups .",
    "although the xfls is not unique in terms of depth or area coverage , the field has a large number ( @xmath6 ) of spectroscopic redshifts ( p. choi et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ; f. marleau et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , ancillary radio ( condon et al . 2003 ) , and optical imaging data ( fadda et al . 2004 ) that permit detailed multi - wavelength studies over a relatively large area . in this paper",
    ", we measure the source counts and use the available redshifts to constrain the rest - frame spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and derive the average infrared properties for the xfls 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m populations .",
    "a cosmology of h@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the xfls survey covers a 4deg@xmath5 region ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) within the northern continuous viewing zone of _ spitzer_. inside the xfls main field a smaller verification strip of 0.25deg@xmath12 centered at @xmath13 , @xmath14 was observed with an integration time of 4 times that of the main survey to characterize the completeness and source reliability of the main survey . in total ,",
    "27.7 hours of xfls observations were taken in 2003 december with the mips instrument .",
    "an additional 16.8 hours of observations within the xfls main field were taken in 2005 may to characterize the performance of the 70@xmath0 m array at warmer telescope temperatures ( @xmath15k ) .",
    "these observations produced useful data at 70@xmath0 m , but the 160@xmath0 m data were not usable .",
    "figure  1 shows the layout of the observations .",
    "all of the mips observations were taken using the medium scan - rate mapping mode ( 4.2s data collection events [ dces ] ) .",
    "the main - survey data were taken with adjacent 2deg scan legs that were offset in the cross - scan direction by @xmath16 ( nearly the full field of view of the arrays ) .",
    "the main - survey was covered twice to identify potential asteroids and to increase the redundancy of the data set .",
    "unfortunately , half of the mips-70 array was rendered useless after launch due to a cable failure outside the instrument ( rieke et al .",
    "therefore , at 70@xmath0 m each position of the main survey was covered by only one scan leg .",
    "since the data were not scheduled exactly as originally planned , slight rotations between the 8 astronomical observation requests ( aors ) yielded small gaps with zero coverage in the south - west corner of the main - survey 70@xmath0 m map .",
    "the verification strip was observed using 4 aors with 0.5deg scan legs at the medium scan rate .",
    "each aor covered the 0.5deg@xmath170.5deg field using cross - scan steps of @xmath18 ( slightly less than half an array field of view ) .",
    "the warm test data taken in 2005 may were centered on the 70@xmath0 m main - field .",
    "these data consisted of 6 aors with 1.75deg scan legs .",
    "cross - scan steps of @xmath18 were used to map the 1.75deg@xmath171.75deg field once .",
    "table  1 shows the average integration times , sensitivities , and area coverage for the 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m observations .",
    "the raw 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m ( mips - germanium [ ge ] ) data were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) archive and were reduced using the offline ge reprocessing tools ( gert ) , available from the public ssc website .",
    "the gert uses an offline version of the ssc pipeline to produce the basic calibrated data products ( bcds ) , following the algorithms derived by the mips instrument team and the mips instrument support team ( gordon et al .",
    "the processing was done using the latest software ( ssc pipeline version s12 ) to take advantage of improvements not currently available for the online xfls data products ( made with pipeline version s11 ) .",
    "bcd processing has two main steps : ( 1 ) calculation of the slope of the data ramp , and ( 2 ) calibration of the slope image . for the xfls mips - ge data ,",
    "the raw 4.2s data ramps are comprised of 32 non - destructive reads per pixel ( one dce ) . after correcting for the electronic nonlinearity , cosmic ray events and other discontinuities",
    "are identified in the data ramps .",
    "the ssc pipeline identifies discontinuities using a maximum likelihood technique ( hesselroth et al .",
    "linear slopes are calculated for the ramp segments between discontinuities and checked for consistency .",
    "the slopes from the segments are combined based on the empirical errors estimated from the scatter of the data within the ramp segments .",
    "average slopes for each pixel are calculated to produce an uncalibrated slope image .",
    "the second step of bcd processing is the calibration of the slope image .",
    "the calibration of mips - ge data is based on frequent measurements of internal stimulator flashes ( stims ) which are used to track the responsivity of the detectors as a function of time . for the xfls",
    "medium scan - rate data , the stim flashes are observed every 25 dces ( 118s ) .",
    "the stim flash signal is measured by subtracting the previous `` background '' dce from the stim frame which is taken at the same position on the sky . for each aor , a stim response function ( @xmath19 $ ] ) is calculated from interpolating between the stim minus background measurements .    after the determination of the stim response as a function of time ( @xmath19 $ ] ) ,",
    "the bcd data are calibrated using the following equation : @xmath20/ic,\\ ] ] where u(t ) is the uncalibrated slope image , dark is the dark calibration file , and ic is the illumination correction calibration file which corrects for the combined illumination pattern from the telescope and the stim flash signal .",
    "the dark and ic calibration files are stable and are generated by combining data from several different campaigns to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "the flux conversion factor ( @xmath21 ) converts the instrument units into physical surface brightness units of mjysr@xmath22 and is derived from observations of standard calibrators ( sec .",
    "3.4 ) .",
    "before the 70@xmath0 m bias level was lowered in 2004 march , the 70@xmath0 m data showed significant data artifacts .",
    "examples and discussion of mips - ge artifacts are shown in the mips data handbook .",
    "the two main artifacts impacting the xfls data are the stim flash latents and the variations of the slow response as a function of time .",
    "the 160@xmath0 m data are affected by these issues to a lesser degree due to the faster time constants of the 160@xmath0 m stressed - germanium detectors . for point sources , the stim latent and slow response residuals are additive effects .",
    "the filtering of the 160@xmath0 m data is straight - forward .",
    "we used the filtered bcds products , which remove a running median per pixel as a function of time by subtracting the median value for the surrounding dces closest in time ( ignoring the current dce , stim dces , and bad data ) . this high - pass time",
    "median filter removes data artifacts as well as the extended cirrus emission . to remove the stim latent artifacts at 160@xmath0 m",
    ", we simply ignored the first dce after the stim flash since the stim latents decay away within one dce .",
    "the filtering process for the 70@xmath0 m data is slightly more complicated .",
    "the time median filter by itself does not remove all of the data artifacts .",
    "stim latents remain for many dces and are correlated by column . since the scan map direction is nearly along the columns of the array ( along the y - axis ) , the column artifacts are amplified .",
    "we remove the column residuals by subtracting the median of the values along each column for every bcd . the combination of the high - pass time median filter per pixel and the column median filter removes the bulk of the data artifacts at 70@xmath0 m .",
    "the resultant rms is lower for narrow high - pass median filter widths ( @xmath23 dces ) , but narrow filter windows can yield significant negative side - lobes around bright sources . in addition , column filtering does not maintain point source calibration for the brightest sources ( @xmath24jy ) . to avoid significant negative side - lobes and to preserve calibration ,",
    "the filtering of the mips - ge data was done in two passes .",
    "the data from the first filtering pass were co - added , and sources were extracted ( sec .",
    "3.3 ) to find the location of the bright sources .",
    "the source positions within the original bcds were masked and new filtering corrections were calculated in the second pass , ignoring the pixels containing sources . this second - pass filtering technique minimizes the data artifacts while preserving point - source calibration .",
    "different filtering methods were tested and optimized using the gert . at 70@xmath0 m , we applied column filtering followed by a high - pass time median filter with a width of 12 dces to yield the deepest image .",
    "the final sensitivity of the filtered 70@xmath0 m image was improved by more than a factor of two in comparison to data with no filtering .",
    "filtering has less of an impact at 160@xmath0 m , but is useful for deep observations of faint point sources .",
    "we adopted a high - pass time median filter width of 12 dces for the 160@xmath0 m data using the second - pass filtering technique as done for 70@xmath0 m .",
    "the filtered bcds were coadded using the ssc mosaicing and source extraction software ( mopex ) ( makovoz & marleau 2005 ) .",
    "the data were combined ignoring bad data flagged in the bcd mask files ( bmask ) and the bad pixels defined by the static pixel mask ( pmask ) . using the redundancy of the mips data , additional spurious data values",
    "were removed via outlier rejection .",
    "the remaining data were corrected for array distortions and projected onto a sky grid with square pixels that were more than 2 times smaller than the original pixels .",
    "the output mosaic pixels are @xmath25 at 70@xmath0 m and @xmath26 at 160@xmath0 m .",
    "the data were averaged using weights proportional to the fractional area subtended by the original pixels as projected onto the output pixel grid .",
    "since the calibration of the main , verification , and the warm 70@xmath0 m data sets are consistent within measurement errors , all data were combined to yield the deepest images .",
    "sources were extracted from the final images using mopex .",
    "the mopex software uses a point - source response function ( prf ) image to optimize source detection and point source fitting .",
    "a prf calibration image was made for each mips band by coadding isolated bright point sources within the xfls field . a point source probability ( psp ) image was made from non - linear matched filtering of the input image with the prf .",
    "the psp image represents the probability of having a point source above the noise at each pixel .",
    "the psp image was multiplied by the input image to yield the filtered image used for source detection .",
    "the filtered image enhances the presence of point sources in the mosaic while smoothing out noise features that do not match the input prf , providing a more robust image for source detection .",
    "after source detection , the original images were fitted with the prf image via @xmath27 minimization to extract source positions and flux densities .",
    "regions containing multiple peaks were de - blended . for extended sources and/or close blends , not well fitted by the prf , large aperture measurements were used to derive the total flux density for the source .",
    "the noise across the images is non - uniform .",
    "for optimal source detection and extraction , an accurate representation of the uncertainties is needed .",
    "the mopex uncertainty image based on the input bcd pipeline uncertainties is useful for identifying the relative uncertainties across the image , but the pipeline errors typically underestimate the absolute uncertainty level for low background regions .",
    "the median level of the mopex uncertainty image was scaled to match the average empirical noise in the mosaics . by using a properly scaled uncertainty image",
    ", we find an average @xmath27 for the fitted point sources of @xmath28 , suggesting that the uncertainty image is self - consistent with the average point source errors in the data .",
    "several tests were done to validate the photometric results from mopex .",
    "no calibration differences were found for different sub - sets of the data .",
    "we also compared the photometry done with the mopex software with that from the program starfinder ( diolaiti et al .",
    "both programs use an empirical prf to fit source flux density .",
    "the results from mopex and starfinder agree to better than 5% for bright point sources ( @xmath29mjy at 70@xmath0 m and @xmath30200mjy at 160@xmath0 m ) and better than 10% rms down to the limits of the catalog , consistent with the uncertainties in the data . for faint sources detected in the mips - ge bands ,",
    "prf fitting techniques yield more reliable results than aperture measurements . by comparing results between the verification data and the main survey",
    ", we find a consistency of @xmath31% for prf matching techniques and a dispersion for aperture measurements of larger than @xmath32% at faint flux density levels .",
    "the absolute calibration is derived using observations of stars at 70@xmath0 m and observations of asteroids and well - studied luminous infrared galaxies at 160@xmath0 m .",
    "the data were processed assuming flux conversion factors of 634 mjysr@xmath22 per mips-70 data unit and 42 mjysr@xmath22 per mips-160 data unit .",
    "the flux densities in the source catalogs were multiplied by the correction factors of 1.16 and 1.17 for the mips-70 and mips-160 bands respectively , which includes the color corrections associated with a constant @xmath33 sed and updated calibration conversion factors based on the latest measurements .",
    "additional color corrections for sources with non - constant @xmath33 seds are negligible since the color corrections are similar for the range of seds appropriate for galaxies ; @xmath34 , where @xmath353 . for flux density ranges of 50mjy2jy ,",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainty is estimated to be about 15% and 25% for the 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m bands respectively .",
    "no corrections have been made for possible flux nonlinearities , which may be significant for sources brighter than this nominal flux density range .",
    "observers are recommended to check the latest information on mips calibration at the ssc web site .",
    "we confirmed that the absolute 70@xmath0 m flux density scale for the xfls data is consistent with previous measurements made by _",
    "iras _ to within 10% . for comparison with _ iras",
    "_ , we interpolated between the flux densities in _ iras_-60 and _ iras_-100 bands ( beichman et al .",

    "are defined as s24@xmath36 s@xmath37(23.7@xmath0 m ) , s70@xmath36 s@xmath37(71.4@xmath0 m ) , and s160@xmath36 s@xmath37(155.9@xmath0 m ) . ] applying the appropriate color corrections .",
    "for the five brightest sources in the field detected by _",
    "iras _ , we derive a flux density ratio of _ spitzer / iras _ @xmath38 at 71.4@xmath0 m .",
    "the calibration at 160@xmath0 m is more uncertain given that xfls sources have not been observed previously at wavelengths longer than 100@xmath0 m .",
    "simple sed model fits to the data indicate that the calibration at 160@xmath0 m is consistent with _ iras _ to within 30% .",
    "the mips - ge mosaics and catalogs are available online at the ssc website . for both of the mips-70 and 160@xmath0 m bands",
    ", we provide coadded mosaics of the entire xfls data sets along with the corresponding coverage maps and uncertainty images .",
    "the mosaics are from the filtered products and have been background subtracted . the absolute level of the uncertainty image has been scaled to match the empirical noise within the mosaics .",

    "the 70@xmath0 m image has gaps in the south - west corner of the mosaic due to non - overlapping aors .",
    "the 160@xmath0 m mosaics have a regular pattern of low coverage due to the unusable block of five detectors and the low redundancy of these observations .",
    "point - source catalogs were made for sources with s / n@xmath39 at each wavelength to insure high reliability .",
    "sources near the edges or within regions of very low coverage were deleted from the public catalogs to avoid potentially spurious sources . in total , 687 70@xmath0 m sources ( table  2 ) and 207 160@xmath0 m sources ( table  3 ) are cataloged .",
