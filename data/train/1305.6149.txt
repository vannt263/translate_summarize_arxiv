    "moreover , the reflected intensity from liquid surface / interface drops drastically with increase in angle hence a synchrotron beam is preferred .",
    "unfortunately , synchrotron beams are usually fixed in direction and need to incline by bragg - reflection using suitable single - crystal .",
    "usually the deflector crystal is mounted at o , the center of the goniometer stage where the solid samples are mounted and the liquids are placed on an additional stage which can rotate about the vertical axis through o. the rotation of the deflector crystal about the direct beam ( @xmath98 , refer to fig .",

    ", the change in angle of incidence causes the point of incidence to shift hence for each angle the point of incidence ( the liquid stage as a whole ) has to be brought back to its original position .",
    "now , the locus of the beam on a virtual cylinder ( @xmath103 : defined by the rotation of the liquid stage about the vertical axis through o ) of radius d is given by @xmath104 + 2y^2+z^2=d^2 $ ] .",
    "if a rotation of the deflector crystal by an amount @xmath93 brings the horizontal beam @xmath105 to @xmath106 which makes an angle @xmath94 with horizontal ( x - y ) plane then considering the vertical shift on a virtual vertical plane ( not on the cylindrical surface ) , one can write , @xmath107 which relates the angle of incidence , @xmath94 to the rotation of the crystal through the relation @xmath95 .",
