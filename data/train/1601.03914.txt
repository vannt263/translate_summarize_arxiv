    "the inter - layer spin - flip tunnelings are negligible under current experimental conditions , therefore they are neglected in fig .",

    "we first consider homogeneous fermi gases to give the simplest qualitative picture of the bilayer system . at this point ,",
    "the physics of the single - particle hamiltonian is simple in momentum space using a fourier decomposition .",
    "the four - band structure of the bilayer system is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c , d ) .",
    "obviously , the in - plane zeeman field @xmath44 leads to a fermi surface without inversion symmetry and gives a so - called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state with a finite total momentum pairing @xcite , but can not open a band gap at the dirac point , as shown in fig .",
    "for the realization of topological phase , a perpendicular zeeman field is needed to break the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry and open a topological band gap . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we report that the topological band gaps occur at the dirac point @xmath45 induced by increasing @xmath46 , which are similar to the single - layer mechanism .",
    "the superfluid pairing is between atoms with opposite momentum @xmath47 and @xmath48 without in - plane zeeman field @xmath44 .",
    "a critical observation is that when the zeeman field is larger than the tunneling effect @xmath49 , the increasing zeeman field removes the level crossing and open a gap between the two middle branches , as shown by the red curves in the fig .",
    "1(c , d ) .",
    "we will give a detailed discussion in the mean - field formalism .",
    "we consider the most simplified form of interactions with superfluid pairing formed between atoms with opposite momentum ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) . within the mean - field approximation ,",

    "the solutions for the zeeman field are @xmath71 here we just consider the parallel case @xmath72 . if there is no tunneling between two layers , the critical zeeman field reduces to the well - known @xmath73 , which has been discussed in detail in earlier works @xcite . the system will be in a conventional superfluid at @xmath74 and in a topological superfluid at @xmath75 . unlike the conventional phase transition in a single layer system , the tunneling shifts the chemical potential and gives two critical zeeman fields : @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( or exchange to assure @xmath78 ) .",
    "the system undergoes a tqpt when the zeeman field cross these two critical values , where the single - particle excitation gap vanishes , representing a topological phase transition . to see the phase transitions more clearly",
    ", we give the spin population at @xmath79 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . here",
    "we define the spin vector expectation value along the @xmath80-axis as @xmath81 we find that @xmath82 changes discontinuously when the zeeman field crosses the critical values @xmath83 $ ] , which implies the change of the topology of the spin texture .",
    "@xmath84 if @xmath85 , which corresponds to the trivial state , while @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 denote diverse topological states , as show in fig .",
    "therefore we give a classification of topological superfluid phases according to the strength of perpendicular zeeman field @xmath46 : @xmath90 where the last condition @xmath91 in the topological regimes ensures the bulk quasi - particle excitations are gapped to protect the zero - energy mfs .",
    "the region for topological superfluid depends not only on the chemical potential , pairing strength , but also on the tunneling strength .",
    "it provides more control knobs for tuning the topological phase transition .",
    "especially when the tunneling can be comparable to the chemical potential , the perpendicular zeeman field threshold can be dramatically lowered .",
    "these new features may open a possibility for the experimental realization of topological superfluid under small zeeman field .      to better understand the transition from one state to another defined by equation ( [ equ : gapclosecondition ] ) , it is necessary to observe the close and reopen of the excitation gap @xmath92 , which change the topology of fermi surface .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane of the order parameter and the perpendicular zeeman field is presented in fig .",
    "the graph is colored according to the energy gap @xmath92 , and white dotted curves mark contours of @xmath93 .",
    "there are three different topological regions determined by the behavior of the energy gap .",
    "the system is topological trivial at first , as increasing the zeeman field with a fixed @xmath94 , the band gap may first close and then reopen , signifying the transition from non - topological to @xmath95 superfluid ( @xmath96 $ ] ) , and finally undergoes a topological phase transition from @xmath95 to @xmath97 phase at the second gapless point @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "2(b - f ) , we plot the band gap and energy spectrums to illustrate the tqpt when @xmath99 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the range of region : @xmath95 is highly dependent on the value of order parameter @xmath94 , the increasing of the intensity of @xmath94 rapidly shrinks this region .    as have discussed the evolution of the single - particle hamiltonian as a function of @xmath46 , here we can further more rigorously demonstrate the topological phase transition with the change of the chemical potential @xmath25 .",
    "we can sketch the phase diagram in the fig .",
    "3(a ) , which shows perfect inversion symmetry ( @xmath100 ) in the @xmath101 plane . for a small order parameter ,",
    "the important feature is that there have four topological transition points along the change of the chemical potential .",
    "similar to the case in fig .",
    "2 , by tuning through the transition point , the quasi - particle excitation gap closes and open again , thus we can discriminate five regions in accordance with the topological condition ( [ equ : gapclosecondition ] ) with central area being @xmath97 .",
    "we can write down the scaling forms of the critical chemical potentials @xmath102 which can be easily got from the gap closing condition ( 9 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the range of central region @xmath97 gets shrink by increasing @xmath94 and turn into trivial phase above a threshold : @xmath103 . by further increasing the intensity of the order parameter beyond @xmath104 , the inequality @xmath105 holds at any @xmath25 ,",
    "thus there is only trivial phase region in this situation .",
    "the evolvement of band gap @xmath92 is plotted as the change of chemical potential in fig .",
    "there are five phases and separated by the critical values of the chemical potential @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "it can be better understood by observing change of the topology of fermi surface in the single - particle dispersion ( shown in fig .",
    "there have three gaps between branches under the condition @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath25 lies in the lowest gap , the system exhibits a single pair of fermi points as desired .",
    "the increase of @xmath25 tunes the system from @xmath95 to @xmath97 then back to @xmath95 by crossing the critical points between gaps , as shown in fig .3(b ) .      to confirm the topological phase transition and observe the appearance of zero - energy mf mode under some appropriate parameter condition",
    ", we take into account the trapping potential that is necessary to prevent the atoms from escaping . within the lda",
    ", the chemical potential can be thought of as a position dependent function : @xmath108 , that continuously decreases away from the center of the trap .",
    "therefore , the critical zeeman field can be accordingly redefined as @xmath109 both the local pairing gap and chemical potential decrease away from the trap center . at a small field @xmath46 , @xmath110 for any position and",
    "the whole fermi cloud is in the conventional superfluid .",
    "meanwhile , the condition @xmath111 may be always satisfied at an even large zeeman field .",
    "we can tune the system through an intermediate mixed phase in which topological trivial and non - trivial phase can co - exist .",
    "the mixed phases which appeare naturally in the parabolic trap potential , are illustrated in fig .",
    "4(a1,b1,c1 ) .",
    "we first consider setting the central chemical potential @xmath112 at a point above all zeeman gaps that four transition points are all covered by the position - dependent chemical potential ( shown in fig .",
    "there are five districts along with continuously decrease of the chemical potential from the middle of the trap towards the flanks .",
    "if we lower down the chemical potential , less transition points are covered and less topological phases can be distinguished ( see fig .",
    "4(b1,c1 ) ) .",
    "all we discussed just depend on the starting point of the chemical potential .",
    "the number of the majorana zero - energy modes is decided by the amount of spatial interfaces between the different phases discussed above .",
    "the mf is a half of an ordinary fermion and must always come in pairs .",
    "each of the paired states , localized in real space , can be hardly pushed away from @xmath113 by a local perturbation , giving rise to the intrinsic topological stability enjoyed by mfs .",
    "here we use the numerical method and solve self - consistent bdg equation in real space to explore the mf physics beyond the lda . in the presence of a trap @xmath114 , the bdg equation in real space can be written as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 @xmath117^{t}$ ] are the nambu spinor wave functions corresponding to the quasi - particle excitation energy @xmath118 .",

    "similar to the intrinsic symmetry built in the bdg hamiltonian in momentum space , @xmath128 is invariant under the particle - hole transformation : @xmath129 and @xmath130 . to remove",
    "this redundancy , a factor of @xmath131 has appeared in the above expressions . due to @xmath132 , we will immediately have @xmath133 , a zero - energy quasi - particle being its own antiparticle , exactly the defining feature of a mf .",
    "it is straightforward to show from the bdg hamiltonian that the wave function of mfs should satisfy either @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "we self - consistently solve the gap equation and the number equation for different total number of particles .",
    "@xmath136 is set to assure the trap oscillation frequency is much smaller than the recoil frequency .",
    "commonly , we use a dimensionless interaction parameter , @xmath137 , to characterize the interaction strength , where @xmath138 is the zero - temperature center density of an ideal fermi gas .",
    "the typical interaction strength is about @xmath139 and we take @xmath140 in our calculations . we have been taken @xmath141 harmonic oscillators as the expansion functions and find that @xmath142 is large enough to ensure the accuracy of the calculations .    by varying the zeeman field @xmath46 while keeping the chemical potential fixed in the middle of the gap , this way has been proved to be a conventional tool in experiments . alternatively , changing the number of particles while keeping the zeeman field fixed",
    "will have the same effect .",
    "4(a2,b2,c2 ) show the mean - field results of energy spectrum with different total particle number .",
    "the emergence of mfs can be clearly revealed by the behavior of the energy spectrum . at a large total particle number @xmath143 , eight majorana zero - energy modes associated with the presence of phase transitions ,",
    "appear in the middle of the gap ( seen in fig .",
    "the number of mfs changes as the total number of atoms varies .",
    "we could have six ( fig .",
    "4(b2 ) ) or four ( fig .",
    "4(c2 ) ) and even less mfs corresponding to what we have discussed in fig .",
    "4(b1,c1 ) . in fig . 5",
    ", we give a calculation of @xmath144 for a local uniform cell at position @xmath145 with the local chemical potential @xmath146 and order parameter @xmath147 .",
    "the local uniform cell would be in the @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) state if @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) and the fermi cloud is in the conventional superfluid with @xmath152 for any other position @xmath145 .",
    "these areas are highlighted by different colors . at a total particle number @xmath143 , there are six districts of topological state and therefore we can find four pairs of mfs over the whole system . by decreasing the total number , the conventional area at the trap center",
    "gets shrunk and eventually disappears at about @xmath153 , three pairs of mfs get preserved .",
    "it is obvious that less mfs remain if we future decrease the total number ( see fig .",
    "5(b , c ) ) .",
    "zero - energy modes just locate around the place with @xmath154 , corresponding to the steep slope of the order parameter .",
    "the agreement between bdg and lda result is reasonable .",
    "both theories predict multi - shell structures .",
    "their spatial variation clearly identifies that .",
    "in this work , we investigate the topological properties of bilayer fermi gases in the presence of so coupling . two diverse topological phases with @xmath155 are observed and connected by the tqrt , which have not been discovered previously .",
    "the topological structure of such system , whether it can be topological trivial or topological non - trivial , depend on not only the combined effect of so coupling and the zeeman field , but also the inter - layer tunneling , thus offering more tunability in experiments .",
    "we give the reliable results by solving the self - consistent bdg equation within a harmonic trap and predict that one can manipulate numerous majorana zero energy modes associated with interfaces between diverse phases by reforming the phase geometric construction of the system .",
    "our results also can be applicable to two dimensional topological superfluids .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the chern number that denotes the topology of the matter , and can be used to further test the concept behind our studies .",
    "the bilayer fermi gases with so coupling described here offer an practically realizable platform for further experiments to investigate the topological superfluid and realize and manipulate mfs , providing new insights into quantum computation .",
    "we work in a complete basis of single - particle wave functions in the harmonic trap @xmath156 with energy @xmath157 , @xmath158 here @xmath159 is the hermite polynomial , @xmath160 is the characteristic harmonic oscillator length .",
    "note that spin - orbit coupling working at these basis becomes @xmath161 .",
    "then we expand the normalized wave functions as @xmath162 , @xmath163 . according to the orthonormality relation @xmath164",
    ", we reduce the bdg equation to a matrix diagonalization problem , @xmath165 where the matrix elements are @xmath166 due to the normalization of the quasi - particle wavefunctions , the coefficients of the eigenstate must satisfy the condition @xmath167 .",
    "the same procedure also reduces the order parameter to @xmath168 and the local - density equations @xmath169 the above equations must be solved together by means of an iterative procedure , which starts from trial functions ( @xmath121 , @xmath25 ) and converges to the self - consistent solution .",
    "all sums in the equations are limited by an energy cutoff @xmath170 .",
    "this cutoff is required in order to cure the ultraviolet divergences . during the iteration , the order parameters @xmath121",
    "are updated , and the chemical potential @xmath25 is also adjusted slightly to enforce the number - conversation condition . the self - consistent iterative procedure is over until final convergence is reached .",

    "<S> the so - called majorana fermions ( mfs ) @xcite , accompanied with topological states , have a good prospect for applications in topological quantum computation , quantum memory and quantum random - number generation @xcite since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence caused by local perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> due to such potential applications , the realization of topological states in a well - controlled environment is highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several theoretically predictions and experimentally observations of topological states have been reported in a variety of systems , for example , inas wires and banded carbon nanotubes engineered by spin - orbit coupling of electrons @xcite , the surface of topological insulators @xcite , ultracold atomic gases with strong non - abelian synthetic gauge field @xcite and so on . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit ( so ) coupling plays a key role in all systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the other physical contexts , ultracold atomic gases with more experimental controls over its parameters , such as high controllability in interatomic interaction , geometry , purity , etc , offer an exceptional clean platform for exploring the topological superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental progresses in the synthetic so coupling of ultracold bose gases @xcite and fermi gases @xcite have stimulated a lot of interest in exploring exotic topological quantum properties of ultracold atoms . in particular , by deforming the fermi surface and opening a topological band gap , so coupled fermi gases become topological and support majorana zero - energy excitations in the presence of a large perpendicular zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on these experiments , the existence of a topological band gap can only lead to a single topological phase and a pair of majorana zero modes associated with topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong requirement in the realm of quantum information and quantum memory for proposing a advanced system , which results in more types of topological phases , to create and manipulate multiple mfs . to achieve this </S>",

    "<S> . it would be interesting to examine the possibility for realizing and manipulating multiple mfs by loading so coupled fermi gases in a bilayer structure , providing a peculiar insight into the topological states . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we concentrate on the potential topological properties of bilayer fermi gases with so coupling and predict the existence of multiple majorana zero states at the interfaces between distinct phases . the bilayer geometry can be readily realized by adding a two - dimensional double - well optical lattice , and the atoms in each layer are affected by the same raman so coupling , while coupled with each other via the inter - layer tunneling . notably different from previous mean field studies , by tunning the inter - layer tunneling , traditional topological phase condition induced by the collective effect of so coupling and zeeman field is shifted and causes two critical transition points [ @xmath1,@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the topological phase region becomes separated into two parts : topo- and topo- phases . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide a physical picture to classify the two different topological phases and discover that in suitable parameter regions , the system may undergo a unique tqpt from a topo- state to a topo- state , which has not been previously identified . </S>",
    "<S> the region for topological superfluid depends on not only magnitude of the zeeman field , the chemical potential , the so coupling strength , but also on the inter - layer tunneling , thus provides more knobs in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we give the self - consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) results of the system trapped in a harmonic potential and discuss the resulting multiple majorana zero - energy modes in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> the number of exotic majorana zero modes depends on the number of interfaces between distinct phases that form in different areas of the trap , which are consistent with analytical local - density approximation ( lda ) expressions . </S>",
    "<S> such so coupled bilayer fermi gases offer an opportunity to create and manipulate multi - mfs and a advanced multi - layer experimental setup may be therefore improved to measure more mfs . </S>"
