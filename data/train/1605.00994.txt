    "<S> we investigate weyl semimetals with tilted conical bands in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> even when the cones are overtilted ( type - ii weyl semimetal ) , landau - level quantization can be possible as long as the magnetic field is oriented close to the tilt direction . </S>",
    "<S> most saliently , the tilt can be described within the relativistic framework of lorentz transformations that give rise to a rich spectrum , displaying new transitions beyond the usual dipolar ones in the optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we identify particular features in the latter that allow one to distinguish between semimetals of different types .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of massless ultrarelativistic electrons in graphene @xcite has triggered a tremendous interest in novel types of semimetallic phases in condensed - matter systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly intriguing class is that of electronic systems with tilted dirac cones that were first investigated in the framework of the quasi - twodimensional ( 2d ) organic crystal @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to graphene where the dirac cones are situated at high - symmetry points @xcite , tilted dirac cones in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2  arise and migrate in wavevector space as a function of pressure applied to the system . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most remarkable consequences of the tilt is unveiled in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the tilt renormalizes the cyclotron frequency by the same factor as an inplane electric field @xmath4 that was investigated in a covariant description by lukose et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hints at an intimate relation between the tilt of the dirac cones and relativistic transformations that was later investigated in the framework of magnetotransport @xcite and magnetooptics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one may naturally ask what happens when the dirac cones are _ overtilted _ such that the original reciprocal isoenergy trajectories are no longer closed ellipses but open hyperbolas @xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , the tilted dirac cones may be characterized with the help of lorentz transformations . as we discuss in more detail below </S>",
    "<S> , this can be achieved if one identifies the tilt with an effective electric field @xmath4 . below the critical tilt , </S>",
    "<S> we are confronted with a `` weak '' electric field that allows for a lorentz boost to a frame of reference where @xmath4 effectively vanishes . in this so - called _ magnetic regime _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the electronic orbits are then still closed ( cyclotron orbits ) and their energy is quantized into landau level ( lls ) @xcite . in contrast , such a boost is not possible for overtilted cones that corresponds to a `` strong '' electric field . via a lorentz transformation </S>",
    "<S> , one can now simply find a frame of reference where the @xmath3-field vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this _ electric regime _ is characterized by open orbits that prevent ll quantization . whereas overtilted cones have not been found in 2d materials , following the proposal by soluyanov et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , several 3d systems have been identified during the last months as possible candidates for representing such phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these phases , coined type - ii weyl semimetals ( wsm ) , have been classified from a topological point of view @xcite .    in the present paper , we show that the above classification needs to be revisited in 3d systems that present a remarkably rich behavior . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that a type - ii wsm can undergo a transition from the magnetic to the electric regime as a function of the angle between the magnetic field and the tilt direction . whereas the electric regime is at first sight the natural regime of a type - ii wsm , the latter can nevertheless show ll quantization  </S>",
    "<S> the tilt is then most prominent in the direction of the @xmath3-field , and the original overtilt is well represented by a onedimensional band in the latter direction . </S>",
    "<S> this situation needs to be contrasted with that of at type - i wsm that is always in the magnetic regime regardless of the @xmath3-field direction . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can , at least in principle , induce transitions between wsm of the two different types by the application of an additional electric field with a nonzero component perpendicular to the @xmath3-field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate in detail the magneto - optical signatures in the magnetic regime , which allow for a distinction between type - i and type - ii wsm . </S>",
    "<S> most saliently , we find , similarly to tilted dirac cones in 2d materials @xcite , that a magnetic field applied in a direction different from the tilt yields magnetooptical transitions beyond the usual dipolar ones that couple lls with adjacent indices , @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> .    tilted dirac cones in 3d systems can be modeled conveniently by the hamiltonian @xmath6 in terms of the three pauli matrices @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath8 ) and the anisotropic fermi velocities @xmath9 . here and </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we use a system of units where @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we combine the tilt velocities @xmath11 into the tilt parameter vector @xmath12 which allows us to distinguish a type - i wsm ( @xmath13 ) from a type - ii wsm ( @xmath14 ) , in analogy with the 2d case @xcite . in order to account for a magnetic field in the @xmath15-direction </S>",
    "<S> , we use the peierls substitution @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as a consequence of the @xmath19-dependence of the vector potential , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20- and @xmath21 components of the new momenta become operators that no longer commute , @xmath22= -i\\mathrm{sign } ( v_xv_yb)/l_b^2 $ ] , in terms of the magnetic length @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we consider the tilt to have no component in the @xmath21-direction  this can always be achieved via a rotation and a possible rescaling of the momenta  and the hamiltonian thus reads ( see supplementary material ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average fermi velocity in the @xmath26-plane , and @xmath27 is a rescaled tilt velocity .    while the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) can in principle , within a lengthy calculation , be solved by the introduction of the usual ladder operators @xmath28 , similarly to the 2d case @xcite , a more elegant method consists of using a hyperbolic transformation to change the eigenvalue equation @xmath29 into @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a normalization constant required since the hyperbolic transformation does not preserve the norm of the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation is nothing other than a lorentz boost in the @xmath20-direction in terms of the relativistic parameter @xmath33 @xcite , which reads @xmath34 in the magnetic regime ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 in the electric regime ( @xmath37 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in the introduction , only the magnetic regime allows for quantized lls , and we concentrate henceforth on this regime . in the transformed frame of reference , the eigenvalue equation ( [ wsma ] ) reads @xmath38    |\\tilde{\\psi}\\rangle = 0 ,      \\label{mal}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the dilatation factor . </S>",

    "<S> [ figsc ] for a type - i wsm [ panel ( a ) ] and a type - ii wsm [ panel ( b ) ] in the magnetic regime . </S>",
    "<S> one retrieves the known 2d results for @xmath66 @xcite , i.e. a graphene - like ll spectrum with @xmath67 , where the spacing is reduced by the relativistic factor @xmath68 . in the 3d case , these lls evolve into 1d bands with a dispersion in @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely this dispersion that bares information about the underlying wsm type since their bands are also tilted and can be seen as gapless ( @xmath70 ) or gapped ( @xmath71 ) dirac cones with a tilt below ( type - i ) or above ( type - ii ) the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> their tilt is characterized by the 1d tilt parameter @xmath72 , in terms of the velocity @xmath73 , @xmath74 one thus finds that for any angle @xmath0 one has @xmath75 for a type - i and @xmath76 for a type - ii wsm , i.e. the type of the 1d bands is the same as the original 3d wsm in the absence of a magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> a naturally arising question is whether one can also induce a transition from the magnetic to the electric regime in a type - i wsm . from a theoretical point of view , this can in principle be achieved by an electric field with a nonzero component perpendicular to @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider for simplicity an electric field @xmath4 in the @xmath21-direction that yields a supplementary term @xmath78 to hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) . in the landau gauge @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> , the modified hamiltonian reads @xmath80 , where @xmath81 has the same structure as eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) if we replace the tilt velocity @xcite @xmath82 or equivalently the tilt parameter @xmath83 , with @xmath84 a type - i wsm can therefore undergo a transition from the magnetic to the electric regime for a judicious choice of the electric field if the criterion ( [ eq : critang ] ) is satisfied in terms of the tilt parameter @xmath85 , inducing a breakdown of the ll spectrum @xcite . from an experimental point of view , however , the situation is more involved because of the screening of the electric field due to free carriers both in the bulk and at the surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> further studies are thus required to establish the feasibility of such experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> we show however that distinctive signatures of type - i and type - ii wsm are clearly accessible in magnetooptical ( reflectivity ) experiments @xcite in the magnetic regime , with no electric field involved . within linear - response theory , </S>",
    "<S> the reflection of light at a polarization @xmath86 is proportional to the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath87\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_{j j'})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath88 denote the quantum numbers @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the quantum of conductance , and @xmath91 is the energy difference between the final and initial states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath92 is the fermi - dirac distribution for a fermi level that we choose at zero energy ( at the position of the weyl point ) and the matrix element is given by @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula is integrated analytically for two elliptic polarizations ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most salient features of the matrix elements in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : reop ] ) is related to the nonorthogonality of the spinor components as a consequence of the relativistic boost @xcite , i.e. when @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the harmonic - oscillator wave functions acquire an energy - dependent shift in their position due to the lorentz transformation , which thus yields energy - dependent overlap functions ( see supplementary material ) . as a consequence , the usual dipolar selection @xmath5 are violated , and as a function of @xmath95 additional interband peaks arise in the optical conductivity at energies @xmath96 this is shown in fig . [ peaks ] for a type - i [ panel ( a ) ] and a type - ii wsm [ panel ( b ) ] , where we depict the optical conductivity as a function of frequency for several values of @xmath95 . for @xmath97 , one retrieves the typical spectrum of a wsm discussed in the literature @xcite , where the peaks have the usual @xmath98 divergence due to the 1d character of the ll bands as a function of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> these are also visible at @xmath99 and are the main difference with respect to the 2d case discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the optical conductivity of an undoped type - ii wsm shows additional peaks at low energies that are due to allowed transitions between lls of the same original band . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , lls corresponding to the family @xmath100 , which are always at positive energies in a type - i wsm , have parts of bands situated at negative energies , whereas those of with @xmath101 become positive for certain values of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , transitions between lls of the same family [ red arrows in the inset of panel ( a ) ] are no longer blocked by the pauli principle and contribute to the optical conductivity up to the energy @xmath102 this yields the unusually large optical conductivity at low frequency and reflects the large density of states of a type - ii wsm at zero @xmath3-field , in comparison with a type - i wsm . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is different from that previously described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a type - i wsm where low - frequency peaks in the optical conductivity are obtained upon doping , whereas here the system is undoped .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that 3d wsm show a rich variety of phases in the presence of a magnetic field that unveil the underlying relativistic symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to 2d systems , the magnetic and the electric regimes , with and without ll quantization , respectively , do no longer coincide with the type of the wsm in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a type - ii wsm can show ll quantization as long as the angle between the tilt direction and the magnetic field satisfies the condition ( [ eq : critang])in this case , the type - ii character is visible in the 1d landau bands as a function of the wave vector @xmath69 in the direction of the @xmath3-field . </S>",
    "<S> most saliently , we have shown that the relativistic parameter @xmath95 has a clear fingerprint in the optical conductivity , which can be probed in magnetooptical measurements , discerning different types of wsm . </S>",
    "<S> we would finally emphasize that our results are readily generalized to the case of a pair ( or more ) of weyl points in a more realistic band structure . if the two cones are related by a discrete symmetry ( e.g. time reversal ) , the tilts of the two cones are in opposite directions . in this case , one obtains two copies of the same ll spectrum , since the parameter @xmath95 depends only on the modulus of the tilt vector @xmath103 . for more pairs of weyl points , the tilt vectors are no longer necessarily of the same modulus , and the condition ( [ eq : critang ] ) for the transition between magnetic and electric regime </S>",
    "<S> is then not unique for all points . during the writing of the present paper , we became aware of two other preprints on magnetic - field properties of type - ii wsm . </S>",
    "<S> the findings of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are similar to ours but the authors consider only the optical conductivity for @xmath97 , i.e. when the tilt is in the same direction as the @xmath3-field , in which case one has no violation of the dipolar selection rule @xmath5 and no renormalization of the ll spacing . </S>",
