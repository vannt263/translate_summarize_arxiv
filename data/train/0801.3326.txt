    "flux compactifications of string theory ( for reviews see @xcite ) populate large parts of the string landscape , and may describe our universe .",
    "however , the theoretical basis for the construction of these compactifications is still far from rigorous ( see @xcite for criticism ) , and is based on using low - energy supergravity actions in a regime which is different from the flat - space regime where they are usually derived from string theory .",
    "it would be very interesting if a non - perturbative construction of some flux compactifications could be found , providing further support for their consistency , and perhaps leading to new methods for their analysis .",
    "a promising arena for such a construction is in flux compactifications involving four dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "such compactifications are dual , by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , to three dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "thus , understanding the three dimensional conformal field theory dual to some @xmath0 flux compactification would give a non - perturbative definition for that background .",
    "eventually we would like to study the statistics of conformal field theories that are dual to @xmath0 backgrounds , in order to learn about statistics of flux compactifications , and to try to understand how to describe also backgrounds with a positive cosmological constant .    for general flux compactifications",
    ", it seems that understanding the dual conformal field theory must be very complicated ( see @xcite for attempts in this direction ) .",
    "this is because the cosmological constant of the resulting background , which is related to the central charge of the dual conformal field theory , depends in a very complicated way on the fluxes , and it seems that extremely complicated dynamics is needed to reproduce this on the field theory side .",
    "the situation seems to be much simpler in the type iia flux compactifications constructed in @xcite ( these solutions were further analyzed from the ten dimensional point of view in @xcite ) .",
    "these backgrounds have a `` large - flux limit '' in which some of the fluxes ( the three four - form fluxes @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are taken to be large , such that in that limit the cosmological constant becomes small , the string coupling becomes weak , and the compact space becomes large .",
    "this means that these backgrounds can reliably be studied in the supergravity approximation ( except perhaps near the orientifold where the string coupling may be large ) , and that in the `` large - flux limit '' the properties of the dual conformal field theories depend in a simple way on the fluxes .",
    "one can then hope to reproduce this simple dependence in some field theoretic model .",
    "a first attempt at such an analysis , in a different `` large - flux limit '' which does not lead to a weakly coupled string theory ( not all four - form fluxes are taken to be large ) appeared in @xcite ; we will attempt here to describe the field theories appearing in the generic `` large - flux limit '' , which is described by a weakly coupled string theory .",
    "the naive way to construct a field theory dual for flux backgrounds is to imagine constructing the flux gradually from branes carrying that flux , in a manner similar to that in which the @xmath5 background of string theory is constructed from d3-branes in flat space . in particular , the 4-form fluxes @xmath6 in our background are carried by d4-branes wrapped on 2-cycles in the compact space , and it is natural to imagine building the background from such d4-branes @xcite .",
    "it is certainly possible to go from a background with a large flux ( which is already a weakly coupled weakly curved background ) to a background with an even larger flux by adding such branes , and we will use this in our discussion of the moduli space of the conformal field theory .",
    "however , it is not clear if one can construct the full theory from such branes , since in the limit of a small flux the background becomes not only strongly curved ( this happens also for d3-branes ) but also strongly coupled .",
    "nevertheless , it is still natural to guess that the dual conformal field theory arises from some decoupled low - energy theory living on three sets of d4-branes .",
    "however , we will find that assuming that the degrees of freedom in this theory are weakly coupled open strings ( in adjoint and bi - fundamental representations of the resulting @xmath7 gauge theory ) leads to a contradiction , since the central charge of the dual conformal field theory ( which scales as @xmath8 , as we will compute in section [ sec : dual - cft ] ) grows faster than the number of such degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the field theory must be more complicated than the naive theory of open strings , perhaps involving a larger gauge group , or @xcite fields in multi - fundamental or other higher representations , or perhaps not coming from any gauge theory at all .    in order to find clues about this mysterious field theory we investigate in some detail its moduli space , which can be described using configurations of domain walls in @xmath0 . of course , generic flux backgrounds preserve no supersymmetry so they would not be expected to have a moduli space .",
    "the flux backgrounds of @xcite preserve a four dimensional @xmath9 supersymmetry , so they are dual to three dimensional @xmath9 superconformal field theories .",
    "this amount of supersymmetry is not enough to protect the moduli space from quantum corrections , since generic scalar potentials are consistent with three dimensional @xmath9 supersymmetry .",
    "nevertheless , in our study ( performed in the weak coupling weak curvature limit ) we will find a large moduli space in these backgrounds .",
    "we expect this moduli space to be lifted by quantum corrections ( perhaps non - perturbative ) , but these quantum corrections are small in the `` large flux limit '' , and we expect the existence of a moduli space in this limit to be a useful clue for the construction of the dual field theory .",
    "the moduli space turns out to be very complicated , with many different branches that may be interconnected .",
    "for each such branch we employ some mathematical theorems that count the number of solutions of polynomial equations , in order to compute its dimension .",
    "we will show that for large values of the fluxes , the dimension of the moduli space scales as @xmath10 .",
    "the effective field theory at generic points on the moduli space includes @xmath11 gauge fields , scalars and fermions ; however , in @xmath12 dimensions a @xmath11 gauge field is equivalent to a compact scalar , so the presence of these gauge fields does not necessarily imply that the full theory is related to a @xmath13 gauge theory .",
    "however , there are special submanifolds of the moduli space in which we can see gauge groups corresponding to all subgroups of @xmath13 , suggesting that the conformal field theory may be described as the low - energy limit of some gauge theory which includes this gauge group .",
    "this is further supported by the scaling of the dimension of the moduli space , that is reminiscent of strings in the bi - fundamental representation of each pair of gauge groups ( and such bi - fundamental fields indeed appear on the special submanifolds mentioned above ) .",
    "so far we have not been able to find a simple field theory model that would reproduce all the properties that we find ; in particular it seems hard to explain the large number of degrees of freedom , and the complicated form of the moduli space .",
    "we hope that these properties will provide useful clues for the construction of such a field theory in the future .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : supergravity - model ] with a review of the type iia backgrounds of @xcite that we will be studying and of their supersymmetry equations . in section [ sec : dual - cft ]",
    "we compute various basic properties of the dual field theory , like its central charges and the generic features of its operator spectrum . in section [ sec : domain - walls ] we consider branes spanning domain walls in the @xmath0 space , and find the condition that they preserve supersymmetry .",
    "we then go on in section [ sec : geom - moduli - space ] to study the structure of their moduli space .",
    "we compute the moduli space explicitly for a simple example and find some properties , such as the dimension , for the generic case . in the appendices we include some additional calculations , including an explicit calculation of the supersymmetry in the bulk in appendix [ sec : supersymm - equat - bulk ] . in appendix [",
    "sec : bps - condition ] we show that the domain walls found in section [ sec : domain - walls ] obey the bps condition , and in appendix [ sec : other - domain - walls ] we consider the possibility of additional domain wall brane configurations .",
    "in this section we review the low - energy limit of the background of massive type iia string theory described by an orientifold of type iia string theory on @xmath14 .",
    "this model was studied extensively in @xcite , where it was shown that by turning on generic values for the background fluxes it is possible to stabilize all moduli without the use of non - perturbative effects .",
    "we will start by reviewing the geometrical properties of the compact manifold , and then discuss the possible moduli and the way in which they can be stabilized .",
    "finally we will show that the background satisfies the supersymmetry equations in the bulk .",
    "the compact space is an orbifold of @xmath15 .",
    "we parameterize the torus by the three complex coordinates @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .",
    "we take the complex structure moduli of the tori to be @xmath18 , so that the @xmath19 coordinates are periodic with the identifications @xmath20 at this point in the moduli space of the torus , the @xmath15 has a @xmath21 symmetry , under which the coordinates transform as @xmath22 it is then possible to orbifold by this symmetry .",
    "this gives rise to a singular space , with 27 singular points corresponding to the fixed points of the @xmath21 symmetry @xcite . after this identification",
    ", there is a second @xmath21 symmetry acting freely on the coordinates as @xmath23 this symmetry identifies triplets of fixed points , thus leading , after a second orbifold by the second @xmath21 symmetry , to a singular calabi - yau manifold with only 9 singular points ( that can be locally described as a @xmath24 singularity ) .",
    "the cohomology of this manifold is given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are therefore no complex structure moduli and 12 khler moduli .",
    "nine of them are associated to blow - up modes of the singular points , while the other three khler moduli describe the volume of the three tori .",
    "these volume moduli @xmath27 appear in the metric as @xmath28 or in the khler form for the manifold as @xmath29    it will be useful to write an explicit basis for the cohomology of the compact space .",
    "there are no one - forms , since the two @xmath21 orbifolds project out all of the one - forms of the torus .",
    "there are three two - forms that form the basis of the untwisted part of @xmath30 .",
    "these are the two - forms that remain invariant under the @xmath31 , and they can be chosen as @xmath32 in an arbitrary normalization ( in which the triple intersection is @xmath33 ) .",
    "their poincar - dual four - forms form the basis for the untwisted part of @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 are different elements of the set @xmath37 .",
    "we choose the normalizations such that @xmath38 there are also two - forms and four - forms associated with the blow - up modes of the orbifold fixed points , which we will not write down explicitly .    since @xmath25 ,",
    "the only 3-forms in the compact geometry are the holomorphic 3-form @xmath39 and its complex conjugate @xmath40 .",
    "these are normalized such that @xmath41 and can be verified to obey the standard relations @xmath42    as a last step in defining the geometry we quotient by an orientifold action .",
    "we will use the orientifold of @xmath14 presented in @xcite .",
    "the total orientifold action is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is reflection on the worldsheet , @xmath45 is the worldsheet left moving fermion number , and @xmath46 is the spacetime involution @xmath47 under this action there is a 3 dimensional space left fixed , given by @xmath48}=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , the theory contains an @xmath49-plane wrapping this 3-cycle and filling the non compact directions .    under the orientifold action the different forms have non trivial transformation properties .",
    "the forms defined above transform as @xmath50 one can write the three - forms in a diagonal basis with respect to the orientifold by decomposing @xmath44 to its real and imaginary parts , @xmath51 .",
    "these transform as @xmath52      in order to stabilize all the moduli we will need to turn on a 10-form ( or 0-form ) rr flux , so that in the low - energy limit we obtain romans massive iia supergravity theory @xcite ( with a mass parameter proportional to the rr 0-form field strength ) , compactified to four dimensions on the @xmath14 orientifold discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "in addition to the background metric and dilaton , the theory includes a ns - ns 2-form @xmath53 ( whose field strength is @xmath54 ) , and a rr 1-form and 3-form , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( with field strengths @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) . with respect to the standard convention , while working with signs as in @xcite .",
    "so , we use opposite signs for @xmath59 and @xmath60 compared to @xcite . ]    before turning on fluxes , the massless spectrum includes the khler parameters from the metric , @xmath27 , and the dilaton @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath53 is odd under @xmath44 , its zero modes are related to the forms @xmath62 in the @xmath46-odd cohomology @xmath63 , and it can be expanded as @xmath64 the three zero modes @xmath65 combine with @xmath27 to form the bosonic part of a chiral multiplet .",
    "similarly we can expand the rr forms .",
    "since @xmath66 , the one - form has no zero modes .",
    "the three - form , being even under @xmath44 , has one zero mode , related to the unique even three - form , @xmath67 .",
    "thus we have @xmath68 the four dimensional axiodilaton superfield contains the combination of this axion @xmath69 with the dilaton @xmath61 .",
    "all of these moduli can be stabilized by turning on fluxes along the compact directions . in order to preserve poincar invariance ,",
    "the fluxes can be written as @xmath70 where all the indices in @xmath71 and @xmath72 are internal , and they are poincar dual using the 6 dimensional metric , @xmath73 .",
    "the background values for the fluxes can then be written by expanding the fields in the relevant cohomology ( having the correct parity under the orientifold ) : @xmath74 they obey the following integrality condition @xmath75 so that the integer fluxes are related to the ones in ( [ eq:18 ] ) by @xmath76    we will split the field strengths into the background part and an excitations part .",
    "they can then be written as @xmath77 the background values of the fluxes are constrained by the tadpoles of the different fields .",
    "these were analyzed in @xcite , where it was found that there is a unique tadpole for @xmath78 which requires @xmath79 in terms of the integer fluxes ( [ eq:167 ] ) this means @xmath80 , so that there are four different possibilities , @xmath81 .",
    "all other fluxes are not constrained by tadpoles .",
    "the scalar potential was analyzed in detail in @xcite , and it was found that by turning on such fluxes @xmath82 the moduli are stabilized at values given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 ) . from the four dimensional point of view , this solution has a negative cosmological constant @xmath86 and we will consider the maximally symmetric solution of the resulting four dimensional action , which is given by @xmath87 .",
    "there are several things to note here regarding this solution . from supersymmetry",
    "we get ( see the next subsection ) a constraint on the signs of the fluxes @xmath88 which also guarantees that the @xmath27 and @xmath89 are real .",
    "when we take large values for the quantized fluxes , @xmath90 ( without making some of them much larger than the others ) , we get to a regime with large volume and weak coupling where we can trust our computation . throughout this paper",
    "we will work in this regime .",
    "we also note that there is a non - singular solution with @xmath91 , which has no 2-form and 6-form background fluxes .",
    "there are additional moduli localized near the @xmath24 singularities .",
    "one can turn on @xmath92 and @xmath93 fluxes on the corresponding localized cycles , which we denote , respectively , by @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 goes over the different singular points ) .",
    "the blow up khler modes @xmath97 are then stabilized at @xmath98 where we defined @xmath99 , and the integer @xmath100 is the non - trivial triple intersection of the twisted cycles .",
    "the values for @xmath101 and @xmath69 are modified by these additional fluxes ( the dilaton by a small amount when @xmath102 ) : @xmath103}^{1/2 }    \\cr    \\xi&=&\\frac1p { \\left(}e_0+\\frac{e_im_i+ \\sum_a f_an_a}{m_0}+\\frac{6\\kappa m_1m_2m_3+{\\beta}\\sum_an_a^3}{3m_0 ^ 2}{\\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this subsection we review how the background described above satisfies the supersymmetry equations .",
    "we will write the background as a warped product of a four - dimensional anti de - sitter space with @xmath14 , with the metric @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the warp factor , @xmath106 is the 4 dimensional ads metric and @xmath107 is the metric on @xmath14 .",
    "we will use the double spinor convention , which in type iia amounts to writing the majorana killing spinor as two majorana weyl spinors with opposite chirality , @xmath108 we can decompose the ten dimensional clifford algebra into the @xmath109 algebras in the following way , @xmath110 where the 4d gamma matrices are real and the 6d are purely imaginary and antisymmetric .",
    "we denote by underlined indices the tangent space flat indices .",
    "the killing spinors also decompose as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the unique covariantly constant spinor on the calabi - yau , while @xmath113 , @xmath114 ( with @xmath115 ) are the killing spinors on @xmath0 satisfying @xmath116 the complex number @xmath117 is the value of the superpotential , so that the cosmological constant of the @xmath0 space is given by @xmath118 .",
    "the spinor @xmath119 on the calabi - yau gives rise to an @xmath120 structure .",
    "following @xcite we can write the two pure spinors as bispinors of @xmath121 in the following way @xmath122 using the clifford map , there is a one - to - one correspondence between such bispinors and p - forms , given by @xmath123 using this map , the pure spinors can also be represented by the almost complex structure 2-form and the holomorphic 3-form , @xmath124    following these notations , the equations for preserved supersymmetry are given by @xcite @xmath125},\\\\    e^{-2a+\\phi}(d+h\\wedge)(e^{2a-\\phi}\\psi_-)&= & 3i{\\,\\mathcal{i}\\mathrm{m}\\!\\left[\\bar\\mu\\psi_+\\right ] }    + da\\wedge\\bar\\psi_-    \\cr & & + \\frac{\\sqrt2}{16}e^\\phi{\\left[}(|a|^2-|b|^2)\\hat f + i(|a|^2+|b|^2 )    \\tilde f{\\right ] } ,    \\cr&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 are the modified rr fields defined as @xmath127 so that they obey the non - standard bianchi identity @xmath128 .",
    "we solve these equations in appendix [ sec : supersymm - equat - bulk ] , finding that for supersymmetry to be preserved the killing spinors should have @xmath129 , and the moduli should obtain values as in ( [ eq:22 ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we described a solution of supergravity ( and , thus , of string theory ) that includes a four dimensional ads space . according to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , there is a three dimensional conformal field theory which is the holographic dual of this solution .",
    "many properties of this cft can be calculated in a simple manner from the supergravity solution .",
    "we will discuss these properties in this section , including the central charge , dimensions of operators and the global symmetries of the cft .",
    "we will also discuss d - branes wrapping cycles in the compact space to give particles or strings on @xmath0 . throughout this paper",
    "we will work only in the limit where all 4-form fluxes are large , so that the string coupling is weak and the supergravity approximation is good .",
    "we will begin by finding the central charge of the cft from the curvature of the ads space .",
    "there are various possible definitions of a central charge for three dimensional cfts , including the coefficient of the two - point function of the stress - energy tensor , and the coefficient multiplying the volume times the temperature squared in the entropy of the theory at finite temperature . in the gravity approximation ,",
    "all definitions give answers proportional to @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the four dimensional newton s constant , since this is the coefficient ( in units of @xmath132 ) of the four dimensional action , so that all correlation functions are proportional to this .",
    "using our formulas from the previous section , we have ( up to constants ) @xmath133 since the 3-form and 0-form fluxes are numbers of order one . in particular , if we take all the fluxes @xmath134 , we find a central charge scaling as @xmath135 ( this was independently noted in @xcite ) .    equation ( [ eq:173 ] ) is reminiscent of the formula for the central charge in the case of @xmath136 @xmath137 sym in 2 + 1 dimensions . in that case",
    "the central charge of the theory in the ir ( where it is dual to m theory on @xmath138 ) scales like @xmath139 ( which is not understood in terms of any effective field theory degrees of freedom ) . by analogy",
    ", this suggests that in our case there may be some @xmath140 , namely that if there is a uv description of any sort it should include an order of @xmath141 degrees of freedom .",
    "this is also suggested by the fact that these are the minimal integer powers which are larger than those appearing in the central charge ( [ eq:173 ] ) .",
    "this uv description could be for instance an @xmath142 gauge theory , or an @xmath143 gauge theory with matter in representations whose dimension is of order @xmath144 ( such representations are consistent with asymptotic freedom in @xmath12 dimensions ) .",
    "the analysis in @xcite give some support to this suggestion .",
    "it was argued there that after two t - dualities in the directions of the first 2-torus , and in the limit of @xmath145 , the background should be lifted to m theory , and resembles the near - horizon limit of @xmath2 m2-branes ( at some singularity ) . in this case",
    "we see that the degrees of freedom are renormalized from @xmath146 in the theory on some d2-branes ( at the same singularity ) to @xmath147 in the theory on the m2-branes .    below we will use another indicator for the number of branes in the problem which will be the structure ( and in particular the dimensionality ) of different branches of the moduli space .",
    "the moduli space will be made out of holomorphic ( in an appropriate sense ) d4-branes which wrap different 2-cycles of the torus .",
    "our analysis of the moduli space will be performed in the limit where all fluxes are large , but since it preserves some supersymmetry it is natural to expect that the same results for the form and dimension of the moduli space will hold also in other limits ( though we have not verified this directly ) . assuming this , we find ( using our results derived below ) that for the scaling of @xcite the dimension of the largest branch of the moduli space will scale like @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , this branch is described by the motion of d4-branes wrapping the first @xmath148 , which become m2-branes ( or d2-branes ) after 2 t - dualities .",
    "our more general analysis below will show that the dimension of the maximal branch of the moduli space scales like @xmath149 .",
    "the previous case is a special case of this .",
    "note that this might suggest that in a scaling limit in which two of the fluxes ( say , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) become large while the third remains finite , the theory resembles that of @xmath150 m2-branes . while the dimension of the moduli space and the number of degrees of freedom are consistent with this suggestion , the precise form of the moduli space is very different from what one would obtain from any theory of @xmath151 m2-branes .",
    "as described above , the supergravity solution preserves a four dimensional @xmath9 supersymmetry . by the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence this maps to a three dimensional @xmath9 superconformal symmetry , with two supersymmetry charges and two superconformal charges .    in the ads / cft correspondence , the global symmetries of the cft",
    "are related to gauge symmetries of the gravitational theory .",
    "such symmetries arise from reductions of the supergravity fields on the compact space ( or from space - filling d - branes ) .",
    "the simplest gauge fields are related to the ten dimensional metric , and are related to the isometry group of the compactification manifold . in our case",
    "the compact space is a calabi - yau manifold and thus has no isometry group .",
    "so , we do not get any gauge fields from the metric .",
    "in addition to the metric , the rr 1-form and 3-form can also give rise to gauge symmetries .",
    "in our background we have a non - trivial 0-form flux which gives a mass to the 1-form ( it is swallowed by the 2-form @xmath53 which becomes massive ) . thus , there is no gauge symmetry associated with the 1-form . in order to get a 1-form gauge field from the 3-form we need to integrate it over a 2-cycle .",
    "as the compactification manifold contains three such untwisted 2-cycles , we obtain three commuting gauge fields .",
    "however , since the 2-cycles are odd under the orientifolding , these gauge fields are projected out by the orientifold .",
    "the gauge fields arising from the twisted 2-cycles are similarly projected out .",
    "thus , the conformal field theory that we are looking for does not have any global symmetry ( beyond the @xmath9 superconformal algebra , which does not include any continuous r - symmetry group ) .",
    "another basic property of a conformal field theory is the spectrum of operators in the theory .",
    "the simplest operators are related to the supergravity fields , and their dimensions are related to the masses so we can easily find the spectrum .",
    "there are two mass scales for fields in the supergravity .",
    "the first is the mass of the moduli , which can be computed from their potential .",
    "this was written explicitly in @xcite for some of the moduli , and it is easy to see that the others have the same scaling . in units of the four dimensional planck scale @xmath152 the moduli masses",
    "are @xmath153 the other mass scale in supergravity is the mass of the kaluza - klein modes , given by the inverse radii of the compact tori , @xmath154 the dimensions of the corresponding operators are given using the ads / cft correspondence as @xmath155 thus , as in all other conformal field theories dual to theories with a four dimensional supergravity approximation ( implying a separation of scales between the moduli and the kk modes ) , there is a small number of operators with dimensions of order one , and all others have large dimensions .",
    "the order one operators correspond to the eight moduli fields , @xmath156 .",
    "another type of operators in the field theory involves d@xmath157-branes wrapped on @xmath157-cycles in the compact space , giving particles in the @xmath0 .",
    "since our background involves massive type iia string theory , we can not have any d0-branes ( which must have @xmath158 strings ending on them ) or d6-branes ( which must have @xmath158 ns 5-branes ending on them ) ; this is related to the fact that the rr 1-form is swallowed by the ns - ns 2-form . naively we can have wrapped d2-branes or d4-branes on our 2-cycles or 4-cycles , but in fact the orientifold maps these to anti - d - branes , so it is unlikely that any stable configurations of this type would exist .",
    "we can also consider a @xmath157-brane wrapping a @xmath159-cycle , leading to a string in @xmath0 ( mapped to some type of flux tube in the conformal field theory ) .",
    "the only such possible configurations are a d4-brane wrapping a 3-cycle and an ns5-brane wrapped on a 4-cycle .",
    "a d4-brane wrapped around the @xmath67 cycle is mapped to an anti - brane by the orientifold , while a d4-brane wrapping the @xmath160 cycle is not a consistent configuration , since there is @xmath54-flux on that 3-cycle , implying that such d4-branes must have d2-branes ending on them .",
    "the same phenomenon arises for ns5-branes wrapped on the 4-cycles , since these have 4-form flux .",
    "note that the fundamental string is also mapped to a string with opposite orientation by the orientifold .",
    "thus , we do not expect to have any stable extended objects in our theory .",
    "in the next two sections we wish to study the moduli space of the conformal field theory dual to the background described in section [ sec : supergravity - model ] . to describe the moduli space we need to find lorentz - invariant configurations with zero energy which have the same asymptotics as the solution described above , but differ in the interior . usually in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence such configurations are described by supersymmetric branes sitting at some value of the radial position , giving domain walls in ads along which the flux which the brane is charged under jumps . moving along the moduli space of these configurations",
    "is described in the field theory side as giving non - trivial vacuum expectation values to operators .",
    "such domain walls break half of the supersymmetry in the bulk ; in the conformal field theory they break the superconformal generators and preserve the standard supersymmetry generators .",
    "we will consider here d - brane domain walls , given by d@xmath157-branes wrapping @xmath161-cycles in the compact space , and sitting at fixed radial position in @xmath0 .",
    "for the configuration to be supersymmetric ( which is the same as having zero energy in the field theory ) these must obey some calibration condition @xcite .",

    "it is interesting from the point of view of the dual field theory to understand how the dimension of the moduli space scales as we take large wrapping numbers , @xmath377 ( which should still be much smaller than the fluxes since we are using the probe approximation ) . for this we will find the dimension of the maximal branch with given wrapping numbers",

    "since the @xmath372 s are positive , this give some non - trivial condition on the @xmath371 s . the requirement",
    "@xmath374 then leads to the inequalities @xmath380 which can be brought to the form @xmath381 and its permutations . in the same way we can get @xmath382 and its permutations .",

    "terms with less than three @xmath157 s or @xmath162 s are smaller for the same reasons .",
    "we thus conclude that for large fluxes the dimension of moduli space behaves as @xmath391 we can actually find a configuration which saturates this bound on the dimensionality of moduli space .",
    "for instance , if all @xmath224 are of the same order , then by choosing all @xmath392 we get @xmath393 , in which case we get @xmath394 .",

    "we find @xmath398 from the first inequality we get that @xmath399 and from the second one we get that also @xmath400 so that we arrive again to the same conclusion ( [ eq:163 ] ) as before .",
    "in addition to the directions in the moduli space that change the two polynomials and control the embedding of the d - brane , there are additional dimensions of the moduli space related to wilson lines .",
    "the number of wilson lines is related to the 1 dimensional homology group of the riemann surface the d - brane is wrapping .",
    "we can try to estimate this number as follows .",
    "we can think of the polynomials @xmath401 as polynomials in a projective space by adding a new variable @xmath402 and making all terms have the same weight of @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",

    "it is then possible using algebraic geometry methods to calculate the euler characteristic of the complete intersection of these 5 polynomials to be @xmath406 as before , we have @xmath407 and @xmath408 so that we have @xmath409 .",
    "since the number of wilson lines is just the genus , it scales as the euler characteristic , and we get that @xmath410 as before . we thus conclude that the total dimension of the moduli space with given wrapping numbers scales in the same fashion , @xmath411    we note that this behavior may point us towards an @xmath143 gauge theory , as the dimension of the moduli space can than be viewed as coming from the degrees of freedom of strings sitting in the bifundamental representation of any two @xmath137 factors .",
