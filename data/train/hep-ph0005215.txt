    "the nonlinear effects of qed are due to the interaction of a photon with electron - positron field .",
    "these processes are the photon - photon scattering , the coherent photon scattering ( the elastic scattering of a photon by the static coulomb field called often the delbrck scattering ) , the photon splitting into two photons , and the coalescence of two photons into photon in the coulomb field . among these processes",
    "the coherent scattering of photon has been observed and investigated experimentally ( see reviews @xcite and @xcite ) during last decades , the most accurate measurement of the coherent scattering has been performed not long ago in the budker institute of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the photon splitting into two photons in the coulomb field was observed for the first time at budker inp only recently @xcite .",
    "observation of photon - photon scattering is still a challenge .",
    "history of the coherent photon scattering study can be found in the mentioned reviews .",
    "there is a special interest to the process for heavy elements because contributions of higher orders of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the charge of nucleus , @xmath3 ) into the amplitude of photon scattering are very important .",
    "this means that one needs the theory which is exact with respect to the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitudes of the coherent photon scattering valid for any @xmath1 for high energy photon ( @xmath4 ) and small scattering angle ( or small momentum transfer @xmath5 ) were calculated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the approximate method of summing of the set of feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of photons exchanged with the coulomb source was used .",
    "another representation of these amplitudes ( in the coulomb field ) was found in @xcite , using the quasiclassical green function of the dirac equation in the coulomb field .",
    "this green function in a spherically symmetrical external field was obtained in @xcite where the coherent photon scattering in the screened coulomb potential was investigated as well . lately",
    "this green function was calculated for `` localized potential '' , and the coherent photon scattering was analyzed using it @xcite .",
    "recently the process of the coherent photon scattering was considered @xcite in frame of the quasiclassical operator method ( see e.g. @xcite ) which appears to be very adequate for consideration of this problem .",
    "the coherent photon scattering belong to the class of electromagnetic processes which in high - energy region occurs over rather long distance , known as the formation length . among other processes",
    "there are the bremsstrahlung and the pair creation by a photon .",
    "if anything happens to an electron while traveling this distance , the emission can be disrupted .",
    "landau and pomeranchuk  @xcite showed that if the formation length of bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the distance over which a mean angle of the multiple scattering becomes comparable with a characteristic angle of radiation , the bremsstrahlung will be suppressed .",
    "migdal  @xcite developed a quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is known as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect .",
    "a very successful series of experiments ( see @xcite , @xcite ) was performed at slac during last years . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energy 8  gev and 25  gev is measured with an accuracy of the order of a few percent .",
    "the lpm was observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments were the challenge for the theory since in all the previous papers calculations are performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for description of the new experiment .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb corrections ( at least for heavy elements ) is larger then experimental errors and these corrections should be taken into account .",
    "recently authors @xcite developed the new approach to the theory of the lpm effect in frame of the quasiclassical operator method . in it",
    "the cross section of bremsstrahlung process in the photon energies region where the influence of the lpm effect is very strong was calculated with term @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is characteristic logarithm of the problem , and with the coulomb corrections taken into account . in the photon energy region , where the lpm effect is `` turned off ''",
    ", the obtained cross section gives the exact bethe - heitler cross section ( within power accuracy ) with the coulomb corrections .",
    "this important feature was absent in the previous calculations .",
    "the contribution of an inelastic scattering of a projectile on atomic electrons is also included .",
    "we have analyzed ( see @xcite , @xcite ) the soft part of spectrum , including all the accompanying effects : the boundary photon emission , the multiphoton radiation and the influence of the polarization of a medium .",
    "perfect agreement of the theory and slac data was achieved in the whole interval of measured photon energies .",
    "very recently we apply this approach to the process of pair creation by a photon in @xcite .    in the quasiclassical approximation",
    "the amplitude @xmath8 of the coherent photon scattering is described by diagram where the electron - positron pair is created by the initial photon with 4-momentum @xmath9 and then annihilate into the final photon with 4-momentum @xmath10 . for high energy photon",
    "@xmath4 this process occurs over a rather long distance , known as the time of life of the virtual state @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the characteristic transverse momentum of the process , the system @xmath13 is used .",
    "when the virtual electron ( or positron ) is moving in a medium it scatters on atoms .",
    "the mean square of momentum transfer to the electron from a medium on the distance @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the charge of nucleus , @xmath18 is the number density of atoms in the medium , @xmath5 is the photon momentum transfer ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the screening radius of atom .",
    "the coherent photon scattering amplitude @xmath8 can be obtained from general formulas for probabilities of electromagnetic processes in the frame of the quasiclassical operator method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath21 we use the normalization condition im@xmath22 for the case @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total cross section of pair creation by a photon .",
    "in the case of small momentum transfer @xmath25 we have in the region of small @xmath0 @xmath26    at an ultrahigh energy it is possible that @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the characteristic momentum transfer @xmath28 is defined by the momentum transfer @xmath29 .",
    "the self - consistency condition is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined in ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "so using ( [ 1.3 ] ) one gets for the estimate of the coherent photon scattering amplitude @xmath8 ( the influence of the multiple scattering manifests itself at the high photon energies such that @xmath32 ) @xmath33    in the present paper we use consider the influence of the multiple scattering on the process of the coherent photon scattering for @xmath34 .",
    "the theory of the coherent photon scattering in the coulomb field in frame of the quasiclassical operator method is stated in sec.2 . we give here an alternative presentation of approach developed in @xcite in a more formal way . in sec.3",
    "we apply the method developed in @xcite , @xcite to investigation of influence of the multiple scattering on the process of the coherent photon scattering .",
    "the general formulas describing this influence were derived and the asymptotic cases of the strong and weak effects are analyzed .",
    "the coherent scattering of a photon in the coulomb field ( the photon with momentum @xmath35 ) is represented by the electron loop in the coulomb field , and @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is @xmath37 , \\label{3.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath40 is the electron green function in the coulomb field the standard representation of which is @xmath41 here @xmath42 are the solution of dirac equation in the coulomb field , signs @xmath43 and @xmath44 relate respectively to positive and negative frequencies .",
    "as well known , see e.g.@xcite , sec.12 , in the noncovariant perturbation theory , which we use here , in high - energy region ( @xmath4 ) the diagram contributes into the amplitude @xmath45 where the electron - positron pair is first created by the initial photon with 4-momentum @xmath46 and polarization @xmath47 in time @xmath48 and then annihilate in time @xmath49 into final photon with 4-momentum @xmath10 and polarization @xmath50 , while the contribution of the interval in which @xmath51 is of the order @xmath52 .",
    "such contribution is neglected in the scope of our method .",
    "taking this into account and substituting the green function into the amplitude ( [ 3.1 ] ) we find @xmath53 where @xmath54 it is evident that @xmath55 ( [ 3.4 ] ) is the matrix element of pair creation by a photon in an external field . in the quasiclassical operator method ( see @xcite , sec.3 ) the wave functions in an external field can be presented in the form @xmath56 |n>,\\quad { \\cal h}=\\sqrt{m^2+{\\bf p}^2 } , \\label{3.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the potential of an atom , @xmath58 is the state in the configuration space at the time @xmath59 , the functions @xmath60 have form of wave functions for free particles in the momentum space ( @xmath61 ) .",
