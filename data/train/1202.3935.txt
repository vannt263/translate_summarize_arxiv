    "<S> this could arise from a mass imbalance of the pairing fermions such as in color superconductivity or in the vicinity of magnetic impurities within conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the fflo ( fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ) @xcite proposal suggests that in such circumstances the condensation will occur from pairs with finite center - of - mass momenta . despite decades of work @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> this state has not been unambiguously observed . </S>",
    "<S> although recent experiments @xcite in one dimension ( 1d ) confirmed important aspects of the phase diagram @xcite , conclusive evidence of the fflo phase was not obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that during a non - equilibrium expansion , the polarized 1d superfluid develops strong signatures in the density profiles of the paring species which are a direct consequence of the fflo crystalline order and constitute incontrovertible evidence .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a polarized degenerate fermi gas confined to a 1d harmonic trap . in general , according to the mermin - ho - wagner theorem , a 1d superfluid system can not support superfluidity and would possess , at best , algebraically decaying long range order at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however for the finite systems that we study here , there is copious theoretical evidence that fflo correlations occur and are fairly robust @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the experiments use not a single 1d trap but a loosely coupled array which allows tuning of the inter - tube coupling and thus makes it possible to study the 3d to 1d crossover physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although a partially polarzied phase was observed through direct imaging in the experiment , it is quite clear from recent work that the fflo correlations _ do not _ leave a detectable signature on the ground state density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> thus the character of the partially polarized phase remains unknown .    </S>",

    "<S> first is the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) @xcite ( see supplemental material at for details of methods ) , an exact approach that retains all important correlations . </S>",
    "<S> second is the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) method , an effective theory approach which retains only the two point correlations and describes the spin densities @xmath32 and the superfluid gap @xmath33 through quasi - particle wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the bdg has the advantage that , when correct , it provides a clear picture of the dynamics of the pairing field @xmath34 in direct association with the particle densities @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> however , although the bdg has been observed to give a very good description of 1d samples at weak interaction @xcite , we do not expect this trend to extend from moderate to strong interaction . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the tebd method provides a stringent check for the observed phenomena in the bdg approach . in both cases we work at @xmath0 and </S>",
    "<S> employ a canonical approach which fixes @xmath1 and @xmath36 .    to observe the fflo state </S>",
    "<S> , experiments must verify crystalline order in @xmath33 or alternatively , that the average center - of - mass momentum of the pairs @xmath37 is proportional to the separation of the fermi surfaces @xmath38 . in 1d </S>",
    "<S> this relationship can be recast in terms of the spin density @xmath39 as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the size of the partially polarized region . recently </S>",
    "<S> a number of authors @xcite have suggested the measurement of the pair momentum distribution function @xmath42 as the most promising avenue to detecting the finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath43 of the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these suggestions are extrapolations from equilibrium studies where @xmath42 shows peaks at @xmath44 in contrast to the peak at @xmath45 expected for regular bcs pairing . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are not aware of analyses of @xmath42 accounting for the interacting nature of the expansion dynamics and in particular how well this signal will be preserved . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly important for 1d given that @xmath26 increases during expansion [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gamma ] ) ] . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility of finding a signal directly in real space . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reveal that :    * upon axial expansion , strong accents develop in the spin density profiles . * </S>",
    "<S> the position of these accents exactly coincide with the nodes in the pair correlation function and represent _ prima facie _ evidence of fflo correlations . </S>",
    "<S> * the strength of this signal increases with @xmath26 and decreases with polarization , being strongest when the spin excitations are gapped . * </S>",
    "<S> the accents in the spin density move much more slowly than the edge of the cloud .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p_050_g8_n40_exp ] dramatic accents in the spin densities are observed as the expansion of the cloud proceeds . through a comparison of the density plots with the corresponding gap parameter @xmath46 ( bottom row in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p_050_g8_n40_exp ] ) one can make a key observation : _ the position and growth of the spin density accents respectively coincide with the nodes and amplification of @xmath46_. furthermore , these spin density accents ( or the order parameter nodes ) move much slower during the expansion compared to the edge of the whole cloud .    to understand this phenomenon , it is helpful to first layout some broad features of the ground state utilizing the phase diagram for a homogeneous system together with the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite . under lda , the trapped system can be regarded as locally homogeneous with chemical potential defined by : @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two regimes to be considered @xcite depending on whether @xmath36 is smaller or larger than a critical polarization @xmath48 . for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an fflo state at the center of the trap surrounded by fully paired bcs wings at the edges . here </S>",
    "<S> the bdg calculation tells us that there is exactly one excess spin bound to each of the nodes of the order parameter and the fflo state is analogous to a band insulator of the _ relative motion _ between the unpaired and paired particles . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p_050_g8_n40_exp ] is within this regime and density accents represent the localization of unpaired spins at the nodes of @xmath50 . during the time of flight , </S>",
    "<S> the excess spins are kept pinned to the nodes of the order parameter and become more tightly bound . </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic effects observed occur when this localization couples with the average enhancement of @xmath51 implied by an increasing @xmath26 as the density drops during expansion [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gamma ] ) ] ; a uniquely 1d phenomenon . henceforth we refer to these accents as node signatures .    </S>",

    "<S> we expect the node signatures to be less dramatic which is confirmed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p_150_g8_n40_exp ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the spin accents near the edges are not well resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore conclude that the best place to observe the node signature is at @xmath49 where the signal is enhanced by both a large separation of the nodes and greater contrast with the background density . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the value of @xmath48 increases with @xmath56 implying a sizable observation window at strong interactions where experiments are conducted .    at equilibrium </S>",

    "<S> one can see that the modulation depth of the spin density of a trapped cloud is not very sensitive to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the bdg calculation where the spin density modulation is indeed enhanced as @xmath26 is increased  an indication of the invalidity of the mean - field theory for strong interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in the exact calculation , the localization of excess spin at large @xmath56 is counter - balanced by increased quantum fluctuations neglected in the mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dramatic emergence of node signatures is a unique feature of expansion dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> ground state density profiles in trap , with @xmath52 , @xmath66 and for different interaction strengths @xmath65 . in each plot , we show @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 obtained from tebd calculation . for clarity , the spin density @xmath69 is magnified by a factor of 2.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]     expansion profiles for two different samples with @xmath52 , @xmath66 but at different interaction strengths @xmath65 . in each plot , we plot the tebd result for @xmath69 . in both cases , </S>",

    "<S> [ spin ] where the spin densities in an expanding cloud are shown for two sets of interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> though the results from the strong and weak interaction are qualitatively similar , the spin accents start to develop earlier for the case of smaller @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this could play an important role in practice when finite lifetime of the system must be taken into account .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the expansion dynamics of polarized fermi superfluid in 1d using both the bdg and tebd methods . </S>",
    "<S> our results predict that strong spin density modulations which can be readily observed in experiment , emerge during expansion and provide direct evidence of the fflo state . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the pair momentum distribution function described above , other methods @xcite have been proposed in the literature to detect fflo . </S>",
    "<S> however they all rely on interferometric techniques requiring two fermionic superfluids , one of them being the fflo state . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal , in contrast , only requires the fflo cloud itself and hence is significantly simpler . in a more general context </S>",
    "<S> , our work shows that quantum dynamics of low - dimensional atomic gases is highly non - trivial and deserve a more thorough study in the future .    </S>",
