    "the uncertainty in co concentration is @xmath46 .",
    "sem data taken with resolution down to 1.5 nm exclude the presence of either bulk secondary phases or embedded nanoparticles .",

    "@xcite    what could be the mechanism of the wfm in fe@xmath0co@xmath1sb@xmath2 alloys ? knowing that there is an inversion symmetry at the fe site in the _ pnnm _ space group of fesb@xmath2 , we can exclude the presence of the dzayloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) type of interactions .",
