    "the gerda  ( * * ger**manium * * d**etector * * a**rray ) experiment is searching for the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath3 ) decay of @xmath4ge  @xcite .",
    "it is located in hall a of the underground laboratory laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( ) of infn  at a depth of 3500 meter water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) . in order to search effectively for such a rare process as the @xmath3  decay gerda  needs to be equipped with a dedicated veto systems which tags muons passing the experiment  @xcite . here",
    "we report about the observed rates including an annual modulation of the latter during the period 20102013 which encompasses phase  i of gerda .",
    "other underground experiments have observed similar annual modulations of their rates , either due to the muon flux  @xcite or of other origin  @xcite .",
    "a full explanation of the muon rate is important to assure that the systematics of the experiment are fully understood , in particular when aiming for reduced backgrounds in future phases .",
    "a particular problem could be the generation of unstable isotopes by the muons directly or through the secondary neutron flux .",
    "thus , the more obvious sources of backgrounds must be understood .",
    "the present results serve also as cross checks to previous or future data sets on muon fluxes in underground laboratories .",
    "the hardware of the muon veto worked very reliable and stable .",
    "the overall muon rate of the veto is observed to be modulated by two different sources .",
    "firstly , the majority of the detectable muons are produced cosmogenically  @xcite .",
    "their spectrum and angular distribution within the halls are both altered by the profile of the rock overburden and have been measured for  with high precision  @xcite .",
    "these muons have an average energy of @xmath5  gev . due to seasonal temperature changes in the atmosphere the mean muon energy changes over the year and thus the muon flux at .    secondly , an artificial source for muons was the cern neutrinos to gran sasso ( ) neutrino beam  @xcite in the period 20082012 serving the opera experiment  @xcite for the search of @xmath6 oscillations",
    ". this @xmath7 beam can create muons by charged current reactions along its 730  km long path .",
    "thus , an additional muon flux is expected during any  beam line operation . as the beam is not operated continuously but pauses in the winter months",
    ", the additional flux takes the form of an annual modulation .",
    "both effects can be described with high precision .",
    "the parameters for the atmospheric muon generation are presented in this work which agree well with other experiments at .",
    "the muon veto consists of two parts .",
    "the gerda  water tank  is instrumented with 66 photomultipliers of 8  size which detect the cherenkov light of passing muons  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the germanium crystals are lowered through the `` neck '' from the clean room into the liquid argon ( lar ) cryostat for normal operation .",
    "this `` neck '' region is less monitored by the cherenkov veto .",
    "thus , it is covered in addition by a 4@xmath83  m@xmath9 layer of plastic scintillators equipped with pmts on top of the gerda  clean room . in the analysis shown here the standard gerda  muon veto analysis cuts",
    "were performed . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite a 18  p.e .",
    "( photo electron ) cut on the cherenkov data or a valid combination of panels are needed to create a trigger .",
    "the stability of the rates and of the light output of veto system was checked periodically .",
    "sketch of the gerda  experiment  @xcite . ]",
    "this muon veto data set contains a period of 806 days from november 2010 to july 2013 that includes also a period before phase  i. particularly during phase  i of the gerda  experiment the veto system ran continuously stable and reliable .",
    "time offset between cngs and muon veto events .",
    "the left plot shows the time resolution before the installation of the gps clock , the right one after .",
    "the origin in both plots is set to the rising flank of the main feature .",
    "note the different time scales . ]",
    "the cern sps delivered proton bunches with an energy of 400  gev that hit a carbon target in the  beam line  @xcite . actually , each sps extraction consists of two proton bunches which are 10.5  @xmath10s  wide and 50  ms apart .",
    "normally , the extraction is repeated every 6  s. pions and kaons from the collision products are focused on a decay line pointed towards .",
    "these particles can decay according to @xmath11 .",
    "muon detectors at the end of the decay line record the @xmath12 which can be correlated with the @xmath7 intensity .",
    "the primary @xmath12 will be stopped on the way towards  while the @xmath7 travel almost unhindered .",
    "the @xmath7 however are able to produce secondary muons of @xmath13  gev via @xmath14 reactions upstream of .",
    "thus , an additional muon flux impinges horizontally into the gerda  setup .    both systems , the  beam at cern and the muon veto of the gerda  experiment , were operational at the same time during 404 days in 2011 and 2012 .",
    "in this period @xmath1528800 coincident muons due to @xmath15@xmath16 protons - on - target were detected .",
    "the events of both  and muon veto were correlated by using their respective time stamps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeres ] the time differences of valid signals from both facilities are shown . the enhancement above the random background shows that true coincidences are observed . in the beginning , the muon veto was running with a cpu clock .",
    "however , prior to the start of phase  i a gps clock was installed  @xcite .",
    "a sharpening of the enhancement of the correlated events is clearly visible from the time spectra of both clock systems .",
    "compared to the cpu clock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeres ] , left ) the time resolution increased dramatically after the installation of the gps clock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeres ] , right ) . with the gps clock",
    "the 10.5  @xmath10s  bunch length of the  beam can be reproduced .",
    "this shows that the recorded events can be correlated in time with high accuracy when tested against an external source like the  beam .",
    "the accurate timing will also be of advantage when searching for cosmogenic reaction products and their identification via their half life .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cngsint ] time series of the daily beam intensities measured at cern ( top ) , the number of events correlated with the muon veto per day ( middle ) and the number of coincident events per beam intensity ( bottom ) are shown .",
    "the flat distribution in the bottom panel demonstrates the proportionality between the beam intensity and muon        events .",
    "this nicely confirms the correct identification of coincident events .",
    "the overall fraction of  events in the muon data is of the order of 2.2% . using the time stamps ,",
    "coincidences between germanium data and  events can be found as well .",
    "a number of 45 coincident germanium events were identified in phase  i of gerda  and 42 of these were accompanied by a muon veto trigger and hence correctly discarded . with the rates of the beam and the germanium detectors a number of @xmath17 random coincident events are expected for this period and thus the remaining three germanium events can be attributed to random coincidences .",
    "a single  event was recorded in the 230  kev wide interpolation region around @xmath18  for the background - index ( bi ) of gerda . however , this event had a veto flag and was hence excluded from the analysis and had no effect on the bi .",
    "since the  has been decommissioned in 2013 , there will be no influence of this type in the next phase of gerda .",
    "the identified events due to the  beam shown in fig .  [ fig : cngsint ] are removed from the sample for a proper analysis of the temperature dependence of the cosmic muon fraction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : modulation ] , top ) .",
    "the annual modulation of the muon flux is a well - studied phenomenon  @xcite . due to the shielding effect of atmosphere and rock overburden ,",
    "only cosmogenically produced muons with an energy above a certain threshold @xmath19 will be able to reach an experiment located at a specific depth .",
    "most muons are decay products of pions and kaons in showers caused by cosmic radiation .",
    "the amount of energy that can be transferred to their decay products depends on the number of scatterings of the mesons during their life time .",
    "the number of scatterings of a meson is governed by its mean free path which depends on the density of the air and ultimately is influenced by the temperature .",
    "hence the atmospheric temperature and the subsequent density of air molecules influence the muon energy spectrum and thus the flux at a certain depth . since the main temperature change is seasonal , in first order approximation a cosine - like behavior of the flux",
    "can be assumed that takes the form @xmath20where @xmath21 is the actual , @xmath22 the mean muon flux , and @xmath23 the amplitude of the modulation ; @xmath24 is the phase marking the summer maximum .",
    "the fit to the rate of the gerda  muon veto is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation ] ( top ) .",
    "the period of the fit was fixed to @xmath25  d because only two maxima are covered up to now . from the top panel",
    "it is obvious that a pure cosine - function will not describe the rate modulation due to local weather conditions changing from year to year , like an unusually warm winter 2010/11 .",
    "the same kind of deviations can be observed also from the temperature data ( fig  [ fig : modulation ] , middle ) .",
    "muon fluxes at  are conventionally given normalized to the effective area of the experiment , i.e. the projection of its geometry on the muon angular spectrum , weighted by the muon intensity .",
    "the gerda  water tank  has an effective area of @xmath26  m@xmath9 .",
    "the fit yields a muon flux of @xmath0/(s@xmath1m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the systematic error is derived solely from the uncertainty of the effective area of the water tank .",
    "due to a muon detection efficiency of nearly unity  @xcite its contributions to the systematic uncertainty becomes negligible .",
    "the modulation of @xmath27/s corresponds to an amplitude of @xmath28 of @xmath22 .",
    "the phase @xmath24 shifts the maximum to the 10@xmath29 of july ( @xmath30  days ) . the fit parameters for the muons agree well with results from other experiments at , some of them are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : modupar ] .",
    "the phase of all experiments has its maximum in early july and hence it is not compatible with the phase observed by the dama dark matter experiment that is on the 2@xmath31 of june  @xcite .",
    "the deviation @xmath32 from the detected average muon flux depends on the change in temperature @xmath33 of a given layer @xmath34 of the atmosphere",
    ". the overall change of the muon flux can then be written as an integral over all layers : @xmath35 the coefficient @xmath36 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) contains both the weight of a certain atmospheric layer to the overall muon flux for both pions and kaons as well as the threshold energy given for a certain underground site , i.e. the rock overburden .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath37 is a weighted average of the temperature over all layers of the atmosphere assuming the atmosphere to be an isothermal body  @xcite .",
    "it can be approximated as follows : @xmath38similarly for the difference:@xmath39there are two sets of temperature data available for the period studied .",
    "the european centre for medium - range weather forecast ( ecwmf )  @xcite offers climate data taken by many different observational methods such as weather stations , aircrafts , balloons and satellites to interpolate the climate at any given location . for each location ,",
    "temperature data for 37 atmospheric pressure levels from 01000  hpa are listed four times a day .",
    "the second data set is provided by the airs instrument  @xcite on - board the nasa aqua satellite  @xcite .",
    "the analyses regarding the airs data were produced with data retrieved with the giovanni online data system , developed and maintained by the nasa ges disc  @xcite .",
    "the satellite is in a synchronous orbit with the sun and thus it passes each position of the earth twice per day . the ascending overpass over",
    "the gran sasso is at about 1:00 a.m. and the descending overpass at 1:00 p.m. airs is an infrared sounder and can therefore be disturbed by clouds .",
    "similar to ecwmf it provides temperature data in 24 different pressure levels at any given point .",
    "the effective temperature calculated from both datasets can be seen in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation ] .",
    "both sets agree very well with their trends and also within their fine - structure despite their different detection and analysis methods .",
    "a fit of a cosine - function yields a mean temperature of @xmath40  k for the airs data and @xmath41  k for the ecwmf data .",
    "both amplitudes are found to be 4  k and the temperature maxima are found on day @xmath42 , i.e. july 4@xmath29 . given the short period and the gaps , the agreement between the maxima for the muon rate and for the temperature is more than adequate .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation ] gives the ratio of the muon rate and the effective temperature .",
    "this ratio is constant for the measured period yielding a mean value of ( 1.57@xmath430.01)@xmath44 muons/(k s m@xmath9 ) .",
    "all the fine structured deviations from the cosine have vanished within the uncertainties .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the change in temperature versus the change in muon flux can be quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath45 , which is @xmath46 for a full positive / negative correlation and 0 for uncorrelated values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "a graphical representation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] , the coefficients @xmath45 of both data sets are around 0.65 and thus a positive linear dependency exists .",
    "therefore , the change in temperature and muon flux can be written as : @xmath49where @xmath50 is an `` effective temperature coefficient '' .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "[ eq : sec ] and  [ eq : four ] , this coefficient becomes : @xmath51 allowing model predictions to access @xmath50 . like @xmath36",
    ", @xmath50 depends on the threshold energy of the respective depth and on the amount of muons from pion and kaon decay .",

    "a linear fit ( @xmath56/ndf@xmath57=391/410 , @xmath56/ndf@xmath58=364/351 ) yields values for @xmath50 . ]",
    "this atmospheric model  @xcite containing both pion and kaon processes can be used to calculate a theoretical value that amounts to @xmath59 for the lngs and that agrees well with both experimentally derived values .",
    "the values derived from the present fit are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : modupar ] and are compared to the results of other experiments at lngs and soudan which are in good agreement even though in some analyses atmospheric models which only included muons produced by pion decay are used .",
    "if the amount of rock overburden , i.e. the depth of the laboratory , is varied in the atmospheric model , a relation between depth and @xmath50 can be calculated @xcite .",
    "an additional factor in this calculation is the ratio of pions to kaons produced in the atmosphere .",
    "muons which originate from kaons have a higher average energy and are thus less affected by the shielding effect of the rock overburden . a graph of @xmath50 as a function of depth of observation ( fig .",

    "the full red line notes the literature value for the atmospheric kaon / pion ratio  @xcite . ]    in these data , two modulation effects with an overall influence on the muon flux of 34% could be identified : the additional muon flux caused by the cngs neutrino beam and the seasonal change in the muon rate caused by temperature variation in the atmosphere which influences the muon production mechanisms .",
    "a clear correlation between the  @xmath7 beam and events in the muon veto could be established thanks to the very precise gps clock in gerda .",

    "most of these events were tagged by the muon veto .",
    "the number of untagged events is consistent with the expected number of random coincidences .",
    "an atmospheric model for the seasonal modulation of the muon flux due to atmospheric changes was applied to the data .",
    "this model contains both pions and kaons in the muon production mechanism .",
    "two sets of climate data were used to generate an effective temperature , which was found to be in direct relation and in good correlation with the recorded muon flux variation .",
