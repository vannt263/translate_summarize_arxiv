    "domains of different magnetic orientations spontaneously nucleate in all magnetic materials in order to minimize the magnetostatic energy ( dipolar interaction ) of the system .",
    "these domains are separated by domain or bloch walls where the magnetization is changing over , rapidly , from one orientation to an other . in this paper",
    "we shall develop a theoretical account of these transition regions in terms of mobile electrons and their spins , that is to say from first principles .",
    "the understanding and control of the domain structure , magnetic morphology , is central to the effective use of magnetic materials in many technologies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nature , shape , and motion of bloch walls have always attracted fundamental scientific interest @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all the theoretical discussions so far , of the entire subject , have been strictly phenomenological . in the present paper",
    "we wish to lay the foundation of a first - principles approach to the problem .    to start with a tractable problem , henceforth , we shall focus on that of a single bloch wall .",
    "note that whilst its width , @xmath1 @xmath2 , much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath3 , it is smallest of all the other length scales such as the sizes of the domains , @xmath4 @xmath5 , magnetic texture , @xmath6 @xmath7 , etc . in the problem .",
    "thus , by deploying our first - principles methodology , designed to treat variations in properties on the length - scale @xmath3 , to bloch wall problems , we are making the natural choice of crossing the smallest scale - gap first .",

    "what follows we shall study this simple example of a 90@xmath38 bloch wall from the point of view of mobile electron whose spin gives rise to such magnetic configuration .",
    "given the success and the general satisfaction with the established phenomenological theory outlined above one may , at this stage , protest that such microscopic considerations are not needed .",
    "to answer this objection we shall now pause briefly to argue the case to the contrary . in the interest of economy we present our arguments as a list of brief statements :    * firstly , the phenomenological theory assumes that @xmath39 rotates as @xmath17 goes from @xmath40 to @xmath41 without a change in magnitude .",
    "a first - principles theory should tell us if and when this is true .",
    "* because , as yet , experiments can not tell us otherwise @xcite , the phenomenological theory accepts the form of @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soliton ] ) as immutable .",
    "by contrast , the microscopic theory could discover situations ( materials ) where this is not",
    "the same thing can be said about deviations of @xmath24 from @xmath43 as a function of @xmath17 or , indeed , the @xmath44 dependence of both @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "* of course , first - principles calculations not only yield @xmath45 but also the changes in the electronic structure due to the deviation of @xmath45 from its saturation value , namely the presence of a bloch wall .",
    "in other words , they describe the electronic structure which supports , consistent with , a bloch wall .",
    "this novel information becomes available for the first time in the calculations we shall report . * the change in the electronic states due to the presence of a bloch wall is , or",
    "can be viewed as a description of the electron ",
    "bloch wall interaction .",
    "clearly , a study of this interaction will make an important contribution to understanding the widely observed magneto - transport phenomena associated with electrons scattering off bloch walls @xcite .",
    "* inevitably , a magnetic inhomogeneity will distort the underlying lattice and such distortions give rise to bloch wall ",
    "bloch wall interactions and pinning of bloch walls by lattice defects like impurities vacancies or grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "although we do not deal with the appropriate generalization of our first - principles approach , we wish to stress that it can be readily adopted to address these issues and this possibility is an important part of the motivation for perusing it .    finally , we comment on our choice of bcc iron as the host to the bloch wall in our calculations .",
    "as is well known the saturation magnetic moment per atom @xmath46 at @xmath47 and the effective moment @xmath48 deduced from the curie constants , measured at @xmath49 , for metallic ferromagnets are usually not the same .",
    "in fact , the deviation of @xmath46/@xmath48 from 1 can be taken as a good measure of how independent the local magnetic moments are from their relative orientation . since",
    "bcc iron is a famously good moment system , namely @xmath50 , we expect the first - principles calculations to map optimally onto the phenomenological theory summarized by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fcubic ] ) and ( [ eq : soliton ] ) .",
    "this is indeed what we find and we take this fact as a validation of our conceptual framework as well as our numerical procedures for implementing it .",
    "the prize to pay for having done this easy case is that the importance of all the novel features listed above ( _ a .- e .",
    "_ ) are minimized .",
    "thus , if we disregard these interesting but small effects , our calculations reduce to a new , if complicated , way of computing the material dependent parameters , e.g. the spin - wave stiffness constant @xmath51 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath52 . as these",
    "are also available from other type of first - principles calculations @xcite , the comparison of our results with those of others in the field is a useful exercise in its own right .    in the next section",
    "we shall describe the first - principles theoretical framework , based on a relativistic , spin - polarized density functional theory , for our calculations.this is followed by a section describing the computational procedures .",
    "we shall present and discuss our results in sec .",
    "4 . , whereas in sec . 5 .",
    "we shall evaluate the progress we have been able to make and the prospects of the microscopic approach we have advocated .",
    "a fully relativistic density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , which includes the dipolar interaction between electrons , would , presumably , yield an inhomogeneous ground state with the domain structure determined by the size and shape of the sample . clearly , the corresponding calculations are out of the question and we shall follow the logic of the phenomenological theory .",
    "namely , we neglect the dipolar interaction and study a single bloch wall engendered by the constraint that the magnetization @xmath45 is oriented along two different easy axes at @xmath53 . this problem is readily encompassed by the spin - polarized relativistic density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) as usually applied in solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "there are only two features of the way we shall proceed which deserve further general comment .",
    "firstly , we note that we shall not be looking for a ground state , as usual , but a lowest energy state consistent with a constraint which prescribes a symmetry different from the ground state . fortunately",
    ", as it is well known , dft covers this eventuality @xcite .",
    "secondly , we shall not attempt to address the vexing conceptual difficulties that arise in connection with imposing constraints while solving self - consistently the kohn - sham - dirac equation of the theory @xcite , but in this preliminary exploration of the subject implement our strategy in the simplest possible way as outlined below .",
    "there is no reason to doubt that the established phenomenological theory @xcite in the introduction gets the essential physics of the bloch wall formation right .",
    "from the point of view of formulating a first - principles version of this theory it may be summarized as follows : the changing orientation of @xmath39 , namely the variation of @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soliton ] ) , across the bloch wall implies an exchange energy cost which is lower the slower the variation , whereas the anisotropy energy favors a rapid change from one easy direction , @xmath54 , to the other , @xmath55 , and the width of the transition region of @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soliton ] ) , @xmath56 , is determined by the balance of these two tendencies .",
    "indeed , we can bypass the solution of the euler - lagrange equation , which in the case of minimizing the free - energy @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcubic ] ) is the famous sine - gordon equation whose solution is @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soliton ] ) , and take @xmath42 to be a simple function , @xmath57 , which goes from 0 to @xmath43 in a distance of @xmath58 and minimize the corresponding free - energy @xmath59 with respect to the width @xmath58 . as can be readily shown , by substituting @xmath57 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcubic ] ) , for @xmath33    @xmath60    where @xmath61 clearly , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fsimple ] ) , proportional to 1/@xmath58 , is due to the exchange interaction measured by @xmath51 and the second term , which is proportional to @xmath58 and the constant @xmath52 , represents the contribution of the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy for cubic systems .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 reaches its minimum at    @xmath62    given that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are simple dimensionless numbers which parameterize the profile @xmath57 , this result agrees well with the exact soliton solution for @xmath65 .",
    "evidently , the above discussion suggests a rather straightforward strategy for first - principles calculations :    * assume a profile @xmath57 . *",
    "carry out a density functional calculation for the magnetization @xmath39 constrained to follow the profile @xmath57 and calculate the total energy or grand potential @xmath66 . *",
    "minimize @xmath66 with respect to @xmath58 .    for the profile we shall always take the particularly simple choice    @xmath67    which is compared to the soliton solution in fig .  2 . for this function @xmath68 and @xmath69 and hence if @xmath66 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fsimple ] )    @xmath70    which implies @xmath71 .",
    "note that this bloch wall thickness is @xmath72 times larger than that deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : soliton ] ) .",
    "thus the bloch wall thickness is to some extent an ill - defined concept in the present prescribed profile approach to the problem .",
    "as will be clear presently , our calculated @xmath66 can be fitted by the above functional form very accurately and hence it determines the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 from first principles .    for orientation we note that via the landau - lifshitz equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) , the free - energy functional given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcubic ] ) implies a spin - wave dispersion relation . in the long wave - length limit",
    "this yields    @xmath73    thus , the spin - wave stiffness constant    @xmath74    and the usual cubic ( fourth - order ) anisotropy constant @xmath75 as expected , in the presence of magneto - crystalline anisotropy the spin - wave spectrum is gaped .    without any account of dipolar interactions , in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "the orientation of the magnetization is independent from the crystal axis .",
    "as is clear from the above discussion , under this circumstance ( @xmath76 ) there is no bloch wall of finite width .",
    "thus , our calculation of @xmath66 must include spin - orbit coupling which is the major source of magneto - crystalline anisotropy in transition metals @xcite .",
    "rather than treating the spin - orbit interaction in perturbation theory , we use a fully relativistic spin - polarized density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the natural variable in the microscopic theory is the magnetization averaged over a unit cell @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the volume of the @xmath14th unit cell .",
    "we may then define the local orientation @xmath79 by @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the length of the vector @xmath82 .",
    "it is this effective local orientation that we wish to constrain to follow the discrete version of the profile in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linbw ] ) .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath83 is the same within an atomic plane with position @xmath84 and take @xmath85 where for a 90@xmath38 bloch wall , which is @xmath86 layer thick , @xmath87 thus , we have to solve the kohn - sham - dirac equation of dft for the circumstance where the orientation of the magnetization , @xmath88 , is changing from layer to layer within a slab of @xmath86 atomic layers and is uniformally @xmath89 and @xmath90/2 to the left and right , respectively , of the slab as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "evidently , the relativistic spin - polarized screened - kkr method @xcite , which treats just such geometries , is ideal for tackling this problem .",
    "fortunately , the code which implements this method scales linearly with @xmath86 and , as we shall demonstrate presently , can handle 400 - 500 layers with readily available computer power .",
    "we performed calculations proposed in the previous section by using the spin - polarized relativistic screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( spr - skkr ) method @xcite .",
    "although the method is by now well - established ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , for completeness and since we also made developments specific to the bloch wall problem , we briefly outline our computational strategy . for an ensemble of individual scatterers",
    "the multiple scattering theory ( mst ) yields the one - electron green function for an arbitrary complex energy @xmath17 and real space coordinates @xmath91 , @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 label two specific sites of position vectors @xmath97 and @xmath98 , while @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote pairs of angular momentum quantum - numbers @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 , regular and irregular at @xmath105 , respectively are properly normalized solutions of the kohn - sham - dirac equation related to a single , finite - ranged potential well for which we now assume a spherically symmetric effective potential , @xmath106 , and effective field , @xmath107 , pointing along a local ( positive ) @xmath17 coordinate axis . in short ,    @xmath108    where @xmath109    with the usual pauli matrices @xmath110 and the two - dimensional unity matrix @xmath64 .",
    "the numerical solution of the above equation with a corresponding expression for the so - called single - site _",
    "t_-matrix was originally given in refs .",
    "a particular feature resulting from the approach they used is that , although the _ t_-matrix has necessarily off - diagonal elements , no coupling between different @xmath111 values is present .",
    "we further simplify the problem by adopting the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) in which the volume of the sphere is taken equal to the volume of the corresponding wigner - seitz cell .",
    "clearly , asa deals with overlapping potentials which is , in strict sense , prohibited within the mst , however , mostly for inhomogeneous systems , this approach is widely used , since on one hand it gives a better description of the interstitial region than the muffin - tin approach , on the other hand it is conceptually much simpler than a full potential description .",
    "as implied above , our approach allows the orientation of the magnetization to vary from site to site as required in the case of a bloch wall where we keep the orientation to be constant within the atomic planes but let it rotate from layer to layer around the global @xmath17 direction .",
    "therefore , in each layer there will be a rotation @xmath112 , corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath113 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : phip ] ) ) , which relates the @xmath114-matrix in the local to that in the global coordinate system as follows    @xmath115    where @xmath116 denotes a matrix containing , block - wise , the irreducible representations of @xmath112 .",
    "as the solution of the above single - site problem is relatively easy and universal in applications of mst , the evaluation of the scattering path operator ( spo ) , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenf ] ) , is , essentially , the main difficulty in such calculations . the geometrical arrangement of the scatterers involved in the system is put , in mst , into the so - called structure constants , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , which for the relativistic case can be obtained by a transformation in terms of the clebsh - gordon coefficients from its non - relativistic counterpart ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by defining the corresponding matrices having both site and angular momentum indices @xcite @xmath120 the spo",
    "is given by the following matrix inversion    @xmath121    a particular problem arises from the fact that @xmath122 is long - ranged , therefore , the inversion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsspo ] ) can not be directly performed . for a system with three - dimensional periodicity",
    "the problem can be exactly handled by making use of the lattice fourier - transformation , which splits eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsspo ] ) into the corresponding @xmath123-projections which has to be solved in angular momentum space only .",
    "the bloch wall problem we deal with exhibits , however , two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodicity in the @xmath124 plane , while in the @xmath17 direction the translational symmetry is broken due to the variation of the orientation of the magnetization . thus employing two - dimensional lattice fourier - transforms",
    "@xmath125    where @xmath21 and @xmath126 denote atomic layers , generated by @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , @xmath129 are 2d lattice vectors and @xmath130 is a vector in the first 2d brillouin - zone ( bz ) , and the new matrix notation in terms of layer indices @xmath131 one can write @xmath132    evaluating the matrix inversion in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dspo ] ) is still demanding since the structure constants involved are long - ranged as far as the interlayer distances are concerned . in order to render this problem tractable the concept of screening has been introduced in the middle of nineties @xcite . without going into details , a canonical transformation of the _ t_-matrices and the structure constants , which leaves the green function invariant , in terms of repulsive scattering potentials makes it possible to reduce the spatial range of the effective structure constants . as",
    "this transformation is independent of the real scatterers in the system , it is very useful to perform self - consistent calculations , since it has to be performed for the structure constants only once at the beginning of calculation . in terms of the screened quantities",
    "( [ eq:2dspo ] ) has exactly the same form .",
    "however , since @xmath133 is now well - localized , it can be truncated for @xmath134 at a given @xmath95 ( @xmath135 for fcc and bcc principal facets ) , which in turn implies a block - tridiagonal form for the matrix @xmath136 .",
    "this blocks are related to the so - called principal layers containing @xmath95 subsequent atomic layers . by splitting our system into left and right perfect semi - infinite subsystems ,",
    "in each of them the scatterers are all identical ( bulk ) , and into a central region , where the potentials as well as the orientation of the magnetization can vary , the projection of the spo , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dspo ] ) , onto the central region can be calculated _ exactly _ , i.e. taking into account all the scattering events to the left and right semi - infinite regions @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the method is that , if only the layer diagonal blocks of the spo need to be calculated , it scales linearly with the size of the central region , namely @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "thus it opens the way for investigating systems with inhomogeneities extending much beyond the atomic scales such as bloch walls .",
    "let us now turn to the task of performing the brillouin - zone integration    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139 , while @xmath140 denotes the volume of the 2d bz . in ref .",
    "@xcite we described a method for reducing the demand of the above bz integration using the symmetry operations of the underlying lattice .",
    "this is obviously useless for the present case of the 90@xmath38 bloch wall , since the direction of the magnetization rotates from layer to layer , say , from the @xmath141 axis to the @xmath142 axis , therefore the bloch wall itself is not invariant under any of the symmetry operations of the @xmath143 group characteristic to the bcc(001 ) bz .    however , it is still useful to note that the magnetization direction described by the angle @xmath42 in a 90@xmath38 bloch wall perpendicular to the ( 001 ) direction of a bcc lattice and satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath144 and @xmath145 has the symmetry property @xmath146 taking into account also the symmetry of the underlying lattice this implies that the bloch wall is invariant under a @xmath147 rotation around the axis ( 110 ) which is in three dimensional space represented by the matrix @xmath148 whereby the axis of the rotation should cross the @xmath17 axis at @xmath149 , i.e. for which @xmath150 .",

    "this , on one hand , implies , that the bloch wall energy normalized to one layer is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the anisotropy energy and , on the other , we have to calculate the bloch wall energy to the same accuracy as is necessary in magneto - crystalline anisotropy calculations .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the fact that , in particular , close to the real energy axis one has to sample a high number of @xmath130-points when performing the bz - integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bzint ] ) . to reduce this problem we smoothened the energy integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : charge ] ) and ( [ eq : bande ] ) by the fermi - function at a finite temperature @xmath20 , taking into account the poles of it below the contour @xmath175 .",
    "both from an analysis of the integrand and by checking it numerically , it turns out that the contour can be deformed to infinity in the upper complex semi - plane .",
    "moreover , only a finite number of matsubara poles , @xmath194 @xmath195 , has to be considered . assuming a quadratic @xmath20 dependence of @xmath196 due to the sommerfeld expansion , in order to perform extrapolation to @xmath20=0 it was necessary to take two different @xmath20 values only .    in our calculations",
    "we choose 300k and 150k for these two temperatures by using 32 and 40 matsubara poles with 1275 and 2926 @xmath130-points in the 2d ibz for @xmath197 ( 3 and 1.5 mryd ) , respectively .",
    "these values were shown to be sufficiently high to yield converged bulk anisotropy energies which we calculated to check the reliability of our numerical evaluations with respect to other methods and also to compare to the value that can be deduced from the bloch wall energies ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : k4 ] ) . for t=300k and 150k we got @xmath191=0.142 and 0.154 @xmath192ryd , respectively , which were extrapolated to @xmath191=0.158 @xmath192ryd at t=0 . obviously , this is a very good agreement with the results of other first - principles calculations .",
    "let s now turn to the results for the bloch wall energies , associated with an area of size @xmath198 , where @xmath3 is the lattice constant of our bcc lattice , as a function of thickness @xmath58 , measured in units of @xmath3 ( @xmath199 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ frozen ] for t=150k and t=300k as diamonds and crosses , respectively .",
    "the first thing to note is that the calculated points are very well fitted by the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : linomega ] ) as drawn by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath200 are listed in table  i together what fitted for t=0 .",
    "the fitted curves have their minima at 424 and 401 lattice parameters for t=300k and t=150k , respectively .",
    "note that there is a point on the @xmath201 curve which is beyond the minimum and hence we can be said to have crossed the scale gap .",
    "the minima are very shallow due to the smallness of the anisotropy energy , thus , this is likely to be a feature of calculations for all cubic systems .    from the extrapolated values of @xmath202 and @xmath203 to @xmath47 , @xmath191=0.16 @xmath192ryd and @xmath204=262 mev@xmath205 can be derived via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : swstiffness ] ) and ( [ eq : k4 ] ) ) . by using the expression of @xmath206 from the phenomenological theory we also obtained a thickness of 394 lattice parameters for the bloch wall",
    "several experimental values can be found for @xmath204 , e.g. @xmath207 mev@xmath205 by stringfellow @xcite , @xmath208 mev@xmath205 by collins et al .",
    "@xcite or @xmath209 mev@xmath205 by mook and nicklow @xcite .",
    "so our value is only slightly below the experimental findings .",
    "the same is true for the comparison with other theoretical results found from bulk calculations @xcite .",
    "one source of discrepancies between our and other calculations is certainly the use of different lattice constants .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that by using the same computer code and a spin - flip technique , in the scalar - relativistic limit , a value of @xmath204=300 mev@xmath205 was calculated @xcite , in better agreement with those calculated by others .",
    "this suggest that another source of the deviation of our present value from those of others arises from the relativistic approach we used , that is , the spin - orbit coupling gives not only rise to the magneto - crystalline anisotropy , but to some extent influences the spin - spin interaction parametrized by @xmath204 .",
    "the value of the anisotropy constant is of greater concern .",
    "as it is generally the case in lda calculations @xcite , the experimental value , 0.3 @xmath192ryd , is roughly a factor of two bigger than the theoretical results .",
    "however , the important point here is that we find the same value for @xmath191 as given above when we determine @xmath191 from bulk calculations demonstrating the internal consistency of our calculations .    as implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegan ] ) our calculation allows to resolve the bloch wall formation energy into contributions related to layer .",
    "this than can be compared to the free - energy density of the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . taking the mean value for each layer and in terms of the parameters introduced above , for a linear 90@xmath38 bloch wall this free - energy density reads @xmath210 in fig .",
    "[ layer800 ] the solid line and crosses in the inset display the layer - resolved contributions to the bloch wall energy as calculated by our first - principles method for a 800 layer thick wall and @xmath20=150k , while the dashed curve and the diamonds in the inset are evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : endens ] ) with the the corresponding fitted parameters , @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( see table  i. ) , that is no further fitting have been used .",
    "apparently , the coincidence of the two curves is nearly perfect even in this atomic scale resolution of the bloch wall energy . as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : endens ] ) , in the phenomenological theory the exchange contribution to the layer resolved energy is constant , which equals @xmath211 , inside the wall and zero outside . a characteristic deviation from that behavior is found for the first - principles values near the edge of the wall . the exchange contribution to the first layer outside the bloch wall , i.e. , to layers numbered by 0 and 801 in fig .",
    "[ layer800 ] , is exactly half of the above constant value ( see inset of fig .  [ layer800 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the non - local nature of the exchange couplings not accounted properly within the phenomenological theory .",
    "we note that bloch wall formation can be discussed also by using an effective heisenberg hamiltonian with a cubic anisotropy term , in which the above feature is readily recovered .",
    "small oscillations can also be seen near the edge of the bloch wall .",
    "these are most likely related to friedel - type oscillations , which in homogeneous systems arise due to any imperfections , as relaxations in the electronic structure .      in order to access reliably the electronic structure in the presence of a bloch wall selfconsistent calculations",
    "have to be performed .",
    "these calculations are not ground state calculations because the magnetic moment in every layer is forced to point along a prescribed direction .",
    "the proper way to perform such calculations is to introduce a constraining field which forces the moment to point along the chosen direction @xcite . for our first attempts we ignored the constraining field and , instead ,",
    "took the projection of the magnetic moment onto the prescribed direction after every iteration .",
    "we have performed this calculation for a 60-layer bloch wall with a magnetization profile according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : linbw ] ) . we allowed 21 layers on the two sides outside the bloch wall to relax .",
    "that is , given the symmetry of the bloch wall , 51 _ different _ potentials were involved in this calculation .",
    "the charging due to the bloch wall per atom for the different layers works out to be smaller than @xmath212 and , therefore , can be considered to be zero within the accuracy of our calculations .",
    "this means we observed no charge redistribution ( transfer ) across the bloch wall . despite of this fact , as inferred from fig .",
    "[ dos ] , the densities of states show characteristic changes for different layers in the bloch wall .",
    "interestingly , the biggest changes are found at energies with also big peaks in the bulk dos , which presumably indicates lifting of some degeneracies , related to the cubic symmetry , due to the presence of bloch wall .",
    "contrary to the charges , the magnetic moments display a small but clear deviations from their bulk value . in fig .",
    "[ mag ] we show the deviation of the moment from the bulk value .",
    "obviously , the moments decrease gradually when approaching the center of the wall .",
    "surprisingly , however , the moments outside the wall still quite differ from their bulk value , approaching it relatively far from the wall only .",
    "similarly , at the center of the wall one would expect a moment equal to that calculated for a bulk with ( 110 ) hard axis .",
    "this value is shown by dashed line in fig .",
    "[ mag ] .",
    "the component of the moment parallel to the wall but perpendicular to the exchange field is shown in fig .  [ magy ] .",
    "( one should note that the frame of reference is a local one which turns round with the exchange field . )",
    "not surprisingly , the strong peaks appear at those layers which are just outside the bloch wall , as these are the layers with the most asymmetric neighborhood . clearly , these peaks are an artifact due to the prescribed magnetization profile which display pronounced kinks at the two borders of the bloch wall ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the component perpendicular to the wall is smaller than @xmath213 and therefore negligible .",
    "these calculations were performed with 91 @xmath130-points in the two dimensional irreducible brillouin zone . to achieve convergence roughly 100 iterations",
    "have been necessary ( where one iteration took roughly 14 min on 16 nodes on a t3e ) .",
    "clearly , the number of selfconsistent iterations necessary to obtain reasonable convergence goes up with the number of layers and we have not been able to achieve convergence for thicker bloch walls within the limited cpu time available to us .",
    "due to the relatively small number of @xmath130-points used in this calculations we do not claim convergence for our results .",
    "but we expect the results to be qualitatively correct .",
    "in short , we have presented a first - principles , that is to say parameter - free and yet materials specific , description of bloch walls in ferromagnets . as an example we have prescribed the orientation of the magnetization density , @xmath45 , to evolve from the easy axis ( 100 ) to ( 010 ) in bcc iron and calculated its energy , @xmath214 , as a function of the width , @xmath206 , of the transition region . to do this we used fully relativistic spin - polarized density functional theory ( dft ) and solved the kohn - sham - dirac equation by the spr - skkr method@xcite . due to the relativistic description of the electrons ,",
    "their spin and orbital degrees of freedom were treated on equal footing and , hence , the calculation gave a full account of the magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "consequently , the bloch wall energy had a minimum .",
    "the equilibrium width as well as the full curve , @xmath215 displayed in fig .",
    "3 . was found to be in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "the novel feature of this kind of electronic theory of a bloch wall , as compared to its conventional phenomenological description @xcite , is that it provides an account of the distortions of the electronic structure due to the presence of the bloch wall as well as its shape , width and energy .",
    "in particular , we have calculated the variations of the size of the magnetic moment , related to the local exchange splitting , and the local densities of states from layer to layer across the transition region .",
    "these results are displayed in figs .",
    "5 . and 6 .",
    "evidently , these changes are small as expected on the grounds that bcc fe is a good moment system .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case they contain the essential information to describe the scattering of electrons by bloch walls as one needs to do in a study of magneto - transport @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our calculations scale linearly with the number of layers , @xmath86 , within the bloch wall . due to this fact we were able to perform calculations for up to 800 layers .",
    "that is to say , for the first time , we were able to describe a mesoscopic magnetic defect in fully first - principles terms .",
