    "the nucleon spin structure function @xmath4 , extracted from the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering with polarization @xcite , if interpreted in the infinite momentum frame , defines a fraction of the nucleon spin carried by quark spins .",
    "accordingly , only about 30% of the nucleon spin is carried by quark spins , which is referred to usually as `` spin crisis '' .",
    "consequently , a lot of experimental and theoretical efforts for the last 20 years were devoted to search for the rest of the nucleon spin , without obvious success , however .",
    "similar results are obtained on the lattice both for nucleons and lowest mesons ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "we have suggested a way to define in a gauge invariant manner and measure the spin content of mesons in the rest frame at different resolution scales , including the infrared ones .",
    "the method is based on the unitary transformation from the complete and orthogonal chiral quark - antiquark basis to the complete and orthogonal @xmath1 basis in the rest frame @xcite . using a set of interpolators that transform according to different chiral representations @xcite",
    ", one can measure on the lattice a ratio of couplings of different interpolators to a given state in the rest frame .",
    "this ratio determines a mixture of different chiral representations in the meson wave functions .",
    "then , given this ratio and using a unitary transformation from the chiral basis to the angular momentum basis , one obtains the angular momentum content of a meson in the rest frame .",
    "the result was that the angular momentum content of the @xmath2-meson in the rest frame is given approximately by the @xmath3 wave , without obvious trace of the spin crisis .",
    "then a natural question is which of the definitions does reflect the spin content of a hadron ?",
    "below we overview both principal aspects of the method as well as the numerical results using as an example the @xmath2-meson .",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath0 states with unbroken chiral symmetry transform according to two chiral representations , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these two representations form a complete and orthogonal basis .",
    "the state that transforms as @xmath8 can be created from the vacuum by the vector current , @xmath9 and the state that belongs to the @xmath7 representation can be created by the pseudotensor operator , @xmath10    in the continuum the physical @xmath2-meson with broken chiral symmetry can be created from the vacuum by both operators and the corresponding amplitudes are given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vector meson state with the mass @xmath13 , momentum @xmath14 and polarization @xmath15 .",
    "the vector current is conserved , consequently the vector coupling constant @xmath16 is scale - independent .",
    "the pseudotensor `` current '' is not conserved and is subject to a nonzero anomalous dimension .",
    "consequently the pseudotensor coupling @xmath17 manifestly depends on the resolution scale @xmath18 .",
    "the very fact that the @xmath2-meson can be created by the operators that transform according two different chiral representations tells that chiral symmetry is broken and the meson wave function is a superposition of both chiral representations .    in the rest frame",
    "the ratio @xmath19 determines the ratio of the two allowed chiral representations in the @xmath2-meson wave function at a given resolution scale @xmath18 .",
    "such ratio can be measured on the lattice .",
    "given a set of operators @xmath20 above we use the variational method @xcite and calculate a cross - correlation matrix at zero spatial momentum ( i.e. , in the rest frame ) , @xmath21 with the coefficients giving the overlap of the operators with the physical state , @xmath22    with a set of operators spanning a complete and orthogonal basis with respect to some symmetry group , these overlaps ( coupling constants ) give the complete information about symmetry breaking .",
    "the interpolating composite operators @xmath20 are not normalized on the lattice and consequently the absolute values of the coupling constants @xmath23 can not be obtained . however , a ratio of the couplings is a well defined quantity and can be computed as @xcite @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the cross - correlation matrix from ( [ corr_inf ] ) , a sum is implied for the index @xmath26 on the right - hand side and @xmath27 are the eigenvectors obtained from the generalized eigenvalue problem , @xmath28 with @xmath29 being some normalization point in euclidean time .",
    "the ratio ( [ ratio_op_comp ] ) coincides with the ratio of matrix elements ( [ rhov / rhot ] ) with @xmath30 .",
    "the chiral basis in the quark - antiquark system is a complete one and can be connected to the complete angular momentum basis in the rest frame via the unitary transformation @xcite @xmath31 with @xmath32 consequently , if we know the mixture of the two allowed chiral representations in a physical state , then applying the unitary transformation ( [ unitary_1 ] ) we are also able to obtain the angular momentum content of this state in the rest frame .",
    "the mixture of the chiral representations in the @xmath2-meson wave function at the resolution scale @xmath18 is given by ( [ ratio_op_comp ] ) and ( [ rhov / rhot ] ) and can be measured in lattice simulations .    by this",
    "we define what is meant under the angular momentum content of the @xmath2-meson in the rest frame and , consequently , we can answer the question whether or not the spin of the @xmath2-meson is carried by spins of its valence quarks in the rest frame .",
    "the ratio @xmath33 as well as a partial wave content of a hadron are not the renormalization group invariant quantities .",
    "hence they manifestly depend on a resolution scale at which we probe the hadron . if we probe the hadron structure on the lattice with the local interpolators , then we study the hadron decomposition at the scale fixed by the lattice spacing @xmath34 . for a reasonably small @xmath34",
    "this scale is close to the ultraviolet scale .",
    "however , we are interested in the hadron content at the infrared scales , where mass is generated . for this purpose",
    "we can not use a large @xmath34 , because matching with the continuum qcd will be lost .",
    "given a fixed , reasonably small lattice spacing @xmath34 a small resolution scale @xmath35 can be achieved by the gauge - invariant smearing of the point - like interpolators .",
    "we smear every quark field in spatial directions with the gaussian profile over the size @xmath36 in physical units such that @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "1 . then even in the continuum limit @xmath38 we probe the hadron content at the resolution scale fixed by @xmath36 .",
    "such a definition of the resolution is similar to the experimental one , where an external probe is sensitive only to quark fields ( it is blind to gluonic fields ) at a resolution that is determined by the momentum transfer in spatial directions .",
    "definition , title=\"fig : \" ]   definition , title=\"fig : \" ]    we use three different smearing radii r for the quark fields both in the source and sink .",
    "the  narrow \" smearing width ( index @xmath39 ) varies between 0.33 and 0.36 fm , depending on the set of configurations .",
    "the  wide \" smearing radius ( index @xmath40 ) lies between 0.66 and 0.69 fm and the  ultrawide \" one is 0.81 - 0.85 fm ( index @xmath41 ) .",
    "hence we can study the hadron structure at resolutions 0.33 fm - 0.85 fm .",
    "consequently we have the following set of the interpolating operators @xmath42 where @xmath43 is one of the spatial dirac matrices and @xmath44 is the @xmath45-matrix in ( euclidean ) time direction .",

    "the lattice size is @xmath52 .",
    "we use dynamical gauge configurations with two mass - degenerate light quarks . with the lattice spacing @xmath53",
    "fm the spatial volume of the lattice is @xmath54 @xmath55 . in our present study",
    "we limit ourselves to the @xmath2 and @xmath49 states . for details on the simulation",
    "we refer the reader to the table [ tab : sim ] and to @xcite .    for the sets",
    "a and c we construct @xmath50 correlation matrices ( i.e. , with both vector and pseudotensor interpolators using narrow and wide smearing radii ) , while for the sets b1 and b2 we study the @xmath51 correlation matrix ( with narrow , wide and ultrawide smearings for both vector and pseudotensor operators ) as well as different @xmath50 sub - matrices .    in fig . [",
    "fig : masses ] we show masses of both the ground state @xmath2-meson and its first excitation @xmath49 extracted from different correlation matrices .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 of the two allowed chiral representations in the @xmath2- and @xmath49-mesons versus the resolution @xmath36 is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "the results obtained from different @xmath50 and @xmath51 correlation matrices are consistent with each other . for the ground state @xmath2",
    "we observe strong chiral symmetry breaking practically at all resolutions ; only in the deep ultraviolet @xmath57 , where chiral symmetry is unbroken , the tensor `` current '' decouples from the @xmath2-meson . for the @xmath49 the tensor operator",
    "decouples much faster towards the ultraviolet than for the @xmath2-meson .",
    "this shows that the wave functions of these two states are significantly different and the chiral symmetry breaking is different in both states . at the scale of @xmath58 fm of the hadron size , i.e. , at which the hadron mass is generated ,",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in the @xmath49 state is less essential than in the ground state .    given this ratio and the unitary transformation from the chiral basis to the angular momentum basis ( [ unitary_1 ] ) one can obtain the partial wave content of both states . for the @xmath2 meson it is approximately @xmath59 .",
    "hence the ground state in the infrared is practically a pure @xmath3 state with a tiny admixture of the @xmath60 wave .",
    "consequently in the rest frame the spin of the @xmath2-meson is almost completely carried by spins of its valence quarks .",
    "no trace of the `` spin crisis '' is observed . in this our definition",
    "we do not separate contributions of quarks and gluons into hadron spin . in the confining regime , where the gauge invariance and the quark - gluon interaction are of crucial importance , it is not possible to separate both contributions into total spin in a sensible gauge - invariant manner ; after all the quark - gluon interaction is a consequence of the gauge invariance .",
    "the spin of the @xmath2-meson in the rest frame is carried by spins of its valence quarks dressed by gluons .",
    "the gluonic field is important for the angular momentum generation , because it is this field that provides chiral symmetry breaking and that is responsible for most of the hadron mass .    in the excited @xmath2-meson",
    "there is a significant contribution of the @xmath60 wave . in the latter case",
    "the angular momentum content is between the following two lower and upper bound values . for the lower bound it is @xmath61 and for the upper bound",
    "it is @xmath62 .",
    "this once again demonstrates that the first excitation of the @xmath2-meson can not be considered a pure radial excitation of the ground state @xmath2",
    ". obviously , both radial and orbital degrees of freedom are excited which reflects yet unknown dynamics of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .     a ratio of the vector to the pseudotensor couplings versus a resolution scale @xmath36 , as extracted from all @xmath50 and @xmath51 correlation matrices .",
