    "in recent years , there has been much progress in simulating the structure and dynamics of large molecules at the atomic level , which may include up to thousands and millions of atoms @xcite .",
    "for example , amorphous polymers may have segments each with 10000 atoms @xcite which associate to form partially crystalline lamellae , random coil regions , and interfaces between these regions , each of which may contribute with special mechanical and chemical properties to the system .    with increasing computer powers nowadays it became possible to study molecular systems of enormous sizes which were not imaginable just several years ago .",
    "for example in @xcite a molecular dynamics simulations of the complete satellite tobacco mosaic virus was performed which includes up to 1 million of atoms . in that paper",
    "the stability of the whole virion and of the rna core alone were demonstrated , and a pronounced instability was shown for the capsid without the rna .",
    "the study of structure and dynamics of macromolecules often implies the calculation of the potential energy surface for the system .",
    "the potential energy surface of a macromolecule carries a lot of useful information about the system .",
    "for example from the potential energy landscape it is possible to estimate the characteristic times for the conformational changes @xcite and for fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the potential energy surface of a macromolecular system can be used for studying the thermodynamical processes in the system such as phase transitions @xcite . in proteins ,",
    "the potential energy surface is related to one of the most intriguing problems of protein physics : protein folding @xcite .",
    "the rate constants for complex biochemical reactions can also be established from the analysis of the potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy surface and molecular dynamics simulations often implies the evaluation of pairwise interactions .",
    "the direct method for evaluating these potentials is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles in the system .",
    "this places a severe restraint on the treatable size of the system . during the last two decades many different methods",
    "have been suggested which provide a linear dependence of the computational cost with respect to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the most widely used algorithm of this kind is the fast multipole method ( fmm ) @xcite .",
    "the critical size of the system at which this method becomes computationally faster than the exact method is accuracy dependent and is very sensitive to the slope in the @xmath1 dependence of the computational cost . in refs .",
    "@xcite critical sizes ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 have been reported .",
    "many discrepancies of the estimates in the critical size arise from differences in the effort of optimizing the algorithm and the underlying code .",
    "however , it is also important to optimize the methods themselves with respect to the required accuracy .",
    "the fmm is based on the systematic organization of multipole representations of a local charge distribution , so that each particle interacts with local expansions of the potential .",
    "originally fmm was introduced in @xcite by greengard and rokhlin .",
    "later , greengard s method has been implemented in various forms .",
    "schmidt and lee @xcite have produced a version based upon the spherical multipoles for both periodic and nonperiodic systems .",
    "zhou and johnson have implemented the fmm for use on parallel computers @xcite , while board _",
    "et al _ have reported both serial and parallel versions of the fmm @xcite .",
    "ding _ et al _ introduced a version of the fmm that relies upon cartesian rather than spherical multipoles @xcite , which they applied to very large scale molecular dynamics calculations .",
    "additionally they modified greengard s definition of the nearest neighbors to increase the proportion of interactions evaluated via local expansions .",
    "et al _ also developed a cartesian based fmm program @xcite , primarily to treat periodic systems described by molecular mechanics potentials . in both cases",
    "only low order multipoles were employed , since high accuracy was not sought .    in the present paper",
    "we suggest a new method for calculating the interaction energy between macromolecules .",
    "our method also provides a linear scaling of the computational costs with the size of the system and is based on the multipole expansion of the potential .",
    "however , the underlying ideas are quite different from the fmm .    assuming that atoms from different macromolecules interact via a pairwise coulomb potential , we expand the potential around the centers of the molecules and build a two center multipole expansion using bipolar harmonics algebra .",
    "finally , we obtain a general expression which can be used for calculating the energy and forces between the fragments .",
    "this approach is different from the one used in the fmm , where the so - called translational operators were used to expand the potential around a shifted center .",
    "note that the final expression , which we suggest in our theory was not discussed before within the fmm .",
    "similar expressions were discussed since the earlier 50 s ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these papers",
    "the two center multipole expansion was considered as a new form of coulomb potential expansion , but the expansion was never applied to the study of macromolecular systems .",
    "we consider the interaction of macromolecules via coulomb potential since this is the only long - range interaction in macromolecules , which is important for the description of the potential energy surface at large distances .",
    "other interaction terms in macromolecular systems are of the short - range type and become important when macromolecules get close to each other @xcite . at large distances these terms can be neglected .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the method based on the two center multipole expansion can be used for computing the interaction energy between complex macromolecular systems . in section",
    "[ theory ] we present the formalism which lies behind the two center multipole expansion method . in subsection [ compcoulomb ]",
    "we analyze the behavior of the computation cost of this method and establish the critical sizes of the system , when the two center multipole expansion method demands less computer time than the exact energy calculation approach . in subsection [ compfmm ]",
    "we compare the results of our calculation with the results obtained within the framework of the fmm . in section [ accur ]",
    "we discuss the accuracy of the two center multipole expansion method .",
    "in this section we present the formalism , which underlies the two center multipole expansion method , which will be further referred to as the tcm method .",
    "let us consider two multi atomic systems , which we will denote as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the pairwise coulomb interaction energy of those systems can be written as follows :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the total number of atoms in systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the charges of atoms @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the system @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , @xmath13 is the vector interconnecting the center of system @xmath4 with the center of system @xmath5 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the vectors describing the position of charges @xmath11 and @xmath12 with respect to the centers of the system @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the centers of both systems can be any suitable points of each of the molecules .",
    "it is natural to define them as the centers of mass of the corresponding systems , but in some cases another choice might be more convenient ( see for example @xcite , where we have applied the tcm method for studying fragmentation of alanine dipeptide ) .    expression ( [ coulomb ] ) can be expanded into a series of spherical harmonics .",
    "the expansion depends on the vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case when    @xmath16    holds for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this particular case is important , because it describes well separated charge distributions , and can be used for modeling the interaction between complex objects at large distances . in this case",
    "the expansion of ( [ coulomb ] ) reads as @xcite :    @xmath17    according to @xcite the function    @xmath18    can be expanded into series of bipolar harmonics :    @xmath19    where a bipolar harmonic is defined as follows :    @xmath20    here @xmath21 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients , which can be transformed to the @xmath22- symbol notation as follows :    @xmath23    using equations ( [ caseiii]),([3j ] ) and ( [ bipolar ] ) we can rewrite expansion ( [ spherharm_exp1 ] ) as follows :    @xmath24    the multipole moments of systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined as follows :    @xmath25    summing equation ( [ spherharm_exp2 ] ) over @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and accounting only for the first @xmath26 multipoles in both systems , we obtain :    @xmath27    this expression describes the electrostatic energy of the system in terms of a two center multipole expansion .",
    "note , that this expansion is only valid when the condition @xmath28 holds for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 , otherwise more sophisticated expansions have to be considered , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "@xmath26 is the principal multipole number , which determines the number of multipoles in the expansion .",
    "in this section we discuss the computational efficiency of the tcm method . for this purpose",
    "we have analyzed the time required for computing the coulomb interaction energy between two systems of charges and the time required for the energy calculation within the framework of the tcm method for different system sizes , and for different values of the principal multipole number .",
    "for the study of the computational efficiency of the tcm method we have considered the interaction between two systems ( we denote them as @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) of randomly distributed charges , for which the condition eq .",

    "the charges in both systems were randomly distributed within the spheres of radii @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively and the distance between the centers of mass of the two systems was chosen as @xmath35 .",
    "the computational time needed for the energy calculations is proportional to the number of operations required .",
    "thus , the time needed for the coulomb energy calculation ( ce calculation ) can be estimated as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a constant depending on the computer processor power and on the efficiency of the code , @xmath38 . from equation ( [ timecoul ] ) it follows that the computational cost of the ce calculation grows proportionally to the second power of the system size .    for large systems",
    "the tcm method becomes more efficient because it provides a linear scaling with the system size .",
    "the time needed for the energy calculation reads as follows :    @xmath39    where the first term , @xmath40 , corresponds to the computer time needed for allocating arrays in memory and tabulating the computationally expensive functions like @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the time needed for evaluation of the spherical harmonic at given @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is a numerical coefficient , which depends on the processor power and on the efficiency of the code . in general",

    "it is seen that @xmath46 varies only slightly for all system sizes considered , being equal to @xmath53 @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the expression for the time needed for the energy calculation within the framework of the tcm method reads as :    @xmath54    note , that @xmath55 @xmath49 is larger than @xmath48 @xmath49 , since in one turn of the tcm method more algebraic operations have to be done , than in one turn of the ce calculation .    from the analysis performed in this section it is clear that the tcm method can give a significant gain in the computation time .",

    "we have generated two random charge distributions of different size and calculated the interaction energies between them as well as the required computation time using the fmm and the tcm methods .",

    "each point in fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] corresponds to a particular charge distribution . for each system size ten",

    "the time of the fmm calculation depends on the charge distribution , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] .",
    "note that for a given system size the calculation time of the fmm can change by more than a factor of 5 , depending on the charge distribution ( see points for @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] ) .    for",
    "all system sizes fmm requires some minimal computer time for calculating the energy of the system , which increases with the growth of system size ( see fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the minimal fmm computation time with the computation time required for the tcm method shows that the tcm method appears to be significantly faster than the fmm . for @xmath60 fmm",
    "requires at least 2.15 seconds to compute the energy , while tcm method requires 0.53 seconds , being approximately 4 times faster .",
    "the results of the tcm method calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] , were obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "the analysis of relative errors presented in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fmm_vs_tcm ] shows that with this principal multipole number it is possible to calculate the energy between two systems with an error of less than 1 % for almost arbitrary charge distribution .",
    "note that for the same charge distributions the error of the fmm is much more , being about 5 % in almost all of the considered systems .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the tcm method is more efficient and more accurate than the classical fmm .",
    "it is important to mention that in the traditional implementation , fmm calculates the total electrostatic energy of the system while tcm method was developed for studying interaction energy between system fragments .",
    "it is possible to modify the fmm to study only interaction energies between different parts of the system .",
    "however , the computation cost of the modified fmm is expected to be higher than of the tcm method .",
    "this happens because , within the framework of the modified fmm method , the field created by one fragment of the system should be expanded in the multipole series and the interactions of the resulting multipole moments with the charges from another fragment should be calculated .",
    "thus the computation cost of this method will be proportional to @xmath62 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of particles in two fragments , while the tcm method is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the computation cost of the modified version of the fmm depends quadratically on the size of the system , because in this method the interacting fragments should be considered as two independent cells , while traditional fmm uses a hierarchical subdivision of the whole system into cells to achieve linear scaling .",
    "so far we have considered only the interaction between two multi particle systems in _ vacuo _ , and demonstrated the efficiency of the tcm method in this case , although the tcm method can also be applied to the larger number of interacting systems .",
    "the study of structure and dynamics of biomolecular systems consisting of several components ( i.e an ensemble of proteins , dna , macromolecules in solution ) is a separate topic , which is beyond the scope of this paper and deserves a separate investigation .",
    "we have calculated the interaction energy between two proteins within the framework of the tcm method and compared it with the exact coulomb energy value . on the basis of this comparison",
    "we have concluded about the accuracy of the tcm method .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied the interaction energy between the porcine pancreatic trypsin and the soybean trypsin inhibitor proteins ( protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite entry 1avw @xcite ) .",
    "trypsins are digestive enzymes produced in the pancreas in the form of inactive trypsinogens .",
    "they are then secreted into the small intestine , where they are activated by another enzyme into trypsins .",
    "the resulting trypsins themselves activate more trypsinogens ( autocatalysis ) .",
    "members of the trypsin family cleave proteins at the carboxyl side ( or `` c - terminus '' ) of the amino acids lysine and arginine .",
    "porcine pancreatic trypsin is a archetypal example .",
    "its natural non - covalent inhibitor ( porcine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor ) inhibits the enzyme s activity in the pancreas , protecting it from self - digestion .",
    "trypsin is also inhibited non - covalently by the soybean trypsin inhibitor from the soya bean plant , although this inhibitor is unrelated to the porcine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family of inhibitors .",
    "although the biological function of the soybean trypsin inhibitor is mostly unknown it is assumed to help defend the plant from insect attack by interfering with the insect digestive system .",
    "the structure of both proteins is shown in fig .",
    "[ belki ] . the coordinate frame used for our computations",
    "is marked in the figure .",
    "this coordinate frame is consistent with the standard coordinate frame used in the pdb .",
    "we use this particular example as a model system in order to demonstrate the possible use of the tcm method . therefore environmental effects are omitted and we consider only the protein - protein interaction _ in vacuo_. the porcine pancreatic trypsin and the soybean trypsin inhibitor include 223 and 177 amino acids respectively .",
    "both proteins include 5847 atoms .",
    "thus for such system size the tcm method is faster than the ce calculation if @xmath64 ( see tab .  [ peresech ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the interaction energy between the porcine pancreatic trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor as a function of distance between the centers of masses of the fragments , @xmath65 , and the angle @xmath66 , which is determined as the angle between the x - axis and the vector @xmath67 ( see fig .

    "[ peresech ] ) , we present these surfaces in order to stress the convergence of the tcm method .",
    "in the present paper we have proposed a new method for the calculation of the coulomb interaction energy between pairs of macromolecular objects .",
    "the suggested method provides a linear scaling of the computational costs with the size of the system and is based on the two center multipole expansion of the potential . analyzing the dependence of the required computer time on the system size , we have established the critical sizes at which our method becomes more efficient than the direct calculation of the coulomb energy .",
    "the comparison of efficiency of the tcm method with the efficiency of fmm allows us to conclude that the tcm method has proved to be faster and more accurate than the classical fmm .",
    "the method based on the two center multipole expansion can be used for the efficient computation of the interaction energy between complex macromolecular systems . to determine that we have considered the interaction between two proteins : porcine pancreatic trypsin and the soybean trypsin inhibitor .",
    "the accuracy of the method has been discussed in detail .",
    "it has been shown that accounting of only four multipoles in both proteins gives an error in the interaction energy less than 5 % .",
    "the tcm method is especially useful for studying dynamics of rigid molecules , but it can also be adopted for studying dynamics of flexible molecules . in this work we have developed a method for the efficient calculation of the interaction energy between pairs of large multi particle systems , e.g. macromolecules , being in _",
    "vacuo_. the investigation of biomolecular systems consisting of several components ( i.e complexes of proteins , dna , macromolecules in solution ) and the extension of the tcm method for these cases deserves a separate investigation .",
    "if a system of interest consists of several interacting molecules being placed in a solution , one can use the tcm method to describe the interaction between the molecules and then to take account of the solution as implicit solvent .",
    "this can be achieved using for example the formalism of the poisson - bolzmann @xcite , similar to how it was implemented for the description of the antigen - antibody binding / unbinding process @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is to split the whole system into boxes and account for the solvent explicitly by calculating the interactions between the boxes and the molecules of interest .",
    "this can be achieved by using the tcm method or a combination of the fmm and the tcm methods . in this case",
    "the fmm can be used for the calculation of the resulting effective multipole moment of the solvent , while the tcm method is much better suitable for the description of the macromolecules energetics and dynamics .",
    "note that all of the suggested methodologies provide linear scaling of the computation time on the system size .",
    "the results of this work can be utilized for the description of complex molecular systems such as viruses , dna , protein complexes , etc and their dynamics .",
    "many dynamical features and phenomena of these systems are caused by the electrostatic interaction between their various fragments and thus the use of the two center multipole expansion method should give a significant gain in their computation costs .",
