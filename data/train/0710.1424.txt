    "the investigation of the landau - gauge gluon propagator @xmath3 in lattice qcd dates back to more than 20 years . despite the efforts made by a number of authors , there are questions which remain to be answered . for large momenta ,",
    "let us say @xmath4 gev , the results from different groups provide a consistent picture of the propagator and agree well with calculations performed using other non - perturbative techniques .",
    "on the other hand , the infrared limit is still an open issue and has been a field of intense research in the last years ( see the contributions to this conference , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) . from the point of view of lattice simulations ,",
    "the questions to be answered yet are numerous and sometimes are even not easy to handle with .",
    "for example , it is still under debate how to deal with the gribov ambiguity in lattice simulations , and how close present lattice data come to landau - gauge gluodynamics in the continuum and infinite - volume limit .    in order to access the infrared limit of the gluon propagator , two of us ( o.o . and p.j.s . )",
    "recently proposed and explored the use of large asymmetric lattices @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 with @xmath6",
    ". the price of relying on such kind of lattices are the control , or the lack of it , of additional finite - volume effects coming from a breaking of the @xmath7 symmetry , a remnant of the @xmath8 continuum symmetry on a symmetric hypercubic lattice .",
    "when previous studies on symmetric lattices have shown strong finite - volume effects in the infrared region @xcite , the situation is more dramatic for asymmetric lattices .",
    "for example , there the gluon dressing function @xmath9 computed at equal time - like and spatial momenta are not necessarily compatible within pure statistical errors in the low - momentum region .",
    "on the other hand , the access to very low momenta is much more computationally intensive in simulations on symmetric lattices compared to those on asymmetric ones .",
    "therefore , if somehow the asymmetry - induced finite - volume effects were brought under control , data at much lower momenta than currently available could be obtained .",
    "indeed , then still the infinite volume limit has to be taken , but in a situation where more data were available in the infrared momentum region .",
    "having now access to a considerably larger spatial volume for the asymmetric case , in this study we report on some first results obtained comparing data on symmetric and asymmetric lattices , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we look for regions in the lattice momentum space where the differences between time - like and spatial momenta disappear and where not . for our simulations we use the standard wilson gauge action with",
    "@xmath14 fixed .",
    "this value corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing of about @xmath15 . to relate our data at the different lattice momenta to their continuum counterparts we use @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lattice extent in direction @xmath18 .",
    "definitions and details on the gauge fixing are given in @xcite and for the @xmath19 data in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "whenever possible , a @xmath20 average over equivalent momenta is performed .",
    "the gluon propagator and dressing function were computed for 39 configurations using a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "the data shows discretization effects similar to those seen in the symmetric lattices .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that for momenta above @xmath21 gev the propagator is not a simple function of @xmath22 alone . the traditional approach is to apply momenta cuts @xcite which reduce the dependence of the propagator and the dressing function on other @xmath7 ( in our case @xmath20 ) invariants to a unique curve .",
    "this is better seen in the gluon dressing function . in order to illustrate this effect , in fig .",
    "[ eq : assimetrica ] we plot the gluon dressing function for different choices of momenta ( purely time - like and different cuts of spatial momenta ) .",
    "the plot shows that , within our limited statistics , there is very good agreement between the dressing functions computed using purely spatial on - axis and purely temporal momenta .",
    "the figure does not include the dressing function for all purely spatial momenta .",
    "however , in what concerns the purely spatial momenta , the gluon dressing function for on - axis momenta evolves typically along the lower edge of the spatial ( including off - axis ) momentum data .",
    "the diagonal choice of momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ the cylindrical cut @xcite where @xmath23 ( see the left plot in fig .  [",
    "eq : assimetrica ] ) picks up an unique propagator which is slightly above the propagator for the on - axis choice for momenta at @xmath24 larger than @xmath25 gev .",
    "note that this `` democratic '' choice of momenta has been successfully used to suppress discretization effects such that data from different volumes and lattice spacings match at larger momenta .         in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ eq : assimetrica ] we also show two naive generalizations to the asymmetric case of the on - axis case and of a `` democratic '' choice of momenta ( the cylinder cut ) , labelled as @xmath26 and @xmath27 cuts .",
    "the former includes momenta only of type @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( softening of on - axis momenta ) , while the latter includes momenta defined around the direction @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this direction is close to the diagonal in the elongated volume ( remember that @xmath33 ) . note that the @xmath26 cut reproduces the results of the symmetric lattice for the on - axis choice of momenta , while the @xmath27 cut follows the symmetric lattice data for the cylindrical and conical cuts . given that the cylindrical and conical cuts seem to reduce the finite - volume effects for momenta above 1 gev , fig .",
    "[ eq : assimetrica ] suggests that for the asymmetric lattices one should use the @xmath27 cut , or a variant of it , for that momentum region .",
    "the gluon dressing function @xmath9 , computed for an ensemble of 50 gauge configurations on a @xmath13 lattice , is given in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ eq : simetrica ] applying various cuts .",
    "the lattice data shows similar discretization effects as for the asymmetric lattice .",
    "this is illustrated in the right plot of the same figure .",
    "there , data for the two lattices @xmath13 and @xmath12 are shown for two different momentum cuts at larger momenta and good agreement is found . moreover , within our limited statistics , the cuts produce similar effects for both lattices where the on - axis data lie in both cases systematically below cylinder - cut data for @xmath4 gev .",
    "lattice is shown on the left hand side .",
    "the right figure compares the same data with those on a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "different cuts have been applied to the data.,title=\"fig : \" ]   lattice is shown on the left hand side .",
    "the right figure compares the same data with those on a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "different cuts have been applied to the data.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ eq : duas ] the lattice gluon dressing function for a @xmath19 and a @xmath13 lattice are compared for momenta below 2 gev .",
    "again , two different cuts ( on - axis and cylindrical ) are considered .",
    "we find that in this momentum range the dressing functions @xmath34 for the two lattice geometries are in good agreement , even though we can not compare at the low - lying momenta .",
    "a comparison with data from larger symmetric lattices is necessary to become more confident in this .",
    "at least , the good matching between 0.5  gev and 2 gev is encouraging in what concerns the use of asymmetric lattices to extract reliable infrared properties in future lattice simulations .     and the @xmath12 lattices for two different momenta cuts .",
    "[ eq : duas ] ]",
    "now we discuss the volume dependence of the propagator @xmath35 as function of the physical momentum @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ eq : varias ] we compare the gluon propagator on one hand and the dressing function on the other hand for various asymmetric lattices , for @xmath13 ( all at @xmath36 ) and for the continuum dyson - schwinger solution of ref .",
    "all propagators were renormalized according to the condition @xmath37 with the choice @xmath38 . for asymmetric lattices ,",
    "the data is for time - like ( on - axis ) momenta . for the symmetric lattice ,",
    "the plot includes only on - axis momenta .",
    "[ eq : varias ] shows that the two results become closer as the lattice volume increases .     at @xmath36 .",
    "compared with the dse solution .",
    "[ eq : varias],title=\"fig : \" ]   at @xmath36 . compared with the dse solution .",
    "[ eq : varias],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in previous investigations it was verified that the lattice gluon dressing function and the continuum dyson - schwinger solution are well described not by a pure power law but by both functions @xmath39 for momenta below @xmath40 mev .",

    "the results give @xmath42 consistently above @xmath61 .",
    "if this really represents the infrared asymptotics , it supports a vanishing @xmath62 limit of the gluon propagator @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , one should keep in mind that the fits to a pure power law provide always a @xmath63 , with @xmath42 increasing with the lattice volume .",

    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 data , the momentum cuts produce similar results for the full range of momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ the gluon propagator / dressing function for on - axis momenta are systematically below cone - cut or cylinder - cut data for @xmath21 gev .",
