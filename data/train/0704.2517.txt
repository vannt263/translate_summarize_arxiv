    "the position @xmath0 at time @xmath1 of one of its particles is determined by its interactions with the other particles and/or with external sources . in a strongly disordered system",
    "these interactions are modelled by a random field .",
    "the statistical description of the system thus involves the definition of an ensemble of realizations .",

    "this is represented asymptotically ( @xmath3 ) by a simple increasing function of time :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 the value of the \" _ diffusion exponent \" _",

    "it will be seen in the forthcoming sections that the concept of `` strange transport '' involves much more than a simple statement about the behaviour of the msd .",
    "all present theories of strange transport are of stochastic nature .  from the very voluminous literature",
    "we only cite here a few of the more comprehensive , physically oriented review papers and books : @xcite  - @xcite , where additional references will be found .",
    "as stated in @xcite , transport theories ( e.g. , for fluids or plasmas ) can be constructed on three levels .",
    "@xmath8 ) a purely statistical mechanical theory would be based on the kinetic equation for a set of interacting charged particles , combined with maxwell s equations .",
    "this would be the most fundamental description , but becomes impossibly complicated in practice .",
    "@xmath9 ) the next level of description would be a compromise , based on a `` semi - dynamical '' model of particles moving according to the laws of mechanics ( newton s equation ) , but under the action of a _ fluctuating field _",
    ", representing the action of the turbulent environment .",
    "this leads to stochastic ordinary differential equations of the langevin * *  * * type .",
    "more specifically , we consider * v - langevin equations * @xcite , * *  * * _ _ i.e . _ _",
    "equations for the position of a `` particle '' :    @xmath10,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{x% } ( 0)=0   \\label{eeq.3}\\ ] ]    where the right hand side represents a fluctuating velocity field , defined by its statistical properties .",

    "the characteristics of this equation are precisely the v - langevin equations ( eeq.3 ) :    @xmath13    due to the property ( [ eeq.4 ] ) this equation is equivalent to the following :    @xmath14 = 0 .",
    "\\label{eeq.6}\\ ] ]    this equation ensures the conservation of the number of particles , and is rightly interpreted as a kinetic equation .",
    "@xmath15 ) the last level of description is the level of * continuous time random walk * * ( ctrw ) * theories and * fractional diffusion equations ( fde ) * , in which the deterministic dynamical laws are completely given up , and replaced by a purely random process .",
    "all these concepts will be defined and used in the forthcoming sections .",
    "these three levels are , of course , interrelated : each one of them should be justifiable as an approximation of the more fundamental one .",
    "the strange transport theories associated with ctrw and with fde have been very successful in recent years in modelling many peculiar behaviors observed , among other fields , in plasma and fusion physics .",
    "there is , however , still a serious gap in justifying these purely stochastic models on the basis of a molecular theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , theories of the type @xmath16 ) , or at least @xmath9 ) .",
    "in @xcite we treated several models exhibiting strange transport , showing that a stochastic ctrw can be associated with a semi - dynamical v - langevin equation under certain limiting conditions .",
    "all these models ( diffusion in a fluctuating electrostatic field or in a fluctuating magnetic field ) were either diffusive , or _ subdiffusive_. one of the purposes of the present work is to try to determine whether there exist v - langevin equations leading to _ temporal superdiffusive behavior _ and associating them with a ctrw  or with a fractional diffusion equation .",
    "a first work following the same philosophy was done by west et al .",
    "west - grigo . in that paper a specially simplified model of a one - dimensional",
    ", two - state ctrw was used .",
    "this means that a `` particle '' performs a ctrw in one dimension , moving with a velocity that is constant in absolute value : @xmath17 .",
    "the particle moves during a given ( random ) time , after which it suddenly jumps and reverses its velocity .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function is given as an algebraically decaying function of time .",
    "in a first step of their work , the jumps are supposed to be instantaneous events .",
    "this model leads already to possible superdiffusion of time - fractional type .",
    "the authors are , however , looking for a superdiffusive regime of lvy type ( _ space - fractional diffusion)_.  they then modify their model .",
    "the jump pdf and the waiting time pdf of the ctrw are now _ linked _ by assuming that the particles move during their `` jump '' with final velocity @xmath17 : thus longer jumps are `` penalized '' by longer durations ( `` _ _ lvy walk _ _ '' rather than `` lvy flight '' , @xcite ) .",
    "it appears to us that the limitation to two states makes the model unadapted to describing the motion of a physical particle ; it is , however , necessary for the definition of the lvy walk in their model . in the next section",
    "we show that the assumption about the two states can be dropped , and the velocity can be considered as a general random function of time : @xmath18 [ secs .",
    "[ v(t ) ] - [ algeb correl ] ] .",
    "the model can be further extended by considering a _ velocity field _ : @xmath19 ( secs .",
    "[ v - field ] and following ) .",
    "but this case leads to additional difficulties , because it requires the determination of the _ lagrangian velocity correlation _ , a problem that is well known as a basic difficulty of turbulence theory . here",
    "we shall consider only the crudest approximation for the latter quantity , but the application of more precise methods that were recently developed in this field can be envisaged .",
    "in the forthcoming text , the abbreviation `` _ _ pdf _ _ '' denotes a `` probability distribution function '' ; the symbol may equivalently be translated as `` probability density function '' .    in the _ continuous time random walk _",
    "model one considers a particle which at time zero makes an instantaneous jump from position @xmath20 to @xmath21 , then waits at the new position during time @xmath22 , then jumps again to a new position , where it waits , etc .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath1 are random quantities . in all forthcoming calculations ,",

    "this means that @xmath32 is independent of @xmath1 , and @xmath30 is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "processes such as lvy walks @xcite or the vmsc  model @xcite are not discussed here .    a derived function that plays an important role is the _ memory kernel _ @xmath34 ( in laplace representation ) :    @xmath35    this standard ctrw has been solved exactly by @xcite in 1965.let @xmath36 be the pdf of finding the walker at position @xmath23 at time @xmath1 , given that it started certainly at the origin @xmath37 at time @xmath38 [ _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath41 . clearly , from this definition , @xmath36 is the _ propagator _ ( or _ green s function _ ) of the ctrw process .",
