    "the last five years have seen the coming of age of modern cosmology , a mature branch of science based on the hot big bang theory and the inflationary paradigm . in particular",
    ", we can now define rather precisely a standard model of cosmology , where the basic parameters are determined within small uncertainties , of just a few percent , thanks to a host of experiments and observations .",
    "this precision era of cosmology has become possible thanks to important experimental developments in all fronts , from measurements of supernovae at high redshifts to the microwave background anisotropies , as well as to the distribution of matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    in these lecture notes",
    "i will first introduce the basic concepts and equations associated with hot big bang cosmology , defining the main cosmological parameters and their corresponding relationships .",
    "then i will address in detail the three fundamental observations that have shaped our present knowledge : the recent acceleration of the universe , the distribution of matter on large scales and the anisotropies in the microwave background .",
    "together these observations allow the precise determination of a handful of cosmological parameters , in the context of the inflationary plus cold dark matter paradigm .",
    "our present understanding of the universe is based upon the successful hot big bang theory , which explains its evolution from the first fraction of a second to our present age , around 13.6 billion years later .",
    "this theory rests upon four robust pillars , a theoretical framework based on general relativity , as put forward by albert einstein  @xcite and alexander a. friedmann  @xcite in the 1920s , and three basic observational facts : first , the expansion of the universe , discovered by edwin p.",
    "hubble  @xcite in the 1930s , as a recession of galaxies at a speed proportional to their distance from us .",
    "second , the relative abundance of light elements , explained by george gamow  @xcite in the 1940s , mainly that of helium , deuterium and lithium , which were cooked from the nuclear reactions that took place at around a second to a few minutes after the big bang , when the universe was a few times hotter than the core of the sun . third , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the afterglow of the big bang , discovered in 1965 by arno a. penzias and robert w. wilson  @xcite as a very isotropic blackbody radiation at a temperature of about 3 degrees kelvin , emitted when the universe was cold enough to form neutral atoms , and photons decoupled from matter , approximately 380,000 years after the big bang . today",
    ", these observations are confirmed to within a few percent accuracy , and have helped establish the hot big bang as the preferred model of the universe .",
    "modern cosmology begun as a quantitative science with the advent of einstein s general relativity and the realization that the geometry of space - time , and thus the general attraction of matter , is determined by the energy content of the universe  @xcite @xmath0 these non - linear equations are simply too difficult to solve without invoking some symmetries of the problem at hand : the universe itself .",
    "we live on earth , just 8 light - minutes away from our star , the sun , which is orbiting at 8.5 kpc from the center of our galaxy , cm . ] the milky way , an ordinary galaxy within the virgo cluster , of size a few mpc , itself part of a supercluster of size a few 100 mpc , within the visible universe , approximately 10,000 mpc in size .",
    "although at small scales the universe looks very inhomogeneous and anisotropic , the deepest galaxy catalogs like 2df grs and sdss suggest that the universe on large scales ( beyond the supercluster scales ) is very homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "moreover , the cosmic microwave background , which contains information about the early universe , indicates that the deviations from homogeneity and isotropy were just a few parts per million at the time of photon decoupling .",
    "therefore , we can safely impose those symmetries to the univerge at large and determine the corresponding evolution equations .",
    "the most general metric satisfying homogeneity and isotropy is the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , written here in terms of the invariant geodesic distance @xmath1 in four dimensions  @xcite @xmath2 , everywhere , unless specified , and a metric signature @xmath3 . ]",
    "@xmath4\\,,\\ ] ] characterized by just two quantities , a _ scale factor _ @xmath5 , which determines the physical size of the universe , and a constant @xmath6 , which characterizes the _ spatial _ curvature of the universe , @xmath7 spatially open , flat and closed universes have different three - geometries .",
    "light geodesics on these universes behave differently , and thus could in principle be distinguished observationally , as we shall discuss later . apart from the three - dimensional spatial curvature",
    ", we can also compute a four - dimensional _ space - time _ curvature , @xmath8 depending on the dynamics ( and thus on the matter / energy content ) of the universe , we will have different possible outcomes of its evolution . the universe may expand for ever , recollapse in the future or approach an asymptotic state in between .      the most general matter fluid consistent with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is a perfect fluid , one in which an observer _ comoving with the fluid _ would see the universe around it as isotropic .",
    "the energy momentum tensor associated with such a fluid can be written as  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the pressure and energy density of the fluid at a given time in the expansion , as measured by this comoving observer , and @xmath12 is the comoving four - velocity , satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "for such a comoving observer , the matter content looks isotropic ( in its rest frame ) , @xmath14 the conservation of energy ( @xmath15 ) , a direct consequence of the general covariance of the theory ( @xmath16 ) , can be written in terms of the frw metric and the perfect fluid tensor ( [ perfectfluid ] ) as @xmath17    in order to find explicit solutions , one has to supplement the conservation equation with an _ equation of state _ relating the pressure and the density of the fluid , @xmath18 .",
    "the most relevant fluids in cosmology are barotropic , i.e. fluids whose pressure is linearly proportional to the density , @xmath19 , and therefore the speed of sound is constant in those fluids",
    ".    we will restrict ourselves in these lectures to three main types of barotropic fluids :    * _ radiation _ , with equation of state @xmath20 , associated with relativistic degrees of freedom ( i.e. particles with temperatures much greater than their mass ) . in this case",
    ", the energy density of radiation decays as @xmath21 with the expansion of the universe . *",
    "_ matter _ , with equation of state @xmath22 , associated with nonrelativistic degrees of freedom ( i.e. particles with temperatures much smaller than their mass ) . in this case , the energy density of matter decays as @xmath23 with the expansion of the universe . * _ vacuum energy _",
    ", with equation of state @xmath24 , associated with quantum vacuum fluctuations . in this case , the vacuum energy density remains constant with the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is all we need in order to solve the einstein equations .",
    "let us now write the equations of motion of observers comoving with such a fluid in an expanding universe . according to general relativity",
    ", these equations can be deduced from the einstein equations ( [ einsteinequations ] ) , by substituting the frw metric ( [ frwmetric ] ) and the perfect fluid tensor ( [ perfectfluid ] ) . the @xmath25 component of the einstein equations , together with the @xmath26 component constitute the so - called friedmann equations , @xmath27 these equations contain all the relevant dynamics , since the energy conservation equation ( [ energyconservation ] ) can be obtained from these .",
    "i will now define the most important cosmological parameters .",
    "perhaps the best known is the _ hubble parameter _ or rate of expansion today , @xmath28 .",
    "we can write the hubble parameter in units of 100 kms@xmath29mpc@xmath29 , which can be used to estimate the order of magnitude for the present size and age of the universe , @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 was measured to be in the range @xmath32 for decades , and only in the last few years has it been found to lie within 4% of @xmath33 .",
    "i will discuss those recent measurements in the next section .    using the present rate of expansion",
    ", one can define a _ critical _",
    "density @xmath34 , that which corresponds to a flat universe , @xmath35 & = & 11.26\\,h^2\\ { \\rm protons}/{\\rm m}^3\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 g  is a solar mass unit .",
    "the critical density @xmath34 corresponds to approximately 6 protons per cubic meter , certainly a very dilute fluid !    in terms of the critical density it is possible to define the density parameter @xmath37",
    "whose sign can be used to determine the spatial ( three-)curvature .",
    "closed universes ( @xmath38 ) have @xmath39 , flat universes ( @xmath40 ) have @xmath41 , and open universes ( @xmath42 ) have @xmath43 , no matter what are the individual components that sum up to the density parameter .    in particular , we can define the individual ratios @xmath44 , for matter , radiation , cosmological constant and even curvature , today , @xmath45 for instance , we can evaluate today the radiation component @xmath46 , corresponding to relativistic particles , from the density of microwave background photons , @xmath47 , which gives @xmath48 .",
    "three approximately massless neutrinos would contribute a similar amount .",
    "therefore , we can safely neglect the contribution of relativistic particles to the total density of the universe today , which is dominated either by non - relativistic particles ( baryons , dark matter or massive neutrinos ) or by a cosmological constant , and write the rate of expansion in terms of its value today , as @xmath49 an interesting consequence of these definitions is that one can now write the friedmann equation today , @xmath50 , as a _ cosmic sum rule _ , @xmath51 where we have neglected @xmath46 today .",
    "that is , in the context of a frw universe , the total fraction of matter density , cosmological constant and spatial curvature today must add up to one .",
    "for instance , if we measure one of the three components , say the spatial curvature , we can deduce the sum of the other two .",
    "looking now at the second friedmann equation ( [ evolution ] ) , we can define another basic parameter , the _ deceleration parameter _ , @xmath52\\,,\\ ] ] defined so that it is positive for ordinary matter and radiation , expressing the fact that the universe expansion should slow down due to the gravitational attraction of matter .",
    "we can write this parameter using the definitions of the density parameter for known and unknown fluids ( with density @xmath53 and arbitrary equation of state @xmath54 ) as @xmath55 uniform expansion corresponds to @xmath56 and requires a cancellation between the matter and vacuum energies .",
    "for matter domination , @xmath57 , while for vacuum domination , @xmath58 . as we will see in a moment ,",
    "we are at present probing the time dependence of the deceleration parameter and can determine with some accuracy the moment at which the universe went from a decelerating phase , dominated by dark matter , into an acceleration phase at present , which seems to indicate the dominance of some kind of vacuum energy .",
    "now that we know that the universe is accelerating , one can parametrize the matter / energy content of the universe with just two components : the matter , characterized by @xmath60 , and the vacuum energy @xmath61 .",
    "different values of these two parameters completely specify the universe evolution .",
    "it is thus natural to plot the results of observations in the plane ( @xmath62 ) , in order to check whether we arrive at a consistent picture of the present universe from several different angles ( different sets of cosmological observations ) .    .",
    "the green ( dashed ) line @xmath63 corresponds to a flat universe , @xmath64 , separating open from closed universes .",
    "the blue ( dotted ) line @xmath65 corresponds to uniform expansion , @xmath66 , separating accelerating from decelerating universes .",
    "the violet ( dot - dashed ) line corresponds to critical universes , separating eternal expansion from recollapse in the future .",
    "finally , the red ( continuous ) lines correspond to @xmath67 , beyond which the universe has a bounce.,width=377 ]    moreover , different regions of this plane specify different behaviors of the universe . the boundaries between regions are well defined curves that can be computed for a given model .",
    "i will now describe the various regions and boundaries .",
    "* _ uniform expansion _ ( @xmath56 )",

    "let us first describe the effect that the expansion of the universe has on the objects that live in it . in the absence of other forces but those of gravity , the trajectory of a particle is given by general relativity in terms of the geodesic equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the peculiar velocity . here",
    "@xmath89 is the christoffel connection  @xcite , whose only non - zero component is @xmath90 ; substituting into the geodesic equation , we obtain @xmath91 , and thus the particle s momentum decays with the expansion like @xmath92 . in the case of a photon , satisfying the de broglie relation @xmath93 , one obtains the well known _ photon redshift _ @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the wavelength measured by an observer at time @xmath80 , while @xmath96 is the wavelength emitted when the universe was younger @xmath97 .",
    "normally we measure light from stars in distant galaxies and compare their observed spectra with our laboratory ( restframe ) spectra .",
    "the fraction ( [ redshift ] ) then gives the redshift @xmath98 of the object .",
    "we are assuming , of course , that both the emitted and the restframe spectra are identical , so that we can actually measure the effect of the intervening expansion , i.e. the growth of the scale factor from @xmath99 to @xmath80 , when we compare the two spectra .",
    "note that if the emitting galaxy and our own participated in the expansion , i.e. if our measuring rods ( our rulers ) also expanded with the universe , we would see no effect !",
    "the reason we can measure the redshift of light from a distant galaxy is because our galaxy is a gravitationally bounded object that has decoupled from the expansion of the universe .",
    "it is the distance between galaxies that changes with time , not the sizes of galaxies , nor the local measuring rods .",
    "we can now evaluate the relationship between physical distance and redshift as a function of the rate of expansion of the universe . because of homogeneity we can always choose our position to be at the origin @xmath100 of our spatial section .",
    "imagine an object ( a star ) emitting light at time @xmath99 , at coordinate distance @xmath101 from the origin .",
    "because of isotropy we can ignore the angular coordinates @xmath102 . then the physical distance , to first order , will be @xmath103 .",
    "since light travels along null geodesics  @xcite , we can write @xmath104 , and therefore , @xmath105 if we now taylor expand the scale factor to first order , @xmath106 we find , to first approximation , @xmath107 putting all together we find the famous hubble law @xmath108 which is just a kinematical effect ( we have not included yet any dynamics , i.e. the matter content of the universe ) . note that at low redshift @xmath109 , one is tempted to associate the observed change in wavelength with a doppler effect due to a hypothetical recession velocity of the distant galaxy .",
    "this is only an approximation .",
    "in fact , the redshift can not be ascribed to the relative velocity of the distant galaxy because in general relativity ( i.e. in curved spacetimes ) one can not compare velocities through parallel transport , since the value depends on the path !",
    "if the distance to the galaxy is small , i.e. @xmath110 , the physical spacetime is not very different from minkowsky and such a comparison is approximately valid . as @xmath98 becomes of order one , such a relation is manifestly false : galaxies can not travel at speeds greater than the speed of light ; it is the stretching of spacetime which is responsible for the observed redshift .",
    "[ fig : stretchfactor ]      hubble s law has been confirmed by observations ever since the 1920s , with increasing precision , which have allowed cosmologists to determine the hubble parameter @xmath79 with less and less systematic errors .",
    "nowadays , the best determination of the hubble parameter was made by the hubble space telescope key project  @xcite , @xmath111 km / s / mpc .",
    "this determination is based on objects at distances up to 500 mpc , corresponding to redshifts @xmath112 .",
    "nowadays , we are beginning to probe much greater distances , corresponding to @xmath113 , thanks to type ia supernovae .",
    "these are white dwarf stars at the end of their life cycle that accrete matter from a companion until they become unstable and violently explode in a natural thermonuclear explosion that out - shines their progenitor galaxy .",
    "the intensity of the distant flash varies in time , it takes about three weeks to reach its maximum brightness and then it declines over a period of months .",
    "although the maximum luminosity varies from one supernova to another , depending on their original mass , their environment , etc . , there is a pattern : brighter explosions last longer than fainter ones . by studying the characteristic light curves ,",
    "see fig .  2 , of a reasonably large statistical sample , cosmologists from the supernova cosmology project  @xcite and the high - redshift supernova project  @xcite , are now quite confident that they can use this type of supernova as a standard candle .",
    "since the light coming from some of these rare explosions has travelled a large fraction of the size of the universe , one expects to be able to infer from their distribution the spatial curvature and the rate of expansion of the universe .",

    "in fact , the universe appears to be accelerating instead of decelerating , as was expected from the general attraction of matter , see eq .",
    "( [ decelerationparameter ] ) ; something seems to be acting as a repulsive force on very large scales .",
    "the most natural explanation for this is the presence of a cosmological constant , a diffuse vacuum energy that permeates all space and , as explained above , gives the universe an acceleration that tends to separate gravitationally bound systems from each other .",
    "the best - fit results from the supernova cosmology project  @xcite give a linear combination @xmath125 which is now many sigma away from an eds model with @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , for a flat universe this gives @xmath127 surprising as it may seem , arguments for a significant dark energy component of the universe where proposed long before these observations , in order to accommodate the ages of globular clusters , as well as a flat universe with a matter content below critical , which was needed in order to explain the observed distribution of galaxies , clusters and voids .",

    "@xcite.,width=340 ]    this extra component of the critical density would have to resist gravitational collapse , otherwise it would have been detected already as part of the energy in the halos of galaxies . however ,",
    "if most of the energy of the universe resists gravitational collapse , it is impossible for structure in the universe to grow .",
    "this dilemma can be resolved if the hypothetical dark energy was negligible in the past and only recently became the dominant component . according to general relativity",
    ", this requires that the dark energy have negative pressure , since the ratio of dark energy to matter density goes like @xmath131 . this argument would rule out almost all of the usual suspects , such as cold dark matter , neutrinos , radiation , and kinetic energy , since they all have zero or positive pressure .",
    "thus , we expect something like a cosmological constant , with a negative pressure , @xmath132 , to account for the missing energy .",
    "however , if the universe was dominated by dark matter in the past , in order to form structure , and only recently became dominated by dark energy , we must be able to see the effects of the transition from the deceleration into the acceleration phase in the luminosity of distant type ia supernovae .",
    "this has been searched for since 1998 , when the first convincing results on the present acceleration appeared . however , only recently  @xcite do we have clear evidence of this transition point in the evolution of the universe . this _ coasting point _",

    "6 . substituting into the einstein equations ( [ einsteinequations ] )",
    ", we see that the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy are completely equivalent , @xmath145 , so we can measure the vacuum energy with the observations of the acceleration of the universe , which tells us that @xmath140 .    on the other hand , we can estimate the contribution to the vacuum energy coming from the quantum mechanical zero - point energy of the quantum oscillators associated with the fluctuations of all quantum fields , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the ultraviolet cutoff signaling the scale of new physics . taking the scale of quantum gravity , @xmath148 , as the cutoff , and barring any fortuituous cancellations , then the theoretical expectation ( [ zeropointenergy ] ) appears to be",

    "there must be something seriously wrong in our present understanding of gravity at the most fundamental level .",

    "the snap satellite  @xcite will measure several thousand supernovae at high redshift and therefore map the redshift dependence of both the dark energy density and its equation of state with great precision .",
    "this will allow a much better determination of the cosmological parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in this section i will describe the main concepts associated with ensembles of particles in thermal equilibrium and the brief periods in which the universe fell out of equilibrium . to begin with ,",
    "let me make contact between the covariant energy conservation law ( [ energyconservation ] ) and the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the total energy of the fluid , and @xmath19 is its barotropic pressure .",
    "taking a comoving volume for the universe , @xmath155 , we find @xmath156 where we have used ( [ energyconservation ] ) .",
    "therefore , entropy is conserved during the expansion of the universe , @xmath157 ; i.e. , the expansion is adiabatic even in those epochs in which the equation of state changes , like in the matter - radiation transition ( not a proper phase transition ) . using ( [ energyconservation ] ) , we can write @xmath158 thus , our universe expands like a gaseous fluid in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath159 .",
    "this temperature decreases like that of any expanding fluid , in a way that is inversely proportional to the cubic root of the volume .",
    "this implies that in the past the universe was necessarily denser and hotter .",
    "as we go back in time we reach higher and higher temperatures , which implies that the mean energy of plasma particles is larger and thus certain fundamental reactions are now possible and even common , giving rise to processes that today we can only attain in particle physics accelerators .",
    "that is the reason why it is so important , for the study of early universe , to know the nature of the fundamental interactions at high energies , and the basic connection between cosmology and high energy particle physics .",
    "however , i should clarify a misleading statement that is often used : `` high energy particle physics colliders reproduce the early universe '' by inducing collisions among relativistic particles .",

    "the interactions within the detectors of the great particle physics accelerators occur typically in the perturbative regime , locally , and very far from thermal equilibrium , lasting a minute fraction of a second ; on the other hand , the same interactions occurred within a hot plasma in equilibrium in the early universe while it was expanding adiabatically and its duration could be significantly larger , with a distribution in energy that has nothing to do with those associated with particle accelerators .",
    "what is true , of course , is that the fundamental parameters corresponding to those interactions @xmath160 masses and couplings @xmath160 are assumed to be the same , and therefore present terrestrial experiments can help us imagine what it could have been like in the early universe , and make predictions about the evolution of the universe , in the context of an expanding plasma a high temperatures and high densities , and in thermal equilibrium .      in order to understand the thermodynamical behaviour of a plasma of different species of particles at high temperatures we will consider a gas of particles with @xmath161 internal degrees of freedom weakly interacting .",

    "there is nothing in the theory that determines this parameter a priori .",

    "he argued that the most natural initial condition for the spatial curvature should have been the planck scale curvature , @xmath195 , where the planck length is @xmath196 cm , that is , 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the present size of the universe , @xmath197 cm . a universe with this immense curvature would have collapsed within a planck time , @xmath198 s , again 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the present age of the universe , @xmath199 s. therefore , the flatness problem is also related to the age problem , why is it that the universe is so old and flat when , under ordinary circumstances ( based on the fundamental scale of gravity ) it should have lasted only a planck time and reached a size of order the planck length ? as we will see , inflation gives a dynamical reason to such a peculiar initial condition .",
    "an expanding universe has _",
    "particle horizons _ , that is , spatial regions beyond which causal communication can not occur .",
    "the horizon distance can be defined as the maximum distance that light could have travelled since the origin of the universe  @xcite , @xmath200 which is proportional to the hubble scale .",
    "for instance , at the beginning of nucleosynthesis the horizon distance is a few light - seconds , but grows _ linearly _ with time and by the end of nucleosynthesis it is a few light - minutes , i.e. a factor 100 larger , while the scale factor has increased _ only _ a factor of 10 .",
    "the fact that the causal horizon increases faster , @xmath201 , than the scale factor , @xmath202 , implies that at any given time the universe contains regions within itself that , according to the big bang theory , were _ never _ in causal contact before .",

    "so why should regions that are separated by more than @xmath165 in the sky today have exactly the same temperature , to within 10 ppm , when the photons that come from those two distant regions could not have been in causal contact when they were emitted ?",

    "in modern physics , elementary particles are represented by quantum fields , which resemble the familiar electric , magnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "a field is simply a function of space and time whose quantum oscillations are interpreted as particles . in our case ,",
    "the inflaton field has , associated with it , a large potential energy density , which drives the exponential expansion during inflation , see fig .",

    "it is these minute differences that will allow cosmologists to differentiate between alternative models of inflation and discard those that do not agree with observations .",

    "which will see the light in the next few years , see ref .  @xcite .    as we have emphasized before , the fact that these anisotropies have such a small amplitude allow for an accurate calculation of the predicted anisotropies in linear perturbation theory .",
    "a particular cosmological model is characterized by a dozen or so parameters : the rate of expansion , the spatial curvature , the baryon content , the cold dark matter and neutrino contribution , the cosmological constant ( vacuum energy ) , the reionization parameter ( optical depth to the last scattering surface ) , and various primordial spectrum parameters like the amplitude and tilt of the adiabatic and isocurvature spectra , the amount of gravitational waves , non - gaussian effects , etc .",
    "all these parameters can now be fed into very fast cmb codes called cmbfast  @xcite and camb  @xcite , that compute the predicted temperature and polarization anisotropies to better than 1% accuracy , and thus can be used to compare with observations .",
    "these two satellites will improve both the sensitivity , down to @xmath345k , and the resolution , down to arc minutes , with respect to the previous cobe satellite , thanks to large numbers of microwave horns of various sizes , positioned at specific angles , and also thanks to recent advances in detector technology , with high electron mobility transistor amplifiers ( hemts ) for frequencies below 100 ghz and bolometers for higher frequencies .",
    "the primary advantage of hemts is their ease of use and speed , with a typical sensitivity of 0.5 mks@xmath403 , while the advantage of bolometers is their tremendous sensitivity , better than 0.1 mks@xmath403 , see ref .",
    "this will allow cosmologists to extract information from around 3000 multipoles !",
    "since most of the cosmological parameters have specific signatures in the height and position of the first few acoustic peaks , the higher the resolution , the more peaks one is expected to see , and thus the better the accuracy with which one will be able to measure those parameters , see table  2 .    although the satellite probes were designed for the accurate measurement of the cmb temperature anisotropies , there are other experiments , like balloon - borne and ground interferometers  @xcite .",
    "probably the most important objective of the future satellites ( beyond wmap ) will be the measurement of the cmb polarization anisotropies , discovered by dasi in november 2002  @xcite , and confirmed a few months later by wmap with greater accuracy  @xcite , see fig .  24 .",
    "these anisotropies were predicted by models of structure formation and indeed found at the level of microkelvin sensitivities , where the new satellites were aiming at . the complementary information contained in the polarization anisotropies already provides much more stringent constraints on the cosmological parameters than from the temperature anisotropies alone .",
    "however , in the future , planck and cmb pol will have much better sensitivities .",
    "in particular , the curl - curl component of the polarization power spectra is nowadays the only means we have to determine the tensor ( gravitational wave ) contribution to the metric perturbations responsible for temperature anisotropies , see fig .",

    "this simple connection allows for more stringent tests on the inflationary paradigm for the generation of metric perturbations , since it relates the large scales ( of order the present horizon ) with the smallest scales ( on galaxy scales ) .",

    "well after matter domination ( @xmath409 mpc ) , the metric perturbation has not changed significantly , so that @xmath410",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ deltarc ] ) determines the final density contrast in terms of the initial one . on smaller scales , there is a linear transfer function @xmath411 , which may be defined as  @xcite @xmath412 to calculate the transfer function one has to specify the initial condition with the relative abundance of photons , neutrinos , baryons and cold dark matter long before horizon crossing .",
    "the most natural condition is that the abundances of all particle species are uniform on comoving hypersurfaces ( with constant total energy density ) .",
    "this is called the _ adiabatic _ condition , because entropy is conserved independently for each particle species @xmath413 , i.e. @xmath414 , given a perturbation in time from a comoving hypersurface , so @xmath415 where we have used the energy conservation equation for each species , @xmath416 , valid to first order in perturbations .",
    "it follows that each species of radiation has a common density contrast @xmath417 , and each species of matter has also a common density contrast @xmath418 , with the relation  @xmath419 .",
    "given the adiabatic condition , the transfer function is determined by the physical processes occuring between horizon entry and matter domination . if the radiation behaves like a perfect fluid , its density perturbation oscillates during this era , with decreasing amplitude .",
    "the matter density contrast living in this background does not grow appreciably before matter domination because it has negligible self - gravity .",
    "the transfer function is therefore given roughly by , see eq .",
    "( [ powerspectrum ] ) , @xmath420 ( k / k_{\\rm eq})^2\\ , , & \\hspace{1cm}k\\gg k_{\\rm eq}\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    the perfect fluid description of the radiation is far from being correct after horizon entry , because roughly half of the radiation consists of neutrinos whose perturbation rapidly disappears through free streeming .",
    "the photons are also not a perfect fluid because they diffuse significantly , for scales below the silk scale , @xmath421 mpc .",
    "one might then consider the opposite assumption , that the radiation has zero perturbation after horizon entry .",
    "then the matter density perturbation evolves according to @xmath422 which corresponds to the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the zero - frequency oscillator defines the jeans wavenumber , @xmath423 . for @xmath424",
    ", @xmath425 grows exponentially on the dynamical timescale , @xmath426 , which is the time scale for gravitational collapse .",
    "one can also define the jeans length , @xmath427 which separates gravitationally stable from unstable modes . if we define the pressure response timescale as the size of the perturbation over the sound speed , @xmath428 , then , if @xmath429 , gravitational collapse of a perturbation can occur before pressure forces can response to restore hydrostatic equilibrium ( this occurs for @xmath430 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath431 , radiation pressure prevents gravitational collapse and there are damped acoustic oscillations ( for @xmath432 ) .",
    "we will consider now the behaviour of modes within the horizon during the transition from the radiation ( @xmath433 ) to the matter era ( @xmath434 ) .",
    "the growing mode solution increases only by a factor of 2 between horizon entry and the epoch when matter starts to dominate , i.e. @xmath435 . the transfer function is therefore again roughly given by eq .",
    "( [ tk ] ) . since the radiation consists roughly half of neutrinos , which free streem , and half of photons , which either form a perfect fluid or just diffuse , neither the perfect fluid nor the free - streeming approximation looks very sensible .",
    "a more precise calculation is needed , including : neutrino free streeming around the epoch of horizon entry ; the diffusion of photons around the same time , for scales below silk scale ; the diffusion of baryons along with the photons , and the establishment after matter domination of a common matter density contrast , as the baryons fall into the potential wells of cold dark matter .",
    "all these effects apply separately , to first order in the perturbations , to each fourier component , so that a linear transfer function is produced .",
    "there are several parametrizations in the literature , but the one which is more widely used is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath436^{-1/\\nu}\\ , , \\hspace{1 cm } \\nu=1.13\\,,\\\\[2 mm ] & & a=6.4\\,(\\omega_{\\rm m}h)^{-1}\\,h^{-1 } \\ { \\rm mpc}\\ , , \\\\ & & b=3.0\\,(\\omega_{\\rm m}h)^{-1}\\,h^{-1 } \\ { \\rm mpc}\\ , , \\\\ & & c=1.7\\,(\\omega_{\\rm m}h)^{-1}\\,h^{-1 } \\ { \\rm mpc}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we see that the behaviour estimated in eq .",
    "( [ tk ] ) is roughly correct , although the break at @xmath437 is not at all sharp , see fig .",
    "[ fig40 ] . the transfer function , which encodes the soltion to linear equations , ceases to be valid when the density contrast becomes of order 1 .",
    "after that , the highly nonlinear phenomenon of gravitational collapse takes place , see fig .",
    "[ fig40 ] .     as a function of wavenumber @xmath377 , in logarithmic scale , normalized to the local abundance of galaxy clusters , for an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath438 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curve shows the linear ( non - linear ) power spectrum .",
    "while the linear power spectrum falls off like @xmath439 , the non - linear power - spectrum illustrates the increased power on small scales due to non - linear effects , at the expense of the large - scale structures . from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=340 ]      our view of the large - scale distribution of luminous objects in the universe has changed dramatically during the last 25 years : from the simple pre-1975 picture of a distribution of field and cluster galaxies , to the discovery of the first single superstructures and voids , to the most recent results showing an almost regular web - like network of interconnected clusters , filaments and walls , separating huge nearly empty volumes .",
    "the increased efficiency of redshift surveys , made possible by the development of spectrographs and  specially in the last decade  by an enormous increase in multiplexing gain ( i.e. the ability to collect spectra of several galaxies at once , thanks to fibre - optic spectrographs ) , has allowed us not only to do _",
    "cartography _ of the nearby universe , but also to statistically characterize some of its properties , see ref .",
    "@xcite . at the same time , advances in theoretical modeling of the development of structure , with large high - resolution gravitational simulations coupled to a deeper yet limited understanding of how to form galaxies within the dark matter halos , have provided a more realistic connection of the models to the observable quantities  @xcite . despite the large uncertainties that still exist ,",
    "this has transformed the study of cosmology and large - scale structure into a truly quantitative science , where theory and observations can progress side by side .",
    "i will concentrate on two of the new catalogs , which are taking data at the moment and which have changed the field , the 2-degree - field ( 2df ) catalog and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the advantages of multi - object fibre spectroscopy have been pushed to the extreme with the construction of the 2df spectrograph for the prime focus of the anglo - australian telescope  @xcite .",
    "this instrument is able to accommodate 400 automatically positioned fibres over a 2 degree in diameter field .",
    "this implies a density of fibres on the sky of approximately 130 deg@xmath440 , and an optimal match to the galaxy counts for a magnitude @xmath441 , similar to that of previous surveys like the esp , with the difference that with such an area yield , the same number of redshifts as in the esp survey can be collected in about 10 exposures , or slightly more than one night of telescope time with typical 1 hour exposures .",
    "this is the basis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "its goal is to measure redshifts for more than 250,000 galaxies with @xmath442 .",
    "in addition , a faint redshift survey of 10,000 galaxies brighter than @xmath443 will be done over selected fields within the two main strips of the south and north galactic caps .",
    "the survey has now finished , with a quarter of a million redshifts .",
    "the final result can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most ambitious and comprehensive galaxy survey currently in progress is without any doubt the sloan digital sky survey  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the project is , first of all , to observe photometrically the whole northern galactic cap , 30@xmath444 away from the galactic plane ( about @xmath445 deg@xmath446 ) in five bands , at limiting magnitudes from 20.8 to 23.3 .",
    "the expectation is to detect around 50 million galaxies and around @xmath447 star - like sources .",
    "this has already led to the discovery of several high - redshift ( @xmath448 ) quasars , including the highest - redshift quasar known , at @xmath449 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . using two fibre spectrographs carrying 320 fibres each",
    ", the spectroscopic part of the survey will then collect spectra from about @xmath450 galaxies with @xmath451 and @xmath207 agns with @xmath452 .",
    "it will also select a sample of about @xmath207 red luminous galaxies with @xmath453 , which will be observed spectroscopically , providing a nearly volume - limited sample of early - type galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath454 , that will be extremely valuable to study the evolution of clustering .",
    "the data that is coming from these catalogs is so outstanding that already cosmologists are using them for the determination of the cosmological parameters of the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the main outcome of these catalogs is the linear power spectrum of matter fluctuations that give rise to galaxies , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "it covers from the large scales of order gigaparsecs , the realm of the unvirialised superclusters , to the small scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs , where the lyman-@xmath455 systems can help reconstruct the linear power spectrum , since they are less sensitive to the nonlinear growth of perturbations .",
    "as often happens in particle physics , not always are observations from a single experiment sufficient to isolate and determine the precise value of the parameters of the standard model .",
    "we mentioned in the previous section that some of the cosmological parameters created similar effects in the temperature anisotropies of the microwave background .",
    "we say that these parameters are _ degenerate _ with respect to the observations",
    ". however , often one finds combinations of various experiments / observations which break the degeneracy , for example by depending on a different combination of parameters .",
    "this is precisely the case with the cosmological parameters , as measured by a combination of large - scale structure observations , microwave background anisotropies , supernovae ia observations and hubble space telescope measurements .",
    "it is expected that in the near future we will be able to determine the parameters of the standard cosmological model with great precision from a combination of several different experiments .",
    "in the last five years we have seen a true revolution in the quality and quantity of cosmological data that has allowed cosmologists to determine most of the cosmological parameters with a few percent accuracy and thus fix a standard model of cosmology .",
    "the art of measuring the cosmos has developed so rapidly and efficiently that one may be temped of renaming this science as cosmonomy , leaving the word cosmology for the theories of the early universe . in summary , we now know that the stuff we are made of @xmath160 baryons @xmath160 constitutes just about 4% of all the matter / energy in the universe , while 25% is dark matter @xmath160 perhaps a new particle species related to theories beyond the standard model of particle physics @xmath160 , and the largest fraction , 70% , some form of diffuse tension also known as dark energy @xmath160 perhaps a cosmological constant .",
    "the rest , about 1% , could be in the form of massive neutrinos .    nowadays ,",
    "a host of observations @xmath160 from cmb anisotropies and large scale structure to the age and the acceleration of the universe @xmath160 all converge towards these values , see fig .",
    "fortunately , we will have , within this decade , new satellite experiments like planck , cmbpol , snap as well as deep galaxy catalogs from earth , to complement and precisely pin down the values of the standard model cosmological parameters below the percent level , see table  1 .",
    "all these observations would not make much sense without the encompassing picture of the inflationary paradigm that determines the homogeneous and isotropic background on top of which it imprints an approximately scale invariant gaussian spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations . at present",
    "all observations are consistent with the predictions of inflation and hopefully in the near future we may have information , from the polarization anisotropies of the microwave background , about the scale of inflation , and thus about the physics responsible for the early universe dynamics .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the cern - jinr european school of high energy physics 2004 , and very specially matteo cavalli - sforza , without whom this wonderful school would not have been the success it was .",
