    "recently , a proposal for the solution of the century old problem of the self - interaction of a charged particle was presented.@xcite one of the puzzles of this problem@xcite is that the momentum of the electromagnetic field of a particle with electrostatic energy @xmath0 moving with velocity @xmath1 is not @xmath2 as required by relativity , but is @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the discrepancy is due to the neglect of the inertia of the stress that is present in the particle to balance the electrostatic repulsion . unlike the inertia of energy , which is well known , many physicists are not aware of the inertia of pressure ( stress ) . in many cases",
    "such an effect is negligible , but for the case of the stress produced by electrostatic interactions , it is comparable to the inertial effects of the electromagnetic fields . if the inertia of stress is neglected , the calculations are inconsistent . in this paper",
    "we give an example in which these considerations are explicitly shown .",
    "we consider a solid disc of insulating material with radius @xmath4 and thickness @xmath5 such that @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ chargeddisc ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the material has a unit relative dielectric constant , @xmath7 .",
    "both faces of the disc are uniformly charged with opposite charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the axis of the disc is parallel to the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the lower face is positively charged .",
    "the surface charge density of the lower face is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "if we neglect border effects , the electric field is @xmath13 at any point inside the material and zero outside .",
    "the electrostatic energy is @xmath14    = 3.3 in    the electrostatic interactions produce stresses in the solid disc .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath15 is defined so that the total force that the surroundings produce on a body is the opposite of the integral of the stress tensor over the surface of the body.@xcite that is , @xmath16    = 3.3 in    the opposite charges in the faces attract each other , compressing the body ( see fig .",
    "[ forces ] ) .",
    "a positive stress develops for surfaces parallel to the faces .",
    "in contrast , the repulsion between charged elements of the same face produces a radial stretching of the body .",
    "hence , for surfaces parallel to the @xmath10 axis there is a negative stress that balances the repulsion .",
    "that is , the stress tensor is diagonal ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equal and negative and @xmath19 is positive ( see fig .  [ stresses ] ) .",
    "= 3.3 in    the standard way of calculating the stress is to use maxwell s tensor , but to keep the exposition as elementary as possible we will determine the stress using energy considerations . if the thickness @xmath5 is increased , the stress in the @xmath10-direction does a work that is the opposite to the work of the compressing force that it balances .",
    "@xmath20 then @xmath21    if the radius is increased , the work done by the stress is equal to the increase in the electrostatic energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 if we define @xmath24 , the stress tensor is @xmath25    let @xmath26 be the rest mass of the disc if it were not charged and @xmath0 be the electrostatic energy .",
    "then the equivalence between mass and energy predicts that if the disc moves with velocity @xmath1 , its energy is @xmath27 and its momentum is @xmath28 , where @xmath29^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the contributions of the electromagnetic fields to the energy and momentum are obtained by integrating the energy density @xmath30 and the poynting vector @xmath31 over the volume : @xmath32 and @xmath33    we will now evaluate the electromagnetic contributions for the disc moving in two different directions .",
    "consider the disc moving with velocity @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ zmotion ] ) .",
    "quantities for the moving body are denoted by a prime .",
    "the circular faces remain the same , @xmath35 , so the charge density is the same @xmath36 , but the thickness is reduced by the lorentz contraction @xmath37 .",
    "the electric field is also the same @xmath38 . inside the disc @xmath39 , so there is no magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally @xmath43",
    "we see that there is no contribution to the momentum even though we might have expected @xmath44 and that the energy decreases as @xmath45 instead of increasing as @xmath46 . considering only the electromagnetic fields",
    "does not give the correct result .",
    "now consider the disc moving with velocity @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ xmotion ] ) .",
    "the thickness is the same @xmath48 , but the faces become elliptical because of lorentz contraction in the @xmath49-direction . the area is reduced @xmath50 .",
    "the charge density is increased @xmath51 and so is the electric field @xmath52 .",
    "there is also a magnetic field inside the disc produced by the two sheets of opposite currents .",
    "the field can be calculated using ampre s law @xmath53    the poynting vector is @xmath54 and the electromagnetic momentum is @xmath55    the electromagnetic energy is    @xmath56ah\\gamma^{-1 } \\\\ & = u_e\\gamma\\big[1+\\big(\\frac{v}{c}\\big)^2\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this case the result is also not as might be expected .",
    "the energy has an extra @xmath57 term and the momentum is twice the expected value .",
    "the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field do not form a four - vector , and the effective mass is anisotropic .",
    "something is missing and that is the inertia of stress .",
    "we will use the following relativistic conventions , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "greek indices take the values 03 , and latin indices take the values 13 .",
    "the unit vectors in the direction of the spatial axes are @xmath62 .",
    "repeated indices indicate an implicit sum . the four - velocity @xmath63 is related to the velocity @xmath64 by , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the relativistic dynamics of a continuous medium is ruled by the energy and momentum conservation equation@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the force density four - vector , @xmath69 is the energy , and momentum density four - tensor , and @xmath70 is the stress four - tensor .",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are symmetric tensors .",
    "the spatial components of @xmath68 form the force density , @xmath71 .",
    "the temporal component is proportional to the power density , @xmath72 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the four - velocity by @xmath73 the four - scalar @xmath74 is the density of the rest mass with respect to the proper volume ( the volume of an element at rest ) .",
    "the usual rest mass density is @xmath75 .",
    "the spatial part of @xmath69 is the momentum current density @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the energy density , @xmath78 .",
    "the other elements of @xmath69 with only one temporal index are the energy current density vector @xmath79 and the momentum density vector @xmath80 .",
    "the stress four - tensor @xmath70 reduces to the purely spatial stress tensor when the matter element is at rest . when the element is moving , there are temporal components that contribute to the energy density @xmath81 and to the momentum density @xmath82 .",
    "that is , the stress has inertial effects . because @xmath83 is purely temporal at rest , we have @xmath84 equation ( [ condition ] ) is valid in any reference frame and can be used to obtain the temporal components of the stress , which are    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the stress tensor in that frame .    by separating the spatial and temporal components , eq .",
    "( [ releq ] ) reduces to the momentum and power equations , @xmath87 and @xmath88    it is interesting to compare these equations with the non - relativistic ones , which are@xcite @xmath89 and @xmath90 here @xmath30 is the energy density of matter which includes the kinetic and internal energies .",
    "note that the only contributions of the stress which appear in the non - relativistic equations are those in the divergence terms .",
    "also note that the stress that multiplies the velocity in the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) does not vanish in the small velocity limit ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this case is an example in which the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath92 ) is different from the small velocity limit .",
    "that is , the inertia of stress is a purely relativistic phenomenon , which does not have a newtonian explanation .",
    "we now calculate the contributions of stress to the energy and momentum .",
    "the contributions are @xmath93    the easiest way to obtain the stress tensor for the moving disc is to use the lorentz transformation of the result for the rest frame , eq .",
    "( [ stresstensor ] ) : @xmath94 where for motion in the @xmath10-direction , the transformation matrix is @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and the four - tensor of stress is @xmath97 the energy of stress is @xmath98 the total energy is then    @xmath99\\gamma u_e=\\gamma u_e,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as expected .",
    "the momentum of stress is @xmath100 the total momentum is also the expected value , @xmath101 .",
    "now let us consider motion in the @xmath49-direction .",
    "the matrix of the lorentz transformation is @xmath102 and the stress is @xmath103 the energy of stress is @xmath104 the total energy is therefore @xmath105 -\\big(\\frac{v}{c}\\big)^2\\gamma u_e=\\gamma u_e,\\ ] ] which is the expected result .",
    "the momentum of stress is @xmath106 in this case the correct total momentum is @xmath107 everything works if we take into account the contributions of stress .",
    "the energy and momentum of an extended system are obtained by integrating the energy density and the momentum density over the entire volume .",
    "the spaces of two different reference frames are different three - dimensional hyperplanes in the four - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "so , in principle , the total energy and momentum of an extended system in different frames are not the same physical quantities .",
    "if energy and momentum are conserved , they form a four - vector . when the electromagnetic field is not free , that is , when there are charges and currents , the field itself is stressed .",
    "this stress contributes to the energy and momentum of the field , which is why these quantities do not form a four - vector .",
    "the electromagnetic forces produce stresses in matter .",
    "the stress of matter also contributes to the energy and momentum , and also do not form a four - vector .",
    "the contributions of the stress of matter are exactly opposite to those of the stress of the field .",
    "thus , if the contributions of the stress of matter are added to those of the field , the total energy and momentum transform as a four - vector .",
