    "ever since the earliest days of lattice field theory , one problem present in most numerical simulations has been the calculation of corrections induced by renormalization on monte carlo results .",
    "although this notorious problem has not as yet been adequately dealt with , several methods have been used to address it : to begin with , perturbation theory provides in principle a methodical means of calculating , order by order in the coupling , renormalization functions , operator mixing coefficients , etc .",
    "its drawbacks lie in its asymptotic nature , and in that it is a formidable task on the lattice , which places severe limitations on the order to which it can be carried out ; indeed , at present , exact calculations in perturbative lattice qcd reach only two loops ( for 2-point diagrams )  @xcite and three loops ( for vacuum diagrams )  @xcite . various nonperturbative , numerical approaches to renormalization functions",
    "have also been devised and there has been recent progress both in their range of applicability and in their precision  @xcite . finally , much effort has also gone in studying improved actions ( which may , among other advantages , show improved renormalization behaviour )  @xcite and improved / boosted perturbation theory  @xcite .    in this paper , we present an improvement of lattice perturbation theory , which results from a resummation to all orders of a certain class of diagrams , dubbed `` cactus '' diagrams",
    ". briefly stated , these are tadpole diagrams which become disconnected if any one of their vertices is removed ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "our original motivation was the well known observation of `` tadpole dominance '' in lattice perturbation theory ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this observation must clearly be taken with a grain of salt : one - sided inclusion of tadpoles can ruin desirable partial cancellations between tadpole and non - tadpole diagrams ; worse ,    0.02    1.0cm1.0 cm    their contribution is gauge dependent . the class of terms we propose to resum circumvents the latter objection since , as we shall see , it is gauge invariant ; it also overcomes the former objection in known cases .",
    "cactus resummation may be applied either to bare quantities or to quantities which have been calculated to a given order in perturbation theory ; thus contributions which are not included in the resummation can be reintroduced in a systematic manner .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we present our calculation , leading to expressions for a dressed propagator and dressed vertices of interest ; some derivations and technical details are relegated to the appendices . in section  [ sec3 ] , we proceed to use these expressions to calculate various renormalization functions , and compare our results with other methods : we find a remarkable improvement in many cases .",
    "consider the standard wilson action for @xmath0 lattice gauge fields : @xmath1 @xmath2 is the usual product of link variables around a plaquette in the @xmath3 plane with origin at @xmath4 ; in standard notation it reads : @xmath5 by the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula we have : @xmath6    the diagrams which we propose to resum to all orders will be cactus diagrams made of vertices containing @xmath7 .",
    "let us see how such diagrams will dress the gluon propagator ; we write : @xmath8 where the one - particle irreducible piece is given by the recursive equation : @xmath9 now , the fact that the vertices involved in the above contain only @xmath10 implies that the longitudinal parts of all propagators will always cancel . as we will see , this fact will lead to the result that the effect of dressing is the same in all covariant gauges .",
    "we will thus denote by a thick ( thin ) solid line the transverse dressed ( bare ) propagator .    from eq .",
    "( [ recursive ] ) there follows : @xmath11 indeed , the dressed propagator will become a multiple of the bare transverse one , where the factor @xmath12 will depend on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , but not on the momentum .",
