    "the most important non - perturbative approch to study @xmath0 is lattice gauge theory . however , there are some observables , where computational progress in lattice gauge theory has been slow .",
    "examples are : finite density thermodynamics ( quark - gluon plasma ) , exited states of the mass spectrum ( hadrons and mesons ) , dynamical scattering calculations of cross sections and hadron structure functions , in particular in the region of small @xmath1 and small @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "a non - perturbative hamiltonian approach may be a viable alternative .",
    "the hamiltonian method does have some advantages over the lagrangian method .",
    "it is relatively simple to obtain wavefunctions of the hadronic states , and it is likely that some physical information on the glueballs , e.g. , the wavefunction can be derived in this formulation more easily @xcite . in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ,",
    "the success of the parton model suggests the physical idea to use a fast moving frame also for a computational study of those processes .",
    "the parton model can be justified using the operator product expansion . in equal - time quantization ,",
    "the breit - frame is the most convenient choice of frame in order to interpret structure functions . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors have proposed such a scheme based on equal - time quantization , using a lattice hamiltonian on a momentum lattice corresponding to a fast moving frame ( breit - frame ) .",
    "it has been applied to the scalar @xmath4 theory in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "distribution functions and the mass spectrum in the close neighbourhood of the critical line of the second order phase transition have been computed .",
    "here we study a simple gauge theory , namely @xmath6 @xcite , the so - called massive schwinger model , in this framework @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show : ( a ) the use of a fast moving frame , such that @xmath7 , in conjunction with _ equal - time _",
    "quantization works well also in @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain quite precise results in the ultra - relativistic region @xmath8 .",
    "( b ) we consider as most important new results of this work the non - perturbative results of the dependence of the vector and scalar mass on the @xmath9-angle .",
    "starting from the lagrangian , we use the axial gauge @xmath10 to obtain the hamiltonian @xmath11 one introduces a space - time lattice given by spacing @xmath12 with @xmath13 lattice nodes . via discrete fourier transformation",
    "one goes over to a momentum lattice , with cut - off @xmath14 and resolution @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by the parton picture we make the assumption that left - moving particles are not dynamically important , if physical particles are considered from a reference frame    characterized by a velocity @xmath16 which is close to the velocity of light .",
    "we thus consider a momentum lattice where @xmath17 . in order to minimize the number of virtual particle pairs created from the vacuum , we choose a small lattice size .",
    "the reason for this is that the number of vacuum pairs is roughly proportional to a vacuum density times the lattice size . on the other hand , a fast - moving physical particle is lorentz contracted ; thus it fits into a small lattice volume ( when compared to the rest - frame ) . for the purpose of computing the mass spectrum ,",
    "we need to determine the vacuum energy . because the vacuum has the quantum number @xmath18 , the vacuum energy ( and only this ) is computed in the rest frame . because the model is super - renormalizable",
    ", one can perform the continuum limit @xmath19 .",
    "the only renormalization necessary is the subtraction of the vacuum energy . on a space - time lattice ,",
    "one has to satisfy a physical condition ( scaling window ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the correlation length in dimensionless units , related to the physical mass of the ground state by @xmath22 . in a strongly relativistic system ,",
    "@xmath23 , thus when @xmath19 the scaling window is replaced by @xmath24 . for more details",
    "compare with ref.@xcite .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian in a sector with momentum @xmath25 to obtain the vacuum energy @xmath26 .",
    "then we diagonalize the hamiltonian in a sector @xmath27 corresponding to a relativistic velocity .",
    "this yields an energy spectrum @xmath28 .",
    "the physical energies are obtained from @xmath29 .",
    "the mass spectrum is then given by @xmath30 .",
    "the low lying states of the massive schwinger model are a vector state and next a scalar state @xcite .",
    "the mass of the vector boson in the chiral region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massvector ] .",
    "the vector particle is almost entirely a fermion - antifermion ( @xmath31 ) bound state .",
    "we find good agreement with chiral perturbation theory @xcite and with finite lattice results by hamer et al.@xcite .",
    "the massive schwinger model has @xmath9-vacua and one can study its @xmath9-action .",
    "the wavefunction is invariant under local gauge transformations .",
    "the @xmath9-angle characterizes the behavior of the wavefunction under global gauge transformations @xmath32",
    "e^{i n \\theta } \\psi[a]$ ] , where @xmath33 . the mass spectrum of low - lying states as a function of the @xmath9-angle is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thetadependence ] .",
    "the results are in agreement with first oder chiral perturbation theory in the ultra - relativistic regime ( @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) .",
    "the feynman - hellmann theorem relates the fermion condensate @xmath38 to the derivative of the vacuum energy .",
    "similarly holds for the vector state @xmath39 extracting the slope @xmath40 from our data we obtain @xmath41 while the exact solution of the massless schwinger model gives a factor @xmath42 on the r.h.s .      in the hamiltonian approach it is easy to compute the wavefunction of a low - lying state .",
    "> from the wavefunction one can obtain information on its parton structure , i.e. , the number of partons and their momentum distribution .",

    "[ fig : distribfct ] we display lattice results of the distribution function for @xmath45 to @xmath46 . in the massless",
    "limit the distribution function has the shape of a box .",
    "our results are compared with variational calculations using the infinite - momentum frame by bergknoff @xcite and also with those by mo and perry @xcite using the light - cone .",
    "the most sensitive region is the ultra - relativistic region .",
    "we find agreement in shape with mo and perry s results and very good agreement with bergknoff s results .",
    "in this work we have applied a hamiltonian lattice approach in a fast moving reference frame to study the massive schwinger model .",
    "we find that the method works well for the computation of the low - lying mass spectrum and distribution functions .",
    "it works also in the presence of the @xmath9-action .",
    "here we have investigated only @xmath47 .",
    "more @xmath9-angles can be studied , e.g. by adding a small number of negative momentum states to the basis",
