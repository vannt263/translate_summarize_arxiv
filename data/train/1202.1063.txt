    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates , it has been a key interest to find the mechanism that causes the high @xmath5 and its unconventionality . after more than 20 years of intensive investigations , however , the origin of high-@xmath5 superconductivity in cuprates is still unsolved .",
    "the discovery of relatively high @xmath5 in iron - based superconductors @xcite opens a different route for high - temperature superconductivity and thus provides a unique opportunity to re - clarify the physics of the unconventional superconductivity .",
    "one of the features for the unconventional superconductivity is the appearance of the sign - switched gap function .",
    "the presence of disconnected fermi surface ( fs ) sheets in iron - based superconductors is an ingenious condition for the existence of the sign - switched order parameters such as @xmath6-wave and _",
    "d_-wave @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the superconducting ( sc ) pairing is driven by the inter - fs - sheet scattering or equivalently by the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fluctuations @xcite as the inter - fs - sheet scattering also leads to a strong afm correlation .    the recent discovery of alkaline - intercalated iron - selenide superconductor a@xmath7fe@xmath1se@xmath2 with @xmath5 above 30k @xcite initiates an interesting branch for exploring superconductivity in iron - based superconductors . the chemically - stable structure a@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 exhibits a @xmath10 iron - vacancy order and block - checkerboard antiferromagnetism @xcite . by varying contents of iron or alkaline ,",
    "the afm state becomes unstable and the sc state appears @xcite .",
    "more recently , it is indicated that the antiferromagnetic phase and the superconducting phase may be separated in different space regions@xcite .",
    "in particular , a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurement @xcite shows that the sample would be spontaneously separated into the superconducting kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 and the insulating k@xmath11fe@xmath9se@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , it still needs further clarification to see if the insulating region can be altered into a metal by chemical doping or by applying pressure .",
    "first - principles calculations indicate that by applying pressure to samples with the @xmath10 iron - vacancy order , the system goes through two successive magnetic transitions , from the semiconducting block - checkerboard afm phase to the metallic stripe ( collinear ) afm phase and then to a metallic non - magnetic phase @xcite .",
    "these results agree with transport measurements and indicate that a semiconductor - to - metal transition can be induced by the pressure@xcite .",
    "the issue of whether the iron - vacancy - ordered a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 supports superconductivity , however , remains unsettled as it is shown that as the system became more metallic under pressure , @xmath5 gets smaller , and whether it suggests the necessity of strong correlation for the emergence of superconductivity is an open question .    on the other hand , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments find singlet superconductivity and no pronounced spin fluctuations near @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/__t__@xmath12_t _ shows the absence of the hebel - slichter coherence peak and a power - law behavior below @xmath5 , indicating an unconventional sc gap which is very likely gapless .",
    "although salient spin fluctuations are not present in nmr , the possibility of spin - fluctuation - driven superconductivity should not be excluded since the information of spin fluctuations would be hidden in signals@xcite .",
    "a recent raman measurement on the two - magnon scattering shows that the scattering rate grows as the temperature approaches @xmath5 and undergoes a sudden drop when the system enters the sc phase @xcite .",
    "it thus supports that superconductivity arises from magnetic fluctuations .",
    "theoretically , previous works @xcite on superconductivity in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 were based on the band structure of kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the iron - vacancy order has been proved to induce a big change in the fs shape @xcite , though it is not confirmed so far by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , if superconductivity could happen in the iron - vacancy ordering phase , it is crucial to examine the pairing symmetry and pairing mechanism .    in this work",
    ", we investigate superconducting instability in iron - vacancy - ordered a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "previously , based on the 12-orbital tight - binding model that fits the band structure of k@xmath0fe@xmath13se@xmath2 , we have studied the magnetic phase in the generalized hubbard model and succeeded in explaining the block - checkerboard afm instability from the stoner s theory @xcite .",
    "here based on the same tight - binding model and starting from a non - magnetic metallic phase , we examine the superconductivity by the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approach @xcite . for singlet superconductivity , we examine the pairing coupling constants for _ s_-wave and _ d_-wave states from the effective scattering matrix .",
    "we find that similar to other iron - pnictide superconductors @xcite , _ s_-wave and _ d_-wave are closely degenerate .",
    "furthermore , the gap functions in both symmetries are highly anisotropic and have nodes . in addition , since the iron - vacancy order lowers the symmetry of a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 to the group @xmath3 , the gap functions do not need to be reflection symmetric and this implies that there are degrees of freedom in defining origins of angles for the pairing momenta .",
    "these extra degrees of freedom for the gap functions can further increase the gain of the condensation energy .",
    "in addition , we find that the pairing symmetry is controllable by tuning the hund s rule coupling @xmath4 and the critical value at about @xmath14 .",
    "the hund s rule coupling manipulates the phase transition or crossover in superconductivity , antiferromagnetism @xcite , or even the metallic transport @xcite , reflecting the substantial role played by the orbital - correlation in the multi - orbital electronic systems .",
    "the vacancy ordered iron selenide a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is a system with one - fifth of fe being taken off and forming a characteristic @xmath15 pattern ( fig .",
    "[ lattice](a ) ) .",

    "the absence of reflection symmetry implies that there is no symmetry axis .",

    "similar to the _ s_-wave case , although nodes appear on every fs sheet , they are shifted away from the diagonal directions .",
    "the main cause for the occurrence of _ d_-wave differs from that for the _ s_-wave and is primarily due to reduction of repulsion in intra - pocket and inter - electron - pocket scatterings through its sign - changing character . as a result ,",

    "d_-wave states are found to be close in energy . in particular , a quantum critical point is found at @xmath188 , below which the _ d_-wave prevails , while above which the _ s _ -wave wins over .",
    "furthermore , unlike the iron - pnictide superconductors , the iron - vacancy order lowers the symmetry to the group @xmath3 so that the gap functions do not need to be reflection symmetric .",

    "this implies that the complete order parameters for characterizing the superconductivity in a@xmath0fe@xmath9se@xmath2 consist of both the magnitude of the gap and the orientation of the pairing wave function relative to the underlying lattice .    finally , while our work focuses on the superconductivity , the finding of quantum critical point controlled by @xmath4 in superconductivity is not an accident . in the magnetism",
