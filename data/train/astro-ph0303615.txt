    "a very attractive way out remains to be the conclusion that early - type galaxies are indeed underabundant in the element calcium .",
    "the main problem is that this interpretation remains speculative as long as the sensitivity of the cat index to calcium abundance is not known , and in particular calcium underabundant stellar population models of cat are not available .",
    "interestingly , also the blue lick index ca4227 at @xmath6    is very weak in early - type galaxies , which again indicates a possible calcium underabundance @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn on the basis of ca4455 index measurements @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that ca4455 , despite its name , appears to be only sensitive to the abundances of iron - peak elements @xcite , so that the weak ca4455 absorption reflects the well - known iron underabundance in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note that calcium itself is an @xmath0-element .",
    "having the issue of weak calcium absorption in early - type galaxies in mind , we developed additional models in which calcium is detached from the group of @xmath0-elements , allowing for variations of the @xmath1  element ratio .",

    "the admittedly large scatter of the relation between @xmath1  and @xmath26 is fully consistent with the errors in [ @xmath1 ] ( @xmath29  dex ) , which are caused mainly by the large observational errors of ca4227 .",

    "we will briefly discuss possible mechanisms that can lead to the formation of calcium underabundant stellar populations .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "note that high @xmath15  ratio are actually an iron underabundance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are a good measure for star formation timescales , because a substantial fraction of iron comes from the delayed enrichment by type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "note that also the old , metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way , which formed at an early stage of the galaxy s evolution , are underabundant in iron ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it may seem therefore straightforward to link also the underabundance of calcium with formation timescales .",
    "the situation for the @xmath1  ratio , however , is entirely different .",
    "the old , metal - poor halo stars are not underabundant in calcium @xcite , hence the solar @xmath1  ratio is already at place in the very beginning of chemical enrichment . in other words , calcium , which is actually an @xmath0-element , is enriched in lockstep with the other @xmath0-elements . moreover ,",
    "type ia supernovae produce mainly iron and do not contribute significantly to the enrichment of calcium @xcite .",
    "the calcium underabundance found in early - type galaxies can therefore not be explained through the link of formation timescales with delayed type ia supernova enrichment .    within type  ii supernova nucleosynthesis",
    ", calcium comes mainly from supernovae of the less massive progenitors with @xmath33  @xmath34@xcite .",
    "if the chemical enrichment is dominated by stars more massive than @xmath35 , calcium underabundance can be achieved @xcite .",
    "because of the short lifetimes of these stars , however , extremely short formation timescales ( @xmath36  yr ) would be required , implying unreasonably high star formation rates up to @xmath37  @xmath34  per year .",
    "alternatively , also a flattening of the initial mass function ( imf ) enhances the contribution from high - mass stars to the chemical enrichment . integrating the supernova yields of @xcite with variable imf slopes , we find that an abundance ratio @xmath12\\sim 0.2 $ ] requires extremely shallow imf slopes of the order @xmath38 ( salpeter being @xmath39 ) . a flattening of the initial mass function to produce calcium underabundance",
    "can therefore be ruled out , as such shallow imfs violate other observational constraints , in particular predict stellar mass - to - light ratios @xcite well above the dynamical determinations @xcite .",
    "a more appealing solution may be connected to a metallicity dependence of supernova yields , in the sense that in metal - rich supernovae the production ( or at least the ejection ) of calcium is depressed @xcite .    from the theoretical side of type  ii supernova modelling",
    ", there are no clear indications for the existence of metallicity - dependent yields . the calculations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model b ) predict only a very mild increase of the @xmath1  ratio with increasing metallicity in the supernova ejecta for the metallicity range 1/10,000 to solar . extrapolating these yields to double - solar metallicity leads to [ @xmath1 ] ratios , which are @xmath30 dex below the values derived here for massive early - type galaxies .",
    "if metallicity effects are at work , they must set in at super - solar metallicities , a range which has not yet been explored in type  ii supernova nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "this option gets support from the fact that only the stars with metallicities above solar in the @xcite data are calcium underabundant",
    ". it would also be very well consistent with the @xmath1-@xmath5 correlation of early - type galaxies found in this paper .",
    "the most significant increase of the @xmath1  ratio with galaxy mass occurs among giant galaxies in a regime of super - solar metallicity .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath1  ratio when going to the local group dwarf spheroidals by at most 0.1  dex is relatively small , instead , given the huge drop in metallicity to about 1.5  dex below solar .",
    "to conclude , the possibility of metallicity dependent yields at super - solar metallicities remains a promising track to follow in order to find the origin of the calcium underabundance in early - type galaxies .",
