    "recent work on integrable quantum fields in 1 + 1 dimensions has introduced a class of theories where the domain of the field is bounded .",
    "the boundaries restrict the field either to the half line or an interval and impose fixed boundary conditions upon it ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the present work we introduce a new class of integrable theories where the field is coupled to a classical or quantum mechanical system at the boundary of its domain . effectively we are allowing new degrees of freedom to exist on the boundary and so the field has dynamic boundary conditions .    in section two",
    "we describe one example of such a system , where the sine - gordon field is restricted to the half line bounded by a non - linear oscillator . then by extension of the coupling constant into imaginary values we briefly consider the equivalent system for the sinh - gordon field .",
    "section three contains the derivation of our example system , including details on how sklyanin s technique has applied to a system with dynamic boundary k matrices .",
    "section four comprises a discussion on this class of theory .",
    "much of the content of this paper follows the work of baseilhac and delius @xcite . due to restrictions on space",
    "we have omitted from the present work the discussion on dynamic solutions to the quantum reflection equation that appeared in @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe an integrable systems consisting of a sine - gordon field restricted to the half line and coupled to an oscillator at the boundary .",
    "the sine - gordon model is a 1 + 1 dimensional theory describing a relativistic , self - interacting , massive , bosonic field .",
    "we introduce a boundary at the origin by restricting the field to the half line between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a field is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sine - gordon field and @xmath4 is the conjugate momentum , with the usual poisson brackets @xmath5 .",
    "both @xmath6 , the sine - gordon coupling constant , and @xmath7 , the mass scale parameter , are real .",
    "we now couple the field at the boundary to a classical system with the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the field at @xmath1 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to the position , @xmath12 , and momentum , @xmath13 , variables of the oscillator as @xmath14 where @xmath15 sets the mass of the oscillator .",
    "this becomes obvious after expansion of for small @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "position and momentum variables have the usual poisson bracket @xmath16 and our rescaled variables have the relation @xmath17 .    the total hamiltonian of the system can be expressed as the sum of the oscillator and bulk field hamiltonians @xmath18    we are now in a position to find hamilton s equations for the bulk field , they are @xmath19 the two terms proportional to @xmath20 in come from two different sources .",
    "the @xmath21 term comes from the boundary contribution due to the partial integration of the sine - gordon field .",
    "the other terms are due to the boundary oscillator containing @xmath9 .",
    "we require , for a physical solution , that @xmath22 is continuous , i.e. the @xmath20 term must be zero .",
    "this gives us the boundary condition @xmath23    by substituting into and applying the boundary condition we recover the usual sine - gordon equation of motion @xmath24    we can find hamilton s equations for the boundary oscillator in a similar way @xmath25 @xmath26 by combining these two equations we are able to find the equation of motion of the oscillator @xmath27 where dots denote derivatives with respect to time and the function @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 we note that the oscillator s hamiltonian , and thus the boundary condition for the field , are complex .",
    "this generally leads to complex solutions , both in the bulk and for boundary states .",
    "this is not without precedent , for example soliton solutions in affine toda theories are complex , however it has been shown that the energies of these solutions are nevertheless real @xcite .",
    "we hope that the energies of solutions to our system will also be real .",
    "we note that our boundary condition is similar in form to the previously known integrable boundary conditions @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 are parameters . in the classical case",
    "our boundary condition reduces to equation with @xmath32 when @xmath33 .",
    "this will never occur in the quantum case as the position and momentum of the system can never be simultaneously known .",
    "we also note that by requiring the coupling constant to be purely imaginary , @xmath34 , we can obtain the equations for the equivalent integrable system for the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "for instance the hamiltonian becomes @xmath35 we note that the hamiltonian is real , which leads to real solutions .",
    "in this section we describe sklyanin s formalism @xcite and how we have applied this technique to dynamic boundary conditions .",
    "we illustrate our method with the derivation of the example system presented in section two .",
    "equation is the compatability condition for the overdetermined set of equations @xmath44 the transition matrix @xmath45 is defined as the solution to with initial condition @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 can be expressed as a path ordered exponential @xmath48 such that the operators are ordered with those at points nearest @xmath49 furthest to the left .",
    "this gives the matrix the inversion property @xmath50    the poisson brackets for the matrices @xmath51 can be written in the form @xmath52 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to poisson brackets for the transition matrix @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this gives us the r - matrix , which is independent of both the field and its conjugate momentum .",
    "for the derivation of the sine - gordon example we redefine the poisson brackets such that the range of the integral extends only over the space occupied by the field .",
    "so at fixed time the poisson brackets for any observable @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 by calculating these poisson brackets for @xmath58 we can find the r - matrix for the sine - gordon system , @xmath59    we now introduce two matrix valued functions of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , which are independent of the field and describe the nature of the boundaries at @xmath62 .",
    "it is at this point that we deviate from previous applications of sklyanin s method .",
    "we wish to describe a dynamic boundary so require that its @xmath63 matrix be dependent upon the position and momentum variables of the boundary system .",
    "we further require that the @xmath63 matrices satisfy the classical reflection equation @xmath64 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber + & \\stackrel{1}{k}_{\\pm } ( \\theta ) r ( \\theta + \\theta ' ) \\stackrel{2}{k}_{\\pm } ( \\theta ' ) - \\stackrel{2}{k}_{\\pm } ( \\theta ' )",
    "r ( \\theta + \\theta ' ) \\stackrel{1}{k}_{\\pm } ( \\theta ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we want the two boundaries to be independent of each other , we also require that the relation @xmath65 be satisfied .",
    "as we are deriving a system on the half line we choose to place @xmath66 at @xmath67 and have @xmath68 take the trivial solution to the classical reflection equation , @xmath69 .",
    "we impose @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "we note the independence condition is automatically satisfied due to our choice of @xmath68 .",
    "we will take @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "this is a solution to with @xmath74 defined in .",
    "we will position this boundary at the origin , @xmath75 .",
    "following sklyanin s technique we now define the generating function to be @xmath76 these generating functions are in involution , i.e. @xmath77 , and can be expanded around any singularities in @xmath78 .",
    "such an expansion will produce an infinite number of conserved quantities @xmath79 , that are also in involution with each other .",
    "one of these quantities will be identifiable as the hamiltonian of the system , implying that all @xmath79 are time conserved .    applying the inversion relation and the fact that we chose @xmath80 to gives us an expression for the generating function for the sine - gordon example @xmath81 we note from that the matrix @xmath82 has singularities at @xmath83 .",
    "thus the transition matrix @xmath47 also has two singularities .",
    "performing a laurent expansion on @xmath84 around either of these points gives a laurent series , the coefficients of which give us an infinite number of conserved quantities @xmath79 @xcite , @xmath85 the first non - trivial quantity is @xmath86 where @xmath87 which , under the canonical transformation @xmath88 reproduces the hamiltonian of our example sine - gordon system presented in section two ( equations and ) . @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath10 are defined in equation .",
    "the next non - trivial quantity after the hamiltonian gives the spin 3 charge , applying the same canonical transformation , @xmath89 in principle , similar expressions can be obtained for any of the infinite number of conserved charges of our system .",
    "the existence of these higher order local integrals of motion shows that our system is classically integrable .",
    "in this paper we have described in detail one example of an integrable field theory coupled to a dynamic boundary system ; this being the sine - gordon field , restricted to the half line , and coupled to a non - linear oscillator at the boundary .",
