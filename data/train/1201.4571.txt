    "blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) are helium core - burning stars , typically about 0.7m@xmath5 and 3r@xmath5 , which exist at a near - constant absolute g band magnitude of about 0.7 @xcite .",
    "since they are such luminous objects with a predictable brightness , they are frequently used as standard candles to explore distant galactic structure and are widely sought tracers for structural and kinematic studies of the milky way ( e.g. clewley & jarvis 2006 , ruhland 2011 , wilhelm et al .",
    "1999 , xue et al .",
    "owing to their old ages ( @xmath612 gyr in many globular clusters , dotter et al .",
    "2010 ) , bhb stars are particularly excellent halo tracers , since the halo is expected to be an old , metal - poor structure .",
    "other high luminosity stars , such as k and m giants , are less desirable as their absolute magnitudes cover a wide range of values and they may intrinsically be much younger objects .",
    "photometrically , bhbs reside in a specific color range , being just bluer in @xmath7 than the instability strip ( rr lyraes ) and just redder than extended vertical blue horizontal branch ( sub - dwarf ) stars . this `` blue '' color slice ( -0.3 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 ; all magnitudes and colors in this paper are extinction corrected and dereddened according to the values of schlegel et al .",
    "1998 unless otherwise stated ) contains three main contaminants to bhb selection : distant quasars , foreground white dwarfs , and main sequence a stars ( msa ; blue stragglers are photometrically very similar to msa stars and so they are included in the same category for the purposes of this paper ) .",
    "the most accurate way to separate a bhb star from these contaminants is via spectroscopy .",
    "spectral templates will immediately eliminate white dwarf and quasar contamination ( as white dwarfs have very broad absorption lines , and quasars have strong emission rather than absorption lines ) . to separate msa stars from bhbs ,",
    "two main approaches exist : first a comparison of balmer line depth ( @xmath9 ) and broadening ( @xmath10 ) caused by the different surface temperatures and surface gravities , respectively ( see pier 1983 ) , of the stars ; and secondly the scale - width - shape method described by @xcite which separates the two species based on the balmer line fits to a srsic profile .    in the absence of spectroscopic data however",
    ", photometric methods may be applied to separate bhb stars from other blue species .",
    "this has been shown to be quite effective in several studies .",
    "for example : @xcite demonstrated a filter cut in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) which separates bhb stars from msa stars adequately enough to discern significant structure in the plane of the celestial equator ; @xcite use a `` stringent '' cut similar to that proposed by @xcite on the basis of spectroscopic data and a combination of the scale - width - shape method and the @xmath10 and @xmath9 methods in their kinematic studies of the galactic halo ; more recently @xcite further refine this `` stringent '' cut in their investigation of the ratios of bhb to main sequence turn off stars in the halo .    for the sdss , @xcite ,",
    "using kurucz model spectra , suggest that optimal gravitational separation for blue a - type stars lies in the @xmath11 color space .",
    "this is largely due to the balmer jump , a spectral feature at 365 nm which is highly dependent on surface gravity .",
    "@xcite also suggest separation in @xmath12 space , but note that gravitational splitting in this color - space is less effective than in the @xmath11 color space .",
    "we show that splitting here is caused by the paschen features which reside in the z band and are also sensitive to surface gravity .",
    "this gravitational splitting in the @xmath0 band is a serendipitous development with regards to the ongoing panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; kaiser et al .",
    "2010 ) project , which features filters similar to the sdss photometric system ( @xmath13 , see fukugita et al .",
    "1996 , gunn et al .",
    "the main difference being that the sdss , originally designed as a primarily extragalactic survey , uses the @xmath4 band to efficiently separate out quasars ( e.g. richards et al 2009 and references therein ) while pan - starrs is primarily concerned with near earth objects and , as such , opts for a near infrared @xmath14 band instead of the u filter .",
    "it is worth noting that pan - starrs , a purely photometric survey , plans to survey three - fourths of the celestial sphere to 24@xmath15 magnitude in the optical @xcite while sdss , as of data release 8 ( dr8 ; aihara et al .",
    "2011 ) has imaged one - third of the sky to a limiting magnitude of 22.2 in g and r. so , by developing an efficient way to select bhb candidate stars in the absence of a u band , we may facilitate statistical structural studies in a larger area of sky , to fainter magnitudes , than is currently possible with sdss data .    with this in mind ,",
    "we create a color space cut to select out bhb stars from the primary contaminants based on surface gravity measurements , but rather than exploiting u band separation , we explore the usefulness of the z band . with an end - goal of structure mapping and halo studies in mind , we aim primarily for a high purity selection at the cost of completeness .",
    "we attempt to achieve accuracies similar to those quoted by @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath8 30% contamination ) , however , we also expect a lowered sample completeness because of the poorer gravitational separation in this color space . in ",
    "2 we describe the formulation of the color cut using sdss spectroscopic data . in ",
    "3 we estimate the completeness of the cut by examining a sample of 10 globular clusters located in the sdss footprint . in ",
    "4 we explore the usefulness of this method for probing galactic structure by examining photometric data of the celestial equator which is rife with features . in  5 we discuss the implications of this method .",
    "to investigate the separation of various blue objects in the @xmath12 color space suggested by @xcite , we select spectra from sdss dr8 .",
    "dr8 extends the sdss footprint to now cover a full third of the celestial sphere and increases the total number of spectra to over 1.8 million .",
    "we selected spectroscopic data from the entire sdss footprint , only clean ( not near saturated pixels ) objects evaluated as point sources were selected .",
    "we used only primary measurements ( in the case of multiply observed objects , the highest signal to noise reading is flagged as the primary one ) . to make our study consistent with those of @xcite and @xcite we select only stars with @xmath1 @xmath8 18 .    in figure 1 , we plot the adopted log(g ) value as calculated by the segue stellar parameters pipeline ( sspp , see lee et al . 2008 ; segue stands for the `` sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration '' , see yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) against @xmath7 .",
    "we note that in the blue color space of -0.3 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 there is excellent differentiation of the lower gravity bhb stars , residing in the range of 3.0 @xmath8 log(@xmath1 ) @xmath8 3.75 , and the higher gravity msa stars ( 3.75 @xmath8 log(@xmath1 ) @xmath8 5.0 ) . these color and gravity ranges form the basis for our identification of these two types of star .",
    "some contaminants have no sspp atmospheric parameters , so we can not identify them based on their log(g ) estimates : the two principal examples are white dwarf stars and quasars .",
    "white dwarf stars raise critical flags in the sspp because of the width of their balmer lines ( @xmath10 @xmath16 35.0  ) and quasars raise critical flags due to their strong emission lines @xcite . to identify these contaminants , we rely on the elodie template matches ( the elodie archive is a set of high resolution spectroscopic readings collected using the elodie spectrograph , which has been operating on the observatoire de haute - provence 1.93 m telescope since 1993 ; moultaka et al . 2004 ) as output by the sspp .",
    "the remaining contaminants are binned together they mostly consist of a and f stars for which the sspp gravity reading was either inconclusive or outside the bounds of the prior mentioned bhb and msa star bins .    using this data set we look to construct a photometric color cut in @xmath7 ( a temperature indicator ) vs @xmath12 ( a surface gravity indicator ) color space ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "to do this we use a k - nearest - neighbors classification algorithm .",
    "this algorithm classifies unknown objects based on their proximity to known objects .",
    "we compare a uniform grid in @xmath7 vs @xmath12 color space ( the grid consisting of 101x101 nodes over the color space -0.3 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 and -0.25 @xmath8 @xmath12 @xmath8 0.05 ) to the spectroscopic data grid nodes with 50% of their 5 nearest neighbors having been classified as bhb stars were said to reside in bhb color space .",
    "we then drew a rough selection box around this bhb color space defined by the points : ( @xmath7,@xmath12 ) = ( -0.30,-0.18 ) , ( -0.05,-0.06 ) , ( -0.05,-0.02 ) , ( -0.30,-0.02 ) .    in figure 2 we plot",
    "these 5 datasets : high gravity msa stars , low gravity bhb stars , spectroscopically identified white dwarfs , spectroscopically identified quasars and inconclusive points .",
    "the lower panel of the plot is a @xmath7 vs @xmath12 color - color plot : bhb stars are plotted with diamonds while contaminants are plotted with points .",
    "note that only 1 in 5 data - points are shown in the lower panel of the plot to avoid obscuration .",
    "however , the upper histogram shows all of the objects which are inside the selection box .",
    "it is apparent that this separation culls white dwarfs with acceptable efficiency .",
    "note that type dc white dwarfs were neglected from this analysis due to a lack of a sspp `` dc white dwarf '' classification and their intrinsically low numbers ( @xmath84% of all white dwarfs ) .",
    "additionally , one could use a proper motion diagram to remove some of the remaining white dwarfs and some of the closer msa stars .",
    "we do not get much more separation from the stellar contaminants in other color spaces .",
    "however , we can more efficiently select out quasar contaminants in the @xmath7 vs @xmath17 color space .",
    "we use @xmath17 color space due to the spectral profiles of blue stars which are characterized by the tail end of blackbody profiles ( tending to lower @xmath17 values ) and quasars which are more uniform emitters ( tending to higher @xmath17 values especially in the case of high redshifts ) . in figure 3",
    "we present this additional color cut .",
    "this cut is defined by the points : ( @xmath7,@xmath17 ) = ( -0.3,-0.72 ) , ( -0.3,-0.57 ) , ( -0.05,-0.08 ) , ( -0.05,-0.23 ) .",
    "we plot only the data which pass the cut shown in figure 2 .",
    "quasars are plotted as open circles and stellar sources are plotted as dots to accentuate the separation .",
    "again histogrammed above are the objects passing the color cut .",
    "as expected , we see very little change in the stellar contaminants , but quasar contamination drops significantly .    as a test of accuracy",
    ", we consider the number of stars falling within the color cut which are not bhb stars : out of @xmath184300 spectra which pass this cut , we find @xmath1877% of them to be bhb stars ; this represents a sample of @xmath1874% of the stars originally identified as bhb stars . for comparison ,",
    "we run a similar test on the same data using the color cut suggested by @xcite which is similar to the `` stringent '' color cut employed by @xcite ( @xmath19 @xmath11 @xmath8 1.28 , @xmath20 @xmath7 @xmath21 , excluding @xmath22/0.215)^2+([g - r+0.06]/0.17)^2 < 1 $ ] ) . using this refined u band dependent test",
    ", we similarly select a sample that is @xmath1874% pure and @xmath1872% complete .",
    "this test is biased by the sdss spectroscopic selection algorithms , and so is neither a strict test of purity nor completeness .",
    "we use a completeness test similar to the one employed by @xcite . using @xcite as a reference , we select 10 globular clusters from the sdss footprint with pronounced bhbs . by running the constituent stars through the photometric cut described above",
    ", we may get a second measure of how effective the algorithm is at extracting bhb stars .",
    "the clusters chosen and pertinent information is tabulated in table 1 .",
    "since the sdss @xmath23 pipeline fails for crowded fields , the cores of dense objects , such as globular clusters , are often omitted from the general photometric data . for accurate and complete cluster photometry",
    "we turn to the sdss `` value added '' catalogs in particular we use the `` @xmath13 daophot photometry of sdss+segue globular and open clusters '' catalog produced by @xcite .    since the @xcite value added catalog was created with sdss data release seven ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) imaging and pipelines , we use dr7 photometric data for this cluster analysis .",
    "data are selected from dr7 within one third of the tidal radii of the relevant clusters ( harris ( 1996 ) catalog , 2010 revision ) and then matched to the daophot photometry . in the cases of duplicate points ,",
    "daophot photometry is preferred .",
    "the stellar magnitudes and colors are extinction corrected and dereddened according to the harris catalog e(b - v ) values .    by examining the color - magnitude diagrams of the clusters , we visually select 1-magnitude wide boxes encompassing the main portion of the blue horizontal branch in the -0.3 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 regime .",
    "this selection box contains the stars we will consider `` true '' bhbs . all stars outside of these boxes will be considered `` false . ''",
    "it is apparent from clusters such as ngc 7078 and ngc 5272 that these 1-magnitude boxes suffer rr lyrae contamination on the red end and in the clusters ngc 6205 and",
    "ngc 6341 we see hot sub - dwarf contamination on the blue end .",
    "however , in general , these boxes should consist mainly of bhb stars .",
    "the ranges for these magnitude boxes are also given in table 1 and the cluster color - magnitude diagrams with the selection boxes superimposed are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we select only stars passing the color - cut selection described in  2 .",
    "we do not consider this test to be a test of accuracy due to the selective enrichment of bhb stars in these cluster - fields however , we do consider this to be a good test of completeness .",
    "stars passing our @xmath0 based color cut constitute a sample that is @xmath1895% pure and @xmath1851% complete .",
    "similar to  2 , we cut the data using the @xmath4 based `` stringent '' color selection and find a sample that is @xmath1892% pure and @xmath1857% complete ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we consider the statistics on the spectroscopic data to be a better indicator of accuracy and the globular clusters to be a better indicator of completeness .",
    "thus , when considering this test in conjunction with the spectroscopic statistics , we consider the @xmath4 based cut to be @xmath1874% pure and @xmath1857% complete which is in agreement with the values quoted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 based cut similarly has a @xmath1877% purity and a @xmath1851% completeness .",
    "to show the ability of this selection method to probe features of the milky way s structure , we examine the celestial equator .",
    "this area ( -1.26@xmath24 @xmath8 declination @xmath8 1.26@xmath24 ) has been almost completely imaged in the sdss , excepting areas too close to the galactic plane .",
    "the portion of this great circle above the galactic equator is known as stripe 10 ( see @xcite for stripe naming conventions in the sdss ) and the portion residing in the southern galactic hemisphere is stripe 82 .",
    "stripe 82 has been imaged repeatedly to promote studies of variable objects , such as supernovae @xcite , rr lyraes and quasars . as such",
    ", this section of the sky has been extensively probed for evidence of structure ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples ) .",
    "we create our sample by selecting all photometrically clean sources identified as point sources ( selecting only primary measurements in the case of duplicates ) residing in the plane of the celestial equator and pass their dereddened photometric data through the color cut suggested in  2 .",
    "we note that , in general , noise in spectra of stars fainter than @xmath1=18 throw errors into the parameter determinations ( sirko et al .",
    "2004 ; exceptions include segue pencil beams which were imaged for various time scales to maximize signal to noise ratios at two main magnitude bins , see yanny et al .",
    "2009) but since the ccd camera can reliably determine every color to much fainter magnitudes @xcite , photometric separation is still practical .",
    "photometric separation has the parallel benefit of being viable for a much more complete sample of stars when compared to spectroscopic methods .",
    "the results of our photometric selection are plotted in figures 5 ( the northern galactic hemisphere portion of the celestial equator ) and 6 ( the southern galactic hemisphere along the celestial equator ) .",
    "immediately evident are several well documented structures : among these are the sagittarius stream in both the northern and southern galactic hemispheres @xcite , the virgo overdensity @xcite in the north , and the hercules - aquila cloud in both the north and the south noted independently by @xcite and @xcite , and the anomalous density at r.a .",
    "= 160@xmath24 noted by @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the @xmath0 band shows gravitational separation due to the gravity sensitive paschen features ( the paschen analog to the balmer jump resides at 8201 ) , which lie in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we anticipate that this separation may be even more effective on the pan - starrs telescope which has a much more infrared sensitive ccd than the sdss imaging camera , and thus a more responsive @xmath0 filter @xcite .",
    "figure 7 depicts spectra of the objects discussed in this paper ( bhb stars , msa stars , white dwarfs , and quasars ) and includes the throughput functions of both the sdss 2.5 m telescope and the pan - starrs 1.8 m telescope .    to explain the difference in @xmath12 colors of bhb stars and msa stars , we examine high signal - to - noise spectra from the sdss survey with particular attention paid to the 7000-9200range .",
    "we collect fits images of all spectra in the sdss survey which have a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath6 50 , are primary science readings , and classified as stars .",
    "similar to  2 , we select stars in the -0.3 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 color range and define bhb stars as those in the 3.0 @xmath8 log(@xmath1 ) @xmath8 3.75 gravity range ; msa stars are defined as having 3.75 @xmath8 log(@xmath1 ) @xmath8 5.0 .",
    "we construct two `` super - spectra '' by combining all spectra from each population .",
    "the spectra were individually shifted in wavelength such that the minimum of their balmer-@xmath25 absorption feature fell at 6563to account for differing radial velocities .",
    "they were then normalized to their flux value at 7500 .",
    "it became apparent that , since our sample consisted of the whole -0.3",
    "@xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 0.0 color range ( which spans from about 7500k to 10000k ) a systematic difference in temperature needed to be accounted for ( as our bhb sample is centered on this color range , but our msa sample trends toward cooler , redder colors ) .",
    "we select bhb stars in the color range -0.15 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 -0.10 and msa stars in the color range -0.17 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath8 -0.12 these color ranges produced composite spectra which had approximately equal continua and balmer line depths .",
    "we then bin the spectra into 2 wide bins and accept the median values of these bins as the composite value .",
    "figure 8 shows the well known balmer-@xmath25 absorption feature for our two spectra .",
    "we easily discern the differing profile widths and shapes that are the basis for differentiation of these types of stars in spectroscopic studies ( e.g. pier 1983 , clewley 2002 ; the bhb features are significantly slimmer than their msa analogs ) . in the second frame",
    "we expand the paschen features of these two types of stars .",
    "it is unsurprising that we see a similar effect in the @xmath0 band features the bhb features are significantly slimmer . near a hydrogen absorption series limit",
    ", the features will overlap to form a quasi - continuum , thus the more intense stark pressure broadening of the msa stars makes their features wider and forces their pseudo - continua lower .",
    "this combination of slimmer absorption features and a higher paschen continuum explains the difference in @xmath0 band magnitude for bhb and msa stars at the same temperature .",
    "an interesting corrollary to this result is the possibility of using only the paschen features to separate bhb and msa stars spectroscopically . to examine this ,",
    "we consider only the area of the spectra between 8500and 9000 ; we only use this portion of the spectra since fitting to the entire spectra provides especially poor fits in the paschen region .",
    "the continuum is defined to be the portion of the spectra exactly in between any two paschen minima @xmath265 ( 2 standard deviation outliers are discarded) the continuum is then fit to a tertiatic , which is divided out .",
    "the resulting normalized spectra are analyzed using an iraf @xcite fitting routine .",
    "included in figure 8 is a plot of intensity vs the voigt profile equivalent width of the paschen line at @xmath188596 ( the paschen 14 line ) for the entire high signal to noise dataset .",
    "we see good separation of bhb and msa stars in this plot .",
    "notably , in this region , we see the bhb stars as having larger equivalent widths , which is counterintuitive .",
    "this is an effect of the pseudo - continuum shrinking the msa features artificially owing to their broad and extended wings @xcite an effect corroborated by the correspondingly higher core intensities of the bhb stars .",
    "in  3 we find , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , that @xmath4 based color cuts may photometrically select out samples of bhb stars which are @xmath1874% pure and @xmath1857% complete .",
    "we also show that the unexplored @xmath0 band is capable of selecting out samples of bhb stars with similar accuracies ( for structural studies , purity is more valuable than completeness ) , having achieved an estimated purity of @xmath1877% based on spectroscopic data and globular cluster analysis . however , since the a - star separation by gravity is weaker in the @xmath0 band than in the @xmath4 band ( as noted by lenz et al .",
    "1998 ) , we obtained a lower completeness of @xmath1851% . for increased accuracy ,",
    "we suggest a combination of the two techniques , since they extract overlapping but non - identical sets .    in  4",
    "we show that this color cut allows structure mapping in the milky way to large distances .",
    "structures such as the northern galactic portion of the sagittarius tidal stream , which are on the very edge of f - turnoff detectability , are easily discerned in their radial completeness .",
    "thus this method may be used for large - scale structural analysis in addition to high efficiency spectroscopic targeting . in ",
    "5 we show the spectroscopic reasoning for the @xmath0 band magnitude differences in bhb and msa stars namely that stark pressure broadening causes the continua of these stars to exist at fundamentally different levels . in short , we suggest that this algorithm is an excellent addition to existing photometric selection methods for structure characterization via bhb stars .",

    "<S> we make use of the sloan digital sky survey @xmath0 band as a surface gravity indicator and show its value for selecting bhb stars from quasars , white dwarfs and main sequence a type stars . using the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 bands , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that extraction accuracies on par with more traditional @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 photometric selection methods may be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the completeness necessary to probe major galactic structure may be maintained . </S>",
    "<S> our new method allows us to efficiently select bhb stars from photometric sky surveys that do not include a @xmath4 band filter such as the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system . </S>"
