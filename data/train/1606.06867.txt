    "the chameleon field , changing its mass in dependence of the density of its environment @xcite , has been invented to avoid the problem of the equivalence principle violation @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is accepted that the chameleon field , identified with quintessence @xcite , i.e. a canonical scalar field , can be useful for the explanation of the late  time acceleration of the universe expansion @xcite ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the chameleon field may shed light on dark energy dynamics @xcite@xcite . in terrestrial laboratories",
    "@xcite@xcite chameleon  matter interactions have been investigated in terms of ultracold neutrons , coupled to the chameleon field above a mirror @xcite and between two mirrors @xcite , as well as cold neutrons by using neutron interferometers @xcite and via atom interferometry @xcite with @xmath8 atoms as test particles , @xcite in the chameleon field theory with the ratra  peebles self  interaction potential . in these experiments",
    "the contribution of the chameleon field has been extracted in terms of the chameleon  matter coupling constant @xmath9 with the upper bounds @xmath10 ( qbounce experiment for ratra  peebles potential with index @xmath11 ) @xcite , @xmath12 ( neutron interferometry for the ratra ",

    "the new run of qbounce experiments with ultracold neutrons , using gravity resonance spectroscopy and invented for measurements of the transitions frequencies between quantum gravitational states of ultracold neutrons bouncing above a mirror @xcite , should give new upper bounds on the chameleon  neutron couplings .    in this paper",
    "we give the analytical solution for the chameleon field , confined between two parallel plates , in the chameleon field theory with ratra peebles self  interaction potential with index @xmath17 .",
    "such a potential is very popular in atom interferometry @xcite . in section [ sec : equation ]",
    "we write the equation of motion for the chameleon field and define the effective potential of the chameleon  matter and chameleon self  interactions . in section [ sec : solution ] we solve the equation of motion for the chameleon field profile in terms of jacobian elliptic functions . in section [ sec : phi0 ] we use the boundary conditions for the chameleon field and derive the equation for the definition of the parameter @xmath18 , which is the maximum value of the chameleon field between two parallel plates .",
    "we make numerical calculations of the parameters of the chameleon field profile . in section [ sec : transition ] we calculate the contributions of the chameleon field profile , derived in section [ sec : solution ] , to the transition frequencies of quantum gravitational states of ultracold neutrons . in section [ sec : region ]",
    "we discuss the allowed region of the chameleon  matter coupling constant@xmath9 , i.e. @xmath19 , which can be measured experimentally for the chameleon field coupled to neutron , confined between two parallel plates .",
    "we show that the maximum value @xmath20 depends on the density of the ambient matter @xmath21 and the distance @xmath1 between plates .",
    "such a dependence appears because of the not positive  definite of the first integral of the equation of motion of the chameleon field between two parallel plates .",

    "we would like to emphasize that currently such a sensitivity is not reachable at the qbounce experiments .",

    "finally we would like to mention the paper by burrage , copeland , and stevenson @xcite , where the authors solve the problem of the chameleon field , confined between two parallel plates . unlike our solution eq.([eq:14 ] ) , calculated for a non - vanishing matter density @xmath197 between two parallel plates , the solution eq.([eq:5 ] ) is calculated in @xcite at zero matter density @xmath141 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that because of the constraint @xmath198 together with eq.([eq:21 ] ) , caused by boundary conditions , the account for a non - vanishing matter density between two parallel plates restricts from above @xmath145 the values of the chameleon - matter coupling constant @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we calculate the chameleon field profile , confined between two parallel plates , filled with air at pressure @xmath0 and room temperature and separated by the distance @xmath1 , in the chameleon field theory with ratra  peebles self  interaction potential with index @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we give the exact analytical solution in terms of jacobian elliptic functions , depending on the mass density of the ambient matter . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained analytical solution can be used in qbounce experiments , measuring transition frequencies between quantum gravitational states of ultracold neutrons and also for the calculation of the chameleon field induced casimir force for the cannex experiment . </S>",
