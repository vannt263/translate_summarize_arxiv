    "there is growing evidence that the large - scale structure of the universe grew via gravitational instability from small primordial fluctuations in the matter density . for realistic models of structure formation",
    ", the initial spectrum of perturbations is such that at large scales , fluctuations are small and reflect the primordial spectrum .",
    "the variance of density fluctuations , @xmath13 , is a decreasing function of scale @xmath11 . at small scales",
    ", @xmath14 is large enough that non - linear effects become important .",
    "there are therefore two limiting regimes characterized by the value of @xmath14 : the _ linear regime _ at large scales , where @xmath15 , and the _ non - linear regime _ at small scales , where @xmath16 .",
    "the boundary between these two regimes defines a length scale , the correlation length @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . because of gravitational instability , @xmath17 grows with time and therefore a given scale eventually becomes non - linear under time evolution .    at early epochs ,",
    "the growth of density perturbations can be described by linear perturbation theory , provided that the linear power spectrum @xmath19 falls off less steeply than @xmath20 for small @xmath21 ( zeldovich 1965 , peebles 1974 , peebles & groth 1976 ) . in the linear regime , perturbation fourier modes evolve independently of one another , conserving the statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations . in particular ,",
    "if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian random fields , they remain gaussian in linear theory . in this case , the statistical properties of the density and velocity fields are completely determined by the two - point correlation function or the power spectrum .",
    "when the fluctuations become non - linear , coupling between different fourier modes becomes important , inducing non - trivial correlations that modify the statistical properties of the cosmological fields .",
    "for gaussian initial conditions , this causes the appearance of higher - order reduced correlations , which constitute independent statistics that can be measured in observational data and numerical simulations , even when the departure from the linear regime is small .",
    "non - linear cosmological perturbation theory provides a theoretical framework for the calculation of the induced higher - order correlation functions in the _ weakly non - linear regime _ , defined by scales @xmath11 such that @xmath22 . at large scales , leading order ( tree - level ) perturbation theory gives the first non - vanishing contribution , and has been used to understand the generation of higher order correlations in gravitational instability .",
    "comparison with fully non - linear numerical simulations has shown this approach to be very successful ( juszkiewicz , bouchet & colombi 1993 , bernardeau 1994b , okas et al .",
    "1995 , gaztaaga & baugh 1995 , baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou 1995 ) .    as one approaches smaller scales , however , next to leading order ( loop ) corrections to the tree - level results are expected to become important .",
    "the question then arises of whether our understanding of non - linear clustering can be extended from the largest scales into the transition region to the non - linear regime .",
    "this motivates us to consider one - loop cosmological perturbation theory . in previous work",
    "( scoccimarro & frieman 1996b , hereafter sf2 ) , we showed that for scale - free initial conditions , @xmath0 , without too much small - scale power ( spectral index @xmath23 ) , one can understand the evolution of the power spectrum down to scales where it begins to go over to the strongly non - linear stable clustering regime .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to consider one - loop corrections to the higher order correlation functions as well , to see if one can gain similar understanding of non - linear clustering on intermediate scales .    in this work we concentrate on one - loop corrections to the three - point function of density perturbations in fourier space ,",
    "also known as the bispectrum , and its one - point counterpart , the skewness .",
    "these are interesting quantities for several reasons . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the bispectrum is the lowest order correlation function which , for gaussian initial conditions , vanishes in the linear regime ; its structure therefore reflects truly non - linear properties of the matter distribution .",
    "furthermore , as the lowest order correlation function which depends on the vector character of its arguments , it gives direct physical information on the anisotropic structures and flows generated by gravitational instability .",
    "observationally , the configuration dependence of the tree - level bispectrum has been put forward as a promising statistic to study the important but poorly understood issue of bias ( fry 1994 ) , i.e. , the degree to which luminous objects in the universe such as galaxies are fair tracers of the underlying density field .",
    "it is therefore important to see how further non - linear effects ( which are inevitably present in observational studies ) alter this configuration dependence , to check whether one can still disentangle nonlinear evolution from bias .",
    "we focus on gaussian initial conditions and scale - free initial power spectra , @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to mathematical simplicity , primordial gaussian fluctuations have a broad physical motivation and are predicted by the simplest inflationary models . although the linear power spectrum for the universe is not scale - free ( on both observational and theoretical grounds ) , scale - free spectra are very useful approximations over limited ranges of wavenumber @xmath21 .",
    "they also have the advantage of yielding analytic closed form results and giving rise to self - similar evolution of the statistical properties of cosmological fields for spatially flat universes ( davis & peebles 1977 , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "in particular , self - similarity is a powerful aid towards a physical understanding of non - linear clustering and in many realistic models of structure formation we expect approximate self - similar evolution over a restricted range of length and time - scales ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "while the agreement between tree - level perturbation theory and numerical simulations in the weakly non - linear regime is well established , it was not until recent years that n - body simulations have been able to reliably follow the transition of higher order statistics into the non - linear regime .",
    "in this regard , for scale - free initial power spectra , the bispectrum in numerical simulations has been shown by fry , melott & shandarin ( 1993,1995 ) to depart from the tree - level perturbative results at scales comparable to the correlation length , as expected if next to leading order corrections are present .",
    "similarly , for the skewness of the density field , and for higher - order cumulants as well , deviations from the leading order calculations have been reported in the literature ( bouchet & hernquist 1992 , lucchin et al .",
    "1994 , juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 , hivon et al .",
    "1995 , colombi , bouchet & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore consider it appropriate to extend the leading order calculations to one - loop , in order to understand better the limitations of the tree - level results and see the extent to which one can improve the agreement of perturbation theory with fully non - linear numerical simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ cha : dynstat ]",
