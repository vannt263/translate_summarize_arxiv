    "in addition to being a planet hunter , the _ kepler _ satellite has uncovered a host of unexpected stellar phenomena , including new and exotic classes of binary stars .",
    "most stars form in binary stellar systems @xcite , making it imperative to understand their statistical properties since they expose the physical processes inherent in star formation and evolution .",
    "_ kepler _ data have revealed a new class of eccentric binaries in which the primary star undergoes tidal distortions and pulsations in response to perturbations from the secondary star .",
    "an early example , koi-54 , was reported by @xcite who observed a light curve that brightened by 7% every 41.8  days and exhibited additional modulations between maxima .",
    "they attributed the primary brightening to the tidal interaction of a binary system near periastron , while the higher frequency variations were interpreted as tidally induced oscillations .",
    "these objects had been predicted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but _ kepler _ allowed for an in - depth observational analysis of the tidal distortions . later works , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , have shown that the dominant brightening near periastron passage is likely due to resonantly locked @xmath5 modes that trace the period .",
    "* hereafter th12 ) reported the discovery of 17 additional such binary systems from the _ kepler _ archive ; the tally is now over 130 @xcite .",
    "the multi - modal nature of the light curves resembles an electrocardiogram , earning them the name `` '' .",
    "th12 determined an orbital period from the light curve and used the model of tidal distortions presented in @xcite to fit the eccentricity , angle of periastron , and orbital inclination to the shape of each _ kepler _ light curve . while the models of th12 appear to provide good fits to the data , their limited number of radial velocity measurements precluded a definitive measurement of the orbital parameters and could not address the velocity amplitudes and masses of the stellar components .    in this paper",
    ", we present a three - year campaign of optical spectroscopy for a small sample of heartbeat stars . we chose a sample of six stars from th12 as a pilot survey to directly measure orbital solutions and test the accuracy of the photometry - based model fits to the orbital parameters .",
    "we confirm the binary nature of these systems and find them to be short - period , eccentric binaries .",
    "thus , we provide an independent confirmation of the hypothesis that the unusual light curves of these systems stem from tidal interactions of eccentric binary star systems . our six targets were chosen to be representative of the sample of 17 systems presented in th12 , spanning the range of temperatures and periods while being bright enough to obtain high - signal - to - noise observations with the wyoming infrared observatory 2.3 m telescope .",

    "spectra were flat - fielded from dome quartz lamp exposures and wavelength calibrated using copper - argon arc lamp exposures to a rms of 0.02    ( 1.0  at 5800   )",
    ". exposures for a given star on a given night , taken sequentially in the observing sequence , were combined to yield one spectrum with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of over 70 per 0.63    pixel .",
    "all spectra were doppler corrected to the heliocentric reference frame .",
    "the mean uncertainty on the night - to - night velocity zero point was determined to be 4.1  rms based on extensive observations of ob stars within the cygnus ob2 association obtained at wiro over the same time period @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty was added in quadrature to the radial velocity uncertainty determined during cross correlation , discussed in section  [ ccm ] .",
    "for the system with the largest velocity amplitude , 1 , we expect the radial velocity to change by roughly 6  per hour near periastron . as the time for",
    "a series of exposures for this system is 1015 minutes , we would expect the total change in radial velocity to be less than 3  . because this is significantly less than our other velocity uncertainties ,",
    "we consider it negligible .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows a continuum - normalized spectrum of 4 ( t@xmath107600  k ) as a representative example of a heartbeat star .",
    "the strongest features in the spectrum are h@xmath11 and  d , which contains both stellar and interstellar components .",
    "additional weak features from low - ionization metals are abundant in the spectrum and not individually labeled , with the exception of at @xmath126347 and @xmath126371   .",
    "no telluric corrections have been applied , so atmospheric features are present in the spectra , principally the o@xmath13 band around 6300    and the h@xmath13o band around 5900   .",
    "we used the iraf task xcsao to measure radial velocities from the spectra using cross - correlation techniques .",
    "the xcsao task allows the user to specify a template spectrum against which to perform the cross - correlation .",
    "initially , we tried to use the highest signal - to - noise spectrum for each star in our sample as the template spectrum",
    ". however , even our best spectra had a signal - to - noise ratio just over 100 so the observational velocity uncertainties were on the order of 110  . as some of these systems , such as 5 , have velocity amplitudes of @xmath1410  , such large uncertainties preclude secure orbital solutions .",
    "we then tried performing the cross - correlation against synthetic spectra from the marcs @xcite model stellar atmospheres of the nearest available temperature and gravity to those reported in th12 . ;",
    "3 against a template of 6750  k with @xmath15 ; 4 against a template of 7500  k with @xmath16 ; 5 against a template of 7500  k with @xmath16 ; 6 against a template of 6750  k with @xmath15 . ]",
    "we corrected the vacuum wavelengths of the synthetic spectra to wavelengths in air and smoothed them by 1.1    to match the resolution of our spectra . to ensure that resulting velocities were not sensitive to a specific template , we performed a test on target stars at 6750  k , 7500  k , and 8000  k in which we cross - correlated against templates mismatched in temperature by several hundred to a few thousand kelvin .",
    "the resulting velocities changed by @xmath17  and the uncertainties increased by @xmath18  .",
    "similarly , we rotationally broadened a template by 100  and found that the average change in the measured velocity was less than 1.5  , much less than other velocity uncertainties inherent in our spectra . we conclude that the derived radial velocities are not sensitive to small mismatches in temperature , surface gravity , or rotational broadening between the star and template . with these synthetic spectra",
    ", we can both estimate a systemic velocity and obtain average velocity _ precisions _ of @xmath19  .",
    "the _ accuracy _ of the velocities is ultimately limited by the 4.1  night - to - night uncertainties on the velocity zero point .",
    "when correlating the stellar velocities with xcsao , the user can specify specific regions of the spectrum to be ignored in the correlation .",
    "it is particularly important , for example , to exclude the  d region because it contains both stellar and interstellar components .",
    "we considered four different combinations of spectral coverage in the cross - correlation .",
    "our first cross - correlation method did not exclude any lines in the spectrum and was deemed to yield an unreliable velocity because the of the presence of the interstellar component of the  d lines .",
    "the second method used only the h@xmath11 ( 65306585   ) portion of the spectrum and was also discarded as sub - optimal because of the broad wings of h@xmath11 leading to large velocity uncertainties .",
    "our third method removed both the sodium ( 58835903   ) and h@xmath11 features from the spectrum ; the errors on the resulting velocities became larger in the absence of the strong h@xmath11 line .",
    "our adopted method for measuring velocities removed only the  d region from the spectrum and used the cross - correlation of the plethora of metal lines and the strong h@xmath11 .",
    "the system 2 shows some line splitting around periastron passage , so a measurement of the second peak in the cross correlation gave the velocity of the secondary when splitting was evident .",
    "for the sb2 system 1 , whose components are nearly equal and therefore difficult to unentangle in the cross correlation spectrum , we instead measured the velocities of both components using a double gaussian fit to the @xmath126347 line .",
    "the width and depth of the gaussian fits were constrained using unblended spectra obtained near quadrature phase .",
    "the velocities were not measured using the cross - correlation described above because of the difficulty separating the two peaks of the cross - correlation function when the components were partially blended .",
    "typical velocity uncertainties using this approach were 37  , comparable to or larger than the night - to - night velocity zero point uncertainties .",

    "the hotter effective temperature found by th12 only serves to exacerbate the discrepancy between the synthetic and observed spectra . increasing the metallicity to",
    "[ + 0.5 ] and [ + 1.0 ] resulted in a slightly better fit to the sodium lines but a much poorer fit to the silicon and other metal lines , in the sense that the metal - rich models greatly overpredicted the strength of metal lines throughout the spectrum .",
    "thus , it is possible that these stars are more metal rich than solar or have peculiar metal abundances , but the difference is not reproducible with the available phoenix spectra .      knowing the orbital parameters for the stars of 1 , we calculate that the sum of the masses times @xmath186 is @xmath129  and that the mass ratio is @xmath187 .",
    "adopting th12 s inclination of 43 , the sum of the masses would be @xmath1410  .",
    "this would correspond to two late - type b stars , in strong disagreement with the fitted temperatures and spectral types .",
    "an inclination of 6671  is required to yield a sum of @xmath144  appropriate to two mid - type a stars .",
    "inclinations as low as 55  and as high as 80  may be allowed owing to the uncertainties on the components spectral types .",
    "th12 note that their calculated inclination for 1 seems low for an eclipsing system and that it may be underestimated .",
    "the most likely reason , according to their analysis , is because the model from @xcite does not include stellar irradiation .",
    "we have presented spectroscopic orbital solutions for six , further supporting the hypotheses of @xcite , @xcite , and others that this class of stars with highly variable light curves are indeed high - eccentricity binary systems .",
    "all six systems have best - fit eccentricities @xmath188 ( most above @xmath189 ) and periods of 720 days .",
    "the good agreement between our spectroscopic orbital solutions and the solutions derived from _ kepler _ light curves in th12 attests to the applicability of the @xcite model of static modes of gravitationally - induced tidal variations to  orbital element extraction .",
    "each system in our sample contains an a- or f - type primary component .",
    "the six systems , of which two are sb2s and four are sb1s , have minimum mass ratios @xmath1901.0 , making the secondaries probable m - dwarf stars or earlier . 1 is a double - lined system containing two mid - a stars with a mass ratio very close to unity . this system is",
    "reminiscent of koi-54 , the prototypical heartbeat system @xcite , which consists of two massive a - type stars in a 41-day orbit .",
    "our other sb2 , 2 , exhibits similarities to 1 , such as an eccentricity on the higher end of our sample , but has a smaller primary mass , longer period , and smaller mass ratio .",
    "the two sb2s have the highest mass ratios of our sample , and both sb2s have inclinations higher than reported in th12 .",
    "this may be an indication of stellar irradiation or other effects creating signatures in the light curve that are not included in the @xcite model .",
    "these limited data suggest that photometrically derived orbital elements systematically underestimate the inclination for high mass ratio systems , although more data would be required to confirm this observation .",
    "the  herein exhibit mass ratios @xmath191 , suggesting that relatively massive companions may be required to excite the tidal and pulsational modes that are the hallmark of these intriguing systems .",
    "however , a wide range of companions are allowed .",
    "on the basis of this limited sample size , there does not appear to be evidence for a correlation between primary mass and mass ratio or between orbital elements and mass ratio .",
