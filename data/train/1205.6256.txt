    "chip firing game is a discrete dynamical model which was first defined by a. bjorner , l. lovasz and w. shor while studying the ` balancing game ' @xcite .",
    "the model has various applications in many fields of science such as physics @xcite , computer science @xcite , social science @xcite and mathematics @xcite .",
    "the model is a game which consists of a directed multi - graph @xmath0 ( also called _ support graph _ ) , the set of _ configurations _ on @xmath0 and an _ evolution rule _ on this set of configurations . here",
    ", a configuration @xmath1 on @xmath0 is a map from the set @xmath2 of vertices of @xmath0 to non - negative integers . for each vertex @xmath3 ,",
    "the integer @xmath4 is regarded as the number of chips stored in @xmath3 . in a configuration @xmath1 ,",
    "vertex @xmath3 is _ firable _ if @xmath3 has at least one outgoing edge and @xmath4 is not smaller than the out - degree of @xmath3 .",
    "the _ evolution rule _ is defined as follows .",
    "when @xmath3 is firable in @xmath1 , @xmath1 can be transformed into another configuration @xmath5 by moving one chip stored in @xmath3 along each outgoing edge of @xmath3 .",
    "we call this process _ firing @xmath3 _ and write @xmath6 .",
    "an _ execution _ is a sequence of firing and is often written in the form @xmath7 .",
    "the set of configurations which can be obtained from @xmath1 by a sequence of firing is called _ configuration space _ , and denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "a cfg begins with an initial configuration @xmath9 .",
    "it can be played forever or reaches a unique fixed point where no firing is possible @xcite .",
    "when the game reaches a unique fixed point , @xmath10 is an _",
    "upper locally distributive lattice _ with the order defined by setting @xmath11 if @xmath12 can be transformed into @xmath13 by a ( possibly empty ) sequence of firing @xcite .",
    "a cfg is _ simple _ if each vertex is fired at most once during any execution to reach its fixed point .",
    "two cfgs are _ equivalent _ if their generated lattices are isomorphic .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the class of lattices generated by cfgs .",
    "it is a well - known result that @xmath15 @xcite , where uld stands for the class of upper locally distributive lattices .",
    "however , a precise structure of @xmath14 is unknown so far .",
    "our aim is to find a condition to completely characterize this class of lattices .",
    "the results in @xcite do not say much about the structure of @xmath14 .",
    "one of the most important discovery in our study is finding out a strong connection between the objects which seem to be far from each other .",
    "these objects are meet - irreducibles , simple cfgs , firing vertices of a cfg and systems of linear inequalities .",
    "in particular , we establish a one - to - one correspondence between the firing vertices of a simple cfg and the meet - irreducibles of the lattice generated by this cfg . using this correspondence",
    ", we achieve a full characterization of @xmath14 which is practical and can be used to construct an algorithm for the determination of the class of lattices generated by cfgs .",
    "in addition , our method can be applied to other chip firing game models such as the abelian sandpile model @xcite which has been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "this model is a restriction of cfgs on undirected graphs . in @xcite",
    ", the author studied the class of lattices generated by asms , denoted by @xmath16 , and showed that this class of lattices is strictly included in @xmath14 and completely contains the class of distributive lattices ( d ) . a full characterization for this class would strengthen our result . to get the full characterization for @xmath14",
    ", we use the important result presented in @xcite , that is a cfg is always equivalent to a simple cfg .",
    "a difficulty of getting a full characterization for @xmath16 is that we do not know whether similar assertion holds for asm , _",
    "whether an asm is equivalent to a simple asm , therefore the argument in @xcite does not seem to be transferable to asm .",
    "however , we overcome this difficulty by constructing a generalized correspondence between the firing vertices in a relation with their times of firing of a cfg and the meet - irreducibles of the lattice generated by this cfg . finally , we come up with a full characterization for @xmath16 . using the algorithm we built ,",
    "we have found a lattice in @xmath17 which is smaller than the one shown in @xcite .    in @xcite , to prove @xmath18 , the author studied simple cfgs on directed acyclic graphs ( dags ) and showed that such a cfg is equivalent to a cfg on an undirected graph .",
    "it is natural to study cfgs on dags which are not necessary to be simple .",
    "again our method is applicable to this model and we show that any cfg on a dag is equivalent to a simple cfg on a dag . as a corollary , the class of lattices generated by cfgs on dags is strictly included in @xmath16 .",
    "we also give a full characterization for the class of lattices generated by this model .",
    "section [ second section ] gives some preliminary definitions , notations and results on lattice and chip firing game .",
    "sections [ third section],[fourth section ] and [ fifth section ] are devoted to giving full characterizations on three classes of lattices generated by cfgs on general graphs , undirected graphs and directed acyclic graphs respectively . in the conclusion ,",

    "a more precise relation between these classes of lattices remains to be done .    from the study in this paper",
    ", it turns out to be interesting that a cfg defined on each studying class of graphs is equivalent to a simple cfg which again is defined on this class .",
    "it means that in the studying classes of graphs , the simple cfgs give a full description of their classes of lattices . at the moment , we are interested in a characterization of the classes @xmath508 of graphs such that simple cfgs are closed , _",
    "i.e. _ for a cfg defined on @xmath508 , we always can find a simple cfg which also is defined on a graph in @xmath508 and equivalent to the old one . for instance , how about the class of eulerian graphs ?",
    "are simple cfgs closed in this class ?",
    "finally , we are interested in the following computational problem : given a graph @xmath0 and a uld lattice @xmath31 , is @xmath31 generated by a cfg on @xmath0 ? the characterizations presenting here do not imply that they are applicable to this problem .",
    "so now , we have the practical characterizations for the classes of lattices generated by cfgs defined on three classes of graphs which are studied widely in literature , they are acyclic graphs , undirected graphs , and general graphs .",
    "we believe that our method presented here is not only applicable to these classes but also applicable to many other classes of graphs on which cfgs define .    9 p. bak , c. tang and k. wiesenfeld .",
