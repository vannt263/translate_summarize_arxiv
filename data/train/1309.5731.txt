    "<S> gravitational wave experiments have entered a new stage which gets us closer to the opening a new observational window on the universe . in particular , the einstein telescope ( et ) is designed to have a fantastic sensitivity that will provide with tens or hundreds of thousand ns - ns inspiral events per year up to the redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> some of such events should be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies . + we explore the prospects of observing gravitationally lensed inspiral ns - ns events in the einstein telescope . </S>",
    "<S> being conservative we consider the lens population of elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that depending on the local insipral rate et should detect from one per decade detection in the pessimistic case to a tens of detections per year for the most optimistic case . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of gravitationally lensed source in gravitational wave detectors would be an invaluable source of information concerning cosmography , complementary to standard ones ( like supernovae or bao ) independent of the local cosmic distance ladder calibrations .    </S>",
    "<S> maketitle    2em    1.5em    .5em    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +    our analysis was conservative as already stressed in respective places where conservative assumptions were made . however , the leading factor setting an order of magnitude to the strong lensing rate is the local inspiral rate of ns - ns systems . for optimistic scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that there are good reasons to believe that the einstein telescope would register strongly lensed gw signals . </S>",
    "<S> if discovered , such systems would be of considerable importance . </S>",
    "<S> time delays would have been measured with great accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> identification of double image would be easy : they would appear as two time delayed signals having similar temporal structure ( frequency drift ) with different amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> amplitude ratio would allow to infer the source position @xmath1 @xcite , break the degeneracy and infer luminosity distance to the source @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all this knowledge would be helpful in identification of lensing galaxy in the optical . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from potential candidates within the directional uncertainty of the et one would have to search for massive galaxy at redshift range suggested by the distance ratio in time delay ( [ time delay ] ) ( assuming some standard value of the hubble constant and typical velocity dispersion ) . </S>",
    "<S> then if found , lensing galaxy could be a subject of more detailed spectroscopic studies leading in the end to precise measurement of the hubble constant from time delay . </S>",
    "<S> exploration of this possibility will be subject of a separate paper . in order to discuss it in a detailed manner one should properly account for external convergence ( secondary lensing ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , there has recently been some progress in this field @xcite . </S>"
