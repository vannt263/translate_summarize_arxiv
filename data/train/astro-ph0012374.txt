    "until the advent of data from the chandra x - ray observatory , only a few examples of x - ray emission from features in radio jets were available .",
    "chandra now provides the required sensitivity and resolution to distinguish knots and hotspots of radio galaxies and quasars : we have already witnessed a doubling in the number of known x - ray jet emitters and the number will surely continue to grow .",

    "normally knots are found on the inner portion of fri jets whereas hotspots are mostly at the ends of frii jets .",
    "however , we are not trying to impose distinct definitions , and infer no physical differences beyond these generalities .",
    "the names appearing in the last column are meant to be a guide when you want to email someone to find out more ; they are obviously not meant to provide all the references .",
    "as more chandra and xmm data are published , these names will be updated ( eventually on a website ) .",
    "although thermal models were considered with the initial detections of jets , in all cases two rather serious problems are encountered : ( 1 ) how can we explain the existence of over - pressured hot gas which is both far from the galactic nucleus and has no obvious source of confinement to maintain the integrity of the emitting region , and ( 2 ) why are the faraday rotations and depolarizations predicted for even quite modest ( 10 @xmath1 g ) magnetic fields absent ?",
    "these arguments have been used against thermal models for the hotspots of cygnus a ( harris , carilli , & perley 1994 ) , the 25  knot of 3c  120 ( harris et al .",
    "1999 ) , and many other x - ray emitting hotspots and knots .",
    "synchrotron emission could be considered the ` process of choice ' for x - rays from knots in radio jets mainly because the optical polarization observed in sources such as m87 is convincing evidence that the optical emission as well as the radio emission comes from the synchrotron process .",
    "demonstrations that the x - ray intensity was consistent either with a single power law extrapolation from radio and optical bands ( e.g. 3c  390.3 , harris , leighly , & leahy 1998 ) or with a broken power law ( e.g. knot a in m87 , biretta , stern , & harris 1991 ) were taken as circumstantial evidence that the x - rays were also generated by synchrotron emission . required for this model is the presence of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "values of 10@xmath3 for optical emission ) . in the typical equipartition fields of b @xmath4 g",
    ", the radiation half - life of the x - ray emitting electrons would be of order 10 years .",
    "no overriding theoretical ( or other ) objections preclude this sort of model .",
    "inverse compton emission has a distinct advantage over x - ray synchrotron emission in that the extremely high energy for the emitting electrons is not required .",
    "what is required are both enough electrons and enough energy density in photons of the proper energy to produce the desired scattered photons : @xmath5 .",
    "although synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission is mandatory for all synchrotron sources , it is usually the case that the photon energy density ( @xmath6 ) is significantly smaller ( i.e. by factors of 100 or more ) than the energy density of the magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) and thus the major energy loss for all electrons is via synchrotron emission ( and the ssc component is too weak to observe or distinguish from other emissions ) .",
    "thus we have the often quoted result that the ratio of ic to synchrotron losses is given as : + r  =  @xmath8 . +",
    "another advantage of ssc over other processes is that accurate predictions of source strength can be made .",
    "if you have a reasonable estimate for the emitting volume , you can calculate the photon energy density from the synchrotron spectrum and then figure out what b field you need to have the right number of electrons to give the observed ( radio ) synchrotron and the observed ( x - ray ) ic emissions .",
    "there are three frii radio galaxies with convincing ssc x - ray emission from their ( terminal ) hotspots : cyga ( harris et al .",
    "1994 ) ; 3c  295 ( harris et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and 3c  123 ( hardcastle , birkinshaw , & worral 2000 ) . for all three of these sources ,",
    "predicted ssc emission was calculated from the radio data , proposals were written , and the hotspots were detected as predicted . in all cases , the average magnetic field strengths derived from the ssc equations are consistent with equipartition fields for the case of little or no contribution to the particle energy density from relativistic protons .",
    "the hotspots of these sources are , so far , the only resolved structures for which convincing ssc models have been published . since the ` proton induced cascade ' ( pic ) model is a sort of a ` sister process ' to ssc ( it requires extremely energetic relativistic protons and a high photon energy density ; mannheim , krlls , and biermann 1991 ) we have the following ` options ' for these hotspots :    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "synchrotron emission has classically been thought of as an extension of the radio / optical spectrum , as in the case of m87 where it was already evident 15 years ago that thermal models had problems , and the jet emissions were believed to be synchrotron on the basis of the observed polarization .",
    "* m87 knot a ( and d and b ) + the synchrotron parameters were derived from einstein data ( biretta et al . 1991 ) for knots a , d , and b. wilson now has chandra data , and it remains to be seen how the argument will go for the other knots ( marshall , private communication has the zero order image from an hetg observation which shows that most of the radio / optical knots are detected ) . *",
    "3c  390.3 - hotspot b + this source exhibits rather peculiar circumstances : a hotspot where the northern jet appears to collide with a dwarf galaxy in the 3c  390.3 group .",
    "prieto has published optical photometry ( prieto & kotilainen 1997 ) and the spectrum is a fairly good approximation to a single ( or broken ) power law .",
    "the group at heidelberg is working on a chandra observation of this source , but the results are not yet public . *",
    "3c  273 knots a1 and b1 + from archival hst data and chandra observations , all of the prominent optical knots in this jet are seen to have x - ray counterparts , see fig",
    ". three of these are bright enough and separated enough to derive reasonably accurate x - ray photometry .",
    "knot a1 has essentially a straight power law spectrum from the radio to the x - ray , with @xmath9 0.8 .",
    "b1 can also be fit with a broken power law , whereas d / h3 belongs to the classification of the next section .",
    "historically , jet x - ray targets were selected almost solely on the grounds that a radio feature had been detected in the optical , thereby indicating that perhaps the electron spectrum was not cut off at the usual value for most radio sources .",
    "actual detections were often serendipitous since there had been no expectation that the detected features would be x - ray emitters",
    ". two obvious examples of this are 3c 120 and pks0637 .    for 3c  120 , we proposed rosat observations in an attempt to detect the inner jet seen in the optical .",
    "instead , we found emission form a relatively unremarkable radio knot further out in the jet ( harris et al .",
    "1999 ) . since a good upper limit in",
    "the optical precluded a monolithic single or double power law fit from the radio to the x - ray , none of the simple emission models was acceptable .    in the case of the x - ray jet in pks 0637 ( schwartz et al .",
    "2000 & chartas et al .",
    "2000 ) , the quasar was targeted by chandra for focusing tests on the assumption that it would be a point source .",
    "although there is optical emission from this jet , the intensities are low enough that the situation is similar to 3c  120 .",
    "other examples for which the spectrum appears to have a cutoff in the optical are knot d / h3 in the 3c  273 jet and the hotspot of pictor a ( rser , private communication and wilson , young , & shopbell , 2001 ) .    for these sources ,",
    "the ssc calculations yield predictions which are 2 orders of magnitude or more below the observed intensities and the spectrum shows that extrapolation of the radio / optical flux densities would also under predict the x - ray intensity by a large factor .",
    "* with a few exceptions ( e.g. smooth , featureless jets such as that emanating from the core of pictor a , wilson et al . 2001 ; and the 3c  273 jet where the radio emission from the optical / x - ray knots is swamped by brighter , larger structures ) we usually see large gradients in the radio surface brightness which implies that strong shocks are present at the sites of x - ray emission . * for the data i have seen , _ all _ _  of the ` problem ' x - ray knots occur only on one side of the core .",
    "this suggests that relativistic beaming may be present . _",
    "_ _      one possibility is the presence of ad hoc flat spectrum components embedded in the larger scale structures responsible for the radio and optical emissions .",
    "we use the term ` ad hoc ' in the sense that such a distinct spectral component has not been detected at other wavebands .",
    "can we devise models with flat spectra so that the optical emission is below current limits and the radio components are too faint to be detected or are lost in the brighter emission from steeper spectrum components ?",
    "this sort of model was suggested for the 25  knot in 3c  120 ( harris et al .",
    "1999 ) , but now we require an extension to distributed features ( e.g. the narrow jet from pictor a or the underlying smooth emission in 3c  273 ) .",
    "current limits call for the x - ray to optical spectral index to be flatter than 0.5 .",
    "although canonical shock acceleration provides only for @xmath10 0.5 , oblique shocks can produce flatter spectra ( gieseler and jones 2000 ) .",
    "the other viable explanation is based on the premise that even far from the core , the jet is moving with significant relativistic bulk motion , @xmath11 ( celotti , ghisellini , & chiaberge 2000 ; tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "quite normal radio knots created with the usually invoked shocks in the jet experience an energy density of the cmbg which is @xmath12 larger than for a source at rest . when both the radio and inverse compton emissions are beamed towards the observer , it is possible to produce the observed intensities with beaming factors of order 10 .",
    "this model is appealing in that it would solve a long standing problem , but it remains to be seen if it is not liable to ` over - production ' : can it be demonstrated that only a select few of all radio jets will fulfill the required conditions ?",
    "the optical morphology of the 3c  273 jet bears a striking resemblance to a barber shop pole : regularly spaced segments of a helix appear to be the cause of the knots , see figure 2 . if most jets consist of particles moving along helical paths , beaming can become operative even if the overall jet direction does not make a small angle to the line of sight .      for ssc from terminal hotspots :",
    "b(ssc ) @xmath13 b(eq ) with no protons .",
    "the inference is that frii jets consist of e+/e- and that entrainment is not significant .",
    "the ssc model also provides some reassurance that conventionally computed equipartition fields stand a good chance of being correct .",
    "nb : pic with higher b field is an alternate model and would most likely require a normal plasma for the jet fluid .    for synchrotron models of knots",
    ": unless bulk velocities are playing an important role via boosting , @xmath14 and halflives of order a few years are required . in the beaming model , the x - ray emission originates from @xmath15 of order a few hundred and we would be evaluating the electron spectrum at the very lowest energies .",
    "many colleagues made significant contributions to the results reported here .",
    "although it is impossible to name them all , a few are : c. walker who worked on our new vla data of 3c  120 , j. p. leahy who did the same for 3c  390.3 , j. grimes produced the results for the optical data on 3c  273 , h. marshall is leading the cxc work on 3c  273 and l. david , p. nulsen , and t. ponman obtained the chandra spectral results on 3c  295 .",
