    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the promising extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the model requires superpartners of the standard model particles ( sparticles ) , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern might confirm the existence of the new particles @xcite .",
    "the lhc is a @xmath5 collider at @xmath6 tev , whose operation is currently expected to start in 2007 .",
    "the integrated luminosity will be 10  fb@xmath7/year at the beginning ( low luminosity runs ) , and then upgraded to 100  fb@xmath7/year ( high luminosity runs ) .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) must be broken and the sparticle mass spectrum depends on the susy breaking mechanism .",
    "measurement of the sparticle masses provides a way to probe the origin of the susy breaking in nature .",
    "the sparticle mass measurement at the lhc has been therefore extensively studied .    among the sparticles the third generation squarks , stops ( @xmath8 ) and sbottoms ( @xmath9 ) ( @xmath10 ) , get special imprints from physics at the very high energy scale .",
    "one of the examples is found in a model with universal scaler masses",
    ". although the scalar masses are universal at a high energy scale , the third generation squarks are much lighter than the first and second generation squarks due to the yukawa running effect . on the other hand ,",
    "some susy breaking models , such as the flavor u(2 ) model @xcite or the decoupling solution @xcite , and the superconformal model @xcite for the susy flavor problem , have non - universal boundary conditions for the third generation mass parameters at the gut scale .",
    "in addition , the @xmath11-@xmath12-higgs trilinear coupling @xmath13 is comparable to the gluino mass at the weak scale when the origin of the susy breaking comes from the gut scale or the planck scale physics .",
    "this appears in the stop mass matrix with a large coefficient @xmath14 ; @xmath15 .",
    "the stop left - right mixing is therefore expected to be sizable , leading to an even lighter stop mass compared to those of other squarks @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the stop masses and the mixing are very important parameters to predict the light higgs mass @xcite , or the rare @xmath16 decay ratios @xcite .",
    "we may be able to access the nature of the stop and sbottom at the lhc provided that they are lighter than the gluino ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "they may copiously arise from the gluino decay if the decay is kinematically allowed .",
    "the relevant decay modes for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath18 , to charginos @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) or neutralinos @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are listed below ( indices to distinguish a particle and its anti - particle is suppressed unless otherwise stated ) for this paper . ] , @xmath23 in previous literatures  @xcite , the lighter sbottom @xmath24 is often studied through the mode ( i)@xmath25 , namely the @xmath26 channel .",
    "this mode is important when the second lightest neutralino @xmath27 has substantial branching ratios into leptons .",
    "the difference of sparticle masses such as @xmath28 is determined by measuring kinematical end points of invariant mass distributions for signal events .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we proposed to measure the edge position of the @xmath1 distribution for the modes ( iii)@xmath29 and ( iv)@xmath30 , where @xmath1 is the invariant mass of a top - bottom ( @xmath4 ) system .",
    "the decay modes are expected to be dominant in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) , since the branching ratios @xmath31 could be as large as 60% .",
    "we focused on the reconstruction of hadronic decays of the top quark , because the @xmath1 distribution of the decay makes a clear `` edge '' in this case . the parton level @xmath1 distributions for the modes ( iii)@xmath32 and ( iv)@xmath33 are expressed as functions of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the chargino mass @xmath37 : @xmath38 , and the edge position ( end point ) of the @xmath1 distribution @xmath39 for the modes ( iii)@xmath32 and ( iv)@xmath33 are written as follows ; @xmath40 the measurement of the end points is sensitive to both @xmath35 and @xmath41 , provided that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined from other measurements .",
    "the edge height is then closely related to @xmath44 . in some model parameters",
    "@xmath45 is very close to @xmath46 .",
    "when they are experimentally indistinguishable , it is convenient to define a weighted mean of the end points ; @xmath47 as the final states @xmath48 from the decay chain @xmath49 ( mode ( iii)@xmath50 ) could have an irreducible contribution to the @xmath4 final state , they are included in the definition of @xmath51 .",
    "in the previous paper we showed that the weighted mean @xmath51 was successfully measured from a fit to the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "we also discussed the interpretation of the measurement . in this paper",
    "we significantly extend our study to the branching ratio measurements , identification of the stop and sbottom decays into heavier charginos , and the interpretation in the msugra model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  ii , we explain our reconstruction and fitting procedure of the edge structure in detail .",
    "we use a sideband method to estimate the background distribution due to misreconstructed events , which plays a key role in the edge reconstruction .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the distribution of the signal modes ( iii ) and ( iv ) after subtracting the sideband background is very close to the parton level distribution . in section  iii ,",
    "we explore the msugra parameter space to check if our fitting procedure reproduces the end point @xmath51 and the number of events going through the decay modes ( iii ) and ( iv ) .",

    "the lhc s potential to extract the top polarization arising from the decay @xmath53 is discussed in section  vi . section  vii is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in the msugra model the sparticle spectrum is parameterized by the universal scalar mass @xmath54 , the universal gaugino mass @xmath55 , the trilinear coupling of the scalar fields @xmath56 at the gut scale ( @xmath57 ) , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values @xmath58 , and sign of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath59 . in order to demonstrate the end point reconstruction , we take an msugra point with @xmath60  gev , @xmath61  gev , @xmath62  gev , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "for the other points , the efficiency can also be expressed as a linear function of @xmath42 except the sample point c. the gluino mass dependence arises from the pre - selection cut @xmath185  gev .    the reconstruction efficiency at the point c ( a circle in fig .",
    "[ acceptance ] ) is lower by 20% from the linear fit ( the dashed line in fig .",

    "therefore the ratio may play a role to determine the fundamental parameters .",

    "they are identified as a two @xmath83-jet event when two @xmath83-jets are tagged and the other two are mis - tagged .",
    "these events decrease the fraction from the decay chain ( iii ) and ( iv ) in the two @xmath83-jet events . assuming a tagging efficiency of 60% for a single @xmath83-jet ,",
    "35% of the four bottom quark events are identified as two @xmath83-jet events , and only 1/3 of them contain a @xmath83-jet pair originated from a single gluino decay .",
    "the wrong @xmath83-jet pair combinations significantly dilute the edge mode .",
    "study of events with three @xmath83-jets and four @xmath83-jets is necessary for this case .",
    "* the @xmath4 signal from the stop pair production could be significant if the stop is much lighter than the gluino .",
    "for example , only 4.7% of the susy events comes from the stop pair production at the point a1 , while it amounts to be about 17% at the point t1 .    in the msugra model , both the right - handed stop and",

    "dominate over the gluino decays to @xmath161 in the region . because the events with @xmath94 bosons remain after the @xmath94 sideband subtraction , the reconstruction efficiency @xmath182 is expected to be similar for those decay modes .",
