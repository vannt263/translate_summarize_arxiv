    "to identify line emission objects requires that we subtract the continuum emission underlying the _ nb_403 bandpass .",
    "we estimate the continuum using existing , deep broadband ( _ u _ and _ b _ ) images . for the cdfs ,",

    "we also show the narrow and broadband filter transmission curves for all fields in figure [ fig : filter_response ] .",
    "we reduce the narrowband images with the iraf _ mscred _ mosaic data reduction package @xcite following the procedures of the noao deep wide field survey team .",
    "the data are corrected for crosstalk between amplifiers and bias - subtracted . for flat - fielding , we use dome flats together with night - sky flats , which are median - combined from unregistered object frames each night .",
    "satellite trails , ccd edges , bad pixels , and saturated pixels are masked .",
    "the astrometry is calibrated with the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite using the iraf _ ccmap _ task .",
    "the individual images are transformed to have the same pixel scales and world coordinate systems ( wcs ) as the reference broadband images .",

    "ii pixel scale ( 027 pixel@xmath6 ) to make the reference images . finally , the projected images are scaled using common stars in each frame and stacked to remove cosmic rays . for flux calibration",
    ", we employ the 35 spectrophotometric standard stars observed each night to derive extinction coefficients and zero points for the _ nb_403 magnitudes .",
    "typical uncertainties in the derived zero - points are 0.020.04 mag .",
    "these uncertainties are added to the photometry errors in quadrature .",
    "in addition to the standard reduction procedures described above , we pay special attention to the `` crosstalk '' that occurs between ccds ( or amplifiers ) sharing the readout electronics .",
    "the net effect of crosstalk is that a very bright or saturated source on one chip ( or amplifier ) produces echos or ghost images on the paired chips with proportional intensities , typically 0.020.2% , up to several counts .",
    "one can determine these proportionalities , known as crosstalk coefficients , using the science image itself , and thus remove echo images .",
    "in most circumstances , this crosstalk correction works well and does not affect the detection and photometry of bright sources .",
    "furthermore , dithered exposures often average out the ghost images in the individual frames when stacked to make the final products .    however , residual ghost images from imperfect correction can be easily confused with low surface brightness objects .",
    "in particular , for ctio mosaic  ii , the crosstalk images of a source at pixel ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) on one chip appears at the same pixel coordinates on the other chips ( victim chips ) .",
    "therefore , ghost images always appear at the same location relative to real sources in the dithered exposures , and they will be co - added in the final combined images , leading to false detections mimicking diffuse extended emission .    to weed out false detections , we repeat the entire reduction procedure doubling the crosstalk coefficients so that the ghost images are over - corrected and appear as negative counts . if a blob candidate is indeed an artifact arising from imperfect correction , it will show up as a negative image in the final combined image .",
    "figure [ fig : crosstalk_correction ] shows an example in which one artifact image appears as a negative mirror image , whereas a real object is not affected by this crosstalk over - correction .",
    "note that the artifact is as bright as the real blob candidate , demonstrating that special care is required to reject false detections for extremely low - surface brightness objects like ly@xmath0  blobs .",
    "to find ly@xmath0  blob candidates , we construct photometric catalogs in the _ nb_403 narrowband and two broadbands ( _ u _ and _ b _ ) using sextractor .",
    "first , we make `` detection '' images ( _ nb_+_u_+_b _ ) by adding the _ nb_403 and broadband images after scaling them according to their signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) . after identifying sources in the `` detection '' images that have least 2 pixels that are 1.5@xmath41 above the local sky , we run sextractor in double - image mode on the _",
    "nb_403 , _ u _ , and _",
    "b _ images using these detection images . in other words",
    ", we first find the sources in the `` detection '' images and then obtain photometry at their position in the _",
    "nb_403 , _ u _ , and _",
    "b _ images to construct three separate ( one narrow- and two broadband ) catalogs .",
    "we adopt kron - like elliptical aperture magnitudes ( i.e. , mag_auto in sextractor ) to derive photometric properties .",
    "our use of the `` detection '' images ensures that 1 ) all the sources detected in either _ nb _  or the broadbands are included in our catalog and 2 ) the elliptical apertures of the more extended sources in the ( _ nb_+_u_+_b _ ) image are large enough to include all the light from both the _ nb _  and broadband images .",
    "note that this choice of photometric aperture is different from the classical ly@xmath0emitter searches that adopt a small circular aperture ( a few @xmath4 fwhm of seeing ) to detect fainter sources .",
    "the selection of ly@xmath0  blob candidates from the _ nb _  and broadband photometric catalogs consists of two steps : 1 ) selection for line ( hopefully , ly@xmath0 ) emitting objects with large line equivalent widths and 2 ) selection for spatially extended objects with a larger angular extent in line emission than in the broadbands .",
    "in other words , we define a `` blob '' as an object whose ly@xmath0  emission above a certain surface brightness threshold is more extended than its stellar continuum , thus representing light from the intergalactic medium .",
    "first , we choose candidates by requiring that they are detected above the completeness limits of the _",
    "nb_403 images ( _ nb_403 @xmath42 24.5 mag ) .",
    "all candidates must have observed - frame equivalent widths larger than 100  ( ew@xmath43 @xmath9 30.3 ) , corresponding to ( @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 ) @xmath9 1.2 , where _ ub _ represents the ab magnitude of the average continuum flux density within the _",
    "nb_403 band ( @xmath47 ) estimated from the _ u _  and _ b _  band images , @xmath44 @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "we estimate @xmath47 and the line flux ( @xmath50 ) of these objects using the following relations : @xmath51 \\\\ \\nonumber f_{line }            & = & f_{n\\!b }   - f^{n\\!b}_{cont } \\delta\\lambda_{n\\!b } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the total flux in each filter derived from the _ u _ , _ b _ , and _",
    "nb_403 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 represent the band - widths of the _ u _ , _ b _ and _ nb _  filters , respectively .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the average flux density of galaxy continuum within the _ u _  and _ b _  bands , respectively . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the correction factors that we use to remove the _",
    "light from each broadband when estimating @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ fig : color_mag ] shows the ( _ ub _ @xmath45 _ nb _ ) color as a function of _ nb _  magnitude for all objects detected in either the narrow or broad bands within our survey area .    in cdfs , cosmos1 , and cosmos2 , bright ( 18 @xmath62 _ nb _",
    "@xmath62 22 ) sources , mostly stars and nearby galaxies , have an average ( @xmath63 ) color that is consistent with zero ( @xmath64@xmath650.18 , 0.13@xmath650.17 , and 0.12@xmath650.12 , respectively ) . in the cdfn , however , they have an average color of ( @xmath63 ) @xmath8 @xmath66 mag , which suggests absorption features in our narrowband that are very unlikely . because this @xmath67 mag offset disappears when we adopt continuum measurements ( in _ u and g _ ) from the sloan digital sky survey , we apply a small correction ( 0.2 mag ) to the cdfn broadband magnitudes @xcite such that @xmath68 @xmath69 0 for the bright sources .",
    "although we can not explain the apparent problem with the cdfn broadband photometry in @xcite , the selection of our blob sample is unaffected by the applied correction .    at our survey redshift ,",
    "the only possible interlopers are nearby [ ] @xmath703727 emitters at @xmath71 .",
    "however , such objects rarely have equivalent widths larger than 100  in the rest frame @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the contamination of our @xmath18 ly@xmath0  source catalog by nearby star forming galaxies is minimal .",
    "second , we identify those line - emission selected objects that are more spatially extended in ly@xmath0  than their continuum counterparts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : size_luminosity ] ) .",
    "this selection definition is the same as that adopted by @xcite and somewhat different than that of @xcite , who select spatially extended objects by requiring the fwhm in their intermediate - band to be larger than that in the broadband or continuum image ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we measure the spatial extent of the ly@xmath0  emission in the continuum - subtracted images .",
    "after registering the _ nb_403 and broadband images ( _ u _ and _ b _ ) at the sub - pixel level and matching their seeing , we construct continuum - subtracted _ nb_403 images by applying the relations in eq.([eq : continnum - subtraction ] ) in 2-d .",
    "we measure the isophotal area of the emission region by running sextractor with a threshold of @xmath72 ergss@xmath6@xmath73arcsec@xmath74 , which corresponds to 3@xmath41 , 1.8@xmath41 , 2.2@xmath41 , and 2.1@xmath41 above the local sky in the cdfs , cdfn , cosmos1 , and cosmos2 fields , respectively .",
    "this measurement threshold is @xmath8 2.5@xmath4 higher than that adopted by @xcite .",
    "however , because our survey redshift ( @xmath18 ) is lower than theirs ( @xmath75 ) , we gain a factor of @xmath8 2.4 in surface brightness , thus achieving equivalent surface brightness ( 8.6@xmath410@xmath76 @xmath77 kpc@xmath74 compared to their 8.2@xmath410@xmath76 @xmath77 kpc@xmath74 ) .",
    "we also estimate local sky background using a fairly large background mesh size ( @xmath8 60@xmath460 ) , so as not to mistakenly subtract the extended ly@xmath0  emission as a local background .",
    "measuring the size of a low surface brightness feature is always subject to the noise and filtering .",
    "after testing the various smoothing filters in sextractor , we adopt a 5@xmath45 pixel@xmath1 gaussian kernel with fwhm = 2 pixels to compromise between signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and over - smoothing .",
    "we choose this truncated smoothing kernel such that it can enhance s / n in the low surface brightness wings while not spreading the bright core into the outer part .",
    "we note that the measured isophotal area depends strongly on the choice of the filters and recommend specifying the smoothing kernel and detection threshold when reporting blob size to allow a direct comparison between different samples .",
    "appendix [ sec : blob_comparison ] shows what sizes and fluxes the 35 blobs from @xcite would have if those blobs were measured following our procedures . in our survey , the @xcite blobs would be smaller , and the smallest blobs would have an isophotal area of @xmath7 @xmath8 10 .",
    "therefore , we adopt this value as the size lower - bound when selecting our blob sample",
    ".    one of the potential problems in detecting a blob is contamination by point sources . to quantify this effect , we place artificial point - sources with a range of luminosities ( @xmath3 = 10@xmath78  10@xmath79 ergss@xmath6 ) into the sky regions and measure their sizes and fluxes in the same manner as for the extended sources .",
    "we then determine the isophotal area versus luminosity limits above which extended and point sources can be differentiated .",
    "figure [ fig : size_luminosity ] shows the distribution of the angular sizes and line luminosities of the ly@xmath0-emitting blob candidates assuming that they are all at @xmath18 .",
    "the open and filled circles represent the line - emitting objects selected using our line - emission criteria ( fig .",
    "[ fig : color_mag ] ) , and the gray dots show the relation between size and brightness for the artificial point sources . to choose the final blob candidates , we select objects with isophotal areas larger than 10  that lie more than 4@xmath41 above the @xmath80@xmath7 relation defined by the point sources . below these limits , extended and point sources mix , and the sizes of blobs can not be measured reliably , as explained below .",
    "because the chosen isophotal threshold is comparable to the rms sky noise ( 1.8@xmath41  3@xmath41 depending on the field ) , we test how reliably we can measure the spatial extent of the blob candidates .",
    "we cut a small ( 101@xmath4101 pixel@xmath1 ) section around each candidate from the line - only image , filter it with a smoothing kernel ,  place each postage stamp into @xmath8 1000 empty sky regions , and extract the sources with sextractor in the same way as for the real data .",
    "then we check how often and accurately the blob sizes are recovered from these simulated images .",
    "the recovery fraction ( @xmath81 ) represents how frequently an artificial blob is recovered with a size larger than 10 .",
    "the size error becomes comparable to the measured size below our sample selection limits , and @xmath81 drops from @xmath1090% to @xmath850% at the selection boundary for the brightest blob candidates .",
    "our `` blob '' definition requires their ly@xmath0  emission to be more spatially extended than their stellar continuum emission .",
    "thus , their extended light represents the intergalactic medium instead of the galaxies .",
    "our choice of size cut is not due to any discontinuity , and is limited only by the ground - based seeing .",
    "therefore , higher spatial resolution images would likely detect fainter or more compact blobs .",
    "stacked images of lbgs ( lyman break galaxies ) do reveal faint extended emission @xcite .",
    "the total area of our survey is @xmath8 1.2 deg@xmath1 .",
    "our ly@xmath0  blob ( lab ) selection criteria , ew@xmath82 @xmath9 100  and @xmath7 @xmath9 10  above the surface brightness threshold of 5.5 @xmath4 @xmath83 ergss@xmath6@xmath73arcsec@xmath74 , yield a total of 16 , 5 , 3 , and 1 blob candidates in the cdfs , cdfn , cosmos1 , and cosmos2 fields , respectively .",
    "we list their basic properties in table [ tab : properties ] : coordinates , ly@xmath0  luminosity , and isophotal area .",

    "nb_403 band , continuum - subtracted ly@xmath0  line emission , and three broadbands ( _ ubr _ ) overlayed with the ly@xmath0  contour corresponding to a surface brightness of 4 @xmath4 10@xmath84 ergss@xmath6@xmath73arcsec@xmath74 .",
    "although we select blob candidates quantitatively , follow - up visual inspection indicates that the spatial extents of four blobs are not clearly larger than the local psf : cdfn - lab02 , cdfn - lab03 , cosmos - lab01 , and cosmos - lab02 .",
    "therefore , we flag them as `` marginal '' . excluding them",
    "does not affect our conclusion regarding the large field - to - field variation in the blob number density and , in fact , makes that case stronger .",
    "the largest blobs ( more than 16 ; the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : size_luminosity ] ) are the most robustly extended and are comparable to those identified in other surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , we treat them separately as the `` bright / large '' subset of the entire blob sample in the clustering analysis in  [ sec : cosmic_variance ] .    the blob candidates have a wide range of sizes and line luminosities : @xmath7 = 10 60  and @xmath3  = 0.78@xmath4@xmath5 ergss@xmath6 .",
    "they show diverse morphologies ranging from compact ( the south - west clump of cdfs - lab01 ) to diffuse ( cdfs - lab05 ) to highly elongated ( cdfs - lab08 and 16 ) .",
    "we do not find any bubble - like structures that might be associated with superwinds like those in a few of the blobs identified by @xcite .",
    "we are following up the entire blob sample spectroscopically . to date , we have observed five blobs ( cdfs - lab01 , 02 , 04 , 10 , 14 ) of the 16 in the cdfs .",
    "we confirm all five spectroscopically with their ly@xmath0and / or h@xmath0 lines .",
    "the details of our spectroscopic campaigns are presented in a forthcoming paper ( yang et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the properties of continuum objects associated with blobs provide valuable clues to the source of blob emission ( yang et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "for example , the blob discovered in the cdfs at @xmath75 by @xcite is not associated with any continuum source within @xmath83  ( but see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that this blob is powered by cooling radiation or cold mode accretion .",
    "although most blob candidates in our sample have clear continuum source counterparts in the rest - frame uv images , two blobs ( cdfs - lab04 and cdfs - lab05 ) do not .",
    "we are , however , able to identify continuum sources within these blobs in deep , rest - frame _ uv _ _ hst _ images ( gems and goods - s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . preliminary inspection of the multiwavelength images also reveals bright ir or x - ray sources in these blobs .",
    "interestingly , we often find _ multiple _ continuum sources in a blob , notably in lab02 and lab03 .",
    "our initial examination of the _ hst _ images of the 16 ly@xmath0  blobs in the cdfs often resolves these sources as galaxies , suggesting that star formation and/or nuclear activity might play a role in producing the ly@xmath0  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this apparent clustering of sources within some blobs may indicate that blobs are the progenitors of groups or clusters of galaxies today .",
    "we test this possibility quantitatively in  [ sec : cosmic_variance ] .",
    "there is no evidence of a discontinuity between the properties of our blobs and unresolved , compact ly@xmath0  emitting ( lae ) galaxies ( i.e. , the sources below the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : size_luminosity ] ) .",
    "the smoothness of the lae - to - lab transition , which has also been observed by @xcite , suggests that these two types of ly@xmath0sources may not be distinct and that whatever mechanism or mechanisms power blobs work over a wide range of luminosity and spatial extent .",
    "understanding the origin of the extended ly@xmath0  emission requires us to probe the host galaxy properties  including the stellar mass , star formation rate , and size of the star - forming region  along the emitter - to - blob sequence .",
    "if extended star formation or agn are responsible for powering the emission , we would expect that the properties of blobs ( @xmath7 , @xmath3 ) are correlated with either star formation rate or x - ray luminosity of the host galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that a correlation between the ly@xmath0  and bolometric ( actually fir ) luminosity ( although weak ) suggests that the interaction of an ambient halo of gas with a galactic - scale superwind is responsible for the majority of labs . we discuss the multi - wavelength properties of galaxies within or near the blobs , considering them as possible energy sources , in a separate paper ( yang et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "surprisingly , most blobs ( 16/25 ) and all eight of the brightest , largest blobs ( @xmath7 @xmath9 16 , @xmath3@xmath10 1.5@xmath410@xmath11 ergss@xmath6 ) lie in only one of the survey fields : cdfs . because the depth and seeing of the cdfs images are also superior to the other fields , we first need to verify that this field - to - field variation of the blob number density does not arise from selection effects .",
    "for example , although the separation between the fainter / smaller blob candidates and the simulated point - sources is distinct in the cdfs , the separations in other three fields are less clear .    to confirm that the field - to - field variation of the blob population is not due to the different seeing and survey depth , we simulate how the blob candidates in the cdfs field would look if observed in the other three fields . using the continuum - subtracted postage stamp ( 27@xmath427 ) images of the cdfs blob candidates , we first degrade their seeing to that of the cdfn , cosmos1 , and cosmos2 fields by convolving kernels derived from psf images .",
    "we rebin the images ( if pixel scale is different ) , add poisson noise , and place them into empty sky regions in the continuum - subtracted narrowband images of the other fields .",
    "we then measure the blob sizes and luminosities in the same way as described in ",
    "[ sec : sample_selection ] .",
    "we repeat this experiment @xmath8 1000 times to derive the range of recovered luminosities and sizes .",
    "we show the isophotal areas and ly@xmath0  luminosities ( @xmath7  @xmath80 ) from this recovery test as green squares in the cdfn , cosmos1 , and cosmos2 panels in figure [ fig : size_luminosity ] .",

    "however , the small number statistics of that study precluded constraining the mass of blob halos . although our current survey statistics are still not large enough to directly measure the clustering of blobs via correlation function analysis , we can use @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and a cosmological n - body simulation of @xmath26cdm universe to identify the most likely halo mass occupied by blobs .",

    "interestingly , these halo mass estimates agree with the dynamical masses , @xmath174 = @xmath175@xmath20@xmath21 , derived from the width of ly@xmath0lines in similar blobs @xcite . however , special caution is required in using the ly@xmath0  line width as a mass proxy , because the radiative transfer effects on the line width are poorly understood .    for the entire blob sample ( with counts of 14 , 5 , 3 , 1 for the four survey fields ) ,",
    "the required halo mass for @xmath136 = 100% is @xmath135 = 0.8@xmath410@xmath147@xmath21 .",
    "the fractional variance is @xmath176 , again consistent with the observed value .",
    "because the halo mass function is steep at the high mass end , @xmath135 for the entire sample is similar to that derived for the bright / large blobs alone .",
    "therefore , the resulting halo mass is insensitive to the blob selection cuts , and the statistics for our entire sample are consistent with blobs occupying halos of @xmath8 10@xmath147@xmath21 .",
    "halos of @xmath8 10@xmath147@xmath21 lie in the high mass tail of the halo mass distribution at @xmath129 .",
    "how massive will these halos be today ? because our simulations were not run beyond @xmath177 , we consider the n - body simulation of @xcite , which extends to @xmath178 .",
    "their @xmath19 @xmath10 @xmath20 @xmath179 halos grow in mass by 210@xmath4 ( with an average factor of @xmath180 increase ) from @xmath18 to now .",
    "therefore , it is likely that blobs are sites for the formation of the brightest galaxies in what will become the typical halos of rich clusters ( @xmath19 @xmath8 10@xmath22@xmath21 ) at the present epoch .",
    "the clustering of ly@xmath0  blobs in the cdfs and the inferred large mass of their individual halos imply that blobs inhabit overdense regions . here",
    "we test this hypothesis using the much larger population of _ compact _",
    "ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) in the cdfs to trace large - scale structure over tens of comoving mpc and thus characterize the blob environment independently .",
    "@xcite show that their blobs lie near the intersection of large - scale filamentary structures in the ssa22 overdensity .",
    "@xcite use the surface number density of laes to show that a giant blob , originally identified via its strong mir emission @xcite , resides in a region @xmath181 more dense than the edge of their survey field .",
    "we apply counts - in - cell methodology to the lae spatial distribution in the cdfs to quantify the scale over which any structure is coherent .",
    "we then identify over - densities of laes relative to their average number density in the field and compare them to the spatial distribution of blobs .",
    "we select a sample of laes in the cdfs ( @xmath95 @xmath8 200 with _",
    "nb _ @xmath62 25.0 , excluding the blobs ) following the first step in our blob selection procedure (  [ sec : sample_selection ] ) , but using a 2-diameter aperture to maximize the s / n of fainter point sources . in table",
    "[ tab : narrowband ] , we list the 5@xmath41 limiting magnitudes , which are determined by measuring fluxes within the randomly placed apertures in the sky background region .    using this lae catalog",

    "we repeat this test with different cell sizes ranging from 1  to 8 . the counts - in - cells ( c - in - c ) distributions deviate significantly ( at @xmath182 confidence ) from poisson noise for cells larger than 5 , indicating coherent large - scale structure over scales of at least @xmath8 8 comoving mpc .    figure [ fig : surface_density ] shows the lae distribution in the cdfs field . to estimate the overdensity of laes",
    ", we overlay the surface overdensity @xmath183 contours on the map . here",

    "the overdensity maps are smoothed using the adaptive kernel smoothing method developed by @xcite .",
    "the fwhms of the gaussian filters adopted by this algorithm ranges from 2.8  to 5.2depending on the local surface density of laes within in the field .",
    "we identify a belt - like large - scale structure elongated from north to south .",
    "the blob candidates are preferentially located within or at the boundary of this structure .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ly@xmath0blobs in the cdfs indeed trace overdensities in the early universe .",
    "recently , @xcite systematically searched for galaxy overdensities within the goods - south field up to @xmath185 using photometric redshifts that have a rms accuracy of @xmath186/(@xmath187 ) = 0.03 . in figure",
    "[ fig : surface_density ] , we show their three overdensities ( crosses ) with redshifts similar to our survey ( @xmath188 @xmath69 2.232.28 ) . while the goods - south field does not include the densest part of our surface density map , their overdensities each include 1923 members and are located near the boundary of the lae overdensity .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of this system is required to relate these systems with the structures revealed by our ly@xmath0  blobs and emitters .",
    "further studies are required to establish that the cdfs overdensity and similar overdensities observed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are in fact `` proto - clusters . '' for now , we note that structure in the cdfs at @xmath18 is coherent over at least 8 comoving mpc and is likely to contain tens of @xmath8 10@xmath147@xmath21 blob halos , or at least @xmath8 10@xmath22@xmath21 worth of mass . were this overdensity to grow typically and virialize by @xmath178 , then its halo mass today would be like that of the rich coma cluster , i.e. , @xmath8 10@xmath189@xmath21 .",
    "to understand what ly@xmath0  blobs will become in the present - day universe requires that we first constrain their number density , clustering , and large - scale environment . in order to obtain unbiased measures of these quantities",
    ", we target four @xmath830@xmath430fields , chandra deep field south ( cdfs ; * ? ? ? * ) , chandra deep field north ( cdfn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and two cosmos @xcite subfields , with the noao mayall and blanco-4 m telescopes and a custom narrowband filter designed for ly@xmath0at @xmath190 . the total area covered by our survey is 1.2deg@xmath1 .",
    "our sensitivity and selection criteria are comparable to that of the largest previous blob survey @xcite .",
    "we discover 25 ly@xmath0  blobs with ly@xmath0  luminosities of @xmath3= 0.78 @xmath4 @xmath5 ergss@xmath6  and isophotal areas of @xmath7 = 1060 .",
    "the transition from compact ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ; @xmath7 @xmath8a few ) to the extended ly@xmath0  blobs ( @xmath7 @xmath9 10 ) is continuous , suggesting that these two types of sources are not distinct and that whatever mechanism or mechanisms power ly@xmath0blobs work over a wide range of luminosity and spatial extent .",

    "the predicted variance in @xmath13 is consistent with that observed and corresponds to a bias of 7 .",
    "lower detectability fractions ( e.g. , @xmath8 10% ) require somewhat lower halo masses ( @xmath8 @xmath165@xmath21 ) to reproduce @xmath13 , but the resulting variance is lower and further from the observed value .",
    "blob halos lie at the high end of the halo mass distribution at @xmath18 and are likely to evolve into the @xmath810@xmath22 @xmath21 halos typical of galaxy clusters today .",
    "the clustering and inferred halo mass of blobs suggest that they lie in overdense environments .",
    "the spatial distribution of laes confirms this hypothesis : a counts - in - cells analysis of the cdfs reveals coherent large - scale structure over scales of at least @xmath8 8 comoving mpc where both the laes and blobs cluster .",
    "given the strong field - to - field variance of ly@xmath0  blobs , one must be cautious in comparing blob number densities and luminosity functions among different surveys .",
