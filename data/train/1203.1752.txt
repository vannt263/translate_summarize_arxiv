    "materials presenting magneto - electric coupling exhibit magnetic properties coupled to the electric properties , such as polarization or dielectric constant .",
    "these materials have attracted a lot of attention over the last years since the magneto - electric coupling allows a possible control of the magnetic properties by an electric field and over electric properties using a magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , the microscopic origin of the coupling between the magnetic and electric order parameters is still ill known .",
    "the knowledge of phonons spectra can however bring help on understanding this coupling .",
    "indeed , not only the phonons modes are strongly related to the existence and amplitude of a spontaneous polarization , but in addition strong spin - phonons coupling occur in multiferroic material .",
    "this coupling can even be strong enough in order to result in hybrid excitations built from the mixing between phonons and spin - waves  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such hybrid modes , called electromagnons , were recently discovered in @xmath2 orthorhombic manganites  @xcite using optical measurements .",
    "more recently such excitations were also found by inelastic neutrons scattering in the hexagonal manganite @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "hexagonal @xmath0 is a layered compound where the manganese ions are located in triangle - based bipyramids .",
    "these bipyramids are arranged in planes parallel to the @xmath4 direction so that the manganese ions form a distorted triangular lattice ( see figure  [ fig : struc ] ) .",
    "they share an oxygen atom in the @xmath4 planes . the yttrium atom is located in between the bipyramids layers .",
    "( a )    ( b )    @xmath0 is paraelectric at high temperature with space group @xmath5 . under a critical temperature",
    "it is ferroelectric , with space group @xmath1  ; the polarization is aligned along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the temperature of this paraelectric ( pe ) to ferroelectric ( fe ) phase transition is however still under debate .",
    "indeed , usually assumed to be around @xmath7  @xcite , it was recently proposed to occur at a higher temperature , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "a very recent neutrons diffraction investigation  @xcite suggests the existence of an iso - symmetric phase transition at @xmath9 , resulting in a strong lowering of the polarization amplitude , while the non - centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric transition occurs at @xmath10 only . at much lower temperature",
    "( @xmath11 ) @xmath0 undergoes a paramagnetic ( pm ) to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition .",
    "the @xmath12 ions are in a high spin state @xmath13 .",
    "neutrons diffraction experiments witness an in - plane spins orientation associated with a @xmath14 ordering , with the spins perpendicular to the mn  o bonds  @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order parameters are coupled and a giant atomic motion was revealed at the nel temperature  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic transition is however an iso - structural transition and the space group remains @xmath1 in the afm phase  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic space group is more subject to caution . indeed , while most authors favor an identical @xmath1 magnetic and structural space group  @xcite , the absence of a linear magneto - electric coupling and the existence of a ferromagnetic component recently observed  @xcite are incompatible with the @xmath1 magnetic group .",
    "group analysis shows that these experimental data can only be accounted for in the @xmath15 magnetic group  @xcite .",
    "phonons spectra are often used to help understanding both the ferroelectric / paraelectric transitions and the magneto - electric coupling . while the @xmath0 phonons spectrum has been experimentally studied both by raman  @xcite and infra - red  @xcite measurements ,",
    "there is still many opened questions concerning not only modes assignations but also the fact that several of the symmetry allowed modes are not experimentally observed .",
    "first principle calculations not only could help understanding the experimental observation but also could yield more light on the recently observed electromagnon  @xcite .",
    "the present paper thus presents first principle calculations of the @xmath3 phonons spectrum in the different space groups associated with the fe and pe phases , that is @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the methodological details and preliminary results ( geometry optimization , born effective charges , polarization , dielectric tensor , etc ... ) and section iii will describe and discuss phonons results .",
    "we performed geometry optimization , spontaneous polarization and phonons frequencies calculations within the density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the crystal09 package  @xcite .",
    "since the manganese 3d shells are strongly correlated we used hybrid functionals in order to better take into account the self - interaction cancellation .",
    "three different functionals were used in this work , namely the classical b3lyp functional  @xcite , the recently developed b1wc",
    "@xcite functional for ferroelectric systems and a b1pw  @xcite functional corresponding to the b1wc one with the perdew - wang exchange functional  @xcite .",
    "only the b1pw results are presented in the paper , the results obtained with the other functionals can be found in the supplementary data .",
    "small core pseudo - potentials were used for the heavy atoms ( mn and y ) associated with semi - valence and valence @xmath17 and @xmath17 plus polarization basis sets  @xcite .",
    "the oxygen ions are represented in an all - electrons basis set of @xmath17 quality specifically optimized for @xmath18 ions  @xcite .",
    "the mono - determinantal character of the kohn - sham approximation does not allow the possibility to deal with magnetic frustration as observed in @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , only collinear magnetism is possible in the crystal code .",
    "a non - magnetic electronic density can be calculated , however it does not account for the open - shell and high spin character of the @xmath12 ions , which are responsible for a large stabilization energy ( of the order of two hubbard @xmath19-shell @xmath20 per mn atom , this is of the order of 10ev ) and crucial for a reasonable electronic structure representation .",
    "a `` _ pseudo _ '' antiferromagnetic configuration can be proposed on a @xmath21 cell . in this case , only two among the three antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings are satisfied within each triangle .",
    "it results in a lower energy for the antiferromagnetic bonds and an associated loss of symmetry .",
    "when the geometry optimization is performed , the mn - mn distances associated with anti - aligned spins are shorter than the bonds with aligned spins , resulting in a structure with unphysical symmetry and characteristics .",
    "the choice of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) configuration for the @xmath12 s=2 spins thus seems the best compromise .",
    "indeed , not only this configuration respects the system symmetry ( a crucial aspect for accurate phonons modes ) , but also the energy error that can be associated with the loss of the inter - atomic exchange energy ( that is @xmath22 per bond ) is much weaker than the error associated with the loss of the magnetic character for the @xmath12 ions . for these reasons all our calculations will be done within a ferromagnetic mn spins alignment .    within this procedure , we computed the polarization ( using berry phase approach ) for the different experimental geometries available in the literature at different temperatures .",
    "table  [ t : pol ] reports the computed polarization values .",
    "one sees immediately that our computed values are in very good agreement with the experimental ones , despite the fact that the magnetic order used in the calculation is ferromagnetic and not antiferromagnetic .",
    "the quality of these results thus validate our choices for the calculations .",
    "in addition it supports the idea , first proposed by lee _",
    "@xcite , that in this system the magneto - electric coupling is mainly driven by elastic effects rather than by a direct coupling between the polarization and the magnetic order .",
    ".spontaneous polarization @xmath23 in @xmath24 for different temperatures .",
    "experimental and computed values using the experimental geometries at the given temperatures . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this phonon mode , active neither in infra - red nor in raman experiments exhibits displacements that can be expected to strongly affect the magnetic exchange coupling constants along the red , dashed and magenta , dotted bonds as picture in figure  [ fig : a2 ] .    let us notice that the effective exchange @xmath25 between two manganese atoms is the sum of a direct exchange contribution @xmath26 ( pauli exchange , always ferromagnetic , exponentially dependent on the mn - mn distance ) and a through - ligand super - exchange term @xmath27 ( antiferromagnetic , dependent on the metal ligand distances and on the mn - o - mn angles ) . in @xmath0",
    "the magnetic exchange couplings are known to be antiferromagnetic showing that the through - ligand super - exchange term @xmath27 dominates over the direct exchange contribution @xmath26 .",
    "we analyzed this super - exchange term and reported in figure  [ fig : coupl ] the main super - exchange paths .",
    "@xmath27 thus scales as the sum of the four associated super - exchange terms , each of them scaling as the square of the product of the associated @xmath28 orbital overlap and the @xmath29 orbital overlap .",
    "( @xmath30 ) + ( @xmath31 )    ( @xmath32 ) + ( @xmath33 )    the @xmath34 phonon mode under consideration involves the following atomic displacements on the red , dashed and magenta , dotted mn triangles ( see figure  [ fig : a2 ] ) .",
    "* the mn - mn bond length elongation / contraction ( in opposite phases between red and magenta triangles ) . this movement affects the direct part of the exchange  : @xmath26 , increasing its ferromagnetic character when the mn - mn distances are contracted and decreasing it when the mn - mn distances are elongated . * the up and down movement ( along the @xmath35 direction ) of the oxygens atoms at the center of these triangles .",
    "this movement strongly affects both the mn - o distances , reducing them when the oxygens come closer to the mn plane , and the mn - o - mn angle .",
    "one sees immediately using figure  [ fig : coupl ] that , when the oxygen comes closer to the mn plane , the overlap between the magnetic orbitals of the mn atoms and the @xmath36 bridging orbitals of the central oxygen increases , thus increasing the antiferromagnetic character of @xmath27 . at the same time",
    "the mn - mn bond length increases thus decreasing the ferromagnetic character of @xmath26 .",
    "both terms goes in the same direction resulting in a enlarged antiferromagnetic character for the bonds of the ( alternatively red / magenta ) triangles when the central oxygen comes closer to the mn plane and a reduced antiferromagnetic character when the central oxygen goes away from the mn plane . the blue , solid line , mn triangles ( centered around the unit cell origin ) are subject to a rotation _ as a whole _ around the @xmath6 axis going through their central oxygen ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "one thus does not expect the magnetic exchange within the blue mn triangles to be affected by this @xmath34 phonon mode .",
    "however this rotation results in a strong distortion of the triangles with blue red and magenta bond inducing a magnetic interaction scheme quite far from the nearly homogeneous triangular lattice of the static structure .",
    "the main conclusion of this analysis is that this @xmath34 phonon mode is strongly coupled to the magnetic interactions .",
    "let us now put these results into perspective with the characteristics of the hybrid phonon - magnon excitation , studied using inelastic polarized and non - polarized neutron scattering by pailhs and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "one notices that this @xmath34 mode seems to fulfill all the requirements for a good candidate for the phonon participating to the hybrid mode .",
    "indeed , it is an optical mode in the adequate energy range , exhibiting atomic displacements consistent with the umbrella motion proposed in reference   and that can be expected from the above analysis to be strongly coupled to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the present paper proposes @xmath38 point phonon calculations for the @xmath3 compound both in the ferroelectric phase and in the paraelectric phase .",
    "our calculations agrees well with the infra - red and raman experimental data . the experimental versus calculated modes correspondence is discussed in details for the few problematic modes .",
    "we were able to explain the fact that several modes could not be seen in ir experiments due to their very low ( calculated ) intensities .",
    "a careful analysis of the phonons modes correspondence , when going from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase , is performed and leads to the conclusion that , the phonon modes observed in raman scattering at 1200k  @xcite can not be associated with the paraelectric phase @xmath16 space group .",
    "the different intermediate subgroups allowed between the paraelectric @xmath16 space group and the ferroelectric @xmath1 group were also checked against the modes continuity and the experimental data and had to be discarded . the only possibility agreeing with the phonon calculations and",
    "the experimental data is that the @xmath16 to @xmath39 phase transition occurs at a temperature higher than 1200k , supporting the proposition of jeong  @xcite and gibbs  @xcite ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "finally we studied in more details the first optical mode .",
    "this mode belongs to @xmath34 irreducible representation and is inactive both in ir and raman experiment .",
    "this mode however seems to have all necessary characteristics to be a good candidate for the phonon part of the electro - magnon mode observed in inelastic neutrons scattering by petit , pailhs _ et al _  @xcite .",
