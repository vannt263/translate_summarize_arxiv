    "quantized vorticity being a key feature of superfluidity , vortex dynamics and configurations have long been central topics in the study of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in the context of trapped atomic becs , vortex dynamics",
    "has enjoyed a resurgence of interest because of new physical effects associated with the trap geometry .",
    "vortices have been produced in becs by transferring angular momentum either by manipulation of the quantum phase and the hyperfine state of the atoms @xcite or directly by mechanical means @xcite .",
    "the majority of subsequent experiments have focused on externally rotated condensates , where vortices of the same circulation sign arrange into vortex lattices @xcite . on the other hand , in becs without external rotation , one can have vortices of both circulation signs coexisting . in a trap , such combinations display fundamentally new effects , such as stationary structures found in theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "for example , in pancake - shaped becs , a stable linear configuration exists for vortex tripoles if the interaction is large enough @xcite .",
    "this linear arrangement contains an anti - vortex at the trap center and two vortices equally spaced on either side of the anti - vortex .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report experimental evidence for the stability of specific three - vortex configurations in a trapped bec .",
    "we create three - vortex states through an external oscillatory perturbation in a @xmath0 bec held in a cigar - shaped magnetic trap .",
    "our analysis of the three - vortex configurations indicate the existence of stable linear structures . we interpret these as the vortex tripole structures of refs .",
    "@xcite described above .",
    "we also find structures where the three vortices form an approximately equilateral triangle .",
    "we interpret these as three vortices with the same circulation .    in the absence of extensive experimental results on few - vortex dynamics and configurations in non - rotating trapped becs , our results open up an intriguing direction of vortex studies . by realizing the linear configuration in a cylindrical geometry ,",
    "we demonstrate that the phenomenon of stationary vortex cluster configurations is robust well beyond the two - dimensional ( 2d ) or pancake limit .",
    "in addition , the study of the dynamics and coexistence of vortices and anti - vortices is an essential ingredient for understanding evolution to turbulence as well as decay processes .",
    "more generally , interest in the interplay between vortex dynamics and confinement effects extends beyond cold - atom physics , since analogous issues with magnetic vortex / anti - vortex effects in ferromagnetic microstructures have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup and the vortex excitation procedure are described in detail elsewhere @xcite . briefly",
    ", we use a @xmath0 bec with @xmath1 atoms held in a cigar shaped magnetic trap with frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 hz .",
    "vortices are generated by applying on the bec an oscillating quadrupolar magnetic field whose amplitude is much smaller than the trap fields . as a function of field amplitude we observe an increasing number of vortices formed , up to the limit where a vortex tangle is observed @xcite .",
    "for this study , we focus on images where a clear 3-vortex configuration is observed within the condensate core .",
    "therefore , we have restricted the amplitude and frequency of the excitation for generating only this kind of structure .",
    "the excitation time was fixed at 20  ms , followed by an equilibrating time of 20  ms before releasing the atoms for free expansion .",
    "this is important because different excitation times can lead to different physical situations .",
    "vortices are produced while the bec is still held in the trap . for our analysis",
    "we will assume that the in - trap structure is maintained during the 15  ms of time - of - flight .",
    "in fact , this is a widely used assumption in experimental vortex studies .",
    "of course , it is possible that in some of the images two of the density dips might be the two ends of a single vortex line , rather than two distinct vortices .",
    "this situation may introduce  false counts \" in our statistics and is a limitation of our procedure for detecting and counting vortices .",
    "we observe predominantly two types of configurations .",
    "the vortices are either distributed as a near - equilateral triangle , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : three](a ) , or as a near - linear array , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : three](b ) .",
    "we analyze the geometrical distribution by recording the largest internal angle , @xmath4 , of the triangle whose vertices are the vortex positions , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a ) .",
    "the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] summarizes our results of more than 60 independent measurements , showing the relative frequencies of observed values of @xmath4 .",
    "two types of stable configurations have a clear prominence over the others , namely , an equilateral triangle type where the angle @xmath4 is around @xmath5 , and a linear array where @xmath6 .        .",
    "( b ) schematics of the tripole configuration of vortices , arrows indicate the vortex circulation direction . ]",
    "it is important to point out that , for the present conditions of the excitation , vortices are mainly nucleated along the radial direction of the condensate , perpendicular to the long axis of the cloud . for the case of the linear array ,",
    "the orientation of the cluster is preferentially aligned with the long axis of the condensate .",
    "we will interpret our data using considerations of a quasi-2d ( pancake - shaped ) geometry . while this is a crude approximation to our condensate geometry , going beyond this approach",
    "is difficult because results on few - vortex dynamics in our geometry are rare .    in the inset of figure [ fig : angle ] , we show the expected distribution of the largest angle @xmath4 when the three vortices are distributed at random positions within the magnetically trapped bec core , taken to be an ellipse with aspect ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the intermediate @xmath8 $ ] arrangement would be expected to be almost as numerous as the equilateral - like @xmath9 $ ] arrangement .",
    "to explain the fact that we get much fewer intermediate configurations , we consider the _ dynamics _ of three vortices with the same circulation",
    ". for simplicity , our discussion and the simulations of figure [ fig : simulations ] use a circular trap , but this is sufficient for the present discussion .",
    "three vortices placed symmetrically around the trap center ( @xmath10 ) in a nonrotating condensate simply precess around the center , maintaining the equilateral configuration . if the initial configuration is moderately distorted from this symmetric configuration , the dynamics of the triangle shape is also moderate , so that @xmath4 does not vary too much .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the configurations starting with @xmath9 $ ] stays within this range during the precession dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]a , b ) .    .",
    "the inset shows the expected distribution of @xmath4 when the vortices are distributed at random positions . ]",
    "however , when the initially created vortex positions are such that @xmath8 $ ] , the triangle formed by their positions changes shape as the vortices precess , so that the oscillations of @xmath4 takes it in and out of the @xmath9 $ ] range ( _ e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]c ) .",
    "thus the preponderance of near - equilateral configurations in our experiment reflects the fact that there are many @xmath9 $ ] configurations which are ` stable ' in the sense of maintaining the triangle shape while precessing .",
    "clearly , the experimental data should be thought of as corresponding to random times in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations ] .    while the equilateral arrangement is reminiscent of the abrikosov lattice observed by many authors @xcite , and of the three - vortex case studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and , our measurements explore the rather different physics of non - rotating condensates . in an abrikosov lattice ,",
    "the equilateral triangle does not distort and stays stationary in the cororating frame , and the vortices do not undergo mutual rotations and independent precession - dynamics , as in the present case .",
    "our results reveal that the equilateral arrangement also plays a special role in the situation without external rotation , through maintaining its shape during precession .    from similar arguments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]d ) , if all vortices have the same circulation direction , we would expect a smaller frequency of near - linear configurations with @xmath11 $ ] , compared to the random - distribution case of figure [ fig : angle ] inset . in our experimental data , however , the linear array is more frequent than the random - distribution prediction .",
    "this indicates that in the linear configurations the vortex circulations are not all of the same sign .    , in gross - pitaevskii simulations starting from various three - vortex configurations in a circularly trapped two - dimensional bec .",
    "initial configurations are shown on right . ]",
    "@xcite have shown that a tripole configuration like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](b ) can be a stable configuration . for a pancake - shaped condensate ,",
    "the vortex tripole is metastable when the interaction strength is above a certain value @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "the interaction strength is expressed by the effective 2d coupling parameter @xmath12 , defined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the scattering length , @xmath15 is the number of particles , and @xmath16 is the oscillator length in the direction perpendicular to the plane considered to be quasi-2d . following ref .",
    "@xcite the condition for the tripole configuration to be stable is @xmath17 . in our experimental geometry ,",
    "the perpendicular direction is one of the radial directions , @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 .",
    "thus , from quasi-2d arguments , we expect the linear tripole to be metastable in our setup , which supports our interpretation that the predominance of linear configurations is due to the tripole of refs .",
    "the fact that our setup is not really quasi-2d indicates that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are valid well beyond the pancake - shape limit .",
    "it is expected @xcite that the tripole survives for a time of the order of @xmath20 , which for our case is about 10  ms , well within the 20  ms of waiting time before releasing the atoms from the magnetic potential .",
    "thus tripole decay has a chance to reduce the number of observations of tripole configurations , as discussed further below .",
    "in fact , 20  ms of waiting time seems to be the best time to clearly observe the vortices within the cloud and , for this reason , it has been chosen in our experiment . for a very long waiting time after excitation , observation of collinear 3-vortex configurations seems to be scarcer but fluctuations do not allow us to be more quantitative in this regard .    the experimental method used here to produce vortex states has basically the same probability to produce both circulation sign vortices .",
    "such equal chances come from the fact that the oscillatory field introduced by the extra coils modulates the equilibrium position as well as the overall trap shape introducing features that result in a vortex state of both circulation signs , as discussed in ref .",
    "the equal chances for vortex and anti - vortex formation implies that in many of the observed distributions a collection of two vortices and one anti - vortex can occur .",
    "since such a combination has a metastable linear structure , this would explain the prominence of near - linear structures in figure [ fig : angle ] .",
    "we now provide back - of - the - envelope estimates for the relative abundance of the near - equilateral and near - linear configurations .",
    "if vortex and anti - vortex production are equally likely , we would expect that the probability @xmath21 to excite a mixture containing one vortex with circulation opposite to the other two would be higher than the probability @xmath22 to produce three vortices with the same sign .",
    "considering the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 . assuming the production of a sequence of vortices to be independent events , we would have the probability of having three vortices of the same sign as 0.25 while for having one of opposite sign among them as 0.75 . that would produce a ratio @xmath25 and not @xmath26 as observed in our experiment .",
    "this mismatch is probably due to the complex dynamics occurring after vortex nucleation .",
    "vortex tripoles have more decay mechanisms , such as a vortex / anti - vortex pair annihilation or through one vortex migrating to the borders of the condensate generating surface modes , and leaving behind a vortex dipole @xcite .",
    "the latter process is known to happen at time scales @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "considering an exponential decay for the tripole configurations , with time constant @xmath28 ms , we get for our waiting time of 20 ms a reduction by a factor of @xmath29 . taking all this into account ,",
    "if a configuration with three vortices is initially produced , the probability of observing the triangle remains as 0.25 , the probability of observing a tripole is 0.10 and the probability of observing a dipole is 0.65 .",
    "considering only three - vortex observations , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is much closer to the observed values in our experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] reflects greater stability of the same - circulation situation compared to the vortex / anti - vortex / vortex configuration .",
    "in summary , we have observed 3-vortex cluster configurations where two different types are the most frequent : the equilateral triangle geometry and the linear array .",
    "we have argued that the triangular cluster type is formed predomniantly by vortices with the same sign of circulation while the linear array is numerous because of configurations where the middle vortex has opposite sign .    the present experiments are loosely related to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite where different vortex configurations were created by merging multiple becs . almost linear or triangle structures can also be seen in their data .",
    "our results complement those of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a quite different vortex formation mechanism .",
    "more recently , the same group has produced vortex dipoles in a non - rotating superfluid by forcing a quasi-2d bec to flow around a repulsive gaussian obstacle @xcite .",
    "vortex - antivortex dynamics in confined geometries is of broader interest than superfluid gases , since similar dynamical issues are currently under intense study in the magnetic microstructure context @xcite . within the field of cold atomic gases ,",
    "our experiment features a distinct manner for creating vortices of both circulation in the same condensate .",
    "our results highlight several poorly understood aspects of vortex physics , in particular involving non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "since the imaging is performed after the released condensates have expanded and have undergone aspect ratio inversion , there are several issues related to the expansion dynamics .",
    "it is not known in any detail whether or not the presence of vortex clusters affects the inversion dynamics , or how the vortex configurations are rearranged as the cloud undergoes anisotropic expansion .",
    "another issue raised by the current experiments is the stability of the tripole configurations in a cylindrical rather than pancake - shaped condensate , since the theoretical studies @xcite concern flat condensates .",
    "the abundance of the linear tripole configuration seen here suggests that the scissor oscillations used to excite the condensate may stabilize the tripole configuration , perhaps counteracting the dynamical instability discussed in ref .",
    ". these effects are clearly of basic interest but are yet to be theoretically analyzed in detail .",
    "in addition , investigation of the dynamics of superfluids containing both vortices and anti - vortices may be a fruitful alternative way to understand basic decay mechanisms of quantum turbulence and other poorly understood phenomena in atomic becs .",
