    "the observations of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission can be described rather well by a suitable model for the diffuse interstellar gas , gcr , and photon distributions ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "however , above 1  gev the observed average diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity , foremost in the inner galaxy , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , exceeds the model prediction significantly .",
    "as far as the energetic particles are concerned , there are at least two possible explanations for this discrepancy ( e.g. weekes et al .",
    "1997 ; hunter et al . 1997b , and references therein ) .",
    "the high - energy @xmath0-ray excess may indicate that the gcr spectrum observed in the local neighborhood is not representative of the diffuse cr population in the galactic disk .",
    "an unresolved distribution of cr sources is the other possibility . since the @xmath0-ray emission is the product of the energetic particle intensity on the one hand , and of the gas density or the photon density , on the other , it is of course possible that deviations from the above model assumptions for these latter densities across the galaxy can also lead to changes in the observed energy spectrum of the diffuse gamma rays .",
    "we shall not discuss such deviations here .",
    "we shall rather evaluate the contribution of the sources , assumed to be the ensemble of supernova remnant ( snr ) shells , following a recent calculation by berezhko & vlk ( 1999 ) .",
    "we shall also consider the transport of the particles from the same sources out of the galaxy to naturally increase with decreasing galactic radius ( breitschwerdt et al .",
    ", 1991 ) . we shall leave aside the possibility of new sources of particles , not known in the neighborhood of the solar system .",
    "since at best a handful of shell snrs could be argued to have been detected up to now in gamma rays , we shall ignore their discrete contributions and consider the cr sources to be spatially averaged over the volume @xmath3  @xmath4 of the galactic gas disk , with a radius of 10  kpc and a thickness of 240  pc .",
    "the corresponding gas mass is @xmath5 ( dickey & lockman , 1990 ) .",
    "the source input rate in the form of energetic particle energy equals @xmath6 , where we take @xmath7 , @xmath8 erg .",
    "the efficiency per snr is @xmath9 .",
    "the total number of localized snrs which still contain their shock accelerated crs , called here the source crs ( scrs ) , is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is their assumed life time , i.e. the time until which they can confine the accelerated particles in their interior .",
    "thus @xmath12 is dominated by the population of old snrs .",
    "we estimate @xmath13 yr . after the time @xmath11 the scrs rather quickly become part of the ordinary gcrs that presumably occupy a large galactic residence volume uniformly .",
    "we assume the overall scr number inside a single snr to be given by a power law spectrum @xmath14 in energy @xmath15 in the relativistic range .",
    "averaged over the disk volume , the spatial density @xmath16 of scrs is given @xmath17 , with energy density @xmath18 . in terms of @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the same expressions hold for the gcrs , given @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    for the scr we may quite possibly have @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximum scr energy .",
    "the @xmath28-decay prodution rate is given by @xmath29 ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) , which leads to the ratio @xmath30 of the @xmath0-ray production rates due to scrs and gcrs , given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ratio @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the mean source gas density , and @xmath35 denotes the average gas density in the disk .    with @xmath36 , @xmath37  erg/@xmath4 for the relativistic part of the gcrs , and @xmath38 which results in @xmath39 ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) , we obtain @xmath40 for @xmath25 .    the total @xmath0-ray spectrum measured from an arbitrary galactic disk volume is then expected to be @xmath41,\\ ] ] where the additional factor 0.4 is introduced to approximately take into account the contribution of gcr electron component to the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission at gev energies , and where @xmath42 is taken from the paper by ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "we can derive very similar results from a leaky box - type balance equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the energy - dependent residence volume occupied by gcrs that reach the gas disk during their constant mean residence time @xmath45  yrs in @xmath44 . in the case of an extended galactic halo , @xmath46 ( ptuskin et al .",
    "1997 ) . using eq .",
    "( 4 ) we can write @xmath47 the gcr residence time in the disk volume @xmath48 can be derived from the measured grammage @xmath49  g/@xmath50 , for @xmath51 gev , and @xmath52  g/@xmath50 , for @xmath53 gev ( engelman et al .",
    "1990 ) .    at relativistic energies",
    "@xmath54 , the gcr spectrum and the overall scr spectrum @xmath55 are connected by the relation @xmath56 taking @xmath57 , which leads to @xmath58 ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) , we obtain for @xmath59  gev : @xmath60 ( berezhko & vlk , 1999 ) .    the question is , of course , whether the sn confinement time @xmath11 is time dependent .",
    "probably this dependence is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the sweep - up time when the snr enters the sedov phase and the shock speed begins to decrease with time . for average ism parameters",
    "@xmath63 yr .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the measurements by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and our two estimates for the total @xmath0-ray emission , from gcrs plus scrs .",
    "they demonstrate that the scr contribution for the acceleration model exceeds the leaky box values for all energies .",
    "the reason is that for our empirical model the acceleration efficiency for the relativistic part of the spectrum is only @xmath64 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the mean injection efficiency at the snr shock is lower than the values typically assumed for a parallel shock by a factor of a few .",
    "we take the lower value for the @xmath0-ray emission in fig.1 as the most reliable estimate for the expected diffuse @xmath0-ray emission , including the scrs .",
    "nevertheless the scr distribution , which is about 10 percent at gev energies , becomes dominant beyond 100 gev , and exceeds the gcr emission at 1 tev by almost a factor of 10 .",
    "it would be very interesting to detect the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission at 1 tev in order to test this prediction .    until now we have only discussed the @xmath0-ray emission from hadronic scrs .",
    "in fact , there are many reasons to assume that electrons are equally well accelerated in snrs , even if their injection into the shock acceleration process is much less well understood",
    ". the inverse compton emission by scr electrons can be comparable with the hadronic emission , even though it does not contribute at tev energies . for a more detailed discussion",
    "we refer to the paper of berezhko & vlk ( 1999 ) .",
    "the models used to fit the @xmath0-ray data from , say , egret assume a gcr energy spectrum that is uniform throughout the galaxy .",
    "this tacitly assumes that the gcr transport properties leading to the escape from the galaxy are everywhere the same .",
    "however that needs not be the case , and in fact is almost certainly not true .",
    "the dynamical processes leading to gcr escape depend on the strength of the regular magnetic field and on its fluctuation characteristics , as well as on the cr pressure , and the gravitational field .",
    "an example is the formation of parker bubbles which remove the enclosed crs through their boyant rise into the halo and ultimately into the intergalactic medium .",
    "another example which we wish to discuss here in some more detail , involves the galactic wind which is partly driven by the gcrs themselves ( e.g. breitschwerdt et al . , 1991 , 1993 ;",
    "zirakashvili et al . ,",
    "in fact , the wind velocity perpendicular to the disk - in z - direction - is much larger in the central regions of the galaxy than at larger radii , through the radial variation of the galactic gravitational field alone ( see fig .",
    "this implies that for a given particle energy the boundary seperating the dominantly diffusive transport perpendicular to the galactic disk near the disk from the dominantly convective transport at greater halo heights _ moves down _ in direction to the galactic midplane in the inner galaxy . since the gcr diffusion coefficient increases with energy ,",
    "the position of this boundary will depend on energy . as shown by ptuskin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the energy spectrum of the gcrs is typically @xmath65 in the convection region compared to the standard spectrum @xmath66 in the diffusive confinement region of volume @xmath67 discussed in subsecion 2.1 .",
    "a line of site that intersects this boundary will therefore receive gamma rays   from two regions of very different gcr energy spectra , emitting correspondingly harder spectra than does the diffusive confinement region alone .",
    "qualitatively this implies a hardening of the truly diffuse @xmath0-ray spectrum with galactic longitude towards the inner galaxy , for given latitude .",
    "however , the effect will disappear for high enough energies when the convective zone does no more extend into regions of significant gas density .    thus , in contrast to the contribution of the sources , this transport effect looses importance at high energies .    it remains to work out this effect quantitatively .",
    "but its very existence illustrates the interest we should attach to the measurements of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission over an as wide as possible range of energies .",
    "the foregoing discussion shows that there are at least two mechanisms of basic physical interest that contribute to a deviation of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission spectrum from what would be expected from cr observations in the solar vicinity .",
    "the contribution from the scrs is an inevitable one and is essentially sufficient to explain the data at least for the inner galaxy ; it should be part of the @xmath0-ray emission model to begin with .",
    "clearly this does not rule out effects from potentially existing new populations of crs , especially electrons , or the influence of an increased strength , for instance , of the interstellar radiation field .",
    "this is particularly true for high galactic latitudes .",
    "* acknowledgements * the work on the role of the cr sources , summarized in the first part of the paper , has been done jointly with e.g. berezhhko .",
