    "changes of the vector meson properties in strongly interacting matter at finite baryon density and temperature are presently of great interest , both theoretically and experimentally . in particular , the current heavy - ion experiments with the detector hades @xcite at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis18 ( gsi , darmstadt ) are mainly aimed at measuring in - medium modifications of light vector meson via the @xmath6 decay channel with high accuracy .",
    "one of the primary goals of the future experiments planned at sis100/200 is also to study very dense baryon matter and the expected strong changes of the in - medium hadrons .",
    "it is widely believed that the in - medium spectral change of the light mesons is related to the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and baryon density .",
    "there are indeed various theoretical indications concerning an important sensitivity of the meson spectral density on the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in a hot / dense nuclear medium .",
    "for instance , at finite temperature the vector and axial - vector meson correlators become mixed in accordance with in - medium weinberg sum rules @xcite .",
    "such a mixing causes an increasing degeneracy of vector and axial - vector spectral functions which would manifest themselves as a decrease of the @xmath0 and @xmath7 meson mass splitting .",
    "similarly , the degeneracy of scalar ( @xmath8 channel ) and pseudo - scalar ( @xmath9 channel ) correlators found in lattice qcd @xcite can lead to a considerable enhancement of the @xmath8 meson spectral function at finite temperature and density @xcite .    in spite of substantial efforts undertaken to understand the nature of vector mesons in a dense medium",
    "there is so far no unique and widely accepted quantitative picture of their in - medium behavior .",
    "the brown and rho conjecture @xcite on the direct interlocking of vector meson masses and chiral quark condensate @xmath10 supplemented by the `` vector manifestation '' of chiral symmetry in medium @xcite predict a strong and quantitatively the same decrease of the in - medium @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses .    at the same time , model calculations based on various effective lagrangians ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) predict rather moderate and different mass shifts for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in a dense medium . in order `` to match '' both sets of predictions one",
    "has to go beyond simplifications made in the above mentioned approaches : the in - medium vector meson modification is governed not only by @xmath11 but also by condensates of higher order to be evaluated beyond mean - field approximation .",
    "further , effective lagrangians are dealing with the scattering amplitudes in free space , but effects related to the in - medium change of the qcd condensates should be included @xcite .",
    "the very consistent way to incorporate in - medium qcd condensates is through qcd sum rules ( qsr ) .",
    "the qsr for vector mesons in nuclear matter were first developed in @xcite , where within a simple parameterization of the spectral density in terms of a delta function at the resonance peak an agreement with the brown - rho scaling , i.e. the same dropping of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses , in nuclear matter was obtained . while the zero - width approximation for the resonance spectral density is successful in vacuum @xcite , such an approximation is not well grounded for the in - medium mesons which can undergo rather strong inelastic scatterings off the surrounding nucleons .",
    "for realistic in - medium qsr evaluations one needs to take into account the finite meson widths including collision broadening effects .",
    "the important impact of the finite width was studied , e.g. , in @xcite using a plausible ansatz for the in - medium spectral density .",
    "as shown in this qsr analysis , there is no inevitable necessity for in - medium dropping of the vector meson masses , but the global changes of mesons like mass shift and width broadening turn out to be correlated in nuclear matter . to avoid too many unknown parameters in the qsr equation and to make more definite predictions one has to specify in a detailed manner the ansatz for the hadron spectral density .",
    "as we show below such a specification for @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons can be done basing on an effective lagrangian approach which gives a realistic behavior of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering amplitudes .",
    "as well known , qsr in nuclear matter contain also an uncertainty related to the poorly known density dependence of the four - quark condensate .",
    "the majority of the qsr evaluations employs mean - field approximations for the in - medium 4-quark condensate , i.e. its density dependence is simply governed by the chiral condensate squared . at the same time , as pointed out in @xcite the in - medium mass shift of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons is dominated by the dependence of the 4-quark condensate on density . in particular , the sign of the @xmath1 meson mass shift is changed by the variation of the strength of the density dependence of the 4-quark condensate beyond mean - field approximation .",
    "this result was confirmed in @xcite , where the @xmath1 meson spectral density was constrained within a general form of the in - medium @xmath1 meson propagator including collision broadening via the imaginary part of the @xmath5 scattering amplitude delivered by an effective chiral lagrangian @xcite .    a direct observation of the @xmath1 meson spectral change via the e@xmath12 decay channel appears to be an experimental challenge in heavy - ion collisions at sis18 energies .",
    "both transport code simulations @xcite and a hydrodynamical model approach @xcite point to a considerable contribution of the reaction @xmath13 into dilepton spectra in the wanted region .",
    "a chance to separate e@xmath12 pairs from in - medium @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons crucially depends on the quantitative details of their mass shift and width broadening in nuclear matter .",
    "this gives rise to a strong request from the experimental side to find out the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson in - medium spectral changes simultaneously on a unique basis including self - consistently effects of the qcd condensates and collision broadening in nuclear matter .    in the present paper",
    "we study systematically within the borel qsr the important role of the 4-quark condensate for spectral modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in baryon matter .",
    "being still within the low - density expansion we go beyond the mean - field approximation and vary the strength of the density dependence of the 4-quark condensate . concerning the in - medium meson spectral density entering the hadronic part of the qsr evaluation we use a constraint motivated by the general structure of the vector meson propagator with finite in - medium width of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons reflecting the scattering of vector mesons off nucleons the in nuclear medium .",
    "seeking realistic @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering amplitudes we employ the results of the recent covariant unitarized coupled channel approach @xcite which satisfactorily describes the experimental pion- and photon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "we find that in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are indeed dominated by the dependence of the 4-quark condensate on density .",
    "in particular , the numerical value of a parameter , which describes the strength of the linear density dependence of the 4-quark condensate , governs the decrease of the @xmath0 meson mass as a function of density . for the @xmath1 meson the sign of the in - medium mass shift",
    "is changed by variations of this parameter .",
    "since the difference of the vector and axial - vector correlators is proportional to the 4-quark condensate the sign of the vector meson mass shift , measured via the @xmath14 channel , can serve as a tool for determining how fast nuclear matter approaches the chiral symmetry restoration with increasing baryon density .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recapitulate the necessary equations and formulate the borel qcd sum rule .",
    "the systematic evaluation of this sum rule is presented in section iii for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . as supplement",
