    "interestingly , three of our eclipsing dlas seem to follow this anti - correlation , implying that the dla gas is photoionized by a soft radiation and/or if it is close to the agn , the ionization parameter is very low ( howk & sembach 1999 ) .",
    "the remaining three eclipsing dlas indicate rather elevated aliii / siii ratios , with one dla ( towards j1154@xmath80215 ) having the highest aliii / siii ratio ( @xmath19 + 0.71 ) ever reported for a dla or pdla .    in fig .",
    "[ al3si2 ] , the thick cyan line shows the result of a grid of cloudy models constructed for the ionization parameter logu  =  0.0 and a nominal hydrogen density logn@xmath44  =  1.0 . the combination of the mean agn spectrum of mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation at @xmath11  =  2.5742 ( mean redshift of all our eclipsing dlas ) , and the haardt - madau extragalactic spectrum ( haardt & madau 1996 ) at the same redshift is taken as the incident radiation hitting the cloud .",
    "note that the mean metallicity @xmath9[si / h]@xmath1  =  @xmath81.2 is assumed although the result is not very sensitive to the choice of the metallicity and redshift . as shown in fig .",
    "[ al3si2 ] , two of our eclipsing dlas seem to have aliii / siii ratios consistent with this cloudy model .    as mentioned above , the aliii / siii ratio in the eclipsing dla towards j1154@xmath80215 is @xmath19 + 0.71 which is @xmath4  6 times more than the highest value in the berg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) dla sample ( see fig .  [ al3si2 ] ) .",

    "lower limit ; see below and fig .",
    "[ j1154_1d ] ) . to get the siii column density ,",
    "a voigt profile fit was conducted on the siii@xmath381808 and @xmath381526 absorption lines . since the former transition is weak and the latter one is slightly blended to the red , the derived @xmath42(siii ) is taken as an upper limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the aliii absorption profiles are most probably saturated as the two components seem to have almost the same optical depth . the high value of aliii / siii ratio towards j1154@xmath80215 could be explained if one assumes a two- or multi - phase medium .    in fig .",
    "[ al3si2 ] , the pink diamonds show the aliii / siii ratios in our sample as a function of the velocity offset between the dlas and their quasars . in this figure , the upper x - axis represents the velocity offsets in kms@xmath13 , and positive values indicate a redshift ( i.e. the dlas falling towards the quasar ) .",
    "taken at face value , there appears to be a strong correlation ( with the coefficient of 0.99 ) between the velocity offsets and the aliii / siii ratios among the dlas with positive velocity offset .",
    "the only exception to this is the dla towards j1253@xmath351007 which exhibits a high positive velocity offset of @xmath4  1207  kms@xmath13 , and apparently does not follow this trend .",
    "we note that the redshift of this quasar was obtained by fitting its civ emission line ( see fig .",
    "[ j1253_1d ] ) .",
    "so , if we apply the known systematic shift of civ emission line ( as reported in shen et al .",
    "2007 ) to correct the redshift , we get a velocity offset of @xmath4  290  kms@xmath13 ( instead of @xmath4  1207  kms@xmath13 ) between the dla and the quasar .",
    "this new value , which is now more consistent with the correlation mentioned above , is shown as a purple square in fig .",
    "[ al3si2 ] .",
    "note that the pink line shows the fit to the data points of dlas with positive velocity offset , after excluding the one towards j1253@xmath351007 .",
    "it could be possible that eclipsing dlas with positive velocity offset are chemically distinct from those with negative velocity offset .",
    "the dla towards j1058 + 0315 with negative velocity offset of @xmath8809  kms@xmath13 is probably an intervening gas .",
    "this correlation strongly suggests that dlas with higher velocity towards the quasars have also higher ionization and therefore may be closer to the agn which is consistent with the fact that they could be part of an infall flow onto the host galaxy .",
    "since extended ly@xmath2 emission is detected in the trough of our eclipsing dlas , this indicates that the size of the absorbing cloud should be smaller than that of the ly@xmath2 emitting central unresolved region . in paper",
    "i , we studied in detail the eclipsing dla seen towards the quasar j0823 + 0529 , which also exhibits some indications of partial coverage of the belr .",
    "we used the cloudy photo - ionization code to model the absorber including the siii@xmath40 absorption and derived hydrogen density in the range 180  @xmath9  @xmath45  @xmath9  710  @xmath46 , resulting in the cloud size in the range 2.3  @xmath9  @xmath47(hi )  @xmath9  9.1  pc .",
    "siii@xmath40 absorption is also detected in the eclipsing dla towards quasar j1253 + 1007 ( see fig .  [ j1253_1d ] ) .",
    "following the same approach as in paper  i , we get @xmath45  @xmath4  13  @xmath46 and @xmath47(hi)@xmath48  50  pc . unfortunately , in the other 4 objects in our sample , the siii@xmath40 absorption is not detected .    assuming , as in e.g. prochaska and hennawi ( 2009 ) that the optically thick eclipsing dlas in our sample have @xmath49  @xmath1  10  @xmath46",
    ", we can derive an indicative upper limit on their size ( i.e. @xmath47  @xmath4  @xmath21/@xmath45 ) .",
    "the result is given in the last column of table  [ redshifts ] where the values are in pc .",
    "as shown in this table , all our eclipsing dlas appear to have sizes smaller than 300  pc . since nelrs in quasars have dimensions of several hundreds of parsecs , our upper limits on the size of the eclipsing dlas are consistent with the argument that the clouds are smaller than the central unresolved emission region .",
    "we present spectroscopic observations of six high redshift ( @xmath0@xmath1  2 ) quasars , which have been selected because of the presence of a strong proximate ( @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath5 ) coronagraphic dla which covers only the broad line region of the quasar , thus revealing emission from the host galaxy .",
    "we detect spatially extended ly@xmath2 emission envelopes around the six quasars , with projected spatial extent in the range 26  @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath6  51  kpc .",
    "no correlation is found between the quasar ionizing luminosity and the ly@xmath2 luminosity of their extended envelopes .",
    "this could be related to the limited covering factor of the extended gas and/or due to the agn being obscured in other directions than towards the observer .",
    "indeed , we find a strong correlation between the luminosity of the envelope and its spatial extent , which suggests that the envelopes are probably ionized by the agn .",
    "the metallicity of the coronagraphic dlas is low and varies in the range @xmath81.75@xmath9[si / h]@xmath9@xmath80.63 .",
    "highly ionized gas is observed associated with most of these dlas , probably indicating ionization by the central agn .",
    "one of these dlas has the highest aliii / siii ratio ever reported for any intervening and/or proximate dla .",
    "most of these dlas are redshifted with respect to the quasar , implying that they might represent infalling gas probably accreted onto the quasar host galaxies through filaments .",
    "the main mechanisms proposed to power the extended ly@xmath2 emission envelopes around high redshift quasars are photo - ionization by the agn , and cold accretion of neutral hydrogen gas into the quasar dark matter halo . if ionizing photons from the agn are responsible for powering the extended ly@xmath2 emission , a correlation between the quasar and its envelope luminosity is expected . on the other hand , in the cold accretion scenario ,",
    "no such correlation is expected .",
    "cj06 found no correlation between the quasar ionizing luminosity and the luminosity of the ly@xmath2 envelope .",
    "they argued that the lack of correlation can not be due to extinction by dust or absorption by neutral hydrogen in the quasar environments which could potentially affect the quasar luminosity at 912  .",
    "similarly , nc12 found no correlation between the two luminosities for their full sample , apparently confirming the cj06 result , but at higher redshifts and for a larger luminosity range .",
    "nc12 argued that removing the object br2237@xmath80607 from their sample would restore the correlation , implying that the quasar might be the main powering source of the ly@xmath2 envelope .",
    "but the lack of a correlation for their full sample seems to favor the cold accretion scenario .    in our sample ,",
    "the quasar ionizing luminosity does not seem to correlate with the extended ly@xmath2 envelope luminosity .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen in cj06 and nc12 full samples .",
    "however , in section 4.5 , we found a strong correlation between the luminosity of the ly@xmath2 envelope and its spatial extension .",
    "we suggested that this correlation could imply that the quasar ionizing flux might be powering the ly@xmath2 envelopes .",
    "this seems to be at odds with the apparent lack of a correlation between the quasar ionizing luminosity and the ly@xmath2 envelope luminosity .",
    "it is possible that the level of extinction by dust significantly varies from one object to the other in our sample , resulting in highly uncertain measurement of the intrinsic quasar luminosities at 912  .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the cj06 and nc12 samples , the presence of the strong eclipsing dlas at the quasar emission redshift in our sample would also mean higher absorption of the quasar flux by the surrounding neutral hydrogen .",
    "these effects could in principle remove the possible correlation that might have existed between the luminosity of the quasar at 912   and that of the ly@xmath2 envelope in our sample . to circumvent this problem , one can use the infrared spectra of the quasars to better calibrate the quasar template spectrum and consequently get a better estimate of the quasar luminosity at 912  .",
    "better estimate of the quasars ionizing luminosities might restore the correlation .",
    "an important question regarding the origin of the proximate dlas is whether they are due to outflowing material intrinsic to the quasar or some ( infalling ) material unrelated to the agn environment but coincident in redshift with the background quasar . if the dla is part of some low density ( @xmath45  @xmath9  10  @xmath46 ) infalling material close to the central agn , the quasar s ionizing photons could ionize and photoevaporate it ( prochaska & hennawi 2009 ) .",
    "although infalling gas is usually expected to have lower metallicity , associated outflowing absorbers tend to have solar or super solar metallicities ( petitjean et al .",
    "this would in principle allow one to distinguish whether the gas is associated or intervening .",
    "ep10 found that their pdlas with higher hi column densities have metallicities @xmath4  3 times higher than what is seen for the intevening dlas , but still below those expected for an associated absorber .",
    "they argued that their pdlas are probably neither associated nor intervening .",
    "they suggested that pdlas probably probe overdense regions in massive galaxies with higher metallicities in dense clusters .",
    "the metallicities of our eclipsing dlas are low and similar to what is seen in intervening dlas .",
    "this would imply that these absorbers might not be outflowing material driven by the central agn .",
    "the fact that most of our eclipsing dlas have redshifts larger than that of their background quasars further strengthens the idea that these dlas could be associated with some less enriched infalling material accreting onto the quasar host galaxies , probably through filaments as was concluded for the quasar j0823 + 0529 ( fathivavsari et al .",

    "<S> we present spectroscopic observations of six high redshift ( @xmath0  @xmath1  2 ) quasars , which have been selected for their lyman@xmath2 ( ly@xmath2 ) emission region being only partially covered by a strong proximate ( @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath5 ) coronagraphic damped ly@xmath2 system ( dla ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detected spatially extended ly@xmath2 emission envelopes surrounding these six quasars , with projected spatial extent in the range 26  @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath6  51  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> no correlation is found between the quasar ionizing luminosity and the ly@xmath2 luminosity of their extended envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> this could be related to the limited covering factor of the extended gas and/or due to the agn being obscured in other directions than towards the observer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find a strong correlation between the luminosity of the envelope and its spatial extent , which suggests that the envelopes are probably ionized by the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity of the coronagraphic dlas is low and varies in the range @xmath81.75  @xmath9  [ si / h ]  @xmath9  @xmath80.63 </S>",
    "<S> . highly ionized gas is observed to be associated with most of these dlas , probably indicating ionization by the central agn . </S>",
    "<S> one of these dlas has the highest aliii / siii ratio ever reported for any intervening and/or proximate dla . </S>",
    "<S> most of these dlas are redshifted with respect to the quasar , implying that they might represent infalling gas probably accreted onto the quasar host galaxies through filaments .    </S>",
