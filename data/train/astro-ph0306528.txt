    "super - star clusters are extreme among clusters of stars .",
    "they are compact and very luminous , and many are young versions of the massive globular clusters found in giant galaxies like the milky way . the milky way , however , has not been able to form a cluster as compact and massive as a globular cluster for about 10 gy ( although there is a controversial claim that one is forming now ",
    "kndlseder 2000 ) . in spite of this ,",
    "six super - star clusters are known in five nearby dwarf irregular ( dim ) galaxies and are inferred to be present , though still embedded , in 4 others . this led billett , hunter , & elmegreen ( 2002 ) to question what conditions allowed these tiny i m galaxies to form such massive clusters .",
    "billett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) undertook a survey of a sample of i m galaxies that had been observed by the _ hubble space telescope_. they searched 22 galaxies for super - star clusters and the less extreme populous clusters .",
    "they found that super - star clusters are actually relatively rare in i m galaxies , but when they form , they seem to be anomalously luminous compared to other clusters in the galaxy .",
    "that is , the super - star clusters in these galaxies are not part of the normal cluster population as they are in spirals ( larsen & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , most of the i m galaxies that contain them are interacting with another galaxy or undergoing a starburst , suggesting that special events in the life of the galaxy are required to produce the conditions necessary to form the most massive star clusters .",
    "we were intrigued by the question of where the magellanic clouds would fall in this scheme of cluster formation .",
    "we knew that the lmc contained at least one super - star cluster and that both the lmc and smc contained numerous populous clusters .",
    "therefore , it was not obvious to us that the massive star clusters in these galaxies would stand apart from the rest of the cluster population .",
    "the work of larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) , in fact , suggested that the magellanic clouds follow the correlations set by giant spirals , implying that the formation of massive star clusters is just part of the normal cluster formation process in these galaxies .",
    "surveys of clusters in most i m galaxies are incomplete for all but the most massive star clusters .",
    "the exceptions are the lmc and smc which are close enough for a detailed survey of even faint clusters .",
    "hodge ( 1988 ) predicted that there are of order 4200 clusters in the lmc , and current catalogues list 6659 clusters and associations ( bica et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the smc ,",
    "hodge ( 1986 ) predicted 2000 clusters and the bica & dutra ( 2000 ) catalog contains 1237 clusters and associations .",
    "by contrast , the survey of clusters in ngc 4449 by gelatt , hunter , & gallagher ( 2001 ) yielded 61 objects , yet ngc 4449 is comparable in luminosity to the lmc and so one might expect ngc 4449 to contain thousands of clusters .",
    "most of the clusters in the ngc 4449 survey have m@xmath7 , and the survey was certainly not complete to this magnitude .",
    "in addition , the lmc and smc both contain clusters at the massive end of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the lmc and smc are the best i m galaxies in which to examine the statistics of the cluster populations .    therefore , we set out to answer the question : are the super - star clusters and populous clusters in the magellanic clouds merely the top end of the continuum of clusters , or do they stand apart as anomalous relative to the rest of the cluster population ? to answer this question , we need the mass function of star clusters . however , masses are not known for most of the clusters in the clouds and there is no feasible way of measuring them all directly .",
    "instead , we used the luminosity of the cluster as an indicator of the mass . under the reasonable assumption that all star clusters have formed stars from the same stellar initial mass function , the luminosity is proportional to the mass , and we can substitute the luminosity function for the mass function .",
    "the complication is that clusters fade with time .",
    "therefore , we must compare the luminosities at a fiducial age .",
    "after billett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we adopt 10 my as the age at which to compare cluster luminosities .",
    "this , however , means that we must determine the age of each cluster in order to correct the observed luminosity to that at 10 my .",
    "determining the age of each cluster is non - trivial , but doable , and that is what we have done here .    in what follows",
    "we discuss the steps that led to the m@xmath8 function and the resulting mass function of star clusters in the lmc and smc .",
    "we used existing catalogues of clusters ; measured ubvr photometry for each cluster ; compared the colors to cluster evolutionary models to determine an age ; corrected the observed m@xmath8 to m@xmath8(10 my ) , the m@xmath8 the cluster would have had at an age of 10 my ; converted m@xmath8(10 my )  to mass , and examined the distribution functions of these quantities for the ensemble and functions of time .",
    "the term `` populous cluster '' was first used by hodge ( 1961 ) to refer to the rich compact clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the use of the term `` super - star cluster '' arose later to emphasize their extreme nature ( van den bergh 1971 ) .",
    "however , these terms had no quantitative definition . for their survey of clusters in i m galaxies , billett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) adopted definitions based on the integrated m@xmath8 of the cluster at the fiducial age of 10 my .",
    "they defined a super - star cluster as a cluster with a magnitude at 10 my of @xmath910.5 or brighter , and , after larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) , they used @xmath10 as the faint limit for populous clusters .",
    "we will adopt these definitions here .",
    "extensive catalogues of star clusters in the magellanic clouds exist in the literature .",
    "most recently , bica & dutra ( 2000 ) have cataloged clusters in the smc , and bica et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , in the lmc .",
    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) has also produced a catalog of clusters found using visual inspection and automatic algorithms from their imaging materials taken for other purposes ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "these catalogues include previous lists of clusters as well as new candidates found by the authors . these are probably the most complete published catalogues , and so these are what we used . for the smc , we began with the bica and dutra catalog since it already included additional clusters found by the ogle group .",
    "for the lmc , we merged the bica et al .  and ogle catalogues .",
    "we selected objects in the bica et al .",
    "catalogues that were classified by them as `` c '' ( star cluster ) , `` ca '' ( cluster / association ) , `` ac '' ( association / cluster ) , or `` cn '' ( cluster with nebulosity ) .    to determine ages and luminosities of the star clusters , we needed colors and magnitudes . for this , we had available to us images of the magellanic clouds taken by massey ( 2002 ) with the michigan curtis schmidt telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) and a tektronix 2048@xmath112048 ccd .",
    "massey obtained ubvr images and copious landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars .",
    "he provided us with reduced ccd images and photometric calibrations to the standard johnson and cousins system .",
    "the pixel scale of the ccd images is 2.32 .",
    "although bvi photometry was available for the ogle catalog , we felt that the inclusion of u , the use of 4 filters , and the care with which massey calibrated his data made measuring photometry from the schmidt images worthwhile .",
    "similarly , the fine compilations of integrated ubv photometry of clusters already in the literature ( van den bergh 1981 , bica et al .",
    "1996 ) are for small subsets of our list of clusters and are not complete enough for our purposes .",
    "for the lmc there are 11 fields each 1.2@xmath111.2 , and for the smc there are 6 fields .",
    "massey s ( 2002 ) fields together cover an area of 11.0 kpc@xmath1 of the lmc and 8.3 kpc@xmath1 of the smc .",
    "thus , these fields cover most , although not all , of each galaxy .",
    "( see massey s figures 1 and 2 for a sketch of the fields on large - field - of - view images of the smc and lmc ) .",
    "we take these portions of the galaxies as representative of the galaxies as a whole and deal only with the cluster populations found on these images .",
    "we used astrometric solutions of each v - band image to convert the ra and decs of the cluster catalogues to x , y pixel coordinates in each field .",
    "we began by placing a 23  radius circle around each cluster position in each field and examining the region that was circled .",
    "we found that in some cases there really was nothing in the circle that could be distinguished from the rest of the star field of the galaxy .",
    "we discarded these clusters .",
    "thus , to be included in our final analysis a cluster had to be visually distinguishable from the background galaxy and resolved with respect to an isolated star . in some cases , although there was a non - stellar object or concentration of stars in the aperture , we were dubious whether the object was really a star cluster .",
    "usually these were tiny , faint objects that could be nothing more than a few stars superposed along the line of sight .",
    "we flagged these objects as questionable , and they are plotted with different symbols and given lower weight in the analysis that follows .",
    "the number of clusters in the lmc was 854 with 181 flagged as questionable . in the smc",
    "there were 239 clusters with 106 flagged as questionable .",
    "we also found that the cluster was not always in the center of the marked circle , and we adjusted the position accordingly . from visual examination , we also determined the size of the aperture needed for the photometry of the cluster .",
    "the aperture was chosen to include the cluster , but exclude as much as possible extraneous field stars to the extent that this was obvious .",
    "sky was determined from an annulus around the cluster with an interior radius that was 7  beyond the cluster aperture and 11.6  wide .",
    "astrometry for each image was used to transform the position of each aperture from the v - band image to the other filters .",
    "because the fields overlap , there were some clusters that appeared and were measured on more than one field . in the lmc",
    "there were 247 duplicate measurements covering v from 9.5 to 16.5 and in the smc , 70 covering v from 10.5 to 15.5 .",
    "a comparison of the photometry between pairs of measurements gives us an idea of the reliability of the photometry .",
    "for both the lmc and smc , the average difference in the measured v magnitude was 0.16 magnitudes . for the smc the average differences in the colors was 0.04 , 0.05 , and 0.07 for u@xmath9b , b@xmath9v , and v@xmath9r , respectively .",
    "for the lmc the average differences were 0.08 , 0.07 , and 0.08 .",
    "for the brighter clusters with v less than 12.5 , the differences were 0.1 in v for both the lmc and smc , 0.03 and 0.04 for u@xmath9b for the two galaxies , 0.05 and 0.02 for b@xmath9v , and 0.03 for v@xmath9r .",
    "thus , the photometry of the clusters appears to be reasonable .",
    "we corrected the colors and magnitudes for reddening using a single reddening for each galaxy .",
    "for the lmc we used an e(b@xmath9v ) of 0.13 mag . and for the smc 0.09 mag .",
    "we used these with the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "we used a distance modulus of 18.48 for the lmc and 18.94 for the smc .",
    "motivated primarily by interest in the age distribution of clusters as a clue to the cluster formation history , people have long been interested in the ages of clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "searle , wilkinson , & bagnuolo ( 1980 ) were perhaps the first to recognize that the integrated colors of star clusters in the magellanic clouds produce an age sequence on a color - color diagram ( ccd ) .",
    "they used integrated uvgr colors to provide a relative ranking of the ages of 61 clusters in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "frenk & fall ( 1982 ) then moved to the more common ubv - system in their study of 52 clusters in the lmc .",
    "since then , various studies have worked on determining a transformation from ubv colors to age , including frenk & fall ( 1982 ) , elson & fall ( 1985 ) , chiosi , bertelli , & bressan ( 1988 ) , girardi & bica ( 1993 ) , and girardi et al .",
    "others have also applied various techniques for determining ages of small samples , including examination of the upper asymptotic giant branch ( mould & aaronson 1982 ) , integrated spectroscopy ( rabin 1982 ) , and main - sequence photometry ( hodge 1983 ) .",
    "others have examined the bigger clusters through the traditional method of placing individual stars on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and comparing to stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the advantage of determining ages from integrated cluster colors is that the technique can be applied to large samples ; the disadvantage is that it is not as accurate .",
    "the best method is cmd fitting of the individual stars within the cluster but this requires high resolution images in order to resolve the individual stars well enough for crowded - field photometric techniques to work and careful attention to the photometry and to subtraction of the interloper stellar population . because of concerns for these issues and because of the need for a complete sample of clusters , we have not used the ages determined by pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999 , 2000 ) from automatic photometry of the ogle project .    instead",
    ", we have used our ubvr integrated photometry and the new cluster evolutionary models that are now available . in this way we have a uniform way of determining ages for all clusters in our sample .",
    "we recognize that the ages of individual clusters are uncertain , but expect that the sample taken as a whole will give an accurate picture of the cluster population .",
    "specifically , we have used the leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) cluster models for the evolution to 1 gy , with the z@xmath120.004 models for the smc and the z@xmath120.008 models for the lmc .",
    "we converted their v@xmath9r on the johnson system to the cousins system using the formula of bessell ( 1979 ) .",
    "these are denoted ( v@xmath9r)@xmath13 . for ages beyond 1 gy , we used the ubv colors given by searle , sargent , & bagnuolo ( 1973 ) for 3 and 10 gy .",
    "the searle et al .",
    "colors at 1 gy match those given by the leitherer et al .",
    "models , so the searle et al .",
    "models join smoothly to the leitherer et al .",
    "we then used the globular clusters for ( v@xmath9r)@xmath13 ( reed 1985 ) and the work by charlot & bruzual ( 1991 ) for the evolution of v with age for 110 gy .",
    "we used two ccds for comparison of clusters and models : ubv and bvr .",
    "the model tracks are different in these diagrams for the smc and lmc because of the difference in metallicity between the two galaxies .",
    "one lmc field is shown in figure [ fig : lmcccd ] and one smc field is shown in figure [ fig : smcccd ] .",
    "determining the age of each cluster is fraught with problems .",
    "first , some clusters simply fall in parts of the diagram not visited by the models .",
    "therefore , no age could be assigned and these clusters were eliminated . if a cluster was reasonable on one ccd and fell far from the models on the other , we assigned an age based on the diagram that was reasonable .",
    "second , there are parts of the ccds where the models loop back on themselves so that clusters of different ages have similar colors .",
    "this is particularly the case in the age range of about 630 my . for clusters falling in this region",
    ", we did our best to determine a most likely age or took an average of possible ages .",
    "a third source of uncertainty is stochastic effects due to small numbers of stars .",
    "this affects the smaller clusters more than the rich clusters .",
    "this problem is discussed and simulated by girardi & bica ( 1993 ; see also santos & frogel 1997 , brocato et al .",
    "their simulations show a scatter of several tenths in ubv colors for small clusters as individual stars evolving within the cluster jerk the cluster colors around .",
    "some of the richer clusters have well - determined ages based on main - sequence turn - offs or other features derived from stellar evolutionary models .",
    "in addition , the brightest clusters were often saturated in some of our filters , making it impossible for us to determine some colors .",
    "therefore , we adopted the ages in the literature that we felt were on solid ground . in the lmc",
    "these clusters included ngc 1711 , ngc 1754 , ngc 1786 , ngc 1806 , ngc 1835 , ngc 1850 , ngc 1856 , ngc 1898 , ngc 1953 , ngc 2004 , sl 503 , and sl 569 ( hodge & lee 1984 , geisler et al .",
    "1997 , olsen et al.1998 ) . in the smc three clusters had cmd ages : ngc 330 , ngc 361 , and ngc 416 ( carney et al .",
    "1985 ; mighell , sarajedini , & french 1998a , b ) .",
    "a comparison of our photometrically determined ages with the ages from cmds is given in figure [ fig : compareages ] .",
    "we have plotted the clusters to show multiple ages determined from colors measured from different fields and to show the range in ages given from cmds .",
    "ages determined from colors agree well with each other , but not always with that determined from the cmd .",
    "there is no systematic trend except for the oldest clusters for which colors tend to underestimate the ages , giving ages of 13 gy where cmds give ages of 715 gy .",
    "we have examined the uncertainties in the ages determined from integrated colors in another way .",
    "we asked what age ranges would be consistent with colors extracted from the cluster evolutionary models at particular ages and given a typical uncertainty of @xmath140.05 mag .",
    "the uncertainties in the log of the ages for the z@xmath120.008 and for the z@xmath120.004 models are given in table 1 .",
    "the quantities that are tabulated are the absolute difference between the log of the extreme in the allowed ages and the log of the input age .",
    "an uncertainty in the log of the age of order 0.100.15 dex is typical except in regions of the color - color diagrams where the cluster evolutionary tracks loop back on each other . for the z@xmath120.008 model",
    ", the uncertainty goes up to 0.53 dex between 2060 my because of confusion with the 5 - 7 my part of the evolutionary track for 2030 my old clusters and the 1517 my part of the track for 4060 my old clusters . for clusters 7080 my there is confusion , within the allowed photometric uncertainties , with the 67 my and 1316 my parts of the track , and this causes the uncertainty to rise even higher to 1.06 dex . for the z@xmath120.004 model ,",
    "confusion with the 1820 my part of the cluster evolutionary track causes an uncertainty of 0.31 dex in the log of the age for a 10 my - old cluster .",
    "the 20 my - old cluster is confused with the 57 my and 912 my parts of the evolutionary tracks . for clusters with colors that have uncertainties greater than 0.05",
    "mag , the uncertainties in the ages will , of course , be higher as well .",
    "however , the preceding exercise assumed that clusters are evolving strictly along the cluster evolutionary tracks and only uncertainties in the colors are causing confusion .",
    "the comparisons with ages determined from cmds given in figure [ fig : compareages ] may be more realistic and they paint a less optimistic picture .",
    "there are not very many clusters with ages determined this way , but the cmds suggest that for clusters with ages @xmath15100 my the uncertainty in the log of the age is 0.5 dex , for 1001000 my it is 0.6 dex , and for @xmath161000 my it is 0.8 dex .",
    "obviously , use of integrated colors is not the preferred way to determine the age of a cluster , but it is hoped that the ensemble of clusters will still be statistically representative for our purposes .",
    "cluster evaporation could cause the color ages to be lower than the cmd ages because color ages are based on all the stars while cmd ages are based primarily on the most massive stars .",
    "since low mass stars are preferentially lost during evaporation , clusters should have an excess of intermediate and high mass stars compared to the lowest mass stars , and therefore be slightly too blue compared to a model cluster with the full stellar initial mass function still present .",
    "detailed modelling of the evaporation process will be needed to determine the conversion from color ages to cmd ages .",
    "we note that the clusters with the most discrepant ages in our study are those closest to the evaporation limit discussed below .    in the lmc we found that there are 5 star clusters with m@xmath8(10 my )  of @xmath17 to @xmath18 , implying that these are very massive star clusters .",
    "all of these clusters are bright , with current m@xmath8 of @xmath19 to @xmath20 . however , four of them have ages 1415 gy .",
    "these very old ages come from cmds and we can find no fault with the published work .",
    "the fifth cluster has an age of 3 gy that comes from colors , but the colors look very reasonable , so we have no reason to discount the cluster .",
    "therefore , we are forced to conclude that these really were very luminous when they were young , and that the lmc has hosted some extreme clusters in its distant past .    in the smc",
    "we also find 4 clusters with m@xmath8(10 my )  of @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "again , the clusters are bright and have ages of 28 gy .",
    "the ages of two of these clusters come from cmds .",
    "the other two come from the ccds but the colors fall on the models .",
    "thus , it appears that even the smc has produced some extreme clusters in its distant past .",
    "the final number of clusters in our sample for the lmc is 748 with 140 flagged as questionable from their appearance .",
    "the total for the smc is 191 with 76 flagged as questionable .",
    "the distribution of present - day absolute v magnitude of the clusters in the lmc is shown in figure [ fig : nmag ] .",
    "the solid - line histogram in this figure and in the following figures are for the certain 608 clusters , while the dotted histograms are the additional 140 clusters that are questionable .",
    "the distribution has a cutoff at the faint end with a magnitude limit of @xmath23 at the half - peak point , a long extension toward the bright end , and a number of very bright clusters that exceeds a power - law extrapolation at this bright end .",
    "the questionable clusters are mostly near the faint end , as expected .",
    "the various cluster ages are separated in figure [ fig : nmv ] .",
    "the lower limit of brightness is the same for each age bin less than @xmath24 my , and the upper limit is about the same for each age too .",
    "the oldest clusters are only massive clusters .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a present - day cluster was converted to the absolute magnitude the cluster had at an age of 10 my using the colors and evolution models discussed in the previous section .",
    "this value of m@xmath8(10 my )  was then converted to cluster mass using @xmath25 mag as the absolute magnitude of a 10 my old @xmath26 m_@xmath27  cluster with a metallicity of @xmath28 for the lmc ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath29 figure [ fig : nmass ] shows the resulting distribution of cluster masses separated by age . the mass distribution shifts toward higher cluster mass with increasing age because of two effects .",
    "first , the low mass end of the distribution shifts toward higher cluster mass because clusters fade with age , so higher mass clusters produce the same absolute magnitude at the limit of the survey as the age increases .",
    "this shift in limiting detectable mass goes approximately as @xmath30 for @xmath31 , based on a power law fit to the tabulated m@xmath8(t ) in leitherer ( 1999 ) for metallicity @xmath28 ( see eqn . [",
    "eq : limit ] and [ eq : mv ] below ) . thus the limiting mass increases by a factor of @xmath32 for each decade in age .",
    "second , the upper limit of the cluster mass distribution increases with age because of the size - of - sample effect , in which larger numbers of clusters sample further into the high mass tail of the cluster mass distribution function .",
    "the logarithmic time intervals in figure [ fig : nmass ] mean that older age intervals encompass longer time intervals and more cluster formation .",
    "for a cluster mass function , the number of clusters as a function of the mass of the cluster , written in linear intervals of mass , @xmath33 the maximum likely cluster mass scales with the number @xmath34 of clusters as @xmath35 which comes from the equations @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath38 was observed directly by whitmore ( 2003 ) using a large number of galaxy surveys , and it was used by billett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and larsen ( 2002 ) to help explain the larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) correlation between the fraction of star formation in the form of clusters and the star formation rate . for @xmath4 in the likely range from 2 to 2.6 ,",
    "the maximum mass scales with cluster number to a power between 1 and 0.62 .",
    "figure [ fig : nmass ] plots cluster mass histograms in logarithmic intervals of time .",
    "if the star formation rate is about constant , @xmath39constant , then the number of clusters that form in each log - time interval increases directly with time ( @xmath40 ) . thus the maximum mass increases with time @xmath41 in this context",
    ", a constant star formation rate means a constant average rate , averaged over the time interval considered . if the star formation rate was larger at previous times , then the number of clusters formed in each log time interval increases faster than @xmath42 and the mass of the largest cluster in @xmath43 intervals increases faster than @xmath44 .",
    "for example , if @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",
    "the similarity between the time dependence of @xmath47 and the time dependence of @xmath38 for @xmath48 to 2.5 explains why the mass distribution functions in figure [ fig : nmass ] shift to the right with increasing @xmath42 without changing their shape much .",
    "an exception occurs for the oldest clusters , which are clearly lacking in low mass members although their highest masses fit the extrapolation from younger clusters . for these very old clusters",
    ", evaporation is also depleting the lower masses , as we shall see momentarily .",
    "the dashed lines in each histogram are reference lines with slopes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 on this log - log plot .",
    "these correspond to @xmath51 and @xmath6 , which is in the range of solutions for our lmc data ( although this is not obvious from the mass functions in figure [ fig : nmass ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature of figure [ fig : nmass ] is that the high mass ends of the distributions in the middle three age bins overlap in mass and are all more massive than the turnover masses , where fading becomes important for each time .",
    "this means that the sum of the distributions , which is the total mass distribution for all clusters regardless of age , will also be a power law in this mass range , and the power will be about the same as it is in each age bin .",
    "the distribution of cluster mass and age is shown in figure [ fig : agemass ] , following boutloukos & lamers ( 2003 ) .",
    "the open circles are the questionable clusters .",
    "the lower limit to the cluster mass , populated mostly by the questionable clusters , fits well to the fading limit ( solid line in figure [ fig : agemass ] ) , given by the equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the observed cutoff magnitude of the survey , from figure [ fig : nmag ] , and @xmath54 is the fading function from figure 47c in leitherer et al .",

    "equations [ eq : limit ] and [ eq : mv ] lead to equation [ eq : mfade ] above .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : agemass ] is the evaporation limit , given by the equation ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) @xmath58 for cluster number @xmath59 , galactocentric radius @xmath60 , and galactic orbit speed @xmath61 in the lmc .",
    "the two lines represent radii of @xmath62 kpc and 2 kpc , for which @xmath63 km s@xmath64 and 50 km s@xmath64 , respectively , from figure 6 in kim et al .",
    "masses smaller than the limit given by the dashed line for their age should have evaporated by now .",
    "the distribution of points in figure [ fig : agemass ] illustrates the simultaneous effects of fading and size - of - sample that were discussed above in reference to figure [ fig : nmass ] . the lower limit to the mass increases with time approximately as a power law @xmath65 from the fading limit , and the upper limit increases right along with it from the size - of - sample effect , keeping the total range in mass about constant for each time interval .",
    "the maximum cluster masses for each logarithmic time interval are shown as plus - symbols .",
    "these plus symbols are placed at the centers of the age intervals , so the corresponding dots for each symbol are shifted slightly to the left or right .",
    "figure [ fig : maxmass ] shows the maximum cluster mass in each age interval , from the plus - signs in figure [ fig : agemass ] , versus the cluster age . in all cases",
    "except one at a low age , the maximum mass cluster is a bonafide cluster , not a questionable cluster .",
    "the open circles are for age intervals where the maximum mass cluster is close to or below the evaporation limit .",
    "the distribution of points is fitted to a linear regression as @xmath66 .",
    "this fit does not include the open circles because their masses could be severely depleted by evaporation .",
    "a fit to ages less than 100 my gives a linear regression @xmath67 .",
    "the maximum mass is expected to increase with the number of clusters , but the true number of clusters that ever formed in the lmc is not observed because of fading effects .",
    "this figure corrects for this cluster loss by considering that they form at a constant rate , in which case the total number of clusters that formed in each log interval of time is proportional to the age . by plotting maximum mass versus age we can reconstruct the expected size - of - sample correlation without actually counting all the faded , destroyed , or evaporated clusters , which tend to be lower mass .",
    "the slope of this correlation , @xmath68 below @xmath69 my and @xmath70 overall , suggests a cluster mass function with @xmath4 in the range from 1.95 to 2.35 , respectively , as given by equation [ eq : mmax ] .",
    "if the highest mass clusters are underestimated in age , as suggested by figure [ fig : compareages ] , then the slope overall will be smaller than 2.35 .",
    "thus we consider the initial cluster mass function in the lmc to have a slope in the range from 1.95 to 2.35 .",
    "figure [ fig : maxmass ] can be used to find the cluster formation history in a galaxy if the initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) , destruction rate , and fading rate are known independently .",
    "the icmf is the number of clusters as a function of the initial integrated mass of the cluster . if we consider that @xmath51 from the observation of young clusters , and we assume a cluster formation rate @xmath45 as above , then the overall slope of @xmath70 in the figure implies @xmath71 giving @xmath72 . in this case , the cluster formation rate in the age period from @xmath73 to @xmath74 my was smaller than that in the age period from @xmath75 to @xmath73 my by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "this assumes that the destruction time is longer than the fading time , as before , and that the color ages up to @xmath74 my are reasonably accurate .",
    "figure [ fig : nmassall ] shows the total mass distribution function with all ages combined ( see also boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) .",
    "this is the sum of the separate distributions in figure [ fig : nmass ] ; it is also a count of clusters projected against the ordinate in figure [ fig : agemass ] . for the lmc we have the fortunate situation where clusters more massive than the fading limit have a wide range of ages ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : agemass ] ) , so the total mass distribution shows a power law section that is approximately the sum of the primeval power law sections from each separate age bin .",
    "the flat part of the total distribution contains information about the cluster mass function as well .",
    "both the flat and power - law parts of the total mass distribution were modelled using an initial cluster mass function , @xmath77 , that is a power law , and using the fading limit from equation [ eq : limit ] ( which considers the tabulation in leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and our extrapolation to larger ages ) .",
    "this model gives the expected number @xmath34 of clusters above the fading limit in each linear interval of mass as @xmath78 for adjustable constant @xmath79 in the case where @xmath80 for some maximum time of cluster formation , @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 , the number of clusters varies with mass as @xmath83 which is proportional to the initial cluster mass function , @xmath77 .",
    "the plotted models are @xmath84 , which is appropriate for logarithmic intervals of mass .",
    "this is @xmath85 for @xmath80 and @xmath86 for @xmath82 .",
    "this expression for @xmath80 shows right away that the total mass distribution can have the observed flat part at low mass if @xmath87 .",
    "the model assumes a nearly constant star formation rate ( as defined above ) and that fading alone provides the lower limit to the observed cluster mass .",
    "this latter assumption is verified by the good fit between the fading line in figure [ fig : agemass ] and the lower limit to the observed cluster masses .",
    "other destruction mechanisms are possible , such as collisions between clusters or between clusters and dense clouds .",
    "our observation that fading contributed most to the lower mass limit implies that for all masses the fading time is less than the destruction time .",
    "if there were a mass range where the destruction time was less than the fading time ( as might be the case in other galaxies  see boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) , then we would have to take an upper limit to the integral in equation [ eq : n ] that is the minimum value of the fading time and the destruction time .",
    "three maximum times are considered in figure [ fig : nmassall ] : 2 gy , 5 gy , and 7 gy , as indicated . for each time",
    "we adjust the constant @xmath79 in front of equation [ eq : n ] to match the flat part of the observed @xmath88 distribution .",
    "the excess low - mass clusters that come from the downward dips in @xmath89 at low @xmath42 in figure [ fig : agemass ] are ignored .",
    "they do not affect the flat part of @xmath88 and tend to influence only the integral under the @xmath88 curve , which is the total number of clusters that forms . as a result ,",
    "the theoretical fits for the next figure , which plots the number of clusters versus age , are slightly too high for the same parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : nmassall ] has a kink at @xmath90 m@xmath57 and this is the mass corresponding to the fading limit at @xmath81 .",
    "masses beyond this have not faded ( and apparently they have not been destroyed or evaporated either except at much larger mass  cf .",
    "[ fig : agemass ] ) , and so they have not been lost from our survey . as a result , the theoretical mass function integrated over all ages in figure [ fig : nmassall ] has about the same slope as the initial cluster mass function , @xmath77 , for @xmath91 m@xmath57 .",
    "this slope is taken to have three values in the figure , ranging from 2 to 2.4 .",
    "the model with initial cluster mass function slope @xmath51 is too steeply rising compared to the observations in the mass range from @xmath73 to @xmath92 m@xmath57 , but it is acceptable for the power law part above @xmath92 m@xmath57 , not counting the most massive clusters .",
    "the case with @xmath93 fits the flat part best , it fits the power law part reasonably well if the most massive clusters are not included , and it has the best value for @xmath81 ( which was adjusted to match the observed kink in @xmath88 at @xmath92 m@xmath57 ) considering the observed distribution of ages in figure [ fig : agemass ] . the fading line in that figure was drawn with the extrapolation of the leitherer et al .",
    "model out to @xmath94 gy , which was the best fit in figure [ fig : nmassall ] .",
    "figure [ fig : nmassall ] shows an excess of massive clusters beyond @xmath95 m@xmath57 . where this excess begins determines the best fit to the power law part of the mass function ; if it starts at @xmath96 m@xmath57 , then the best fit is @xmath93 , but if it starts at @xmath97 m@xmath57 , then @xmath51 may be preferred .",
    "the massive clusters are also the oldest clusters ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : agemass ] ) . for these two reasons",
    ", they appear to be a distinct population of clusters , like the halo globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "their distributions do not appear to be extrapolations of the distributions for the less massive and younger clusters .",
    "this allows for the possibility that the oldest massive clusters formed by a distinct mechanism , or that they formed by the same general mechanism but at a much higher rate than the disk clusters , with substantial evaporation and destruction of the lowest mass members , leaving only an excess of massive clusters now .",
    "figure [ fig : nageall ] shows the distribution of cluster ages , summed over all masses ( see also boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) .",
    "this is the count of clusters projected against the abscissa in figure [ fig : agemass ] .",
    "the distribution is flat over times less than @xmath98 gy because the fading rate of clusters at the low mass end keeps pace with the broadening of the mass distribution at the high mass end , which comes from the size - of - sample effect at increasing @xmath99(t ) .",
    "the three models are the same as in figure [ fig : nmassall ] .",
    "the one with @xmath93 is the best fit to the flat slope of the distribution .",
    "all of the models lie above the distribution because of the over - representation of low mass clusters at the wiggles in the @xmath100 function .",
    "the theoretical models for figure [ fig : nageall ] come from the equation @xmath101 with the plotted quantity equal to @xmath102 in intervals of @xmath43 .",
    "the constants @xmath79 for the three cases are the same as in figure [ fig : nmassall ] .",
    "the flat part in this figure requires again @xmath103 .    the age gap between @xmath104 gy and @xmath105 gy ( rich , shara , & zurek 2001 ) is evident from figure [ fig : nageall ] .",
    "this gap is consistent with the age cutoffs we have assumed for the models and it reinforces our conclusion that the oldest massive clusters are a distinct population .",
    "figure [ fig : agemass ] suggests that this gap is partly the result of severe evaporation , but the most massive clusters from this time period should still be visible if the star formation rate were the same as it is today .",
    "as it is , the most massive clusters are close to the evaporation limit because the cluster formation rate was low .",
    "there is no reason to think that the cluster formation rate was zero in this period , only that it was so low that the most massive likely cluster has suffered from evaporation . in that case , all the lower mass clusters would be gone or imperceptible by now .",
    "returning to figure [ fig : maxmass ] , we see that the open circles from this age period have about the same maximum mass as those in the period from @xmath73 to @xmath74 my .",
    "this means that the slope of a line drawn through these points is zero , and so @xmath106 giving @xmath107 independent of the icmf slope , @xmath4 .",
    "thus the cluster formation rate was a factor of at most @xmath108 less in the period from @xmath98 to @xmath108 gy than it was in the period from @xmath73 - @xmath74 my .",
    "the factor could have been smaller if the most massive clusters in this period lost mass by evaporation .",
    "if our ages or masses turn out to be wrong for these few clusters , then the drop in the cluster formation rate could have been greater .",
    "the clusters that are important for this time period are listed in table 2 .",
    "analogous results for the small magellanic cloud are shown in figures [ fig : snmag ] to [ fig : snageall ] .",
    "the faintness limit to the absolute magnitude for the smc is @xmath109 mag , from figure [ fig : snmag ] , and that determines the fading line in figure [ fig : sagemass ] . the fading model for the smc uses the z=0.004 case from figure 47d in leitherer et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "the smc distance is assumed to be 60 kpc . in this model ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of a @xmath26 m@xmath57 cluster is @xmath110 for use in equation [ eq : mass ] , and the extrapolated fit in equation [ eq : mv ] is @xmath111 .",
    "the rotation curve is from torres & carranza ( 1987 ) ; it suggests @xmath112 km s@xmath64 at @xmath62 kpc and @xmath113 km s@xmath64 at @xmath114 kpc for the evaporation limit in figure [ fig : sagemass ] .",
    "the results for the smc are similar to those for the lmc : faintness limits the cluster masses at the low end and size - of - sample limits them at the high end .",
    "the best fit to the cumulative mass and age functions and to the maximum mass - versus - age plot is for a icmf with a negative slope near @xmath93 for linear intervals of mass .",
    "this gives the slope of @xmath115 in figure [ fig : smaxmass ] , which is the clearest measure of the icmf in this case .",
    "the smc is also like the lmc in having old massive clusters that are not simple extrapolations of the total cluster mass function . figures",
    "[ fig : snmass ] and [ fig : snmasall ] show these clusters well .",
    "figure [ fig : sizemassboth ] shows the cluster masses versus sizes ( fwhm ) for both galaxies .",
    "the symbol types indicate age .",
    "the increase in mass with age shows up here as it did in earlier figures .",
    "the young age symbols are at the bottom and the old age symbols are at the top .",
    "there is no analogous shift of symbol - type to the right , which means that clusters do not get significantly larger with time for a given mass .",
    "there is a slight trend for more massive clusters to be physically larger .",
    "the maximum cluster size also increases with mass , as shown schematically with a line on the right of each panel that marks the outer envelope .",
    "figure [ fig : agesizeboth ] shows the cluster size versus age .",
    "there is a trend for the largest clusters to get larger with age , but this is probably the size - of - sample effect .",
    "larger times correspond to larger time intervals on this log - abscissa plot , and to a larger total number of clusters forming in each log - time interval .",
    "thus the maximum cluster mass increases to the right in the figure , as discussed before , and the maximum size increases toward the right also , along with the mass .",
    "the line in the figure shows the predicted size - of - sample effect based on the relations between @xmath38 and time from figures [ fig : maxmass ] and [ fig : smaxmass ] and the schematic lines in figure [ fig : sizemassboth ] .",
    "these relations are @xmath116    our size measurements are not as accurate as those of mackey & gilmore ( 2003a , b ) , who used hst data , but we have more clusters to see the size - of - sample effects better",
    ". their correlation between cluster size and age , which is slightly steeper than ours , could have the same origin . in this case",
    ", there would be no specific physical explanation for the occurrence of larger clusters at older ages , only a broader sampling of the massive end of the initial cluster mass function at these ages .",
    "the agreement between the lower cluster mass limit as a function of age in figures [ fig : agemass ] and [ fig : sagemass ] and the fading limit suggests that clusters are lost from view mostly by fading and not by destruction in these two galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion by boutloukos & lamers ( 2003 ) who found a long destruction time for the smc ( @xmath117 yrs ) .",
    "they did not analyze data for the lmc .",
    "our overall result for the smc differs from theirs , however , because we do not attempt to fit two distinct power law parts to the cluster mass distribution integrated over age or to the cluster age distribution integrated over mass , but instead we fit both distributions as a whole to the fading - statistical model .",
    "boutloukos & lamers also assumed an icmf slope of @xmath118 for the smc , but the flat part of the age distribution integrated over mass requires a steeper initial function , @xmath93 , unless the star formation rate was smaller by a factor of @xmath119 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 my ago than it is today .",
    "figure [ fig : maxmass ] suggested a new way to determine the icmf from the size of sample effect . size - of - sample effects appear as a hidden influence in many studies of star clusters .",
    "they contribute to the impression that starburst regions form more massive clusters ( billett et al .",
    "2002 ; larsen 2002 ) .",
    "they may also account for the increase in cluster size with age that was found by mackey & gilmore ( 2003a , b ) , as shown in the previous section . in figure",
    "[ fig : maxmass ] , the size - of - sample effect appears as a correlation between the age and the mass of the most massive cluster at that age ( in logarithmic age bins ) .",
    "this may be a better way to determine the icmf than the slope on a log - log histogram of cluster mass for either a single age ( which can have poor statistics ) or integrated over age ( which can give the wrong slope because of the age mixture ) .",
    "the icmf slopes found here are in the range from @xmath118 to @xmath120 , depending on the cluster formation history .",
    "the steeper end of this range exceeds the slope of @xmath118 found in the antenna galaxy ( zhang & fall 1999 ) , but is consistent with values found by larsen ( 2002 ) for several galaxies after he corrected for size - of - sample effects .",
    "the oldest clusters in the lmc and smc are all massive .",
    "lower mass counterparts could have been observed above the fading limit , but they are not present .",
    "they may have evaporated because the oldest clusters are close to the evaporation limit for all masses in figures [ fig : agemass ] and [ fig : sagemass ] .",
    "alternatively , the oldest clusters in the lmc and smc could have had a different initial mass distribution , such as a gaussian distribution in log - mass ( vesperini 2001 ) .",
    "we can not tell the difference between this initial function and a power law because the number of massive clusters is too small and the evaporation mass limit is too high ( all lower mass clusters have evaporated ) .",
    "de grijs , bastian , & lamers ( 2003 ) suggest that an initially power - law cluster mass function in m82 has begun to turn over at low mass in its gradual progression toward a gaussian .",
    "m82 is a better place to observe this than the lmc or smc because the number of clusters and the tidal density in m82 are both large .",
    "the large tidal density makes the cluster evaporation time smaller , and then fading is less severe for clusters in the last stages of evaporation .",
    "the integrated properties of clusters in the lmc and smc were measured from ground - based images and analyzed to determine the likely slope for the power - law form of the initial cluster mass function .",
    "this slope can not be determined by conventional means because the blend of ages prevents the combined cluster mass function from revealing the initial function , and because the sample is too small to get a statistically significant cluster mass function in a narrow age range .",
    "we could still determine the initial cluster mass function from the data , however , using a combination of theoretical fading limits and the size - of - sample effect .",
    "the size - of - sample effect follows from the assumption that clusters randomly sample a physically - determined mass function and so larger samples are likely to have larger most - massive clusters .",
    "the results suggest that the initial cluster mass function is a power law with a slope between @xmath118 and @xmath120 for the lmc and smc , nearly independent of time .",
    "the slope was determined independently using three methods : a fit of the model to the total mass function integrated over all cluster ages , a fit of the same model to the number of clusters versus age integrated over all masses , and a least - squares fit to the maximum cluster mass versus age .",
    "if there is a significant number of high mass clusters that are not part of the icmf , then @xmath93 is preferred for each galaxy .    the maximum cluster mass and the maximum cluster size increase with age when plotted in equal intervals of log - age because the total number of clusters increases linearly with age in such a distribution .",
    "then , as the number of clusters increases , the high ends of the distribution functions get sampled further out . the lower limit to the observed cluster mass increases with age too because of fading .",
    "both vary with age in about the same way for the lmc and smc , so the histogram of cluster mass shifts in a nearly self - similar way toward higher cluster masses for aging clusters .",
    "the oldest clusters in the lmc and smc stand apart from the most obvious extrapolations found for younger clusters .",
    "they are all very massive and they lie far above the fading limits . either a large population of them has already evaporated or low mass clusters did not form in early times .",

    "<S> the properties of @xmath0 star clusters in the large and small magellanic clouds were determined from ground - based ccd images in ubvr passbands . </S>",
    "<S> the areal coverage was extensive , corresponding to 11.0 kpc@xmath1 in the lmc and 8.3 kpc@xmath1 in the smc . </S>",
    "<S> after corrections for reddening , the colors and magnitudes of the clusters were converted to ages and masses , and the resulting mass distributions were searched for the effects of fading , evaporation , and size - of - sample bias . </S>",
    "<S> the data show a clear signature of cluster fading below the detection threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) was determined by fitting the mass and age distributions with cluster population models . </S>",
    "<S> these models suggest a new method to determine the icmf that is nearly independent of fading or disruption and is based on the slope of a correlation between age and the maximum cluster mass in equally spaced intervals of log - age . for a nearly uniform star formation rate , this correlation has a slope equal to @xmath2 for an icmf of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that @xmath4 is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the lmc and smc using this method plus another method in which models are fit to the mass distribution integrated over age and to the age distribution integrated over mass . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum mass method also suggests that the cluster formation rate in the lmc age gap between 3 and 13 gy is about a factor of ten below that in the period from 0.1 gy to 1 gy . </S>",
    "<S> the oldest clusters correspond in age and mass to halo globular clusters in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> they do not fit the trends for lower - mass clusters but appear to be a separate population that either had a very high star formation rate and became depleted by evaporation or formed with only high masses . </S>"
