    "the circular velocity function ( vf ) , the space density of galaxies as a function of their rotation velocities , is directly related to total dynamical masses of the galaxies and not dominated by their baryonic content , unlike the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) @xcite . as a tracer of dark matter halo masses (",
    "* hereafter z10 ) , the vf can be used as a test of the @xmath3cdm paradigm @xcite and a probe of cosmological parameters @xcite or the relation between the dark matter halo and galaxy rotation velocities .",
    "observationally , vf differs significantly from the lf .",
    "the latter , although difficult to predict and interpret theoretically , is much easier to measure @xcite .    measuring the vf is difficult on all halo mass scales .",
    "cluster rotation velocities have completely different dynamical properties and require different observational methods than individual galaxies @xcite , while the lowest velocity galaxy samples are not complete . even at intermediate",
    "the vf has not been fully constrained , because circular velocity measurements for gas - poor early - types , dominating the high velocity end of the galaxy velocity function , are notoriously challenging @xcite . .",
    "several studies have attempted to use galaxy scaling relations in order to infer circular velocities from more accessible observable quantities .",
    "@xcite estimate a vf by converting the ssrs2 luminosity function using the tully - fisher relation . .",
    "a similar approach was adopted by @xcite , who construct galaxy group and field vfs using velocity estimates based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric data .",
    "@xcite construct cluster and field vfs by using sdss data tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations .    in @xcite",
    "a local volume vf , complete down to @xmath4 @xmath5 15 km s@xmath1 , was estimated using a combination of hi observations and line - of - sight velocities estimated from photometry .",
    "however , their study does not sample the velocities above @xmath5 200 km s@xmath1 .    an hi velocity function down to 30 km s@xmath1 was directly measured from hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) linewidths .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in @xcite , massive , rapidly rotating , gas - poor ellipticals are systematically missing from hipass data .",
    "therefore its high velocity end is very incomplete .",
    "@xcite ( p11 ) estimate the hi linewidth function from arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey data and suggest using the linewidth function as a more useful probe of the halo mass distribusion .",
    "they also provide a vf for all types by combining their vf with the velocity function converted from @xcite velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "califa is in a unique position with its well - understood selection function a wide field of view the first ifs sample that includes a large number of galaxies with diverse morphologies . as described in @xcite , 80% of early - type galaxies",
    "can be expected to have a rotating component .",
    "the use of stellar kinematics enables us to include gas - poor , rotating early - type galaxies in a homogeneous manner .",
    "therefore we are able to directly measure the vf for rotating galaxies of all morphological types , in contrast to the inferred vfs reported by @xcite .    within this work",
    ", we assume a benchmark cosmological model with @xmath6 70 km s@xmath1/mpc , @xmath7 0.7 and @xmath8 0.3 .",
    "all vfs from the literature were rescaled to this particular cosmology , as described in @xcite .",
    "califa observations use the pmas instrument @xcite in ppak @xcite mode , mounted on the 3.5 m telescope at the calar alto observatory .",
    "the califa survey , sample and data analysis pipeline are described in detail @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the first paper of the califa stellar kinematics series ( falcn - barroso et al . ,",
    "submitted ) where the kinematic map extraction and sample is described in full detail .    in this analysis",
    ", we use the `` useful '' galaxy sample defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b16 ) and the circular velocity measurements obtained therein .",
    "briefly , we start with the initial sample of 277 available stellar velocity fields , 51 of which were not useful for further analysis due to s / n issues ( low number of voronoi bins , foreground contamination ) or extremely distorted velocity fields . the final sample consisted of 226 galaxies .",
    "as shown in , the rejected galaxies were predominantly fainter ( sdss @xmath9 mag ) , which affected the lower completeness limit but did not introduce bias in the sample above it .",
    "we then fit the position and rotation curve parameters by performing markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) modelling of the velocity fields .",
    "the rotation velocity @xmath10 was estimated by evaluating the model rotation velocity at the 80% light radius ( the optical radius ) . due to califa s large but still limited field of view rotation curve extrapolation was necessary for 165 galaxies .",
    "we do not split the galaxy sample into ellipticals and spirals to estimate their @xmath4 values separately . instead , as described in sec .",
    "4.4 of , a correction estimated in @xcite has been applied to all galaxies . @xcite",
    "analyse the relationship between dynamical masses inferred using and axisymmetric jeans anisotropic multi - gaussian ( jam ) models applied to stellar mean velocity and velocity dispersion fields of 18 late - type galaxies observed with the sauron ifs instrument .",
    "we utilise the relation provided in their table 4 and calculate the circular velocities by multiplying the measured velocity by the square root of the factors provided , based on the ratio between the @xmath10 and the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion at the optical radius .",
    "we demonstrate that the obtained circular velocity is comparable with ionised gas rotation velocity in .",
    "we measure the califa stellar circular vf @xmath11 in the same manner as the lfs in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* w14 ) and , estimating the optimal number of velocity bins using scott s rule @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 weights , corrected for cosmic variance as described in are assigned to each galaxy and then used to calculate the vf .",
    "we note that the uncertainties correspond to poissonian errors in each bin only and do not include any uncertainties in circular velocity measurements .        as can be seen in fig.[fig : vcirc_func ] , the high - velocity end of @xmath11 lies significantly above the or hi velocity functions .",
    "this was to be expected since hi surveys are blind to gas - poor massive ellipticals @xcite .",
    "however , the califa vf is below the higher - velocity end of inferred vf for all galaxy types .",
    "this is not surprising given that their vf combines the observed alfalfa vf and the velocity dispersion function of @xcite .",
    "vf is defined for rotation - dominated galaxies only and we do not include the velocity dispersion contribution in any way , barring the circular velocity correction described in sec . [",
    "sec : vel_measurements ] .    at lower velocities",
    "the califa vf starts to fall off rapidly and deviates from the schechter function shape .",
    "we estimate the region where incompleteness should become important , based on the luminosity function of the sample provided in .",
    "we convert the luminosity completeness limits to velocity using the tully - fisher relation measured in and find that the califa vf should be complete within the velocity range of 140 @xmath13 345 km s@xmath1 .",
    "such a direct conversion excludes the scatter in tfr , which causes a fall - off sooner than would be naively expected from the tfr alone . by taking the @xmath14 tfr scatter ( 0.27 mag ) into account",
    ", we find that the califa velocity function , as shown in fig.[fig : vcirc_func ] , can be safely assumed to be complete above 170 km s@xmath1 . at the high velocity end ,",
    "the califa survey is limited by its survey volume as the total number of galaxies brighter than @xmath15 -23 expected within the survey is of the order of unity . given the low number of galaxies at the high velocity end of the tfr , we are unable to estimate the real tfr scatter among the most massive galaxies and the subsequent onset of bias .",
    "however , conservatively adopting the @xmath14 tfr scatter of 0.27 mag we find that the califa vf is complete at least up to 320 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the califa stellar rotation velocity measurements have significant uncertainties , resulting from limited spatial resolution of binned stellar velocity fields , limited califa field of view and pressure - support dependent correction term .",
    "the circular vf is likely affected by all these factors . a broader discussion of uncertainties in the circular velocity measurements and volume correction weights is contained in and .    in order to check the impact of velocity measurement uncertainties we employ a resampling method similar to .",
    "we generate 200 mock califa vf samples ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcirc_func_test ] ) in which the volume weights are not changed , but the velocities @xmath4 are replaced with randomly drawn values such that @xmath16 = @xmath4 + @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the individual velocity uncertainties of each point .",
    "overall , the effect is a smoothing of the vf as the datapoints are smeared into the neighbouring bins .",
    "as the 1/@xmath19 weights are higher at the lower velocities , this leads to an artificial boost at the highest velocity end .",
    "undoubtedly , this effect should be present in our vf as well , making the location of the highest velocity califa datapoint even more uncertain . given that this bin only includes 3 galaxies and is outside our estimated completeness range , we exclude it from all further analysis .      in order to extend the vf to a wider velocity range we merge the hipass vf between 60 - 160 km s@xmath1 and califa circular velocities between 160 - 320 km s@xmath1 , effectively choosing the more complete vf in each bin .",
    "merging the two vfs in this way is justified as hi - rich late - type galaxies dominate the counts below 200 km s@xmath1 . the high mass limit ,",
    "early - type massive rotators contribute significantly to the high velocity end , where the califa sample is expected to be complete at least up to @xmath20 320 km s@xmath1 , as described above .",

    "[ fig : combined_vcirc_func ] .",
    "the datapoints are listed in table [ table : vf_values ] and the fit parameters are provided in table [ table : fit_vf ] .",
    "uncertainties for the hipass values were taken from @xcite , where they supplement direct measurement and shot noise with other uncertainties such as distance errors , cosmology uncertainties and cosmic variance . similarly",
    "to , we find that the model parameters are highly covariant .",
    "+     vf from illustris-1 dark - matter only simulation is shown by a thin dark blue line .",
    "full - physics illustris-1 simulation vfs , calculated using the subhalo @xmath22 and circular velocity at 80% stellar mass radius ( @xmath23 ) are displayed as orange and yellow solid lines respectively .",
    "the lower panel shows the ratio between the baryonic simulated vfs , the combined califa+hipass fit and the dm - only illustris vf . see sec .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : vf_values ]      despite the care with which we have undertaken our analysis , combining the hi rotation velocities and stellar circular rotation velocities as we have done has some caveats .",
    "first of all , the actual methods used to construct the hipass and califa vfs are different . the califa volume correction procedure uses a more straightforward 1/v@xmath24 method @xcite for the radial density variations .",
    "meanwhile , employ a bivariate step - wise maximum likelihood ( 2dswml ) technique to obtain their space densities .",
    "@xcite verify that the method is insensitive to even large radial density variations , the hipass linewidth function ( wf ) matches the wf obtained from the deeper alfalfa survey down to 60 km s@xmath1 , confirming that the effect of large scale structure on the hipass vf is negligible , at least in the range of our analysis .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the 1/v@xmath24 and 2dswml methods yield practically indistinguishable results , confirming that the two vfs derived using both methods are compatible .",
    "the hipass sample consists of late - type galaxies only , since visually classified early - type galaxies , comprising 11% of the sample , have been removed .",
    "however , the fraction of early - type and s0 galaxies is reported to only have a noticeable effect on the vf only for galaxies with rotation velocities above 200 km s@xmath1 , where we use califa vf values already .",
    "hipass linewidths have been corrected for inclination using supercosmos imaging @xmath25-band photometric axis ratios @xcite , while we use kinematic inclinations obtained from mcmc modelling of the 2d velocity fields .",
    "photometric inclination estimates are systematically affected by unknown intrinsic disk thickness , choice of @xmath26 measurement radius and any departure from a perfect circular disk shape .",
    "however , given that exclude galaxies with estimated inclinations @xmath27 45 , inconsistencies in inclination measurements are unlikely to have had a significant effect .",
    "as discussed in , hipass may not detect hi at the flat part of the rotation curve for all galaxies , especially those with @xmath28 60 km s@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , a small fraction of low - mass galaxies might not have enough gas to have been detected by hipass .",
    "we treat the lowest vf end with caution , and exclude hipass datapoints below 60 km s@xmath1 from the combined fit .",
    "therefore , the joint velocity function should be representative in the velocity range of 60 @xmath13 320 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we compare our work with a number of simulations . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined_vcirc_func ] are the vfs from the millennium @xcite and bolshoi @xcite dark matter simulations . here",
    "we are plotting friends - of - friends dm halos using two different halo circular velocity definitions : virial velocity @xmath29 and maximum circular velocity @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we show the illustris-1 dm - only run @xmath22-based vf , constructed for haloes with @xmath30 10@xmath31 .",
    "we also include two vfs measured from illustris-1 full - physics simulations @xcite .",
    "illustris @xmath22 is calculated for all subhaloes with stellar masses @xmath32 10@xmath33 , while illustris @xmath23 is calculated as the gravitational potential - induced circular rotation velocity at the 80% stellar mass radius .",
    "it is strikingly evident that the observed vf does not agree with the dark matter - only simulations , even though the low velocity end of bolshoi and millenium simulations displays marginal agreement with the observational data . at intermediate velocities",
    "the dark matter - only vfs sit well below both the observed data and the baryonic simulation .    however , we find that the observed vf can not be reconciled with the illustris @xmath23 and @xmath22-based vfs , though the full physics simulations produce vfs that are significantly closer to the observed vf .",
    "the lack of observed galaxies is evident for velocities lower than @xmath4 @xmath5 120 km s@xmath1 .",
    "fact was already shown in @xcite and , however , we find it worthy to revisit their results using the latest hydrodynamical simulation results .",
    "interestingly , at the intermediate velocities the predicted vfs are systematically offset from the observations , differing by up to a factor of 3 .",
    "this discrepancy is not related to the `` under - abundance '' problem .",
    "the mismatch between simulations and observations is either a result of an inconsistency in the way that observations and simulations are measuring the velocity function , or the structure of simulated galaxies is inconsistent with the structure of observed galaxies .",
    "we have not yet performed a fully fair comparison between the simulation and observations using the 80% light radius in both cases , employing adequate surface brightness cuts and including projection effects for the simulation . to be a constraint on the future generations of galaxy formation models .",
    "in this work we measure the califa stellar vf , derived from a sample of 226 stellar velocity fields . to our best knowledge ,",
    "it is the first directly measured vf that includes early - type fast rotators as well as late - types .",
    "we then combined this vf with the hipass vf to obtain the first directly measured velocity function that simultaneously covers a wide range of circular velocities and morphological types .",
    "this has the benefit of using the space density and velocity data measured from the same surveys , without assuming scaling relations or conversions between kinematic observables .",
    "the combined vf is complete in the range of 60 @xmath13 320 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we find that illustris simulation vf does not reproduce the observed data in both the low and high velocity ranges .",
    "the differences between @xmath3cdm predictions and the observed vf are not so dissimilar to those found when comparing the halo and stellar mass functions . there",
    ", physical processes important for galaxy formation cause a decoupling of the halo and galaxy growth . by highlighting similar discrepancies , this work opens a new window for comparison with theory that should deepen our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "the resulting velocity function is expected to provide constraints on galaxy assembly and evolution models , insights into baryonic angular momentum , help improve halo occupation distribution and semi - analytic disk formation models .",
