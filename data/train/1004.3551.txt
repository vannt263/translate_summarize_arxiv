    "the presence of many light fields , or moduli , is a common feature of string theory . at late times , the expectation values of these fields determine low energy observables ; hence , their evolution is heavily constraint from the time of nucleosynthesis , although they are expected to be dynamical in the very early universe . for these reasons ,",
    "moduli trapping is an important aspect of inflationary model building in string theory , see @xcite for reviews ; often all but one degree of freedom are stabilized by construction during inflation , but how they stabilize is seldom addressed .",

    "the process of particle production is identical to the one examined in preheating @xcite , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "backreaction of these new states on the moduli can be dramatic : moduli can be trapped @xcite , or , if moduli drive inflation , the inflaton velocity can decrease temporarily @xcite , as in trapped inflation @xcite . a concrete realization of the string higgs effect can be found in a system of parallel @xmath1-branes @xcite , whose separation is a modulus field from the four - dimensional point of view .",
    "if they come close to each other , strings stretching between the branes become massless , gauge symmetries are enhanced and the branes stick to each other due to backreaction  the modulus is trapped . for a small selection of other examples , see @xcite .    in this paper , we examine the consequences of particle production near such extra species loci ( esl ) if the dimensionality of moduli space @xmath1 is large compared to the dimensionality of the locus , @xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : particleproduction ] that trapping is suppressed if the dimensionality of moduli space is larger than the dimensionality of a given locus ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this result is expected , since there is no classical attraction towards esls and it is improbable to run head on into an esl if @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the mere presence of esls does not guarantee a dynamical preference of high symmetry states for moduli @xcite .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : particpleproductionwithimpactparameter ] we show that the presence of many loci with a characteristic inter - esl distance @xmath6 leads to a general speed limit , or terminal velocity , on moduli - space . at strong coupling ,",

    "we derive a speed limit at weak coupling caused by the combined backreaction of particles produced at many esls in the vicinity of the trajectory .",
    "we take a bottom up approach , assuming the viability of low - energy effective field theory and treating the characteristic distance between esls , as well as their dimensionality , as free parameters .",
    "furthermore , we model the additional light degrees of freedom by a massless scalar field that couples to the moduli via interactions of the type @xmath7 , as in @xcite . in this notation",

    "the presence of a terminal velocity offers the opportunity to drive inflation by moduli with hitherto unsuitable potentials .",
    "this type of inflation is a generalization of trapped inflation @xcite , which recently re - surfaced as monodromy inflation @xcite , but with several crucial differences : firstly , particle production at any given esl is minor because esls are not approached too closely , in contrast to the one - dimensional case in @xcite ; there , extra species points ( esps ) are encountered head on and all particle production occurs at a single esp at any given time . secondly , in the large @xmath1 limit the velocity at which the trajectory is traversed is independent of the slope of the potential as long as the slope is steep enough . again , this differs from @xcite , where the slope still determines the speed and observational parameters , such as the scalar spectral index .",
    "we investigate this type of trapped inflation in higher dimensions in sec .",
    "[ sec : trappedinfllarged ] , where we encounter several attractive features : focusing on a model with quadratic potentials for the moduli , more than sixty e - folds of inflation can be achieved with sub - planckian field excursions if @xmath9 is small enough . the inflationary scale is set by the cobe normalization , but the dynamics is not sensitive to the actual shape of the potential as long as a single , reasonably straight classical trajectory with large slope is present .",
    "this is , in a sense , opposite to setups needed for slow - roll inflation , where the potential needs to be shallow over long ranges in field space . as a consequence , the @xmath10-problem",
    "is alleviated .",
    "furthermore , no fine - tuning of the initial speed is needed : if the initial speed is large , particle production is strong , causing strong backreaction and temporary trapping ; after the produced particles are diluted away due to the expansion of the universe , the speed picks up again and the terminal velocity is approached from below . in this sense ,",
    "trapped inflation is an attractor solution .",
    "the ongoing particle production during inflation has several additional observational consequences , sec .",

    "additionally , assume a flat moduli space metric , leading to a straight trajectory .",
    "defining @xmath14 as the effective field along this trajectory , its equation of motion is @xmath15 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time and @xmath16 is the hubble parameter . for a constant equation of state parameter @xmath17",

    "let s consider concrete numbers ; in an inflating universe with @xmath32 the upper bound becomes @xmath33 , less than @xmath34 regardless of the initial velocity .",
    "however , if @xmath35 is closer to @xmath36 , the length of the trajectory can increase above @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , consider a phase dominated by kinetic energy , @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where a small contribution to the total energy density @xmath39 redshifting as @xmath40 ( slower than @xmath41 ) is also present .",
    "@xmath42 takes over at @xmath43 when @xmath44 . using ( [ sincreaseln ] ) and ( [ sincreasebeta ] )",
    ", we get a total path length in the limit @xmath45 of @xmath46 thus , an extended kinetic phase is needed to achieve super - planckian values for @xmath31 . for example , if moduli have an initial planckian kinetic energy ( @xmath47 ) and if they dominate until high - scale slow - roll inflation sets in around @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , we get @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "conceivably , moduli could also dominate after inflation ended i.e.  down to the susy breaking scale @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in summation , if the kinetic energy of the moduli does not dominate the energy density of the universe , the moduli travel a limited stretch in field space until they come to rest due to hubble friction , @xmath55 ; for instance , they do not travel far during inflation or in a radiation / matter dominated universe .. ] if the moduli s kinetic energy dominates , i.e. before a standard high scale inflationary phase or in the interval after inflation but before susy breaking , they can travel farther ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . in the following sections we keep in mind the interval @xmath58      even in the absence of a classical potential",
    ", moduli can be trapped near locations where additional particle species become light .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom are produced quantum mechanically if the field trajectory gets close enough to an extra species locus ( esl ) , and their backreaction can force the trajectory in an orbit around it . since hubble damping in an expanding universe",
    "causes an inward spiraling trajectory , the moduli get trapped .",
    "the origin of the additional light degrees of freedom are often enhanced symmetries at the locus @xcite , so that esl or esp can also denote enhanced symmetry locus or point .",
    "quantum moduli trapping was proposed in @xcite and was recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "a field theoretical description of this phenomenon is identical to the resonant particle production after inflation , usually referred to as preheating @xcite , see i.e.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "our first goal is to estimate a characteristic distance to the esl below which moduli trapping is common .",
    "consider a single esp at the origin where additional light states appear .",
    "we model this situation by introducing an new scalar field @xmath11 coupled to the freely moving moduli via a quadratic interaction @xmath59 without any bare @xmath11 mass , as in @xcite .",
    "classically , @xmath60 along with a straight trajectory in moduli space is a solution . starting with this solution , the trajectory and the esp span a plane in moduli space .",
    "hence , we can redefine the fields so that the straight trajectory takes the simple form @xmath61 where we ignored hubble friction so that @xmath62 .",
    "hence , to discuss the effect of a single esl , the problem reduces to the two dimensional case investigated in @xcite .",
    "efficient particle production in a fourier mode @xmath63 occurs if the non - adiabaticity parameter @xmath64 satisfies @xcite @xmath65 since the effective mass of the @xmath11-field is given by @xmath66 we see that this requirement is satisfied if the @xmath11-field is light .",
    "once @xmath11-particles are produced , they induce a classical confining potential for the moduli , which gets stronger with successive bursts of particle production . evaluating ( [ adiabaticity1 ] ) at the point where the esp is closest , we conclude that trajectories with impact parameters smaller than @xmath67 have a strong chance to get trapped near the esp ( see fig .",
    "[ pic : trapping ] for a schematic ) . the value of @xmath68 , and correspondingly the value of the characteristic impact parameter @xmath69 below which trapping is common , is model dependent . in the case of a higher dimensional",
    "esl the discussion is analogous , with @xmath70 denoting the minimal distance between the straight classical trajectory and the esl . since @xmath71 ,",
    "the value of the characteristic impact parameter decreases drastically once fields slow down .",
    "the actual trapping event is complicated by hubble damping as well as the fragmentation of fields once backreaction becomes important . except in the simplest one - dimensional cases ,",
    "a proper discussion of trapping requires numerical simulations , as in preheating @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we take a binary point of view and assume that the moduli get trapped once they approach an esl to within a distance smaller than @xmath69 ( we go beyond this binary treatment in sec .",
    "[ sec : moduliareinflatons ] ) .",
    "we further treat @xmath69 as a constant ; hence , trapping becomes less likely as @xmath72 decreases due to hubble friction , so that we overestimate @xmath73 by treating @xmath69 as a constant over the whole trajectory . a better estimate could be achieved by integrating a probability density over the trajectory @xmath74 using @xmath75 .",
    "since the latter is model dependent , we will be satisfied with the overestimate caused by treating @xmath76 ( the correction usually introduces factors of order one ) . ] .      as we saw in section [",
    "sec : length ] , hubble damping limits the overall path length to @xmath77 in an expanding universe . if the field trajectory @xmath74 approaches an esl to within the characteristic impact parameter @xmath69 , trapping of the moduli is common , see sec .",
    "[ sec : trapping ] and fig .",
    "[ pic : trapping ] .",
    "we denote the dimensionality of the esl by @xmath2 ( @xmath78 ) , so that @xmath79 corresponds to an esp , @xmath80 to a line , etc .",
    "further , we assume that esls are spread over moduli space with a characteristic distance @xmath6 ( we make this more precise below ) . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the probability of trapping is less than one , provided that the @xmath12 start out at a random initial position and velocity .",
    "our goal is to estimate the dependence of this probability on the ratios @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as well as the scaling with the moduli space s and esls dimensions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . throughout this section ,",
    "we take @xmath84 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : terminalv ] for @xmath85 ) .",
    "we assume that esps are common and distributed over field space with a number density of @xmath86 .",
    "consider a d - dimensional sphere of radius @xmath31 centered at @xmath87 , enclosing the region that the moduli can access , see fig .",
    "[ pic : dimensionalmoduli ] . in this sphere",
    "we find @xmath88 esps that are potentially reachable by @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath89 is the volume of a d - dimensional unit - sphere , and @xmath90 is the gamma - function ( @xmath91 for large @xmath6 ) .",
    "since the majority of the volume in a sphere is close to its surface for large @xmath1 , the distance from @xmath92 to the majority of the accessible esps is given by a distance close to @xmath31 , the radius of the sphere .",
    "thus , we approximate the distance of all esps to the center of the sphere by @xmath31 . a lower bound for the probability of trapping",
    "can then be estimated by the ratio of the sphere s surface blocked by the esps to the total surface area @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the surface area of a d - dimensional unit - sphere , see fig .",
    "[ pic : detail ] for a schematic .",
    "here , we assume that esps are sparse enough to prevent overlapping of blocked regions on the sphere s surface so that our results are only valid for @xmath95 .",
    "further , we take @xmath96 , since the one dimensional case is trivial : the probability of getting trapped is @xmath97 if @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "( [ probesp ] ) is a lower bound , since even a few esps close to the center of the sphere , which we treated as if they where sitting on the surface , can block out a large fraction of the surface .",
    "we come back to this issue in appendix [ sec : volumeargument ] .    with ( [ number ] )",
    "the lower bound on the probability reads @xmath101 in line with expectations based on @xcite , the more esps are within reach , the higher the probability of trapping .",
    "however , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 we see that trapping becomes heavily suppressed for @xmath96 ; thus , for large @xmath1 , the starting point @xmath92 needs to be within close range of an esp , that is within a distance of order @xmath69 or less , to have a reasonable chance to get trapped .",
    "this should be compared to the one dimensional case , where the relevant distance is @xmath82 : the modulus field is likely to be trapped as long as a single esp is within reach .",
    "the suppression @xmath103 has important consequences for vacuum selection on the landscape .",
    "when the notion of quantum moduli trapping near esps was investigated in @xcite , a dynamical selection principle to single out certain vacua associated with additional symmetries on the landscape , as used in @xcite , was a strong motivation .",
    "however , for large @xmath1 we see that @xmath104 needs to start out or be accurately aimed at an esp in order to get trapped near it , hindering this dynamical selection .",
    "this argument remains true for loci of higher dimensions as long as @xmath0 and @xmath81 .",
    "there are many cases where symmetries are enhanced ( and additional light states appear ) not at points , but at loci of higher dimensionality .",
    "we can easily generalize the derivation of the last section to arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "we first assume a distribution of the esls on moduli - space with a characteristic distance @xmath6 , similar to the case of esps ; for example , if @xmath80 , one can visualize the loci as a string network with characteristic inter - string distance @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we can define an analog to the number density in the esp case via @xmath105 , so that the blocked ( by esls ) surface area of the d - dimensional sphere with radius @xmath31 is bigger than @xmath106 .",
    "here we treated all loci as if they were located at the surface of the sphere ( hence , we find again a lower bound for the probability ) and that they are sparse enough to ignore overlapping . as a consequence ,",
    "the trapping probability satisfies @xmath107 for @xmath108 we observe a suppression of the trapping probability @xmath109 . furthermore , @xmath110 as @xmath111 , providing yet another suppression .",
    "see appendix [ sec : examples ] to see how this result applies to two simple examples .",
    "the factor of @xmath112 is absent if we estimate the probability more accurately by means of a volume argument , see appendix [ sec : volumeargument ] , which does not require any artificial shifting of esls , yielding @xmath113 here , @xmath114 depends on the distributions of esls ; for example , the grid - like distribution in appendix [ sec : volumeargument ] leads to ( [ nperp ] ) , @xmath115      during inflation any classical movement of moduli is quickly damped by hubble friction , yet quantum mechanical fluctuations can still cause fields to drift through moduli space given that hubble induced corrections to the moduli s masses are negligible and no classical potential is present . if we follow the field value in a given hubble patch , we can observe a random walk .",
    "hence , one might expect an increased trapping probability , since a random walk is more volume filling that a straight trajectory . since the hausdorff dimension of a random walk is @xmath116 , that is a random walk is area filling , we expect the trapping probability to be slightly less suppressed , @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 . this expectation is correct in appendix [ sec : trappingrandomwalk ] has a different meaning : it is not related to the speed of the fields , but it is set by the distance at which the extra degrees of freedom can be described by a massless scalar in field theory .",
    "however , the scaling @xmath117 is also valid for @xmath119 if a classical trajectory is intertwined on small scales so that it can be approximated by a random walk in @xmath1 dimensions . ] , see appendix [ sec : trappingrandomwalk ] .",
    "we note that if the fields perform a random walk as described in appendix [ a : trappingrw ] , and trapping does occur , then the trapping event has to take place before the last sixty e - folds of inflation ; in that case , our entire hubble patch today lies in a region that was inside the hubble patch at the time of trapping and as a result , the moduli fields have the same value everywhere in our observable universe .",
    "however , we are primarily interested in the limit @xmath0 , leading to a strongly suppressed trapping probability if @xmath102 .",
    "then the mere presence of esls does not guarantee late time values of moduli fields near these locations ; see appendix [ sec : expansioninflation ] for more details .    in section",
    "[ sec : terminalv ] we investigate the case @xmath120 , in which case we expect particle production to be important ; we further allow for a classical potential for the @xmath12 , so that they may be responsible for inflation .",
    "so far , we focused on fields whose potential energy is negligible compared to both , their kinetic energy and @xmath121 ( from here on we set @xmath122 ) .",
    "if the potential energy dominates , a phase of moduli - driven inflation results ( see @xcite for a recent review on inflationary models in string theory ) ; successful moduli trapping goes hand in hand with ( p)reheating , while failed trapping events can still have interesting consequences .    if moduli serve as inflatons , a successful trapping event is unwanted if it occurs during the last sixty e - folds of inflation",
    ". however , failed trapping events during inflation , that is some particle production at an esl , slow down the fields and render steeper potential viable for slow - roll inflation .",
    "this is the idea behind trapped inflation @xcite , recently resurfaced as a special case of single field monodromy inflation @xcite with sub - planckian field excursions .",
    "here , esps are repeatedly encountered by the inflaton as the angular modulus in a string compactification revolves around a periodic direction @xcite , see also @xcite . due to the classical ( smooth ) potential , the inflaton does not get trapped for long ( even though @xmath123 and @xmath79 ) but it slows down until inflation dilutes the produced particles sufficiently and the field picks up speed again . after leaving the esp ,",
    "the produced @xmath11-particles quickly become heavy , re - scatter off the homogeneous inflaton condensate and cause a cascade of inflaton fluctuations in the ir @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations can dominate over the primordial ones and lead to observable signatures @xcite , such as a bump in the power - spectrum for each failed trapping event and potentially large non - gaussianities .",
    "one may wonder if it is conceivable to increase the number of fields in trapped inflation , for as long as each of the inflatons comes close to esls during inflation , the above mentioned effects will be present .      since the probability of getting close enough to esls depends on the type of movement through moduli space ,",
    "we need to discern between three classes of inflation    1 .",
    "fields with a smooth potential . a smooth classical trajectory in field space results , without any tunneling events",
    "an overall smooth potential with small random bumps and dips .",
    "the classical trajectory can be described by a biased random walk ; the overall drift is determined by the averaged potential , while the superimposed brownian motion is caused by scattering events on the bumps , see i.e.  @xcite .",
    "3 .   a potential with prominent valleys and mountains .",
    "the evolution of fields is the result of repeated tunneling / scattering events , not slow - roll , see i.e.  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 and fields roll slowly , as in case one , we expect trapping events to be rare , since @xmath125 from ( [ trappingprobabilityclassical ] ) and @xmath119 from ( [ defmu ] ) .",
    "if the trajectory is intertwined , as in case two , we need to discern between the drift velocity @xmath126 , which is again small , and the velocity along the trajectory @xmath127 .",
    "these two velocities are comparable if small scattering events dominate ; thus , we expect again an absence of moduli trapping if @xmath5 .",
    "however , if @xmath128 , for example due to frequent large angle scattering events , we note that @xmath69 is not suppressed .",
    "the trapping probability of the resulting biased random walk lies between the classical one in ( [ trappingprobabilityclassical ] ) and @xmath129 from ( [ probabilityrandomwalk ] ) . to be concrete ,",
    "if @xmath130 , where @xmath31 is the mean free path between two scattering events ( not @xmath131 ) , @xmath132 is the number of e - folds and @xmath133 is the number of scattering events per e - fold , we may approximate @xmath134 .",
    "on the other hand , if the classical drift is negligible , @xmath135 , we may use @xmath136 .    in case three",
    ", the trajectory is well described by an unbiased random walk so that ( [ probabilityrandomwalk ] ) is applicable .",
    "however , the step width @xmath31 , number of steps per e - fold @xmath133 , and @xmath69 need to be reconsidered , because the trajectory is the result of repeated tunneling / scattering events .    regarding the viability of trapped inflation in the presence of multiple fields , we note that if @xmath137 is applicable , there needs to be a series of closed @xmath138 dimensional esl - hypersurfaces encompassing the origin to which @xmath74 is heading ; since @xmath139 , the trapping probability ( [ trappingprobabilityclassical ] ) is not suppressed , particle production can occur and trapped inflation may commence .",
    "if the fields perform a random walk , the dimensionality of esls can be smaller ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "thus , trapped inflation , as envisioned in @xcite requires esls of dimensionality close to @xmath1 .    however , as we shall see in sec.[sec : terminalv ] , a compelling type of trapped inflation occurs naturally if @xmath1 is large and @xmath141 due to the presence of a terminal velocity , even if @xmath79 .",
    "consider that the field - trajectory encounters a steep region on the landscape , unsuitable for slow - roll inflation .",
    "the classical potential leads to an increasing speed so that @xmath142 becomes large .",

    ", we consider esps only , that is @xmath79 so that it is extremely unlikely to run head on into an esp for large @xmath1 ( a generalization to esls is straightforward as long as @xmath0 ) .",
    "once @xmath141 , the trajectory is bound to come within range of neighboring esps .",
    "for example , if @xmath123 , the inflaton becomes susceptible to @xmath116 esps , one ahead and one behind ; if @xmath1 is large , the trajectory becomes within reach of many esps , of order @xmath143 .    around each of these esps ,",
    "particles are produced ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : particpleproductionwithimpactparameter ] for the computation ) . as the inflatons continue to roll",
    ", there is an increasing number of particles in the wake of the trajectory .. ] as we shall derive below , the effect of each individual esp is small and no actual trapping occurs if @xmath1 is large , but the combined backreaction of all produced particles leads to a resistive force opposite to @xmath144 .",
    "this situation is comparable to that of friction / viscosity in a fluid .    for large @xmath1",
    ", this friction increases sharply once @xmath141 , that is around @xmath145 preventing a further increase in @xmath72 and leading to a terminal velocity @xmath9 on the landscape , primarily determined by the density of esps and the coupling strength between the inflaton condensate and the new light degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath6 and @xmath68 , inflatons could evolve slowly even if the potential is steep .",
    "since no single esp has a strong influence on @xmath104 , we expect the trajectory to be largely unchanged , that is , @xmath146 still follows the potential gradient , but with a maximal speed @xmath147 determined by balancing the drag force , not hubble friction , with the driving force of the potential .",
    "a similar argument can be made for esls as long as @xmath148 .",
    "note that this terminal velocity is present at weak coupling , opposite to the speed limit at strong coupling in @xcite which led to dbi - inflation @xcite .",
    "we conclude that driving inflation on the landscape may not require a flat potential after all .",
    "if esls are ubiquitous , fields evolve slowly due to quantum backreaction .",
    "this type of inflation is a generalization of one - dimensional trapped inflation , with the important difference that no actual trapping occurs .",

    "any bending of the trajectory is enhanced , causing the trajectory to twist and turn .",
    "inflation may still take place , but since the trajectory bends considerably during any given hubble time , isocurvature fluctuations constantly feed into the adiabatic mode , making the power - spectrum less scale invariant and enhancing non - gaussianities . in order to say anything more concrete , we need to specify the classical potential that determines the classical trajectory .",
    "assume that the inflaton potential is smooth on large scales with a constant average gradient in the direction of @xmath177 , but with random small scale bumps and dips on top .",
    "whenever the trajectory encounters a bump it gets disturbed , causing it to find a way around the bump .",
    "the resulting trajectory is reminiscent of the path a meandering river takes flowing down a mountain side , see i.e @xcite for related proposals .",
    "on such a potential , the trajectory encounters many bifurcation junctions : for example , if @xmath325 , the trajectory could go to the left or right of a bump . which way",

    "if we deal with many bumps , the displacement perpendicular to @xmath177 can be described by a random walk , whereas @xmath177 remains dominated by the averaged gradient .",
    "if @xmath326 the probability that trajectories reunite approaches zero , since a random walk is not self intersecting in three or more dimensions .",
    "inflation in such a model is troublesome : at best , the universe is covered by domain walls after inflation if by some miracle in all the different inflationary hubble patches that are observable today inflation terminated and reheating commenced simultaneously to within a fraction of a hubble time , even though the trajectories in each patch are different . without such a miracle , inflation ends at different times , leading to pronounced hot / cold spots in the cmb , that are not observed .    adding esls and backreaction to such a model enhances these problems .",
    "therefore , we do not consider meandering trajectories further .      due to the problems caused by bifurcation junctions , such as domain walls and pronounced hot / cold spots in the cmbr , we would like to shift attention to potentials that channel the trajectory along a single path throughout the last sixty e - folds of inflation .",
    "this means that we would like to investigate potentials that have a positive semidefinite slope in all directions perpendicular to the trajectory , see for example @xcite for a recent proposal of an in - spiraling trajectory in two dimensions .",
    "if we consider models with a clear channel , that is with slopes within the channel walls that are bigger than the slope along the channel , and if the classical trajectory is only curved but not intertwined over length - scales of interest , we expect the effect of backreaction to be still most pronounced in the direction opposite to the velocity .",
    "thus , we still expect the presence of a terminal velocity , as derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : particpleproductionwithimpactparameter ] .",
    "if backreaction alters the trajectory drastically , i.e. by forcing the fields over a channel - wall , viable inflationary models could still result , but little can be said generically .",
    "we leave a numerical investigation of concrete models to future studies .",
    "whether or not moduli get trapped at extra species loci ( esl ) , which are often associated with additional symmetries , has important consequences for selecting vacua on the landscape . if the trajectory in field space comes close to such a locus , particles are produced and backreaction can trap the trajectory . in this paper we gave a simple geometric argument to highlight that this type of moduli trapping is unlikely if the dimensionality of moduli space is considerably larger than the dimensionality of the loci ; for @xmath5 ( or @xmath327 if the trajectory is intertwined ) , the probability of getting trapped is suppressed by @xmath328 ( or @xmath329 if the trajectory is intertwined ) , where @xmath6 the characteristic inter - esl distance , @xmath330 is an effective trapping radius , @xmath72 the velocity in field space , and @xmath68 a coupling constant .",

    "to esls is straightforward ) , we derived a terminal velocity @xmath331 on the landscape : once the speed approaches @xmath9 , the trajectory comes within reach of a plethora of esps at which @xmath11-particles are produced . their combined backreaction acts opposite to the velocity if the classical trajectory is straight over distances covered in a few hubble times ( we allow for a classical potential of the moduli ) . since backreaction increases sharply for @xmath332 if the dimensionality of moduli space is large , @xmath9 acts as a speed limit .",
    "the classical trajectory is followed with this speed as long as the slope along the classical potential is large and the path is reasonably straight .",
    "the presence of a terminal velocity offers the intriguing possibility to drive inflation with potentials that do not otherwise support slow - roll inflation .",

    "for example , if @xmath80 and @xmath337 , we consider a cubic lattice where any given extra species lines intersect with two other extra species lines at right angles after a distance @xmath6 , and one class of lines is parallel to @xmath338 .",
    "such an arrangement is artificial , but it allows for a simple estimate of @xmath137 that provides an approximation for more random distributions of esls that share the same inter - esl distance @xmath6 .",

    "even if the inflaton potential has a global minimum at @xmath249 , it is unlikely that all fields start out in phase and oscillate with the same frequency . because of the generic dephasing of fields , we expect parametric resonance to be negligible if several inflatons couple to the same matter field",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in @xcite analytically at the example of @xmath363-flation , and by means of lattice simulations in @xcite , where it was also shown that for as little as @xmath337 , parametric resonance is heavily suppressed ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "note that the absence of parametric resonance may be desirable : since the reheating temperature is lowered considerably , the overproduction of thermal relics , such as gravitinos @xcite , is avoided .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that tachyonic instabilities , that is explosive particle production caused by yukawa interactions of the inflatons to the matter field ( @xmath366 ) , are left intact if the number of fields is increased .",

    "a walk s shape can be characterized by the radius of gyration tensor , defined as @xcite @xmath386 in analogy to the moment of inertia tensor in classical mechanics . here , @xmath387 is the average over a particular random walk , that is @xmath388 the eigenvalues of ( [ rtensor ] ) , @xmath389 , provide an estimate of the walk s extent in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "one can derive analytic expressions for the ensemble average @xmath390 in a @xmath112-expansion ( which becomes exact in the limit of @xmath194 ) , leading to the radii of gyration @xmath391 up to first order in @xmath112 ( @xmath392 ) .",

    "these errors are consistent with expected corrections of order @xmath400 .    as evident from the radii of gyration in ( [ radiiog ] ) ,",
    "the shape of an individual random walk is far from spherical , since a sphere has @xmath401 for all @xmath394 .",
    "one can quantify the amount of asphericity by @xmath402 a number that is between zero ( a sphere ) and one ( a stick ) . for large @xmath1 ,",
    "the asphericity approaches @xmath403 , indicating that random walks in higher dimensions are neither stick - like , as the classical trajectory , nor spherical , as an average over many random walks .",
    "further , they all `` look '' alike , regardless of the dimensionality d.          a naive guess for the volume sampled by a random walk might be @xmath406 .",
    "however , this does not properly take into account the volume coverage of a random walk ; its fractal dimension , that is its hausdorff dimension , is 2 for all @xmath96 .",
    "thus , a random walk is not volume filling , but it covers an analog of a two dimensional surface with an area of order @xmath407 . since we are interested in cases where the random walk comes to within a distance of order @xmath69 to an esl , we may define an effective volume of ( see fig .",
    "[ pic : sphere ] ) @xmath408 @xmath409 can be used in estimating the trapping probability , see section [ sec : trappingrandomwalk ] .",
    "moduli trapping , and the magnitude of @xmath69 , differ from the process described in section [ sec : trapping ] , since the movement of the random walk is not driven by kinetic energy , but by quantum fluctuations . the description in section [ sec : trapping ]",
    "is based on modeling the trapping event in field theory by the inclusion of a classical field @xmath11 , which acquires a non - zero vev due to explosive particle production once the trajectory in moduli space comes closer than @xmath69 to an esl . in this process ,",
    "part of the kinetic energy in the moduli is transferred to @xmath11 , which then backreacts onto the @xmath12 . however , if the moduli simply drift through moduli space , driven by quantum mechanical fluctuations , this process can not be operational .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a mechanism that can trap moduli : let s denote the distance from an esp after which a field theoretical description with an additional scalar field @xmath11 becomes viable by @xmath410 .",
    "once the trajectory comes closer than @xmath410 to the esp , we also have to consider the effect of quantum mechanical fluctuations on @xmath11 , which increases @xmath411 .",
    "in addition to this quantum mechanical drift , the field is affected by the classical potential @xmath412 since @xmath413 , a classical force driving @xmath11 back to the origin results . to be concrete , if the usual slow - roll approximation for @xmath11 is used , which is justified since we start out at @xmath60 , one finds @xcite a modified diffusion equation for the probability distribution of finding @xmath11 at a nonzero vev , @xmath414 where the last term originates from the classical force on @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to an equation of motion for @xmath415 @xmath416 since @xmath417 , we can integrate the above to @xmath418 after @xmath419 e - folds of inflation , the value of @xmath420 settles into @xmath421 this in turn introduces a classical force onto the moduli @xmath422 , driving them towards the position of the esp . once they get closer to the esp , @xmath11 can drift out further , increasing the classical force on the moduli , etc . in the end , the moduli drift around the esp , while @xmath11 fluctuates around zero , and none of them can escape .",
    "thus , the moduli are trapped near the esp ( a generalization to higher dimensional esls is straightforward ) .",
    "interestingly , the effective trapping radius is given by @xmath423 , which is necessarily bigger than the value in section [ sec : trapping ] , since the arguments in section [ sec : trapping ] are also based on a field theoretical description .",
    "thus , trapping by esls is more efficient for drifting moduli than for classically moving ones .",
    "if @xmath410 is bigger than the expected inter - esl distance @xmath6 , we conclude that moduli are preferably located near esls after inflation , given that inflation lasts sufficiently long so that @xmath424 .",
    "the value of @xmath410 is model dependent ; for example , if the moduli correspond to distances between d - branes and the light extra degrees of freedom correspond to strings stretching between them , then the strings are only light , and can thus be modelled in field theory by @xmath11 , if the branes come to within the fundamental string length .",
    "this in turn determines @xmath410 .              incorporating the increased volume coverage of the random walk leads to a better estimate of the trapping probability .",
    "analogously to appendix [ sec : volumeargument ] , we distribute the esls along a grid .",
    "the total probability is now a sum of four parts , @xmath429 ( all esl directions are perpendicular to @xmath430 and @xmath431 ) , @xmath432 and @xmath433 ( one esl direction is parallel to @xmath430 or @xmath431 , while all other ones are perpendicular ) and @xmath434 ( one direction is parallel to @xmath430 and an other one to @xmath431 ) . each probability is given by the appropriate cross - section of @xmath409 ( such that the esls appear as points in this cross - section ) multiplied with @xmath435 and the number of possible orientations of an esl within this class . since @xmath436 , we can approximate the total probability by @xmath437 .",
    "if esls are distributed along a grid , there are @xmath438 possible orientations perpendicular to both @xmath430 and @xmath431 , and the probability becomes @xmath439 as before , a different distribution of esls would change the pre - factor , but not the general scaling with @xmath83 .",
    "a comparison with ( [ lowerboundprw ] ) reveals an enhancement of @xmath440 , caused by the higher volume coverage of the random walk .",
    "however , for large @xmath441 , we still observe a strong suppression .",
    "we conclude , that moduli trapping at esls in @xmath1 dimensions is expected to be efficient during inflation only if @xmath442 ; for instance , lines can trap efficiently in three dimensions , while points ca nt .",
    "the expression for @xmath443 in ( [ probabilityrandomwalk ] ) is also valid for a classical , intertwined trajectory , that can be approximated by a random walk . in this case",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath132 is still the number of steps ( but not the number of e - folds ) and @xmath159 the step length , all of which need to be determined from the classical trajectory .",
    "if a random walk in moduli space begins in some hubble patch during inflation , @xmath444 identical copies of this hubble patch appear after the first step ( that is after one e - fold ) , and the moduli perform independent random walks in each patch from then on .",
    "consider now a random walk of length @xmath445 .",
    "the volume sampled by a single walk of this length is ( [ volumerw ] ) @xmath446 thus , it would take about @xmath447 independent random walks to cover the entire volume of the d - dimensional sphere of radius @xmath6 . as a consequence , the probability of finding at least one hubble patch where the moduli get trapped at an esl approaches one , if inflation lasted @xmath448 e - folds in addition to the number of e - folds needed to achieve @xmath449 .",
    "thus , one might be tempted to conclude that inflation enhances the chance of being trapped by esls . however ,",
    "this line of thought is flawed : the volume enhancement factor does not prefer esls ; inflation allows for the population of all vacua that are within reach of a random walk , not only those close to an esl .",
    "hence , the presence of esls is irrelevant if arguments to select a vacuum are contingent on this indiscriminatory population of moduli space .",
    "an additional problem with choosing vacua randomly as above is the presence of domain walls at late times : if the fields drift through moduli space during the last sixty e - folds of inflation , different regions of the universe today have distinct values for the moduli - fields . in this section ,",
    "we ignored any classical potential for the @xmath12 , an approximation that may be justified during high scale inflation but certainly not today . as a consequence",
    ", our universe would be filled with domain walls separating regions with different values for the @xmath12 , a setup that is ruled out observationally .",

    "<S> we investigate particle production near extra species loci ( esl ) in a higher dimensional field space and derive a speed limit in moduli space at weak coupling . </S>",

    "<S> once the terminal velocity is approached , particles are produced at a plethora of nearby esls , preventing a further increase in speed via their backreaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to drive inflation at the terminal velocity , providing a generalization of trapped inflation with attractive features : we find that more than sixty e - folds of inflation for sub - planckian excursions in field space are possible if esls are ubiquitous , without fine tuning of initial conditions and less tuned potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a simple , observationally viable model with a slightly red scalar power - spectrum and suppressed gravitational waves ; we comment on the presence of additional observational signatures originating from ir - cascading and individual massive particles . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that moduli - trapping at an esl is suppressed for @xmath0 , hindering dynamical selection of high - symmetry vacua on the landscape based on this mechanism . </S>"
