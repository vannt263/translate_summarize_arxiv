    "<S> we demonstrate that an economical two higgs doublet model can explain the electron and positron excesses in the recent atic and pamela experiments by the three body decays of the dark matter ( dm ) fermions without requiring the fine turning of the couplings and degeneracy of masses . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the mass and lifetime of the decaying dm particle may not be fixed to be around @xmath0  tev and @xmath1  sec , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we note that this model includes a stable dark matter candidate as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed neutrino oscillations  @xcite and evidence for dark matter ( dm )  @xcite imply physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , recently reported pamela  @xcite / atic  @xcite cosmic - ray measurements show the positron / electron excess above the calculated background for the energy of order 100 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these data is consistent with the previous measurements of the high energy electrons and positrons fluxes in the cosmic ray spectrum by ppb - bets  @xcite , heat  @xcite and ams  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the , so - called , pamela / atic ( p / a ) anomaly can be explained by either annihilations or rare decays of dm particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of the dm annihilations requires a boost factor of order @xmath2 to make it consistent with the thermally averaged annihilation cross section obtained from the observed relic density , whereas the analysis of the dm distribution indicates that the most probable boost factor should be of order 10  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the long enough lifetime of the decaying dm is achieved by using either some arbitrary small couplings ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) or large scale suppressions associated with high - dimensional operators at the low energy in the contexts of supersymmetry  @xcite , technicolor  @xcite , hidden gauge boson  @xcite and hidden fermion  @xcite models . in particular , dm decays through three - body channels have been discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this letter , we would like to explain the p / a result by three - body decays of dm fermions in a simple extended two - higgs doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two neutral leptons @xmath3 with the masses @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and second doublet scalar @xmath6 with the mass @xmath7 in addition to the sm particles . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that new particles are odd under a @xmath8 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> note that the same particle content can be used to explain the small neutrino masses with either stable dm  @xcite or leptogenesis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the new majorana mass term and yukawa couplings can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lepton doublet and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the flavor indexes . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the masses of @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> the lifetime of @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dm leptons mass splitting and @xmath18 with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution of electrons / positrons produced in a single three body decay of @xmath15 can be written as @xmath20    we use the same method to calculate the electron / positron flux as that in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> , the med propagation model has been used and the background is represented by solid lines . in the above cases , the lifetime of @xmath15 is of order @xmath1  s , while the values of @xmath51 can be achieved by taking @xmath52 and @xmath53  gev . as seen from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] , the electron energy spectrum is more sensitive to the parameters in the model in contrast the positron fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the p / a anomaly can be explained by the decays of @xmath15 with the mass higher than 1.5  tev . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that for a lighter dm particle , the drop in the electron flux occurs at a lower energy compared to the atic data . in this sense , our mechanism is complementary to the annihilations of the dm fermions with masses below 1  tev , shown in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our model has more freedom in dm masses and lifetimes than the models with dominated two - body decays of dm particles since the drop in the electron flux in our case is determined by @xmath54 rather than ( dm mass)/2 , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the dm lifetime should be only higher than the age of the universe ( @xmath55  s ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for higher @xmath56 , a mass degeneracy is needed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , to have @xmath47  s , we need @xmath57  gev and @xmath58  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding electron energy spectra and positron fractions are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] for the three propagation models of m1 , med and m2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at the energies higher 400  gev the signals are not sensitive to the propagation models </S>",
    "<S> . production mechanisms of the dm leptons in the early universe and the upper bounds on their masses from the @xmath59-rays observations will be considered elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark that future collider bounds on the masses of heavy neutrinos  @xcite are not applicable in this letter due to the @xmath8 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model can be verified by precise measurements of the electron spectrum and positron fraction , since the shapes of the corresponding curves are not very flexible . in particular , future measurements of the positron fraction at energies higher than 100  </S>",
    "<S> gev can be crucial in testing the same origin of the atic and pamela electron and positron excesses .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated a new mechanism to generate the positron / electron excess from the decays of dm leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the observed p / a anomaly can be explained by the three body decay of the neutral lepton @xmath15 with the mass @xmath60  tev and the lifetime @xmath61  </S>",
    "<S> s. one of the advantages of our mechanism is that there are no requirements for the degeneracy of masses and unnaturally small couplings or any other enhancement factors . </S>"
