    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 @xcite and the @xmath1 @xcite heavy quarkonia decays are one of the most interesting laboratories for investigations within the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular these bound states of a heavy quark @xmath2 and its antiparticle @xmath3 have been examined to extract the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath4 at the scale of the heavy quark mass @xmath5 .",
    "early theoretical analyses starting from the calculation of the total rates in leptonic and inclusive hadronic decays @xcite were done in the colour singlet model ( csm ) . it",
    "_ assumes _ the quark - antiquark pair being in the same quantum state @xmath6 on the partonic level as the corresponding quarkonium on the hadronic level .",
    "in particular the @xmath7 pair has to be in a colour singlet state ( @xmath8 ) when it annihilates . as a consequence of this requirement",
    "the underlying partonic process in the radiative decay @xmath9 of a quarkonium @xmath10 in the ground state @xmath11 is the annihilation of the heavy @xmath7 pair into a photon and at least two gluons .",
    "this process was calculated first in @xcite .",
    "great theoretical progress in the understanding of bound states of heavy @xmath7 systems has been achieved by nrqcd ( non - relativistic quantum chromo - dynamics ) @xcite . in this _ theory _ quarkonia decays are factorized into two step processes : the short - distance annihilation of a @xmath7 pair with fixed total spin @xmath12 , orbital angular momentum @xmath13 , and total angular momentum @xmath14 and its preceding long - distance transition into this state . while the partonic subprocess can be calculated perturbatively to definite order in @xmath4 the non - perturbative subprocess @xmath15 + $ ] _ soft degrees of freedom _ is parameterized by nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "they are the nrqcd counterparts of the wave function at the origin in the colour singlet model and give the probability for finding the quark - antiquark pair in the quantum state @xmath16 at the moment of annihilation . in principle the values of these parameters are unknown and must be fitted to experimental data @xcite or computed on the lattice @xcite .",
    "nevertheless nrqcd provides scaling rules which e.g.  predict colour octet matrix elements being suppressed by powers of the non - relativistic velocity @xmath17 with respect to the leading order colour singlet matrix element .",
    "this typical velocity of the heavy ( anti)quark inside the quarkonium simultaneously serves as expansion parameter of the effective field theory . as a result nrqcd describes a decay rate by an infinite sum over matrix elements of four fermion operators with wilson coefficients which on their part are expansions in @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig1](a ) ) a @xmath7 pair in a colour octet state can annihilate into a photon and a single gluon ( cf fig .",

    "another perturbative contribution may become important in the upper endpoint region ( @xmath21 ) of the spectrum .",
    "due to an imperfect cancellation between terms stemming from real and virtual emission of soft gluons one could expect potentially large logarithms @xmath22 to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "a resummation of these logarithms would then give rise to a sudakov suppression @xmath23 .",
    "though an earlier analysis @xcite claimed such a sudakov damping factor in the colour singlet mode a more recent work @xcite predicts such sudakov factors in the colour octet channels only while the logarithms should cancel order by order @xmath4 in the colour singlet mode .",
    "pair : colour singlet contribution ( a ) , colour octet contribution ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "there is a large fragmentation contribution caused by the collinear emission of a photon from a light ( anti)quark in the final state .",
    "examples for such processes are diagrammed in fig .",
    "they have been investigated in @xcite for the colour singlet mode and in @xcite for the colour octet channels .    at the upper endpoint of the spectrum two different sources for non -",
    "perturbative effects exist .",
    "the first one is the phase space effect associated with the hadronization of massless gluons into massive final states .",
    "this effect usually is considered by a parton shower monte carlo thereby generating a non - zero invariant mass for the outgoing gluon(s ) @xcite .",
    "another method based on the introduction of an effective gluon mass @xcite could obtain the appropriate phase space suppression by fitting the values of the effective gluon mass to data of radiative @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite decays independently @xcite .",
    "in this article we concentrate on another non - perturbative effect contributing to the upper endpoint of the spectrum . in this region",
    "nrqcd operators connected to the center - of - mass ( cms ) movement of the @xmath7 pair inside the quarkonium could become significant even though they are subleading in the sense of the naive nrqcd power counting @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite explicitly that the nrqcd velocity expansion breaks down near the endpoint .",
    "the reason for this breakdown is the kinematical enhancement of the cms operators . in the endpoint region",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath25 rather than @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a measure for the distance from the endpoint .",
    "thus the velocity expansion works fine only for photon energies that are significantly further away from the endpoint than @xmath28 .",
    "however , the range of applicability of nrqcd can be extended to higher values for @xmath29 by the resummation of an infinite class of operators into so - called shape functions @xcite .",
    "thereafter the shape function improved spectrum holds up to a resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "the shape function formalism yields different shape functions for the different quantum states @xmath16 of the quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath20 $ ] ) . in the leading colour singlet case",
    "the shape function is nothing else than a _ number _ namely the corresponding nrqcd matrix element . in the colour octet",
    "modes the shape functions are real _ functions _ reflecting the phase space dependence of the soft gluon radiation .",
    "thus the partonic spectrum of the relevant channels @xmath30 which is proportional to @xmath31 is smeared out to a quite broad peak .",
    "as mentioned above their contribution may be as large as the one from the leading order .",
    "if we compare the total rates of the leading colour singlet and a subleading colour octet term we get @xmath32 thus it is worth to model the non - perturbative shape functions to estimate their influence on the photon energy distribution . for the construction of the model we keep close to a model successfully used for shape functions in quarkonium production @xcite . in this case",
    "the shape functions which originally were defined in @xcite have been modeled by soft gluon emission from the final state .",
    "inspired by the success in describing the @xmath0 production in @xmath33 decays and in the photoproduction channel we take over the physically simple picture of radiating off soft gluons from the heavy ( anti)quark .",
    "we will proceed as follows : first we will recapitulate the result of underlying partonic process @xmath20",
    "\\to \\gamma + g$ ] and @xmath20 \\to \\gamma + g + g$ ] for @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "moreover we will show to what extent fragmentation contributions must be taken into account . afterwards the construction and application of our shape function model in the decay mode is given .",
    "finally we discuss the results of the numerical evaluation of the semi - inclusive decay @xmath1(1s ) @xmath36 + _ light hadrons_.",
    "within nrqcd the photon energy spectrum in the semi - inclusive decay @xmath37 of a quarkonium is represented by the operator product expansion @xmath38 \\bra{h } { \\cal o}[n ] \\ket{h } \\,.\\ ] ] here the wilson coefficient @xmath39 $ ] is calculable perturbatively and gives the differential rate @xmath40 in the decay of a @xmath7 pair with quantum numbers @xmath16 into a photon and light hadrons @xmath41 .",

    "the photon does not stem directly from the annihilation of the heavy quark - antiquark pair but from the fragmentation of a gluon or a light ( anti)quark in the final state .",

    "the integration variable @xmath58 indicates the energy of the particle @xmath59 normalized on the heavy quark mass : @xmath60 .",

    "though the fragmentation functions are non - perturbative objects a naive estimate for their order of magnitude is obtained from counting coupling constants and collinear singularities coming up in a perturbative calculation .",
    "for that we look at the subprocesses highlighted by grey boxes in fig .",
    "the coupling of the photon to a light ( anti)quark is proportional to @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "the leading term comes from the kinematic region where the photon and the ( anti)quark are collinear .",

    "the sum in ( [ dgamdzfrag ] ) runs not only over the gluon but also over different ( anti)quark flavours @xmath179 where we additionally assume @xmath180 .",

    "one recognizes that fragmentation contributions are non - negligible for small photon energies only . in the region",
    "@xmath194 they are mainly dominated by the @xmath195 channel .",
    "though this channel is connected with the fragmentation function @xmath196 which diverges for @xmath197 its numerical contribution to the spectrum for large values of @xmath24 is negligible .",
    "this matches to our expectation that fragmentation processes prefer to transfer small energy fractions from the gluon ( quark ) to the photon .",
    "the upper endpoint region @xmath198 is dominated by direct colour octet contributions ( at least in leading order @xmath4 ) . while the partonic result is proportional to @xmath199 the soft gluon radiation in the initial state smears out the delta peak and also shifts its maximum to @xmath200 .",
    "the higher the model parameter @xmath201 is the smaller is @xmath202 and therewith the effective heavy quark mass and the broader is the width of the peak . comparing the integrated rates of the direct colour singlet mode @xmath203 and the direct colour octet ones we realize that their contributions are almost equal",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the suppression factor @xmath204 of the colour octet modes is canceled by an additional factor @xmath205 in the colour singlet mode ( cf equation ( [ rough ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore one have to consider that there are contributions from many colour octet modes ( @xmath206 and @xmath48 ) but only from one colour singlet mode ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "let us finally concentrate on the region of middle high photon energies . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the part between @xmath208 is the cleanest one of the spectrum . here",
    "the colour singlet contribution which is assumed to be dominating over the whole photon energy range in the colour singlet model can be extracted within shape function improved nrqcd without any pollution from other channels .",
    "this is still true after including the next - to - leading order contributions : while the colour singlet corrections steepen the slope @xcite the colour octet terms are negligible for @xmath208 @xcite .",

    "the spectrum predicted by the colour singlet model ( direct + fragmentation , without any hadronization model ) is indicated by the dash - dotted curvature.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    since the extraction of @xmath209 needs an extrapolation of the measured spectrum towards @xmath210 , a complete theoretical understanding of the part of the spectrum the fit is based on is indispensable to reach an accurate value for the strong coupling constant . in our opinion",
    "this is not possible for high photon energies . to illustrate the problems in the upper endpoint region we smear out our theoretical result with the energy resolution of the cleo detector @xmath211 and fit it to their most recent data @xcite for @xmath212 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "while the spectrum is described satisfactorily within the fragmentation uncertainties for small and middle high values of @xmath24 the discrepancy between theory and experiment is overwhelming for @xmath213 .",
    "as shown by the cleo collaboration @xcite the csm result combined with the fragmentation contributions according to @xcite can be brought into agreement with data using a hadronization model by field @xcite even though the consequential value of @xmath209 is slightly to small compared to the one measured on the @xmath214 resonance .",
    "although the colour octet contributions in fig .  [ fig5 ] have not been suppressed by a hadronization model yet , they seem to be in strong contradiction to the experimental observation . the simplest explanation for this deviation would be an extreme smallness of the colour octet nrqcd decay matrix elements even smaller than the @xmath215 suppression still acknowledged by the power counting rules .",
    "some hints for such small colour octet decay matrix elements also come from the estimation of the @xmath4 corrections @xcite .",
    "furthermore a recent analysis of the corresponding production matrix elements @xcite yielded smaller values than predicted by velocity scaling rules , too .",
    "although the crossing symmetry between these production matrix elements and the ones of the decay holds only in leading order perturbation theory this could also be interpreted as indication for somehow suppressed ( or even negative ? )",
    "values of the nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "nevertheless the understanding of the upper endpoint region in the radiative decay of the @xmath1(1s ) is not good enough to conclude convincingly that the colour octet matrix elements are extremely small . without having investigated the sudakov corrections on the colour octet contributions and without a better understanding of the hadronization process it seems impossible to give a stringent theoretical prediction for @xmath213 .",
    "furthermore the experimental investigation of this spectrum suffers from large systematic problems in this kinematical regime , too .    in summary",
    "an extraction of a precise value for the strong coupling constant from the radiative @xmath1 decay seems to be impossible as long the upper endpoint region is included in the fit .",
    "unless both theoretical and experimental progress concerning the physics in the upper endpoint region is achieved @xmath209 should be fitted from the data between @xmath212 only .",
