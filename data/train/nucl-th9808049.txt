    "the study of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision explores an opportunity to verify the possible occurrence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter   @xcite . in order to detect this exotic phenomenon ,",
    "various signals have been proposed . among them ,",
    "photons and dileptons have long been considered as excellent probes of the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "they are the only signals emitted by the quark gluon phase that reach the detector directly without being affected by final state interaction . as a result",
    ", their detection would provide valuable and reliable information about the moment of their formation .",
    "one would like to understand several aspects of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions , viz .",
    ", how does the initial partonic system evolve and how quickly does it attain kinetic equilibrium ? how quickly ,",
    "if at all , does it attain chemical equilibrium ? and finally , how can we uncover the history of this evolution by studying the spectra of the produced particles , many of which may decouple from the interacting system only towards the end ? these and",
    "related questions have been actively debated in recent times .",
    "thus , it is believed by now that the large initial parton density may force many collisions among the partons in a very short time and lead to a kinetic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the question of chemical equilibration  @xcite is more involved , as it depends on the time available to the system .",
    "if the time available is too short ( 35 fm / c ) , as at the energies ( @xmath2 gev / nucleon ) accessible at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , the qgp will end its journey far away from chemical equilibrium . at the energies ( @xmath3 tev / nucleon ) that will be achieved at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "this time could be large ( more than 10 fm/@xmath4 ) , driving the system very close to chemical equilibration  @xcite , if there is only a longitudinal expansion .",
    "however , this time is also large enough to enable a rarefaction wave from the surface of the plasma to propagate to the center ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the transverse nuclear dimension and @xmath7 is the speed of sound ) , thus introducing large transverse velocity ( gradients ) in the system .",
    "the large transverse velocities may impede the chemical equilibration by introducing a faster cooling .",
    "the large velocity gradients may drive the system away from chemical equilibration by introducing an additional source of depletion of the number of partons  @xcite in a given fluid element .",
    "dileptons and photons are however produced at every stage of the collision and in an expanding system their number is obtained by an integration over the four - volume of the interaction zone . at very early times",
    "the temperature is rather high and we have a copious production of large transverse momentum photons , and large mass dileptons .",
    "this should give us a reliable information about the initial stages of the plasma .",
    "however , the transverse flow of the system is moderate at early times , and their production will only be marginally affected by the flow . by the time",
    "the flow and the other aspects of qgp develop , the temperature would have dropped considerably and we have a large production of low transverse momentum photons and low mass dileptons as well .",
    "however they will have , in addition to the contributions from the plasma , a large contribution from hadronic reactions .",
    "we shall be required to understand them in detail before we can confidently embark upon the task of deciphering the more involved development of the qgp , as it cools ( see , e.g.,ref ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the soft photons and low mass dileptons , mostly produced at later stages when the system is expected to be affected strongly by transverse flow , can provide reliable and useful information about the later stage of the interaction zone . as a consequence ,",
    "this soft region has been suggested as a possible window for obtaining imprints about the flow .",
    "obviously , the precise location of this window is determined by the initial conditions of the plasma and the dynamics of the space time evolution .",
    "we may also add that recent data from ceres experiment @xcite at cern sps for the @xmath8 system show a strong excess in the dielectron yield compared to @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems below the @xmath11 mass .",
    "this result has already been motivated a lot of systematic studies in this mass region @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that bremsstrahlung processes mainly contribute at low masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the description of the ceres data will improve to some extent , when one adds hadronic bremsstrahlung contribution .",
    "for a _ fully equilibrated plasma _ , the production of low mass dileptons and soft photons due to bremsstrahlung process has been studied in great detail in the literature @xcite . however , in the recently formulated self - screened parton cascade ( sspc ) model  @xcite early hard scattering produce a medium which screens the long range color fields associated with softer interactions .",
    "when two heavy nuclei collide at sufficiently high energy , the screening occurs on the length scale where perturbative qcd still applies . this approach yields predictions for the initial conditions of the forming qgp without the need of any _ ad - hoc _ virtuality and momentum cut - off parameters .",
    "these calculation also show that the qgp likely to be formed in rhic and lhc energies could be hot and initially far away from chemical equilibrium . with passage of time , chemical reactions among the partons will push it towards chemical equilibration initially , but the large transverse velocity gradient drives the system away from chemical equilibration  @xcite .",
    "it is quite evident that signals which are emitted at qgp phase would somehow reflect the state of non - equilibration at the time of the phase transition .    in the present work",
    ", we mainly concentrate on a region of low mass dileptons ( @xmath12 gev ) and soft photon ( @xmath13 gev ) production due to bremsstrahlung in a more complete manner , @xmath14 , in a chemically equilibrating and transversely expanding quark - gluon plasma . since the energies of the electromagnetic radiations are low enough , we obtain the production of low mass dileptons and soft photons from bremsstrahlung processes within a soft photon approximation @xcite .",
    "the goal of this approximation is to separate the process of electromagnetic radiation from the strong interaction components .",
    "one also neglects the four momentum of photon in the @xmath15-function , which could be compensated by inserting a phase - space correction factor ( see below ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that in a recent calculation aurenche et al .",
    "@xcite have also calculated bremsstrahlung of soft photons ( real and virtual ) in the frame work of effective perturbative expansion based on resummation of hard thermal loops ( htl ) .",
    "they demonstrated that bremsstrahlung appears only on the two - loop level when the exchange gluon is space like , and its contribution is of same order as that of one - loop .",
    "since the exchanged gluon is space - like , it manifests itself in the rate to the square of the thermal gluon mass ( @xmath16 ) , in contrast to the one - loop result where only the thermal quark mass appears  @xcite . for virtual photons",
    "this result is of the same order in coupling constant , but it can differ quantatively because of the gluon mass . on the other hand , for real photon bremsstrahlung",
    "a factor ( @xmath17 ) arises due to collinear singularities associated with fermionic propagator caused by the vanishing photon mass in the external line of the vacuum polarization diagrams in the two loops .",
    "this is compensated by the factor @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) which leaves the two - loop bremsstrahlung contribution for real soft photon at the same order in @xmath20 as that of one - loop .",
    "we shall come back to this aspect later .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec.ii , we briefly recall hydrodynamic and chemical evolution of the plasma in a transverse direction",
    ". in sec.iii we present the formulation for bremsstrahlung production of soft photon and low mass dileptons in a chemically equilibrating and transversely expanding plasma .",
    "we discuss our results in sec.iv . finally in sec.v",
    ", we give a brief summary .",
    "we assume that kinetic equilibrium has been achieved when the momenta of partons become locally isotropic . at the collider energies",
    "it has been estimated that , @xmath21 fm/@xmath4  @xcite . beyond this point ,",
    "further expansion is described by hydrodynamic equations and the chemical equilibration is governed by a set of master equations which are driven by the two - body reactions ( @xmath22 ) and gluon multiplication and its inverse process , gluon fusion ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the other ( elastic ) scatterings help maintain thermal equilibrium .",
    "the hot matter continues to expand and cools due to expansion and chemical equilibration .",
    "we shall somewhat arbitrarily terminate the evolution once the energy density reaches some critical value ( here taken as @xmath24 gev/@xmath25 @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion of the system is described by the equation for conservation of energy and momentum of an ideal fluid : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy density and @xmath28 is the pressure measured in the frame comoving with the fluid .",
    "the four - velocity vector @xmath29 of the fluid satisfies the constraint @xmath30 . for a partially equilibrating plasma the distribution functions for gluons and quarks",
    "are assumed @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the be ( fd ) distributions for gluons ( quarks ) , and @xmath33 is the fugacity for parton species @xmath34 , which describes the deviation from chemical equilibrium .",
    "this fugacity factor takes into account undersaturation of parton phase space density , @xmath14 , @xmath35 .",
    "the equation of state for a partially equilibrated plasma of massless particles can be written as @xcite @xmath36 t^4 \\ , , \\label{eos}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the number of dynamical quark flavors .",
    "now , the density of an equilibrating partonic system can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the equilibrium density for the parton species @xmath42 : @xmath43 @xmath44 we further assume that @xmath45 .",
    "the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) implies the speed of sound @xmath46 .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations ( [ hydro ] ) with the assumption that the system undergoes a boost invariant longitudinal expansion along the @xmath47-axis and a cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion @xcite .",
    "it is then sufficient to solve the problem for @xmath48 , because of the assumption of boost invariance .",
    "the master equations @xcite for the dominant chemical reactions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 in an obvious notation . in case of transverse expansion",
    ", the master equations can be shown @xcite to lead to partial differential equations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transverse velocity and @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath56 related to the rates appearing in ( [ master1 ] ) are given by , @xmath57 where the color debye screening and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect suppressing the induced gluon radiation have been taken into account , explicitly .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations ( [ hydro ] ) are solved numerically , with the initial conditions obtained from the sspc model @xcite , to get @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which serve as input into the equations ( [ master ] ) for the fugacities ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the convenience of reader , we plot the different parton fugacities in figs.(1 - 2 ) for a transversely expanding plasma likely to be produced in rhic and lhc collider energies . in the figures",
    "@xmath60 denotes the time .",
    "= 3.25 in 0.10 in = 3.25 in 0.10 in    one can see that the quark fugacities always lag the gluon fugacities ( see figs.1 and 2 ) .",
    "this is obvious as sspc model predicts the gluon dominated plasma . at both",
    "the energies the fugacities initially increase with time ( denoted by @xmath60 ) , then start decreasing because by then the transverse expansion has set in ( @xmath53 is non - zero ) .",
    "thus the region where the transverse velocity is large ( later time ) , the plasma ends it journey farther away from chemical equilibrium .",
    "the reason is the velocity gradient causes a depletion in the partons number in the fluid element , which could not be made up by the number of partons produced due to parton chemistry  @xcite , resulting in a decrease of the parton fugacities .",
    "the chemical equilibration can not be achieved at rhic as the life time ( 3 - 4 fm/@xmath4 ) is too small .",
    "due to the longer life time of the plasma phase at lhc energies ( 12 fm/@xmath4 ) , the effects of the transverse expansion are more dramatic , and the entire matter participate in the flow .",
    "there is a possibility of approaching chemical equilibration at lhc energies , and goes far away from it as velocity gradient is substantial .",
    "= 3.25 in 0.10 in = 3.25 in 0.10 in",
    "in this section we wish to outline the rate of production of real and virtual photon due to bremsstrahlung in an chemically equilibrating plasma from the following reactions : @xmath61 one can write the matrix element for this processes as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the matrix element for @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the real(virtual ) photon current @xcite .",
    "using kinetic theory one can write down the rate of production of a photon per unit time per unit volume at a temperature @xmath66 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the color and spin appropriate for the reactions in ( [ reaction ] ) .",

    "this one needs to insert a phase space correction factor @xmath71 , defined as the ratio of three - body phase space to two - body phase space .",
    "this can be obtained  @xcite as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 for real photon and @xmath75 for dileptons in the case of equal mass scattering ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "taking into account the non - equilibrium nature of the plasma , the phase space correction , and also inserting @xmath78 , the dilepton transverse mass spectrum yield due to bremsstrahlung of a virtual photon ( @xmath79 ) in the quark phase is obtained from ( [ rate ] ) as @xmath80   \\phi(s , s_2,m_a^2,m_b^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left ( e\\frac{d\\sigma_{ab\\rightarrow cd}^{l^+l^-}}{dm^2d^3q}\\right ) , \\label{dilepton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",

    "the @xmath90 is defined as @xmath91    the corresponding result for the transverse mass distribution of dileptons from the equilibrating plasma , due to the annihilation process , is given @xcite by @xmath92 we would also like to point out that we consider the soft dilepton production in the low invariant mass region ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "there are many sources of dilepton in this mass range .",
    "if quark - gluon plasma is formed , there will be @xmath94 annihilation and @xmath95 scattering with virtual bremsstrahlung .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the case of low mass pairs the perturbative @xmath96-correction can be larger than the @xmath94 annihilation spectra , which has been calculated in the born approximation .",
    "so , we consider this @xmath94 annihilation spectra as a lower limit and compare our result with it",
    ".    the yield of soft photons produced from bremsstrahlung process , @xmath97 in an equilibrating plasma can also be obtained from ( [ rate ] ) as @xmath98   \\phi(s , s_2,m_a^2,m_b^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times &   \\left ( q_0\\frac{d\\sigma_{ab\\rightarrow cd}^{\\gamma}}{d^3q}\\right ) , \\label{photon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 .",
    "the cross - section for the emission of a soft real photon is @xmath100 where @xmath90 is defined as before ( [ txs ] ) with @xmath65 replaced by the real photon current  @xcite .",
    "the photon production due to annihilation ( @xmath101 ) and compton ( @xmath102 ) processes in qgp have already been studied in fair detail by number of authors  @xcite , in which thermal masses have been used to shield the singularities in the scattering cross - section .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that this is equivalent to using the resummation method of braaten and pisarski  @xcite to regulate the divergences of the qcd rates for these processes . in the following",
    "we shall use the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for a chemically equilibrating plasma for comparison :    @xmath103 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\lambda_q \\lambda_g \\left(1 - \\lambda_q \\right ) \\big[1 - 2 \\gamma + 2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4et}{k^2_c}\\right ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\lambda_q \\lambda_q \\left(1 - \\lambda_g \\right ) \\bigl[-2 - 2 \\gamma + 2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4et}{k^2_c}\\right ) \\bigr ] \\bigr ] \\ , \\label{traxler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to make a comparison of our calculation with that of using htl  @xcite at the two loops level , we would like to discuss the following points . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the htl calculation leads also to a separation in two factors : the amplitude square of the scattering process without photon emission , and a factor which is nothing but the square of an electromagnetic current responsible for photon emission .",
    "now one can easily convince oneself that this essentially amounts to the soft photon approximation we have used in our calculation .",
    "this can also be seen  @xcite quantatively when one compares the bremsstrahlung production of a soft virtual photon in the htl calculation with that of the semi - classical approximation by cleymans et al  @xcite .",
    "the semi - classical result agrees with the htl result in its functional dependence but over - estimates the rate of production by @xmath104 .",
    "this difference appears to be due to several simplifying assumptions made in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) the photon momentum compared to the momenta of the constituents in the plasma has been neglected , but no phase space correction factor has been included .",
    "it has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the result grossly over - estimates without the phase space correction ; ( 2 ) the approximate electromagnetic current has been used ; ( 3 ) also simply a factor unity in the exit channel has been assigned instead of considering the appropriate statistical factors . with proper inclusion , like in the present calculation , of these factors should lead to an agreement with the thermal field theory result .",
    "however , the contribution obtained in htl using two loops is rather large compared to that in one loop  @xcite , though both are of the same order in the coupling constant .",
    "the real photon production in a qgp within the two loops using htl  @xcite are also of the same order in the coupling constant as that of one - loop but there is quantative difference corresponding to different physical processes .",
    "the bremsstrahlung process in two loops gives a contribution which is similar in magnitude to the compton and annihilation contributions evaluated up to the order of one loop  @xcite . in two loops there is also an entirely new mechanism for the production of hard photon through the annihilation of an off - mass shell quark and antiquark , where the off - mass shell quark is a product of the scattering with another quark or gluon .",
    "the contribution from this process completely dominates the emission of hard photons as energy increases , and it is higher by more than one order of magnitude for large energies  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has also been shown that at the energy regime in which we are interested the bremsstrahlung from soft approximation is little higher than that from two loops , but the contribution from soft approximation falls off rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "the parton fugacities for an expanding plasma are displayed in figs.(1 - 2 ) in sec.ii with initial conditions obtained from sspc model  @xcite .",
    "one can see that our results for the nonequilibrium soft photon  ( [ photon ] ) and low mass dileptons  ( [ dilepton ] ) due to bremsstrahlung differ from that of equilibrium rates .",
    "we would like to point out here that we can not make a comparison of nonequilibrium results with that of equilibrium one as the present study is intended for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the sspc model  @xcite predicts that the qgp likely to be formed in this energies will be far away from chemical equilibrium . in view of this , comparing the nonequilibrium results with that of equilibrium one will also be far away from reality .",
    "however , a close inspection suggests that our results are , indeed , quite different .    in fig .  3",
    ", we give our results for the transverse mass distribution of low mass dileptons due to the bremsstrahlung process ( solid curves ) for @xmath105 0.1 gev , 0.3 gev and 0.5 gev , respectively , at both rhic and lhc energies for an equilibrating plasma .",
    "we have also given the contribution from quark - antiquark annihilation process ( dashed curve ) for a comparison .",
    "we see that the annihilation contribution is essentially the same for @xmath105 0.1 gev , 0.3 gev , and 0.5 gev , thus representing a single curve in this figure .",
    "this is due to the fact that at @xmath106 below the @xmath11 mass the transverse mass distribution ( see eq.([trandis ] ) ) has a very weak dependence on @xmath106 .",
    "but on the other hand it has a substantive dependence on the transverse mass @xmath87 and thus shows @xmath87 scaling @xcite .",
    "this scaling is broken when we take into account the bremsstrahlung contribution from the qgp sector .",
    "we now see that in the region @xmath107 gev , the bremsstrahlung contribution out - shine the annihilation contribution at all @xmath87 , while at @xmath108 gev , the distribution is dominated by the annihilation contribution with increasing available energy and invariant mass .",
    "this is because of the fact that quark fugacities are seen to lag behind the gluon fugacities at all time and all radial distances .",
    "since our entire study is based on the description where the plasma as initially produced is gluon rich , the yield would be dominated by the quark - gluon bremsstrahlung . in this context , we see that the relative importance of bremsstrahlung contribution increases quite considerably for a chemically non - equilibrium plasma .",
    "= 3.25 in 0.2 in    we also plot the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons produced from bremsstrahlung ( solid curve ) and annihilation ( dashed curve ) processes in fig .  4 .",
    "at @xmath109 gev , the bremsstrahlung process is seen to play the dominant role at both rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we find that the low mass dilepton yield increases by a factor of 20 as we go from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "= 3.25 in 0.2 in    figure 5 shows the transverse momentum distribution of soft photons at rhic and lhc energies for an equilibrating plasma .",
    "we find that the contribution of the bremsstrahlung process ( solid curve ) dominates over that of compton and annihilation process ( dashed curve ) up to @xmath110 gev at rhic energy and at lhc energy , this dominance exists for @xmath111 gev , after which they fall rapidly .",
    "we envisage an increase by a factor of almost 10 in the soft - photon yield as we move from rhic to lhc energies . for the low @xmath112 regime",
    ", the photon rate has a substantial contribution from bremsstrahlung process whereas in the high @xmath112 regime it is due to the hard processes ( compton and annihilation ) . as discussed already it will really be very interesting to study the production of single photons from qgp using the two loops results of aurenche et al  @xcite along with the one - loop contribution in a chemically equilibrating plasma , since it has been suggested  @xcite that a chemically equilibrated plasma is likely to be produced in rhic and lhc energies with a fairly large temperature .",
    "this indicates that qgp likely to be produced at those energies will have a larger life time , and most likely the photons from the quark matter with the new rates  @xcite may out - shine the photons from hadronic matter .",
    "= 3.25 in 0.2 in",
    "in summary , we have studied low mass dileptons and soft photons production due to bremsstrahlung process at both rhic and lhc energies from an equilibrating and transversely expanding quark- gluon plasma .",
    "we have chosen initial conditions from sspc model in which the system is assumed to be in kinetic equilibrium at the proper time @xmath113 fm / c but far away from chemical equilibrium @xcite . in the present study , we restrict ourselves to photons and dileptons having energies larger than @xmath114 mev so that the landau pomeranchuk suppression @xcite may not be substantial there . for dileptons , the bremsstrahlung contribution is seen to dominate up to @xmath0 gev and for photons this dominance exists for @xmath1 gev .",
    "we also find an increase by a factor of 15 - 20 in the low mass dilepton and soft photon yield as we go from rhic to lhc energies where the life - time of plasma phase is expected to be large",
