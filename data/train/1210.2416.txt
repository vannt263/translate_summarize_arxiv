    "if the particle of mass @xmath4  gev recently discovered  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) turns out ( as is widely expected ) to be the higgs scalar , then particle physics will have at last undeniably moved into the beyond - standard model ( bsm ) era .",
    "the theoretical difficulties of a universe in which the standard model ( sm ) is the ultimate theory of particle physics are well known : in addition to requiring three complete generations of fermions , and ignoring gravity but nevertheless incorporating three distinct fundamental interactions , the sm suffers from the famous hierarchy problem of a scalar particle whose renormalized mass lies quite close to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , rather than being driven to gut- or planck - scale values by the exigencies of regularizing a quadratic divergence .",
    "the most popular bsm remedies for the hierarchy problem are also well known : low - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) , large extra spacetime dimensions , and little higgs models . as the lhc continues to generate vast amounts of new experimental data",
    ", the constraints of phenomenological viability are pushing each approach into ever smaller regions of its respective parameter space .",
    "the moment of truth for many bsm models is rapidly approaching .",
    "the same can be said for a less well - studied approach , the lee - wick standard model ( lwsm ) of grinstein , oconnell , and wise  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the lee and wick ( lw ) program  @xcite of performing renormalization by promoting the spurious pauli - villars regulator to the status of a full , dynamical , negative - norm field , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that introducing lw partners for sm particles with the same gauge couplings eliminates quadratic divergences in loop calculations .",
    "the cancellation between positive- and negative - norm states in loops resembles the cancellation between fermions and bosons in susy , while the fact that the particle and its lw partner share the same statistics but carry an opposite type of parity is reminiscent of the bottom of a tower of kaluza - klein excitations in extra - dimension models .",
    "the latter analogy becomes more apparent when one realizes that lw models need not terminate with a single partner .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lw lagrangian is equivalent to a particular higher - derivative ( hd ) theory ; in particular , it is one in which 4-derivative bosonic and 3-derivative fermionic interaction terms appear , and the full hd field consists of both the conventional field and its lw partner",
    ". of course , not just any hd lagrangian produces an equivalent lw theory ; only those that produce propagator poles at real mass values are valid for the purpose . labeling theories by @xmath5 , the number of poles in the hd field propagator , the conventional single - pole theory is labeled as @xmath6 , and the original lw theory is labeled as @xmath0 , but in principle nothing prevents the construction of @xmath7 theories  @xcite . in such theories , one can show that the partner states alternate in norm as their mass parameters increase .",
    "the cancellation of quadratic divergences requires the participation of all @xmath5 states through delicate sum rules among their couplings that seem conspiratorial at the level of the lw theory , but merely reflect the improved power counting of the equivalent hd theory .",
    "while not as thoroughly studied as other bsm approaches , the original lwsm approach  @xcite has nevertheless inspired research leading to numerous publications in several different areas , including early universe models , quantum gravity , thermodynamics , and formal studies of field theory .",
    "the last of these deserves special mention because negative - norm states in field theory are peculiar objects .",
    "as has been known for decades  @xcite , the apparent violation of unitarity induced by such states can be traded for the imposition of future boundary conditions that introduce causality violation at microscopic levels . to date",
    ", no logical argument precludes the existence of such exotic behavior , and the existence of microcausality violation can only be bounded experimentally by measurements at successively higher energy scales .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we avoid such thorny issues and adopt instead the pragmatic viewpoint that lw theories ( or their hd equivalents ) should merely be treated as effective theories good to scales of at least 14  tev , the upper limit of physics to be probed at the lhc in the near future .",
    "the question of the viability of lwsm variants then relies upon whether the new states can be produced and observed directly , and for what mass ranges they satisfy the stringent experimental constraints imposed by electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) .",
    "both of these questions have been studied in some detail in the original @xmath0 lwsm ; in the case of direct production , refs .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath0 lw gauge bosons , for example , can readily be produced at the lhc , but may be difficult to distinguish from novel states from other scenarios such as extra - dimension models .",
    "precision observables in the @xmath0 theory , on the other hand , have been examined in a succession of improvements  @xcite ( by scanning the lw parameter space in  @xcite ; by including only lw masses for the fields most important for the hierarchy problem  @xcite ; by using not just oblique parameters @xmath8 , @xmath2 , but also the `` post - lep '' parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10  @xcite ; by including bounds from the @xmath11 direct correction  @xcite ) , with the consensus conclusion that lw gauge boson masses must be well over @xmath12  tev , and in such cases , the lw fermion masses must be substantially higher ( perhaps as much as 10  tev ) .",
    "if all lw masses are comparable , then the lower bound on this scale is typically @xmath13  tev .",
    "the lw higgs partners , on the other hand , appear to be much less tightly constrained and produce milder constraints on collider phenomenology  @xcite .    in comparison ,",
    "only one collider physics study of the @xmath1 lwsm has thus far appeared  @xcite , a paper by the present authors generalizing the study of @xmath9 boson production in ref .",
    "@xcite , and showing not only that such bosons can readily be produced , but also that their mass spectrum generates a signature likely unique among known bsm models .",
    "the next logical step is , of course , a study of ewpt in the @xmath1 lwsm , which is the purpose of this paper .    on general principles ,",
    "one naturally expects the @xmath1 lwsm to allow for less stringent lower bounds on new particle masses compared to the @xmath0 model , making for earlier discovery potential at the lhc .",
    "of course , simply by adding new degrees of freedom to the theory ( extending from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) and then fitting to ewpt , one expects the bounds to relax ; however , in lw models , one might expect the effect to be more pronounced because the negative - norm states and the new positive - norm states can produce a substantial numerical cancellation just between themselves ( although the sm state must also be included in order to cancel the quadratic divergences ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 lwsm may be thought of as an @xmath1 model in which the masses of the negative - norm states are fixed and the masses of the additional positive - norm states are taken to infinity , one expects a substantial relaxation of tension in ewpt compared to the @xmath0 lwsm when the positive - norm masses are adjusted to lie not excessively higher than the negative - norm masses . in detailed fits , we find that this reasoning holds up to scrutiny in the scalar sector , while the addition of @xmath1 fermions generates much more nuanced changes , sometimes even moving in the same direction as the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "after a detailed analysis , one finds that a large parameter space of lhc - accessible masses remains open to lw partner states , making the @xmath1 lwsm phenomenologically viable and attractive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : n=3 ] we review the formalism of the @xmath1 lwsm .",

    "a lee - wick theory of degree @xmath5 for a given field @xmath15 is a particular higher - derivative theory in which the original lagrangian with a canonical kinetic energy term is augmented by the addition of terms containing up to @xmath16 additional covariant derivatives .",
    "such a lagrangian may be re - expressed in terms of an equivalent auxiliary field formalism in which @xmath15 is a linear combination of @xmath5 fields @xmath17 that alternate in the sign of their quantum - mechanical norm . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and summarized in this section , this construction can be implemented independently for fields @xmath15 that are real or complex scalars , fermions , or gauge fields . in particular , no obvious theory constraint fixes the mass parameters that appear with each additional pair of derivatives acting upon each field , so that one may consider scenarios , for example , in which only some of the sm particles have one lw partner , some have two , and some have none .    in the @xmath0 lw theory , the opposite - sign norms are incorporated by the fields corresponding to particles and their partners that appear in the lagrangian with a relative sign , _",
