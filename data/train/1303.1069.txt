    "such clusters are formed by particles that move roughly in the same direction .",
    "simulations of simple models of spps have revealed that similar clustering dynamics are observed for spps with both , polar  @xcite and nematic  @xcite alignment interactions .",
    "more detailed models display similar clustering statistics , e.g. , in simulations of self - propelled rods  @xcite , self - propelled disks  @xcite , particles with hydrodynamic coupling  @xcite , and swimming particles with flagella , e.g. , in sperm cells  @xcite .    in many of these systems ,",
    "a peculiar phase , characterized by the existence of remarkably large moving clusters , has been observed .",
    "one refers to this phase of collective motion as non - equilibrium clustering .",
    "this phase appears often as an intermediate phase between a completely disordered phase , with homogeneous density , and a phase with global orientational order .",
    "an experimental case ( myxobacteria ) and a simulation example ( self - propelled rods ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] .",
    "the occurrence of large clusters is strongly correlated with a crossover in the shape of the cluster size distributions ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : illustration ] . at the onset of the collective clustering phase",
    ", the csd follows a power law with a characteristic exponent .",
    "it has been observed in spp experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite that the csd can be power - law distributed with the exponent typically varying between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . while the range of exponents indicates the absence of a universal scaling at the onset of the collective clustering phase , it is not yet clear what determines the actual value of the exponent .",
    "the examples displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] and [ fig : struct ] indicate that the collective clustering phase often occurs in the absence of global order .",
    "other models , e.g. the classical vicsek model display a similar phase , but in the presence of global order  @xcite .",
    "a word of caution is in place here .",
    "most investigations that focused on the cluster statistics ( both , in experiments and simulations ) were carried out with small to intermediate numbers ( around @xmath6 ) of self - propelled particles , while investigations regarding the onset of global order were conducted with rather large numbers ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "hence , it is not completely clear if and how the system size , respectively the particle number , affects the onset of this collective clustering phase .    here",
    ", we focus on the emergence of the collective clustering phase in the absence of global order , i.e. we assume that cluster velocities are uncorrelated . we propose a kinetic clustering theory , based on the approach presented by us in  @xcite , and extend our earlier treatment to coagulation and fragmentation kernels that depend , respectively , on the scaling of the cluster cross - section with cluster `` mass '' , i.e. number of particles in the cluster , and the scaling of cluster perimeter with cluster mass .",
    "the scaling of the cluster cross - section and cluster perimeter are characterized by exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we present a comprehensive analysis of this kinetic cluster model , including a finite size ( fs ) study of it .",
    "the fs study of the kinetic model reveals that : i ) the transition to the collective clustering phase  characterized by a non monotonic csd  is generic to all spps with either a polar or nematic alignment mechanism , and ii ) that there exist a critical asymptotic csd exponent @xmath2 which is function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 only . by studying the physically meaningful parameter space @xmath0-@xmath1",
    "we find that @xmath2 always falls in the range @xmath3 .",
    "notice that in the absence of cluster - cluster correlations , this transition marks the onset of collective motion as observed in  @xcite . though the simplified clustering theory is strictly speaking only valid in the absence of global order , we show through simulations that a comparable picture holds for systems where global order is observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : clusteringtheory ] we present our simple kinetic clustering model under the assumption that there are no cluster - cluster correlations and show that for any finite system there are two clustering phases .",
    "we perform a system size analysis of the kinetic model in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : concludingremarks ] .",
    "we look for a description of the clustering process in terms of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the average value at time @xmath10 of clusters formed by @xmath11 particles , and @xmath12 the number of particles in the system . to ease the notation",
    ", we refer to @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "our strategy consists on deriving a coagulation smoluchowski equation with fragmentation for these @xmath14 objects . for an introduction to this kind of coagulation equations",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite . in spp systems ,",
    "the only conserved quantity is the number of particles @xmath12 .",
    "neither the overall orientational order nor the number of clusters are conserved .",
    "thus , our generalized coagulation smoluchowski equation should conserve the number of particles .",
    "we start by simplifying the clustering dynamics .",
    "since we are dealing with self - propelled particles , we assume that clusters are the result of either an explicit or an effective alignment mechanism such that particles inside a cluster move coherently in the same direction .",
    "this implies that clusters move at speeds comparable to that of the individual particles , independently of the size of the cluster .",
    "below we also discuss what can be expected if this condition is relaxed . on the contrary ,",
    "clusters of passive particles , driven by thermal fluctuations , are such that their mobility decreases as function of their size .",
    "we stress that the assumption of a size - independent cluster speed evidences the non - equilibrium nature of our simple cluster theory .",
    "we further assume that ( binary ) collisions among clusters may result in cluster - cluster fusion , and neglect the possibility of cluster fragmentation induced by cluster - cluster collision .",
    "this assumption is justified as long as the dynamics is overdamped , and is in accordance to what is observed in experiments with gliding bacteria  @xcite , and simulations with self - propelled rods  @xcite .",
    "we simplify the cluster fragmentation dynamics by assuming an evaporation - like process by which clusters shrink in size by loosing one by one those particles that are on the cluster boundary .",
    "more complex fragmentation process can be ignored as exponentially unlikely events . in summary , we are assuming an irreversible clustering process in which a cluster of mass @xmath15 can undergo the following `` reactions '' : @xmath16 notice that since the reaction @xmath17 does not occur , the process is , in this sense , irreversible .",
