    "ecent advances in the understanding of complex dynamic systems reveal intimate connections between information theory and optimal control , @xcite . to act optimally",
    ", engineering and biological systems must satisfy not only the requirements of optimal control , ( e.g. , getting close to a target state , tracking smoothly a nominal trajectory etc . ) , but increasingly other important constraints , such as the limitation of bandwidth , the restriction of memory or limited delays .",
    "a stochastic dynamic control system is driven from state to state by appropriate control signals from the admissible set of control signals .",
    "all the system states achievable by some admissible control signal define the reachable set of a dynamic system . in this work",
    "we take an alternative view of reachability , by studying the relation between the admissible control and the reachable set of states in terms of information theory . for this",
    ", we consider stochastic dynamic systems as information channel , @xcite , between these two sets , or more precisely , between two random variables - the stochastic control , and the resulting state of dynamic system , @xcite .",
    "each of the reachable set states is achievable by some control signal from the admissible control state . as elaborated below",
    ", an important property of the correspondence between the reachable and the admissible sets is a number of different control signals which are distinguishable at a particular reachable set state .",
    "a larger value would indicate a more influential control set .",
    "this influence is cast in the language of information theory as a question of the capacity between the control signal and the future state of the dynamic system .",
    "this control capacity , also known as empowerment,@xcite , has been shown to worked well as a universal heuristic in many contexts by generalizing `` controllability '' in an information - theoretic sense .",
    "it provides a plausible framework for generating intrinsic ( self - motivated ) behaviour in agents , eliminating the need for task - predefined , external rewards .    as an intuitive example , consider the underpowered pendulum , @xcite , driven by a * low - energy * stochastic control process .",
    "it has a ) stable and b ) unstable equilibria positions , ( the bottom and the top position , respectively ) . in the bottom state ,",
    "fewer states can be controllably reached than in the upright pendulum state . in the top state , while , on its own , unstable , with the help of a control signal , a richer set of separate `` futures '' ( in a still precisely to define sense ) can be controllably produced than in the bottom .",
    "the maximum number of distinguishable controls at the system output is given by the information capacity between the control random variable and the future state , viewed as a random variable depending on the ( random ) control signal . here",
    "the dynamic system comprises the information channel .    among other uses",
    ", it constitutes an example for agent controllers implementing so - called `` intrinsic motivation '' principle @xcite , a class of control algorithm which has recently received significant attention ; controllers based on these principles substitute problem - specific utilities by generic measures only depending on system dynamics to produce `` situation - relevant '' controls .",
    "the suitability of the control - state capacity ( empowerment ) to implement an `` intrinsic motivation''-style controller was explored in a series of theoretical and practical studies @xcite .",
    "the empowerment landscape is computed for a dynamical system and an agent is driven along this landscape as to maximize the local empowerment gradient .",
    "typical effects include ( but are not limited to ) the agent being led to unstable equilibria and being stabilized there .",
    "the control - state capacity produces pseudo - utility landscapes from the dynamics of the system and is a is a promising approach in designing a priori ( pre - task ) controls for artificial agents .    until now , little work has been done in the domain of continuous space and none in fully continuous ( rather than discretized ) time . here , actions need to be constrained by power , and , up to the present paper , no relation between favoured time horizon and control signal power in the continuous time was known . here",
    "we contribute by 1 ) calculating empowerment for continuous time and space ( continuous time was not considered in the past ) , 2 ) computing the full solution for the linear control case , 3 ) link time horizon characteristics and power .    to evaluate the empowerment of a partially observable dynamic system means to compute the channel capacity between the control and the final state , i.e. the maximum of the mutual information",
    "we propose to compute the maximum of the mutual information between the control process trajectory , which we denote by @xmath0 or briefly by @xmath1 , and the resulting system output , @xmath2 , where the system dynamics is perturbed by the process noise @xmath3 , and the system output is perturbed by the sensor noise @xmath4 .",

    "empowerment , in its original definition , requires the specification of its time horizon .",
    "this is the essential free parameter of the empowerment formalism .",
    "one question which regularly arises is how to choose this horizon .",
    "our study , amongst other , shows that a characteristic time horizon may emerge through the dynamics only .",
    "communication - limited control is another important concept in modern engineering where the control - state capacity is useful is communication - limited control .",
    "the control - state capacity considers the channel between the controller to the future state , while most of the work dealing with communication - limited control , e.g. @xcite , is focused on the channel between the state sensor to the controller .    for the first channel ,",
    "the central question is : _ what is the minimal information from the state to the controller that is required in order to satisfy a control objective?_. for the second channel , the central question is its dual : _",
    "what is the maximal information that can be transferred from the controller to the state?\"_.    these questions are complementary questions within the action - perception cycle paradigm , addressing the sensing and the actuation aspects of the cycle , respectively , @xcite .",
    "obviously , a comprehensive study of the control under communication constraints needs to consider also the dual , controller - to - state channel .",
    "these are only a selection of a multitude of directions where the control - state capacity has direct implications and provides new understandings . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on studying the intrinsic properties of this channel , relating the information - theoretic properties with properties of optimal control .",
    "in particular , we derive the relation between the energy , the time - horizon , and the capacity of the control - state of the dynamic system .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section [ problem definition ]",
    "we define the problem of the information capacity between the control signal and the future output .",
    "the solution is based on the bi - orthogonal representation of gaussian process .",
    "we establish the optimality conditions , kkt - conditions , for the optimal variances of the gaussian process expansion , and we show that the optimal set of the variances can be found efficiently by an iterative water - filling algorithm .",
    "the second component of the solution is formed by the expansion functions of the gaussian process expansion .",
    "we derive an optimality condition for the expansion functions .",
    "this optimality condition is satisfied by the spectral decomposition of the controllability gramian of the linear control system . in the rest of the paper we elaborate on the details of the solution .",
    "particularly , in section [ gauprosec ] we review briefly the bi - orthogonal expansion of gaussian processes . in section [ sec : mutinfo ] we define the mutual information for continuous - time linear control systems . in section [ sec : optprob ] we define the optimization problem , which solves the problem defined in section [ problem definition ] . in section [ sec : opteq ] we elaborate on the optimality conditions of the optimization problem , where we derive the kkt - optimality conditions and set the conditions for the optimality of the gaussian process expansion functions . in section [ sec : asymana ] we provide the asymptotic analysis of the control - to - output capacity . in section [ sec : simul ] we provide computer simulations of the developed method and explain their results . and , finally , in section [ sec : summ ]",
    "we summarise the work .",
    "we explore the dependency of the control capacity on the time horizon , @xmath8 , and the power , @xmath9 .",
    "we show how to compute efficiently the information capacity , @xmath10 , between the control signal and the future output in continuous - time linear control systems .",
    "the solution is based on the bi - orthogonal expansion of the gaussian process .",
    "this enables us to decompose the solution procedure into two independent aspects : the iterative water - filling algorithm , and the spectral decomposition of the controllability gramian .",
    "in our example , we find particularly that the control input signal contributes to the empowerment value only during a temporally limited phase . beyond this limited time window ,",
    "the future output is not essentially influenced by the control signal .",
    "this finding is consistent with intuition , as memoryless linear control systems forget far past input events .",
    "we establish a quantitative relation between empowerment and the intrinsic features of dynamic systems , such as the time constant , @xmath11 .",
    "particularly , we show the control capacity achieves a finite limit for @xmath12 .",
