    "direct photons are defined as photons that do not originate from hadronic decays . in hadron - hadron collisions , direct photons at large transverse momentum ( @xmath5 )",
    "are predominantly produced by the fundamental quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) 2-to-2 hard - scattering subprocesses , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the former subprocess , which dominates in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 and a@xmath1a collisions , is called `` the inverse qcd compton effect ''  @xcite .",
    "this subprocess is one of the most important of the qcd 2-to-2 subprocesses for three reasons :    1 .",
    "the photon is the only outgoing particle in fundamental qcd 2-to-2 subprocesses that is a single particle , which can be measured to high precision ; 2 .",
    "the scattered quark has equal and opposite transverse momentum to the direct - photon so that the transverse momentum of the jet from the fragmented quark is also precisely known ( modulo @xmath8 or multisoft gluon effects  @xcite ) ; and 3 .",
    "it is directly sensitive to the gluon distribution function of the proton times the distribution function of quarks , which is precisely measured in deeply inelastic lepton - proton scattering .",
    "if both the direct photon with @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath9 and the away side jet at @xmath10 are detected then , to the extent that the @xmath7 subprocess can be neglected in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 collisions due to the predominance of gluons over anti - quarks , the jet opposite to the direct photon is a quark  @xcite .",
    "tagging jets with direct photons provides an excellent method of studying any medium effect on the energy or fragmentation of the outgoing quark .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for @xmath11 in lo pqcd  @xcite in scattering of hadron a from hadron b takes on the simple form for the reaction @xmath12 : @xmath13 where the parton kinematics are fully determined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the ratio is somewhat less according to the ratio of the atomic number to the atomic mass .    beyond leading order ,",
    "direct photons can be produced either by bremsstrahlung from any quark line in a 2-to-2 subprocess , e.g. @xmath36 , or in a parton shower from fragmentation that forms a jet . in both these cases",
    "the photon is accompanied by jet fragments so that observing photons isolated from jets enhances the contribution from the fundamental 2-to-2 subprocesses .",
    "naturally , all these effects must be taken into account in theoretical calculations of direct photon production in pqcd , and such calculations  @xcite are generally in excellent agreement with all previous measurements , including those from phenix  @xcite . however , decreasing the uncertainties of both measurement and theory and extending the range to larger @xmath5 is desirable .",
    "measurements with and without an isolation criterion allow more specific comparisons of theoretical models and a better understanding of photons coming from bremsstrahlung and parton fragmentation .",
    "measurement of direct photons in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 collisions provides an important baseline for measurements in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "once produced , a photon emerges from the reaction almost unaffected since it only interacts electromagnetically .",
    "initial state modifications of the distribution functions in nuclei can be accessed by measurements in @xmath37a or @xmath38a collisions .",
    "similarly , direct photons provide a reference free from final state effects on the outgoing quark , which at lo initially balances the @xmath5 of the direct photon .    in this paper , we report a major update of the direct photon cross section measurement in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 collisions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "the present data has more than an order of magnitude improved statistics than that reported in @xcite .",

    "the dynamic range of the electronics is saturated for the highest energy clusters ( @xmath48 gev ) measured in this analysis .",
    "the size of this effect is estimated using a convolution of the maximum energy limit of each tower ( 26 gev typical ) and the fraction of energy deposited in the central tower of a electromagnetic shower cluster .",
    "this effect was found negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty for the very high energy photons that are affected .",
    "the drift chambers ( dc ) and the innermost layer of the pad chambers ( pc1 ) provide charged track information and were used to veto charged hadron clusters in the emcal . hits in the beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) positioned at pseudorapidities @xmath49 were used to measure a collision vertex from the time difference between hits in both bbcs , and to monitor the luminosity .",

    "a high @xmath5 photon sample was collected with an emcal trigger in which the analog sum of signals from a @xmath50 adjacent set of emcal towers was greater than a nominal energy threshold of 2 gev , which was in coincidence with the minimum - bias trigger , corresponding to @xmath51 pb@xmath52 integrated luminosity .",
    "the integrated luminosity was determined from the rate of a minimum - bias trigger that required hits in the bbcs and a collision vertex within 30 cm of the nominal center of the interation region . at @xmath2 gev",
    "this trigger selects 23.0 mb of the inelastic @xmath53 cross section .",

    "most of the conversion @xmath65 pairs in the @xmath66% of radiation length of material between the dc and the emcal are reconstructed as single photons because of the minimal magnetic field in this region .",
    "of course , no charged track would point to the cluster since the conversion would have happened after the dc .",
    "an additional 1% loss was attributed to these photon conversions from a geant @xcite simulation with a reasonable input @xmath5 distribution .",

    "<S> inclusive - direct photons were measured in the transverse momentum range from 5.525 gev/@xmath3 , extending the range beyond previous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> event structure was studied with an isolation criterion . </S>",
    "<S> next - to - leading - order perturbative - quantum - chromodynamics calculations give a good description of the spectrum . when the cross section is expressed versus @xmath4 , </S>",
