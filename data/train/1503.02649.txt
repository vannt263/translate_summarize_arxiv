    "these four protostars make up the `` hl  tau  region '' in l1551 . in this paper",
    "we adopt the standard mean distance to taurus of 140  pc @xcite for the hl  tau  region  pc , so that reported linear distances could be in error by up to @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ] .    as a result of the high extinction ,",

    "fortunately , at @xmath24 resolution most of the outflow emission is resolved out , making it possible to spatially resolve the morphology of the hl  tau  molecular gas disk for the first time . the @xmath24 resolution hco@xmath4  ( 1 - 0 ) channel maps shown in figure  [ channel ] reveal : ( 1 ) a notable deficit of blue vs. red - shifted emission ; ( 2 ) hco@xmath4  ( 1 - 0 ) absorption near the systemic velocity 6.5 - 7.0 km  s@xmath5 ; ( 3 ) a roughly keplerian velocity distribution with a detectable radial velocity range of 2.0 to 12.0 km  s@xmath5 ; ( 4 ) comparable gas and continuum disk sizes ( at least at the current sensitivity level ) . to further explore points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , figure  [ abpv ] shows spectra from the @xmath23 resolution cubes toward the continuum peak",

    "self - absorption by this outflowing gas is likely responsible for both the non - gaussian line shape and the deficit of observable blue - shifted disk emission .",
    "the deepest absorption for the cn and hcn transitions occurs at a lsrk velocity of @xmath149 km  s@xmath5 which we take to be the rest velocity of the system .    under the assumption of circular keplerian motion , and noting that the velocity extrema of hco@xmath4  ( 1 - 0 ) emission occurs at @xmath150  km  s@xmath5 ( see fig .",

    "this value is near the high end of the range previously reported for hl  tau ( see  1 ) .",
    "however , it is clear that even on the less absorbed red - shifted side , the velocity pattern is not so simple , and may for example have a contribution from infall ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "future detailed radiative transfer analysis coupled with a physical model will be required to reproduce the complex hco@xmath4  ( 1 - 0 ) absorption and emission toward the hl  tau disk in order to obtain a more accurate kinematic stellar mass .      at 2.9  mm",

    "what is the nature of the remarkable pattern of bright and dark rings in the continuum emission from the hl  tau  protoplanetary disk ? here we highlight four key observational findings .",
    "first , the correlated radial structure of higher spectral index and lower brightness temperature in the dark rings , relative to the bright rings , demonstrates that the optical depth must be lower in the dark rings .",
    "second , the fact that the centers of nearly all of the rings are significantly offset from the dust continuum peak provides compelling evidence that the rings are not circular as assumed , but rather have some eccentricity with hl  tau at one focus .",
    "third , the magnitude of the offset increases with ring radius , which is tantalizingly congruent with the observed increase in orbital eccentricity for exoplanets at large orbital radii @xcite .",
    "fourth , several of these rings appear to be in resonances with each other . assuming keplerian orbits and neglecting the mass between the rings , the first four dark rings have orbital periods in the proportion d1:d2:d3:d4",
    "= 1:4:6:8 .",
    "there also appear to be resonances between bright and dark rings , with d2 in a 2:1 resonance with b1 and in a 1:4 resonance with b6 .",
    "these mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) are calculated to be within the confidence intervals obtained on the semi - major axes . given the precise constraints obtained on the orbital radius of the bright and dark rings , the n : m resonances found here have uncertainties between 0.01 and 0.09 , making these resonance ratios unlikely to arise from random chance .",
    "although multi - planetary systems show a diverse architecture  au of the host star . ] and many pairs of exoplanets are far from being in mmr @xcite , a growing number of stable systems do exist in or near mmr @xcite .",
    "gravitational interactions between planets and their parent disk can lead to resonant and near - resonant systems ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "collectively , these four independent lines of evidence suggest that the observed dark rings are low column density gaps in the disk material arising from the process of planet formation .",
    "in this paper , we present multiwavelength alma images of the hl  tau  protoplanetary disk at resolutions as fine as a few au .",
    "we derive precise measurements of the disk inclination and position angle , as well as the proper motion of the central protostar .",
    "we also show the first molecular line observations to spatially resolve the disk kinematics . under the assumption of keplerian rotation ,",
    "the mass of the central star is @xmath169",
    "m@xmath165 , but further refinement will require detailed radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the remarkable pattern of bright and dark circumstellar rings in the continuum images exhibits a corresponding structure in the spectral index image , revealing that the dust in the central core and several of the bright rings are optically thick , while the dust in the dark rings  which are not completely empty  shows evidence of grain growth .",
    "several characteristics of these rings , including an increase in eccentricity with radius and numerous resonances , suggest that the dark rings are gaps arising from the process of planet formation .",
    "modeling of the disk temperature and density structure in both gas and dust , coupled with planet formation processes will be crucial to the goal of reproducing hl  tau s morphology from theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these transformational alma observations of hl  tau herald a new era in the study of protoplanetary disks that promises to unearth the architecture of extrasolar multi - planetary systems during their epoch of formation , and thereby illuminate the origin of our own solar system .",

    "the data were calibrated in casa  4.2.2 using the same procedure adopted for standard science operations , with two exceptions .",
    "an imprecise position was inadvertently used for the phase calibrator j0431 + 2037 employed for the 2.9 and 1.3  mm data .",
    "the shift was small ( @xmath170  mas ) , but noticeable when compared to the 0.87  mm data , for which a precise position for j0431 + 1731 was employed .",

    "both final phase calibrator positions were taken from http://astrogeo.org/vlbi/solutions/rfc_2012b/rfc_2012b_cat.txt .",
    "the small shifts in position due to proper motion over the month long observing span have been ignored .",
    "additionally , the final lbc antenna position corrections were applied before the data were calibrated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each execution ,",
    "the bandpass and absolute flux calibrators were dynamically chosen by the alma online system and alternated between the frequently monitored quasars j0423 - 0120 and j0510 + 1800 , depending on the lst start time@xmath177 . based on comparison of the resulting calibrated phase calibrator flux densities across the many executions for each band",
    ", we estimate that the absolute flux calibration is good to within @xmath178 for the final combined data at each wavelength .",
    "the continuum images for all three bands were made using multi - frequency synthesis , and the visibility weighting employed was mid - way between natural and uniform ( i.e. , casa _ clean _ parameter _ robust=0.0 _ ) .",
    "individually , the 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm data have a fractional bandwidth small enough ( @xmath179 ) to ignore spectral index effects in the imaging .",
    "in contrast , the range of continuum spws available for the 2.9  mm image ( 90.8 to 102.9 ghz ) , if all combined , would require accounting for at least a linear spectral index slope across the band , given the expected range of dust spectral indices @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "however , inclusion of the spectral slope requires good signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) at both frequency extrema of the calculation @xcite , a condition the 2.9  mm data did not fulfill since four of the five available continuum spws were clustered at @xmath182 ghz .",
    "thus , the 2.9  mm continuum image was created excluding the 90.8  ghz spw and without accounting for the spectral index . to make an image with the highest possible combination of fidelity and angular resolution we also made a combined band  6 + 7 ( 1.0  mm ) image ( fractional bandwidth @xmath183 ) accounting for spatial variations in the spectral index ( casa _ clean _ parameter",
    "_ nterms=2 _ ) .",
    "in this case , the s / n is high at both extrema and the resulting image and spectral index map are reliable ( the derived @xmath2 have a statistical s / n of up to several hundred ) .",
    "additionally , we used the _ multiscale _ imaging option @xcite for all three bands with scales of 0 , 5 , and 15 , approximately corresponding to 0 , 1 , and 3@xmath184 the synthesized beam . using these imaging parameters , the combined continuum data at each band was iteratively self - calibrated .",
    "the continuum peak position in all bands changed by @xmath185  mas following self - calibration .",
    "the final synthesized beams and rms noise levels are given in table  [ cont ] .",
    "even with alma s impressive collecting area , the surface brightness sensitivity at very high angular resolution is limited for detecting narrow thermal lines . to improve the surface brightness sensitivity ,",
    "the data for the four band  3 line transitions were tapered to a resolution of @xmath186 ( and later convolved to exactly this value ) and imaged with _ robust=0.5 _ , and a velocity width of 0.25  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath18co  ( 1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath4  ( 1 - 0 ) lines both show significant extended emission at this resolution and were cleaned with the same multiscale parameters as the continuum ( an additional scale of 45 was used for co ) .",
    "the cn  ( 1 - 0 ) and hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) lines are only detected in absorption toward the continuum peak .",
