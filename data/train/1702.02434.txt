    "observing at low radio frequencies ( @xmath2  ghz ) is of a particular value ; low energy and old plasma can be revealed , tracing and constraining physical conditions in galaxies . in star forming galaxies the low surface brightness plasma forms e.g. extended halos associated with winds and large scale magnetic fields , or diffuse emission from galactic disks .",
    "furthermore , measurements at low radio frequencies can help to distinguish for instance between thermal and non - thermal plasma , and their absorbing mechanisms , responsible for the level of observed radio emission .",
    "it is expected that the square kilometre array ( ska ) will unravel a large star - forming galaxy population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but before we can embark on a large scale study of star - forming and starburst galaxies and their evolution with continuum radio surveys , we need to understand the origin of the complex radio spectral energy distributions and morphologies of these galaxies .",
    "nearby objects are ideal laboratories for this task .",
    "ngc  253 is the dominant galaxy in the nearby sculptor group , at a distance of 3.94  mpc from the local group @xcite and velocity @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 .",

    "as one of the closest and most prominent galaxies , ngc  253 has been extensively studied in all wavelengths , including broadband radio continuum , polarization and hi observations .",
    "radio emission from starburst galaxies originates from two principal components : the non - thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons spiralling in the interstellar magnetic field , and the thermal emission from electrons colliding with ions in the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) around hot stars .",
    "the sources of the non - thermal emission are predominantly cosmic rays accelerated by supernova remnants ( snr ) that in ngc  253 ultimately create a prominent synchrotron radio halo @xcite .",
    "studies of the ngc  253 magnetic field suggest the disk wind model and large - scale dynamo action to be shaping the vertical structure of the field , which in turn enhances the cosmic ray transport through a collimation of strong , starburst driven superwind .",
    "the starburst region of ngc  253 is violently active ; the supernova rate of the inner 300  pc of the galaxy is estimated to be between @xmath9 and @xmath10  yr@xmath4 , and the star formation rate is @xmath11  m@xmath7  yr@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "the broadband spectrum of the total radio emission from ngc  253 is steep , although flattening at mhz radio frequencies ( figure  [ rys : radio - spectra ] ) .",
    "the total radio emission originates from snrs , hii regions ( predominantly central starburst region ; e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , but cf .",
    "@xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) and electrons ( cosmic rays ) freely spiralling in the large scale magnetic field . the steep spectrum is understood to be of a synchrotron origin .",
    "the flattening of the spectrum , however , may be due to a number of reasons , including some degree of absorption of the synchrotron emission ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ssa ] ) and a low energy cut - off of the electron population , where in general it is assumed the electron energy ( @xmath37 ) spectrum can be described as a power - law @xmath38 with the index @xmath39 related to the radio spectral index as @xmath40 .",
    "the low radio frequency flattening of the spectra of starburst galaxies is not unusual and it has been observed previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we attempt to separate the contribution of the extended and central starburst emission to the total flux densities to see if the spectral flattening can be attributed mostly to the absorption occurring in the central starburst region . to do this we simultaneously fitted the total flux density and the central starburst region spectra , assuming an underlying 2- or 3-component spectrum composed of the central starburst region ( component c ) and extended emission ( component e , composed of one or two components ) .",
    "as an example of our fitting method , in the case where the component e is modeled as a power - law and component c as a free - free absorbed synchrotron emission , the model equation ( @xmath41 takes the following form    @xmath42    where @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 is given by eqn .",

    "this model equation is then compared to our observed data ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 . in the 2-component model",
    ", we fit the component e with either simple power - law or a curved spectrum ( 2nd degree polynomial ; eqn .",
    "[ eqn : poly ] ) . in the 3-component model",
    ", we fit the component e with a combination of power - law and either a curved spectrum , synchrotron self - absorbed ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ssa ] ) or synchrotron free - free absorbed component ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfa ] ) .",
    "the component c is modeled with either 2nd - degree polynomial , self - absorbed synchrotron or synchrotron power - law emission with a free - free absorbing screen .",
    "we find the best fitting model to be the 3-component model , with ( 1 ) the component e modeled as a combination of a simple power - law and 2nd order polynomial , with a total flux density @xmath53  jy and @xmath54 at reference frequency 1  ghz , and 34% of @xmath55 becoming absorbed at low frequencies as described by 2nd order polynomial with @xmath56 , and ( 2 ) the component c modeled as a synchrotron plasma with an internal free - free absorbing screen , with @xmath57  jy , @xmath58  mhz , @xmath59 .",
    "the 3-component model ( @xmath60 , dof  @xmath61 ) is favoured over any 2-component model , even if the component e is modeled as a 2nd order polynomial ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "preference of the 3-component model indicates that flattening of the component e spectrum at the lower frequencies is non - negligible . in principle",
    ", this flattening could be attributed to synchrotron self - absorption caused by shock re - acceleration of the halo / disk plasma , an external free - free absorbing screen , or an intrinsic low - energy cut - off of the electron distribution .",
    "thermal free - free absorption can be largely excluded based on the limited evidence for high thermal content in the ngc  253 halo , especially in the sw region ( see  [ sec : spectral - maps ] for details ) . although our bayesian inference tests indicate that the flattening caused by the synchrotron self - absorption is moderately favoured over the low - energy cut - off in the electron distribution which could be inferred from the 2nd order polynomial fit ( @xmath63 ) , we find that the former fit is associated with very high uncertainties .",
    "we also find that any model invoking multiple internal components that we tested is strongly favoured over an external free - free absorbing screen .",
    "our results do not change in the absence of the data points between 300 and 600  mhz that may seem unusually high , which further strengthens our result that the radio emitting plasma in the disk and halo of ngc  253 is composed of at least two spectral components that behave differently .",
    "this result is also in line with our findings on the radio spectral index variation across the galaxy ( discussed further in the next section ) .",
    "furthermore , another important result of our spectral modeling is that the central starburst region is best modeled by the sfa model .",
    "although , in principle , the 2nd order polynomial is statistically favoured , the sfa model is more realistic .",
    "curved radio spectra can be explained by low energy cut - off of electron population , ssa , sfa or ffa models . as we have shown the ssa model",
    "is statistically ruled out (  [ sec : nucleus ] ) . given the overwhelming evidence of significant thermal component in the central starburst ( e.g. figure  [ rys : multi - images ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coexisting with synchrotron plasma , the synchrotron free - free absorption model is more likely than the low energy cut - off in electron population .",
    "the plasma becomes optically thick around frequency @xmath64  mhz .",
    "given this result , and under a simplified assumption that a uniform optical depth holds across the region , we estimate a typical emission measure @xcite of the absorbing gas towards the central starburst region to be very high , of the order @xmath65  pc  @xmath66 .",
    "we now consider the origin of the @xmath33 variation across the ngc  253 disk and halo .",
    "the southern flattening occurs beyond the sw spiral arm , in the halo region . in figure  [ rys : lucero ] we overplot the @xmath67 and extraplanar hi contours on the _ xmm - newton _ soft x - ray image of ngc  253 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission indicates ionized hot gas .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the neutral cold hi gas seems to surround the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "the radio spectral index spatial variations seem to follow the distribution of the x - ray emission , with the @xmath33 steepening occurring in the regions of intense soft x - ray emission ( radio spur and nw halo ) and the flattening around the voids of diffuse x - ray plasma ( western se halo , eastern nw halo ) .",
    "this distribution seems to also match the extraplanar hi emission , especially in the western se halo region . in h@xmath33",
    "we detect faint diffuse emission in the ne halo and the southern ` spur ' ( figure  [ rys : multi - images ] ) , with the line fluxes measured down to @xmath68  erg  s@xmath69 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath69 . in these regions",
    "the spectral index seems to steepen ( figure  [ rys : lucero]b ) .",
    "there is , however , almost no h@xmath33 emission present in the western se halo , while most of the flattening of the component e in the modeling of  [ sec : nonthermal - emission ] is due to this region ( figure  [ rys : lucero]c , regions 8 and 9 in figure  [ rys : sp - idx ] ) .    it has previously been suggested that the halo gas originates from both galactic ` fountains ' from the star - forming disk and a galactic superwind .",
    "this strong superwind may be pushing and collimating the neutral cold gas in the halo @xcite . in the case of strong collimation shocks",
    "one may observe flattening of radio spectra due to synchrotron self - absorption in transverse shocks .",
    "our results seem to favour such a scenario .",
    "it is also worth noting that the spectrum flattening of the sw halo corresponds to an extended loop , or arch , seen in optical images .",
    "however , if the sw halo is predominantly diffuse , and of low density , the flattening may be rather due to an intrinsic low - energy cut off of the electron distribution .",
    "another important note is that , based on our broadband radio spectrum modeling , the sw halo region can not be fully responsible for the total spectrum flattening .",
    "radio emission that becomes absorbed at lower frequencies constitutes more than 30% of the total extended radio emission at 1  ghz ( @xmath70  jy ) , while the sw region is only 0.77  jy at that frequency , which means that the flattening must be also occurring , although in a smaller degree , in other regions across the disk and halo .",
    "although the sw flattening of the radio spectral index is most likely of a synchrotron origin , an external free - free absorbing screen was also previously suggested .",
    "the foreground absorption model was favoured by @xcite based on their x - ray data modeling and apparent differences of radio and x - ray halo morphologies .",
    "as proved later , deep continuum and polarization radio observations at both ghz and mhz frequencies reveal the horn - like structure of the radio halo , which directly resembles the x - ray diffuse emission .",
    "based on the equipartition assumptions , find the magnetic field within the halo to be very high , @xmath71 g , reaching as much as @xmath72 g in the central regions and @xmath73 g in the starburst outflow .",
    "the magnetic field in the central regions is strong enough for synchrotron emission to contribute a few per  cent to the total x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we also find that an external free - free absorbing screen is not a statistically preferred model .",
    "these new findings support models in which the total x - ray emission may indeed come from a combination of thermal and synchrotron plasma rather than multi - temperature pure thermal plasma with an externally caused absorption ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "we present deep , low - frequency radio continuum images and flux density measurements of a nearby , archetypal starburst galaxy , ngc  253",
    ". our data are part of the galactic and extragalactic all - sky mwa survey and the mwa eor observations .",
    "the images span frequencies between 76 and 231  mhz at angular resolution of 1.7  5 arcmin and rms noise levels of 4  75 mjy ( depending on frequency ) , and present the deepest measurements of ngc  253 at these low radio frequencies yet .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we detect a large - scale synchrotron radio halo that at 154231  mhz displays the x - shaped / horn - like structure seen at ghz radio frequencies , and is broadly consistent with other multiwavelength observations of ngc  253 . 2 .",
    "the projected maximum vertical extent of the synchrotron emission at 169  mhz extends up to 7.5  kpc nw ( 7.9  kpc se ) from the major axis of ngc  253 , consistent with large - scale soft x - ray emission ( extending 9  kpc nw ) and x - ray outflow ( 6.3  kpc se ) .",
    "the radio spectrum of the central starburst region of ngc  253 is significantly curved at low radio frequencies , with the spectral turnover occurring around 230240  mhz , which is for the first time statistically constrained .",
    "the radio spectral index maps show significant spectral variations in the structure of ngc  253 between 200  mhz and 1.465  ghz .",
    "in particular , we isolate a region of statistically significant spectral flattening to the western side of the se halo . however , as the sw region is rather faint at 1.46  ghz it can not be fully responsible for the total spectrum flattening , which indicates that the flattening must be also occurring , likely in a smaller degree , in other regions across the disk and halo",
    "the broadband spectrum of integrated total radio emission of ngc  253 is best described as a sum of central starburst and extended emission , where the central starburst component is best modeled as an internally free - free absorbed synchrotron plasma , and the extended emission as synchrotron emission flattening at low radio frequencies .",
    "we also find that an external free - free absorbing screen is not a statistically preferred model when compared to models including multiple internal components .",
    "we find that the extended emission of ngc  253 is best modeled by a combination of two synchrotron components , one of which becomes significantly absorbed at low radio frequencies .",
    "the flattening occurs at frequencies below @xmath74  mhz , and may be attributed to synchrotron self - absorption of shock re - accelerated electrons or an intrinsic low - energy cut off of the electron distribution .",
