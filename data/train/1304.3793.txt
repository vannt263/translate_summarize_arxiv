    "the large volume detector ( lvd ) , in the infn gran sasso national laboratory ( italy ) , below an average 3600 m water equivalent rock overburden , is a 1 kt liquid scintillator detector whose major purpose is monitoring the galaxy to study neutrino bursts from gravitational stellar collapses @xcite .",
    "lvd consists of an array of 840 scintillator counters , 1.5 m@xmath0 each , divided in three , identical and independent _",
    "towers_. each counter is viewed from the top by three 15 cm photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) @xcite .",
    "+ the lvd liquid scintillator is a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 with @xmath3 = 9.6 ) also known as _",
    "white spirit_. for historical reasons 73% of the lvd scintillator was produced in russia and has an aromatic hydrocarbons content of @xmath416@xmath5 , while the remaining amount has been produced in italy and contains @xmath48@xmath5 of aromatics .",
    "the scintillator with the higher percentage of aromatics presents a light yield of about 20@xmath5 higher .",
    "we do not expect this slight difference on the scintillator composition to have an impact on the quenching factors therefore we decided to measure the proton light output response in the liquid scintillator produced in russia that is present in the majority of counters ( lvd - scint ) .",
    "+ in addition , since in 2005 one of the lvd counters ( with aromatic hydrocarbons content of @xmath48@xmath5 ) was doped with gadolinium @xcite to improve the signal to noise ratio in neutron detection , we decided to repeat the measurement also on this particular scintillator ( lvd - gd ) .",
    "+ in organic scintillators the light output response , the energy emitted as fluorescence , is non - linear with respect to the energy deposited by ionizing particles ( this is particularly true for highly ionizing particles ) .",
    "this behavior is attributed to quenching of the primary excitation by the high ionization density along the particle track which leads to a decrease of the scintillation efficiency . in the absence of quenching",
    "the light yield is proportional to the energy released , which may be written in differential form as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fluorescent energy emitted per unit path length , @xmath8 is the scintillation efficiency and @xmath9 is the specific stopping power . to describe the quenching effect , birks",
    "@xcite proposed a semi - empirical relation in which the differential light output is reduced for high energy loss : @xmath10 where the product @xmath11 is usually treated as a single parameter and it is known as birks factor . + the quenching factor for ions is defined as the ratio of light yield of ions to that of electrons of the same energy . integrating eq .",
    "[ eqbirks ] it can be written as : @xmath12",
    "two scintillator detectors of the same dimensions of the counters of the lvd experiment , have been used to perform the measurements .",
    "each detector consists of a 1 @xmath13 1 @xmath13 1.5 m@xmath0 stainless steel tank filled with 1.2 ton of liquid scintillator and viewed from the top by three pmts photonis xp3550 of 5  diameter .",
    "the signals of each pmt are recorded by a caen v1724 waveform digitizer , with 100 mhz of sampling frequency and 137 @xmath14 of resolution per bit .",
    "the board hosts a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) for each input channel .",
    "the data stream is continuously written in a circular memory buffer , which is frozen by the fpga when the trigger occurs .",
    "the board implement also the zero length encoding ( zle ) algorithm for data reduction .",
    "this algorithm allows to set a threshold , which could be different from the trigger threshold , and discard the data under threshold saving time in both data transfer and processing .",
    "the acquisition window length , the number of samples pre- and post - trigger , the threshold and the level of coincidence among different channels are programmable features .",
    "+ in the center of the detector we have inserted an @xmath15am@xmath16be source encapsulated in a waterproof housing and held in place by a stainless steel rod .",
    "+ the radionuclide @xmath15am decays emitting an alpha particle of 5.6 mev . under bombardment by alphas",
    ", @xmath16be undergoes a nuclear reaction forming the excited compound nucleus @xmath17c@xmath18 , which then decays mostly producing either @xmath19c at ground state or at the first excited level @xcite : @xmath20 in the latter case the neutron is accompanied by a de - excitation gamma - ray of energy 4.44 mev .",
    "the source used in these measurements emits about 10 neutrons s@xmath21 .",
    "+ the emitted neutrons are thermalized by elastic scattering on the hydrogen atoms of the organic scintillator . during the slowing down process",
    ", a fraction of the neutron kinetic energy is converted to photons which are detected by the pmts giving the prompt signal . after being thermalized ,",
    "neutrons are eventually captured by @xmath22h , @xmath23gd ( when present ) and with lower probability by @xmath19c and @xmath24fe nuclei producing the delayed signal .",
    "the mean neutron capture time depends on the target composition ( n - capture cross section ) and on the detector geometry because neutrons which migrate farther from the source can escape from the detector leading to a shorter mean capture time .",
    "in the present work we will refer to the light output in terms of the scintillator response to electrons , as this can be taken to be linear ( within @xmath41@xmath5 for electrons of energy e @xmath25 2 mev ) .",
    "the measured signals will then be expressed in mev electron recoils equivalent ( mev@xmath26 ) .",
    "+ assuming that our scintillator has a response function to nuclear recoils consistent with that of similar organic scintillators , we should expect signals up to @xmath42 mev@xmath26 for neutrons of 6.5 mev which elastically scatter protons .",
    "neutrons of lower energy are accompanied with a 4.44 mev gamma emission , according to equations [ eqn1 ] and [ eqn2 ] .",
    "+ neutron captures on h are followed by the emission of the 2.22 mev @xmath27 quantum from the deuterium de - excitation ; while captures on gd originate @xmath27 cascades of total energy @xmath48 mev .",
    "as we want to measure the prompt signals with a threshold as low as possible , we decided to trigger on the delayed pulse and then look backward in time to find the prompt one . the trigger condition to enable samples storage",
    "was chosen to be a 3-fold coincidence of the pmts signal exceeding a threshold of 1.8 mev@xmath26 for the counter with lvd - scint and 3.2 mev@xmath26 for the counter with lvd - gd .",
    "the background rate at these thresholds , for a counter placed underground , is about 50@xmath5 and 2@xmath5 of the neutron rate from the source .",
    "+ neutron events are selected requiring that the delayed pulse must be accompanied , in a time window of 320 @xmath28s preceding the trigger , by a second signal ( prompt ) detected with a zle threshold of 0.8 mev@xmath26 for both the detectors .",
    "this additional condition helps to get rid of the background enanching the signal to noise ratio of about a factor ten .",
    "+ the highest - energy prompt signals are large enough to trigger by themselves , in this case the delayed pulse will be left out of the acquisition window .",
    "to avoid this situation the acquisition window has been increased to 640 @xmath28s moving the trigger in the middle of it . in this way we can consider the trigger pulse as due to nuclear recoil or nuclear capture , depending on the presence of a pulse in the following or in the preceding 320 @xmath28s respectively . in turn",
    "the pulse in the pre - trigger region can be regarded as a recoil signal and used to extend the recoil energy spectrum down to 0.8 mev@xmath26 .",
    "[ dt ] we show the distribution of the absolute value of the difference between the trigger pulse and the pre - trigger or post - trigger pulse if present in the same event , for both the scintillators measured . fitting the distribution with an exponential function we found , for lvd - scint , a mean neutron capture time of 210 @xmath28s , well in agreement with previous measurements taking into account that the neutron source was placed in the center of the detector .",

    "gray points represent the background level , obtained applying the same analysis to a dataset collected after removing the am - be source .",
    "+ we developed a monte carlo simulation based on the geant4 toolkit @xcite implementing the detector description and the am - be source energy spectrum taken from @xcite .",
    "+ geant4 has high precision transport models ( g4neutronhpelastic and g4neutronhpinelastic ) available for neutrons of energies up to 20 mev and for all materials .",
