    "color superconductivity / superfluidity @xcite is now a generally accepted conjecture about the state of matter at high baryon densities and low temperatures .",
    "many of its features have been quite comprehensively explored , and are summarized or referenced in a recent review  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon describes cooper pairing between quarks , with specific pairing patterns predicted as a function of  control \" parameters such as external fields , quark masses or momentum mismatch , the latter arising usually as a consequence of neutrality conditions  @xcite .",
    "for example , at very high density @xmath2 and for @xmath3 massless flavors without any magnetic fields , the preferred pairing pattern is a flavor and color - democratic one termed the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite .",
    "as we tune parameters such as quark masses or magnetic fields to values typically found in compact stars , the cfl state would yield to a less symmetric pairing pattern .",
    "it is important to study these different manifestations of color superconductivity , since any hope of observing such exotic phases is tied to the physical properties of compact stars such as neutron or possibly quark stars .",
    "however , the analysis gets complicated due to the interplay of many effects .",
    "such stars have enormous magnetic fields , of order @xmath4 g at the surface , but possibly up to @xmath5 g in the core , which affects the diquark pairing .",
    "also , one may want to consider the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , since core densities are only moderately high compared to that of the cfl phase .",
    "compact objects are , of course , charge neutral ( either locally or globally ) and color neutral ( locally if we consider homogeneous phases ) - this imposes additional constraints as we have mentioned .    0.2 cm    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of electric and color charge neutrality on the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase of cold and dense quark matter in presence of constant external magnetic fields and at moderate baryon densities .",
    "several works have addressed parts of this problem and arrived at important conclusions : we summarize some of them here to orient ourselves along the new directions in this work . in the earliest works , based on expansions of the thermodynamic potential in powers of @xmath6  @xcite , it was found that the neutral unmagnetized 2sc phase is energetically disfavored compared to the cfl phase at compact star densities .",
    "however , within the njl - model , it was determined that there are windows of the phase diagram where such a 2sc phase can arise , provided the diquark coupling strength ( expressed as a ratio to scalar coupling ) @xmath1 is chosen to be large and quark masses are computed dynamically  @xcite . at more natural values of @xmath1 ,",
    "gapless quasiparticles arise when the mismatch in down and up quark chemical potentials @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of magnetic fields into the quark superconductor has important consequences .",
    "taking the example of cfl phase , one of these is the emergence of a rotated photon that can penetrate superconducting quark matter , so that magnetic flux screening by the meissner effect is very weak  @xcite .",
    "another is the reduction in symmetry of the cfl phase since only @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks have the same electromagnetic charge  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field can enhance certain condensates , which changes the superconducting gap from the unmagnetized state  @xcite .",
    "strong oscillations in the gap parameter and the magnetization as a function of applied field can make the homogeneous magnetized phase unstable  @xcite .",
    "these works focused on the cfl phase , which is automatically color and charge neutral . however , neutron star densities span a more moderate range , where two - flavor pairing and neutrality effects play an important role .",
    "electric charge neutrality of the 2sc phase with chiral condensates was studied in  @xcite , but in the absence of magnetic fields or the possibility of gapless phases . in previous work , we studied the effect of a large magnetic field on the chiral and diquark condensates in a regime of moderately dense quark matter  @xcite .",
    "our focus was on the inter - dependence of the two condensates through non - perturbative quark mass and strong coupling effects , as done for the unmagnetized case in  @xcite but neutrality effects were ignored . in such a case , a mixed broken phase with co - existing chiral and diquark condensate arises  @xcite .",
    "we also found that at large @xmath1 , a large magnetic field changes the nature of the phase transitions in this mixed broken phase region .    0.2 cm    an extension of our work  @xcite to include color neutrality was performed in  @xcite and the authors found a change in the order of the phase transition from normal to superconducting quark matter .",
    "however , it was assumed that no intermediate phases of lower symmetry exist between the cfl and normal phase , which is a drastic assumption .",
    "furthermore , since the njl model has no dynamical color fields , the color chemical potential @xmath10 has to be introduced by hand , and is a very small correction to the free energy .",
    "consequently , its effects on competition between phases is also likely to be small , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "however , charge neutrality can be a more important factor for the same . in this paper",
    ", we therefore turn our attention to a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of neutrality ( both color and charge ) for magnetized two - flavor quark matter .",
    "this is perhaps the phenomenological regime most relevant to neutron stars .",
    "we present results for the quark gap , constituent mass and neutralizing charges as a function of density for weak and strong magnetic fields . while we defer the comparison of different phases to future work , this work has important new emergent conclusions , such as the clogston - chandrasekhar limit  @xcite for the g2sc phase , the disappearance of the mixed broken phase and the possibility of strongly magnetized domains of neutral but superconducting quark matter in the star .",
    "0.2 cm    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ lagran ] , we state the model njl lagrangian and its parameters . in section  [ part",
    "] , we recast the partition function in terms of interpolating bosonic variables and derive the thermodynamic potential . in section",

    ", an alternate phase , such as the loff phase would be preferred .",
    "this is the familiar clogston - chandrasekhar limit predicted for electronic superconductors .",
    "an important difference is that in condensed matter systems , there is no analog of the charge neutrality condition , so @xmath173 would go to zero . in case of",

    ", we observe that even if @xmath193 , quark matter is not necessarily in the 2sc phase . in fig .",
    "[ g2sc2sc](a ) we see that most of the time @xmath48 is larger than @xmath84 which is the 2sc phase but in the range of @xmath194 gev@xmath163 , @xmath48 becomes zero .",
    "this happens again at the clogston - chandrasekhar limit , but at a magnetic field value that is about 4 times larger than for the g2sc phase .",
    "this is because the mismatch @xmath84 in the charged csc phase does not get as severely stressed by the magnetic field .",
    "we also note that due to the vanishing gap , this phase can no longer be classified as the 2sc phase . in fig .",
    "[ g2sc2sc](b ) we see that for very large values @xmath188 , @xmath48 is always above @xmath84 in the entire range of @xmath177 .",
    "thus , this phase is the usual 2sc phase .",
    "we have studied the effect of a large magnetic field and neutrality constraints on the chiral and diquark condensate in a two - flavor superconductor using the njl model .",
    "we used a self - consistent scheme to determine the condensates , numerically iterating the coupled ( integral ) equations for the chiral and superconducting gap under the constraints of color and charge neutrality .",
    "we presented results for the 2sc as well as the gapless 2sc phase by choosing various values of the @xmath1 ratio . for magnetic fields @xmath195 g ,",
    "our results for the chiral and superconducting gaps align with the zero magnetic field results of  @xcite , since many landau levels ( @xmath196 ) are being summed over , which approximates the continuum result .",
    "we note that the chiral and superconducting phase transitions occur at the same value of @xmath197 .",
    "this changes at very large values of @xmath198 g for the gapless 2sc phase , where the color superconducting phase transition becomes a crossover .",
    "furthermore , the value of the superconducting gap in the gapless 2sc phase is much smaller than that in the charge neutral 2sc phase .",
    "both effects have to do with stresses on the up and down quark fermi surfaces due to the charge neutrality constraint .",
    "0.2 cm    as found in previous works on the three - flavor gap or cfl phase  @xcite , the two - flavor gap at large magnetic field @xmath198 g exhibits shubnikov de haas - van alphen oscillations due to discrete fluctuations of the quark density of states as a function of magnetic field .",
    "these oscillations can become quite large for strong magnetic fields , and even for @xmath1 ratios that normally correspond to strong coupling , i.e , yield the 2sc phase at zero field , the gap can vanish when @xmath199 . physically , this means that the homogeneous gap ansatz is not the correct one anymore , and probably a loff phase  @xcite is the preferred one .",
    "large oscillations in the gap can also lead to the formation of magnetic domains if the homogeneous phase becomes unstable / metastable , with applications to magnetar phenomena as argued in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of charge neutrality , through the momentum mismatch of the down and up quarks , is the clogston - chandrasekhar limit  @xcite , originally formulated as a critical magnetic field in hard electronic superconductors . while difficult to confirm experimentally in metals , due to the strong meissner effect , it can be achieved more easily in a color superconductor , where the rotated photon @xmath200 can penetrate . in the gapless 2sc phase",
    ", we find that this limit is reached at @xmath201 g .",
    "it should be noted , however , that it is not the magnetic field that destroys the bcs state .",
    "in fact , without electric charge neutrality enforced , the magnetic field would actually increase the value of the gap , since the magnetic moments of the pairing quarks are aligned .",
    "rather , the mismatch of fermi surfaces increases with increasing magnetic field , forcing the gap in the ( locally ) charge neutral phase to get smaller .",
    "thus , the magnetic field has an essential role to play in delineating the conventional clogston - chandrasekhar limit @xmath202 .",
    "0.2 cm    finally , although we have used an effective model with a cutoff , which causes some uncertainty in the calculated values of the quark gap and constituent mass , it is interesting to speculate on possible physical consequences of the large magnetic field , and its effect on the condensates .",
    "at some fixed large value of the local field @xmath53 and in the density window of the metastable regions mentioned above , cooling of two - flavor quark matter below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath203 can result in the formation of domains or nuggets of superconducting regions with different values for the gap , even at constant pressure ( a detailed analysis requires assessment of surface and screening effects in superconducting quark matter  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that once neutrality is imposed , there is no range of density where the chiral and diquark gap co - exist .",
    "the mixed broken phase found in  @xcite does not survive under physical conditions of neutrality .",
    "however , in the chirally broken phase ( where the diquark gap is zero ) , due to the magnetic field , even the chiral gap ( or constituent mass ) oscillates .",
    "we can also imagine that external magnetic fields of order @xmath204 show some local variation on the microscopic scale in the initial stages of the formation of the dense neutron star . in this case , magnetic domains with different magnetization can form . at lower density ,",
    "domains of broken chiral symmetry can also form , hearkening back to the disordered chiral condensate ( dcc ) idea  @xcite .",
    "such kinds of nucleation and domain formation will release latent heat that might be very large owing to the large value of the magnetic field , serving as a large internal engine for possible energetic events on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "such internal mechanisms are unlikely to occur in a pure neutron star without a quark core  @xcite and could have important applications for astrophysics of gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been recently shown that large magnetic fields in strange quark matter introduce anisotropies in bulk viscosities , which can change the stability region of the r - mode in such stars  @xcite and the epoch of gravitational wave emission as the star spins down .",
    "a similar effect may arise in magnetized superconducting two - flavor quark matter , pointing to another important link between the microscopic and astrophysical consequences of a large magnetic field in quark matter in the core of neutron stars .",
