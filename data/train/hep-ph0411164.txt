    "the existence of the preheating stage provides several interesting possibilities such as the gut - scale baryogenesis @xcite , nonthermal phase transition @xcite , the enhancement of metric perturbations @xcite and the formation of primordial black holes @xcite . in the chaotic inflationary scenario characterized by the potential @xmath3",

    "the system enters a fully nonlinear stage after which the mode - mode coupling ( rescattering ) between perturbations is crucially important @xcite .",
    "typically the contribution of the dynamical background field @xmath1 is neglected in standard analysis of particle creations in preheating .",
    "this may be justified for a quadratic inflaton potential , since large - scale @xmath1 modes are exponentially suppressed during inflation for the coupling @xmath10 required for preheating @xcite .",
    "however the situation is different for a quartic inflaton potential with the coupling @xmath10 of order @xmath11 @xcite . in this case",
    "the quasi - homogeneous field @xmath1 can play an important role for the dynamics of preheating .",
    "in fact podolsky and starobinsky @xcite pointed out that chaos may occur for the self - coupling potential @xmath12 when the coupling @xmath13 is not too much larger than of order unity .",
    "since it is not obvious whether chaos actually occurs or not in this model only by analytic estimations , we shall perform detailed numerical investigation with / without the backreaction effect of created particles .",
    "we shall estimate the size of the field @xmath1 at the beginning of reheating by evaluating the amplitude of the @xmath1 fluctuations for the modes larger than the hubble radius . to judge the existence of chaos in preheating",
    "we will adopt several different methods such as the toda - brumer test @xcite , lyapunov exponents @xcite and a fractal map @xcite .",
    "it was already found that chaos appears for hybrid - type inflation models @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "hybrid inflation is a rather special model in a sense that the symmetry breaking field automatically grows by tachyonic instability even if it is suppressed during inflation .",
    "the necessary condition for chaos is that there exist at least two dynamical fields and neither of them is too much smaller than another field .",
    "the hybrid model satisfies this condition , since two fields can have frequencies which are the same order after symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of mixing terms between two fields leads to a new instability of perturbations in addition to tachyonic / resonance instabilities @xcite .",
    "this new type of instability is clearly associated with the presence of chaos .    in this work",

    "we shall numerically solve background equations together with perturbed equations for both quartic ( @xmath4 ) and quadratic ( @xmath7 ) potentials .",
    "our main interest is to find the signature of chaos and the parameter range of the coupling @xmath10 in which chaos can be seen before the backreaction effect of created particles becomes important . since chaos can alter the standard picture of preheating by parametric resonance , it is of interest to clarify the situation in which chaos appears .",
    "recent observations suggest that the quartic potential @xmath14 is under an observational pressure , while the quadratic potential @xmath15 is allowed @xcite .",
    "this depends on the number of @xmath16-folds @xmath17 before the end of inflation at which observable perturbations are generated .",
    "in the case of quartic potential this corresponds to @xmath18 by assuming instant transitions between several cosmological epochs @xcite .",
    "the likelihood analysis including wmap and sdss datasets shows that the quartic potential is marginally allowed by using @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "therefore it is premature to rule out this model completely from current observations .",
    "the quartic potential corresponds to a system in which the background equations can be reduced to the ones in minkowski spacetime by introducing conformal variables .",
    "this has an advantage for the investigation of chaotic dynamics during preheating . as we see later ,",
    "the quartic potential exhibits a stronger chaos compared to the one for the quadratic potential .",

( [ dchik ] ) and ( [ chin=2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the system is expected to enter a chaotic phase after the field is amplified more than @xmath145 times . for the quartic potential",
    "the condition for chaos is not so severe compared to the quadratic potential , since the term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ chin=4 ] ) decreases with time .",
    "it is worth commenting on the difference about the instabilities of chaos and parametric resonance . although the field @xmath1 exhibits an exponential growth by resonance , this is different from the chaotic instability in which the evolution of the system is very sensitive to slight change of initial conditions .",
    "in fact none of the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix is positive in the regime where the condition ( [ chicon ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "this means that chaos is absent in the region @xmath146 even if the field shows an exponential growth by parametric resonance .",
    "since the toda - brumer test is not a sufficient condition for the existence of chaos , we shall use other criteria as well such as lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponents measure the logarithm of of the expansion of a small volume in a @xmath17-dimensional phase space . in this case",
    "the system possesses @xmath17 lyapunov exponents .",
    "chaos is accompanied by an increase of the size of the @xmath17-volume at least in one direction and a maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath147 characterizes the signature of chaos .",
    "when @xmath147 approaches a positive constant asymptotically , this shows the existence of chaos since the initial displacement of the @xmath17-volume grows exponentially .",
    "if @xmath147 approaches to 0 asymptotically , this means the absence of chaos since the orbits are periodic or quasi - periodic . strictly speaking",
    "lyapunov exponents are defined in the limit @xmath148 .",
    "nevertheless one can check the existence of chaos by investigating the behavior of the system for sufficiently large values of @xmath149 .",
    "in fact , as we see later , the maximal lyapunov exponent begins to grow toward a constant value when chaos appears . although the backreaction effect of created particles can alter the background dynamics , it is possible to see the signature of chaos before the backreaction sets in .",
    "in addition to the above two criteria , there exists another criterion for the existence of chaos which is so called a fractal map @xcite .",
    "this strategy is useful because of gauge independence which comes from using a topological character . in the next section",
    "we shall also use this criterion to confirm the presence of chaos in addition to other methods .",

    "our analysis using a fractal map also implies that the system exhibits chaotic behavior when @xmath13 is not too much larger than unity . for larger @xmath13 ,",
    "the backreaction of field fluctuations on sub - hubble scales works earlier than the time at which the toda - brumer test is satisfied for the background field @xmath1 .",
    "we find signatures of chaos for @xmath225 at the linear regime before the backreaction begins to work . for @xmath8 the quasi - homogeneous field",
    "@xmath1 gets smaller at the beginning of preheating , in which case perturbations enter a nonlinear region before chaos can be seen .",
    "the system with a quadratic ( @xmath7 ) potential can not be effectively reduced to the analysis in minkowski spacetime unlike the quartic potential .",
    "we first analyze the preheating dynamics in a frictionless background and then proceed to the case in which the expansion of universe is taken into account . in this model",
    "the background field @xmath1 does not grow sufficiently to satisfy the toda - brumer test in the presence of the backreaction effect of created particles .",
    "we find that this result holds both in minkowski and expanding backgrounds .",
    "therefore chaos can not be observed at least at the linear stage of preheating before the backreaction sets in .",
    "when chaos is present , this means that the second field @xmath1 gives a non - negligible contribution for the background dynamics .",
    "this generally gives a strong correlation between adiabatic and isocurvature metric perturbations @xcite , which can lead to the amplification of curvature perturbations for the self - coupling inflation model @xcite .",
    "this reduces the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath226 , which is favorable from the observational point of view .",
    "of course the ratio @xmath226 is not sufficient to judge whether the model is rescued or not , since large contribution of isocurvature perturbations modifies the cmb power spectrum .",
    "it is still interesting that the appearance of chaos has a possibility to reduce the ratio @xmath226 .    in this work",
    "we did not study the nonlinear dynamics of the system during which the mode - mode coupling between perturbations plays an important role .",
    "we expect that the presence of chaos persists even in such a nonlinear stage provided that two interacting fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dynamically important .",
    "the chaos would finally disappear after the energy densities of scalar fields are converted to that of radiation .",
    "it is of interest to extend our analysis to such a regime including born decays of scalar fields for a complete understanding of chaos in reheating .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank kei - ichi maeda and alexei starobinsky for useful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant for the 21st century coe program ( holistic research and education center for physics self - organization systems ) at waseda university .",
