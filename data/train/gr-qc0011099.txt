    "the general theory of relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves . since gravity couples very weakly to matter , highly sensitive detectors are required to detect gravitational waves . over the next decade several large - scale interferometric gravitational wave detectors will come on - line .",
    "these include the ligo , composed of two interferometric detectors situated in the united states each with baselines of 4 km , virgo , an italian / french project located near pisa with a baseline of 3 km , geo600 , a british / german interferometer under construction near hannover with a baseline of 600 m , tama in japan , a medium - scale laser interferometer with a baseline of 300 m and with funding approval aigo500 , the proposed 500 m project sponsored by aciga @xcite .",
    "the large scale interferometers will use fabry - perot cavities and the ground based detectors will have arm lengths of few kilometers .",
    "there are several noise sources which plague the detector . amongst them , the photon shot noise is dominant at high frequencies .",
    "it is reduced by increasing the amount of power of the laser source , as the noise is inversely proportional to the square root of the power .",
    "therefore the cavities envisaged will operate with very high powers in their arms , tens of kilowatts for initial detectors and perhaps powers as high as megawatts in planned advanced detectors .",
    "the high power stored in the cavities can generate a number of nonlinear effects which would adversely affect the operation of the optical cavity . here , we look into one such effect , namely , the dynamics of mirrors under the radiation pressure force . in earlier literature",
    ", we and others had investigated the thermo - elastic deformation of the mirrors due to the absorption of the power in the coatings and performed a longitudinal analysis of the cavity @xcite . following these investigations",
    ", we studied the effects of radiation pressure in the cavity , in the regime when the displacement of the mirror is small compared with the line - width of the cavity , the cavity is servoed at resonance with a realistic servo control and the variation in the radiation pressure force is linearly dependent on the displacement@xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure effects have also been investigated in earlier literature @xcite . here",
    ", however , since we now have a reasonably good idea about the instrumental parameters to be used in the large scale detectors , we expect that our analysis here will be important to the experimentalists .",
    "we assume that the mirrors are hanging ` freely ' ( there is no active servo control ) and the radiation pressure exerts force on them which displaces them from resonance .",
    "it is very important for people involved in the experiments being built to have a quantitative idea of the magnitude of these effects .",
    "for instance , it would be necessary to take into account these effects and modify the servo transfer functions to be used for the control of the experiments .",
    "the main result of this paper is to establish that the freely hanging mirrors continuously gain energy and swing with ever increasing amplitude when subjected to radiation pressure force arising from the light field .",
    "this result seems to be in opposition with the results of meystre et al . , who found in @xcite a mirror confinement due to the radiation pressure .",
    "the reason for this difference of behaviour is the ` time delay ' effect which is also examined in detail in this paper .",
    "the time delay is large for the long ( kilometric ) cavities , primarily studied here , while it can be neglected for short cavities such as the one studied by meystre et al . @xcite and those used in most of labs .",
    "closed form expressions have been given which facilitate in understanding the physics of the phenomenon .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : + in section ii , we set up the equation of motion of the free mirrors .",
    "we examine the motion of the mirrors with the two forces @xmath0 the radiation pressure force , @xmath1 the force of gravity . in section iii",
    ", we numerically integrate the equations of motion using the so called ` phase space method ' .",
    "we present the results for the particular case , when the mirrors are in the resonance positions and the laser is switched on .",
    "we observe that the amplitude of the motion of the mirrors increases with time and energy is pumped into the system . for very large times , when the amplitude of the system is also very large , so that the mirrors cross several of the fabry - perot resonances in one cycle of the pendulum , the motion approximates to that of an anti - damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "we give also , for comparison , the numerical results obtained for a short cavity : no anti - damping is exhibited in this case , in agreement with earlier results @xcite . in section iv , we obtain analytically , under the quasi - static approximation , the phase space trajectories of the motion of the individual mirrors as well as the motion in the differential mode and the common mode ( the centre of mass mode ) .",
    "the analytical results match with the numerical ones remarkably . in section",
    "v , we give a quantitative description of the phenomenon under the assumption that the velocity of the mirror does not change very much on the time scale of the storage time of the cavity .",
    "we find that the gain in energy is due to a differential radiation pressure force arising from the asymmetry , according as the mirrors are approaching each other or moving away from each other .",
    "we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the differential force , the time ` delay ' and then proceed to compute the gain in energy per cycle when the mirrors encounter a single resonance or cross several resonances . for large amplitudes , when the mirrors cross several resonances , the system behaves like an anti - damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "we can then associate an effective negative @xmath2-factor for the system .",
    "we show that the @xmath2-factor depends on the input power , the finesse of the cavity and the round trip time of the cavity . finally in section vi , we study the behaviour of the system when it is initially in equilibrium and goes out of lock .",
    "this may happen when the servo loop is suddenly opened .",
    "we consider only ` free ' mirrors meaning that no servo control loop is used .",
    "the only forces acting on the mirrors are the radiation pressure force and gravity which manifests itself as the restoring force of the pendulum . we consider a single cavity with mirrors @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are suspended as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the input beam @xmath5 enters the cavity from mirror @xmath3 and bounces back and forth between the two mirrors .",
    "after several round trips , whose number is of the order of the finesse of the cavity , the field builds up inside the cavity .",
    "the magnitude of the field depends on the finesse of the cavity , the input power and the detuning of the cavity .",
    "the field or the power produces the radiation pressure force which pushes on the mirrors , driving them apart , thus changing the distance between the two .",
    "this in turn changes the power inside the cavity .",
    "for instance , if the mirrors were hanging in a position of resonance , the radiation pressure force drives the cavity out of resonance , reducing the radiation pressure force .",
    "the mirrors start swinging with radiation pressure force adjusting to the continuously varying length of the cavity .",
    "it is found that the radiation pressure force does not adjust instantaneously to the new length but _ lags _ behind the expected static force given by the fabry - perot curve ( the airy function ) by a time - lag comparable to the storage time of the cavity .",
    "the time - lag has been called ` time delay ' in earlier literature @xcite .",
    "the slowly varying amplitude of the field inside the cavity at time @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 satisfies the following equation , @xmath8 + r b(t-\\tau)\\exp[ikl(t)],\\ ] ] where , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the positions , reflectivities and transmitivitties of the mirrors @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the wavelength of the laser light , @xmath16 is the round trip time and @xmath17 in case of the virgo cavity , the arm length @xmath18 is 3 km , the round trip time @xmath19 seconds , where @xmath20 is the speed of light .",
    "this equation provides an iterative relation between the field amplitude at time @xmath6 to the field amplitude at time @xmath21 and the positions of the mirrors .",
    "we investigate the following two situations :    1 .",
    "the mirrors are hanging in the positions of resonance and the laser is switched on at the time @xmath22 .",
    "the mirrors are hanging in an equilibrium state with the radiation pressure force balancing the restoring force of the suspension .",
    "situation 1 represents a possible experiment .",
    "when the servo - control is not operating , the mirrors will be freely in motion .",
    "then , when the laser is switched on , the radiation pressure will affect the motion of the mirrors .",
    "however , here , we mainly deal with the case ( as given in 1 ) , when the mirrors are initially at rest and in the resonance position .",
    "however , many of our analytical formulae , for example , that of ` time - delay ' apply to more general situations . + situation 2 describes the case when the interferometer is already in operation .",
    "now if the servo - control loop is suddenly opened , the system will tend to become unstable .",
    "this case is also investigated .",
    "the equations of motion for the mirrors correspond to forced harmonic oscillator with the forcing term arising from the radiation pressure force .",
    "we first compute the radiation pressure forces on each mirror . for mirror @xmath3 , the radiation pressure force",
    "comprises of two terms , electric field due the input laser beam , @xmath5 and the intra - cavity field @xmath23 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the radiation pressure force on @xmath3 is , @xmath24,\\ ] ] where , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath27 is the fraction of average number of photons reflected by @xmath28 th mirror for @xmath12 respectively . + for @xmath4 , the radiation pressure force is given by @xmath29 the equations of motion for the mirrors with the masses , natural frequencies and damping constants , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; @xmath12 , respectively , are @xmath33 = f_{i}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the initial position of the mirror such that the separation between the mirrors before switching on the laser is @xmath35 . the full system of equations to be evolved in time are the equations from ( 1 ) to ( 5 ) ( non - linearly coupled equations ) . in section iii ,",
    "we first carry out the task numerically and in later sections , after we have gained sufficient physical insight into the problem , we shall present the semi - analytical results .",
    "for the numerical calculation , we consider the virgo parameters for the suspension and the optical cavity .",
    "we assume @xmath36 kg . , @xmath37 rad./sec . which corresponds to a resonant frequency of about 0.6 hz . the @xmath2 factor for the suspension is typically of the order of @xmath38 .",
    "the optical parameters are @xmath39 sec . ,",
    "the wavelength of the carrier wave @xmath40 m , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the wave number is @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we examine the behaviour of the system with the input power varying between 1 kw to 30 kw .",
    "initial detectors will be operated at input powers @xmath45 1 kw and advanced detectors at powers of few hundred kw or even upto a mw .",
    "note that these are the input powers for the main cavities after power recycling has been implemented .    with the above values for the parameters , we find that the instabilities set in , on the time - scales of few seconds to few hundred seconds . since the @xmath2-factor of the pendulum suspension is so large , the damping in the oscillations can be neglected for the numerical integrations carried over the time intervals @xmath46 seconds .",
    "most of our numerical integrations range from few seconds to at most few thousands of seconds . neglecting damping ,",
    "the equations of motion for the mirrors become , @xmath47 the equations of motion of the mirrors are non - linear differential equations and can not be solved by simple methods .",
    "we integrate the equations by the so called ` phase space method ' described below : + let @xmath48 be the time - step of integration .",
    "the natural time step we assume is @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that the forcing term is a constant during each time step .",
    "this assumption is not unrealistic because the round trip time interval for the virgo cavity is of the order of @xmath50 seconds ; note that this approximation will hold _ a fortiori _ for more common ( much shorter ) cavities .",
    "the equations simplify enormously under this assumption .",
    "thus we can integrate the equations exactly within this time interval .",
    "+ the evolution of the equations goes as follows : @xmath51 @xmath52 where we have dropped the indices 1,2 for simplicity and @xmath53 . here , @xmath54 represents the displacement from the mean position @xmath55 . the index @xmath56 represents the value of the variable at the time @xmath57 , i.e. for example , @xmath58 .",
    "the optical component has the following iterative evolution : @xmath59}{mc},\\ ] ] @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 this scheme solves the system of equations .",
    "since it is the length of the cavity that actually matters for this problem , we define the variable , @xmath64 - k l_{0},\\ ] ] and present the results in phase space plots of @xmath65 vs @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is called the differential mode .",
    "we first consider the case when the mirrors are hanging in the resonance position and the laser is switched on . as the power builds up , the radiation pressure acts on the mirrors , driving them apart resulting in the detuning of the cavity .",
    "this reduces the radiation pressure force and the mirrors swing back .",
    "the motion is oscillatory and as we note , the oscillations increase in amplitude .",
    "we employ two values of input power namely , 1 kw ( initial virgo ) and 30 kw corresponding to advanced detectors .",
    "the results are presented by the phase space trajectories of the mirrors .",
    "we consider four variables for the purpose , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath66 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath70 , defined later in the text in eq .",
    "( 24 ) , section iv - b , is called the common mode . for",
    "the range of powers considered 1 kw to 30 kw , the phase space curves obtained from numerical simulations , for few tens of seconds are qualitatively the same .",
    "+ we make the following general observations about the features :    1 .",
    "we observe from figs.4 and 5 that the radius of the phase space curve increases with every cycle which indicates that the mirrors continuously gain energy from the input laser beam implying that the system is nonconservative .",
    "we also observe that the gain per cycle is not constant but some sort of a periodic function of the radius of the phase space diagram .",
    "we shall consider this phenomenon in detail in section v. 2 .",
    "the ( static ) radiation pressure force peaks when the cavity is in resonance and drops down to zero when it is out of resonance , ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the radiation pressure force @xmath71 is about @xmath72 rad , corresponding to the fwhm of the cavity resonance curve for a finesse of 50 .",
    "hence , for the initial stretch of the phase space trajectory , the mirrors experience the radiation pressure force whereas during the rest of the time , they only experience the restoring force ( and the force due to the input power for @xmath3 ) .",
    "the phase - space trajectory is circular during the restoring force regime and is deformed away from the circularity when the mirrors encounter the appreciable amount of radiation pressure near resonance ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "since the laser is beamed in the positive @xmath54-direction , there is an asymmetry about the origin .",
    "this shifts the centre of mass trajectory to the positive side of the @xmath54 axis ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the period of oscillation of the common mode is twice that of the period of the differential mode of the system ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "if we let the laser beam pump in energy for large amounts of time , the amplitude also becomes large and the mirrors sweep across several resonances .",
    "the phase space trajectory then tends to become more and more circular and the motion approximates to that of a simple harmonic motion .",
    "this feature can be observed in all the four modes .",
    "the circularity of the trajectory implies that the motion is almost ` free ' .",
    "the radiation pressure force has little effect because the mirrors sweep too quickly across the resonances for it to affect their motion .",
    "however , as we shall see that the steady gain in energy still persists .",
    "figure 5 depicts this phenomenon .",
    "the amount of energy imparted to mirror 2 by the laser beam after getting reflected , is more than to mirror 1 .",
    "thus m2 swings with larger amplitude as compared to m1 ( see fig.4 ) ( the radiation force is larger on m2 ) . 6",
    ".   let s turn now to the dynamics of a short cavity .",
    "the fig.6 shows the space of phase trajectory for the differential mode @xmath66 , for a short cavity of length @xmath73 cm ( instead of 3 km for the other examples ) and with the same optical and mechanical parameters and initial conditions as in fig.5 obtained with the 3 km long cavity .",
    "the round - trip time is here @xmath74 s , and the simulation lasts for 500 s ( corresponding to a huge number of round trips in the cavity ) . at the contrary of the kilometric cavity ,",
    "see fig.5 , no energy gain is found .",
    "this is in accord with the results of meystre et al .",
    ", who have previously developped a theory of radiation - pressure driven cavities @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this difference of behaviour between a short ( common ) cavity and a kilometric one is precisely due to the difference of length , as explained in the following sections .",
    "time delay effects are thus of utmost importance for very long cavities , while they can be neglected for usual ones ( and so have been neglected in meystre s theory @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we obtain approximate closed form expressions for the equations of the phase space trajectories for about a period of one cycle . for the virgo case ,",
    "this turns out to be between one or two seconds",
    ". this analysis could be useful in the context of the initial locking of the cavity .",

    "when @xmath66 is small that is near resonance , the equation of the trajectory reduces to @xmath91 thus the trajectory is parabolic in shape and passes through the origin .",
    "2 .   when @xmath92 , the trajectory is a circle as expected since there is hardly any radiation pressure force acting on the mirrors .",
    "the equation of the trajectory in this regime is @xmath93    when the input power is very large @xmath94 kw , the trajectory does not maintain this simple shape .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath95 kw , the trajectory is as shown in fig.8 .",
    "this is because the high powers make the mirrors cross several resonances in the first cycle itself and consequently the trajectory has more complex behaviour .",
    "we do not pursue this case here .      in this sub - section",
    ", we study the motion of the center of mass of the system of two mirrors .",

    "the above equation is a second order differential equation and is coupled nontrivially to the @xmath66 mode .",
    "the strategy we adopt is to study the motion of the center of mass in different regimes ; ( 1 ) near the resonance and ( 2 ) away from the resonance .",

    "the phase space curve is more steeper in the common mode as compared to the differential mode .",

    ", the power stored inside the cavity is almost zero .",
    "the equation of motion of the center of mass is given by , @xmath113 + the solution for the initial conditions @xmath114 is , @xmath115    this solution must be matched to the solution in case 1 .",
    "suppose we match the solution at @xmath116 , from equation ( 29 ) we have @xmath117 .",
    "this gives the approximate solution .",
    "in general , the solution in this region is , @xmath118    the equations ( 29 ) and ( 33 ) describe the full solution for this mode .",
    "the phase space trajectory for the individual mirrors can be obtained from the motion of the mirrors in the differential and the common modes .",
    "the trajectories of the @xmath119 and @xmath120 modes are shown in figures 2 and 4 .",
    "in the previous section , we examined the motion of the mirrors under the radiation pressure force .",
    "we noted that each time when the mirrors cross a resonance they experience an impulsive force . in this section , we analyze in detail as to how the system gains energy as each resonance is encountered .",
    "we start with the quasi - static approximation in which the system is conservative , thus there is no net gain in energy .",
    "we then phenomenologically introduce the ` time delay ' , @xmath121 which now leads to gain in energy .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath121 in terms of the cavity parameters and this gives us an equation for an anti - damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the energy gain can be obtained as shown in the following sections .",
    "finally , for large times , the gain can be expressed through a negative @xmath2 of a harmonic oscillator . in the quasi - static approximation",

    "however , we note from the results of numerical simulations that the system indeed gains energy with every cycle of oscillation . moreover , this gain occurs when the radiation pressure force is appreciable i.e. when the system is near resonance .",
    "most importantly , we observe from the numerical simulations that radiation pressure force lags behind its quasi - static value by a ` time - lag ' which we denote by @xmath121 .",
    "we find that in the case of virgo , @xmath121 varies from about @xmath133 to @xmath134 as one climbs up the resonance curve from half its maximum to the maximum .",
    "@xmath121 is of the order of the storage time of the cavity . with this in mind",

    "is responsible to the gain / loss of energy of the system .",
    "this solely depends on the sign of @xmath139 since @xmath121 is always positive .",

    "but since the radiation pressure force always gives a kick in the positive -@xmath66 direction , the @xmath146 is always larger when @xmath144 . in other words , the amount of energy gained by the system is more than the amount of energy lost .",
    "hence , there is always a net gain in energy when the system crosses a resonance .",

    "we obtain , @xmath148 we note that @xmath147 depends on the phase velocity and @xmath139 .",
    "since @xmath149 when the system is away from resonance , @xmath147 comes into play only in the region of resonance .",
    "another way of describing the fundamental asymmetry is to say that for the moving mirror , the wavelength of the laser light is modified by the doppler effect",
    ". when the mirrors are approaching each other , the apparent frequency of the light for the cavity is increased , or equivalently , the line - width of the cavity seen from the laboratory frame is narrower and vice versa when the mirrors move away from one another , the line - width is seen to be broader .",
    "the consequence is that the braking force ( when the mirrors move against the light ) acts for a shorter time than the accelerating force , when the mirrors are moving away from each other .",

    "since the @xmath286 , the rate of increase of @xmath252 per cycle , denoted by @xmath287 is given by @xmath288 .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that for large values of @xmath252 , the amount of energy gained by the system of two mirrors per cycle is a constant and tends to @xmath276 .",
    "the system is an anti - damped harmonic oscillator which gains on an average , constant amount of energy per cycle .",
    "we may therefore associate a _ negative _ quality factor @xmath289 , where @xmath290 , with the system which describes the anti - damping .",
    "in this section , we endeavor to study the behaviour of @xmath2 . + the equation of motion of an anti - damped harmonic oscillator is given by , @xmath291 where @xmath2 is constant .",

    "is gained per cycle , the @xmath2 will be a function of time .",
    "however , we can still describe the system by an average @xmath2 taken over a cycle , which we denote by @xmath296 , since the change in @xmath2 during one cycle is small .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath297 i.e. the fractional variation of @xmath296 over a period of a cycle can be ignored .",

    "@xmath309 depends through @xmath276 on the input power , finesse and the round trip time .    for @xmath264 kw of input power ,",
    "the trajectory more or less obtains a circular shape when @xmath310 . for the virgo parameters , @xmath311 thus @xmath312 and so @xmath313",
    "further , if we also consider the effect of the damping of the suspension then the limit cycle will be approached when @xmath314 for virgo .",
    "@xmath296 will attain this value after @xmath315 which corresponds to little more than 3 days .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is given by , @xmath316^{1/2 } \\sim 1100.\\ ] ]    this simple analysis will have to be modified when the limit cycle is almost reached , that is when , @xmath317 . here , however our goal was to estimate the time it takes to reach this stage .",
    "the above analysis is then adequate for the purpose .",
    "however , when the servo operates or otherwise such a situation is unlikely to arise because other effects such as mirror tilting etc . will be important long before and then the dynamics will be completely different .",
    "lastly , we examine the case when the mirrors are in equilibrium under the radiation pressure force and the restoring force .",
    "we have to determine whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable . to this end , we perturb the equation ( 41 ) about a given equilibrium point . writing @xmath318 and linearizing , we get , @xmath319 where , @xmath320 and @xmath321 if @xmath322 , @xmath323 , the sign of @xmath324 does not matter and the instability grows exponentially . if on the other hand @xmath325 , then although @xmath326 , @xmath327 and this leads to gradually growing oscillations until the pendulum tips over the maximum .",
    "we plot the phase space trajectory for the input power of 1 kw in fig.11 .",
    "we conclude from this that the cavity is _ always _ unstable when radiation pressure forces act .",
    "the time - delay plays a crucial role in making the system unstable .",
    "the negative q - factor for the motion of the mirrors near the equilibrium position , is given by , @xmath328    for an input power of 30 kw , with virgo cavity parameters , the equilibrium position of the mirrors near the resonance at zero is @xmath329 .",
    "the corresponding values of the other quantities are @xmath330 and @xmath331 seconds . the negative q - factor , @xmath332 .",
    "whereas for initial virgo , @xmath333 kw , @xmath334 thus @xmath335 , @xmath336 seconds , the negative q - factor , @xmath337 .",
    "we have analysed the effect of radiation pressure on the freely hanging mirrors ( no servo loop ) suspended in the laser interferometric optical cavities . after numerically evolving the full set of equations of motion with respect to time , we find that the amplitude of the mirror oscillations continuously increases as time progresses .",
    "we introduce the ` time delay ' , that is the time taken for field to adjust to the motion of the mirrors , in a phenomenological way to explain the observed gain .",
    "we conclude that the gain in energy is due to the differential radiation pressure force arising from the asymmetry depending upon the motion of the mirrors . from another viewpoint",
    ", we can also explain the gain in energy qualitatively by the doppler effect .",
    "with respect to the mirror , the frequency of the incoming laser beam is higher as compared to that of the outgoing laser beam due to the doppler effect .",
    "the deficit of the energy of the laser beam after getting reflected from the mirror can be looked upon as the energy gained by the mirrors .",
    "the values of the energy gain per cycle are computed analytically under the reasonable assumption that the mirrors are not accelerated within the time scale of the storage time of the cavity . for virgo parameters ,",
    "the analytical values agree remarkably with the numerical values . the interesting point to note",
    "is that the motion of the mirrors approaches that of an anti - damped harmonic oscillator with a constant gain in energy as time progresses which implies that the mirrors move too quickly to get affected by the radiation pressure force .",
    "the negative q - factor of the anti - damped oscillator depends on the input power , the finesse and the round trip time of the cavity and increases linearly as a function of time .",
    "the analysis will have to be modified when the negative q - factor becomes of the order of the damping q - factor of the suspension fibre , if such a case can arise .",
    "+ in this paper , we have shown that the radiation pressure force makes the freely hanging mirror unstable _ for all values of the input power and irrespective of the initial conditions . _",
    "+ the above analysis is relevant in the event , when the interferometer is in operation and if the servo loop is suddenly opened .",
    "then the motion of the hanging mirrors can be deduced from the above analysis",
    ". this analysis will be helpful in designing a servo - control which can prevent this instability . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "the servo - control was included in the linear regime of the fabry - perot curve assuming the transfer function for the servo given by caron et al .",
    "their work sets the stage for analysing the system in the non - linear regime as well , but it is then needed to know how servo - control operates in the full regime .",
