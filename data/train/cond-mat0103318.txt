    "statistical mechanics @xcite is a theory developed at the end of nineteenth century to deal with physical systems from an atomistic point of view . in principle",
    "the properties of bulk matter , which may contain @xmath0 atoms , can be worked out from the motion of atoms following the basic equations of newtonian mechanics or quantum mechanics . however , such detailed information is not available or not really necessary .",
    "a probabilistic point of view , in the form of statistical ensemble is taken .",
    "the theory is extremely economical and successful in dealing with _ equilibrium _ problems .",
    "there are a number of equivalent formulations of the theory .",
    "but statistical mechanics in a nutshell is the following concise formula that connects statistical mechanics with thermodynamics .",
    "first the partition function is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a `` state '' of the system ; the summation is carried over all possible states .",
    "@xmath3 is absolute temperature and @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant ( @xmath5 joule / kelvin ) .",
    "the free energy of the system at temperature @xmath3 is given by @xmath6 free energy is a useful thermodynamic quantity in dealing with phase transitions .",
    "other macroscopic observables are averages of the corresponding microscopic quantities over the boltzmann - gibbs weight @xmath7 , @xmath8 the following three quantities are perhaps the most important ones , internal energy @xmath9 , heat capacity @xmath10 , and entropy @xmath11 , where the average is over the gibbs probability density , @xmath12 .",
    "the essential task in statistical mechanics is to do the multi - dimensional integrations ( for continuous systems ) or summations ( for discrete systems ) . to fix the notation and language",
    ", we briefly introduce the basics of monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "consider the computation of a statistical average , @xmath13 where the probability density obeys @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that we can generate samples @xmath16 according to the probability @xmath17 , then the integral can be estimated from an arithmetic mean over the samples , @xmath18 the random variable @xmath19 has mean @xmath20 and standard deviation @xmath21 , @xmath22 being decorrelation time .",
    "thus in the limit of large number of samples , the estimate converges to the exact value .",
    "the most general method to generate @xmath2 according to @xmath17 is given by a markov chain @xcite with a transition probability @xmath23 , satisfying the conditions stated below .",
    "this is the probability of generating a new state @xmath24 given that the current state is @xmath2 .",
    "such process converges if @xmath25 the equilibrium distribution of the markov chain satisfies @xmath26 in constructing a monte carlo algorithm , it is convenient to consider a much stronger condition , the detailed balance @xmath27    one of the most famous and widely used monte carlo algorithms is the metropolis importance sampling algorithm @xcite .",
    "it takes a simple choice of the transition matrix : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is a conditional probability of choosing @xmath24 given that the current value is @xmath2 , and it is symmetric , @xmath31 . usually @xmath32 unless @xmath24 is in some `` neighborhood '' of @xmath2 .",
    "the diagonal term of @xmath33 is fixed by the normalization condition @xmath34 .",
    "in order to facilitate the discussion we first introduce the ising model .",
    "ising model is an interacting many - particle model for magnets .",
    "a state consists of a collection of variables @xmath35 taken on only two possible values @xmath36 and @xmath37 , signifying the spin up and spin down states .",
    "the spins are on a lattice .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant which fixes the energy scale , the summation is over the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "when temperature @xmath3 is specified , the states are distributed according to @xmath41    in a local monte carlo dynamics ( metropolis algorithm ) , one picks a site @xmath42 at random , i.e. , choosing a site with equal probability ( this specifies or realizes @xmath30 ) .",
    "then , the energy increment if the spin is flipped , @xmath43 , is computed , which has the result @xmath44 .",
    "the flip is accepted with probability @xmath45 . if the flip is rejected , the move is also counted and the state remains unchanged .",
    "one monte carlo step is defined as @xmath46 moves ( trials ) for a system of @xmath46 spins , such that each spin is attempted to flip once on average .",
    "the local algorithm of metropolis type has some salient features : ( 1 ) it is extremely general .",
    "less assumption is made of the specific form of probability distribution .",
    "( 2 ) each move involves @xmath47 operations and @xmath47 degrees of freedom .",
    "( 3 ) the dynamics suffers from critical slowing down .",
    "the correlation time @xmath22 diverges as a critical temperature is approached .",
    "we shall elaborate more on this in the following .",
    "the statistical error , using estimator eq .  ( [ estimator ] ) , is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the variance of the observable , @xmath50 is the number of monte carlo steps , and @xmath22 is the decorrelation time .",
    "we can take the point of view that the above equation defines @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath51 perhaps it is appropriate to call @xmath22 decorrelation time , since @xmath52 is sometimes called correlation time in the literature .",
    "the decorrelation time @xmath22 is the minimum number of monte carlo steps needed to generate effectively independent , identically distributed samples in the markov chain .",
    "the smallest possible value for @xmath22 is 1 , which represents independent sample by every step .",
    "the usual integrated autocorrelation time @xcite differs from our definition by a factor of 2 , @xmath53 .",
    "the critical slowing down manifests itself by the fact that @xmath54 at the critical temperature @xmath55 where a second order phase transition occurs . here",
    "@xmath56 is the linear dimension of the system ( @xmath57 in @xmath58 dimensions ) . for the local algorithms for many models and in any dimensions , @xmath59",
    "this suggests bad convergence , specially for large systems . at a first - order phase transition , where some thermodynamic variables change discontinuously ,",
    "the situation is even worse  @xmath22 diverges exponentially with system sizes .    for the two - dimensional ising model , a phase transition occurs @xcite at @xmath60 .",
    "the magnetization is non - zero below this temperature and becomes zero above @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , in the limit of large system ( @xmath61 ) , heat capacity per spin and fluctuation of magnetization diverge .",
    "these intrinsic properties make computer simulation near critical point very difficult .",
    "cluster algorithms @xcite overcome this difficulty successfully .",
    "for example , for the two - dimensional ising model , the dynamical critical exponent defined in @xmath62 is reduced from 2.17 for the single - spin flip @xcite to much small value for the cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a precise characterization of the swendsen - wang dynamical critical exponent is very difficult , due to weak size dependence of the decorrelation time .",
    "table  1 represents a recent extensive calculation , based on the definition eq .",
    "( [ tau - def ] ) for the total energy , rather than the usual method of extracting information from time - dependent auto - correlation functions . in this calculation ,",
    "the variance of the sum of @xmath50 consecutive energies ( c.f . eq .",
    "( [ estimator ] ) ) are computed explicitly .",
    "good convergence to the limiting value is already achieved typically for @xmath63 .",
    "an @xmath64 extrapolation is used to get more accurate estimates of the limit . from this calculation",
    ", we find for the two - dimensional ising model , the convergence to asymptotics are slow .",
    "it appears that the divergence is slightly faster than @xmath65 .",
    "if we fit to power law @xmath66 , using two consecutive sizes of @xmath56 and @xmath67 , the exponent @xmath68 decreases from 0.35 to 0.21 .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath68 will convergence to a finite value or continue decreasing to 0 in the limit of @xmath61 .",
    "the nonlocal cluster algorithm introduced by swendsen and wang for the the ising model ( and more generally the potts model ) goes as follows : ( 1 ) go over each nearest neighbor pair and create a bond with probability @xmath69 that is , if the two nearest neighbor spins are the same , a bond is created between them with probability @xmath70 ; if spin values are different , there will be no bond .",
    "( 2 ) identify clusters as a set of sites connected by zero or more bonds ( i.e. , connected component of a graph ) .",
    "relabel each cluster with a fresh new value @xmath36 or @xmath37 at random .",
    "we note that each monte carlo step per spin still takes @xmath47 in computational cost .",
    "the method is applicable to models containing ising symmetry , i.e. , the energy is the same when @xmath35 is changed to @xmath71 globally .",
    "the algorithm is based on a mapping of ising model to a random cluster model of percolation . specifically , we have @xcite @xmath72 \\\\      & = & \\sum_{\\{n\\ } } p^b ( 1 - p)^{nd - b } 2^{n_{\\mathrm{c } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath76 is the number of bonds , @xmath58 is the dimension of a simple hypercubic lattice , and @xmath77 is the number of clusters .",
    "@xmath35 is spin on the site and @xmath78 is the bond variable between the sites @xmath42 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is evident that the moves in the swendsen - wang algorithm preserves configuration probability of the augmented model containing both the spins and bonds .",
    "a single cluster variant due to wolff @xcite is very easy to program .",
    "the following c code generates and flip one cluster :    ....        # define z   4        # define l   8        double p = 0.7 ;        int s[l*l ] ;          void flip(int i , int s0 )        {           int j , nn[z ] ;             s[i ] = - s0 ;           neighbor(i , nn ) ;           for(j = 0 ; j < z ; + + j )              if(s0 = = s[nn[j ] ] & & drand48 ( ) < p )                 flip(nn[j ] , s0 ) ;        } ....    in this single cluster version , a site @xmath42 is selected at random .",
    "the value of the spin before flip is @xmath80 .",
    "it flips the spin and looks for its neighbors .",
    "if the value of the neighbor spins are the same as @xmath80 , with probability @xmath81 a neighbor site becomes part of the cluster .",
    "this is performed recursively .",
    "it turns out that single cluster is somewhat more efficient than the original swendsen - wang , particularly in high dimensions . for dimensions greater than or equal to 4 ,",
    "swendsen - wang dynamics gives the dynamic critical exponent @xmath82 , while wolff single cluster is @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see why the single cluster algorithm of the above works .",
    "let us consider a general cluster flip algorithm with two bond probabilities : @xmath84 will be the probability of connecting two parallel spin sites ; @xmath85 the probability of connecting anti - parallel sites . consider the transition between two configurations @xmath86 and @xmath87 , characterized by flipping a cluster @xmath88 .",
    "a cluster is growing from a site @xmath42 until the perimeter of the cluster is not connected to the outside .",
    "the transition probabilities can be written down as @xmath89 note that the bond configuration probabilities are the same in the interior of the clusters .",
    "the difference occurs at the boundary @xmath90 , where parallel spins ( @xmath91 ) in @xmath86 becomes anti - parallel spins ( @xmath92 ) in @xmath87 , or vice versa .",
    "detailed balance requires that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of parallel spins on boundary of @xmath88 in configuration @xmath86 ; and @xmath95 is the number of anti - parallel spins on boundary of @xmath88 in configuration @xmath86 .",
    "since we have @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 although the algorithm is valid for any @xmath98 , it is most efficient at @xmath99 , the coniglio - klein @xcite bond probability value",
    ".    a quite large number of statistical models can be treated with cluster algorithms , with varied success .",
    "excellent performance has been obtained for ising model , potts models , and antiferromagnetic potts models @xcite , xy model and general @xmath100 models @xcite , @xmath101 field - theoretic model @xcite , some regularly frustrated models @xcite , six - vertex model @xcite , etc .",
    "cluster algorithms are proposed for hard sphere fluid systems @xcite , quantum systems @xcite , microcanonical ensembles @xcite , conserved order parameters @xcite , etc . invaded cluster algorithm @xcite and other proposal @xcite",
    "are excellent methods for locating critical points .",
    "the cluster algorithms are also used in image processing @xcite .",
    "the cluster algorithms do not help much in temperature - driven first - order phase transition  the slow convergence has been shown rigorously @xcite .",
    "models with frustration , spin glass being the archetype , do not have efficient cluster algorithms , although there are attempts @xcite with limited success .",
    "breakthrough in this area will have a major impact on the simulation methods .",
    "in this and the following sections , we discuss a class of monte carlo simulation approaches that aim at an efficient use of data collected , and sampling methods that enhance rare events .",
    "the computation of free energy , eq .  ( [ free - energy ] ) , poses a difficult problem for monte carlo method .",
    "a traditional method is to use thermodynamic integration , e.g. , @xmath102 based on the relation @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",
    "if we can estimate the density of states ( the number of states with a given energy @xmath105 for discrete energy models ) , then we can compute free energy , as well as thermodynamic averages .",
    "the result is obtained as a function of temperature @xmath3 , rather than a single datum point for a specific value of @xmath3 , as in standard monte carlo simulation .",
    "this idea has been pursued over the last decade by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite , berg et al @xcite , lee @xcite , oliveira et al @xcite , and wang @xcite .",
    "consider the following decomposition of summations over the states @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the microcanonical ensemble average , @xmath108 since the state space is exponentially large ( @xmath109 for the ising model with @xmath46 spins ) , and the range of @xmath105 is typically of order @xmath46 , if @xmath110 can be computed accurately , the task is done .",
    "the canonical average of @xmath86 is related to the microcanonical average through @xmath111 and free energy is computed as @xmath112      ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite popularized a method which in a sense is to compute the density of states ( up to a multiplicative constant ) in a range close to a given simulation temperature .",
    "this method is generalized as multiple histogram method to combine simulations at differential temperatures , to get the whole energy range @xcite .",
    "we discuss here only the single histogram method for its simplicity .    during a normal canonical simulation at fixed temperature @xmath113",
    ", we collect the histogram of energy , @xmath114 , which is proportional to probability distribution of energy , @xmath115 the constant @xmath116 is related to the partition function , @xmath117 , where @xmath50 is the total number of samples collected . from the above equation , we find @xmath118 . with this information , we can compute the free energy difference between temperature @xmath113 and a nearby temperature @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , moments of energy can be computed after the simulation , through histogram reweighting , @xmath119    the range of @xmath105 that the histogram data can be collected at a fixed temperature is limited by the energy distribution , which for the canonical distribution away from critical point , is of order of @xmath120 .",
    "the whole range of energy @xmath105 is of order @xmath46 .",
    "this limit the usefulness of single histogram method .",
    "the multicanonical monte carlo method has been shown to be very effective to overcome supercritical slowing down , reducing the relaxation time from exponential divergence with respect to system size to a power , at the first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "multicanonical ensemble flattens out the energy distribution , so that the computation of the density of states @xmath110 can be done for all values of @xmath105 .",
    "a multicanonical ensemble is defined to following the probability density for the states as @xmath121 such that the energy histogram @xmath114 ( @xmath122 ) is a constant . from the histogram samples obtained by a simulation with the weight of state at energy @xmath105 as @xmath123 , the density of state",
    "can be computed @xcite from @xmath124 . however , unlike canonical simulation where @xmath125 is given , in a multicanonical simulation , @xmath123 is unknown to start with .",
    "berg proposed an iterative method to compute the weight in a parametrized form @xmath126 , starting with no information , @xmath127 . a new estimate at iteration @xmath128",
    "is then based on the results of all previous iterations .",
    "we refer to references @xcite for details .",
    "the flat histogram algorithm offers an efficient bootstrap to realize the multicanonical ensemble , while transition matrix monte carlo utilizes more data that can be collected in a simulation to improve statistics .",
    "we start from the detailed balance equation for some given dynamics : @xmath129 by summation over the states @xmath130 of fixed energy @xmath105 , and @xmath131 of fixed energy @xmath132 , and assuming that the probability of the state is a function of energy only , @xmath133 , we get @xmath134 where the transition matrix in the space of energy is defined as @xmath135 the matrix @xmath3 has a number of interesting properties : it is a stochastic matrix in the sense of @xmath136 and @xmath137 ; the stationary solution of @xmath3 is the energy distribution @xmath138 ; the dynamics associated with @xmath3 is considerably faster than that of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we specialize to the case of single - spin - flip dynamics for the ising model .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath33 for the spin states consists of a product of two factors , the probability of choosing a spin to flip @xmath139 , and the flip rate @xmath140 .",
    "we have @xmath141 less the two configurations @xmath130 and @xmath131 differ by one spin , in this case , the value of @xmath30 is @xmath142 , where @xmath46 is the number of spins in the system . using these results , we can rewrite the transition matrix as @xmath143 the diagonal elements are determined by normalization . substituting eq.([t - ssf ] ) into eq.([t - balance ] ) , using the relation between @xmath144 and @xmath123 , we obtain @xmath145 this is known as broad histogram equation @xcite which forms the basis for the flat histogram algorithm presented below . additionally , this equation also gives us a way of computing the density of states @xmath110 by the quantity @xmath146 obtained from spin configurations generated from any distribution @xmath147 .",
    "the quantity @xmath148 is the number of ways that the system goes to a state with energy @xmath149 , by a single spin flip from state @xmath130 .",
    "the angular brackets indicate a microcanonical average : @xmath150      the following algorithm @xcite generates flat histogram in energy and realizes the multicanonical ensemble .    1 .",
    "pick a site at random .",
    "2 .   flip the spin with probability @xmath151 where the current state @xmath130 has energy @xmath105 , the new state @xmath131 has energy @xmath152 .",
    "3 .   accumulate statistics for @xmath153 .",
    "4 .   go to 1 .",
    "we note by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ broad - histo - eq ] ) , the flip rate is the same as that in multicanonical simulation with a weight @xmath154 and metropolis acceptance rate .",
    "while in multicanonical sampling , the weight is obtained through several simulations iteratively , the quantities @xmath153 is much easier to obtain , through a single simulation .",
    "this quantity serves a dual purpose ",
    "it is used to construct a monte carlo algorithm ( used as input ) , and at the same time , it is used to compute the density of states ( output of the simulation ) .",
    "clearly , this is circular unless approximation is made .",
    "we have considered replacing the exact microcanonical average by an accumulative average , over the history of simulation generated so far , i.e. , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the sequence of states generated with the algorithm given above ; @xmath114 is the number of samples accumulated at the energy bin @xmath105 . in case the data for computing the flip rate",
    "is not available , we simply accept the move to explore the new state . a more rigorous way of doing simulation is to iterate the simulation with constant flip rate .",
    "for example , after the first simulation , we compute a first estimate to the density of states . in a second simulation , we perform multicanonical simulation  la lee @xcite . the data collected in the second run for @xmath157 will be unbiased .",
    "it is found that even with a single simulation , the results converge to the exact values ( for @xmath153 and @xmath110 ) for sufficiently long runs , even though a rigorous mathematical proof of the convergence is lacking .",
    "wang and landau @xcite proposed recently a new algorithm that works directly with the density of states @xmath110 .",
    "the simulation proceeds with the flip rate @xmath158 , but the value of the density of states is updated after every move by @xmath159 and letting @xmath160 for convergence .",
    "excellent results were obtained .",
    "a careful comparison with flat histogram method is needed .      in metropolis algorithm ,",
    "moves are sometimes rejected .",
    "this rejection is important for realizing the correct stationary distribution . in 1975",
    "bortz , kalos , and lebowitz @xcite proposed a rejection - free algorithm .",
    "it is still based on metropolis flip rate , but the waiting due to rejection is taking into account by considering all possible moves .",
    "the bortz - kalos - lebowitz n - fold way algorithm for the ising model goes as follows :    1 .",
    "compute the acceptance probability for one attempt of a move @xmath161 2 .",
    "pick an energy change @xmath162 according to probability @xmath163 flip a site belonging to @xmath162 with probability 1 .",
    "the site is choosing from the @xmath148 sites with equal probability .",
    "one n - fold - way move is equivalent to @xmath164 moves in the original dynamics .",
    "thus thermodynamic averages are weighted by @xmath164 , i.e. , @xmath165 , where summation is over every move @xmath166 .    in order to implement step 2 efficiently ,",
    "additional data structure is needed so that picking a spin in a given class characterized by @xmath162 is done in @xmath47 in computer time .",
    "combining n - fold way and flat histogram algorithm is easy , since the important quantity @xmath148 is already computed in flat histogram algorithm .",
    "the flip rate @xmath167 is given by formula ( [ flat - histo - rate ] ) . in the flat histogram algorithm , the probability that the energy of the system is @xmath105 is a constant , i.e. , @xmath168 the averages in the second line of the above equation refer to samples generated in an n - fold way simulation .",
    "in equal - hit algorithm ( ensemble ) @xcite , we require that the number of `` fresh configurations '' generated at each energy is a constant .",
    "more precisely equal - hit ensemble is _ defined _ by @xmath169 one possible choice of the flip rate is @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the inverse total acceptance rate @xmath164 arithmetic averaged over the n - fold way samples at energy @xmath105 .",
    "the histogram @xmath114 generated in the equal - hit algorithm depends on the precise dynamics ( the rate @xmath167 ) used .",
    "since there are many possible choices of the rate , such `` equal - hit ensemble '' is not unique .      while eq .",
    "( [ broad - histo - eq ] ) gives us a way of obtaining the density of states , there are more equations than unknowns .",
    "we consider two optimization methods .",
    "the first method is based on the transition matrix itself .",
    "we define @xmath172 .",

    "we assume that the energy level is equally spaced ( as in the ising model ) .",
    "consider three energy levels , @xmath105 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 . if we write down three equations of type ( [ broad - histo - eq ] ) , for transitions from @xmath105 to @xmath178 , @xmath178 to @xmath179 , and @xmath179 to @xmath105 , we can cancel the density of states by multiplying the three equations together .",
    "this leaves the last equation above , and it is known as ttt identity .",
    "it can be shown that multiple t identities ( four or more ) are not independent , and they need not put in as constraints . for ising model there is also one additional symmetry constraint , @xmath180 .",
