    "the fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos and muons with energies larger than 100 gev , which result from cosmic ray interactions with air molecules in the atmosphere@xcite , are measured in large underground detectors@xcite .",
    "the fluxes are interesting for a variety of reasons , including the fact that the leptons are the decay products of particles produced in collisions with center of mass energies that may be extremely high .",
    "cosmic rays , comprised primarily of protons , have been measured with energies up to @xmath0 ev@xcite , many orders of magnitude beyond the energies accessible in accelerator laboratories .",
    "in addition , atmospheric neutrinos and muons are a background for galactic and extra - galactic sources of neutrinos@xcite .",
    "atmospheric lepton fluxes come from two main sources .",
    "the so - called `` conventional '' atmospheric fluxes of muons and neutrinos come from hadronic production of @xmath1 s , @xmath2 and @xmath3 s in cosmic ray - air collisions , followed by their leptonic , and in the case of kaons , semileptonic , decays . at the energies considered here , @xmath4 gev ,",
    "the magnitudes of the conventional lepton fluxes are governed by the lifetimes of the mesons .",
    "because of time dilation , the decay lengths of these mesons are much larger than the depth of the atmosphere . a small fraction decay to leptons , but",
    "since they are copiously produced , the conventional flux dominates the lepton flux at the lower range of energies considered here . given an incident cosmic ray flux at the top of the atmosphere of @xmath5 , the flux of leptons from @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays has the energy dependence @xmath8 .",
    "values of @xmath9 are measured with @xmath10@xcite .",
    "charmed particle production and decay make important contributions to the lepton fluxes at high energies .",
    "essentially all of the charmed particles decay in the atmosphere since @xmath11 s , so these contributions are said to contribute to the `` prompt '' atmospheric flux .",
    "the energy behavior of the prompt fluxes is one power higher than the conventional fluxes for @xmath12 gev : @xmath13 .",
    "even though charm production is suppressed relative to pion and kaon production , the energy behavior of the prompt flux means that the flux of leptons from charm decay dominates at high energies . in the recent work of thunman , ingelman and gondolo@xcite , labeled here as tig , a monte carlo model of atmospheric lepton production based on pythia@xcite",
    "was used to calculate the contribution of charmed particle semileptonic decays to the atmospheric flux .    along with the semileptonic decays of charmed particles , in principle , secondary decays such as @xmath14 also contribute to the atmospheric lepton fluxes .",
    "essentially all charmed meson decays have at least one kaon or pion in the final state , and the charged kaons and pions decay mainly to muons and neutrinos .",
    "it is the fluxes of these secondary muons and neutrinos from charm decay , and the more general topic of the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions for the atmospheric lepton fluxes from charm decay , that are the topics of this paper .",
    "we show that using the perturbative cross section for charm production , the secondary lepton fluxes are significant for @xmath15 gev relative to the prompt fluxes , however they are small compared to the conventional fluxes .",
    "even for strongly enhanced charm production , as long as the cross section is consistent with experimental measurements , the secondary lepton flux is negligible compared to the conventional flux .    in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the standard calculational procedure , an approximate analytic method .",
    "details of this procedure are outlined in refs .",
    "we list our numerical inputs in section 3 and present our results in section 4 .",
    "we follow with a summary in section 5 .",
    "the calculations presented here are based on the cascade equations for baryon , meson and lepton fluxes@xcite .",
    "the cascade equations describe the production of particle @xmath16 through interactions and decays of particle @xmath17 , and the loss of particle @xmath16 through absorption and its own decay .",
    "the energy dependent flux of particles of type @xmath16 , @xmath18 , is governed in general by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the column depth ( slant depth ) in the atmosphere measured from the top of the atmosphere , @xmath21 is the hadronic interaction length and @xmath22 is the decay length , all converted to units of g/@xmath23 .",
    "the column depth is dependent on the incident angle .",
    "for vertical fluxes evaluated at sea level , the column depth is @xmath24 g/@xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 describes the source of particles of type @xmath16 from interactions or decays of particles of type @xmath17 . for neutrinos and muons at energies above 100 gev ,",
    "since the interaction and decay lengths are essentially infinite , only the source terms appear on the right hand side of equation ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the source terms have the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an interaction length or decay length , depending on the source .",
    "the quantity d@xmath28/d@xmath29 describes the energy distribution of the produced particle @xmath16 , and @xmath30 is the particle multiplicity . for decays ,",
    "the value of @xmath30 is unity , except for pions . for the production of charm ,",
    "@xmath31 .    in principle , the cascade equations are a coupled set of equations .",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions so that we can solve the equations analytically .",
    "first , we decouple the meson equations , with the exception of charm decay to pions and kaons . in principle",
    ", there are interaction terms such as @xmath32 , however , these are small compared to @xmath33 , so we neglect the former . with this assumption , we can solve for conventional @xmath7 and @xmath6 fluxes separately , then evaluate their contributions separately to the neutrino and muon fluxes .",
    "the same holds true for charm production .",
    "we follow the produced charm in their decays to leptons , pions and kaons .    to further simplify the calculation",
    ", we represent the cosmic ray flux by the proton flux .",
    "the cosmic ray composition is dominantly protons@xcite , so the treatment of cosmic rays as protons is reasonable .",
    "this approximation was used by tig in ref .",
    "@xcite . a feature that allows us",
    "to approximately solve the cascade equations is to use a factorization of the energy dependence in the fluxes . by writing @xmath34 and assuming that @xmath35 is weakly dependent on energy , approximate solutions to the cascade equations are straightforward and lead to the power law energy behavior described in the introduction .",
    "thunman , ingelman and gondolo have demonstrated this is a good approximation by comparing the approximate solutions to monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "this is especially useful because the source terms factorize to @xmath36 where @xmath37 depends only weakly on energy .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath38-moments is the essential ingredient in addition to @xmath39 to describe the lepton fluxes .",
    "the interaction moments include information about multiplicity , the magnitude and energy dependence of the relevant cross section and the energy distribution of the emerging particle . to simplify notation , we omit the energy argument in @xmath38 s , although we do include energy dependent @xmath38 s in our evaluation of the fluxes .    with the assumptions above , the solutions for the hadron fluxes are straightforward . for cosmic ray protons ,",
    "@xmath40 is infinite , and the solution for the flux is @xmath41 for @xmath42 . for hadrons other than the proton ,",
    "the solutions to the factorized cascade equations have two different forms , depending on whether one is in the high or low energy regime .",
    "the energy regime is determined by whether or not the decay length of the particle is large compared to the column depth .",
    "the cascade equations are solved approximately in these two regimes , then interpolation between high and low is done with @xmath43 explicit solutions appear , for example , in ref .",
    "the fluxes from each source are evaluated this way , then summed to get the total flux .",
    "the lepton fluxes come from hadron decays , where the hadron fluxes are approximated via eq . ( 2.6 ) . in the high and low energy regimes",
    ", the approximate lepton fluxes can be written in simple form .",
    "for definiteness , we write the flux for neutrinos .",
    "the flux for muons is in exactly the same form . at high energies ,",
    "the ( direct ) flux from source terms @xmath44leptons is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the density of air at column depth @xmath20 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath47 makes the flux of leptons from high energy hadron decays suppressed by one power of energy relative to the proton flux . for low energies , the hadron flux itself is proportional to @xmath47 and the decay length cancels .",
    "the energy dependence of the lepton flux tracks that of the primary cosmic ray proton flux . from the direct decays of low energy hadrons @xmath16 , @xmath48",
    "as indicated earlier , pions and kaons have relatively long lifetimes , so for @xmath4 gev , they are `` high energy '' hadrons resulting in a lepton flux proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "charmed hadrons , for most of the energy range @xmath50 gev , are low energy particles , so the resulting lepton flux has the low energy form proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "the extensions of these equations for secondary leptons from @xmath52charm@xmath53leptons is straightforward .",
    "the substitution @xmath54 is required for hadrons @xmath16 that come from charmed particle @xmath55 decays .",

    "tig have shown that for conventional charm production , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays dominate the sources of prompt leptons for most of the energies between @xmath60 gev .",
    "consequently , we consider charm contributions only via @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays .",

    "an accurate evaluation of @xmath70 is difficult because the hadronic decay distributions can not be calculated analytically .",

    "the data are not immediately translatable into decay @xmath38-moments because one must boost to the frame where the kinetic energies of the @xmath69 s are large .    for the simplest case of semileptonic charm decays , tig distribute lepton momenta according to a weak matrix element @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the final state hadron system .",
    "they find that the decay moments to muons and neutrinos are equal to within 15%  for @xmath69 mesons , and that the moments decrease by a factor of @xmath75 as the @xmath69 s make the transition from the low energy to high energy regime .    the matrix element in eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) does not account for form factor modifications of the hadron weak vertex .",

    "the lower dashed line has @xmath85 @xcite . 0.3 in    our procedure for the hadronic decay moments of the @xmath69 s is to use the same energy dependence and magnitude as the semileptonic @xmath69 moments as a function of energy , with a correction to account for the different branching fractions and particle multiplicities of the hadrons .",
    "for example , @xmath86    the @xmath87-moments and the branching fractions and multiplicities used are shown in table i. in the conversion to the appropriate z - moments , the particle data book values for the hadronic branching fractions@xcite were used .",
    "in addition , we use mark iii results on the topological branching fractions @xcite .",

    "part of the discrepancy comes from our ignoring @xmath93 and @xmath94 contributions .",
    "tig have shown that the @xmath94 , in particular , makes significant contributions at the higher energies .",
    "in addition , while we have attempted to use the same parameters as tig , not all of them are specified in their paper .",
    "finally , their fit was made to monte carlo results , which are not exactly reproduced by this semi - analytic method using @xmath38-moments . in any case , our focus is on secondary leptons in an energy regime where our results are in reasonable agreement with tig s parameterizations .",

    "the secondary muon neutrino flux exceeds the prompt neutrino flux only for @xmath95 gev .",
    "the flux of secondary muons ( and conventional muons ) is larger than the corresponding neutrino flux because muons in pion decay carry the bulk of the pion s energy . for fixed energy of the lepton ,",

    "a variation of the charm quark mass between 1.2 and 1.8 gev , and the renormalization scale between @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the nlo cross section gives a range of cross sections that vary by more than two orders of magnitude @xcite . by comparing the tig cross section with fixed target cross section results ,",

    "<S> we present a calculation of the fluxes of muons and muon neutrinos from the decays of pions and kaons that are themselves the decay products of charmed particles produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray - air collisions . using the perturbative cross section for charm production , </S>",
    "<S> these lepton fluxes are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the fluxes from the decays of pions and kaons directly produced in cosmic ray - air collisions . </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic charm models do not significantly alter our conclusions , nor do models with a charm cross section enhanced in the region above an incident cosmic ray energy of 1 tev . </S>"
