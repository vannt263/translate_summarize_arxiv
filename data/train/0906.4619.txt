    "the planetary mass function is a key constraint which theories of star and planet formation must be able to accurately predict , if they are to be considered viable .",
    "while a consensus is emerging that planet formation , in general , is probably dominated by the growth of rocky cores via the accretion of dust particles and/or ices ( i.e. the  core accretion  paradigm developed to explain the formation of the solar system , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the primary alternative scenario of direct gravitational collapse remains a plausible mechanism ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "three indirect lines of reasoning suggest that terrestrial - mass planets could orbit at least a few percent of stars .",
    "the first planet with a minimum mass of less than 10m@xmath6  ",
    "gj876d  was identified just 3 years ago .",
    "gj876d has a minimum ( @xmath7 ) mass of 4.9m@xmath6  and a probable mass of 7.5m@xmath6  @xcite . in the years since",
    ", a further five doppler exoplanets have been announced with minimum masses of less than 10m@xmath6@xcite . and",
    "a further two low - mass exoplanets have been revealed by gravitational microlensing searches @xcite .",
    "so there can be little doubt that exoplanets below 10m@xmath6  do indeed exist , though whether such planets are rocky ones ( like the earth ) or icy ones ( like neptune and uranus ) is yet to be unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "second , gas - giant planets exist around at least 6.5% of nearby main sequence stars @xcite and planet formation theories suggest that rocky cores and embryos should accompany such jovian planets @xcite .",
    "finally , dusty protoplanetary disks are very common around young t tauri stars , which suggests the ubiquity of the building blocks of rocky planets @xcite .    while not definitive , these observations are suggestive of the existence of rocky planets outside our solar system .",
    "however , the theory of rocky planet formation remains less than solid .",
    "we do not know what fraction of stars form rocky planets , nor how many of those planets avoid dynamical ejection by the larger planets .",
    "worse , we do not know if rocky planets with masses above 1m@xmath6  quickly accrete gas and volatiles to become ice - giants like neptune and uranus .",
    "this has been predicted by @xcite and @xcite , and would result in a planetary mass desert between 1 and 14m@xmath6 , as indeed we see in our solar system .",
    "theory does suggest that disks with higher surface - mass density than the minimum - mass solar nebula are expected to produce numerous rocky planets formed closer to their parent star , which would make their doppler detection more feasible @xcite .",
    "moreover , planets of 1 - 15m@xmath6  may retain water in amounts that are comparable to the silicates and iron - peak elements , resulting in a family of ocean - planets @xcite .",
    "what is clear , is that the detection of a statistically meaningful sample of planets between 5 - 25m@xmath6 , along with measurements of their masses , radii , and orbits , will be required to significantly inform these diverse theories , and drive forward our detailed understanding of how planets form .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) is a long - term radial velocity program targeting the detection and parametrisation of exoplanets .",
    "the aaps main survey targets 250 southern sun - like stars , and has been in operation since 1998 .",
    "to date the survey has discovered 32 new exoplanets orbiting stars in the main sample @xcite .",
    "aaps precision doppler measurements are made with the ucles echelle spectrometer @xcite .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph point - spread function and wavelength calibration are derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "this observing and analysis system has demonstrated long term precisions of 3  for late - f , g , and early - k dwarfs brighter than v=7.5 @xcite .",
    "the ucles dispersion through a 1  slit gives an effective resolution of @xmath8=60000 .",
    "a precision of 1corresponds to displacements of 0.5millipixel at our detector , and this , then , is the level below which we aim to hold the sum of all systematic uncertainties .",
    "many subtle uncertainty issues enter at the level of 0.5 millipixel , such as determining the wavelength scale to 9 significant digits , establishing the psf shape at 1 part in 1000 ( which varies dramatically with wavelength and seeing ) , measuring the charge transfer efficiency of the ccd , and calibrating the non - linear response of the quantum efficiency of the ccd .",
    "in addition , we specifically treat the earth s telluric h@xmath9o and o@xmath9 lines that contaminate our spectra at levels below 0.5% intensity , and we eliminate all ghosts and defects from the spectrometer and ccd , on a pixel by pixel basis . we also employ a fully relativistic doppler correction to the barycenter of the solar system to remove the effect of the earth s orbital motion and rotational spin .",
    "our data processing procedures follow those described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all data taken by the aaps to date have been reprocessed through our continuously upgraded analysis system .",
    "the results presented in this paper arise from the current version of that pipeline .",
    "the detection of very low - mass exoplanets by the aaps and other doppler programs within the last 4 - 5 years has in large part been due to the dramatic improvements achieved in the measurement precisions these searches achieve .",
    "these have improved to such an extent that it is now clear that noise sources _ intrinsic _ to the parent star themselves are the limiting factor for very low - mass exoplanet detection .",
    "characterisation of these noise sources ( jitter , convective granulation and asteroseismological p - mode oscillations ) has become an important focus of doppler planet detection . a few obvious modifications to current observing strategies have emerged  ( 1 ) target low - mass stars ; ( 2 ) target chromospherically inactive and slowly rotating stars ; ( 3 ) target high - gravity stars ( where p - mode oscillations are minimised ) and ( 4 ) extend the observations of stars over several p - mode fundamental periods , so that asteroseismological noise is averaged over .",
    "the anglo - australian rocky planet search specifically seeks to focus on the last three of these observing strategies , in an effort to push to the lowest possible detection limits achievable with our system .",
    "that is , it focusses on the observation of bright stars known to be relatively stable to radial velocity jitter ( e.g. wright 2005 ) .",
    "we ensure that all observations of each target are of sufficient length to average over the dominant asteroseismological period for each target star . for this purpose , we employed the algorithms of @xcite to derive the maximum asteroseismological beat period ( @xmath10 ) for each star , and then ensure that observations are _ at least _ this long .",
    "observations of our rocky planet search targets , which typically spanned 15 - 20 minutes , easily achieved this goal .",
    "finally , and most importantly , observations are carried out over long , contiguous observing runs of 48 nights .",
    "these long observing blocks are critical , as they allow us to integrate up fourier power and suppress sidebands in the window function over many periods .",
    "the first of these rocky planet search observing blocks was scheduled on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) from 2007 jan 10 to 2007 feb 26 , spanning two full bright lunations and the dark and grey time in between .",
    "the power of this intensive observing approach is most simply and dramatically demonstrated by our detection of the short - period planet hd16417b @xcite from 24 epochs obtained on that run , and the _ non - detection _ of the same planet in a similar quantity of similar quality data spread over a 2 year period .",
    "this bears out the simulations performed by other investigators  that to detect planets with amplitudes of 1-to-3 times that of the net measurement uncertainty , it is necessary to acquire observations over many contiguous periods ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the stars chosen for rocky planet search observation on this first run were a subset of the aaps main sample @xcite that are bright ( v@xmath116.7 ) , inactive ( @xmath12r@xmath13@xmath14 ) and in the right ascension range 0 - 17@xmath15 with southerly declinations , suitable for observation in january and february at the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the sample all had primary asteroseismological period , @xmath10 , less than 800s .",
    "it includes 24 f , g and k stars .",
    "no metallicity criteria were used in this selection .",
    "stars with known stellar companions within 2 arcsec are removed from the observing list as it is operationally difficult to get an uncontaminated spectrum of a star with a nearby companion .",
    "one star which satisfied these criteria ( hd75289 ) has a known exoplanet in a 3.5d orbit @xcite of such high - amplitude ( k=54 ) that it would have significantly complicated the possibility of detecting a low - mass planet . as a result",
    "it was not included in the observed sample .",
    "otherwise , stars were not rejected on the basis of having known exoplanets .",
    "hd4308 was selected for inclusion in this sample when the observing program was first proposed in 2005 , and was retained for observation even after a low - amplitude planet ( k=4 ) was announced in a 15.1d orbit by @xcite .",
    "the stars observed , and their properties , are summarised in table [ tab : targets ] . all of these stars have been included in large - scale studies of nearby solar type stars .",
    "@xcite included them in a magnitude - limited , kinematically unbiased study of 16682 nearby f and g dwarf stars .",
    "@xcite included them in a study of the stellar properties for 1040 f , g and k stars observed for the anglo - australian , lick and keck planet search programmes .",
    "valenti & fischer used high signal - to - noise ratio echelle spectra ( originally taken as radial velocity template spectra ) and spectral synthesis to derive effective temperatures , surface gravities and metallicities whereas @xcite used strmgren photometry and the infrared flux calibration of @xcite .",
    "both studies use hipparcos parallaxes to obtain luminosities and make comparisons with different theoretical isochrones to derive stellar parameters . to determine stellar masses and ages valenti & fischer use yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite , while @xcite use padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "both sets of derived parameters are consistent to within the uncertainties of these studies .",
    "the observing strategy on each night was straightforward  to observe every star in the target list for at least 15 minutes ( or as long as is required to obtain s / n@xmath16400 per spectral pixel given the available transparency and seeing conditions ) on each of the 48 nights of observing .",
    "the number of observations actually obtained for each of the 24 targets is given in table [ tab : obs ] and ranges from 18 to 44 , with a median of 31 .",
    "the second column in this table provides the root - mean - square ( rms ) for each target about the mean velocity , with four exceptions  the values given for the two stars with planets ( hd16417 and hd4308  see below ) are the rms of the residuals after a best - fit planet was subtracted , and the values for the two components of the binary system @xmath17 cen ( hd128620 and hd128621 ) have had linear trends subtracted .",

    "the periodogram of hd84117 shows essentially no power at periods of less than 40d , though a complex , broad power distribution is seen at longer periods , i.e. longer than the time - span of the observations .",
    "we can therefore fit the data with no compelling single keplerian .",
    "hd84117 may either contain multiple planets , which will require intensive observation to disentangle , or may be a star with an unusual class of velocity variability .",

    "thirteen of the 24 stars have observed rms values consistent with their jitter estimates to within @xmath1850% and all but two are consistent to within a factor of two  this is in line with expectations if the jitter estimates have a 1-@xmath20 uncertainty of @xmath1850% .",
    "the two outliers in this comparison are hd1581 ( f9.5v ) and hd23429 ( k0v ) , where the observed velocity variation is much less than that predicted by the jitter model ( by factors of 2.3 and 2.5 , respectively ) , and hd115617 ( g5v ) where the level of variability observed is larger than that predicted by the jitter model ( by a factor of 2.2 ) .",
    "the activity jitter estimate does not include velocity variability due to asteroseismological oscillations ( which is in general much smaller than the activity jitter ",
    "see table [ tab : obs ] ) and more importantly , does not include the effects of convective granulation , which is ( to date ) unparametrised for any doppler planet search stars .",
    "what can be concluded is that at very high velocity precisions , even `` inactive '' stars remain velocity variable at low levels .",
    "there are two objects in our target list that have detectable planets orbiting them : hd4308 and hd16417 .",
    "the latter was discovered as part of this observing campaign with p=17.24@xmath180.01d , @xmath21=0.20@xmath180.09 , and @xmath7=22.1@xmath182.0m@xmath6 .",

    "this includes both the observations obtained of hd4308 in the rocky planet search run of 2007 jan - feb , and other aaps observations obtained with similar snr between 2005 oct 21 and 2007 nov 27 .",

    "the result is suggestive of power at period between 30 - 80d .",

    "we then use detailed object - by - object monte - carlo simulations @xcite , to explore the biases introduced by these noise sources , when combined with our observational window functions .",
    "the procedure we employ is to generate single keplerians for a grid of periods , eccentricities and semi - amplitudes , which are then sampled at the actual observation time - stamps and which have noise added to them in line with the actual measurement uncertainties and stellar noise appropriate for each epoch .",
    "these simulated observations are then subjected to an automated detection process , enabling us to determine the range of period , planet mass and orbital eccentricity to which each data set is sensitive .",
    "the simulations are performed using the keter and swinburne supercomputer facilities .",
    "details of the simulations and detectability criteria are described in @xcite  though with the modification to the procedure in that paper ( which describes the analysis of purely artificial data ) , that the simulations of _ actual _ data , used here , include added noise terms due to intrinsic stellar velocity variability @xcite .    to simulate the 48 nights of data obtained on this first rocky planet search run",
    ", we used a subset of the model grid from @xcite with input periods on a logarithmic scale from @xmath24 ( i.e. periods of between 2d and 16d ) ; input eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.1 & 0.2 ; and planet masses of 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.5m@xmath25 .",
    "the eccentricity range simulated was deliberatelylimited to the `` near - circular '' range of @xmath21=0.0 - 0.2 , since ( a ) the majority of planets in such small orbits ( i.e. @xmath110.12au ) will have undergone significant tidal circularisation , and ( b ) the vast majority of detected doppler exoplanets with periods of less than 16d have eccentricities , @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as our data is approximately evenly sampled ( each star was observed on average once per night at approximately the same time ) , we have supplemented the above with additional simulations at the same eccentricities and masses , but with non - integer periods of 2.8 , 4.3 , 5.6 , 8.7 , 11.2 , 17.4 and 22.4 days . because the keplerian function of a doppler exoplanet is unable to determine inclination angle to the line of sight , @xmath27 , no attempt has been made to deal with this in these simulations . as a result ,",
    "whenever we refer to `` mass '' for a simulated planet in the following discussion , we are actually probing the @xmath7  `` minimum mass '' of that planet .",
    "for each ( period , eccentricity , planet mass ) point in this grid , 100 realisations are performed each with random noise added appropriate to the combined impact of the uncertainty at that time - stamp and the jitter and p - mode noise appropriate for that star ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "each star , then , is the subject of 21600 simulations .",

    ", we define `` detectability '' at a given set of orbital parameters as the number of detections ( using the detection criteria of * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : detect ] for two examples ( hd4308 and hd53705 ) , as well as for the whole sample of 24 objects .",
    "the specific examples shown for hd4308 and hd53705 display the general features seen in the simulations of all the targets : first that detectability is very high at periods longer than a few days and at masses above 20m@xmath6 ; and second , that the details of the detectability contours vary from object to object . the primary cause for this is the different time and snr sampling of the observations of each star .",
    "this reinforces the importance of simulating radial - velocity data on a star - by - star basis , rather than on a survey sensitivity basis .",
    "we not that the structure in the surfaces at @xmath192 and @xmath194 days is an effect of sampling ; the observations were taken on average once per night at approximately the same time .",
    "this means that planets with periods that are integer multiples of this have poorly constrained parameters and are therefore harder to detect .    and",
    "finally , we must ask how many planets are detected from our actual observations if we apply to them the same automated criteria used to detect planets from the simulated data sets ?",
    "reassuringly , we find that just two planets are detected ( hd4308b and hd16417b , although the former is perhaps marginal )  none of the other stars reveal planets that pass our automated detection criteria .",
    "we can see from the average detectability surface in fig . [",
    "fig : detect ] that the sensitivity of our survey of these 24 stars extends down to detectabilities of 10% or more at masses of 5m@xmath6  over periods of 2 - 10d . for higher mass planets , the survey is more sensitive , with the detectability being 40% or better for all planets with minimum mass @xmath28m@xmath6  and period @xmath29d .    with two planets known with minimum masses of 13.0 and 22.1m@xmath6from a survey of 24 stars ,",
    "the first - order conclusion that can be drawn from this data set is that for periods of 2 - 16d the frequency of low - mass ( i.e. @xmath7=10 - 25m@xmath6 ) planets is @xmath30% .",
    "however , this neglects both the fact that we know that our detectability is less than perfect ( though non - zero ) over this mass range , and the fact that we know that our planet detectability is a strong function of planet mass and a weak function of planet period . these effects need to be accounted for if we are to draw more robust conclusions from this survey .    for different exoplanet mass functions",
    ", we would expect our survey to have sensitivity to different masses .",
    "put simply , a very steep exoplanet mass function should counteract our detectability surfaces to enable the detection of planets in the very lowest masses .",
    "conversely , a flatter mass function should bias our results toward the detection of higher - mass planets .",
    "so we should be able to use our data and simulations to provide much more insight into the frequency of low - mass planets .",
    "if we parameterise the planet mass function as a power - law d@xmath31/d@xmath32 ( we assume for simplicity that there is no change in the incidence of planets over this period range at these masses ) , we can ask , given our known detectability surface as a function of mass and period , what normalisation of that power - law would give us two exoplanet detections from our survey ?",
    "given our assumption that planet frequency is independent of period in this period range , and because detectability is also a weak function of period in this range , we make the further simplifying assumption that we can integrate over the detectability surface at a given mass to derive an average detectability as a function of mass alone @xmath33 .",
    "we can then write the number of planets detected from our survey , @xmath34 , as a function of the number of stars observed @xmath35 , the average frequency of planets in a given mass and period range , @xmath36 , the detectability as a function of mass , @xmath33 , and the power - law mass function ,      from which ( given @xmath38 ) we can derive @xmath36 ( averaged over the period range p=2 - 22d and the mass range 0.01 - 20m@xmath25 ) , which varies from 0.14@xmath180.10 at @xmath17=@xmath39 , up to 0.70@xmath180.85 at @xmath17=@xmath40 , in the f , g and k stars probed here . these planet frequencies might seem high in comparison to other work , though this is almost certainly due to the much lower masses being considered . for example , in figure 12 of @xcite , those authors find an exoplanet frequency of 3% for periods less than 16 days and masses above 30m@xmath6 .",
    "the data presented here , in comparison , include significant sensitivity down to 4m@xmath6 .",
    "the normalisations found here are , of course , uncertain due to the poisson - counting statistics of just 2 detections ( in a sample of 24 stars ) , and do only probe a relatively small range of periods ( or equivalently , semi - major axes ) . having said which , this survey is important in being one of the first doppler surveys of low - mass exoplanets with robustly characterised selection effects .",

    "given that we have found two exoplanet signals in the 16 - 25m@xmath6minimum mass range ( corresponding to the 0.05m@xmath25  or 16m@xmath6bin in fig .",

    "they can readily be improved with ( 1 ) an expanded sample of high precision data on a larger sample , ( 2 ) simulations covering larger sets of high - precision aaps matching the quality obtained in this intensive observing run , ( 3 ) higher resolution simulations ( i.e. more realisations at more closely sampled orbital parameters ) and ( 4 ) further improvements in our understanding of stellar jitter and convective granulation .",
