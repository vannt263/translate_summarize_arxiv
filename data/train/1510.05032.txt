    "the strong magnetic field ( @xmath9 g ) of the neutron star enforces collimated accretion along the field lines and quantizes the electron energy states perpendicular to those field lines .",

    "this is known as a cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) , which , as can be seen in equation  ( [ ecycl ] ) , can be used to determine the magnetic field strength of highly magnetized pulsars .",
    "the first spectral analysis of xtej1946@xmath0274 was performed by @xcite using pointed _ rxte _ data from the first observed outburst in 1998 .",

    "as explained in  [ subsec : crsf ] , their higher value could be due to in part modeling an artificial feature , as these authors include pin data above 40kev , where the source is mostly not detected .",
    "our spectrum is not consistent with the 25kev feature discussed by @xcite .",
    "we tried including a feature with their parameters and the @xmath243 increased to 1.92 .",
    "when the depth of this 25kev feature was left free it became consistent with zero .",
    "it has recently been recognized that different types of correlations between the energy of the crsf @xmath175 and the x - ray luminosity @xmath244 are observed for accreting pulsars , probably reflecting different accretion states @xcite .",
    "studying these correlations allows us to derive constraints on the physical conditions in the accretion column .",
    "@xcite presented a model of the different accretion regimes and of how the height ( i.e. , the @xmath14-field and therefore @xmath175 ) of the region in the accretion column where the crsf is produced changes with luminosity for the different regimes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : for supercritical sources ( @xmath245 ) radiation pressure in a radiative shock in the accretion column is the dominant decelerator for the material inside the accretion column .",
    "a source in this regime is expected to show a negative @xmath175-@xmath244 correlation , as observed for @xcite . for moderately subcritical sources ( @xmath246 )",
    "the radiation - dominated shock causes the initial deceleration , followed by coulomb interactions below the shock which bring the matter to a stop on the neutron star surface .",
    "subcritical sources in this regime are expected to show a positive @xmath175-@xmath244 correlation , as observed for or @xcite .",
    "the expected relationship at even lower luminosities ( @xmath247 ) , where the radiative shock and coulomb interactions disappear , and the matter falls through a gas - mediated shock before hitting the stellar surface , is less clear .",

    "* but see @xcite and @xcite ) .    where does xtej1946 + 274 fit into this picture ? in figure  [ fig : crsf_lum ] we show the coulomb luminosity @xmath248 and the critical luminosity @xmath249 for a range of @xmath14-fields , i.e. , cyclotron line energies ( after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , separating the different accretion regimes .",
    "these luminosities depend among other things on the accretion geometry outside of the afvn sphere , two cases are presented : disk and wind accretion .",
    "overplotted are the gravitational redshift corrected cyclotron line energies and 360kev luminosities from @xcite and from our _ suzaku _ analysis .",
    "we calculated the _",
    "suzaku _ luminosity using the unabsorbed flux measurement from the fdcut iii spectral fit .",
    "the crsf energy is consistent within errors between 1998 and 2010 , implying that the height of the crsf emission region is similar for both observations .",
    "the luminosities , while both moderate , span a range larger than observed for any other moderate luminosity pulsar ( e.g. , her  x-1 or gx  304@xmath2501 ) fall in the transition region between low and high luminosity pulsars . in the case of disk accretion ,",
    "the default assumption for be - systems , both luminosities are consistent with subcritical accretion , with the 1998 _ rxte _ measurement at @xmath246 and the _ suzaku _ measurement at @xmath247 . taking the uncertainties of the distance measurement into account , the similarity of the cyclotron line energy measurements is not inconsistent with the @xcite picture . in the case of wind accretion xtej1946 + 274",
    "would have been supercritical during both measurements and a negative @xmath175-@xmath244 correlation would be expected . calculating the difference in emission heights for supercritical accretion following equation  ( 40 ) of @xcite and assuming a dipole magnetic field , @xmath251kev is expected for the two luminosities .",
    "this is comparable to the uncertainties of the two @xmath175 measurements , i.e. , though unlikely , we can not rule out the presence of such a change .",
    "we note that wind accretion has so far only been discussed as a possibility for explaining the @xmath175-@xmath244 relationship of persistent , non - be , low luminosity sources like vela x-1 and 4u1538@xmath250522 @xcite .",
    "we did not include the data from @xcite because the presence of a crsf at 25kev at fluxes between the 1998 and 2010 extremes is only marginally supported ( see  [ subsec : crsf ] ) .",
    "however , a higher emission region at intermediate fluxes in the coulomb braking regime ( disk accretion ) is again consistent with the @xcite picture while it is not consistent in the supercritical regime ( wind accretion ) . using",
    "the more precise treatment of the critical luminosity by @xcite is qualitatively in agreement with this picture .",
    "we can calculate the crsf emission region height for a subcritical source at which the coulomb interactions start decelerating the plasma using equation  ( 51 ) of @xcite : @xmath252 where the following parameters are as defined in @xcite : @xmath253 describes the disk accretion case , @xmath254 is the thomson optical depth in the coulomb regime , @xmath255 and @xmath256 km are typical values for the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "we obtained @xmath257 m for the emission height using @xmath258 g with @xmath259 and @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the observed pulse profiles at low and high fluxes supports a scenario where no strong changes in the emission geometry happen over and between outbursts .",
    "the 2010 _ rxte _ and _ suzaku _ pulse profiles of xtej1946 + 274 are double - peaked with a deep and a shallow minimum that show weak energy dependence of the depths ( figure  [ fig : pulse_profile ] ) .",
    "this structure is strongly similar to what has been observed by @xcite and @xcite during the 1998 outburst with other instruments at different luminosities .",
    "the source even shows a double - peaked profile during quiescence as observed by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "interestingly the @xmath82040kev pulse profile of a0535 + 26 is very similar to that of xtej1946 + 274 @xcite . modeling the profiles of the 2005 august / september outburst of a0535 + 26 , @xcite determined a possible emission pattern by taking into account the contribution of each of the two magnetic poles .",
    "they assumed a dipole magnetic field with axisymmetric emission regions .",
    "the asymmetry of the pulse profile minima is explained by a small offset of one of the emission regions from being antipodal .",
    "the profiles for a0535 + 26 were obtained when the source had a luminosity of @xmath261ergs@xmath4 @xcite , i.e. , not unlike the lower range observed for xtej1946 + 274 .    in summary , for xtej1946 + 274 the stability of the pulse profile shape , the lack of strong changes of the spectral shape (  [ discussion : continuum ] ) , and the possibly constant crsf energy with luminosity",
    "all indicate that there have been no major changes in the accretion column structure and emission geometry over the broad range of moderate luminosities covered by observations .",
    "in this paper we analyzed a 50ks _ suzaku _ observation of the accreting pulsar xtej1946 + 274 taken at the end of the second outburst in an outburst series in 2010 .",
    "we performed a detailed temporal and spectral analysis and compared our results to data available from other instruments and outbursts . in the following",
    "we summarize the results of our analysis :    1 .",
    "we determined a new orbital solution based on _ fermi_-gbm and other data .",
    "its parameters and possible intrinsic pulse period evolutions are listed in table  [ tab : periodfit ] and shown in figure  [ fig : gbm_profile ] .",
    "we observed no strong changes between the _ suzaku _ spectrum and previously analyzed spectra for different luminosities and outbursts .",
    "the _ suzaku _ observation allowed us to extend the correlation between the continuum x - ray flux and the flux of the narrow fek@xmath1 line to lower fluxes than observed before . comparing the observed correlation with the theoretically expected values for fluorescence emission shows a possible slight elevation of the line flux .",
    "this could indicate either an overabundance of iron , a more complex ionization structure , or a more complex spatial structure of the emitting medium than assumed by the simplest model .",
    "the _ suzaku _ spectrum shows a feature that can be modeled with a cyclotron line component at @xmath145kev at a significance of @xmath200 .",
    "the unchanging cyclotron line energy and similar pulse profile shape with luminosity between 1998 and 2010 suggest that the source does not experience strong changes in emission geometry and that xtej1946 + 274 has been consistently accreting in the subcritical regime .",
    ".   there are similarities between xtej1946 + 274 and a0535 + 26 regarding their pulse profile structure and a possibly unchanging cyclotron energy with luminosity .",
    "a more detailed study of these similarities could prove useful for better understanding accreting x - ray pulsars in be systems .",
    "xtej1946 + 274 is rarely in outburst , with its two known episodes of activity having occurred approximately a decade apart .",
    "it remains a source with many unanswered questions .",
    "in particular , monitoring of possible future outbursts with sensitive instruments such as the ones on _ nustar _ or _ astro - h _ could fill the gap in the cyclotron line energy versus x - ray luminosity correlation and shed new light on the accretion mechanism of this source .",
