    "the art of demonstrating the wave nature of material particles experienced considerable advances in recent years ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the interfering species evolved from the elementary particles of the early experiments @xcite to composite objects with an internal structure . in particular , the experiments in atom interferometry have left the stage of proof - of - principle demonstrations , and provide substantial applications in metrology @xcite .",
    "objects with even larger complexity , such as molecules or clusters , exhibit a rich internal structure that can interact in various ways with external fields .",
    "their interference is highly sensitive to the corresponding phase shifts , thus offering the potential to measure molecular properties with unprecedented precision . at the same time",
    "any coupling to uncontrollable fields and environmental degrees of freedom severely limits the ability of large objects to show interference .",
    "these effects are bound to become dominant as the chosen objects increase in size and complexity .",
    "the influence of environmental coupling on a quantum system may be described by decoherence theory @xcite .",
    "it considers both the influence of noise due to uncontrollable external fields and the effect of the entanglement with unobserved dynamic degrees of freedom .",
    "this latter phenomenon  the dynamic delocalization of quantum coherence into many environmental degrees of freedom  largely explains the emergence of classical behavior in a quantum description .",
    "in particular , it describes the wave - particle complementarity encountered if one seeks to determine by a ( macroscopic ) measurement device the path taken .",
    "since matter wave interferometers establish quantum coherence on a macroscopic scale they are sensitive tools to probe the quantum - to - classical transition of complex objects .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide the theoretical framework needed to describe the diffraction and decoherence effects encountered in the interferometry of large , massive objects .",
    "we focus on near - field talbot - lau interference , which is the favored setup for short de broglie wavelengths .",
    "we take care to describe the effects of diffraction and decoherence with realistic parameters , to permit a direct quantitative comparison with the experimental signal .",
    "the interactions are treated on a microscopic level using the bulk properties of materials and particles .",
    "we note that the recent interference experiments with fullerenes and biomolecules @xcite were analyzed using the theory presented in this article .    before going into calculations we start with an informal discussion of talbot - lau interference @xcite . in this setup",
    "an essentially uncollimated particle beam passes three parallel gratings .",
    "effectively , the first grating acts as an array of collimation slits which illuminate the second grating .",
    "diffraction at the second grating then leads , for particular choices of the grating periods and the wavelength , to a high contrast near - field interference pattern at the position of the third grating .",
    "this density pattern is observed with the help of the third grating by recording the transmitted flux as a function of the lateral grating position .",
    "an important advantage of the talbot - lau effect is the favorable scaling behavior with respect to larger masses of the interfering object @xcite . unlike in far - field diffraction , where the required grating period falls linearly with the de  broglie wavelength , it decreases merely like the square root in the talbot - lau setup .",
    "in addition , the collimation requirements are much weaker than for far field diffraction , and the spatially resolving detector is already built into the device .",
    "however , for a fixed particle velocity it is not immediately evident whether the observed signal proves genuine quantum interference , since a certain fringe pattern could also be expected from a classical moir effect .",
    "this classical pattern can be suppressed by an appropriate choice of the open fraction of the grating and , unlike the strong wave - length dependence found in the interference effect , the ideal classical shadow fringes do not depend on the velocity . nonetheless , in order to distinguish clearly the quantum phenomenon from a classical expectation it is necessary to describe the quantum and the classical evolution in the same theoretical framework , thus ensuring that all interactions and approximations are treated equally .",
    "a first aim of this article is to provide such a description that draws the demarcation line between the predictions of quantum and classical mechanics concisely and quantitatively .",
    "the second aim is then to account for the relevant environmental interactions , thus providing a quantitative description of the transition from the quantum to the classical behavior . for both goals",
    "it will be helpful to describe the state in the interferometer in terms of a stationary , unnormalized wigner function .",
    "due to the stationary formulation the effect of decoherence will not be given by a master equation .",
    "therfore , it is shown in the final part of the paper that our treatment is equivalent to the conventional dynamic formulation of decoherence in terms of a normalized wigner function .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : wigner ] we review the coherent talbot - lau effect and give a formulation in terms of the wigner function .",
    "the corresponding classical shadow effect is calculated on an equal footing in the phase space representation .",
    "the influence of the interaction with realistic gratings , which is very important for a quantitative description , is accounted for in sect .",
    "[ sec : gratings ] .",
    "those effects are also treated on an equal degree of approximation in the quantum and the classical description . in sect .",
    "[ sec : deco ] we include the possibility of decoherence and show how it can be accounted for analytically .",
    "the specific predictions for decoherence due to collisions and due to heat radiation are then obtained in sect .",
    "[ sec : decofunction ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mastereq ] we relate the description of decoherence in terms of a stationary beam to the solution of the corresponding time - dependent master equation . concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "since the coherent theory of the talbot - lau effect can be found in the literature @xcite we shall present no detailed derivations , but discuss the approximations involved and state the results in terms of the wigner function as far as needed for the later inclusion of decoherence effects .",
    "consider the usual interferometric situation where a flux of particles enters at @xmath0 with a longitudinal momentum @xmath1 that is much greater than its transverse components .",
    "ideally , the particle is in a momentum eigenstate , or in an incoherent mixture thereof , before passing a number of collimation slits and gratings .",
    "the vector @xmath2 describes the distance of the particles from the interferometer axis . in the usual paraxial approximation",
    "this separation , as well as the structures in the grating and in the collimation planes , are assumed to be small compared to the distances @xmath3 between the optical elements , @xmath4 . in this case one",
    "may evaluate the transmission to leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "this approximation implies that the longitudinal and the transverse part of the state remain separable throughout the interferometer .",
    "it follows that the discussion may be confined to the transverse degrees of freedom as described by @xmath6 if the evolution is completely coherent  or , in the general case , by the density matrix @xmath7 .",
    "given the wave function @xmath8 on the @xmath0 plane the free unitary evolution up to the plane @xmath9 yields , to leading order , the transverse state ,    @xmath10    as follows from an asymptotic expansion of the free green function , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this paraxial approximation is the fact that it reflects the composition property of the exact propagation without any loss of accuracy . that is , propagating the wave function first by a distance @xmath11 and subsequently by the distance @xmath12 yields exactly the same result as a single propagation by @xmath13 , @xmath14    which follows from gaussian integration .",
    "hence , within the paraxial approximation no loss of accuracy is introduced by dividing the propagation into a sequence of intervals and integrating over the interjacent planes .",
    "this freedom will be used below as a crucial ingredient when we describe the effects of decoherence .",
    "note that the composition property ( [ psi3 ] ) does not require a large separation between the planes . even for infinitesimally close planes one obtains the correct expression ( [ eq : parapr ] ) .",
    "this can be seen immediately in ( [ psi3 ] ) by noting a particular representation of the two - dimensional @xmath15 function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( a.33 ) ) , @xmath16    the first equality in ( [ psi3 ] ) also shows how the existence of an ideal grating at @xmath17 would affect the propagated state . in the case of a binary grating",
    "the @xmath18-integration would be simply restricted to the transparent parts of the grating plane .",
    "in general , an ideal grating causes an amplitude and phase modulation @xmath19 which is accounted for by the additional appearance of a grating function @xmath20 under the integral .",
    "the passage of a particle stream through a general interferometer may now be described as a sequence of transmissions through gratings or collimation slits as described by ( [ eq : gratingtrafo1 ] ) each followed by a free evolution ( [ eq : parapr ] ) .",
    "this holds also for general , mixed states since any density operator can be represented as a convex sum of projectors to pure states .      we proceed to formulate the propagation in the wigner representation , which has several advantages .",
    "first , the wigner function permits a direct comparison of the quantum evolution to the classical dynamics in terms of phase space distributions .",
    "second , and more importantly , it is the most convenient starting point to include effects of decoherence in sect .",
    "[ sec : deco ] . finally , the free evolution ( [ eq : parapr ] ) has a particularly simple form in the wigner representation .",
    "the wigner function is the fourier transformation of the position density matrix @xmath7 with respect to the two - point separation @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 it may be viewed as a quantum analogue to the classical phase space distribution @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the transverse momentum vector .    in order to obtain the free unitary evolution of the wigner function we note that the density matrix in position representation has the general form @xmath25 with @xmath26 . according to ( [ eq : parapr ] ) a free unitary evolution by the distance @xmath27 yields @xmath28 from ( [ eq : wignerdef ] ) and ( [ eq : rhotrafo ] ) it follows that a free unitary evolution by the distance @xmath27 changes the wigner function according to @xmath29 this transformation is particularly simple and , as one expects , is identical to the free movement of a classical probability density in the phase space of the transverse degree of freedom .",
    "the decisive difference between the classical and the quantum phase space dynamics is found in the transformation for passing through a grating .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gratingtrafo1 ] ) implies that by going through a grating the wigner function undergoes a convolution @xmath30 which in general builds up quantum coherences that show up as oscillations in the momentum direction .",
    "here we define the convolution kernel analogously to ( [ eq : wignerdef ] ) as @xmath31 note that by stating ( [ eq : gratingtrafo2x ] ) we do not keep the normalization of the wigner function .",
    "indeed , a finite fraction of the particles may hit the grating and may be removed from the flux .",
    "therefore it is convenient to work with an unnormalized state and take care of the normalization only in the end .    with the transformations ( [ eq : freetrafo1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gratingtrafo2x ] ) we can proceed to describe the talbot - lau effect in a general framework .      in the talbot - lau setup a monochromatic beam passes three vertical gratings that are separated by the distances @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since the particle stream is effectively uncollimated in front of the first grating its wigner function for the transverse degrees of freedom",
    "is uniform .",
    "if we start with the ( improper ) normalization @xmath32 then ( [ eq : tdef ] ) yields the wigner function after the first grating @xmath33 the free unitary evolution by a distance @xmath11 , followed by a passage through a grating ( with convolution kernel @xmath34 ) and another free evolution by a distance @xmath35 leads to the general expression @xmath36 the particle density at position @xmath37 is obtained by integrating the momentum variable .",
    "it can be written as @xmath38 with @xmath39    as mentioned above the talbot - lau effect operates in the near - field regime , where the fact that the gratings have a finite lateral extension does not play a role ; it only affects the overall count rate .",
    "it is therefore permissible to describe the gratings by idealized functions that are periodic on an infinite plane . moreover , since the setup is invariant with respect to changes in the vertical position , it is sufficient to consider the wigner function and the grating transmissions only as a function of the horizontal  coordinates @xmath40 , see fig .",
    "[ drawing ] .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    we take the first grating to have a period @xmath41 , and its transmission function to be given by @xmath42 .",
    "likewise , the second grating has the fourier coefficients @xmath43 and the period @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 and @xmath46    in order to simplify the discussion and to avoid an overly complicated notation we focus on the _ symmetric _ talbot - lau setup , which is the most important one in practice ; for the asymmetric setup see @xcite and note . with @xmath47 , a period of @xmath48",
    "is needed in the first grating .",
    "analogously to the symmetric case ( [ eq : qdensity ] ) a density pattern emerges at @xmath37 which has now a period of @xmath49 .",
    "the case @xmath50 is called the _ fractional _ talbot - lau effect , and it is easily incorporated into the present framework . ] in this case the gratings are set at an equal distance @xmath51 and the periods @xmath41 and @xmath52 of the first and second grating are related by @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "( the case of equal grating periods , @xmath55 , is most common @xcite . )",
    "the state ( [ eq : w3general ] ) now reads@xmath56 here we introduced the _ talbot length _ @xmath57 in terms of the grating period @xmath52 and the de broglie wavelength @xmath58 the talbot length is the proper scale to distinguish near - field ( fresnel ) diffraction from far - field ( fraunhofer ) diffraction for a given wavelength .",
    "it gives the distance behind a grating where the diffraction peaks of a collimated , passing beam have a lateral separation equal to the grating period @xmath52 .",
    "to get the particle density in the beam from ( [ eq : w3 ] ) we integrate over the momentum @xmath59 which picks up the @xmath60 components , ) a normalizable momentum distribution would be needed in the initial wigner function . ] @xmath61 with fourier components @xcite @xmath62 equation ( [ eq : qdensity ] ) predicts a density pattern which has the same period @xmath41 as the first grating .",
    "often the spatial resolution of detectors is too poor to detect these density oscillations directly in an experiment .",
    "however , an indirect observation is possible with the help of a third grating with period @xmath41 . if put at the position of the density pattern it modulates the total transmission as a function of its lateral position @xmath63",
    "the integrated transmission , which is much easier to detect , is then given by @xmath64 if we choose the first and third grating to be identical , @xmath65 , the expected periodic signal is given by the expression @xmath66 for _ symmetric _ gratings this modulation signal has a visibility ) and ( [ eq : cvisibility ] ) assume that the transmission signal is extremal at @xmath67 and @xmath68 which is the case for realistic transmission functions with @xmath69 . ] @xmath70 which serves as the prime characterization of the interference pattern .",
    "it is clear from the definition of the coefficients @xmath71 that the interference pattern ( [ eq : qdensity ] ) and the visibility ( [ eq : qvisibility ] ) depend strongly on both the wavelength @xmath72 and on the separation @xmath27 between the gratings . as evident from ( [ eq : bdefx ] ) it is indeed the product of the two quantities which determines the pattern , since @xmath73 .",
    "however , the detection of a periodic signal alone does not prove necessarily that quantum interference occurred in the experiment because a certain density pattern may also be expected from a generalized moir effect . to establish the observation of quantum interference",
    "one must show that the observed visibility differs significantly from the classical expectation .",
    "it is therefore important to have a reliable quantitative prediction for the classical expectation as well .      with the results for the wigner function at hand it is straightforward to repeat the calculation using classical phase space dynamics .",
    "the classical phase space density @xmath23 transforms under free evolution like the wigner function ( [ eq : freetrafo1 ] ) according to @xmath74 in contrast to ( [ eq : tdef ] ) , the convolution kernel for passing through an ideal amplitude grating is now given by @xmath75 which leads to @xmath76 at a distance @xmath12 after the second grating this yields a phase space distribution @xmath77 which can also be obtained from the quantum result by replacing @xmath34 by @xmath78 in ( [ eq : w3general ] ) .",
    "it follows that the classical density pattern in front of the third grating is given by @xmath79 with @xmath80 the comparison with ( [ eq : qdensity ] ) shows that the quantum and the classical results have the same form , but differ in the fourier components @xmath81 . of course , the classical fourier components do not depend on the de broglie wavelength .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath82 may be viewed as the short - wave limit @xmath83 of the quantum fourier coefficients @xmath71 , which is already indicated by the notation .",
    "it follows immediately that the classical prediction for the signal is obtained from ( [ eq : qsignal2 ] ) by replacing the wavelength dependent fourier components @xmath71 by the @xmath82,@xmath84 likewise one can show that the visibility of the classical signal is given , for symmetric gratings , by @xmath85    let us focus on the important case of equal grating periods for a moment , i.e. , @xmath55 . in this case only the even fourier components @xmath86 are needed . if the separation @xmath27 between the gratings is set to an integer multiple of the talbot length , then it is easy to convince oneself that for any ideal grating @xmath87 @xmath88 that is , the quantum and the classical evolution yield _ identical _ predictions for the density pattern and the observed visibility .",
    "this shows clearly that the observation of the integer talbot - lau effect alone does not prove the wave nature of the beam particles .",
    "however , unlike their classical counterparts , the quantum fourier components display a strong wavelength dependence .",
    "therefore , distinctively different results are obtained in the classical and the quantum calculation for separations which differ from the integer talbot criterion , @xmath89 , or equivalently for detuned particle wavelengths , @xmath90 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : idealvisib ] where we show the quantum and classical visibilities for identical , ideal binary gratings as a function of their open fraction @xmath91 ( the ratio of slit width to grating period ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    as predicted by ( [ eq : theyareequal ] ) the quantum and classical results are identical for @xmath92 and given by fig .",

    "[ fig : idealvisib](b ) ) and @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idealvisib](c ) ) on the other hand , the talbot - lau visibilities differ markedly while the classical predictions remain on fig .",
    "[ fig : idealvisib](a ) .",
    "the distinction between the classical and the quantum predictions is most pronounced for an opening fraction of @xmath95 , where the classical contrast vanishes .",
    "the quantum calculation yields significant visibilities for these gratings , of @xmath96 at @xmath93 and @xmath97 at @xmath94 , respectively .      in the above calculations the particle beam that enters",
    "the interferometer was assumed to have a fixed velocity in the @xmath98-direction and to be completely uncollimated in the transverse direction .",
    "of course this is an idealization that is in many respects as unrealistic as the familiar assumption of a perfectly coherent plane wave .",
    "realistic particle beams are characterized by a finite longitudinal coherence and show some correlations in the transverse direction .",
    "the particle beams used in matter wave interferometry are usually generated by an effusive or supersonic expansion into a vacuum chamber @xcite . by means of additional skimmers or collimators the beam",
    "is restricted to a well - defined longitudinal  direction .",
    "the beam is stationary , and as a consequence the longitudinal momenta show no off - diagonal elements in their density matrix @xcite .",
    "they are completely characterized by the longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the transverse momenta are much smaller than the longitudinal ones and can be taken to be uncorrelated with the longitudinal velocity .",
    "the transverse coherence is determined by the source aperture @xcite , and it could be calculated with the van  cittert - zernike theorem @xcite if the aperture size were small compared to the length scale in question . however , in the talbot - lau setup the source aperture is much larger than the spacing between the grating slits . as a consequence ,",
    "diffraction at the first grating can not be observed and it is permissible to approximate the transverse degrees of freedom as completely uncollimated . in front of the first grating",
    "the bulk of the beam is therefore appropriately characterized by the wigner function , @xmath100 for @xmath101 with @xmath102 this description does not account for the edges of the beam and the cut - off at larger transverse momenta , which is why it can not be properly normalized .",
    "fortunately , it is not necessary to include the full beam profile in the treatment of the talbot - lau effect . as shown below only the interference of paths through a few neighboring slits is relevant for the effect , so that the transverse variation of the total current can be neglected .",
    "formally , the beam ( [ eq : w3d ] ) can be written as a convex sum of states @xmath103 that are uniform in the transverse coordinates @xmath104 and @xmath24 , and that have a fixed longitudinal momentum @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath105 those are the states @xmath103 that we started out with in sect .  [",

    "[ sec : tlsetup ] and [ sec : class ] over the longitudinal velocity distribution .",
    "in particular , the modulation signals ( [ eq : qsignal2 ] ) and ( [ csignal ] ) are given by @xmath109 if the detection signal is proportional to the flux the average involves the longitudinal velocity component ,  @xmath110 note that in either case the visibilities are not obtained by a simple average of ( [ eq : qvisibility ] ) and ( [ eq : cvisibility ] ) , but have to be calculated from the averaged signal .",
    "so far it has been assumed that the gratings are ideal in the sense that their thickness could be neglected . however , real gratings have a finite thickness and the time of interaction between the particle and the grating depends on the velocity @xmath111 of the beam particles .",
    "this introduces a velocity dependence of the grating function both in the classical and in the quantum treatments . generally speaking , the talbot - lau effect is affected more strongly by the grating forces than far - field diffraction @xcite , since the near - field interference is characterized by smaller phase shifts .",
    "this was seen in recent experiments with beams of large molecules @xcite .",
    "in order to account for the effect of a finite grating thickness @xmath112 we consider an additional interaction potential @xmath113 that acts while the particle is traversing the grating . in order to avoid a more detailed @xmath98-dependence in the potential we average over the the surface roughness and",
    "assume that the grating walls are parallel to the optical axis and that edge effects can be neglected . in the case of tilted walls",
    "one can introduce an effective slit width , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known @xcite that grating interaction effects are usually well described by the _ eikonal approximation_. there , the additional quantum phase due to the interaction potential @xmath113 is obtained by integrating the action along a straight path . accordingly ,",

    "position @xmath125 with the interaction time . accordingly , the classical phase space distribution changes as @xmath126 when passing a grating .",
    "using this transformation and the periodicity of @xmath127 one finds that the classical expressions for the density pattern and for the signal visibility assume the forms ( [ eq : cdensity ] ) and ( [ eq : cvisibility ] ) as in the ideal case .",
    "one merely has to replace the fourier components by @xmath128 with @xmath129 we note that the modifications of the fourier components given by ( [ eq : btilde ] ) and ( [ eq : bnulltilde ] ) describe the quantum and the classical interactions on the same degree of approximation .",
    "clearly , the fact that the interaction with the grating is treated equally in the quantum and in the classical descriptions is an important requirement for identifying quantum interference in an experimental observation .    before turning to realistic descriptions for the grating interaction we note that it is in general not necessary to include the grating interaction at the first and third gratings .",
    "this is clear from the fact that the talbot - lau setup is sensitive to diffraction only at the second grating , while the others merely serve to modulate the flux .",

    "recently , our theory was successfully applied to describe experiments with large molecules @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the discussion of decoherence effects in the present article was confined to those mechanisms most relevant in the interference of fullerenes and biomolecules .",
    "indeed , the interaction with gas molecules and the emission of heat radiation are expected to be relevant sources of decoherence for all large particles .",
    "our formulation applies immediately to those since the bulk properties of the particles , such as the polarizability or the absorption cross section , were used to describe the environmental coupling .",
    "other decoherence effects might become relevant as the particles increase further in complexity .",
    "in particular , those couplings that entangle the center - of mass motion with the rotation of the particle or with its internal degrees of freedom become sources of decoherence . in these cases the observed loss of visibility , which is inevitable if the detection is insensitive to the relative coordinates , can be calculated with the same approach as discussed above .",
    "the grating interaction will also require a more refined treatment at some point .",
    "the eikonal approximation ceases to be valid for particles of increasing size , because they interact stronger and at the same time they will have a longer interaction time",
    ". a more careful evaluation of the propagation through the grating will be needed in those cases .",
    "a final remark concerns the ease of incorporating decoherence effects in the present formulation of matter wave interference .",
    "it draws heavily on the fact that one is able to separate the rate of decoherence events from their effect .",
    "it seems that this approach , that avoids the solution of a master equation in time , can be a transparent way of treating markovian dynamics .",
    "it is vindicated by the comparison with the more conventional solution of a corresponding markovian master equation that was presented in the last section of this article .",
