    "schaerer & vacca 1996 ) the wr population should be dominated by stars of the wc subtype if star formation occurs on timescales short compared to the lifetimes of massive stars .",
    "since the  @xmath35808 feature is usually weaker than the characteristic wr bump at @xmath0 4700    it may simply have been overlooked in many previous observations .",
    "interestingly , in the homogeneous sample of low metallicity  galaxies of izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1994 , 1997 ) , 5 out of 15 wr - rich objects show strong wc features , which corresponds surprisingly well to the theoretically predicted value of @xmath0 30 % .",

    "the total integration time of 5400 s was divided into 5 exposures ( 4 times 20 minutes plus 10 minutes ) in order to avoid saturation of the bright nebular lines (  and [ ] ) and to recognize cosmic ray impacts .",
    "the seeing was relatively stable during the observations with a mean spatial resolution of about 1 .",
    "the spectrum was aquired at low airmass ( @xmath0 1.1 ) and no correction for the loss of blue light due to atmospheric dispersion was made .",

    "these include bias subtraction , flat - field and airmass corrections , wavelength and flux calibrations , sky subtraction , and cosmic ray removal .",
    "the spatial distribution of emission - lines along the slit reveals the presence of two bright regions , hereafter called _ a _ ( for the brightest ) and _ b _ ( south of _ a _ ) , separated by about 3  ( 60 pc at a distance of 4.1 mpc ) .",

    "note that region 1 of wr89 ( = region a of wr87 ) contains both our regions _ a _ and _ b_. we also detected a region ( hereafter called _ h _ ) , located @xmath0 3  nne of _ a _ , for which no clear counterpart could be found in the hst images .",

    "the absence of a visible counterpart in any images ( cf .  above ) this region is not discussed further .",
    "future studies would be highly desirable .",

    "( = our @xmath16 region ) of ksrwr97 .",
    "one of the main results of this letter is the unambiguous detection of a broad ( fwhm = 62 and 86  )  @xmath35808 emission line in regions _ a _ and _ b _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] ) , which clearly indicates the presence of wc stars in these regions ( see   [ s_wrlines ] ) . a sufficiently high s / n is required for the detection of the  @xmath3 5808 line in integrated spectra of extragalactic  regions or alike objects , and to derive the observed frequency of wc stars in wr galaxies .",
    "this explains the non detection of this line in previous ground - based spectra of ngc 5253 ( ctm86 , wr87 , wr89 ) and in the recent hst fos spectrum of the region uv1 of ksrwr97 .",
    "interestingly , however , the presence of wc stars was suspected by wr89 based on a high carbon abundance derived from iue spectra ( cf .",
    "both from the relative strength of  @xmath34686 to  @xmath35808 and from the large fwhm of the latter line , wn stars can be ruled out as the origin of the  line .",
    "the observed fwhm ( @xmath0 70  ) of this line corresponds well to early type wc stars ( typically wc4 ; smith , shara & moffat 1990 ) including possibly also some wo3 - 4 stars : their @xmath35590 emission ( @xmath17 15 % of  @xmath35808 ) would remain undetectable . from the absence of @xmath35590 a significant number of wo1 - 2 stars can be excluded ( cf .",
    "kingsburgh , barlow & storey 1995 ) .",
    "similarly the absence of  @xmath35696 excludes a significant population of late type wc stars .",
    "the relative contributions of the /  @xmath134640,4650 blend and  @xmath34686 to the wr bump exclude a pure wc origin .",
    "the fwhm ( @xmath0 30  ) of  @xmath34686 agrees well with wnl stars ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ) .",
    "all broad emission line features therefore indicate a mixed population of wnl , and wc4 and/or wo3 - 4 stars in regions _ a _ and _ b_. this result is further supported by quantitative comparisons presented in   4 .",
    "the presence of intermediate type wn / wc stars can not be excluded .",
    "the approximate number of o and wr stars present in the observed regions can be estimated as follows . adopting the value @xmath18 from vacca & conti ( 1992 , hereafter vc92 ) for the lyman continuum luminosity of a o7v star and assuming case b recombination , we estimate @xmath0 865 ( 210 ) o7v stars in region _ a _ and in region _",
    "b _ from their  luminosity . these numbers are approximately @xmath0 5 and @xmath0 35 % lower , respectively , if we account for the contribution of the wr stars to the ionizing flux . depending on the age of the population and the imf slope",
    ", the number of o7v stars does not necessarily correspond well to the total number of o stars : most likely the total number of o stars is larger by a factor of @xmath0 2 and 4 for _ a _ and _ b _ respectively ( schaerer 1996 ) . using the average observed luminosity of wc4 stars in the  @xmath35808 line ( @xmath19 ; vc92 ) , the 5808 emission in regions a and b can be explained by 10 and 13 wc4 stars respectively . from the observed  @xmath34686 line luminosity we derive an upper limit of 25 wnl stars for _ a _ ( depending on nebular contribution ) and 39 wnl stars for _ b _ , using the average line luminosity given by vc92 .    to see whether the wnl , wc and o star populations are compatible with predictions from stellar evolution we use the recent evolutionary synthesis models of schaerer ( 1996 ) and schaerer & vacca ( 1996 ) , which allow direct comparisons to be made with the relevant observational quantities related to the wr and o star population ( fig .  [ fig_models ] panels b - d ) .",
    "the predictions are shown for instantaneous burst models at the appropriate metallicity for regions _ a _ and _ b _ ( z=0.004 , cf .",
    "wr89 , ksrwr97 ) , assuming a salpeter imf with an upper mass cut - off of @xmath20 120 .",
    "the observed line fluxes in the different wr lines ( in units of the  flux ) are shown as filled symbols .",
    "panel * a * illustrates the corresponding wr / o , wnl / o , and wc / o number ratios . figure [ fig_models ] shows that both the observed values of the wr lines fluxes and their variation with @xmath21 can be reasonably well reproduced by the models for z=0.004 . with several variations of the input parameters ( flatter imf , short burst duration , etc . )",
    "all the observed values can be matched with greater accuracy . in view of the uncertainties of the measurement for these weak lines we conclude  and all broad wr lines in both regions _ a _ and _ b _ are consistent with an approximately instantaneous burst .",
    "the strong wr features also imply the presence of very massive stars ( @xmath22 60 ) .    in the burst models a decrease of @xmath21 corresponds to an increasing age of the burst .",
    "the ages derived from our models correspond to @xmath0 2.8 myr for _ a _ and 4.4 myr for _ b_. as shown above this age sequence is also compatible with the wr line fluxes , which exhibit changes on short time scales .",
    "the non - detection of radio emission from snr in ngc  5253 supports the presence of very young nuclear starbursts ( less than 1 - 2 10@xmath23 yr , beck et al .",
    "does the presence of wc stars lead to the high excitation of the gas , and thus the nebular  emission as suggested by schaerer ( 1996 ) ? at the age of region _ a _ ( estimated from its large value of w ( ) ) the models of schaerer ( 1996 ) predict an important _ nebular _ contribution to the total  @xmath34686 emission due to the large fraction of wc stars in the burst . given the weakness of the 4686 line in this region , its width is quite uncertain .",
    "the presence of strong nebular lines of [ ] @xmath34658 and [ ] @xmath134711,4740 indicating high excitation resembles closely the cases of pox  4 ( cf .",
    "kunth & sargent 1981 ; vc92 ) and mkr  1271 ( contini 1996 ) where the distinction between broad stellar and nebular  is unclear .",
    "the observations of region _ a _ are thus compatible with wc stars as the origin of nebular  emission . at the age corresponding to region _",
    "b _ the models of schaerer ( 1996 ) predict only broad  emission , in agreement with the observations . compared to _ a _ , the weakness of the forbidden lines also indicates a lower excitation .      _",
    "the ionizing clusters : _ as pointed out by ksrwr97 the brightest uv cluster ( their uv1 which is included in our region _ b _ ) does not provide enough ionizing flux to explain the  surface brightness of ngc 5253 corresponding to @xmath24 photons s@xmath25 ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) derived assuming a constant extinction of @xmath11 0.47 . our observations , however , clearly reveal that region _ a _ ( corresponding to the optical maximum and also approximately to the   emission peak ) contains a larger number of o stars than region _",
    "b_. from  we obtain an ionizing lyman continuum flux of @xmath26 and @xmath27 photon s@xmath25 for regions _ a _ and _ b _ respectively .",
    "a _ is of higher extinction and thus clearly dominates the production of ionizing photons as compared to the brightest region in the uv . in view of the possible underestimation of extinction ( cf .",
    "beck et al . 1996 ) and the strong spatial extinction variations ( ksrwr97 , calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ) we suspect that the close area surrounding region _",
    "( possibly including also _ h _ ) may well produce enough ionizing photons to explain the total observed  surface brightness .",
    "_ wr stars and the chemical enrichment : _ local overabundance of nitrogen in several regions of ngc 5253 is well established ( wr87 , wr89 , ksrwr97 ) .",
    "the recent hst observations of ksrwr97 show n enrichment in two locations ( called hii-1 and hii-2 ) close to the peak of  emission (= our region _ a _ ) , while n / o in their region uv1 ( included in our region _ b _ ) seems to be typical for metal - poor galaxies . assuming that wr stars eject a significant amount of nitrogen , our likely detection of wr stars in _ a _ provides a plausible source of n in the very proximity of the n - enriched regions .",
    "region _ a _ , overlooked by ksrwr97 due to its low uv brightness , is thus most likely the `` hidden '' cluster containing the sources of the observed pollution .",
    "more generally , the detection of wr stars of both wn and wc subtypes in both of our regions raises several questions .",
    "the earlier finding of a possible carbon overabundance by wr89 , which originally lead these authors to suggest the presence of wc stars , was not confirmed by the results of ksrwr97 .",
    "if the overabundance of n ( in the regions close to _ a _ ) is due to wn stars , why are the ejecta of wc stars ( presumably mostly he , c and o ) not detected ?",
    "furthermore , why does region _",
    "b _ ( = uv1 ) , which also harbours wr stars , not show any significant overabundance ?",
    "abundance differences between these two regions might be related to their age difference : maybe mixing processes in _",
    "b _ had time to dilute the ejecta with the ambient medium , whereas the younger region _ a _ is currently in a phase of heavy pollution .",
    "hopefully a study of ngc 5253 will not only tell us its history of star formation but also more about still poorly understood nucleosynthetic yields in massive stars and mixing processes in the ism .",
