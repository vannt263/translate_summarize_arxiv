    "* application of a magnetic field to the superconductor induces a quantum phase transition at a non - zero critical field , @xmath2 , involving the onset of spin density wave ( sdw ) order .",

    ", width=384 ]    the parameter @xmath15 appears in a landau theory of sdw order and tunes the propensity to sdw order , with sdw order being favored with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "we highlight a number of notable features of this phase diagram :    1 .",
    "the upper - critical field above which superconductivity is lost , @xmath18 , decreases with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of competing orders , as decreasing @xmath15 enhances the sdw order , which in turn weakens the superconductivity .",
    "the sdw order is more stable in the non - superconducting ` normal ' state than in the superconductor . in other words ,",
    "the line cm , indicating the onset of sdw order in the normal state , is to the right of the point a where sdw order appears in the superconductor at zero field ; _ i.e. _ @xmath21 . thus inducing superconductivity destabilizes the sdw order , again as expected in a model of competing orders .",
    "an immediate consequence of the feature b is the existence of the line am of quantum phase transitions within the superconductor , representing @xmath2 , where sdw order appears with increasing @xmath22 . as we have discussed above , this prediction of demler _",
    "et al._@xcite has been verified in a number of experiments .    a related prediction by demler _",
    "_ @xcite that an applied current should enhance the sdw order , also appears to have been observed in a recent muon spin relaxation experiment.@xcite    a glance at fig .",
    "[ figdemler ] shows that it is natural to place @xcite the quantum oscillation experiments @xcite in the non - superconducting phase labeled `` sdw '' .",
    "feature b above is crucial in this identification : the normal state reached by suppressing superconductivity with a field is a regime where sdw order is more stable .",
    "the structure of the fermi surface in this normal state can be deduced in the framework of conventional spin - density - wave theory , and we recall the early results of refs .   in fig .",
    "[ figscs ] .",
    ", desribes ordering at the wavevector @xmath23 , and mixes fermion states whose wavevectors differ by @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to the sdw metal state with electron ( red ) and hole ( blue ) pockets in panel ( b ) , which is the state used here to explain the quantum oscillation experiments.@xcite , width=604 ]    recent studies @xcite have extended these results to incommensurate ordering wavevectors @xmath24 , and find that the electron pockets ( needed to explain the quantum oscillation experiments ) remain robust under deviations from the commensurate ordering at @xmath25 .",
    "the present paper will consider only the case of commensurate ordering with @xmath23 , as this avoids considerable additional complexity .",
    "the above phenomenological theory appears to provide a satisfactory framework for interpreting the experiments highlighted in this paper .",
    "however , such a theory can not ultimately be correct .",
    "a sign of this is that within its parameter space is a non - superconducting , non - sdw normal state at @xmath13 and @xmath26 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ figdemler ] ) .",
    "indeed , such a state is the point of departure for describing the onset of the superconducting and sdw order in ref .  .",
    "there is no such physically plausible state , and the parameters were chosen so that this state does not appear in fig .",
    "[ figdemler ] .",
    "furthermore , we would like to extend the theory to spectral properties of the electronic excitations probed in numerous other experiments .",
    "this requires a more microscopic formulation of the theory of competing orders in terms of the underlying electrons .",
    "we shall provide such a theory here , building upon the proposals of refs .  .",
    "our theory will not have the problematic @xmath13 , @xmath26 `` normal '' state of the phenomenological theory , and so can not be mapped precisely onto it .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that our theory does reproduce the key aspects of fig .",
    "[ figdemler ] .",
    "we will also use our theory to propose a finite temperature phase diagram for the hole - doped cuprates ; in particular , we will argue that it helps resolve a central puzzle on the location of the quantum critical point important for the finite temperature crossovers into the ` strange metal ' phase .",
    "these results appear in section  [ sec : conc ] and fig .",
    "[ figt ] .",
    "the theory of superconductivity @xcite mediated by exchange of quanta of the sdw order parameter , @xmath17 , has been successful above optimal doping .",
    "however , it does not appear to be compatible with the physics of competing orders in the underdoped regime , at least in its simplest version .",
    "this theory begins with the `` large fermi surface '' state in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ figscs ] , and examines its instability in a bcs / eliashberg theory due to attraction mediated by exchange of @xmath17 quanta .",
    "an increase in the fluctuations of @xmath17 is therefore connected to an increase in the effective attraction , and consequently a strengthening of the superconducting order .",
    "this is evident from the increase in the critical temperature for superconductivity as the sdw ordering transition is approached from the overdoped side ( see _ e.g. _ fig .  4 in ref .  ) .",
    "thus rather than a competition , this theory yields an effective attraction between the sdw and superconducting order parameters .",
    "this was also demonstrated in ref .   by a microscopic computation in this framework of the coupling between these order parameters .",
    "it is possible that these difficulties may be circumvented in more complex strong - coupling versions of this theory @xcite , but a simple physical picture of these is lacking .    as was already discussed in ref .",
    ", the missing ingredient in the sdw theory of the ordering of the metal is the knowledge of the proximity to the mott insulator in the underdoped compounds .",
    "numerical studies of models in which the strong local repulsion associated with mott insulator is implemented in a mean - field manner do appear to restore aspects of the picture of competing orders .",
    "@xcite here , we shall provide a detailed study of the model of the underdoped cuprates proposed in refs .  , and show that it is consistent with the features a , b , and c of the theory of competing orders noted above , which are essential in the interpretation of the experiments .    as discussed at some length in ref .",
    ", the driving force of the superconductivity in the underdoped regime is argued to be the pairing of the electron pockets visible in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figscs ] . experimental evidence for this proposal also appeared in the recent photoemission experiments of yang _",

    "[ figscs ] . further discussion on the hole pockets , and the reason for their secondary role in superconductivity may be found in refs .  .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the theory are the bosonic spinons @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and spinless fermions @xmath29 .",
    "the spinons determine the local orientation of the sdw order via @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the electrons are assumed to form electron and hole pockets as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figscs]b , but with their components determined in a ` rotating reference frame ' set by the local orientation of @xmath17 .",

    ", thermal fluctuations will also directly affect the sdw order , in addition to the indirect effect through suppression of superconductivity .",
    "in particular in two spatial dimensions there can be no long - range sdw order at any @xmath212 .",

    "going below @xmath110 in the underdoped regime , we eventually reach the regime controlled by the quantum critical point associated with sdw ordering in the superconductor , which is at @xmath215 . because @xmath216 , the sdw order can now be ` quantum disordered ' ( qd ) .",
