    "when diffuse gas is accreted on to a galaxy cluster , it inevitably goes through an accretion shock in the cluster outskirts .",
    "x - ray and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect observations now start to reach the sensitivities required to probe the outer regions of galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite for a review ) , and we may expect a direct detection of the accretion shock in the near future .",
    "this motivates our studying where we expect to find the accretion shock , as well as the properties of the intracluster gas in the bulk of the cluster volume .    in hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", there exists a complex network of accretion shocks outside the virial radius of a galaxy cluster due to the inhomogeneous distribution of matter there @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the peak of the entropy profile provides us with a unique practical definition of the radial position of the accretion shock @xcite .",
    "this definition of the shock radius is convenient particularly because it can also be inferred from observations . using this definition ,",
    "@xcite found that the shock radius is slightly larger than , but tracks closely the splashback radius of the dark matter @xcite despite of the very different underlying physics .",
    "the two radii align with each other to an extent that the resulting ratio of gas density and dark matter density stays close to the cosmic mean value over a large radial range in the cluster outskirts ( fig.9 of @xcite ) , although the density jumps associated with the shock and splashback radii may easily cause a large deviation . moreover , both the accretion shock radius and the splashback radius scale well with @xmath2 - the radius within which the averaged density is 200 times the _ mean _ density of the universe , rather than the more commonly used @xmath3 ( for which the reference density is the _",
    "critical _ density of the universe ) which is better for scaling the cluster inner profiles @xcite .    to explore the origin of these curious behaviors , one needs to study the growth of galaxy clusters in an expanding universe by accreting matter around them . the self - similar spherical collapse model @xcite offers us the simplest analytical framework for doing this . with the self - similarity ansatz alone ,",
    "the self - similar spherical collapse model allows us to rigorously and consistently derive the self - similarity profiles of the collapsed regions , e.g. galaxy clusters .",
    "this distincts it from the other smooth accretion models @xcite which need further assumptions about the internal structure of the galaxy cluster .",
    "a somewhat overlooked fact is that the self - similar spherical collapse solutions given in @xcite have already captured an alignment between the accretion shock radius and the splashback radius , as well as some observed icm properties such as the slope of the entropy profile and the effective equation of state of the intracluster gas .",
    "however , @xcite studied only one particular shape of the initial density peak which corresponds to a particular mass accretion rate of a galaxy cluster . since the mass accretion rate is known to play an important role in determining the locations of the accretion shock , the splashback radius , as well as the icm profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is hard to tell whether the features captured by the @xcite model hold at an arbitrary mass accretion rate , or are just coincidences occurring at that particular mass accretion rate .    inspired by the success of the bertschinger model and motivated by this shortcoming ,",
    "we explore the properties of self - similar spherical collapse solutions systematically by extending bertschinger s scheme to various mass accretion rates .",
    "we also consider the effect of a different inner mass profile due to dynamical relaxation , and the dynamical effect of a finite baryon content ( @xcite considered only the case of a negligible baryon content , i.e. @xmath4 ) .",

    "we describe the self - similar spherical collapse and its various representations in sect.[sec : model ] . in sect.[sec : rshock ] we explore the physical origin of the accretion shock location , why it aligns well with the dark matter splashback radius , and how it is affected by a modification of the inner mass profile and a finite baryon fraction . in sect.[sec : icmprof ] we study the icm properties including the entropy profile , the effective equation of state of the intracluster gas , and the gas mass fraction .",

    "the profile of the initial mass excess we consider is of a power - law shape , @xmath5 . in an einstein de - sitter ( eds ) universe ,",
    "this initial overdensity profile implies a power - law mass growth @xmath6 of the halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these , together with a scale - free eds cosmological background , ensure that the growth of the halos is self - similar , as were the cases considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "self - similarity suggests that the trajectory of a single shell of matter ( matter at a certain lagrangian radius ) describes at the same time the positions of all the shells in one snapshot , i.e. the profile of the matter distribution .",
    "in fact , the trajectories and profiles couple in the dynamical equations , and thus need to be solved together .",

    "the shock jump conditions express the continuity of mass , momentum and enthalpy across the shock front . given the properties of shock - bounded matter inside the halo , the accretion shock must occur at a position where the properties of the inflowing matter allow these continuities .",
    "here , we use the simple framework of self - similar spherical collapse model to give approximations for both the pre - shock flow and the post - shock halo gas , and show that combining the two indeed sets the location of the accretion shock .",
    "the infall velocity of the pre - shock flow relates to the shock position @xmath45 through the conservation of the sum of kinetic and gravitational energy of the infalling gas .",
    "namely , the kinetic energy at the position of the accretion shock should equal the difference of the gravitational energies at the accretion shock and the turn - around locations . expressed in a dimensionless form ,",
    "it is @xmath69 or in terms of the dimensionless pre - shock velocity @xmath55 ( see table1 ) , @xmath70 here we have taken the mass enclosed in the infalling shell to be a constant , which holds unless accretion shock happens significantly inside the splashback radius of the dark matter .",

    "the precise value of @xmath75 is slightly smaller than 2 and varies with the accretion rate and the adiabatic index of the gas ( see fig.[fig : traj2 ] ) ] , confirming that the accretion shock position is determined from the continuities of the halo gas which is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium and the pre - shock gas which carries kinetic energy gained during the gravitational infall .",
    "it also helps us to understand the parameter dependencies ( fig.[fig : shockpos_gamma ] and table.2 ) : both a smaller adiabatic index @xmath51 and a larger accretion rate @xmath28 require a larger pre - shock velocity @xmath55 at a certain shock position @xmath45 to satisfy the shock jump conditions eq.([eq : v2approx0 ] ) , which implies a smaller @xmath67 since it allows more conversion of the gravitational energy ( eq.[eq : econserv_infall ] ) and thus gives a higher pre - shock velocity .",

    "it was already noticed by @xcite that this result holds true only for a gas with an adiabatic index @xmath0 , for an accretion rate he studied .",
    "we extend his analysis to an arbitrary value of the accretion rate . in fig.[fig : shockpos_gamma ] , we show the positions of the splashback radius with the horizontal dashed lines . we find that , for and only for @xmath76 , the accretion shock position aligns well with the splashback radius for all the tested accretion rates .",
    "the mystery is then two - folds : why for @xmath0 , and more intriguingly , why does this alignment hold at @xmath0 for any accretion rate ?    to find the answers we now consider the origin of the splashback radius of the dark matter .",
    "initially , the dark matter shares the same expansion and infall with the gas and obeys eq.([eq : econserv_infall_f ] ) .",
    "it then enters the multi - stream region when it reaches @xmath35 , and starts to oscillate around the cluster center in the potential well of the cluster . the approximate position of the splashback radius",

    "the two regimes of accretion @xmath79 and @xmath80 correspond to an approximately constant inner gravitational potential well and one growing with time , respectively . due to the increase of the turn - around radius @xmath16 with time , the amplitude of the oscillation in terms of @xmath26 decreases with time ( fig.[fig : traj1 ] ) even when @xmath79 , and thus @xmath81 for all non - vanishing mass accretion rates .",
    "the alignment of the two radii holds for an adiabatic gas with @xmath76 for @xmath82 suggests that for this range of mass accretion rates , the dynamical effect of the accretion shock on a @xmath76 gas mimicks that of the growth of the cluster and @xmath16 on the dark matter .",
    "the value @xmath0 reflects nothing more fundamental , and may not apply for more extreme mass accretion rates either .",
    "in fact , combining the approximate expressions for @xmath45 ( sect.[sec : origin_rsh ] ) and @xmath45 ( eq.[eq : lambda_sp ] ) suggests that for higher mass accretion rates @xmath83 , harder adiabatic indices ( @xmath84 ) are required for the accretion shock position to align with the splashback radius .    both the accretion shock and the splashback radius decrease with a higher mass accretion rate but for different reasons . for the gas ,",
    "it is because a higher mass accretion rate @xmath28 suggests higher energy and momentum of the inflowing gas , whereas for the dark matter , it is due to a more significant cluster growth during the time between the splashback and when the matter at splashback was accreted . that their dependencies on the mass accretion rate are so similar for the range of accretion rates we tested is likely just a coincidence .",
    "compared to the splashback position of dark matter ( black crosses ) for various accretion rates @xmath28 .",
    "the shock radius is computed with various total mass profiles , including a self - similar profile ( blue markers ) and that with inner profile modified to an nfw shape ( magenta markers ) , both with @xmath86 ( ` o ' ) or @xmath87 ( ` + ' ) . ]    [ tab : lambd_sh_sp ]    how representative is the accretion shock radius from the @xmath88 self - similar solution that has a power - law inner mass profile ?",
    "here we explore the influence of a finite baryon content @xmath87 close to the observed values @xcite and a more realistic nfw mass profile @xcite on the accretion shock position .",
    "both the two modifications should influence the accretion shock position through their change to the total mass profile .",
    "since the self - similar solutions of the gas and dark matter mass profiles in the @xmath89 case are very similar for a @xmath52 gas ( fig.[fig : gasprofs_selfsim ] ) , the change to the total mass profile by a moderate baryon content is expected to be small , and thus a direct modification of the shape of the inner mass profile to an nfw profile is expected to give a greater change to the accretion shock position .    the way we embed an nfw profile in the inner region of the halo follows that of @xcite .",
    "we determine the concentration parameter @xmath90 by requesting that the slope of the nfw profile at the virial radius is equal to the inner mass slope @xmath91 of the self - similar solution , i.e. @xmath92 with @xmath93 , and the asymptotic inner dark matter mass slope as derived by @xcite @xmath94    the results confirm our expectations on the changes to the accretion shock radius ( fig.[fig : lambd_sh ] and table.3 ) , and also shows that even modifying the inner total mass profile from the self - similar solution to an nfw profile only slightly increases the shock radius .",
    "for a first - order estimation , the effect of relaxation and a moderate nonzero baryon content on the accretion shock position can be neglected value on the concentration parameter of nfw - shape halos @xcite . ] .",
    "analytical models based on a smooth accretion picture have been successful in explaining some basic observed properties of the icm , in particular its entropy profile @xcite , despite the cluster growth being partly clumpy rather than smooth .",
    "here we show that , even with the self - similar spherical collapse model which perhaps can be considered as the simplest smooth accretion model , some of the observed icm properties are already captured , and insights on their underlying physics can be obtained .",
    "since the gas is considered as adiabatic after the accretion shock in the self - similar spherical collapse model , the effects of radiative cooling and feedback processes are absent in our results .",
    "this needs to be kept in mind when interpreting the icm properties especially in the cluster core region where these effects are significant .",
    "the @xmath95 profile in the self - similar solution is close to a power - law inside the accretion shock ( fig.[fig : gasprofs_selfsim ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that the gas density , entropy , and pressure profiles are also approximately of power - law shape ( see the next subsection ) . for a small accretion rate @xmath66 ,",
    "the power - law slope @xmath96 of @xmath95 is almost identical to that of @xmath97 , because the both the trajectory of a shell of gas and the apoapsis of the dark matter trajectory approach a finite eulerian radius ( fig.[fig : traj2 ] ) .",
    "for a larger accretion rate , the trajectory of a gas shell still stops at a finite radius , but the orbit of a dark matter shell continues to shrink in amplitude , and thus leads to a shallower mass slope than that of the gas .",
    "the above physical picture motivates us to find an approximation for @xmath96 based on the asymptotic mass slope for the dark matter @xmath91 , which takes account of the additional steepening of gas mass slope compared to that of the dark matter at large accretion rates , @xmath98 the slope @xmath96 monotonously steepens with accretion rate @xmath28 , and ranges from 0.8 for @xmath99 to 1.4 for @xmath100 ( fig.[fig : slopes ] ) . for a mass accretion rate @xmath101 , the mass slope depends also on the adiabatic index of the gas , and the expression above is valid only for @xmath52 ( see appendix.[app : icm_gamma ] ) .",

    "being constant in adiabatic processes , entropy records the heating and cooling history of the icm .",
    "thus the entropy profile is a very useful physical property that describes the structure of the icm .",
    "the key idea of the smooth accretion models is that the entropy distribution in the icm is primarily set by the cluster s mass accretion history , i.e. the entropy and the mass of the gas are correlated .",
    "since the post - shock flow is adiabatic , the entropy of the gas is set at the accretion shock in a smooth accretion model .",
    "the intracluster gas entropy can thus be used as a lagrangian variable like the gas mass @xmath95 , and therefore a simple relation between the two is expected .    combining the mass and entropy integrals ( appendices.[sec : massint ] and [ sec : entint ] )",

    "considering that the mass accretion rate may change ( even significantly ) throughout the assembly of a galaxy cluster , a more generalized version of this relation is @xmath106 , that the local logarithmic slopes of the entropy and gas mass profiles are linearly related with a pre - factor depending on the accretion rate . since both the entropy and the gas mass can be inferred directly from x - ray and millimetre observations of galaxy clusters , it would be interesting to test this generalised relation in observations and numerical simulations to see to which degree it holds in a more realistic mass accretion scenario as well as when secondary effects such as cooling and additional ways of entropy injection e.g. agn feedback are present . in case",
    "the relation holds well in more realistic conditions , testing how the relation between entropy and gas mass slopes depends on the mass accretion rate in simulations may potentially lead to a method of inferring the mass accretion history . with eqs.([eq : slope_m ] ) and ( [ eq : km ] ) we can estimate the logarithmic slope of the entropy profile as @xmath107 remarkably , although both @xmath108 and the gas mass slope @xmath96 vary quite significantly with the accretion rate , the value of the entropy slope stays within a small range @xmath109 ( fig.[fig : slopes ] ) .",
    "the inferred values of the entropy slope also match with that of the ` baseline intracluster entropy profile ' @xcite , which presents the theoretical expectation from a smooth accretion model as well as from adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "many observed entropy profiles do follow a power - law shape with a similar slope between the cluster core regions where they are significantly modified by cooling and feedback processes , and the cluster outskirts where the measurement becomes much harder and still controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and referenced therein ) .",

    "this is in agreement with the weak positive correlation between @xmath111 and the concentration parameter of the dark matter halo found in @xcite to match the accretion rate and the concentration parameter , our accretion rate dependence of @xmath111 agrees with the @xcite fitting formula ( their equation 17 ) both in their trends and also quantitatively to @xmath1175% for @xmath118 .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility of this being a coincidence , this makes it more interesting to look for this weak but monotonous dependence of @xmath111 on the accretion rate or on the concentration parameter in hydrodynamical simulations and observations . ] .",
    "this effective polytropic index @xmath111 differs physically from the polytropic index , or the adiabatic index of the gas @xmath51 .",
    "while the latter reflects how the gas pressure changes under compression or expansion , the former is merely an effective description of the global icm structure .",
    "nevertheless , one may wonder why the icm structure is characterised by an effective polytropic index @xmath119 . from the relation eq.([eq : slope_gamma ] ) above , the value of @xmath111 is set by the @xmath120 relation which describes the entropy generation during mass accretion , and the gas mass profile itself value of @xmath1 does not require a near linear relation between @xmath121 and @xmath95 as stated there . ] . that @xmath119 is simply due to a positive slope of the entropy profile @xmath114 as a result of an increasing entropy production at the accretion shock with growing mass of the cluster .      .",
    "]    in observations , the gas mass fraction @xmath122 is typically found to be less than the cosmic mean value at small radii , and approaches the cosmic mean around the virial radius of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has been commonly regarded as evidence for feedback by e.g. agns in the central galaxies which expels the inner baryonic material to large radii and even out of the potential well of the halo .",
    "such an interpretation is supported by the observation of progressively more significant baryon loss from clusters of galaxies , groups of galaxies to galaxies themselves ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    here",
    "we consider an additional cause to the deviation of the gas mass fraction from the cosmic mean value : that gas lagging behind dark matter during its infall on to the cluster after going through the accretion shock .",
    "fig.[fig : fgas ] shows the gas mass fraction in the self - similar solutions as influenced by the accretion shock . unlike the entropy profile and the effective equation of state of the icm , we find the gas mass fraction to depend strongly on the mass accretion rate",
    ". the higher the mass accretion rate , the stronger the depletion of gas relative to the dark matter in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "the depletion is already more than 20% at @xmath123 for a mass accretion rate @xmath124 .",
    "this is again caused by the stronger adiabatic contraction at high accretion rates , which steepens the gravitational potential in the central regions and causes the orbits of the dark matter to contract further in comparison with the gas .",
    "since the effect of this accretion dynamics on the @xmath125 is most likely secondary to that of the agn feedback , the @xmath126 profiles presented here may not be realistic .",
    "nevertheless , the strong dependence of the inner gas fraction on the mass accretion rate found here may be observable , which encourages one to study this dependence in numerical simulations and in observations .",
    "in the hierarchical structure formation picture , galaxy clusters grow not all via smooth accretion as assumed in this paper and by other smooth accretion models . mergers and accretion through filaments are also significant modes of accretion .",
    "they destroy the lagrangian nature of the radial coordinate by mixing matter accreted at different times , and they introduce density inhomogeneities to the icm .",
    "quantitative effects of these are hard to evaluate and remain an open question .",
    "@xcite addressed the effect of density inhomogeneities in the material being accreted on the entropy of the icm .",
    "they find that a homogeneous accretion maximizes the observed entropy as a pure effect of mass - weighting during the averaging .",
    "similarly , mass - weighted accretion shock radius would be biased towards that of the higher density gas .",
    "as gas with slightly higher density carries more momentum per volume , it would get shocked at a smaller radius , and thus density inhomogeneities would lead to a smaller mass - weighted accretion shock radius .",
    "mixing of matter accreted at different times tends to wash out the dependence of the icm profiles on the mass accretion history .",
    "supposedly , it would at the same time drive the profiles towards a more ` relaxed ' state .",
    "however , since the icm structure given by smooth accretion models with a typical mass accretion history is generally already stable and smooth , the effect of this radial mixing may not be prominent in reality .      throughout the paper we have been studying the accretion shock location and the icm profiles in an einstein de - sitter universe where self - similarity strictly holds .",
    "how would our results change in a @xmath127cdm universe with a non - zero dark energy content ?",
    "the effect of dark energy is mainly on the dynamics of dark matter and gas before they turn around . within the turn - around radius",
    ", the gravity of the halo dominates and the role of dark energy is negligible . in this sense ,",
    "the effect of dark energy on the properties of the cluster region is through the initial condition at turn - around , and can partly be mimicked by a change of the mass accretion rate @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we expect the features that have little dependence on @xmath28 to remain in a @xmath127cdm universe , such as that the logarithmic slope of entropy profile and the effective polytropic index of the intracluster gas lying in a narrow range of  1.1 - 1.2 , and that the shock radius aligns well with the dark matter splashback radius for moderate accretion rates @xmath128 .",
    "the latter , combined with the origin of the good scaling between splashback radius and @xmath2 @xcite , would also suggest that the accretion shock scales well with @xmath2 for a similar reason : the correlated increase of the matter content of the universe and the average halo mass accretion rate with redshift , and their canceling effects on @xmath129 .",
    "quantitative estimations of the effect of dark energy requires an extension of the current framework to a @xmath127cdm universe , where the evolution of the cosmological background introduces an additional time scale to the system and breaks the strict self - similarity . in this case , we can consider the change of the cosmological background as described by e.g. the matter content @xmath130 as an adiabatic variable , and approximate the relatively fast dynamics of gas and dark matter as self - similar for each @xmath130 value .",
    "the extension for the dark matter has already been achieved in @xcite and have yielded results confirming our expectations .",
    "we leave the extension for the gas to future work .",
    "although simple and fully analytical , the self - similar spherical collapse model already captures some fundamental icm properties such as the location of the accretion shock , its alignment with the splashback radius , the entropy profile and the effective polytropic index of the intracluster gas .",
    "we have systematically studied the icm properties given by the self - similar spherical collapse model for dark matter and gas by extending bertschinger s work to various mass accretion rates .",
    "we also consider the effect of a different inner mass profile due to dynamical relaxation , and the effect of a moderate baryon content .",
    "our main findings can be summarised as follows .    *",
    "the radial position of the accretion shock is set by the continuities of mass , momentum and enthalpy between the approximately hydrostatic cluster gas and the gas being accreted by the cluster .",
    "neither a modification of the inner mass profile to an nfw shape due to dynamical relaxation nor the exact value of the baryon content has much effect on the accretion shock location . * the alignment of the accretion shock radius and splashback radius discovered in hydrodynamical simulations is _ not _ universal , in the sense that it holds only for a gas with an adiabatic index of @xmath0 and for not - too - high mass accretion rates . for the intergalactic gas for which @xmath0 , the alignment indeed holds for a large range of low and moderate accretion rates @xmath131 which are typical for galaxy clusters at low redshifts .",
    "this arises from the dependencies of the accretion shock and the splashback radius on the accretion rate , which are the same in direction and similar in degree , but different in physics . for the gas ,",
    "it is because the higher energy and momentum of the inflowing gas associated with a higher mass accretion rate . for the dark matter",
    ", it is due to a more significant halo growth during the time between the splashback and when the matter at splashback was accreted .",
    "* in the self - similar spherical collapse model , like in any smooth accretion model , the entropy distribution in the icm is set by the cluster s mass accretion history .",
    "however , the logarithmic slope of the entropy profile is rather independent of the mass accretion rate and lies around @xmath132 .",
    "this confirms the robustness of the ` baseline intracluster entropy profile ' of @xcite . *",
    "a linear relation exists between the local logarithmic slopes of the entropy and gas mass profiles , with a pre - factor depending on the mass accretion rate .",
    "although based on a heavily simplified picture , this relation is worth testing in hydrodynamical simulations and observations , and may lead to a method of constraining the mass accretion history of galaxy clusters from observations of the icm .",
    "* this effective polytropic index of the intracluster gas is an effective description of the global icm structure , and is set by the gas mass profile and the entropy generation during mass accretion .",
    "it also has a value around @xmath132 and is rather independent of the mass accretion rate .",
    "its value is smaller than that of the actual polytropic index ( the adiabatic index ) of the gas as a result of the cluster mass growth and the consequent increasing entropy production at the accretion shock . *",
    "the accretion shock slows down the gas compared to the dark matter during their accretion on to a galaxy cluster , and leads to a deficit of gas mass fraction compared to the cosmic mean in the inner regions of the cluster . unlike the entropy profile and the effective polytropic index of the icm",
    ", this effect depends strongly on the mass accretion rate of the cluster .",
    "this calls for simulation and observation studies of @xmath125 as a function of the mass accretion rate .",
