    "  @xcite .    since physical laws are usually expressed in terms of local differential equations , in order to be confident about the physical results one derives it is often necessary to have some degree of control over the topological structure of the space - time manifold so as to include constraints imposed by the topology  @xcite .",
    "one is then confronted with the question of what topologies are physically acceptable for a given space - time geometry .",
    "an approach to this problem is to study the possible observational ( or physical ) consequences of adopting particular topologies for the space - time  @xcite  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) .    in this work we study the role played by the compactness and the degree of connectedness in the time evolution of the energy of a radiating system in the flat frw space - times whose spacelike @xmath0 sections are endowed with seven different topologies , namely the simply connected 3-space @xmath1 , and six multiply connected orientable compact 3-manifolds obtained by suitable identifications of opposite faces of cubes ( four ) and of hexagonal prisms ( two ) after suitable turns  @xcite .    the radiating system we shall be concerned with is represented by a point - like harmonic oscillator ( energy source ) coupled with a relativistic massless scalar field  @xcite  ",

    "however , if such a cube is endowed with the euclidean geometry then the resulting three - space is not a manifold , but an orbifold  @xcite .",
    "this 3-space fails to be a manifold along the edges of the cube .",
    "only when the cube is endowed with the elliptic geometry the resulting space is indeed a manifold , namely the well known real projective space @xmath44 .",

    "the green function of @xmath60 is calculated summing up the contributions of each one of the point - like sources . since",
    "a scalar ray is a null geodesic , the distance travelled by each scalar wave front is a measure of the corresponding time travel , so the conformal time @xmath61 of arrival at @xmath62 will depend on the position at which each source is located .",

    "we shall consider now the radiation reaction equation of our energy source in @xmath48 .",
    "using the green function @xmath73 and ( [ inhoeq ] ) one finds @xmath74 $ ] , which can be used in ( [ motion2 ] ) to furnish the radiation reaction equation of our system .",
    "note that in these calculations the first term ( @xmath75 ) of the green function gives rise to the term @xmath76 , that formally diverges .",
    "a suitable renormalization procedure is therefore necessary .",
    "this resembles the need for renormalization one finds when dealing with accelerated point charges in classical electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we learn from  @xcite that a renormalization procedure can always be made in this case .",
    "this amounts to saying that for any @xmath77 , and any @xmath78 , one can always define an @xmath24-parameter family of frequencies @xmath79 by @xmath80 such that @xmath81 is a @xmath82-sequence that in the limit @xmath83 converges to the dirac delta @xmath84 .",
    "using now ( [ epsfam ] ) , in which we have made @xmath85 , one finds that , for arbitrary initial data @xmath86 , the renormalized radiation reaction equation of the source can be written in the form @xmath87 for any @xmath88 , and where @xmath89^{1/2}$ ] for all @xmath71 integers not all zero , @xmath90 and the step distribution @xmath91 for any @xmath92 , @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .",
    "note that the radiation reaction equation ( [ t1radeq ] ) contains an infinite , but countable , number of retarded terms .",
    "note also that , for a given pair of initial data ( @xmath95 ) , the continuity of @xmath28 and @xmath96 for all @xmath5 is sufficient to ensure that ( [ t1radeq ] ) can be integrated to give a unique solution .",
    "the next 3-manifolds we shall consider are @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath43 ( see table  [ flattops ] ) .",
    "the 3-space @xmath97 is a compact multiply connected flat three - dimensional riemannian manifold , obtained by identifying opposites faces of a cube , with a pair being identified after a rotation of @xmath99 of one face relative to the opposite face .",
    "the 3-manifold @xmath98 is obtained by identification of opposites faces of a cubic cell , but now a pair of faces are identified after a turn of @xmath100 ( see table  [ flattops ] ) .",
    "finally , the 3-manifold @xmath43 is obtained by pairwise identifying the faces of the cube according to figure 1 .",
    "for these 3-spaces the green functions for the wave operator can again be built by using the infinite grid of cubes picture .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that the grids of cubes corresponding to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are different .",

    "thus , for arbitrary initial data @xmath86 the radiation reaction equation in @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath43 reduces to ( [ t1radeq ] ) obtained for @xmath48 .",
    "a word of clarification is in order here : the above green functions for the wave operator for the 3-spaces @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) coincide only because in each case the point - like source is located at the center of the basic cell @xmath110 .",
    "this is so because although all these 3-spaces are locally homogeneous , the 3-spaces @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath43 are not globally homogeneous , thus the corresponding green functions of @xmath55 for @xmath111 are more involved and do not depend simply on the relative position between the source and the observer .    regarding the simply connected flat 3-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath112 ( @xmath0 section of the minkowski space - time ) , the green function for the wave operator @xmath113 is equal to the first term ( @xmath114 ) of @xmath73 appearing in ( [ greent1 ] ) .",

    "the 3-manifold @xmath117 can be similarly defined , but now the identification of the top and bottom faces ( regular hexagons ) is made after a turn of @xmath119 . in both cases",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the shortest distance between two opposite sides of the regular hexagon and by @xmath120 the height of the hexagonal prism cell .    for a point - like source located at the center of the basic cell ,",
    "the green functions for the wave operator in the 3-manifolds @xmath116 and @xmath117 are obviously the same .",
    "moreover they turn out to be similar to the green function  ( [ greent1 ] ) .",
    "but now instead of @xmath121 one has @xmath122 , where @xmath123 are integers , to locate the centers of the hexagonal prism cells in which @xmath1 has been tessellated .",
    "note that the number of images at a given distance from the point - like source clearly depends upon the ratio @xmath124 .",

    "we have also assumed the continuity of @xmath28 and @xmath96 , and chosen suitable values for the initial data @xmath130 and @xmath131 . for",
    "a neat comparison between the simply and multiply connected cases we have chosen @xmath132 , @xmath133 , the length @xmath134 , and for the heights of the hexagonal prism and three - torus we have taken @xmath135 and @xmath136 . as a matter of fact , our three - torus @xmath48 was obtained from a parallelepiped with edges @xmath137 , so @xmath138^{1/2}$ ] was used in equation ( [ t1radeq ] ) .",
    "further , we have also chosen as initial data @xmath139 , @xmath140 , which means that the initial energy of the source has been normalized , i.e. , @xmath141 .",

    "@xcite and _ maple _  @xcite the numerical integrations of the radiation reaction equations as well as the corresponding graphs for the energy function were obtained ( see figures 2 to 5 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the behavior of the energy with the time for the flat frw space - times , in which the @xmath0 sections are any of the orientable compact multiply connected 3-manifolds @xmath48 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 and @xmath43 for different ratios @xmath124 .",
    "note that @xmath120 is the height of the parallelepiped of square basis of side @xmath50 .",
    "the curves exhibit basically the same pattern , namely relative minima and maxima followed by a predominant growth of the energy with the time ( @xmath145 when @xmath146 ) .",
    "these extrema are related to the contribution of the discrete retarded terms ( the right hand side of the radiation reaction equation ) demanded by the compactness and the corresponding connectedness of these manifolds .",
    "the fact that the relative extrema occur at different times and are of different amplitudes ( intensities ) for distinct tessellations ( different ratios @xmath124 ) of the covering manifold , basically reveals the differences in their degree of connectedness ( returning rays take different times to return to the origin ) .",

    "although for the case ( iii ) one clearly has radiation damping , we have not been able to find out so far a closed formal proof of the asymptotical behavior for the other two cases .",
    "we emphasize , nevertheless , that the net role played by the connectedness and compactness can be better singled out in the static cases , where the dynamical degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "the study of that role for the static cases is in fact the major aim of the present work .",

    "the unexpected ( unphysical ? )",
    "growth of the energy with the time for the above compact flat 3-manifolds cases illustrates that non - trivial topologies can induce rather important dynamic changes in the behavior of a physical system .",
    "this type of sensitivity has been refered to as _",
    "topological fragility _ and can occur without violation of any local physical law  @xcite . a rigorous _ non - numerical _ analysis of the reasons for this surprising divergent behavior of @xmath2",
    "when compact flat frw space - times are considered has been carried out , and we hope to publish our results shortly elsewhere .",
    "we anticipate , however , that the causes for such a behavior lie in the compactness of the manifold in at least one direction , on the one hand , and in the type of coupling between @xmath28 and @xmath27 , on the other hand .    a possible physical measure of the degree of connectedness in these _ compact _ 3-manifolds can be made through the study of the number of emitted rays that return to the origin within a given lapse of time . according to this concept of degree of connectedness one learns from figures 2 , 3 and 4 that the greater is the degree of connectedness the earlier is the occurrence of the first relative minimum in the energy function .",
    "incidentally , note that the extension of this concept of degree of connectedness to non - compact 3-manifolds implies that @xmath1 has a null degree of connectedness .",
    "this , of course , is indicated in figure 4 , which shows a net exponential decay of the energy with the time ; no relative minima and maxima come about , which means that no ray returns to the origin .",
    "a simple inspection of the graphs for @xmath2 clearly shows that the derivative @xmath166 of the energy function is discontinuous at a few points .",
    "indeed , for the static case , for example , using ( [ t1radeq ] ) one obtains @xmath167 \\,.\\ ] ] from this equation one sees that the discontinuities occur at @xmath168 , that is , they come about each time a new term @xmath169 is taken into account in the right hand side of ( [ t1radeq ] ) .",
    "a question which naturally arises here is whether the inverse problem , i.e. that of determining the basic cell ( topology ) corresponding to the spacelike @xmath7 sections from the graphs of the energy @xmath2 , can be solved . regarding this problem",
    "it is clear that one can find the distances of the point - like source to its images by using where the discontinuities of @xmath170 take place , and the number of images at a given distance through the magnitude of the corresponding discontinuities .",
    "so , one can probe the topology of the 3-spaces at least in a few cases .",
    "it is not yet clear whether an algorithm for solving the inverse problem for the most general ( euclidean ) setting can be found , though .    as far as we are aware",
    "@xcite this is the first work in which a physical consequence of adopting the flat hexagonal prisms @xmath116 and @xmath117 has been studied .",
    "it is of worth to emphasize that when the expansion of the universe is considered the degree of connectedness is less than the ones for the static cases . for the manifold @xmath171",
    "this can be seen by comparing figure 2 ( static case @xmath172 ) and figure 5 ( monotone expansions @xmath173 ) .    before closing this article",
    "we should like to stress that our study does not cover all possible spatially compact orientable flat frw manifolds .",
    "thus , for example , we have not considered that for the 3-manifolds @xmath48 and @xmath98 the basis of the basic cell need not to be a square , it can be a parallelogram .",
    "the restriction we have made , however , does not seem to be decisive for the patterns of the behavior of the energy with the time we have found .    to conclude we remark that the study of radiation damping in elliptic ( @xmath174 ) frw manifolds in which the @xmath7 sections are endowed with different ( orientable compact ) topologies is being carried out .",

    "<S> we study the role played by the compactness and the degree of connectedness in the time evolution of the energy of a radiating system in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - times whose @xmath0 spacelike sections are the euclidean 3-manifold @xmath1 and six topologically non - equivalent flat orientable compact multiply connected riemannian 3-manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> an exponential damping of the energy @xmath2 is present in the @xmath1 case , whereas for the six compact flat 3-spaces it is found basically the same pattern for the evolution of the energy , namely relative minima and maxima occurring at different times ( depending on the degree of connectedness ) followed by a growth of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> likely reasons for this divergent behavior of @xmath2 in these compact flat 3-manifolds are discussed and further developments are indicated . a misinterpretation of wolf s results regarding one of the six orientable compact flat 3-manifolds is also indicated and rectified . </S>"
