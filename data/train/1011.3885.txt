    "it raises the hope for realizing the qahe in a two - band model of two - dimensional magnetic insulators @xcite .",
    "candidate materials for this effect , hgte doped with mn @xcite and a tetradymite semiconductors doped with transition metal elements @xcite , have been predicted .",

    "the qahe has also been proposed for cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "another advance is the search for topological phases with non - abelian anyons @xcite that have potential applications for quantum computing @xcite .",

    ", we study the qahe for a class of two - component haldane models on a square lattice .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom represented by the components depend on the microscopic details : the real spins of electrons , band indices @xcite , the top - bottom surface states of three - dimensional topological insulator @xcite , as well as the sublattice indices as exemplified below .",
    "we show that , in a pseudospin representation , the qahe system can be transformed into a chiral @xmath0-wave pairing state involving both pseudospin components .",

    "specifically , a topological phase transition from the hall conductance @xmath4 to @xmath5 happens for sufficiently strong proximity induced pairing because one of the pseudospin components is driven to a strong pairing state analogous to that in the @xmath6 double - layer fractional qhe discussed by ho @xcite and read and green @xcite .",
