    "2 , it is very difficult to understand several key features of the kilohertz qpos , including the simultaneous occurrence of two kilohertz qpos , in terms of the magnetospheric beat - frequency model .",
    "here we propose a model for the kilohertz qpos that is fundamentally different from the magnetospheric beat - frequency model . in the model presented here ,",
    "the x - ray source is a neutron star with a surface magnetic field @xmath17  g and a spin frequency of a few hundred hertz , accreting gas via a keplerian disk . in this model",
    "the key characteristics of the kilohertz qpos are explained as follows ( details are presented in ",
    "3 ) :    _ accretion flow_.magnetoturbulence , differentialcooling , and radiation forces create density inhomogeneities ( `` clumps '' ) in the gas in the nearly keplerian disk flow .",
    "these clumps are dissipated by the shear in the azimuthal velocity combined with gas pressure forces and turbulence .",
    "if the neutron star has a magnetic field @xmath18  g , some of the accreting gas is channeled out of the disk flow by the stellar magnetic field .",
    "channeling occurs at several stellar radii , if the stellar magnetic field is @xmath19@xmath20  g , but only very close to the stellar surface , if the field is @xmath21@xmath22  g. even if the field is as strong as @xmath19@xmath20  g , some of the accreting gas continues to drift inward in a nearly keplerian disk flow until either radiation drag forces become important , the gas reaches the innermost stable circular orbit , or the gas begins to interact viscously with the stellar surface .",
    "the fraction of the accreting gas that remains in the keplerian flow close to the star depends primarily on the strength of the stellar magnetic field and the accretion rate .",
    "_ role of radiation drag and general relativity_.for the accretion rates typical of the z and atoll sources , the nearly keplerian flow ends and the inward radial velocity of the gas in the disk increases sharply as the gas nears the star , either because of the azimuthal drag force exerted on the gas in the disk by the radiation coming from near the stellar surface or  if the drag force is weak and the radius of the neutron star is less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit  because of the general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity that produce an innermost stable orbit . in either case , the inward radial velocity of the gas becomes supersonic within a very short radial distance from the radius at which it begins to increase .",
    "_ effect of inhomogeneities in the flow_.roughly speaking , clumps that form outside the radius where the radial inflow becomes supersonic are dissipated before gas from them reaches the stellar surface , whereas gas from clumps that form near the radius where the flow becomes supersonic falls inward and collides with the stellar surface before the clumps are destroyed . where the streams of denser gas from the clumps orbiting near the sonic point collide with the stellar surface , the streams create arc - shaped areas of brighter x - ray emission that move around the star s equator with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the clumps , which is approximately the keplerian frequency at the sonic point .",
    "_ higher - frequency kilohertz qpo_.the frequency @xmath23 of the higher - frequency of the two kilohertz qpos is approximately equal to the keplerian frequency at the sonic point .",
    "a detectable quasi - periodic oscillation of the x - ray flux and energy spectrum may be produced at this frequency by the periodically changing aspect ( and , for most viewing directions , by the neutron star s periodic eclipse ) of the arc - shaped areas of brighter x - ray emission , as they move around the star with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of clumps in the keplerian disk flow near the sonic point .",
    "the oscillation appears quasi - periodic because the clumps have finite lifetimes and slightly different orbital frequencies .",
    "we find that @xmath24 can be as large as 100 for these oscillations , consistent with the observed coherence of the kilohertz qpos .",
    "the frequency of the sonic - point keplerian qpo is almost independent of the spin rate of the neutron star ( frame - dragging causes the keplerian frequency at the sonic point , and hence the qpo frequency , to depend weakly on the star s spin rate ) .    _",
    "lower - frequency kilohertz qpo_.the frequency @xmath25 of the lower - frequency of the two kilohertz qpos is equal to one ( or possibly two ) times the difference between the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point and the stellar spin frequency .",
    "a qpo may be produced at this beat frequency if the magnetic field of the neutron star is weak enough that a keplerian disk flow penetrates close to the star but strong enough to channel some of the accreting gas before it collides with the stellar surface . for the accretion rates of the z and atoll sources , this requires surface magnetic fields @xmath26 in the range @xmath27  g.    channeling of gas out of the disk generates a qpo at the beat frequency because it creates slightly brighter regions that _ rotate with the star _ ( these slightly brighter regions are distinct from the brighter spots that move around the star at the sonic - point keplerian frequency ) .",
    "the slightly brighter regions that rotate with the star produce a weakly - beamed radiation pattern that rotates at the stellar spin frequency .",
    "the radiation in this pattern produces a slight increase of the azimuthal drag force on the gas in the clumps orbiting near the sonic point , once or twice each beat period ( depending on the symmetry of the slightly brighter region ) .",
    "this oscillation of the drag force in turn creates an oscillation of the inward flux of gas from a given clump at the sonic point once or twice each beat period .",
    "this modulation of the mass flux in the gas streams flowing inward from all clumps orbiting near the sonic point generates a quasi - periodic oscillation of the luminosity and spectrum of the x - ray emission from the stellar surface , with a frequency equal to one ( or possibly two ) times the difference between the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point and the stellar spin frequency .",
    "the difference between the frequencies of the two qpos in a pair is therefore close to ( but not necessarily _ exactly _ equal to ) the stellar spin frequency .    _",
    "oscillation amplitudes_.the amplitudes of theqpos at the sonic - point keplerian frequency and at the beat frequency depend on the strength of the neutron star s magnetic field and the mass accretion rate , and hence one or both of these qpos may sometimes be undetectable .",
    "oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and its overtones are expected to be weak but may sometimes be detectable .",
    "_ similarity of kilohertz qpo frequency behavior in different sources._the similar frequency ranges and the similarity of the frequency - accretion rate correlations of the kilohertz qpos observed in the z and atoll sources  which have accretion rates and magnetic fields that differ by factors of ten or more  is explained by the crucial role of radiation drag , which is only effective within one or two stellar radii , the approximate proportionality of the angular momentum carried by the accreting matter and the radiation drag force , the fact that the stellar magnetic fields as well as the accretion rates are larger in the z sources , and the tendency for the vertical thickness of the disk to increase with increasing mass flux .    the radius where the radiation drag or general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity cause the radial velocity to increase abruptly plays a key role in the model of the kilohertz qpos proposed here .",
    "once the radial velocity begins to increase , the flow becomes supersonic within a very short radial distance ( the inward radial velocity increases",
    "so abruptly that the location of the sonic point is insensitive to the precise definition used ) , so the sonic point is a useful indicator of the point in the disk flow where the radial velocity begins to increase steeply .",
    "hence , for convenience we shall call the point where the radial velocity increases sharply the `` sonic point '' and refer to this model for the kilohertz qpos as the `` sonic - point model '' .",
    "we show that if the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a pair of kilohertz qpos is the orbital frequency of gas in a stable keplerian orbit around the neutron star , as in the sonic - point model proposed here , the frequencies of these qpos provide interesting new upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in the z and atoll sources and new constraints on the equation of state of matter at high densities .",
    "any model of how the kilohertz qpos are produced must be consistent with the known properties of the atoll and z sources .",
    "hence , before analyzing the sonic - point qpo model of the kilohertz qpos in more detail , we first summarize in   2 the previously known x - ray spectral and lower - frequency x - ray variability properties of the atoll and z sources and the physical picture of these sources that has been developed based on these properties . in ",
    "3 we analyze the physics of the sonic - point model and show that it is consistent with the basic properties of the kilohertz qpos . in ",
    "4 we demonstrate that the sonic - point model is also consistent with the existing physical picture of the z and atoll sources and with many of the more detailed properties of the kilohertz qpos . in ",
    "5 we show how to derive upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources from the frequencies of stable keplerian orbits in the kilohertz range and discuss the constraints on the properties of neutron - star matter that follow from these bounds ; the bounds we derive include the effects of frame - dragging . finally , in   6",
    "we discuss several specific predictions of the sonic - point model .",
    "the atoll sources are lmxbs that , over time , trace atoll - shaped patterns in x - ray color - color diagrams ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "they have luminosities @xmath28  , i.e. , 110% of the eddington critical luminosity @xmath29 of a neutron star .",
    "power - density spectra of their brightness variations show broad , band - limited noise components at frequencies below @xmath30  hz .",
    "no qpos with frequencies @xmath31  hz have so far been detected in any of the atoll sources with the exception of 1 , which has a qpo that increases in frequency from 1 to 30  hz as the countrate increases , when the source is very bright ( oosterbroek et al",
    ".  1995 ; shirey et al .  1996 ; bradt , shirey , & levine 1998 ) .",
    "recent comparisons of models of the x - ray emission of neutron stars in lmxbs with the x - ray spectra of atoll sources observed with ( psaltis & lamb 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) suggest that these sources can be subdivided into two groups , the `` 4u '' atoll sources ( such as , , , , and ) and the `` gx '' atoll sources ( such as , , , and ) , based on the strengths of their inferred magnetic fields ; one atoll source , , has intermediate spectral properties and therefore probably has a magnetic field of intermediate strength .",
    "the z sources are lmxbs that produce a characteristic z - shaped track in x - ray color - color diagrams ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "they have luminosities @xmath32  , i.e. , comparable to @xmath29 .",
    "the three branches of the z are called the horizontal , normal , and flaring branches . when a z source is on the horizontal branch , a qpo with a frequency in the range 1560  hz is observed ( van der klis et al 1985 ; van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "this `` horizontal branch oscillation '' ( hbo ) is also detectable in some z sources when they are on the upper part of the normal branch .",
    "the relative width @xmath33 of the hbo peak in power density spectra is typically 0.10.3 and its centroid frequency typically increases with increasing countrate . as a z source moves down the normal branch ,",
    "the hbo becomes weaker and eventually disappears into the noise continuum .",
    "near the middle of the normal branch , a different qpo appears .",
    "the peaks in power density spectra produced by this qpo have relative widths @xmath34 and centroid frequencies in the range 48  hz ( middleditch & priedhorsky 1986 ; van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the properties of this qpo do not vary appreciably on the lower normal branch . as a z source moves from the lower normal branch to the flaring branch , the frequency of this second qpo increases abruptly to @xmath35  hz and the qpo becomes weaker and less coherent , eventually disappearing into the noise ( van der klis 1995 ; dieters & van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "this qpo is the `` normal / flaring branch oscillation '' ( n / fbo ) .",
    "in addition to these two types of quasi - periodic oscillations , power spectra of the brightness variations of the z sources also show three distinct band - limited noise components at frequencies below 200  hz ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the properties of the qpo and noise components vary systematically with the position of a source on its z track ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; see kuulkers 1995 , dieters & van der klis 1997 , and wijnands et al .",
    "1997a for detailed studies of this behavior and possible exceptions ) .",
    "recent analyses of archival data ( kuulkers 1995 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) suggest that the z sources can be subdivided into two groups , based on the morphology of their z tracks and power spectra : the `` cyg - like '' z sources ( 2 , , and ) and the `` sco - like '' z sources ( 1 , , and ) . at a more detailed level , shares some of the characteristics of the `` cyg - like '' sources and therefore probably has intermediate properties ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; wijnands et al .",
    "1997a ) .      the atoll and z sources are neutron stars accreting gas from a keplerian disk fed by a low - mass companion star ( see van der klis 1989 ) . the magnetic fields and the accretion rates of these neutron stars are thought to be the most important parameters that determine their x - ray spectral and temporal characteristics .",
    "according to the most complete and self - consistent current model of these sources , the so - called _ unified model _ ( lamb 1989 , 1991 ) , the atoll sources have dipole magnetic fields @xmath36  g and luminosities 110% of the eddington critical luminosity , whereas the z sources have dipole fields @xmath37  g and luminosities very close to ( and sometimes slightly above ) the eddington critical luminosity .",
    "_ x - ray spectra._the x - ray spectra of the z and atoll sources and the low upper limits on the amplitudes of any periodic variations of their persistent x - ray brightness ( less than 1% in some cases ; see , e.g. , vaughan et al .",
    "1994 ) constrain the properties of these neutron stars .",
    "the low upper limits on brightness variations at their spin frequencies can be understood if the magnetic fields of these neutron stars are @xmath38 g and the magnetospheres and inner disks are surrounded by a central coronae with electron scattering optical depths @xmath39 , even at low accretion rates ( lamb et al.1985 ; lamb 1989 , 1991 ) , because such coronae strongly suppress the x - ray flux oscillation produced by any radiation pattern that rotates with the star ( brainerd & lamb 1987 ) .",
    "this effect is discussed further in   3.6 .",
    "when , as in the z sources , the total luminosity of the neutron star , inner disk , and central corona becomes comparable to @xmath29 , the vertical radiation force drives gas upward , out of the disk and radiation drag removes its angular momentum in less than one orbit , creating a region of approximately radial inflow that extends out to @xmath40  km ( lamb 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "oscillations in this radial flow are thought to be responsible for the n / fbo ( lamb 1989 ; fortner et al .  1989 ; fortner 1992 ; miller & lamb 1992 ) .",
    "detailed physical modeling of the x - ray spectra of the atoll and z sources indicates that soft ( @xmath41  kev ) photons are produced by optically - thick bremsstrahlung and other processes at the surface of the star and by self - absorbed , high - harmonic cyclotron emission in the inner magnetosphere ( psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ; psaltis & lamb 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the accretion rate and the strength of the stellar magnetic field determine whether emission from the stellar surface or cyclotron emission in the magnetosphere is the dominant source of soft photons .",
    "these soft photons are upscattered by electrons in the magnetosphere and the central corona that surrounds the neutron star to produce the x - ray spectrum that emerges from the corona . in the z sources ,",
    "scattering by cooler electrons in the region of approximately radial inflow that surrounds the inner disk and corona further deforms the x - ray spectrum .",
    "cyclotron emission is the dominant source of soft photons if upscattered cyclotron photons are able to supply the full accretion luminosity ( see psaltis et al .",
    "the range of stellar magnetic fields for which cyclotron emission is dominant can be estimated as follows . within the magnetosphere",
    ", the spectrum of self - absorbed cyclotron photons can be approximated by a blackbody spectrum truncated at the energy at which cyclotron emission becomes optically thin .",
    "comptonization within the magnetosphere and central corona increases the energy of a typical photon by a factor @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the compton @xmath44 parameter , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electron temperature and rest mass , @xmath47 is the electron scattering optical depth , and @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 , pp 195223 ) . hence cyclotron emission is the dominant source of soft photons if @xmath49 or , equivalently , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star surface , @xmath52 is the effective radius of the cyclotron photosphere , @xmath53 is the harmonic number at which the transition from optically thick to optically thin emission occurs , and @xmath54 is the radius of the neutron star .",

    "as figure  [ fig : parameterspace ] shows , if the star s magnetic field is and the accretion rate is , the dominant source of photons is the thermal emission from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "these photons are then upscattered by the electrons in the magnetosphere and the central corona .",
    "numerical calculations of the x - ray spectra produced by stars with these field strengths and accretion rates agree well with observations of the spectra of the `` 4u '' atoll sources when they are in the so - called `` banana '' spectral state ( psaltis & lamb 1998c ) .    if instead the star s magnetic field is @xmath56  g and the accretion rate is @xmath57 , cyclotron emission is the dominant source of photons .",

    "some of the accreting gas is likely to couple to the stellar magnetic field beginning at @xmath63 , which will then channel it toward the star s magnetic poles , but some is also likely to continue as a disk flow inside @xmath63 , as a result of rayleigh - taylor instability and incomplete coupling of the flow in the inner disk to the stellar magnetic field ( see , e.g. , scharlemann 1978 ; ghosh & lamb 1979a , 1991 ; lamb 1984 ; spruit & taam 1990 ) . in this case",

    "we have therefore reduced the vertical thickness of the boundary layer in the model so that the keplerian frequency at the radius where the gas couples strongly to the magnetic field agrees quantitatively with the keplerian frequency inferred from spin frequency of 2 , based on the frequencies of its kilohertz qpos ( wijnands et al .",

    "the gas spirals inward in a disk flow in which the radial velocity is supersonic until the gas is channeled by the star s magnetic field or collides with the star s surface .    whether case  1a or 1b applies depends primarily on the strength of the star s magnetic field and on the mass accretion rate .",
    "suppose now that @xmath99",
    ". this will be the case if the equation of state of neutron - star matter is relatively stiff and the star in question has an intermediate - to - low mass or is spinning very rapidly .",
    "there are again two possibilities (   3.2 ) :    ( 2a )  if the radiation drag force is at least moderately strong , gas in the inner disk drifts slowly inward until it reaches the critical radius @xmath81 , where it accelerates rapidly inward .",
    "inside @xmath81 the gas spirals inward in a disk flow in which the radial velocity is supersonic until the gas is channeled by the star s magnetic field or collides with the star s surface .",
    "( 2b )  if instead the radiation drag is weak , gas in the inner disk drifts slowly inward in a disk flow in which the radial velocity is supersonic until the gas is channeled by the star s magnetic field or interacts directly with the star s surface .",
    "again , whether case  2a or 2b applies depends primarily on the strength of the star s magnetic field and on the mass accretion rate .",
    "regardless of whether the slow inward drift of the gas in the disk is terminated by loss of angular momentum to the radiation field or because the gas crosses the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit , the inward radial velocity of the gas increases abruptly at @xmath81 or @xmath94 and becomes supersonic within a very small radial distance . as mentioned in   1 and earlier in this section and described in detail below , the radius where either radiation drag or general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity cause the radial velocity to increase sharply and become supersonic plays a key role in the model of the kilohertz qpos proposed here .",
    "the radius of the sonic point is a useful indicator of the location of this transition .",
    "radiation drag can remove at most only a fraction of the specific angular momentum of the gas and therefore can create a radially supersonic inflow in the inner disk only within a few stellar radii (   3.2 ) .",
    "the reason is that the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbits at radii much larger than the radius of the neutron star is much greater than in orbits just outside the stellar surface , so removal of a small fraction of the angular momentum of the gas at large radii can not cause a large fraction of it to fall to the stellar surface .",
    "in contrast , the specific angular momentum of gas orbiting near the star is not much greater than the angular momentum of gas orbiting at the stellar surface , so radiation drag can cause gas in orbit near the star to plunge to its surface .    radiation drag can cause gas to plunge inward from a radius larger than one would estimate using the newtonian approximation , because ( 1 )  special and general relativistic effects on the gas dynamics and radiation transport significantly increase the fraction of the angular momentum of the accreting gas that can be removed by the radiation and ( 2 )  in general relativity the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbits with radii varies only slowly with @xmath100 .",
    "for this reason , the sonic - point model predicts that if radiation drag produces a transition to rapid radial inflow , the transition will occur within ( for a @xmath101 neutron star ) and hence that the keplerian frequency at the transition radius will be (   3.3 ) .",
    "inside the sonic point , the vertical optical depth of the disk flow falls steeply with decreasing radius , usually to a value small compared to unity .",
    "the optical depth of the disk flow measured radially from the stellar surface to the sonic radius typically also becomes less than unity within a very small radial distance , unless the accretion rate is very high or the geometrical thickness of the disk in the vertical direction is very small .",
    "when the change from `` optically thick '' to `` optically thin '' disk flow is caused by the radiation drag force , the transition is somewhat analogous to the ionization front at the boundary of an hii region . in the disk flow transition",
    ", the photon mean free path becomes longer because the radiation is removing angular momentum and the flow is accelerating inward , causing the density to fall sharply , whereas in an ionization front the radiation is removing bound electrons from atoms and molecules , causing the opacity to fall sharply .",
    "_ generation of the qpo at the sonic - point keplerian frequency_.suppose first that the magnetic field of the neutron star is dynamically negligible .",
    "an element of gas in the disk flow outside the sonic radius diffuses inward subsonically .",
    "when it reaches the sonic radius , it falls supersonically to the stellar surface along a spiral trajectory like that shown in figure  [ fig : spirals]a .",
    "this trajectory was computed in full general relativity for a nonrotating , isotropically emitting star , using the numerical algorithm described in miller & lamb ( 1996 ) .",
    "( the shape of the trajectory depends on the luminosity , spin , and other properties of the source ; the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spirals]a is only illustrative . )",
    "the surface density of the disk flow is much smaller inside the sonic radius than outside because of the sharp increase in the radial velocity at the sonic point .",
    "gas falls inward from the sonic radius and impacts the star all around its equator , producing a bright equatorial ring of x - ray emission .",
    "the flow in the inner part of the accretion disk is expected to have density fluctuations ( `` clumps '' ) produced by a variety of mechanisms , such as thermal instability , kelvin - helmholtz instability , and magnetoturbulence ( see lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; shibazaki & lamb 1987 )",
    ". there may be as many as several hundred such clumps at a given radius in the disk outside the sonic point .",
    "the velocity - independent radially outward component of the radiation force and the velocity - dependent radiation drag force both tend to cause gas in the shadow of a clump to overtake the clump in azimuth and radius , and hence the radiation force tends to increase clumping .    as discussed in   3.4 , a clump that forms outside the sonic radius is dissipated by gas pressure forces , turbulence , and the shear in the velocity field before the gas from it can reach the stellar surface ,",
    "so such clumps do not produce significant inhomogeneities in the inflow from the sonic radius .",
    "in contrast , a clump that forms near the sonic radius can persist for up to @xmath102 times the infall time to the stellar surface , so such a clump generates a stream of denser infalling gas from the sonic point to the stellar surface that lasts as long as the clump survives .",
    "the shape of the pattern formed by the denser gas falling inward from a clump depends on how the angular velocity of the infalling gas varies with radius .",
    "for example , if the angular velocity of the gas were independent of radius , the pattern of higher gas density would be a straight , radial line from the clump to the stellar surface .",
    "in general , the pattern formed by the denser gas from a clump is a fairly open curve .",
    "the shape of the pattern , like the trajectories that produce it , depends on the luminosity , spin , and other properties of the source .",
    "figure  [ fig : spirals]b shows the pattern formed by inflow of gas along spiral trajectories with the shape shown in figure  [ fig : spirals]a . in this example",
    "the pattern of denser gas is also a spiral .",
    "it is more open than the spiral trajectories of the individual elements of denser gas that produce it , because the source of the denser gas ( the clump ) orbits the star only slightly slower than the infalling gas .",
    "we expect the time - averaged radiation field around the star to be nearly axisymmetric .",
    "moreover , the gas from a given clump typically orbits the star @xmath103 times before colliding with the stellar surface , so the effects of any azimuthal variations in the radiation drag force are averaged out .",
    "therefore , the spiral pattern of denser gas produced by the inflow from a given clump rotates nearly uniformly around the star with a rotation frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the clump that is producing it , which is the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point .",
    "the time evolution that generates an x - ray oscillation at the sonic - point keplerian frequency is illustrated by the four panels of figure  [ fig : keplerqpo ] . in this figure a single clump is shown advancing in its orbit by 90  from one panel to the next .",
    "the pattern of higher density gas rotates uniformly around the star with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the clump , so it also advances by 90  from one panel to the next .",
    "where the denser gas from a clump collides with the stellar surface , it produces an arc - shaped area of brighter x - ray emission .",
    "this arc - shaped brighter `` footprint '' moves around the star s equator with a frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the pattern , which is the orbital frequency of the clump and is therefore approximately equal to the keplerian frequency @xmath104 at the sonic point . in reality",
    ", many clumps are crossing the sonic radius at any given time , and hence there are many bright footprints moving around the star s equator .",
    "the radiation from these footprints carries the kinetic energy of infall that is released when the gas that has fallen inward from the clumps at the sonic radius collides with the stellar surface .    as seen by a distant observer",
    "whose line of sight is inclined with respect to the orbital axis of the disk , the aspect presented by a given bright footprint varies periodically and the footprint is eclipsed with a frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the pattern , which is approximately the keplerian orbital frequency at the sonic point .",
    "footprints come and go as clumps form near the sonic point and then dissipate .",
    "also , the orbital frequencies of the clumps that are producing footprints at any given time differ slightly . as a result , a distant observer sees a strong , _ quasi - periodic _ oscillation of the x - ray flux and spectrum at the pattern rotation frequency , which is close to @xmath104 .",
    "_ this is the the sonic - point keplerian - frequency qpo_.    the spin of the neutron star is not involved in generating the sonic - point keplerian frequency qpo .",
    "the precise frequency of the sonic - point keplerian qpo does depend weakly on the spin frequency of the neutron star , because the frame - dragging caused by the star s spin has a small effect on the frequencies of keplerian orbits near the neutron star .",
    "the sonic - point keplerian frequency qpo mechanism described here , which generates a qpo with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency at the sonic point , differs fundamentally from the suggestion of paczynski ( 1987 ) , who speculated that when the sonic point is located at the radius of the marginally stable orbit , a qpo might be produced by unsteady flow through it with a low ( @xmath105 ) frequency that would have nothing directly to do with the orbital frequency of the marginally stable orbit .    _",
    "generation of the qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency_.suppose now that the magnetic field of the neutron star is weak enough that a prograde keplerian disk flow penetrates near the surface of the star but strong enough that close to the star some of the gas is channeled by the field .",
    "the channeled gas produces slightly brighter spots where it collides with the stellar surface .",
    "if these slightly brighter spots are offset from the star s spin axis , the enhanced radiation from them generates a beamed pattern of radiation that rotates with the star .",
    "this rotating radiation pattern creates a periodic oscillation in the radiation force that is acting on the clumps of gas crossing the sonic radius .",
    "hence , if conditions near the star are such that the nearly keplerian motion of the gas in the clumps orbiting near the sonic radius is terminated by loss of angular momentum to the radiation , the inward flux of mass from the clumps near the sonic radius will increase once or twice each beat period , depending on the symmetry of the radiation pattern that rotates with the star .    as a specific",
    "example , suppose that the radiation drag force experienced by the gas in a given clump orbiting near the sonic radius peaks each time the beam of radiation that rotates with the star sweeps across the clump . this will occur with a frequency equal to one or two times the difference between the orbital frequency of the clump , which is the keplerian orbital frequency near the sonic point , and the spin frequency @xmath83 of the neutron star .",
    "_ we call @xmath106 the sonic - point beat frequency and denote it @xmath107_. if the transition to supersonic inflow is caused by radiation drag , the oscillation of the radiation drag force will cause the supersonic inflow of gas from the clumps orbiting near the sonic point to oscillate quasi - periodically with a frequency equal to one or two times the sonic - point beat frequency .",
    "the time evolution that produces this oscillation is shown schematically in the six snapshots of figure  [ fig : beatqpo ] .",
    "for clarity , only a single clump is shown orbiting at the sonic radius and the six snapshots show the sequence of events as seen in a frame corotating with the star .",
    "in panel  ( a ) the clump is in the beam of radiation that rotates with the star and hence the inward flux of denser gas from the clump is greater than average . in panel",
    "( b ) the clump has moved out of the beam and hence the inward flux of gas from the clump is smaller than average ; the pulse of gas that was dragged off the clump by the stronger radiation flux in frame  ( a ) is now falling inward from the clump . in panel",
    "( c ) the clump has moved ahead of the beam by 180 ; the inward flux of gas from the clump remains smaller than average and the pulse of denser gas that began to fall inward in frame  ( a ) is further away from the clump . in panel",

    "( f ) the clump has again moved ahead of the beam by 90  and the inward flux of gas from the clump is again smaller than average ; the pulse of denser gas that began to fall inward in frame  ( a ) is now colliding with the stellar surface , producing a brighter beam of radiation from the footprint of the stream .",
    "in reality , the radiation drag force , and hence the inward mass flux from a clump , may be greatest not when the clump is fully illuminated by the beam that rotates with the star , as assumed in this illustration , but at some other relative phase , because the radiation drag force depends in a complicated way on the various components of the radiation stress - energy tensor ( see miller & lamb 1996 ) . in any case , the inward mass flux from the orbiting clumps oscillates quasi - periodically with a frequency approximately equal to the sonic - point beat frequency @xmath108 , producing a quasi - periodic oscillation in the luminosity and spectrum of the x - ray emission from the stellar surface .",
    "_ this is the sonic - point beat - frequency qpo_.    _ properties of the sonic - point qpos_.in   3.3 we show that the sonic - point mechanism naturally generates keplerian - frequency qpos with frequencies @xmath109  hz for a wide range of stellar magnetic fields and accretion rates and that it is natural for the frequencies of the sonic - point keplerian and beat - frequency qpos to increase steeply with increasing mass flux through the inner disk .",
    "the angular distribution of the emission from each emitting point within a footprint at the stellar surface is broad , so the power at @xmath104 is likely to be much greater than the power at overtones of @xmath104 .",
    "the modulation of the inflow from clumps orbiting at the sonic radius is unlikely to be perfectly sinusoidal , so overtones of the sonic - point beat frequency @xmath107 as well as @xmath107 itself may be detectable .    in   3.4 we argue that the sonic - point mechanism can produce qpos with @xmath24 ratios as large as @xmath102 , i.e. , similar to those observed in the atoll and z sources .",
    "the oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency is generated by the beating of the stellar spin frequency , which is periodic , against the quasi - periodic sonic - point keplerian frequency oscillation .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect the @xmath24 values of the oscillations in a pair to be roughly similar , in the absence of other disturbing effects . in   3.5",
    "we show that the steep increase in qpo amplitude with photon energy observed in many kilohertz qpos is understandable in the sonic - point model .",
    "the visibilities of the various qpos generated by the sonic - point mechanism depend on the mass flux in the keplerian disk flow that penetrates to the sonic point , the number and distribution of clumps in the disk at the sonic point , the brightness of the footprints produced by the streams from the clumps relative to the brightness of the rest of the stellar surface , the geometry and optical depth of the scattering material around the star , and the inclination of the system .",
    "if radiation forces are required to produce large clumps with substantial density contrasts , the amplitudes of the qpos at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies are likely to become much smaller and may become undetectable once the angular momentum loss radius @xmath110 has retreated inward to the radius @xmath98 of the innermost stable circular orbit , because once this has happened , the gas in the disk near the sonic point is increasingly shielded from radiation coming from the stellar surface by gas in the disk closer to the star . however , if large clumps with substantial density contrasts are formed by other mechanisms , the sonic - point keplerian frequency qpo may still be detectable if the sonic point is at @xmath94 , even if the sonic - point beat frequency qpo  which can only be generated if radiation forces have a significant dynamical effect at the sonic radius  has disappeared .    in   3.6",
    "we show that scattering by the electrons in the central corona that surrounds the neutron stars in the z and atoll sources strongly attenuates the already intrinsically weak beaming oscillation at the stellar spin frequency as well as the weak beaming oscillations at other frequencies , making all but the strongest beaming oscillation ",
    "the one at the sonic - point keplerian frequency  difficult to detect with current instruments .",
    "in contrast , scattering only weakly attenuates luminosity oscillations , so the luminosity oscillations at the sonic - point beat frequency and its overtones are likely to be detectable . taking into account both the generation of these various oscillations and their attenuation in the circumstellar environment , keplerian - frequency and beat - frequency qpos with rms amplitudes as large as 15% appear possible .    as discussed in   2 , the z sources appear to have significantly stronger magnetic fields than the atoll sources .",
    "the magnetic fields of the z sources are therefore likely to channel a larger fraction of the accreting gas out of the disk plane before it penetrates close to the stellar surface , so we expect the amplitudes of the kilohertz qpos to be smaller in the z sources than in the atoll sources",
    ". the magnetic field of the neutron star in some atoll sources may be so weak that the qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency is undetectable , even though a qpo at the sonic - point keplerian frequency is visible .",
    "the sonic - point beat frequency may also be undetectable at some times if the scattering optical depth between the stellar surface and the sonic point is too large .",
    "in other sources or at other times , the luminosity oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency may be detectable even though the beaming oscillation at the sonic - point keplerian frequency has been suppressed by scattering in the corona surrounding the star .      in both the atoll and the z sources , we expect radiation drag to cause gas in the keplerian disk flow to make an abrupt transition from slow inward drift to rapid radial inflow several kilometers above the surface of the neutron star .",
    "this transition occurs at the radius where the drag exerted by radiation from the star removes enough angular momentum from the gas quickly enough that it falls to the surface of the star unimpeded by a significant centrifugal barrier .",
    "we first describe the consequences of the transfer of angular momentum from the gas in the inner disk to the radiation and then present a fully general relativistic calculation of the gas dynamics and radiation transport in the inner disk that shows the nature of this transition in the atoll sources , which have luminosities much less than the eddington critical luminosity .",
    "we next give approximate analytical expressions for the location and width of this transition , then discuss why the nature and location of the transition may be similar in the z sources even though their accretion rates and luminosities are much higher than the accretion rates and luminosities of the atoll sources , and finally summarize the implications for the sonic - point qpos .",
    "_ transfer of angular momentum to the radiation field_.the azimuthal drag force exerted by radiation from the star can create a radially supersonic inflow in the inner disk . however , this is possible only within a few stellar radii if the luminosity of the star is produced by accretion and most of the accreting gas flows through the inner disk .",
    "the reason is that radiation drag can remove at most a fraction of the specific angular momentum of the accreting gas ( see fortner et al .",
    "1989 ; for more detailed discussions , see miller & lamb 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbits at radii large compared to the radius @xmath54 of the neutron star is much larger than at @xmath54 , so radiation drag can not cause more than @xmath102030% of the gas at such large radii to fall to the stellar surface . in contrast , the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbits very near the star is not much larger than the angular momentum of orbits at the stellar surface , so radiation drag can cause gas in keplerian orbits near the star to plunge to the surface .",
    "radiation drag can create a radially supersonic inflow at a larger radius than one would estimate using the newtonian approximation , because special and general relativistic effects significantly increase the fraction of the angular momentum of the accreting gas that is transferred to the radiation ( miller & lamb 1993 ) . also , in general relativity the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbits with radii varies only slowly with radius .",
    "the latter point is illustrated by figure  [ fig : angmomvsradius ] , which shows the specific angular momentum of gas in circular keplerian orbit around a nonrotating and a slowly rotating @xmath101 neutron star , as a function of the radius of the orbit .",
    "the specific angular momentum varies fairly steeply at , but only slowly with radius between and .",
    "for example , the specific angular momentum of circular orbits changes by less than @xmath111% from ( 25  km ) to ( 12  km ) .",
    "these curves are of course physically meaningful only at radii greater than the radius @xmath54 of the neutron star .",
    "the relatively flat shape of the angular momentum curve for circular orbits near a neutron star means that if gas orbiting there loses even @xmath86% of its angular momentum , it will plunge to the stellar surface .",
    "we can estimate the outer boundary of the region where radiation coming from near the stellar surface can remove sufficient angular momentum from the gas orbiting in the disk so that it falls supersonically to the stellar surface by comparing @xmath112 , the largest fraction of angular momentum that can be removed by radiation coming from the surface of the neutron star , with @xmath113 , the fraction of the specific angular momentum of gas in a circular keplerian orbit at radius @xmath100 that must be removed in order for the gas to fall from @xmath100 to @xmath94 ( if the radius of the star is less than @xmath94 , gas that has reached @xmath94 can fall to the stellar surface without losing any more angular momentum ) .",
    "these two quantities are compared in figure  [ fig : angmomfractionvsradius ] .",
    "here @xmath112 was computed by assuming that the gravitational binding energy at the stellar surface is converted into radiation there , taking into account the relevant angular , special relativistic , and general relativistic factors ( see miller & lamb  1996 ) , and assuming that all of the radiation emitted in the direction of the disk interacts with the disk flow ( @xmath114 in the notation of miller & lamb  [ 1993 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : angmomfractionvsradius ] shows that @xmath112 exceeds @xmath113 only inside ( ) . this characteristic radius depends on the radius of the neutron star , because the luminosity is proportional to the gravitational binding energy at the stellar surface , but this dependence is relatively weak ( the characteristic radius decreases from @xmath115 to @xmath116 as the stellar radius increases from @xmath117 to @xmath118 ) .",
    "hence , _ the sonic - point model predicts that if radiation drag produces a transition to rapid radial inflow , the transition will occur within and hence that the keplerian frequency at the transition radius will be _ ( see   3.3 ) . determining the actual radius of the transition requires gas dynamical and radiation transport calculations .",

    "the differential radial distance in the local static frame is in turn related to the differential radial distance @xmath145 in the global ( boyer - lindquist ) coordinate system by @xmath146 , so @xmath147 .    once the drag force exerted by the radiation from the stellar surface begins to remove angular momentum from the gas in the keplerian disk , centrifugal support",
    "is lost and the gas falls inward , accelerating rapidly .",
    "radiation that comes from near the star and is scattered by the gas in the disk is generally scattered out of the disk plane and hence does not interact further with the gas in the disk . moreover ,",
    "second and successive scatterings do not contribute proportionately to the azimuthal radiation drag force on the gas because the radiation field is aberrated by the first scattering and afterward carries angular momentum ( see miller & lamb 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore treat the interaction of the radiation with the gas in the disk by assuming that the intensity of the radiation coming from the star is attenuated as it passes through the gas in the disk , diminishing as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is given by equation  ( [ eq : radialopticaldepth ] ) , and that scattered radiation does not contribute to removal of angular momentum from the gas . in calculating the radiation drag force ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that the differential scattering cross section is isotropic in the frame comoving with the accreting gas ( this gives results very close to those using a thomson differential cross section ; see lamb & miller 1995 ) . the radiation field and the motion of the gas",
    "are computed in full general relativity .",
    "the optical depth of the disk flow near the star is generally much less than one would estimate by calculating it without taking into account the radiation forces .",
    "the reason is that the loss of centrifugal support caused by transfer of angular momentum to the radiation causes the inward radial velocity of the gas in the disk at radii less than the radius @xmath81 of the radiation - induced transition to supersonic inflow to be orders of magnitude higher , and the density of the gas to be orders of magnitude lower , than if radiation forces were neglected ( see miller & lamb 1996 ) .",
    "hence the mean free path in the disk flow is much larger , and the optical depth from the stellar surface to a given radius in the flow is much smaller , than they would be in the absence of radiation drag . in this way",
    "the radiation increases the transparency of the disk flow , so its effects are felt much farther out in the flow than one would estimate from the properties of the undisturbed flow .",

    "it is this departure from keplerian orbital motion , and the associated loss of centrifugal support , that causes the flow to accelerate radially inward .",
    "all the angular velocity profiles turn downward near the stellar surface because of the strong azimuthal radiation drag force there .",
    "the decrease in the kinetic energy and angular momentum of the inflowing gas is exactly compensated by the increase in the energy and angular momentum carried outward by the escaping radiation ( see miller & lamb 1993 , 1996 ) .",

    "this transition is somewhat analogous to the transition at the boundary of a strmgren sphere , except that here the radiation removes angular momentum from the gas rather than stripping electrons from atoms or molecules and causes a sharp increase in the inward radial velocity rather than in the degree of ionization .",

    "hence the orbital frequency at the sonic radius , and therefore the frequency of the associated qpo , increases steeply with increasing mass flux .",
    "if instead conditions are such that radiation forces do not terminate the keplerian flow , the keplerian flow is probably terminated by interaction with the stellar surface , in which case generation of a coherent qpo with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency at the stellar surface appears very unlikely",

    "hence , under these conditions the frequency of any qpo with the orbital frequency at the sonic point will be approximately independent of the accretion rate .",
    "although the numerical results presented here are for accretion rates typical of the atoll sources , which have very weak magnetic fields and are accreting at rates much less than the eddington critical rate , we expect the structure of the accretion flow and the behavior of the sonic - point keplerian qpo frequency to be similar in the z sources , even though they are thought to have stronger magnetic fields and are accreting at much higher rates .",
    "there are three reasons .",
    "( 1 )  the radius of the transition to rapid radial inflow that we are considering is necessarily close to the neutron star whatever the luminosity , because the fraction of the angular momentum in the keplerian disk flow that can be removed by radiation drag is small and general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity are important only near the neutron star .",
    "( although the luminosities of the z sources are much higher , the angular momentum flux that must be removed to create a radial inflow is correspondingly higher . in sources with luminosities very close to the eddington critical luminosity",
    ", radiation drag can significantly affect the motion of up to of the accreting gas further away , but can only affect the motion of most of the accreting gas close to the star [ see fortner et al .",
    "1989 ; lamb 1989 ] . )",
    "( 2 )  the inferred magnetic fields of the neutron stars in the z sources are stronger than those of the neutron stars in the atoll sources , and hence a larger fraction of the disk flow is likely to be channeled out of the disk by the stellar magnetic field , causing the mass flux through the inner disks of the z sources to be comparable to the mass fluxes through the inner disks of the atoll sources .",
    "( 3 )  the vertical thickness of the inner disk flow is likely to be larger in the z sources than in the atoll sources .",
    "all of these effects act in the direction of making the radius of angular momentum loss in the z sources similar to its value in the atoll sources .",
    "we do expect significant departures from the behavior found in the present calculations when the luminosity equals or exceeds the eddington critical luminosity .",
    "these points are discussed in more detail in   4 .",
    "we consider now the frequencies that are generated by the sonic - point mechanism .",

    "qpos at sideband frequencies and oscillations at the spin frequency of the neutron star and its overtones are likely to be very weak .    in analyzing the frequencies generated by the sonic - point mechanism , we shall for definiteness use boyer - lindquist global coordinates , which are familiar because they are commonly used to describe the spacetime of rotating black holes .",

    "clumps orbiting at different distances above or below the midplane of the disk will generally also have slightly different orbital frequencies .",

    "the relative amplitude of the oscillation will increase monotonically with increasing photon energy , for energies less than @xmath257  kev , but will become independent of photon energy for energies greater than @xmath258 .",
    "we expect this to be the case for the oscillation at the sonic - point keplerian frequency , which is mainly a beaming oscillation ( see   3.1 ) and hence involves a relatively small variation in the photon production rate .",
    "_ we therefore expect the relative amplitude of the keplerian - frequency qpo to increase steeply in the @xmath256 energy range and then flatten at high energies_.    when the photon injection rate and spectrum of injected soft photons do not change appreciably during a qpo cycle , the amplitude of the oscillation in luminosity caused by the oscillation in optical depth is comparable to the amplitude of the optical depth oscillation and is given by @xmath259 equations  ( [ eq : ampkepler ] ) and ( [ eq : lumosc ] ) demonstrate that _ a relatively weak oscillation in optical depth of only a few percent that is accompanied by a luminosity oscillation of moderate amplitude can produce naturally a much larger oscillation in the countrate at high photon energies_.    equation ( [ eq : ampkepler ] ) also shows that the relative amplitude of the oscillation at a given photon energy is different for different electron temperatures and optical depths , unless the relative amplitude of the oscillation in optical depth @xmath250 varies in such a way as to compensate for this effect . we therefore expect that as the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star changes ( on timescales much longer than a beat - frequency period ) , the electron temperature and optical depth in the comptonizing region will change , causing the photon - energy dependence of the beat - frequency and keplerian - frequency oscillation amplitudes to change .",

    "we emphasize that , for a variety of reasons , equation  ( [ eq : timelag ] ) gives only an upper bound to the expected time lag at photon energies @xmath271 .",
    "first , this equation assumes that all photons are injected at the center of a spherical medium .",
    "however , if most of the photons are produced near the surface of the neutron star and escape a few kilometers above it , the time lag can be significantly smaller .",

    "if instead most of the optical depth is concentrated near the center of the corona , this will also reduce significantly the average escape time .    _ in summary , to the extent that the effects of comptonization dominate , we expect the sonic - point keplerian- and beat - frequency oscillations at high photon energies should lag the corresponding oscillations at lower photon energies and the time lag between a few kev and @xmath13  kev should be a fraction of a millisecond _",

    "scattering generally attenuates beaming oscillations much more than luminosity oscillations , for the conditions relevant to lmxbs ( lamb 1988 ) .",
    "the reason is that an anisotropic radiation pattern becomes approximately isotropic after only a few scatterings , whereas a luminosity oscillation is attenuated by scattering only if the time required for photons to escape from the scattering region is much larger than the period of the oscillation , which requires a large optical depth for the oscillation frequencies and coronal dimensions of interest to us .",

    "in contrast , the oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency , which is the only luminosity oscillation produced by the flow , should be strong enough to be observed even if its amplitude at the neutron star surface is moderate . as a result",

    "in this section we describe the observational implications of the sonic - point model and compare them with observations of the kilohertz qpos .",
    "we first list the important properties of these qpos that any model must explain .",
    "these properties are ( see   1 ) : ( 1 )  high ( 3001200  hz ) frequencies , which can vary by several hundred hertz in a few hundred seconds ( see wijnands et al .  1998 and van der klis 1995 ) ; ( 2 )  similar frequency ranges in stars with significantly different magnetic field strengths and accretion rates ; ( 3 )  relatively high coherence ( @xmath283 up to @xmath102 ) ; ( 4 )  260  kev rms amplitudes @xmath14% in the z sources but much higher ( up to 15% ) in the atoll sources ; ( 5 )  the common occurrence of two ( but never more than two ) simultaneous kilohertz qpos in a given source ; ( 6 )  a frequency separation @xmath6 between the two kilohertz qpos that is approximately constant in a given source ; ( 7 )  approximate consistency of @xmath6 with the stellar spin frequency inferred from burst oscillations ; ( 8)  the similarity of most atoll and z source spin frequencies ; ( 9 )  the frequently similar fwhm of the two qpo peaks seen simultaneously ; ( 10 )  the increase of the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos with increasing inferred accretion rate that is observed in many sources ; and ( 11 )  a steep increase in the amplitude of the higher - frequency of the two kilohertz qpos with increasing photon energy in the 215  kev energy band in many sources .    in   4.1 we show that the stellar magnetic field strengths and electron scattering optical depths required for the sonic - point mechanism to operate are consistent with the stellar magnetic field strengths and optical depths of the compact central corona inferred from previous modeling of the x - ray spectra and @xmath284  hz x - ray variability of the atoll and z sources . in   4.2 we compare the kilohertz qpo and neutron star spin frequencies expected in the sonic - point model with the kilohertz qpo and neutron star spin frequencies observed in the atoll and z sources .",
    "we also discuss the expected and observed dependence of the qpo frequencies on accretion rate . in ",
    "4.3 describe the amplitude and coherence of the various qpos expected in the sonic - point model , comparing them with the observed amplitudes and coherence of the kilohertz qpos .",
    "in particular , we show that the sonic - point model explains naturally why at most two kilohertz qpos have been detected in the power spectrum of each source .",
    "we also discuss the relative coherence of qpos at different frequencies and the expected dependence of qpo amplitudes on accretion rate and photon energy . in   4.4 we describe the inverse correlation between qpo amplitude and stellar magnetic field expected in the sonic - point model and show that there is already substantial evidence for such a correlation .",
    "the operation of the sonic - point mechanism for producing strong , coherent kilohertz qpos requires that a number of conditions be satisfied :    ( 1 )  in order to produce the higher - frequency kilohertz qpos with the large amplitudes observed in some sources , the neutron star magnetic fields in these sources must be relatively weak , so that a substantial fraction of the accreting gas penetrates close to the star in a keplerian disk flow (   3.1 ) .",
    "( 2 )  in order to produce the lower - frequency kilohertz qpos , the neutron star magnetic field , although relatively weak , must be strong enough to channel some of the accreting gas near the stellar surface to produce bright spots that rotate with the star and modulate the accretion rate at the sonic - point beat frequency (   3.1 ) .",
    "( 3 )  in order to generate qpos with the high coherence observed in most sources , the disk flow at the sonic point must be geometrically thin (   3.4 ) .",
    "( 4 )  in order that only the qpos at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies be detectable and that x - ray oscillations at the stellar spin frequency be very weak or undetectable at present sensitivities , electron scattering in the central corona must help to attenuate the weak beaming oscillations at other frequencies and at the stellar spin frequency .",
    "the central corona must therefore have an electron scattering optical depth @xmath285 (   3.6 ) .",
    "as we now explain briefly , all of these conditions follow naturally from the unified model of weak - field accreting neutron stars described in ",
    "2.2 .    the magnetic field strengths in the 4u atoll sources are thought to be low enough ( @xmath286  g ) that at their inferred accretion rates ( @xmath287@xmath288 ) the cylindrical radius @xmath63 at which the keplerian disk flow couples strongly to the stellar magnetic field is @xmath289  cm",
    ". the magnetic field strengths of the neutron stars in the z sources are thought to be a few times larger than in the 4u atoll sources , but the accretion rates are much larger as well , so @xmath63 is comparable to its value in the atoll sources .",
    "thus , in both the 4u atoll sources and the z sources , the gas in the keplerian disk penetrates close to the star before any of it couples strongly to the stellar magnetic field .",
    "we therefore expect that a significant fraction of the accreting gas will remain in a keplerian disk flow down to the sonic point and will continue in a disk flow very close to the stellar surface , as required in the sonic - point model .",
    "evidence that the magnetic fields of neutron stars in lmxbs , while typically weak , are nevertheless strong enough in many sources to channel the flow near the star and hence to produce a qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency comes from power spectra constructed from observations of ( van der klis et al.1996e ) , 1 ( van der klis 1996a , 1996b , 1996d , 1997b ) , ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997c ) , and ( wijnands et al .",
    "in addition to two simultaneous kilohertz qpos , these power spectra show horizontal branch oscillations , which appear to be magnetospheric beat - frequency oscillations ( see   2 and psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "these power spectra indicate that in the z sources , some of the gas in the disk couples strongly to the weak stellar magnetic field at two or three stellar radii and is funneled into hot spots that could modulate the mass flux from the sonic point at the sonic - point beat frequency by periodically irradiating the clumps at the sonic radius ( see   2 ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the magnetic fields of many of the atoll sources are only a little weaker than those in the z sources and are therefore still strong enough to produce a qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency .",
    "this expectation is supported by the spectral modeling described in   2.2 .",
    "accretion via a geometrically - thin keplerian disk flow , which is required to explain the high coherence of the kilohertz qpos , is expected in the atoll sources , because at their low accretion rates the inner part of the accretion disk is likely to be gas - pressure - dominated . in the z sources , which are thought to be accreting at close to the eddington critical rate , gas in the keplerian disk flow that is not channeled by the stellar magnetic field is likely to be pinched by the stellar field into a geometrically thin disk .",
    "the final requirement listed above for the sonic - point model , namely that the optical depth of the hot central corona exceed @xmath290 , follows directly from the spectral modeling discussed in   2.2 .    in summary ,",
    "the physical picture of the atoll and z sources that was developed prior to the discovery of the kilohertz qpos , based on their 220  kev x - ray spectra and 1100  hz x - ray variability , give the magnetic field strengths , accretion flows , and electron scattering optical depths required by the sonic - point model .      in the sonic - point model ,",
    "the frequency of the higher - frequency kilohertz qpo ( when two are present ) is the keplerian orbital frequency @xmath104 at the point in the disk flow where the inward radial velocity increases rapidly within a small radial distance , whereas the frequency of the lower - frequency kilohertz qpo is approximately the difference between @xmath104 and the stellar spin frequency @xmath83 . in this section",
    "we describe the range of sonic - point keplerian and neutron star spin frequencies and the variation of the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies with accretion rate expected in the model and then compare these expectations with the observations .",
    "we discuss the expected amplitudes of oscillations at other frequencies in   4.3 .",
    "_ similarity of the sonic - point keplerian qpo frequencies in different sources_.a key question is why the higher - frequency kilohertz qpos in different sources always have frequencies between @xmath0500  hz and , even though the neutron stars in these sources have time - averaged mass accretion rates that differ by more than a factor of 100 and magnetic fields that are thought to differ by more than a factor of 10 . in the sonic - point model",
    "there are three main reasons why the keplerian - frequency qpo is restricted to this frequency range :    \\(1 ) as discussed in   3.2 , there is an upper bound on the radius @xmath291 of the sonic point , which is set by the maximum fraction of the angular momentum of the accreting gas that can be removed by radiation from the stellar surface and is @xmath292 , where @xmath98 is the radius of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "there is also a lower bound on @xmath221 , which is @xmath94 if the radius @xmath54 of the neutron star is smaller than @xmath94 , or @xmath54 otherwise .",
    "hence , the keplerian frequency at the sonic point is confined to a similar interval in the atoll and z sources , regardless of their accretion rates and magnetic field strengths . as a result ,",
    "if the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources have typically accreted a few tenths of a solar mass and therefore have masses @xmath293 , these constraints on the sonic - point keplerian frequency mean that the frequencies of their sonic - point keplerian qpos will fall between @xmath0400  hz and @xmath01300  hz .",
    "\\(2 ) modeling of the 2 - 20  kev x - ray spectra and 1100  hz power spectra of the atoll and z sources indicates that the magnetic fields of these neutron stars are positively correlated with their time - averaged accretion rates , i.e. , sources with higher accretion rates appear to have stronger magnetic fields ( see   2.2 and psaltis & lamb 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) .",
    "this has an important implication for the frequency range of the kilohertz qpos , because the stronger the stellar magnetic field , the _ larger _ the fraction of the gas in the disk that is likely to couple to the magnetic field at two or three stellar radii and be channeled out of the disk flow there . as a result ,",
    "the stronger the magnetic field , the _ smaller _ the mass flux @xmath294 through the disk at the sonic point .",
    "hence , @xmath294 differs by a much smaller factor in the z and atoll sources than does the total mass flux @xmath295 onto the neutron star .",
    "the sonic - point keplerian frequency @xmath104 is governed more by @xmath296 than by @xmath295 , so the positive correlation between magnetic field and accretion rate means that the frequency ranges of the sonic - point qpos are likely to be more similar in a collection of neutron - star lmxbs than one would expect , based only on the different ranges of @xmath295 in different systems .",
    "( 3 )  in addition , the inner disk is expected to be thicker if @xmath297 is large . as a result ,",
    "the radial optical depth through the disk at a given accretion rate is smaller , which allows radiation from the neutron star surface to penetrate further out into the disk than one would expect based only on the different values of @xmath295 in the different systems .",
    "this tendency also acts to make the range of sonic - point radii , and hence the frequency ranges of the keplerian - frequency qpos , more similar in different systems than consideration of the accretion rates alone would suggest ( see   3.2 ) .    _",
    "expected and inferred neutron star spin rates_.in the sonic - point model , the separation between the frequencies of the qpos in a pair is approximately equal to the stellar spin frequency .",
    "the frequency separations observed in the kilohertz qpo sources so far ( see table  [ table : spinfrequencies ] ) all indicate spin rates of a few hundred hertz , consistent with the spin rates expected in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo ( see   2 , lamb et al .",
    "1985 , and ghosh & lamb 1992 ) .",
    "oscillations have been observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts from five kilohertz qpo sources so far ( again see table  [ table : spinfrequencies ] ) .",
    "only a single oscillation has been observed from each source during a given burst , the oscillations in the tails of bursts appear to be highly coherent ( see , e.g. , smith et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the frequencies are always the same in a given source . furthermore , comparison of burst oscillations from over about a year shows that the timescale for any variation in the oscillation frequency is @xmath298  yr ( see , e.g. , strohmayer 1997 ) .",
    "the burst oscillations are thought to be caused by emission from one or two regions of brighter x - ray emission on the stellar surface ( see strohmayer et al .",
    "1997b ) , producing oscillations at the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone , respectively .",
    "the 363  hz frequency of the burst oscillation observed in is consistent with the separation frequency of its two simultaneous kilohertz qpos .",
    "the 524  hz and 581  hz frequencies of the burst oscillations seen in and are probably twice the spin frequencies of these neutron stars ( see morgan & smith 1996 ; smith et al .",
    "1997 ; wijnands & van der klis 1997 ; zhang et al .  1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "if so , the spin rates of these stars are 262  hz and 290  hz , respectively",
    ". the frequencies of the fairly coherent oscillations seen at 549  hz in 1 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) and at 589  hz in the so - far - unidentified source near the galactic center ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996d ) may also be twice the spin frequencies of these neutron stars .",
    "these spin rates are all consistent with those expected in the sonic - point model",
    ".    _ similarity of the neutron - star spin frequencies in different sources_.if the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources have spin frequencies comparable to their equilibrium spin frequencies , then we expect their spin frequencies to be a few hundred hertz . this can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : mukepler ] ) in   2.2 , which can be solved for the equilibrium spin frequencies at which continued accretion at the given rate leaves the spin frequency unchanged , with the result @xmath299 here @xmath300 is the critical fastness ( ghosh & lamb 1979b ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath301 , a @xmath302 atoll source with @xmath303 accreting from a gpd disk at a rate @xmath304 has an equilibrium spin frequency of 230  hz , which is similar to the 240  hz equilibrium spin frequency of a @xmath101 z source with @xmath305 accreting from an rpd disk at a rate @xmath306 .    a recent analysis ( psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ) of the properties of the hbos and kilohertz qpos in a collection of five z sources shows that they are consistent with many of the predictions of the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo and that the agreement is best if , as expected in this model , they are all in spin equilibrium ( see also ghosh & lamb 1992 ) . in particular , this analysis shows that _ the narrow range of spin frequencies observed in the z sources is to be expected if they are in spin equilibrium_.    _ variation of kilohertz qpo frequencies with mass accretion rate_.in the sonic - point model , the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos are expected to rise as the accretion rate increases , within the bounds set by the orbital frequencies at the angular momentum loss radius and at the radius of the marginally stable orbit ( see above and   3.2 ) . in order to see why an increase is expected , suppose that the sonic radius is at @xmath307 for a given accretion rate .",
    "an increase in the accretion rate will cause the radial optical depth from the stellar surface to @xmath307 to increase , if all other physical quantities remain constant , and hence the sonic point will move inward to the smaller radius @xmath308 at which the optical depth from the stellar surface is approximately the same as before , causing an increase in the orbital frequency at the sonic radius .",
    "the x - ray luminosity between bursts is produced almost entirely by accretion and hence an increase in the accretion rate causes an increase in the luminosity .",
    "we therefore expect a strong , positive correlation between the frequencies of the sonic - point keplerian- and beat - frequency qpos and the persistent x - ray luminosity .",
    "these basic ideas are illustrated by the general relativistic accretion flow calculations of   3.2 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : nukvsl ] , the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies given by these calculations increase steeply with increasing mass accretion rate until the sonic point reaches @xmath94 , at which point their frequencies stop changing .",
    "this flattening of the two frequency vs.  accretion luminosity relations is one possible signature of the existence of a marginally stable orbit ( see also   5.4 ) .",
    "coherent keplerian- and beat - frequency qpos are unlikely to be produced if the sonic point moves inward , close to the stellar surface , because of the disruptive effect of the surface magnetic field and the strong viscous shear layer that is expected to develop if the keplerian flow interacts directly with the neutron star surface .",
    "we emphasize that these calculations are intended to be illustrative rather than to reproduce the qpo frequency behavior of any particular source .",
    "if the mass of the neutron star is @xmath302 , rather than @xmath101 as assumed in these calculations , the limiting frequency would be 1.3  rather than 1.6  ( see miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) . again , if the accretion disk is thicker near the star than is assumed in these calculations , more of the inner disk will be illuminated and hence the angular momentum loss radius @xmath81 will be larger , causing the sonic - point keplerian frequency at a given accretion rate to be lower . if the disk thickness changes with accretion rate , then the variation of the sonic - point keplerian frequency with accretion rate will be different from the variation found in the calculations reported here , which treat the disk thickness as constant . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "the calculations described here show that an increase in the mass accretion rate leads naturally to an increase in the sonic - point keplerian frequency .",
    "we stress that caution must be used in comparing the predicted variation of qpo frequencies with accretion with the countrate measured by a given x - ray detector , because countrates are known to be poor indicators of the mass accretion rate and the accretion luminosity , at least for some sources at some times .",
    "the most likely reason is that a particular instrument measures the photon number flux over only a restricted energy range and that a change in the mass accretion rate typically causes a change in the shape of the x - ray spectrum as well as its normalization .",
    "hence the detector countrate typically is not proportional to the accretion rate .    in the z sources ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is known to be different when the countrate is the same but the source is on a different branch of the z track ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; lamb 1989 ; psaltis et al.1995 ) . moreover , in the `` cyg - like '' z sources , the normal / flaring branch vertex , which is thought to correspond to a mass accretion rate approximately equal to @xmath152 ( lamb 1989 ) , occurs at different countrates during different observations ( kuulkers 1995 ) .",
    "the observations of ford et al .",
    "( 1997a ) show that the properties of the accretion flow are not uniquely related to the x - ray countrate in the atoll sources . in these observations , the dependence of the kilohertz qpo frequencies on countrate seen in data on taken with  in 1996 august differs , both in slope and in normalization , from the dependence of the qpo frequencies on countrate seen in data taken in 1996 april .",
    "in contrast , when the qpo frequencies are plotted against the energy of the spectral peak , which may be a good indicator of the accretion rate ( psaltis & lamb 1998c ) , the slope and normalization of the curves are the same for both observations ( ford et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "clearly , bolometric and other corrections are typically important , so comparison of qpo frequency versus countrate data with the qpo frequency versus accretion rate predictions of theoretical models must be approached with caution . despite this caveat ,",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there is a strong , positive correlation between the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos seen in , , , and ks  1731@xmath309260 , and the countrate measured by , as expected in the sonic - point model if the countrate increases with increasing accretion rate .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about the dependence of kilohertz qpo frequencies on luminosity that is to be expected if such qpos are detected during a thermonuclear x - ray burst . in this case",
    "the mass accretion rate and the radial optical depth are no longer tied to the luminosity , and hence the expected dependence of @xmath104 on luminosity is different from what is expected during the periods between type  i x - ray bursts .",
    "when radiation forces are extremely strong , such as at the peak of a type  i x - ray burst that causes photospheric radius expansion , the radiation controls the accretion flow out to large radii and we therefore do not expect any qpo at the sonic - point keplerian frequency or at the sonic - point beat frequency .",
    "however , qpos at these frequencies may reappear in the tail of the burst . while the burst luminosity is several times the persistent accretion luminosity",
    ", we expect the sonic point to be farther from the star than when the luminosity is lower .",
    "thus , we expect that if sonic - point qpos are detected in the tail of a thermonuclear burst , their frequencies will increase as the luminosity declines .",
    "note , however , that during the decay phase of such a burst , the luminosity changes rapidly .",
    "if the frequencies of the qpos track this change , the qpo peaks in power spectra will be smeared out , unless the spectra are constructed from short ( @xmath310  s ) segments of data .",
    "so far , no kilohertz qpos have been observed near the maximum of type - i x - ray bursts , which is consistent with what is expected in the sonic - point model .",
    "more sensitive searches will be required to determine if kilohertz qpos are present during the decay phase of bursts .      _",
    "amplitudes of oscillations at different frequencies_.a key question that any theory of the kilohertz qpos must answer is why at most two strong qpos have so far been seen simultaneously in the kilohertz qpo sources . in addressing this question , it is important to consider both the _ generation _ of oscillations near the neutron star and the effects of _ propagation _ of the radiation through the gas surrounding the neutron star . in order to be detectable far away",
    ", an oscillation must be strong at the source or have a small attenuation , or both .",
    "the qpos at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies are the only qpos expected to have moderately high amplitudes far from the neutron star because the optical depth and luminosity oscillations that produce them generate relatively high amplitudes near the star , because these frequencies ( and their overtones ) are the _ only _ frequencies generated by the sonic - point mechanism in lowest order , and because scattering of photons by the gas surrounding the neutron star selectively suppresses the already weak higher - frequency oscillations generated at higher orders .    as discussed in   3.3 , to lowest ( first ) order , the sonic - point mechanism generates oscillations only at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies ( see table  [ table : freqgen ] ) . as explained there ,",
    "only very weak overtones of the sonic - point keplerian frequency are likely to be generated , because the angular distribution of the radiation from the bright impact footprints of the rotating density pattern produced by clumps is expected to be very broad .    the radiation pattern that rotates with the star is also expected to be broad , but at the sonic radius , where it interacts with the orbiting gas to generate the luminosity oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency , it is not likely to be perfectly sinusoidal",
    ". hence overtones of the sonic - point beat frequency @xmath107 may be generated in the inward mass flux from the clumps at the sonic radius , producing overtones of @xmath107 in the x - ray flux from the star .",
    "as radiation from the stellar surface propagates outward through the part of the central corona that extends beyond the sonic radius , the radiation pattern that rotates with the star is likely to be broadened further ( see below ) , reducing the amplitudes of oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and its overtones seen by a distant observer .",
    "in addition to the qpos at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies and their overtones , in second order the sonic - point mechanism also generates qpos at @xmath83 and @xmath311 and in third order at @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315 ( again see table  [ table : freqgen ] ) .",
    "these high - order oscillations are expected to be very weak , even near the neutron star .",
    "the attenuation of an oscillation depends strongly on whether it is a _ beaming _ oscillation or a _ luminosity _ oscillation ( see   3.6 ) .",
    "a beaming oscillation is an oscillation produced by rotation of an angular radiation pattern , like the beam of a lighthouse ; in a pure beaming oscillation , the luminosity remains constant as the radiation pattern rotates .",
    "in contrast , a luminosity oscillation is one produced by an oscillation of the luminosity of the source ; in a pure luminosity oscillation , the radiation pattern remains static as the luminosity oscillates . in the sonic - point model ,",
    "the sonic - point keplerian frequency is the only intrinsically strong beaming oscillation , and the sonic - point beat frequency is the only luminosity oscillation produced by the accretion flow .    in passing through a scattering region ,",
    "luminosity oscillations are attenuated only by time - of - flight smearing whereas beaming oscillations are also attenuated by the isotropization of the radiation pattern by the scattering . hence beaming",
    "oscillations are weakened more by propagation through a scattering corona .",
    "figure  [ fig : attenfactor ] compares the attenuation of luminosity and beaming oscillations produced at the center of a uniform , spherical , scattering cloud of radius @xmath316  cm , as a function of the optical depth of the cloud .",
    "the size of this cloud is comparable to the dimensions of the small scattering coronae with optical depths @xmath035 that are thought to surround the neutron stars in the atoll and z sources ( lamb 1989 , 1991 ; see also   2.2 ) .",
    "the frequencies of the oscillations shown in figure  [ fig : attenfactor ] have been chosen to represent a hypothetical accreting neutron star with @xmath317  hz and @xmath318  hz . the beat - frequency luminosity oscillation is therefore at 800  hz .",
    "the attenuation factors have been calculated using equations  ( [ eq : lumatten ] ) and ( [ eq : beamatten ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : attenfactor ] shows that the beaming oscillation at the sonic - point keplerian frequency must have a relatively high intrinsic amplitude in order to produce a strong , observable qpo for a distant observer , whereas the luminosity oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency needs only to have a moderate amplitude .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations at the overtones of either luminosity or beaming oscillations seen by a distant observer are expected to be far smaller than the amplitudes seen at the fundamental frequencies , for several reasons .",
    "for example , beaming patterns with multiple lobes are much more easily isotropized by scattering than are beaming patterns with single lobes ( see , e.g. , brainerd & lamb [ 1987 ] ) . moreover , for either beaming or luminosity oscillations , overtones of an oscillation are at higher frequencies than the fundamental and are thus more susceptible to time - of - flight smearing .    as a specific example",
    ", we consider .",
    "as interpreted within the sonic - point model , the spin frequency of this neutron star is 363  hz ( see table  3 ) . during one observation",
    ", @xmath104 was 1045  hz . assuming that this neutron star is surrounded by a central corona with a radius @xmath319  cm and an optical depth @xmath320 , the amplitude of the luminosity oscillation at the beat frequency @xmath321 seen by a distant observer is about 85% of the amplitude at the neutron star .",
    "for comparison , the beaming oscillation at @xmath322 , which is generated only in third order and is therefore likely to be very weak even near the neutron star , has an amplitude at infinity which is only about 20% of its amplitude at the star .",
    "the amplitudes of oscillations at the overtones of the sonic - point keplerian frequency are all reduced by factors @xmath32320 . for these reasons ,",
    "it is not surprising that the only strong qpos seen are at the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies .",
    "although oscillations at frequencies other than the sonic - point keplerian and beat frequencies are likely to be very weak , their amplitudes are surely not zero . we therefore expect that , if neutron - star lmxbs are observed with sufficient sensitivity , oscillations at other frequencies will be detected . in particular , a careful search near the spin frequency , at the first overtone of the beat frequency , and near the sum of the keplerian and spin frequencies in sources with pairs of high - frequency qpo peaks may reveal very weak qpos at these frequencies .",
    "the oscillation at the beat frequency is a _",
    "oscillation , but in the sonic - point model it is created by interaction of the weakly _ beamed _ radiation pattern that is rotating at the stellar spin frequency with the clumps of gas that are orbiting at or near the sonic point .",
    "it is therefore important to emphasize why the beaming oscillation at the stellar spin frequency is strong enough to modulate significantly the mass inflow rate from clumps at the sonic point , yet too weak to produce a significant peak in power spectra constructed by a distant observer .",
    "previous modeling of the x - ray spectra ( lamb 1989 , 1991 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1995 ; psaltis & lamb 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) and the 1100  hz x - ray variability of the atoll and z sources ( lamb 1989 , 1991 ; miller & lamb 1992 ) strongly indicates that a hot , central , comptonizing corona surrounds the neutron star , extending several stellar radii from its surface ( see   2.2 ) .",
    "the sonic radius is well inside this corona , so the scattering optical depth from the stellar surface to the sonic point is much less than the scattering optical depth from the stellar surface to infinity .",
    "the finite size of the neutron star also diminishes the effect of attenuation on the amplitude of x - ray brightness oscillations for gas orbiting close to the star .",
    "these factors make the brightness oscillation produced by the radiation pattern that rotates with the star much stronger at the sonic radius than it is far away .",
    "_ dependence of qpo amplitudes on accretion rate_.in the sonic - point model , the ratio of the amplitude of the qpo at the sonic - point keplerian frequency to the amplitude of the qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency generally depends on the strength of the neutron star magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is too weak to channel gas even near the stellar surface , the amplitude of the oscillation at the beat frequency will be too small to be detected ( see   3.1 ) .",
    "however , the ratio of the amplitudes of the qpos at different frequencies is also expected to depend on the mass accretion rate .",
    "for example , as the mass accretion rate rises , the electron density and optical depth of the gas around the neutron star also rise .",
    "hence , the amplitude at infinity of the beaming oscillation at the sonic - point keplerian frequency will fall faster relative to the amplitude of the luminosity oscillation at the sonic - point beat frequency , all else being equal ; indeed , the qpo at the keplerian frequency may become undetectable while the qpo at the beat frequency remains strong .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the observed behavior of the kilohertz qpo pair in ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996c ) , assuming that the increasing mass accretion rate causes an increase in the countrate ( but see   4.2 ) .",
    "in this source , the amplitude of the higher - frequency qpo decreases relative to the amplitude of the lower - frequency qpo as the countrate increases .    alternatively ,",
    "if the sonic point moves far enough away from the stellar surface , as may happen at low accretion rates ( and hence countrates ) , the optical depth through the flow from the stellar surface to the sonic radius may become large enough to reduce greatly the amplitude at the sonic point of the radiation pattern that rotates with the star , thereby suppressing the luminosity oscillation at @xmath107 .",
    "this is consistent with an observation of in which the lower - frequency qpo is not observed when the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo is low ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996c ) .",
    "this analysis shows that if only a _ single _ high - frequency qpo peak is observed , it could be either the sonic - point keplerian - frequency qpo or the sonic - point beat - frequency qpo , depending on the magnetic field of the neutron star and the mass accretion rate at the time . in this case , a secure identification can only be made by considering other properties of the qpo and comparing them with the properties of the qpos seen in other observations of the same source .",
    "_ dependence of qpo amplitudes on photon energy_.in the sonic - point model , the relative amplitudes of the keplerian frequency and beat frequency qpos are expected to increase steeply with photon energy over the @xmath0510  kev energy range ( see   3.5 ) .",
    "this is because the optical depth is expected to oscillate at both frequencies : the optical depth along the line of sight from the stellar surface oscillates at the keplerian frequency , while the total optical depth of the scattering region oscillates at the beat frequency as the density of the accreting gas falling on the stellar surface oscillates at this frequency . as shown in   3.5 ,",
    "a modest oscillation in the optical depth produces a qpo with a large relative amplitude at high photon energies .",
    "this is consistent with the steep increase of qpo amplitude with increasing photon energy observed in the higher - frequency of the two simultaneous qpos in ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ) , ( ford et al .",
    "1997b ) , and ks  1731@xmath309260 ( wijnands & van der klis 1997 ) , in the lower - frequency of the two simultaneous qpos in ( berger et al .",
    "1996 ; mndez et al .",
    "1998 ) and ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996c ) , and in the kilohertz qpos in the z sources ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996e ) , ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997c ) , and ( wijnands et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in   3.5 we used a simple analytical model to derive an expression for the photon energy dependence of the rms amplitude of a qpo produced by oscillations in the optical depth and in the injection rate of soft photons . figure  [ fig : ampvsenergy ] compares the results of a more detailed numerical calculation performed using the algorithm of miller & lamb ( 1992 ) with amplitude data for the lower - frequency kilohertz qpo observed in and the higher - frequency kilohertz qpo seen in . in performing this calculation",
    "we made the same assumptions as in ",
    "3.5 and assumed further that the injection rate of soft photons is constant in time , that the spectrum of the injected photons is a blackbody at temperature @xmath324  kev , that the electron temperature in the central corona is @xmath325  kev , and that the optical depth varies from @xmath326 to @xmath327 during an oscillation .",
    "the model matches the data well .",
    "the geometry of the actual upscattering region is undoubtedly much more complicated than assumed in this calculation , but the excellent correspondence with the data and the ubiquity of the steep increase of amplitude with photon energy over the 510  kev energy range suggest that the model has many elements in common with the true physical situation .    as a source moves in the x - ray color - color diagram and its spectrum changes ( implying a change in the average optical depth and electron temperature of the comptonizing region )",
    ", we expect that the photon energy dependence of the rms amplitude of the oscillations will also change .",
    "moreover , as discussed in  3.5 , we expect that , in general , the dependence of the beat - frequency qpo amplitude on photon energy will be different from the dependence of the keplerian - frequency qpo amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of ( ford et al.1997b ) in which amplitude versus photon energy curve of the beat - frequency qpo has a minimum at @xmath010  kev , whereas the amplitude versus photon energy curve of the keplerian - frequency qpo increases monotonically from 2  kev to 20  kev . because the qpos amplitude depend strongly on photon energy , to be meaningful a comparison of qpo amplitudes measured for different sources or at different times for the same source must consider the same range of photon energies .",
    "_ coherence of the kilohertz qpos_.in ",
    "3.4 we showed that the high coherence of the keplerian and beat - frequency qpos in the sonic - point model is primarily a consequence of the extremely sharp increase in the inward radial velocity near the sonic point , which maps a small range of orbital frequencies onto the stellar surface .",
    "there we also considered the decoherence caused by destruction of clumps by turbulent dissipation within the disk flow , by advection to the stellar surface , and by decay as gas is stripped from them by the supersonic flow at the sonic point .",
    "we concluded that the qpo peaks can be as narrow as observed ( @xmath328200 ) for reasonable conditions in the accretion flow .",
    "the fwhm @xmath329 of the sonic - point beat frequency oscillation is expected to be comparable to the fwhm @xmath330 of the sonic - point keplerian frequency oscillation , because the beat - frequency qpo is produced by the beat of a nearly periodic signal at frequency @xmath83 against the keplerian frequency ( see   3.4 ) .",
    "we do not expect the fwhm of the two kilohertz qpo peaks to be identical , however , because there are processes that can affect the fwhm of one but not the other .",
    "for example , the fwhm of the beat - frequency peak depends in part on the range of radii over which radiation forces can affect the mass accretion rate significantly",
    ". this range can be either less than or greater than the range of radii over which the inward radial velocity increases rapidly , and hence @xmath329 can be either less than or greater than @xmath330 .",
    "this effect can also displace the centroid of the beat - frequency peak relative to the centroid of the keplerian frequency peak , so that the observed frequency difference @xmath331 is close to , but not exactly equal to , the stellar spin frequency .      in the sonic - point model ,",
    "the larger the magnetosphere , the smaller the fraction of the accreting gas that reaches the surface of the star without coupling to the magnetic field , and hence the smaller the amplitude of the kilohertz qpos .",
    "therefore , we expect the rms amplitudes of the kilohertz qpos to be roughly anticorrelated with the strength of the stellar magnetic field , if all other physical quantities remain fixed . as discussed in   2.2 ,",
    "the `` 4u '' atoll sources are thought to have the weakest magnetic fields , the `` gx '' atoll sources and the `` sco - like '' z sources are thought to have somewhat stronger fields , and the `` cyg - like '' z sources are thought to have the strongest fields ( psaltis & lamb 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) .",
    "hence , we expect kilohertz qpos to be common and strong in the `` 4u '' atoll sources , but weak or even undetectable with current instruments in the `` gx '' atoll sources and the z sources .. to date , kilohertz qpos have not been detected in any of the gx atoll sources .",
    "] this is indeed the case , as is evident from table  [ table : reportedqpos ] .",
    "if , as indicated by the spectral modeling discussed in   2 , the magnetic field of cir  x-1 is weak , we expect it to exhibit sonic - point qpos when it is in its low state .",
    "we also expect that kilohertz qpos will be undetectable by current instruments in any sources that have strong magnetic fields and therefore produce strong , periodic oscillations at their spin frequencies .",
    "the relation between kilohertz qpo amplitude and magnetic field strength may be made semi - quantitative using the spectral calculations ( see   2.2 ) of psaltis et al .  ( 1995 ) and psaltis & lamb ( 1998a , 1998b , 1998c ) .",
    "these calculations indicate that lmxbs containing neutron stars with weaker magnetic fields generally have larger hard x - ray colors ( e.g. , the ratio of the 720  kev countrate to the 57  kev countrate ) . based on this physical picture , we expect the rms amplitudes of the kilohertz qpos produced by the sonic - point mechanism to be higher in sources with larger hard colors .",
    "this trend is evident in figure  [ fig : ampvshardcolor ] , which shows the rms amplitudes versus the hard x - ray colors of four sources observed with the pca detector onboard the satellite .",
    "if other sources with kilohertz qpos follow this same trend , this will be strong support for the sonic - point model .    as discussed in   2.3 ,",
    "the observed anticorrelation between kilohertz qpo amplitude and magnetic field strength is also strong evidence that the magnetospheric beat - frequency mechanism _ not _ the correct explanation of these oscillations .",
    "in the sonic - point model , the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair has a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of gas near the sonic point ; the relatively high coherence of this qpo is a consequence of the fact that the gas clumps that generate it are in nearly circular orbits . in this section",
    "we show that the inferred existence of a nearly circular orbit around a neutron star with a frequency in the kilohertz range can be used to derive interesting new upper bounds on the mass and radius of the star and constraints on the equation of state of the dense matter in all neutron stars . for simplicity",
    "we discuss first the case of a nonrotating star around which the radial component of the radiation force is negligible .",
    "we then consider the changes in the mass and radius constraints caused by frame - dragging when the star is spinning and by the radial component of the radiation force .",
    "we show that rotation at @xmath40  hz typically increases the bound on the mass by @xmath86% and the bound on the radius by a few percent . in contrast , the radiation force _ reduces _ the upper bounds on the masses and radii by a few percent or less in the atoll sources but perhaps by much larger percentages in the z sources .",
    "observations of kilohertz qpos may be able to establish the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit around some neutron stars ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "if this can be accomplished , it would be the first evidence concerning a prediction of general relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "if furthermore the frequency of a particular kilohertz qpo can be securely established as the orbital frequency at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit and if the spin frequency of the neutron star can be determined , then the frequency of the qpo can be used to fix the mass of the neutron star for each assumed equation of state , tightening the constraints on the properties of dense matter and possibly ruling out many currently viable equations of state .",
    "we discuss how this can be done and the evidence that would signal detection of a qpo with the orbital frequency of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "suppose that the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz pair is @xmath23 and that , as in the sonic - point model , @xmath23 is the orbital frequency of gas in a nearly circular keplerian orbit around the neutron star .",
    "assume for now that the star is not rotating and is spherically symmetric .",
    "then the exterior spacetime is the schwarzschild spacetime . in this spacetime ,",
    "the orbital frequency ( measured at infinity ) of gas in a circular orbit at boyer - lindquist radius @xmath100 around a star of mass @xmath65 is ( see eq .  [ [ eq : sonickeplerfreq ] ] ) @xmath332 here and below the superscript zero indicates that the relation is that for a nonrotating star .",
    "if the mass of the star is known , equation  ( [ eq : keplerfreqzero ] ) may be solved for the orbital radius @xmath333 where the keplerian frequency is @xmath23 , with the result @xmath334 conversely , if the orbital radius of the gas is known , equation  ( [ eq : keplerfreqzero ] ) may be solved for the mass of the star that gives an orbital frequency equal to @xmath23 , with the result @xmath335 if , as is so far the case for the kilohertz qpo sources , neither @xmath65 nor @xmath333 are known , equations  ( [ eq : orbitalradiuszero ] ) and  ( [ eq : orbitalmasszero ] ) do not determine @xmath333 or @xmath65 but do establish a relation between them . in the radius - mass plane , this relation is a curve that begins at the origin and rises up and to the right .    as a specific example ,",
    "the dashed curve marked @xmath336 in figure  [ fig : pieslice ] shows the relation given by equation  ( [ eq : orbitalmasszero ] ) for @xmath337  , a value of @xmath23 observed in ( w.  zhang , personal communication ) .",
    "hence , if were not rotating , the mass of the neutron star in this source and the orbital radius of the gas clumps producing the qpo during this observation would have to correspond to some point along this dashed curve .",
    "consider now the constraints on the neutron star mass and radius that follow from the _ frequency _ of the higher - frequency qpo . obviously , in order for gas to be in orbit , it must be outside the star .",
    "this means that for an orbit of given radius @xmath333 , the mass @xmath65 of the star must be greater than @xmath338 ; alternatively , for a star of given mass @xmath65 , the radius @xmath54 of the star must be less than @xmath339 .",
    "thus , the point that represents the mass and radius of the neutron star must lie above the curve @xmath338 in the radius - mass plane .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath23 , the higher the curve , so the most stringent  and hence the relevant  constraint on the mass and radius of the neutron star in a particular source is given by the _ highest _ value of @xmath23 ever observed in that source , which we denote @xmath340 . for example",
    ", 1220  hz is the highest value of @xmath23 seen so far in , so this is the current value of @xmath340 for this source ( in fact , this is the highest value of @xmath341 seen so far in _ any _ source ) .",
    "consequently , if the neutron star in were not rotating , the point in the radius - mass plane that represents its mass and radius would have to lie above the curve , which is the dashed curve shown in figure  [ fig : pieslice ] .",
    "so far , the only information we have used to constrain the mass and radius of the star is the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz pair .",
    "however , we have the additional information that the _ coherence _ of the higher - frequency qpo is high ( ) in many sources .",
    "let us assume that the higher - frequency qpo in a pair is generated by the same mechanism in all sources that show such pairs .",
    "then the high coherence of these higher - frequency qpos imposes additional constraints on the neutron star s mass and radius because , in order to produce a qpo with such high coherence , the gas that generates the qpo must be in a nearly circular orbit .",
    "hence @xmath342 must be greater than the radius @xmath343 of the innermost stable circular orbit , because gas inside @xmath94 spirals quickly inward to the stellar surface .    for a nonrotating star ,",
    "the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit is a function only of the mass of the star and is given by .",
    "inverting this relation gives @xmath344 in the radius - mass plane , relation  ( [ eq : msmasszero ] ) is a straight line of slope @xmath345 through the origin and is the dotted line marked @xmath346 in figure  [ fig : pieslice ] .",
    "this line intersects @xmath347 at the mass and radius values @xmath348 and @xmath349 if @xmath65 were larger than @xmath350 , the orbital radius @xmath351 of the gas generating the qpo would be less than @xmath352 , so @xmath353 is an upper bound on the mass of the star ; @xmath350 is inversely proportional to @xmath23 but independent of the star s radius and the orbital radius of the gas clumps that are producing the higher - frequency qpo .",
    "similarly , @xmath354 is an upper bound on the radius of the star ; @xmath354 is also inversely proportional to @xmath23 but independent of the star s mass and the orbital radius of the gas clumps that are producing the higher - frequency qpo .",
    "the heavy horizontal line plotted in figure  [ fig : pieslice ] shows the upper bound on the mass of a nonrotating star for @xmath355 .",

    "@xmath358 is 16.0  km , so the radius of the neutron star in would have to be be less than this if the star were not rotating .",

    "these equations of state all give maximum gravitational masses of about @xmath356 for nonrotating stars .    as an example of the mass - radius curves given by later realistic equations of state , we show the mass - radius curve predicted by the uu equation of state ( wiringa , fiks , & fabrocini 1988 ) .",

    "the uu equation of state gives a maximum mass of about @xmath370 for a nonrotating neutron star .",

    "the maximum mass of a nonrotating star constructed using equation of state l is @xmath371 .",
    "we also show the mass - radius curve given by the very early tensor interaction ( ti ) equation of state of pandharipande & smith ( 1975a ; m in the arnett & bowers [ 1977 ] survey ) and the reid soft - core equation of state of pandharipande ( 1971 ; a in the arnett & bowers [ 1977 ] survey ) .",
    "the maximum masses of nonrotating stars constructed using equations of state m and a are @xmath356 and @xmath372 , respectively .",

    "if the mass - radius relation given by a particular equation of state intersects the allowed region defined by the highest qpo frequency seen in a given source , that particular equation of state is viable .",
    "if that equation of state is furthermore the correct equation of state , the mass and radius of the neutron star in the source must correspond to one of the points along the segment of the mass - radius relation that lies within the pie - slice shaped region , so the mass and radius of the star are bounded from above _ and _ from below ; for most equations of state , only a narrow range of radii is allowed .    for example",
    ", the highest - frequency qpo so far seen in any source is the 1220  hz qpo observed in ( w.  zhang , personal communication ) .",
    "hence , if equation of state m is the correct equation of state , then the mass and radius of the neutron star in would have to satisfy @xmath373 and @xmath374 if it were nonrotating .",
    "if equation of state m is the correct equation of state and 1220  hz is identified as the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit , then the mass and radius of the neutron star in would be determined as about @xmath356 and between 11  and 12  , if the star were not rotating .",
    "an equation of state that gives a mass - radius relation that does _ not _ intersect the region allowed for a given source is ruled out for that source .",
    "we stress that _ because the equation of state of the matter in neutron stars is expected to be essentially the same in all such stars , an equation of state that is inconsistent with the properties of any neutron star is excluded for all neutron stars_. for example , observation of a 1500  hz keplerian orbital frequency in any source would rule out equations of state l and m.    so far our discussion of constraints on the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources has assumed that they are not rotating .",
    "as we discuss in the next subsection , the changes in these constraints caused by the spin of the star are likely to be small in most sources .",
    "rotation affects the structure of the star for a given mass and equation of state and the spacetime exterior to the star .",
    "hence the mass - radius relation , the orbital frequency at a given radius , and the radius @xmath94 of the innermost stable circular orbit are all affected . as a result ,",
    "the bounds on the mass and radius of the star and the constraints on the equation of state implied by observation of a kilohertz qpo of a given frequency are affected .",
    "obviously , the size of these effects depends on the spin rate of the star . treating these effects",
    "accurately will be particularly important if the frequency of a kilohertz qpo is ever securely identified as the keplerian frequency at the marginally stable orbit around a neutron star ( see   5.4 ) , because the ability to rule out some equations of state may depend on it .",
    "the parameter that characterizes the importance of rotational effects is the dimensionless quantity , where @xmath88 and @xmath65 are the angular momentum and gravitational mass of the star .",
    "the value of @xmath90 that corresponds to a given observed spin frequency depends on the neutron star mass and equation of state , and is typically higher for lower masses and stiffer equations of state .",
    "for example , at the 363  hz spin frequency inferred for ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996c ) , a @xmath101 neutron star with the softer equation of state a has , whereas a @xmath101 neutron star with the very stiff equation of state l has ( see table  [ table : jvalues ] ) .    as discussed in   5.1 ,",
    "if the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair is an orbital frequency , then the region of the radius - mass plane allowed for the neutron star in that source is bounded below by the curve @xmath375 , which gives the orbital radius at which the keplerian frequency is equal to the highest observed frequency @xmath340 of the higher - frequency qpo .",
    "given @xmath90 , it is straightforward to compute the orbital radius for any given orbital frequency as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is not @xmath90 but instead the star s spin frequency @xmath83 that is determined by the observations .",
    "hence , _ to obtain the relevant @xmath376 curve one must vary @xmath90 in such a way that @xmath195 is kept constant as @xmath65 is varied_. moreover , @xmath90 depends not only on @xmath195 and @xmath65 but also on the equation of state .",
    "thus the relevant @xmath376 curve depends not only on the star s spin rate , but also on the equation of state assumed .",
    "therefore , for rotating stars ( unlike static stars ) , one can not present a single @xmath375 curve that constrains all equations of state , even for a star with a given spin frequency .    as also discussed in   5.1 ,",
    "the region of the radius - mass plane allowed for the neutron star in a given source is bounded above by the horizontal line @xmath377 , which is the mass at which the curve @xmath376 intersects the curve @xmath343 ; the radius @xmath54 of the star is bounded above by @xmath378 .",
    "the two curves @xmath362 and @xmath376 are both affected by rotation of the star , so @xmath379 depends on the stellar spin rate .    determining the mass at which is equivalent to determining the mass at which @xmath380 is equal to @xmath340 . here",
    "we focus on the latter condition .",
    "the allowed mass of a rotating star is bounded above if , as @xmath65 is increased at constant @xmath83 , the orbital frequency @xmath381 crosses the qpo frequency @xmath340 from above , once and only once .",
    "as we show below , this is the case for slowly rotating stars .",
    "however , this may not be the case for some neutron star equations of state and spin rates .",
    "( for a kerr black hole with fixed spin frequency , @xmath382 first decreases and then increases with increasing mass . )    fortunately , most of the neutron stars that exhibit kilohertz qpos appear to have spin frequencies in the range 250350  hz ( see   4.2 ) , which is low enough that a first - order treatment of rotational effects is adequate . to see this",
    ", note that neutron stars with masses have moments of inertia , so stars with spin frequencies have @xmath90-values ( see table  [ table : jvalues ] ) .",
    "the lowest - order changes in the structure of a rotating star are @xmath383 so , to first order in @xmath90 , the mass - radius relation and moment of inertia of a rotating star are the same as for a nonrotating star of the same mass ( hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",
    "thus the error made by neglecting higher - order terms is for spin frequencies .",
    "we now compute the mass and radius constraints imposed on a slowly rotating neutron star by observation of a kilohertz orbital frequency .",
    "the calculation is simplified by the fact that to first order in @xmath90 , the spacetime outside a uniformly and steadily rotating relativistic star is the same as the kerr spacetime for the same @xmath65 and @xmath90 ( hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",
    "consider first the effect of stellar rotation on the motion of gas orbiting the star . to first order in @xmath90 , the orbital frequency ( measured at infinity ) of gas in a prograde keplerian orbit at a given boyer - lindquist radius @xmath100",

    "expressions  ( [ eq : keplerfreqfirst ] ) and  ( [ eq : msradiusfirst ] ) are first - order expansions of the exact expressions for these quantities given by bardeen , press , & teukolsky ( 1972 ) for the kerr spacetime . hence , to first order in @xmath90 , the frequency of the prograde orbit at @xmath94 around a star of given mass @xmath65 and dimensionless angular momentum @xmath90 is ( cf .",

    "therefore , _ the net effect of the star s rotation is to increase the frequency of the prograde orbit at @xmath94_.    as explained above , the region of the radius - mass plane allowed for a given star is not the region allowed for constant @xmath90 but is instead the region allowed for constant @xmath83 . to demonstrate that the mass and radius of the star are bounded from above , it is sufficient to show that @xmath381 decreases with increasing @xmath65 at fixed @xmath83 , or equivalently , that @xmath390 for all @xmath65 for the equation of state under consideration .",

    ", it is sufficient ( but not necessary ) to show that @xmath394 is always less than 2 .",
    "this is the case for all the equations of state tabulated by cook et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and is the case even for incompressible matter , which is unphysically stiff .",
    "( for a star made of incompressible matter , @xmath395 , so . )",
    "thus , _ for slowly rotating stars @xmath381 decreases with increasing mass for constant @xmath83 , so the masses and radii of such stars are bounded above_.    computation of the mass and radius constraints is straightforward but depends on the stellar spin rate and equation of state .",
    "the upper bounds on the mass and radius are given implicitly by @xmath396m^\\nonrot_{\\rm max }     \\label{eq : firstmaxmass}\\ ] ] and @xmath397r^\\nonrot_{\\rm max}\\ ; ,     \\label{eq : firstmaxradius}\\ ] ] where @xmath398 is the value of @xmath90 for the observed stellar spin rate at the maximum allowed mass for the equation of state being considered and @xmath350 and @xmath354 are the maximum allowed mass and radius for a nonrotating star ( see eqs .  [ [ eq : massboundzero ] ] and  [ [ eq : radiusboundzero ] ] ) .",
    "expressions  ( [ eq : firstmaxmass ] ) and  ( [ eq : firstmaxradius ] ) show that _ the bounds are always greater for a slowly rotating star than for a nonrotating star , regardless of the equation of state assumed_.    figure  [ fig : rotationeffects ] illustrates the effects of stellar rotation on the region of the radius - mass plane allowed for a given star for spin rates @xmath399 , like those inferred for the kilohertz qpo sources , and , the frequency of the highest - frequency qpo so far observed in , which is also the highest - frequency qpo so far observed in any source .",
    "our calculations show that _ the mass of the neutron star in must be less than @xmath400 and its radius must be less than @xmath401_. as explained above , the precise upper bounds depend on the equation of state assumed .    for rapidly rotating stars , @xmath90 is not small compared to unity and the structure of the star depends appreciably on its rotation rate .",
    "derivation of bounds on the mass and radius of a given star for an assumed equation of state therefore requires construction of a sequence of stellar models and spacetimes for different masses using the assumed equation of state , with @xmath83 as measured at infinity held fixed .",
    "the maximum and minimum possible masses and radii allowed by the observed qpo frequency can then be determined .",
    "the luminosities of the z sources are typically @xmath402 , where @xmath29 is the eddington luminosity ( see   2 ) .",
    "hence , in the z sources the outward acceleration caused by the radial component of the radiation force can be a substantial fraction of the inward acceleration caused by gravity .",
    "therefore , in these sources the radial component of the radiation force must be included in computing the keplerian orbital frequency near the neutron star and taken into account when constraints on the mass and radius of the star are derived using the procedures discussed in   5.1 and   5.2 .",
    "the radially outward component of the radiation force reduces the orbital frequency at a given radius .",
    "for example , if the star is spherical and nonrotating and emits radiation uniformly and isotropically from its entire surface , the orbital frequency ( measured at infinity ) of a test particle at boyer - lindquist radius @xmath100 is @xmath403^{1/2}\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : radforcefreq}\\ ] ] where @xmath404 is the luminosity of the star measured at infinity and @xmath405 is the keplerian frequency in the absence of radiation forces .",
    "thus , the boyer - lindquist radius of a circular orbit with a given frequency is smaller in the presence of the radial radiation force and the constraints on the mass and radius of the star are therefore tightened .    for the atoll sources , which have luminosities @xmath406 ,",
    "the change in the keplerian frequency is at most @xmath05% . for the z sources , on the other hand , which have luminosities",
    ", the change may be much larger , although the change in the sonic - point keplerian frequency may be smaller than would be suggested by a naive application of equation  ( [ eq : radforcefreq ] ) , if a substantial fraction of the radiation produced near the star is scattered out of the disk plane before it reaches the sonic point .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the effect of the radial radiation force on the constraints on the mass and radius of the star will be reported elsewhere .      as explained in   4.2 ,",
    "observations of kilohertz qpo sources may be able to demonstrate the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit around some of the neutron stars in these sources .",
    "if so , this would be the first confirmation of a strong - field prediction of general relativity and an important step forward in our understanding of strong - field gravity .",
    "if the frequency of a kilohertz qpo produced by an lmxb can be securely established as the orbital frequency at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit and the spin frequency of the star can be determined , the mass of the neutron star in that source can be determined for each assumed equation of state .",
    "depending on the range of allowed equations of state and masses , this could have profound consequences for our understanding of the equation of state of neutron stars .",
    "for example , establishing a mass of @xmath407 for a slowly rotating neutron star would rule out eight of the twelve currently viable equations of state considered by cook et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "given the profound consequences that would follow from identifying the frequency of a kilohertz qpo with the orbital frequency of the innermost stable orbit in any source , it is very important to establish what would constitute strong , rather than merely suggestive , evidence of such a detection .",
    "observations that would signal detection of the innermost stable orbit include the following :    _ qpo frequency signature_.the strongest evidence that a qpo with the orbital frequency of the innermost stable orbit has been detected would be reproducible observation of a fairly coherent , kilohertz qpo with a frequency that first increases steeply with accretion rate but then , at a high frequency , becomes nearly constant as the accretion rate continues to increase ( see   3.3 ,   4.2 , and fig .",
    "the qpo frequency will approach a constant because the sonic point in the flow can not retreat closer to the star than the radius of the marginally stable orbit and coherent qpos are not expected from the rapidly inspiraling gas inside the sonic point .",
    "although the count rate above which the frequency becomes constant may vary , the constant frequency itself should not vary , because the orbital frequency of the marginally stable orbit depends only on the mass and rotation rate of the neutron star , which remain almost constant over many years .    in the sonic - point model ,",
    "the frequency of the lower - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair is the beat frequency and therefore should also increase steeply with accretion rate at first but then become approximately constant at the same accretion rate at which the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo becomes constant .",
    "_ qpo amplitude signature_.a second signature that the marginally stable orbit has been detected would be reproducible observation of a decrease in the amplitude of the lower - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair or a simultaneous decrease in the amplitudes of both qpos in a pair , at a qpo frequency that is always the same in a given source .",
    "the amplitude of the qpo at the beat frequency is expected to decrease once the sonic point has moved inward to the marginally stable orbit because in the sonic - point model , the qpo at the beat frequency is generated by the drag force exerted by the radiation coming from the stellar surface that reaches the sonic point .",
    "therefore , a strong qpo is expected at the sonic - point beat frequency only if the drag force exerted by the radiation is dynamically important at the sonic point .",
    "if , however , the sonic point has moved inward to the innermost stable orbit and remains there as the accretion rate continues to increase , the optical depth from the stellar surface to the sonic point will continue to rise and radiation drag will become less and less important there , causing modulation of the inflow from the sonic point by the radiation force to weaken .",
    "thus , a decrease in the amplitude of the qpo at the sonic - point beat frequency with increasing accretion rate would signal the approach of the sonic - point to the radius of the innermost stable orbit ( see   3.1 ) .",
    "if radiation forces play an important role in creating or amplifying the clumps that produce the qpos ( see   3.1 ) , the amplitude of the keplerian - frequency qpo may also decrease with increasing accretion rate , once the radius of the sonic point has reached the radius of the innermost stable orbit ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "_ possible qpo coherence signature_.a possible signature that the orbit of the gas that is generating the qpo has receded inside the radius of the marginally stable orbit would be a steep drop in the coherence of both qpos in a kilohertz qpo pair ( or in the coherence of the keplerian - frequency qpo , if the beat - frequency qpo is not visible ) , at a certain critical frequency , as the frequencies of the qpos increase steadily with accretion rate .",
    "this would occur if radiation forces are able to generate clumping in the flow at a radius inside the sonic point .",
    "if this occurs at all , clumps are likely to be produced at a range of radii and to last only a short time , so any oscillations that may be generated are likely to have low coherence ( see   3.4 )",
    ". the critical frequency would be the orbital frequency at the marginally stable orbit and hence should always be the same in a given source .",
    "approach of the sonic radius to the radius of the innermost stable orbit can be distinguished from approach of the sonic radius to the radius of the star because coherent keplerian- and beat - frequency qpos may continue in the fist case but are very unlikely in the second .",
    "kilohertz qpos are unlikely to be generated if the sonic point moves close to the stellar surface because of the disruptive effect of the stellar magnetic field and the the viscous shear layer that is expected to develop if the keplerian flow interacts directly with the stellar surface ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "the sonic - point model explains naturally the most important features of the kilohertz qpos observed in the atoll and z sources , including their frequencies , large amplitudes , and high coherence .",
    "it also explains the frequent occurrence of two simultaneous qpos , the observed steep increase of kilohertz qpo amplitudes with increasing photon energy in the @xmath0510  kev energy range , and the anticorrelation of kilohertz qpo amplitudes with the strength of the stellar magnetic field inferred from spectral models .",
    "an attractive feature of the sonic - point model is that the magnetic fields , accretion rates , and scattering optical depths that it requires are completely consistent with those inferred previously from observations and modeling of the x - ray spectra and lower - frequency x - ray variability of the kilohertz qpo sources .",
    "( 1 )  _ kilohertz qpos with the properties seen in the atoll and z sources should not be observed in black - hole lmxbs _ , because collision of the accretion flow with the stellar surface plays an essential role in the sonic - point model .",
    "( 2 )  _ the rms amplitudes of the kilohertz qpos should be anticorrelated with the strength of the neutron star s magnetic field_. from this it follows that kilohertz qpos should be very weak or undetectable with current instruments in the gx group of atoll sources and in the cyg - like z sources ( which include 2 , , and ) , and undetectable with current instruments in any sources that have strong magnetic fields and therefore produce strong , periodic oscillations at their spin frequencies .",
    "( after this specific prediction was made in the original version of this paper , kilohertz qpos with very low amplitudes were detected in all six of the originally identified z sources ; see   4.4 . )",
    "another consequence of expectation  ( 2 ) is that the positive correlation of rms amplitude with hard color shown by the four sources plotted in figure  [ fig : ampvshardcolor ] should be found to be general among sources showing kilohertz qpos .",
    "( 4 )  _ weak oscillations should eventually be detected at overtones of the sonic - point beat and keplerian frequencies and perhaps at the stellar spin frequency , but oscillations at other frequencies , such as @xmath408 , should be extremely weak . _    at a lower level of certainty , the sonic - point model suggests that ( 1 )  the dependence of qpo amplitude on photon energy will change as the x - ray spectrum of the source changes , ( 2 )  the amplitude of the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair will drop relative to the amplitude of the lower - frequency qpo at high luminosities , and ( 3 )  either the lower - frequency qpo or the higher - frequency qpo in a pair may be undetectable even when the other qpo is detectable .    in closing , we emphasize that measurement of keplerian frequencies in the kilohertz range provides interesting new upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources and important new constraints on the equation of state of the matter in all neutron stars , as we have shown in   5 .",
    "as we demonstrated there , if the neutron star in the atoll source has a spin frequency of @xmath409  hz , as indicated by the difference between the spin frequencies of its two high - frequency qpos , the 1220  hz qpo observed in this source constrains its mass to be less than about @xmath370 and its radius to be less than about 17  km ; the precise bounds depend on the equation of state assumed .",
    "if at some future time we are able to demonstrate the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit around one or more neutron stars using observations of kilohertz qpos , this would be the first confirmation of a prediction of general relativity in the strong - field regime and a major advance in our understanding of strong - field gravity . if the frequency of a kilohertz qpo is securely established as the orbital frequency at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit in a particular system by , for example , observing the signatures discussed in   5 , and",
    "if , in addition , the spin frequency of the neutron star can be determined , then the frequency of the qpo will fix the mass of the neutron star for each assumed equation of state , providing a better understanding of the properties of dense matter and possibly ruling out many currently viable equations of state .",

    "<S> quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies ranging from @xmath0300  hz to @xmath01200  hz have been discovered in the x - ray emission from fourteen neutron stars in low - mass binary systems and from another neutron star in the direction of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> these kilohertz qpos are very strong , with rms relative amplitudes ranging up to @xmath015% of the total x - ray countrate , and are remarkably coherent , with frequency to fwhm ratios as large as @xmath0200 . </S>",
    "<S> two simultaneous kilohertz qpos differing in frequency by @xmath0250350  hz have been detected in twelve of the fifteen sources .    </S>",
    "<S> here we propose a model for these qpos . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray source is a neutron star with a surface magnetic field @xmath1  </S>",
    "<S> g and a spin frequency of a few hundred hertz , accreting gas via a keplerian disk . </S>",
    "<S> some of the accreting gas is channeled by the stellar magnetic field but some remains in a keplerian disk flow that penetrates to within a few kilometers of the stellar surface . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair is the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point at the inner edge of the keplerian flow whereas the frequency of the lower - frequency qpo is approximately the difference between the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point and the stellar spin frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the frequencies of the pair of qpos is therefore close to ( but not necessarily exactly equal to ) the stellar spin frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the qpos at the sonic - point keplerian frequency and at the beat frequency depend on the strength of the neutron star s magnetic field and the accretion rate and hence one or both of these qpos may sometimes be undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and its overtones are expected to be weak but may sometimes be detectable .    </S>",
    "<S> this model is consistent with the magnetic field strengths , accretion rates , and scattering optical depths inferred from previous modeling of the x - ray spectra and rapid x - ray variability of the atoll and z sources . </S>",
    "<S> it explains naturally the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos and the similarity of these frequencies in sources with different accretion rates and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the model also explains the high coherence and large amplitudes of the kilohertz qpos , and the steep increase of qpo amplitude with photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in qpo frequency with inferred accretion rate seen in many sources is also understandable in this model .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the frequency of the higher - frequency qpo in a pair is an orbital frequency , as in the sonic - point model , the frequencies of these qpos place interesting upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in the kilohertz qpo sources and provide new constraints on the equation of state of matter at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> further observations of these qpos may provide compelling evidence for the existence of a marginally stable orbit , confirming a key prediction of general relativity in the strong - field regime .    </S>",
