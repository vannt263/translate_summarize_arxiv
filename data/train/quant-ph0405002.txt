    "entanglement has been identified as a resource central to much of quantum information processing  @xcite . to date , progress in the quantification of entanglement for mixed states has resided primarily in the domain of bipartite systems  @xcite . for multipartite systems in pure and mixed states",
    "the characterziation and quantification of entanglement presents even greater challenges . even for multipartite pure states",
    "it is not clear whether there exists a finite minimal reversible entanglement generating set ( mregs )  @xcite and , if it exists , what the set is .",
    "this complicates the task of extending measures such as entanglement of distillation  @xcite and formation  @xcite to multipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the characterization of multipartite entanglement remains incomplete .    on the other hand ,",
    "quantifying multipartite entanglement via other measures , such as relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite , is still a challenging task , even for _ pure _ states .",
    "one reason for the difficulty is the absence , in general , of schmidt decompositions for multipartite pure states  @xcite .",
    "this implies that for multipartite pure states the entropies of the reduced density matrices can differ , in contrast to bipartite pure states , as the following example shows .",
    "consider a three - qubit pure state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "the reduced density matrices for parties a , b , and c are , respectively ,    @xmath2    which , in general , have different entropies .",
    "thus , for a multipartite pure state the entropy of the reduced density matrix does not give a consistent entanglement measure .",
    "however , even in the case in which all parties have the identical entropy , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath3  @xcite , it is in general nontrivial to obtain the relative entropy of entanglement for the state . more generally , for pure multipartite states , it is not yet known how to obtain their relative entropy of entanglement analytically .",
    "the situation is even worse for _ mixed _ multipartite states .",
    "recently , a multipartite entanglement measure based on the geometry of hilbert space has been proposed  @xcite . for pure states ,",
    "this geometric measure of entanglement depends on the maximal overlap between the entangled state and unentangled states , and is easy to compute numerically .",
    "the measure has been applied to several bipartite and multipartite pure and mixed states  @xcite , including two distinct multipartite bound entangled states  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we explore connections between this measure and the relative entropy of entanglement . for certain pure states , some bipartite and some multipartite , this lower bound is saturated , and thus their relative entropy of entanglement can be found analytically , in terms of their known geometric measure of entanglement . for certain mixed states , upper bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement are also established .",
    "numerical evidence strongly suggests that these upper bounds are tight , i.e. , they are actually the relative entropy of entanglement . these results , although not general enough to solve the problem of calculating the relative entropy of entanglement for arbitrary multipartite states , may offer some insight into , and serve as a testbed for , future analytic progress related to the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : measures]in this section we briefly review the two measures considered in the present paper : the relative entropy of entanglement and the geometric measure of entanglement .      the relative entropy @xmath4 between two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined via @xmath7 which is evidently not symmetric under exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and is non - negative , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement ( re ) for a mixed state @xmath5 is defined to be the minimal relative entropy of @xmath5 over the set of separable mixed states  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the set of all separable states .",
    "in general , the task of finding the re for arbitrary states @xmath5 involves a minimization over all separable states , and this renders the computation of the re very difficult . for bipartite pure states , the re is equal to entanglements of formation and of distillation .",
    "but , despite recent progress  @xcite , for mixed states  even in the simplest setting of two qubits  no analog of wootters formula  @xcite for the entanglement of formation has been found .",
    "things are even worse in multipartite settings . even for pure states , there has not been a systematic method for computing relative entropies of entanglement .",
    "it is thus worthwhile seeking cases in which one can explicitly obtain an expression for the re .",
    "a trivial case arises when there exists a schmidt decomposition for a multipartite pure state : in this case , the re is the usual expression @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s are schmidt coefficients ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "we shall see that there exist cases in which the re can be determined analytically , even though there is no schmidt decomposition .",
    "we remark that an alternative definition of re is to replace the set of separable states by the set of postive partial transpose ( ppt ) states .",
    "the re thus defined , as well as its regularized version , gives a tighter bound on distillable entanglement .",
    "there has been important progress in calculating the re ( and its regularized version ) with respect to ppt states for certain bipartite mixed states ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for more detailed discussions . for",
    "multipartite settings one could also use this definition , and define the set of states to optimize over to be the set of states that are ppt with respect to all bipartite partitionings .",
    "however , we shall use the first definition , i.e. , optimization over the set of completely separable states , throughout the discussion of the present paper .",
    "we continue by briefly reviewing the formulation of this measure in both pure - state and mixed - state settings .",
    "let us start with a multipartite system comprising @xmath14 parts , each of which can have a distinct hilbert space .",
    "consider a general @xmath14-partite pure state ( expanded in the local bases @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 satisfies the stationarity conditions    [ eqn : eigen ] @xmath17    in which the eigenvalues @xmath18 are associated with the lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint @xmath19 , and lie in @xmath20 $ ] , and the symbol @xmath21 denotes exclusion .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of @xmath18 s can be interpreted as the cosine of the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; the largest , @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath25 with the smallest angle @xmath26 ) , which we call the _ entanglement eigenvalue _",
    ", corresponds to the closest separable state , and is the maximal overlap with unentangled states : @xmath27 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary separable pure state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the particular form @xmath28 was defined to be the geometric measure of entanglement ( gme ) for any pure state @xmath22 . here",
    ", we shall be concerned with the related quantity @xmath29 , which we shall show to be a lower bound on the relative entropy of entanglement for @xmath30 .",
    "although this quantity is not , as we shall see later , an entanglement monotone for mixed states , it is a good measure of _ pure - state _ entanglement .    given the definition of entanglement for pure states just formulated , the extension to mixed states @xmath5 can be built upon pure states via the _ convex hull _ construction ( indicated by `` co '' ) , as was done for the entanglement of formation ; see ref .",
    "the essence is a minimization over all decompositions @xmath31 into pure states : @xmath32 this convex hull construction ensures that the measure gives zero for separable states ; however , in general it also complicates the task of determining mixed - state entanglement .",
    "_ illustrative examples _ :",
    "we consider several examples involving symmetric states , mostly restricting our attention to @xmath14-qubit systems .",
    "first , one can classify permutation - invariant pure states , as follows : @xmath33 as the amplitudes are all positive , one can assume that the closest separable ( equivalently , hartree ) state is of the form @xmath34 ) gives the entanglement eigenvalue for @xmath35 : @xmath36 more generally , for @xmath14 parties each a @xmath37-level system , the state @xmath38 has the entanglement eigenvalue @xmath39 now consider the totally antisymmetric state @xmath40 , defined via @xmath41 it has been shown  @xcite that @xmath42 .",
    "the generalization of the antisymmetric state to the @xmath43-partite determinant state is via  @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 in this case , it can be shown that @xmath46 .    although the above states were discussed in terms of the gme  @xcite , we shall , in the following section , show the rather surprising fact that the re of these example states , is given by the corresponding expression : @xmath47 .",
    "in bipartite systems , due to the existence of schmidt decompositions , the relative entropy of entanglement of a pure state is simply the von neumann entropy of its reduced density matrix .",
    "however , for multipartite systems there is , in general , no such decomposition , and how to calculate the relative entropy of entanglement for an arbitrary pure state remains an open question .",
    "we now connect the relative entropy of entanglement to the geometric measure of entanglement for arbitrary pure states by giving a lower bound on the former in terms of the latter or , more specifically , via the entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "let us begin with the following theorem :    _ theorem _ 1 .",
    "for any pure state @xmath30 with entanglement eigenvalue @xmath48 the quantity @xmath49 is a lower bound on the relative entropy of entanglement of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath50    _ proof _ : from the definition  ( [ eqn : er ] ) of the relative entropy of entanglement we have , for a pure state @xmath30 , @xmath51 using the concavity of the log function , we have @xmath52 and , furthermore , @xmath53 although the @xmath6 s maximizing the left- and right - hand sides are not necessarily identical .",
    "we then conclude that @xmath54 as any @xmath55 can be expanded as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 s are separable pure states , one has @xmath58 and hence we arrive at the sought result @xmath59    we wish to point out that such an inequality was previously established and exploited in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "when does the inequality becomes an equality ?",
    "the demand that eq .",

    "a corollary arises from thereom 1 which says that for any multipartite pure state @xmath30 , if one can find a separable mixed state @xmath6 such that @xmath66 then @xmath67 .",
    "this result follows directly from the fact that when the lower bound on @xmath68 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2log ] ) equals an upper bound , the relative entropy of entanglement is immediate . in all the examples we shall consider for which",
    "this lower bound is saturated , it turns out that @xmath69 is a closest separable mixed state , in which @xmath70 are separable pure states closest to @xmath30 .",
    "( the distribution @xmath71 is uniform , and can be either discrete or continuous , and @xmath70 are not necessarily mutually orthogonal . )    we now examine several illustrative states in the light of the above corollary , thus obtaining @xmath68 for each of them .",

    "( [ eqn : lambda ] ) .",
    "the upper and lower bounds on @xmath68 coincide , and hence we have that @xmath82 the closest separable mixed state @xmath83 belongs to the case ( b ) , i.e. ,  eq .  ( [ eqn : case2 ] ) . similar equalities can be established for the generalized permutation - invariant @xmath14-party @xmath37-dit states @xmath84 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : snkk ] ) .",
    "we remark that the entanglements of the symmetric states @xmath72 ( which are also known as _ dicke _ states ) have been analyzed via other approaches ; see ref .",

    "( [ eqn : sigma ] ) ] : @xmath87 then , by direct calculation one gets @xmath88 , which is identical to @xmath89 , as mentioned above . as in our previous examples , upper and lower bounds on @xmath68 coincide ,",

    "now , if we trace over one party we get a mixed @xmath226-qubit state : @xmath227 we have also given a conjecture for the relative entropy of entanglement for this mixed state .",
    "if we trace over @xmath228 parties , the reduced mixed state would be a mixture of @xmath229 [ with @xmath230 , and again we have given a conjecture for its relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "for example , if we start with @xmath231 , and trace over one party and then another , we get the sequence : @xmath232 for which we have given the corresponding relative entropies of entanglement in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : rhosnk ] ) , ( [ eqn : rho301 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rho201 ] ) .",
    "( to be precise , the second formula is a conjecture ; the others are proven . )",
    "the afore - mentioned equalities and inequalities concerning mregs usually involve only the von neumann entropy and the regularized ( i.e.  asymptotic ) relative entropy of entanglement of the pure state and its reduced density matrices .",
    "the regularized relative entropy of entanglement is defined as @xmath233 the calculation of the regularized relative entropy of entanglement is , in general , much more difficult than for the non - regularized case , and the ( in)equalities involving the regularized relative entropy of entanglement are thus difficult to check .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that @xmath234 , so we can check their weaker forms by replacing @xmath235 by @xmath68 , and the corresponding ( in)equalities by weaker inequalities .",
    "plenio and vedral  @xcite have derived a lower bound on the re of a tripartite pure state @xmath236 in terms of the the entropies and re s of the reduced states of two parties : @xmath237 where @xmath238 ( and similarly for @xmath239 and @xmath240 ) and @xmath241 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "they have further found that this lower bound is saturated by @xmath102 and @xmath242 .",
    "this raises an interesting question  @xcite : is the above lower bound ( for @xmath14-partite pure states ) saturated by the states that saturate the lower bound @xmath243 ?",
    "numerical tests seem to suggest that the plenio - vedral bound is tighter than @xmath244",
    ". if this is the case then all states that saturate the lower bound @xmath244 on @xmath68 will saturate the plenio - vedral bound .",
    "based on conjecture  1 , we can show that for @xmath245 the inequality @xmath246 is saturated , where @xmath247 is the reduced density matrix obtained from @xmath248 by tracing out the @xmath249-th party .",
    "the proof is as follows . as @xmath72 is permutation - invariant",
    ", there is no need to maximize over all parties , and we can simply take @xmath250 , obtaining the reduced state @xmath251 as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tr1 ] ) . as",
    "the corresponding function @xmath252 of @xmath253 is convex for @xmath254 $ ] , we immediately obtain from conjecture  1 that , for @xmath251 ,    @xmath255 + \\frac{k}{n}\\log_2\\frac{k}{n}+\\frac{n\\!-\\!k}{n}\\log_2\\frac{n\\!-\\!k}{n}\\\\ & = & e_{\\rm r}\\left(\\ket{s(n , k)}\\right)- s\\left(\\rho_{n\\!-\\!1;k\\!-\\!1,k}(k / n)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cre ] ) is saturated for @xmath245 .",
    "a major challenge is to extend the ideas contained in the present paper from the relative entropy of entanglement to its regularized version , the latter in fact being of wider interest than the former .",
    "the alternative way of defining the relative entropy via the optimization over ppt states may also been used , in view of the recent progress on the bipartite regularized relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "we now explore the possibility that the geometric measures can provide lower bounds on yet another entanglement measure  the entanglement of formation . if the relationship @xmath256 between the two measures of entanglement  the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath68 and the entanglement of formation @xmath257should continue to hold for _ multipartite _ states ( at least for pure states ) , and if @xmath257 should remain a convex hull construction for mixed states , then we would be able to construct a lower bound on the entanglement of formation : @xmath258 where @xmath259 and @xmath260 are such that @xmath261 .",
    "thus , @xmath262 is a lower bound on @xmath263 . by using the inequality @xmath264 ( for @xmath265 )",
    ", one further has has that @xmath266 .",
    "we remark that @xmath121 has been shown to be an entanglement monotone  @xcite , i.e. , it is not increasing under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "however , @xmath244 is _ not _ a monotone , as the following example shows . consider the bipartite pure state @xmath267 with @xmath268 , for which @xmath269 .",
    "suppose that one party makes the following measurement : @xmath270 with probability @xmath271 the output state becomes @xmath272 ; with probability @xmath273 the output state becomes @xmath274 , for which @xmath275 .",
    "for @xmath123 to be a monotone it would be necessary that @xmath276 putting in the corresponding values for the @xmath277 s and @xmath123 s , we find that this inequality is equivalent to @xmath278 as this is violated for certain values of @xmath279 with @xmath280 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : violate ] for the plot of @xmath281 , we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath123 is , in general , not a monotone .    _ note added .",
