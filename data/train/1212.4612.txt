    "<S> we investigate the zero - temperature phase diagrams of the bilayer square - lattice kugel - khomskii ( @xmath0 ) model involving entangled and singlet phases using mean - field cluster approach . </S>",
    "<S> this diagram includes interlayer singlet phase observed in fluoride k@xmath1cu@xmath2f@xmath3 and exotic entangled spin - orbital phases . for a monolayer case , realized in k@xmath2cuf@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we perform similar calculations in finite temperature and show that the alternating - orbital ferromagnet decays first to an entangled uniform ferromagnet and then to a paramagnetic phase . </S>",

    "<S> it has been shown that quantum fluctuations are enhanced near the orbital degeneracy and could suppress long - range order in the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) model @xcite , called below the @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> this model was introduced long ago for a perovskite kcuf@xmath1 @xcite , a strongly correlated system with a single hole within degenerate @xmath5 orbitals at each cu@xmath6 ion . </S>",
    "<S> kugel and khomskii showed that orbital order can be stabilized by a purely electronic superexchange mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for strongly frustrated orbital superexchange @xcite , and columnar ising - type of order is obtained @xcite in the two - dimensional quantum compass model . </S>",
    "<S> this model exhibits nontrivial symmetry properties which may be employed to perform efficient calculations for square compass clusters @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> orbital order occurs in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom , where strong coulomb interaction localizes electrons ( or holes ) and gives rise to spin - orbital superexchange @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when spin and orbital pseudospins couple to each other , their order is usually complementary  alternating orbital ( ao ) order accompanies ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin order , and ferro - orbital ( fo ) order coexists with antiferromagetic ( af ) spin order . </S>",
    "<S> however , the above goodenough - kanamori rules , see also @xcite , are not satisfied in cases when spin - orbital entanglement ( soe ) dominates @xcite , as in the spin - orbital @xmath7 model on a triangular lattice @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbital superexchange kk model for cu@xmath6 ( @xmath0 ) ions in kcuf@xmath1 with @xmath8 spins and @xmath5 orbitals described by @xmath9 pseudospin was derived from the degenerate hubbard hamiltonian with hopping @xmath10 , intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath11 and hund s exchange @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the heisenberg su(2 ) spin interactions coupled to the orbital problem by superexchange @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 depend on @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 is the bond direction . in a bilayer </S>",
    "<S> two @xmath18 planes are connected by interlayer bonds along the @xmath19 axis @xcite ( a monolayer has only bonds within a single @xmath18 plane ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 are projection operators on a triplet ( singlet ) configuration on a bond @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the orbital operators for bond direction @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> they are defined in terms of pauli matrices @xmath23 as follows : @xmath24 finally , @xmath25 is the crystal - field splitting which favors either @xmath26 ( if @xmath27 ) or @xmath28 ( if @xmath29 ) orbitals occupied by holes . </S>",
    "<S> thus the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) depends on two parameters : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbital model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) describes also cuo@xmath2 planes in la@xmath2cuo@xmath4 , where indeed @xmath32 and large @xmath33 favors holes within @xmath34 orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange between cu@xmath6 ions @xmath35 ev reproduces there the experimental value . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) for k@xmath1cu@xmath2f@xmath3 bilayer and k@xmath2cuf@xmath4 monolayer compound where nearly degenerate @xmath5 orbitals are expected . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the magnetic state of k@xmath1cu@xmath2f@xmath3 is described by the interlayer valence bond ( vb ) phase @xcite with ao configuration whereas k@xmath2cuf@xmath4 undergoes a pressure driven phase transition from the fm phase with alternating orbitals at low pressure to the af phase with with @xmath34 orbitals uniformly occupied .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approach is a single - site mean field ( mf ) approximation applied to the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it excludes any spin fluctuations so the spin projectors @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) can be replaced by their mean values depending on the assumed magnetic order . in the orbital sector </S>",
    "<S> we apply then the mf decoupling for the products @xmath38 along the axis @xmath39 : @xmath40 as order parameters we take @xmath41 and @xmath42 for a chosen site @xmath43 ( which is sufficient in orbital sector as @xmath44 ) and we assume two orbital sublattices : each neighbor of the site @xmath45 is rotated by @xmath46 in the @xmath18 plane meaning that @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistency equations can be solved analytically and the phase diagram can be obtained by comparing the ground state energies for different points in the @xmath48 plane ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one finds two classes of solutions : ( @xmath45 ) uniform orbital configurations ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) for global fo order , and ( @xmath51 ) nontrivial ao order with orbitals staggering from site to site in @xmath18 planes .     bilayer model ( 1 ) obtained with : ( a ) factorizable so mean field , and ( b ) independent , potentially non - factorizable so mean field . </S>",

    "<S> this approach has at least three advantages over the single - site mf : ( @xmath45 ) spins can fluctuate , ( @xmath51 ) elementary cell can double , and ( @xmath52 ) we can have independent spin - orbital order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the mf leads in a cluster to five order parameters : magnetic @xmath53 , orbital @xmath54 , and spin - orbital @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistency equations can be solved only numerically by iterative lanczos diagonalization of a cluster followed by the update of the mean fields ( for details see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . to capture the effect of the soe we first obtain the phase diagram assuming @xmath56 ( factorizable so mean field) see fig . [ diags](a ) and then do the calculation with true @xmath57 to get fig . </S>",

    "<S> the vb@xmath58 replaces ordinary antiferromagnet in the negative @xmath25 region of the phase diagram and involve interlayer singlets accompanied by fo@xmath58 configuration which can smoothly evolve for growing @xmath60 towards ao configuration in the vb@xmath59 being the phase observed in k@xmath1cu@xmath2f@xmath3 by manaka _ </S>",

    "<S> we explain it for realistic @xmath61 . in the pvb ( plaquette vb ) </S>",
    "<S> phase spin singlets are pointing uniformly in @xmath62 or @xmath63 direction within the cluster and the clusters form a checkerboard pattern so the unit cell is doubled . </S>",
    "<S> other phases , i.e. fm , @xmath64-af@xmath34 and @xmath65-af , exhibit long range magnetic order and can be obtained in ordinary mf approach ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    a different class of phases stems from the non - factorizable so mean field and involves soe  these are the eso , epvb and pvb - af phases shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diags](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pvb - af phase connects pvb and @xmath64-af phases by second order phase transitions and is characterized by fast changes in orbital order and appearance of global magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the eso phase has no magnetization and weak fo order . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath25 grows , the eso phase does change continuously into the epvb configuration , being an entangled precursor of the pvb phase with highly non - uniform af magnetization . as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , both eso and epvb are characterized by strong on - site soe defined as @xmath66 . using </S>",
    "<S> the same cluster mf approach as above one can easily study the properties of the kk model for a single layer at zero and finite temperature @xmath67 . at @xmath68 one </S>",

    "<S> it involves only af and pvb phases and the vb@xmath58 is replaced for af@xmath58 in the absence of the second layer . </S>",
    "<S> the pvb area is strongly elongated in the horizontal directions and caps af@xmath58 down to @xmath69 where surprizingly one finds a narrow stripe of a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> this stripe separates pvb from fm@xmath58 phase ( fm phase with fo@xmath58 order ) , and shows that frustration in a single layer system is bigger than in a bilayer one where paramagnetizm is absent in @xmath68 .    in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diags2](b ) we show the thermal evolution of spin and orbital order parameters and soe for a point @xmath70 lying in the fm area of the monolayer phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution involves passage through the fm@xmath58 phase and ends in the pm phase . </S>",
    "<S> the fm magnetization @xmath71 exhibits critical behavior staying close to @xmath72 in the fm phase and dropping quickly to zero at the fm@xmath58-pm phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital @xmath73 show inverse bifurcation at the fm - fm@xmath58 phase transition being the end of the ao order but remain non - zero in the paramagnet which is induced by finite @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site soe represented by @xmath74 are small everywhere but in fm@xmath58 they become relatively large which lets us think of fm@xmath58 as an entangled phase . </S>",
