    "a plethora of observational evidences ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein and @xcite for recent _ planck _ results ) makes the picture of a spatially flat universe with a subcritical matter content undergoing accelerated expansion a fully accepted paradigm of modern cosmology .",
    "what is complementing the cosmic budget and driving the cosmic speed up remains however still largely unknown .",
    "contrary to what typically happens , the problem here is not the absence of a viable solution , but rather the presence of too many candidates playing the game of thrones , with no contenders being so unequivocally superior to the other to be awarded the dark energy crown .",
    "most of the proposed mechanisms , from the classic cosmological constant to dynamical dark energy fluids , from scalar fields with a suitable potential to modified gravity theories ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) , are indeed able to nicely fit data probing the background evolution of the cosmos .",
    "although they also make distinct predictions on the growth of perturbations , this latter quantity can still not be traced well enough by the presently available data to allow for a definitive discrimination .    as also witnessed by the conclusions of the dark energy task force report",
    "@xcite , weak gravitational lensing ( also referred to , in the following , as cosmic shear ) has emerged as the most promising tool to put some order in the chaotic accumulation of up - to - now viable models .",
    "the cosmic shear power spectrum is indeed able to probe both the expansion rate and the growth of perturbations @xcite thus offering a potentially unique tool to severely constrain cosmological parameters and discriminate among theoretical models .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that great efforts have been recently invested in this field on both theoretical studies and observational resources , with many future surveys being planned ( e.g. , panstarrs , des , lsst and euclid ) .",
    "the power of weak lensing as a gravity probe risks however to be strongly diminished by systematic uncertainties , which can cooperate to turn the observed signal into an unfaithful realization of the underlying cosmic one .",
    "such systematics may come from both theoretical issues ( such as the linear to nonlinear mapping of the matter power spectrum and the intrinsic alignment of source galaxies ) and observationally related problems ( as , e.g. ,",
    "the mismatch between the actual redshift distribution and the one inferred from photo-@xmath0 and the shear measurement method ) . a central role in forecasting the precision a future survey can achieve on the cosmological parameters is therefore played by the understanding of the impact of systematics on the cosmological parameters estimation .",
    "moreover , such an analysis would help in identifying which kind of systematics drives the bias on the parameters of interest , thus helping in fixing both the survey strategy and instrumental setup .    motivated by this consideration , different strategies have been proposed to address this issue .",
    "on one hand , much work has been dedicated to estimate the impact of systematics on the shear signal ; e.g. , @xcite demonstrated how easy it is for systematics to produce spurious b - modes and make the measured lensing e - modes departing from the actual ones .",
    "this motivated @xcite to work out a method for testing for the presence of systematics and to apply it to the sdss galaxy - galaxy weak lensing data .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite , imperfect modelling of the psf soon appeared to be one of the most likely source of systematics , so that both @xcite and @xcite examined to what accuracy the psf must be modelled in order to not bias the shear signal .",
    "since the shear field is reconstructed from the observed shape of galaxies , it is clear that systematics in shape measurement play a significant role as discussed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "all these works are mainly concerned with the impact of systematics on the weak lensing power spectrum , but do not perform a detailed analysis of how they propagate to bias the estimate of cosmological parameters .",
    "not surprisingly , such an issue has then been carefully addressed in the literature under different assumptions about the systematics considered and about their modelling @xcite .",
    "of particular interest for our aim is the work of amara & refregier ( 2008 , hereafter ar08 ) who have presented a fisher matrix analysis to infer the bias on the dark energy equation of state due to the mismatch between theoretical and observed cosmic shear power spectrum caused by the systematics term .",
    "a similar but more detailed analysis has also been carried out in @xcite , where a wider set of sources has been taken into account .",
    "both these works , however , assume a parameterized analytical expression for the systematics power spectrum , so that their results hold true only as far as this a priori description is deemed as reliable . a significant step forward has been recently represented by the work of massey et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter m13 ) where an analytical formalism has been developed to propagate observational uncertainties ( coming from errors in shape measurement , psf correction and ccd defects ) on the cosmic shear power spectrum . a fisher matrix analysis",
    "is then used to set requirements on the amplitude of systematics asking that they do not spoil down the efficiency of the survey in correctly constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "these results are then used as an input to the analysis of @xcite where a list of requirements on the different systematics is presented .",
    "most of the works quoted above are mainly concerned with quantifying how systematics alter the cosmic shear power spectrum and hence bias the cosmological parameter determination .",
    "although a careful control of the different sources can help reducing systematics , one should also be ready to deal with the possibility that they could not be completely removed .",
    "as such , a model for their power spectrum should be added to the lensing one in the likelihood analysis in order to reduce the bias on the cosmological parameters .",
    "such a model would likely be parametrized by a set of nuisance parameters which inevitably degrade the precision in the estimate of the cosmological ones . finding a compromise between reducing the bias and improving",
    "the precision is a difficult task that is worth to be investigated .",
    "the first steps to be addressed to achieve this goal are :    * find a method to propagate systematics ( originating from , e.g. , shape measurement and imperfect psf modelling ) on the finally observed power spectrum ; + * take into account both the survey setup ( psf , filter transmission curve , magnitude limit ) and the properties ( size and spectral energy distribution ) of the source galaxies ; + * correctly describe the evolution with redshift of the systematics power spectrum ; + * model the angular scale dependence of the deviations of the observed shear power spectrum from the lensing one .",
    "the method we present here aims at fulfilling the above four requirements under very general conditions . in order to be as general as possible",
    ", we do not make any assumption about the sources of systematics , but only assume that their effect on the shear estimate can be described as a first order deviation as usually assumed in the literature @xcite .",
    "although our method is fully general , we explicitly implement it for the euclid survey @xcite using realistic assumptions for both the filter transmission curve and psf wavelength dependence .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we show how systematics can be included in the computation of the cosmic shear power spectrum and describe the multiplicative and additive bias .",
    "a general formalism for computing these two terms is presented in sect.3 , while the particular case of the planned euclid survey is considered in sect.4 , where we make a step - by - step derivation of the systematics power spectrum .",
    "its impact on the determination of the cosmological parameters is investigated in sect.5 through a markov chain monte carlo likelihood analysis of mock datasets for two different systematics power spectra .",
    "a summary of the results and some further considerations are given in the concluding sect.6 , while some supplementary material is presented in appendices a and b.",
    "the matter distribution along the line of a sight to a given source alters the shape of the image due to the magnifying effect of the convergence field @xmath1 and the change in the ellipticity due to the shear @xmath2 .",
    "since neither the intrinsic size nor the source ellipticity are known , one can only resort to statistical methods to get an estimate of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to this end ,",
    "one first quantifies the shape of an image introducing the second order moments @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are cartesian coordinates with origin in the galaxy centre and @xmath5 is the 2d energy distribution normalized in such a way that :    @xmath6    @xmath7    with @xmath8 the intensity profile in a waveband with transmission function @xmath9 and @xmath10 the total flux in that filter .    rather than directly using second order moments , it is quite more common to use the complex ellipticity @xmath11 and the size @xmath12 defined as ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath13    @xmath14    with @xmath15 cylindrical coordinates in the image plane .",
    "these quantities can also be expressed in terms of the moments as    @xmath16    @xmath17    the galaxy shape we observe is the outcome of the lensing effect by the intervening matter along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , we do not directly record the image as it is , but after the convolution with the point spread function ( psf ) of the observational setup .",
    "in the weak lensing limit @xmath18 , the image shape parameters , after the distortion due to lensing and the psf convolution , then read    @xmath19    @xmath20    where we used the subscript @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) to denote quantities referred to the galaxy after the effect of lensing ( the psf ) . since the image we observe is obtained by collecting photons with different wavelengths , we do not actually measure the wavelength dependent ellipticity and size , but rather their values after integration over the filter waveband . however , it is easy to show that the above relations equally hold for the integrated quantities so that , hereafter , we will drop the @xmath23-dependence and use @xmath24 to denote the wavelength integrated ellipticity and size .",
    "eqs.([eq : omegashearpsf])-([eq : epsshearpsf ] ) can be combined into a single relation for the reduced shear @xmath25 . to this end , it is convenient to introduce the following auxiliary quantity    @xmath26    and note that ( see appendix a ) the transformation rules for @xmath27 under the effect of shear and psf convolution read    @xmath28    @xmath29    where quantities with the @xmath30 subscript refer to the galaxy before the effect of lensing and psf convolution and hereafter we define @xmath31 .",
    "it is then only a matter of algebra to get    @xmath32    eq.([eq : gtrue ] ) makes a step further towards the estimate of the reduced shear @xmath33 , but can not still be used because of the term @xmath34 which can not be observationally measured .",
    "moreover , since shape measurement methods are not perfect , the observed values @xmath35 could also differ from the actual ones , @xmath27 . on the other hand , as we will show later , in order to compute the psf shape parameters , we need to know not only the psf intensity profile , but also the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxy .",
    "should this latter not be exactly known , both @xmath36 must be replaced by some estimate @xmath37 which is obtained by integrating the psf intensity profile over @xmath23 with a different sed ( for instance , the sed of the nearby stars used to infer the psf profile ) . neglecting the intrinsic ellipticity @xmath34 ( since averages to zero ) and explicitly taking into account the difference between the true and estimated psf shape parameters ,",
    "we then obtain the following reduced shear estimator :    @xmath38    in order to estimate the difference between the actual reduced shear @xmath33 and the estimated one @xmath39 , we will first assume that the following linear relations hold :    @xmath40    @xmath41    although eqs.([eq : shapebias ] ) and ( [ eq : psfbias ] ) extend only to first order , they are actually well motivated .",
    "indeed , all the shape measurement codes ( see , e.g. , the list in @xcite ) are designed in such a way to reduce as much as possible the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath27 so that a linear relation is a good approximation . following the literature , we will refer to @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the shape measurement multiplicative and additive bias , respectively . on the other hand , we will show later that the linear parametrization given by eq.([eq : psfbias ] ) also provides an excellent approximation for the relation among the guessed and actual psf shape parameters for most cases of practical interest .",
    "inserting eqs.([eq : shapebias ] ) and ( [ eq : psfbias ] ) into eq.([eq : gobs ] ) , using the weak lensing limit of eqs.([eq : xiobs])-([eq : omegaobs ] ) and averaging over a large sample of galaxies , we finally get :    @xmath44    with    @xmath45    @xmath46    which we will refer to as the multiplicative and additive bias , respectively .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath47 are obtained by averaging over the properties of a sample of galaxies centred on the position in the sky where the shear has to be estimated . since the values of @xmath47 for",
    "each individual system depend on the galaxy properties ( structural parameters and sed ) , eqs.([eq : defmulbias ] ) and ( [ eq : defaddbias ] ) actually provides only the first order description of the distribution of @xmath47 values .",
    "one should , however , consider also the width of the distribution since the wide range in galaxy properties can lead to a non negligible spread of the individual values around the mean ones given by eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) above .",
    "although eq.([eq : gobsvsgtrue ] ) has been obtained assuming a particular shear estimator , this expression is actually quite general . indeed , whatever is the estimator used , the observed shear will typically differ from its actual value because of measurement errors and uncontrolled systematics .",
    "should the reconstruction method be efficient enough , one can postulate a simple linear relation between the true and observed values so that we set @xcite    @xmath48 \\gamma_{lens}(\\theta , z ) + \\gamma_{add}(\\theta , z ) \\label{eq : gammaobs}\\ ] ]    for the observed shear of a galaxy at redshift @xmath0 and with position on the sky given by @xmath49 .",
    "eq.([eq : gammaobs ] ) tells us that the observed shear is related to the one due to the lensing effect , denoted @xmath50 , through the multiplicative bias @xmath51 and the additive bias @xmath52 .",
    "note that we are here assuming that the multiplicative bias does not depend on the position on the sky which is a quite good approximation considering that @xmath53 .",
    "although eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) explicitly refers to the reduced shear @xmath33 , in the weak lensing limit , @xmath54 so that @xmath55 with great care .",
    "we can therefore set @xmath56 and @xmath57 and use the above relations to get an estimate of the multiplicative and additive bias .    in order to constrain cosmological parameters ,",
    "one is actually not interested to the shear value for single galaxies and how it changes with position and redshift , but rather to its power spectrum .",
    "we therefore first define the real space correlation functions :    @xmath58    and then compute the power spectrum as :    @xmath59 } \\label{eq : cldef}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the bessel function of order @xmath61 . using eq.([eq : gammaobs ] ) and assuming that the additive systematic term is uncorrelated with the signal , one straightforwardly gets :    @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\langle \\gamma_{i , lens}(\\theta , z ) \\gamma_{i , lens}(\\theta + \\phi , z^{\\prime } ) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\langle \\gamma_{i , add}(\\theta , z ) \\gamma_{i , add}(\\theta+ \\phi , z^{\\prime } ) \\rangle \\ , \\label{eq : gammacorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that it is only a matter of trivial algebra to substitute this relation into the definition ( [ eq : defxipm ] ) and then the result into eq.([eq : cldef ] ) to finally obtain :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the observed power spectrum between two bins @xmath65 centred on @xmath66 , respectively , @xmath67 the lensing contribution ( evaluated as described in , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath68 the correction due to the multiplicative bias , and @xmath69 the term originating from the additive systematics . in order to compute the observed power spectrum in eq.([eq : clend ] ) , we need a way to estimate both the multiplicative bias @xmath70 and the additive bias power spectrum @xmath71 which we will do in the next section .    as a final remark ,",
    "we warn the reader that , here , we have not taken into account corrections to the theoretical power spectrum due to the intrinsic alignment of the galaxies .",
    "while this can be done ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , one should introduce further unknown parameters thus weakening the constraints on the cosmological parameters and increasing possible degeneracies among them . since we are interested in checking the impact of neglecting systematics when forecasting the accuracy on model parameters , we prefer to not include the intrinsic alignment terms in order to consider the most favourable case .",
    "let us now consider how to estimate the @xmath47 in a given position on the sky .",
    "eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) show that this is only possible if one preliminary knows the set of quantities which we briefly discuss below .",
    "these quantities are related to the measurement method adopted and the characteristics of the images one is dealing with .",
    "ideally , one should therefore use end - to - end simulations to take into account all the features of both the image analysis pipeline and the ellipticity determination software .",
    "this is the underlying philosophy inspiring the great challenges @xcite which have , however , not yet included all the realistic noise properties so that the results should be taken with some care .    a correct breakdown of the different source terms contributing to the shear measurement bias @xcite can , however , help in finding out how the mutiplicative and additive bias should scale with the galaxy size .",
    "according to @xcite , three terms mainly contribute to the shear measurement systematics , namely imperfect psf modelling , imperfect correction for detector effects and shape measurement bias . using a taylor expansion based on moments ,",
    "they get averaged over many galaxies , but we have here simplified their formulae to highlight how the shear measurement bias scales with the galaxy size . ] @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 actually refer to the errors in estimate of @xmath76 and @xmath77 depend on the errors on the psf shape parameters .",
    "a different scaling with the galaxy size @xmath78 has , however , been found by @xcite who , based on using the _ lensfit _ code @xcite on simulated images reproducing the characteristics of the cfhtlens survey @xcite , have found a negligible additive bias and a multiplicative bias scaling as @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the s / n ratio and @xmath81 a typical galaxy size quantity .",
    "a further contribution to the shear measurement bias can also come from the so called _ noise bias _",
    "@xcite which introduces a deviation of the measured moments from the actual one which correlates with the galaxy ellipticity .",
    "although some significant steps have been done towards understanding how the shear measurement bias can be modelled , one do expect that the detailed dependence of noise will change according to which shape measurement method one is using with moment - based methods likely giving different scalings than fitting - based algorithms .",
    "we can nevertheless note that , notwithstanding the details of the shape measurement process , the higher is the s / n ratio of the galaxy and the larger is its size compared to the psf one , the closer will the inferred shear be to the intrinsic one .",
    "we can therefore qualitatively model the shear measurement bias parameters as :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 stands for one of the quantities @xmath84 , @xmath85 is scaling quantity and @xmath86 are positive numbers fixing the slope of the dependence on the size and @xmath87 ratio . as we will show later , while we have an estimate of the galaxy @xmath88 parameter",
    ", we do not know how to set the @xmath87 ratio so that , in this preliminary analysis , we will fix @xmath89 for all the @xmath84 cases .",
    "we are nevertheless left with 12 parameters is a complex number , @xmath90 are actually two components quantities thus leading to @xmath91 quantities to be fixed .",
    "each of them is set assigning the three parameters @xmath92 thus leading to a total of @xmath93 parameters . ] thus allowing us to explore still a wide range of possibilities .",
    "compared to the above quoted scaling formulae , eq.([eq : biasscaling ] ) typically gives larger biases ( unless @xmath94 is unrealistically large ) for a given galaxy size , while a further downgrading is introduced because of neglecting the @xmath87 dependence . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that our results would overestimate the impact of bias thus making us err on the conservative side .",
    "eq.([eq : biasscaling ] ) is , by definition , only an approximation of how the bias depends on the galaxy properties . as such",
    ", it will be affected by a given scatter @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 the fractional uncertainty ) thus forcing us to introduce six more parameters . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the actual @xmath83 value for a galaxy with given @xmath97 values may be extracted from a normal distribution centred on @xmath83 and with variance @xmath98 .",
    "although simplified , such an approach allows us to realistically estimate the multiplicative and additive bias due to the imperfect recovery of the shear .      in order to understand why the estimated psf @xmath37 can be different from the actual ones @xmath36 , it is worth first remembering that these latter are defined as :    @xmath100    @xmath101    where the @xmath23-dependent shape parameters only depend on the psf intensity profile and wavelength dependence , while @xmath102 and @xmath9 are the galaxy dependent sed and the filter transmission curve",
    "it is worth noting that such a coupling between the psf and galaxy sed is a consequence of the large width of the euclid filter . indeed",
    ", should the filter be narrow , one could neglect the @xmath23 dependence of the psf and hence avoid the integration .",
    "such an effect was first quantified in @xcite , but here we make a step further explicitly propagating it to the systematics power spectrum considering the actual galaxy seds .    the presence of the @xmath102 term in eqs.([eq : xipsf])-([eq : omegapsf ] ) tells us that errors in the estimate of the psf shape parameters can also come from an imperfect determination of the galaxy sed . actually , one can assume that the intensity profile and wavelength dependence of the psf are very well known so that the main error on the psf indeed comes from those on the sed . in order to simulate this effect",
    ", we will consider two kind of errors .",
    "first , we consider the optimistic case that the shape of the sed has been well determined , while a possible redshift mismatch is left with @xmath103 randomly extracted from a gaussian distribution centred on @xmath104 and variance @xmath105 and @xmath0 the actual redshift . as a pessimistic case ,",
    "we assume that also the shape of the sed has been wrongly estimated . to mimic such errors ,",
    "we randomly shift by a quantity of order @xmath106 the age of both the bulge and disk so that the colors are approximately the same as expected from a typical photo-@xmath0 code .",
    "we denote with @xmath37 the psf shape parameters estimated with the wrong sed and fit eqs.([eq : psfbias ] ) for the relation among true and guessed psf values .",
    "it turns out that , within a very good approximation , we can set @xmath107 , while the additive terms @xmath108 depend on the redshift bin and the sed errors .",
    "we have , moreover , checked that the optimistic approach leads to @xmath108 values which are orders of magnitude smaller than the pessimistic model .",
    "we therefore consider only this second option in the following in order to be safely conservative . finally , to estimate the wavelength dependent psf shape parameters , we have relied on the simulated psf model worked out by the euclid consortium ( j. amiaux , private communication ) on the basis of the instrumental setup ( telescope and ccd camera ) which will be actually used on - board the satellite .",
    "we can therefore be confident that our treatment of the psf moments is fully realistic .",
    "the two previous paragraphs have demonstrated that the multiplicative and additive bias @xmath47 depend on the properties of the galaxy used to infer the shear estimate . in particular , the size and the luminosity ( through its impact on the @xmath87 ratio ) determine @xmath84 , while @xmath99 are set by the galaxy sed .",
    "we have therefore generated a catalog of two components ( bulge+disk ) galaxies which can be used as input for the estimate of @xmath47 according to the procedure sketched below .    1 .",
    "pick up a galaxy from the catalog and estimate the intrinsic shape parameters @xmath109 from the bulge+disk intensity profile and psf ones @xmath36 according to its composite sed .",
    "+ 2 .   set the shear measurement parameters @xmath110 and",
    "use eq.([eq : biasscaling ] ) and the @xmath111 value to estimate both the mean and the variance of @xmath84 .",
    "+ 3 .   set @xmath112 for the given galaxy by randomly sampling from a gaussian distribution with mean and variance computed above .",
    "+ 4 .   set the psf bias parameters @xmath99 randomly sampling from a gaussian distribution with mean and variance estimated as described in sect.4.2 .",
    "repeat steps ( i)-(iv ) for @xmath113 galaxies and finally estimate @xmath47 averaging over the sample values .",
    "+    the number of @xmath113 of galaxies should ideally be very large in order to accurately trace the distribution of the galaxy properties .",
    "however , in a realistic application , @xmath113 is limited by the number density of the survey and the need to avoid averaging over too large areas in order to not smooth a spatially varying shear signal . for a survey with number density @xmath114",
    ", one has to average over an area of radius @xmath115 so that the power spectrum can not be estimated for scales larger than @xmath116 .",
    "if we set @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we get @xmath119 leading to @xmath120 . actually , since we are interested in tomography , we bin galaxies in redshift according to the binning reported in table [ tab : bins ] so that @xmath114 will be smaller than the quoted value in the highest redshift bins .",
    "we therefore set @xmath121 so that @xmath122 which is still reassuringly large also for unrealistically small @xmath114 values in the highest @xmath0 bins .",
    "as a final caveat , we warn the reader that we have relied up to now on unweighted moments to derive eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) . actually , unweighted moments have formally infinite noise ( hence @xmath123 ) requiring to use weighted moments .",
    "this introduces a further bias due to the galaxy colour gradients @xcite which is not explicitly accounted for in our multiplicative and additive bias estimate .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the colour gradient bias can be corrected for leaving a residual effect that can be modelled as a linear perturbation of the observed shape parameters and hence still as in our eqs.([eq : shapebias ] ) .",
    "we therefore argue that eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) can still be considered approximately valid after calibrating the colour gradient bias .",
    ".redshift binning used in our analysis .",
    "the redshift range of every bin is chosen in such a way that each bin contains 10% of the galaxies observed by the survey . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a first case , we consider the @xmath124cdm model .",
    "we first check that we recover the fiducial cosmological parameters when fitting a mock dataset without systematics ( _ no sys _ in the following ) , e.g. obtained setting both the multiplicative bias and the power spectrum of the additive systematics to zero .",
    "we then run two further cases adding the sysa and sysb systematics to the lensing power spectra before generating the mock datasets .",
    "fig.[fig : 1dplot ] shows the constraints on the most relevant cosmological parameters .",
    "as it can be noticed , we correctly recover the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters when no systematics are present , while results are clearly biased in the other cases considered .",
    "furthermore , likelihood profiles appear to be slightly non - gaussian in some cases , specially for the derived parameters ( @xmath125 , matter and dark energy density respectively ) . as a way to quantify the observed bias",
    ", we report in table[tab : shiftlcdm ] the mean marginalized values and the standard deviations for the most relevant parameters and the corresponding relative bias @xmath126 where @xmath127 are the shift from the fiducial model and the standard deviation , respectively .",
    "we underline here that due to the slight non - gaussianity of the likelihood distributions , the standard deviations do not necessarily correspond to the 68% c.l . bounds .",
    "different definitions of the uncertainty @xmath128 might thus lead to slightly different quantifications of the bias .",
    "however , we verified these changes do not affect our overall conclusions .",
    "following m13 , we can deem as _ biased _ a parameter if @xmath126 exceeds the value @xmath129 because of the presence of systematics .",
    "as table[tab : shiftlcdm ] shows , the derived parameters @xmath130 are severely biased for both the sysa and sysb cases , while the amplitude @xmath131 of the perturbations is shifted by a small but yet non - negligible amount . on the contrary , both the slope of the primordial power spectrum @xmath132 and the hubble constant @xmath133 do not significantly shift from the fiducial value , so that their determination is robust against the impact of systematics . although we used a different approach to estimate @xmath126 , it is nevertheless worth noting that this conclusion is consistent with that of m13 .",
    "they indeed find that , in order for the systematics to not bias the estimate of cosmological parameters , the two following conditions must be fulfilled :    @xmath134    having defined    @xmath135    @xmath136    where the sum runs over the different bins combinations reduces in our case to a simple average over the redshift bins . ] and @xmath137 .",
    "for the sysa model , we get    @xmath138    while it is    @xmath139    for the sysb systematics . in both cases ,",
    "the multiplicative bias is larger than the m13 limit , confiming that the bias on cosmological parameters is expected also from this kind of criterion .",
    "furthermore , such a conclusion is also qualitatively consistent with ar08 suggesting that it is the multiplicative systematics which plays the most important role in biasing the estimate of cosmological parameters .",
    "one could naively be surprised that @xmath126 takes such large values considering that , for both systematics models , the condition on @xmath140 is fulfilled , while the one on @xmath141 is only mildly violated .",
    "however , one should be aware that the m13 limits have been obtained based on a fisher matrix approach . since this method is known to underestimate the limits on the bias , it is not surprising that our mcmc fitting of mock ( but yet realistic ) data gives larger bias values .",
    "we therefore recommend to rely on such a method to rederive conservative limits on the @xmath142 parameters , which is outside our aims here .    as a second test",
    ", we now analyze the bias on cosmological parameters for a @xmath143cdm model , allowing the dark energy equation of state to deviate from the constant cosmological constant value @xmath144 using the cpl parametrization .",
    "fig.[fig : cplplot ] shows the constraints on the most relevant cosmological parameters , while table[tab : shiftwzwa ] shows the shifts between the recovered parameters and the input fiducial model .",
    "while this is consistent with the above expectations based on the @xmath145 values , it is worth noticing how the shifts are now significantly larger than in the @xmath124cdm case .",
    "this is due to the fact that increasing the number of free parameters allows a better fit of the mock datasets that include systematics .",
    "leaving @xmath146 and @xmath147 free to vary does in fact improve the best fit @xmath148 shown in table[tab : like ]",
    ". however , this has the downside that , due to the correlations between parameters , best fitting models can be determined by extremely more biased cosmological parameters .",
    "cosmic shear tomography has emerged as one of the most promising ways to help cosmologists to end the debate on whether gr based quintessence models or modified gravity scenarios are the best candidate to solve the dark energy rebus .",
    "the possibility to probe both the background evolution and the growth of structures makes the shear power spectrum an ideal tool to break the degeneracies between the two competing proposals .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to be sure that nothing intervenes to degrade this possibility .",
    "the next - to - come weak lensing surveys are designed to reduce to a negligible level the statistical errors so that the main remaining task is to take care of the systematics .",
    "great efforts are therefore ongoing to both determine which are the main sources of systematics and to investigate their impact on the estimation of the cosmological parameters .    as a preliminary but yet fundamental step ,",
    "we have here presented a general formalism to make a step - by - step derivation of the multiplicative bias and of the additive systematics power spectra originating from shape measurement errors and uncertainties on the psf reconstruction . moreover",
    ", the proposed algorithm explicitly takes into account the properties of the target galaxies so that the redshift evolution of the systematics is consistently computed rather than imposed a priori . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that the systematics power spectra are inferred from the survey design ( entering through the psf wavelength dependence and filter transmission curve ) and the galaxies photometric properties .",
    "two quite general assumptions are at the core of our procedure .",
    "first , we have assumed that both the reconstructed psf and measured galaxy shape moments can be related to the actual ones by linear relations ( [ eq : shapebias ] ) and ( [ eq : psfbias ] ) . rather than getting lost in the details of the psf reconstruction procedure and shape measurement algorithm , we have parameterized all these systematics in the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath99 which can be set a posteriori once they have been determined ( based on , e.g. , a comparison with simulations ) for the given measurement process .",
    "for the application presented in this work , we have estimated the @xmath99 parameters considering the impact of the psf wavelength dependence , while @xmath84 have been given as function of the @xmath87 and apparent magnitude of the target galaxy .",
    "although the details of our choice could be questioned , we are nevertheless confident that our algorithm offers the unique possibility to estimate the amplitude of the systematics and its redshift evolution according to the features of the different players entering the game hence representing a significant step forward towards a fully realistic description of these fundamental aspect of the cosmic shear analysis .",
    "a possible caveat is represented by the use of unweighted moments in the derivation of eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) .",
    "in fact , in order to increase the s / n , one rather usually measures weighted moments ; thus , the lensing shape transforms we have started from are not valid anymore in this case .",
    "this is actually not a serious shortcomings for our derivation .",
    "indeed , as far as the relation between weighted and unweighted moments can be roughly approximated as linear , one can still use eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) provided @xmath84 are consistently redefined .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case using a gaussian weight function and varying its size with respect to the galaxy half light radius . for a wide range of galaxy properties and relative size",
    ", we indeed find a linear relation between weighted and unweighted moments so that we are confident that eqs.([eq : defmulbias])-([eq : defaddbias ] ) and hence our algorithm for the systematics amplitude derivation can be safely trusted upon .",
    "while our method represents a step forward for what concerns the amplitude of the systematics , the shape of their scale profile still remains to be set by hand . in order to parameterize our ignorance of this issue ,",
    "we have proposed a multigaussian expansion allowing us to consistently derive the additive power spectra provided the typical scale of the systematics and the coefficients of the expansion are set .",
    "although still a large degree of arbitrariness is left , this approach nevertheless allows to mimic a wide set of shape profiles , preserving a link with some quantities which can be inferred from an analysis of the possible sources of systematics . in order to move forward",
    ", one must unavoidably rely on simulations looking for a correlation of the shape measurement bias parameters @xmath84 with the properties of the galaxy population .",
    "let us assume , for instance , that they correlate with the color of the galaxy and hence with the morphology ( early - type galaxies being typically redder than late - type ones ) .",
    "since clustering properties of ellipticals are different from those of spiral ones , one could then expect that the power spectrum of this kind of systematics is somewhat related to the galaxy ones , thus gaining a first hint on its shape profile .",
    "unfortunately , a similar analysis is unavailable at the moment so that we are forced to leave free the coefficient of our multigaussian expansion .",
    "the reliable procedure presented here to compute the systematics power spectrum provides us the necessary input to investigate their impact on the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "two effects are actually possible .",
    "although much effort will be dedicated in future surveys to reduce as much as possible the sources of systematics , it is nevertheless possible that some of them will go undetected , so that the observed shear power spectra differ from the underlying cosmological one .",
    "one can therefore wonder to which extent fitting the data assuming that no systematics are present can bias the cosmological parameters . this is the point we have addressed here performing an mcmc analysis on mock data with and without added systematics .",
    "we find that the best fit models trace the data at low multipoles , but poorly fits the high @xmath149 s , thus leading to very large @xmath148 values .",
    "this result suggests that a possible signature of the systematics is represented by the large @xmath148 values due to the poor performance of the best fit models at high multipoles , i.e. over a range where statistical errors are quite small , although the same effect could also be provided rather by the need of a different theoretical model to describe the data .",
    "one could , however , decide to still trust the inferred cosmological parameters assuming that the large @xmath148 is only a consequence of the residual systematics .",
    "such a choice will however lead to strongly biased constraints with the recovered parameters shifting from the input one many times the @xmath150 error .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results in the literature ( in particular with the outcomes of the m13 analysis ) which is a reassuring test considering we have relied on a different and ameliorated derivation of the systematics multiplicative bias and additive power spectra and a mcmc fit to mock data instead of a fisher matrix analysis .    as a further improvement to the procedure presented in this paper",
    ", one could be less optimistic and admit that some undetected systematics are present in the data .",
    "the point is now how to model them and to which extent fitting for their corresponding parameters degrades the constraints on the cosmological ones . in a sense",
    ", this is a complementary question to the previous one .",
    "we are now no more concerned in the bias , but rather in the accuracy . to this end",
    ", one should first find an analytical description of the systematics multiplicative term and additive power spectra .",
    "the procedure we have presented allows to work out a large range of realistic @xmath51 and @xmath69 functions which can drive the choice of the better way to model the systematics . as fig.[fig : psplots ] shows , the previous proposed parameterization available in the literature are unable to correctly mimic the systematics power spectra so that their use should be avoided . on the contrary",
    ", a more reliable strategy would be to generate a large set of @xmath51 and @xmath69 functions and fit them with an analytical approximation flexible enough to mimic them , but with not too many parameters in order to avoid a severe weakening of the accuracy on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this will be subject of a forthcoming publication .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we would like to draw the weak lensing community attention on the need for a realistic derivation of the systematics power spectra .",
    "notwithstanding which method is used to investigate the bias on the cosmological parameters ( should it be based on a fisher matrix approach or a mcmc fitting of mock data ) , the main point is to fully take into account all the players entering the game .",
    "as we have shown here , this means to realistically describe not only the shape measurement bias and the psf reconstruction errors , but also the distribution and the evolution with redshift of the galaxy properties .",
    "it is only a combined analysis of all these factors which can finally lead us to avoid the most dangerous pitfalls undermining the potential of cosmic shear to put an end to the quintessence vs modified gravity fight for the dark energy throne .",

    "these are slightly different from the conventional ones @xmath24 so that we find it useful to briefly sketch the derivation of the effect of lensing , psf convolution and @xmath23 integration in the moments space and find out how the measurable values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 relate to the reduced shear .",

    "the inverse mapping will be    @xmath159    while the area elements transforms as @xmath160 .",
    "because of the achromatic nature of the lensing phenomenon , the liouville theorem ensures that the 2d energy distribution is conserved so that @xmath161 . using this relation and the above geometric transformations , it is then possible to get the following rule for the moments :    @xmath162    so that it is only a matter of algebra to finally get    @xmath163    @xmath164    which , for @xmath165 , indeed reduce to eqs.([eq : xiwl])-([eq : omwl ] ) .      for a given wavelength @xmath23 ,",
    "the energy distribution @xmath166 of a galaxy after convolution with a @xmath23-dependent psf with energy distribution @xmath167 reads :    @xmath168    in the moments space , the convolution becomes a linear operation so that the following relation holds :    @xmath169    where , without loss of generality , we have assumed that , at each given @xmath23 , the psf is centred on the galaxy .",
    "it is then not surprising that the ellipticity and size of the galaxy after convolution will be simply given by :    @xmath170    @xmath171    note that , because of the @xmath23 dependence , the impact of the psf will be different at different wavelengths .      in common applications ,",
    "the galaxy is imaged through a broadband filter so that what one measure is the wavelength integrated energy distribution , i.e. the intensity @xmath8 defined above .",

    "it is then easy to get :    @xmath179    @xmath180    thanks to the linearity of the @xmath23 integration .",

    "<S> , we derive analytical expressions for the multiplicative and additive bias , showing how these terms depend not only on the shape measurement errors , but also on the properties of the source galaxies ( namely , size , magnitude and spectral energy distribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to compute the amplitude of the systematics power spectrum and its scaling with redshift , while we propose a multigaussian expansion to model in a non - parametric way its angular scale dependence . </S>",
    "<S> our method allows to self - consistently propagate the systematics uncertainties to the finally observed shear power spectrum , thus allowing us to quantify the departures from the actual spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even a modest level of systematics can induce non - negligible deviations , thus leading to a significant bias on the recovered cosmological parameters .    </S>",
