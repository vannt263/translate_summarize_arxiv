    "a permutation @xmath8 avoids the barred pattern @xmath1 if each instance of a not - necessarily - consecutive 542 pattern in @xmath8 is part of a 31542 pattern in @xmath8 .",
    "lara pudwell @xcite introduces an automated method to produce `` prefix enumeration schemes '' for permutations avoiding a set of one or more barred patterns .",
    "such a scheme , if found , translates to a recurrence to count the corresponding avoiders . for single patterns of length 5 with 2 bars",
    ", she notes a success rate of @xmath9 .",
    "the title pattern is among the failures but pudwell observes @xcite that the counting sequence for this pattern appears to be http://oeis.org/a047970 [ ] in the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite .",
    "here we confirm this conjecture .",
    "the definition of a047970 is @xmath10 , which is equivalent to @xmath11 , where @xmath7 is the stirling partition number .",
    "( this equivalence is not entirely obvious and a proof is outlined in the appendix . )",
    "our result is the following .",
    "[ thm1 ] the number of @xmath1 avoiders of length @xmath2 with @xmath3 left - to - right maxima , of which @xmath4 initiate a descent in the permutation and @xmath5 do not , is @xmath6 .",
    "section 2 explains the @xmath12 factor , and reduces the problem to the case @xmath13 .",
    "section 3 looks at the structure of the avoiders with @xmath13 and presents a bijection to complete the proof . to standardize a permutation means to replace its smallest entry by 1 , next smallest by 2 , and so on",
    "we begin with a reduction of the problem . deleting the",
    "that do not initiate a descent and standardizing the remaining permutation does not affect the avoider status because a can serve only as the 5 of a 542 pattern or as the 3 in the 31 of a 31542 pattern , and each deleted is immediately followed ( in the original permutation ) by another or ends the path and so `` it wo nt be missed '' .",
    "furthermore , the original permutation can be recovered from knowledge of the deleted entries and the standardized permutation .",
    "these observations account for the @xmath12 factor ( choose @xmath5 entries from @xmath0 $ ] to serve as the that do not initiate a descent ) , and it means that theorem [ thm1 ] will follow from    [ thm2 ] the number of @xmath1-avoiding permutations with @xmath4 , all of which initiate a descent , is @xmath14 .",
    "to characterize @xmath1-avoiders in which each initiates a descent , it is convenient to represent a permutation @xmath8 as the usual matrix diagram , as in figure 1 , with a bullet in the @xmath15 position ( measuring from lower left ) if and only if @xmath16 .    the determine the upper left staircase boundary and the yellow lines through the delineate a collection of @xmath17 cells ( the white rectangles ) , where @xmath4 is the number of",
    ". some cells may be empty ( contain no bullets ) or even vacuous ( contain no area ) . the cells in turn split into horizontal strips and also into vertical strips : the @xmath18-th horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) strip contains @xmath19 ( resp.@xmath18 ) cells .",
    "the condition that each initiates a descent means that no vertical strip consists entirely of empty cells .",
    "suppose each in a permutation @xmath8 initiates a descent",
    ". then @xmath8 is @xmath1-avoiding if and only if the bullets in each horizontal strip are rising from left to right .    proof .",
    "two falling bullets correspond to an inversion @xmath20 in the permutation . if they lie in the same horizontal strip , let @xmath21 denote the associated with this strip . then @xmath22 is a 542 with no available 3 let alone 31 .    on the other hand , neither the 4 nor 2 of a 542 pattern can be a and , if the rising bullet condition holds , the 4 and 2 lie in _ different _ horizontal strips . the @xmath23 associated with the horizontal strip containing the 2 serves as the 3 .",
    "the vertical strip associated with @xmath23 is nonempty ( since all vertical strips are nonempty ) and any bullet in it serves as the 1 .",
    "let @xmath24\\times [ 2]\\times \\ldots \\times [ \\k]$ ] ( which may conveniently be referred to as the set of inversion codes for permutations of @xmath25 $ ] ) , and let @xmath26 denote the set of partitions of @xmath0 $ ] into @xmath4 blocks in a canonical form : the smallest entry of each block is last , the remaining entries increase left to right , and the blocks are arranged in order of increasing smallest entry . for example , @xmath27 . clearly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the _ successors _ in @xmath8 are the entries immediately following the , that is , the terminators of the descents which the initiate .",
    "here is a bijection from the set @xmath30 of @xmath1-avoiding permutations of @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath4 , all of which initiate descents , to @xmath31 .",
    "given @xmath32 , draw its diagram .",
    "record the horizontal strips ( numbered bottom to top ) of the successors in @xmath8 . in the example of figure 1 , the successors are @xmath33 and their horizontal strips are @xmath34 .",
    "this is the desired inversion code .",
    "erase the bullets of the successors ( figure 2a ) , `` prettify '' the diagram ( figure 2b ) , record the position of each bullet , bottom to top , among all the bullets and place a divider to the right of each right - to - left minimum .",
    "this is the desired partition in @xmath35 and it is already in canonical form .",
    "the example yields @xmath36 .",
    "the map is reversible because the diagram of figure 2b can be recovered from the partition , the inversion code determines the cell of each missing bullet and , within the cell , the bullet s horizontal position is the extreme left ( since it lies immediately after a ) and its vertical position is determined by the rising bullet condition .",
