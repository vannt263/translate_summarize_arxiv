    "these effects are unimportant in our analysis , for several reasons .",
    "first , the duration of the starburst is short ( @xmath44yr ) compared to the total time during which a merger will be identified ( @xmath45yr ) , and the fraction of the total stellar mass formed therein is small .",
    "most of the time the merger will be a weakly - interacting pair or post - merger remnant , so corrections to luminosity or mass functions will in any case be small , @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , surveys identifying mergers by pair counts or tidal features with which we compare generally do not include the heavily obscured starburst stage .",
    "second , we explicitly confine ourselves to consider the near - ir through near - uv , where the effects of these obscuration mechanisms are minimized . for typical ulirgs ,",
    "central luminosities can be heavily extinguished with @xmath47 even in @xmath8-band ; but as a consequence the integrated luminosity is dominated by stars in more extended regions , which are obscured by the relatively quiescent ism with a much lower effective total or `` screen '' extinction of @xmath48 magnitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to that in our simulations .",
    "third , re - radiation is relatively unimportant in the bands we consider , and at the point of the nuclear starburst , even the typical ism densities are sufficient to render the most dense regions optically thick . at such a point ,",
    "the obscuration mechanism and the `` degree '' of optical thickness are unimportant .",
    "finally , we have compared with full radiative transfer models in the far - ir through uv , including dust heating and considering different sub - resolution models for the detailed clumping of molecular gas ( narayanan et al .",
    "2006 ; chakrabarti et al .",
    "2006 ) , and find little change in the total luminosity in the bands we consider here , even during peak starburst stages .",

    "there is no clear systematic difference in @xmath51 at fixed gas fraction ( we have also varied e.g.  initial black hole mass , presence or absence of initial bulges , and orbital parameters and find the same ) .",
    "however , there is a systematic dependence on the gas fraction , so that @xmath51 is somewhat lower for high-@xmath49 systems which are dominated by younger stellar populations .",
    "we can estimate this effect quantitatively as a function of @xmath49 with a model in which a galaxy of total final stellar mass @xmath52 forms a fraction @xmath49 of its mass in the merger ( i.e.assuming the limit of efficient conversion of gas to stars ) with mass - to - light ratio @xmath53 , and the remaining mass coming from an older population with @xmath54 .",
    "this gives @xmath55 fitting to the mean @xmath51 in our mergers as a function of @xmath49 gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 , corresponding to stellar populations with mean ages @xmath58 and @xmath59gyr , respectively , reasonable values for observed mergers .",
    "this equation gives the mean @xmath51 accurate to @xmath60 ; i.e.  comparable to the scatter in @xmath51 in a given merger and across mergers with varied parameters ( but similar gas fractions ) .",
    "note that the dependence is fairly weak , as a factor of 2 change in gas fraction ( e.g.  @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) results in only a @xmath63 change in @xmath51 , generally smaller than the relevant observational uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath8-band total mass - to - light ratio is also relatively constant with time in a merger . in part",
    ", this owes to the weak dependence of @xmath51 on stellar population age and the continuous star formation throughout the merger . for example , given a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) beginning at @xmath64 , and ignoring older stars ( i.e.  roughly the @xmath65 case ) , we expect @xmath51 to increase by only @xmath66 from @xmath67gyr to @xmath68gyr , as in figure  [ fig : k.ml ]",
    ". moreover , as seen in simulations @xcite and observations of local ulirgs such as arp 200 @xcite , increased densities in the merger give rise to both elevated star formation but also enhanced obscuration , resulting in a flat observed host galaxy luminosity during these times .",
    "unfortunately , without a large sample of mergers or a reliable means to determine the exact merger stage or pre - merger @xmath49 , comparing our predicted @xmath51 as a function of time with observations is not possible , but we can check for consistency . in figure",

    "the characteristic luminosity at which the merger is observed can be affected by @xmath49 , at least for optical / uv samples .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the distribution of gas fractions will be drawn from some pdf , which may depend on galaxy mass .",
    "we do not model this ( instead adopting a `` mean '' @xmath49 at a given redshift ) , primarily because it introduces additional , poorly constrained parameters and because it is unclear to what extent this correlation is driven by more massive systems having undergone previous major mergers ( i.e.  their pre - merger gas fractions may have been uniform ) .",
    "however , the effect is less important than might be expected , for two reasons .",
    "first , the scaling with mass is not steep ( i.e.  a factor @xmath199 in @xmath117 yields a factor @xmath42 in @xmath49 , similar to the existing uncertainty ) .",
    "second , our modeling and the observations of @xcite imply that the merger mass and luminosity functions do not have steep low mass / faint - end slopes , meaning that it is a good approximation to adopt the typical mean @xmath200 of galaxies near the mglf `` break '' .",
    "in detail , we have considered our calculations adopting the @xmath49 as a function of late - type galaxy mass from @xcite , and find it makes little difference to our predictions ( generally modifying them within existing @xmath201 uncertainties ) .",
    "of course , to the extent that @xmath49 evolves with redshift ( see below ) , this consideration is important in disentangling how much of that evolution owes to a change in the characteristic masses of merging galaxies or to gas depletion through quiescent star formation .",
    "even if the vertical and horizontal normalizations of the mglf ( equivalently , @xmath167 and @xmath49 ) were completely undetermined , we show in   [ sec : comparisons.qlf.mglf ] that the mglf and qlf _ shapes _ are not trivially related , and this alone provides a strong test of models of quasar lightcurves and triggering .",
    "moreover , these systematics ( contained in @xmath49 and @xmath167 ) are reasonably well - constrained as described above , and the systematic dependencies in our comparisons are not especially strong over the range in which they are constrained .",

    "the key point from the above , however , is that our theoretical factor @xmath164 uncertainty in @xmath167 ( which stems from not modeling the full sample selection function and e.g.  cosmological orbit distributions ) is not important for our conclusions , as any value of @xmath167 in this range still produces a good fit to observed qlfs ( i.e.  gives a self - consistent mapping between qlf and mglf ) .",
    "likewise , variations in merging galaxy gas fraction do not change our results .    moreover ,",
    "cosmic variance is likely to overwhelm the systematic normalization issues above for the small volumes probed in observational measurements of merging galaxy statistics .",

    "further , the sample is restricted to major mergers , with @xmath8-band magnitude differences less than 1mag ( i.e.within a factor @xmath219 in mass ) , corresponding well to our modeling because these mergers are most likely to trigger starburst and quasar activity and to be visible as peculiar / interacting galaxies for comparison with morphologically selected mglfs @xcite .",

    "we show the results for a characteristic @xmath227gyr , corresponding roughly to the time when the galaxies are within @xmath228kpc of one another in our simulations before merging ( appropriate for the maximal projected separation @xmath229kpc of the observed sample ) , and @xmath230 , corresponding to the typical gas fractions of galaxies around the mass of the observed mglf peak @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in   [ sec : comparisons.systematics ] , our results are relatively insensitive to these choices .",

    "the prediction shown in this case is the best - fit allowing @xmath167 , @xmath49 , and the quasar lifetime @xmath181 to vary freely , giving @xmath233yr for @xmath234gyr ( only the ratio @xmath235 is constrained ) and @xmath236 .",
    "the dotted lines show the prediction for @xmath181 larger or smaller by an order of magnitude .    in our model , the faint end of the observed qlf",

    "a one - to - one correspondence between peak and observed quasar luminosity ( dashed lines ) , the faint - end qlf depends directly on the faint - end mglf , and is thus poorly constrained .",
    "the agreement between the observed qlf and our prediction is good , @xmath237 and it requires no fine - tuning of any parameters .",
    "however , even allowing both horizontal and vertical normalizations to vary freely , the _ shapes _ alone of the quasar and mglfs rule out a `` light bulb '' or exponential lightcurve model at greater than @xmath238 confidence , with the best - fit @xmath239 ( @xmath240 adopting a constant merger fraction ) .",
    "such a fit furthermore requires a quasar lifetime @xmath241yr , at the low extreme of the range indicated by observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in any model",
    "which reproduces the observed @xmath242 relation , @xmath175 must have approximately the same shape as the merger rate as a function of @xmath117 , itself given approximately by the merger mass function .",
    "this shape is observationally well - defined , with a rapid decline above and flattening or decrease below the break luminosity . in @xcite , we argue that this is the shape of @xmath175 ( equivalently @xmath243 ) implied by the combination of our model for quasar lifetimes with the observed qlf .",
    "however , in idealized models of the quasar lightcurve , @xmath175 must have the same shape as the observed qlf , which can not be self - consistently resolved with the observed mglfs .",
    "it is true that the faint - end slope of the mglf is poorly constrained , with @xmath244 ; however , to be compatible with the faint end slope of the qlf in a light - bulb model ( i.e.  to steepen the dashed line to match the solid line in figure  [ fig : lfs ] ) requires a @xmath245 change in @xmath246 ( @xmath247 relative to a constant merger fraction ) , which seems unlikely , given the large quoted error which includes systematic effects .",
    "next , we invert this comparison and employ the observed qlf to estimate the mglf .",

    "these can be compared to the black squares , which show the binned mglf from @xcite ( open circles show the constant merger fraction estimate ) . as expected from the upper left panel ,",
    "the agreement using our full model of quasar lifetimes is good ( @xmath249 ) , and the agreement with an idealized model of the quasar lifetime is poor ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "the constraints from the observed qlf on the mglf are significantly weaker than the constraints on the qlf from the observed mglf .",
    "this is not because the qlf is poorly constrained relative to the mglf ( in fact , the opposite is true ) .",
    "rather , it is because a given interval in observed quasar luminosity has significant contributions from quasars with a wide range of peak luminosities @xmath251 ( and a correspondingly wide range in host galaxy stellar mass ) , in various stages of evolution .",
    "thus , there are significant degeneracies in predicting the relative contributions from different black hole or host galaxy stellar masses to the observed qlf based only on its observed shape .",
    "this is increasingly true at fainter merger luminosities , and therefore we can place only weak constraints on the faint - end @xmath175 distribution ( as discussed in e.g.  lidz et al .",
    "the weak constraints at the high-@xmath252 end , however , owe to larger statistical errors in the qlf .",
    "the wide range in the allowed faint-@xmath252 end of the mglf ( demonstrated by the similar predictions given the observed mglf or a constant merger fraction ) is reassuring , in the sense that at low luminosities , selection effects become important in efforts to identify a sample of merging galaxies , but these will not significantly change our result .",
    "as an intermediate stage in these calculations , we have derived the implied @xmath172 ; i.e.  the merger rate or birthrate of spheroids with stellar mass , directly related to the black hole `` triggering '' rate .",
    "we show these @xmath172 distributions in figure  [ fig : lfs ] ( upper right panel ) , where the blue horizontal shaded range shows the @xmath226 range implied by the observed mglf of @xcite ( vertically shaded range implied by a constant merger fraction ) , and the red range shows the @xmath226 range implied by the observed qlf of @xcite at @xmath224 .",
    "again , it is clear that the qlf provides poor constraints on the low - mass behavior of @xmath172 . for comparison ,",
    "we plot the fitted @xmath172 distributions of @xcite , which were fitted to the combination of optical , soft x - ray , and hard x - ray qlfs @xcite .",
    "these may rise to lower masses before turning over than is implied by the mglf , but as we have emphasized above ( and shown in e.g.  hopkins et al .",
    "2006b ) this produces an essentially identical prediction for the properties of the quasar and remnant red galaxy populations .",
    "we repeat the analysis in   [",
    "sec : comparisons.qlf.mglf.k ] , for the observed 280 nm uv mglf of @xcite from the gems and goods surveys at @xmath138 .",
    "in detail , the galaxies are selected from the overlapping area of combo-17 and gems , with photometric redshifts @xmath253 and observed @xmath254 ( corresponding approximately to a rest - frame @xmath255-band ) .",
    "the sample consists of visually identified morphologically selected peculiar / interacting galaxies , and as a consequence there is considerable observational uncertainty in the faint end of the mglf , where tidal features are especially difficult to detect given surface brightness dimming at higher redshifts .",
    "however , as we demonstrate above in the case of the @xmath8-band mglf , our modeling of the qlf is not sensitive to this faint - end behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfs ] shows this comparison in the lower panels , in the same manner as the upper panels . the lower left panel shows the predicted qlf using our full model for the quasar lightcurve ( solid line ) , and instead for an idealized `` light - bulb '' model for the quasar lightcurve ( dashed line ) , with uncertainties as in",

    "whether we use the gems or goods data makes little difference in the prediction of our model , so we show the result using the goods luminosity function , which has a larger number of faint merging galaxies , maximizing the ability of the `` light bulb '' model to match the data .",
    "again , it is clear that our model provides a good fit , while the `` light bulb '' model is ruled out at greater than @xmath257 confidence ( @xmath258 respectively ) .",

    "a @xmath262 change in the faint - end slope of the mglf would be required for the `` light bulb '' model to agree with the qlf , even for the maximal estimate of the number of faint mergers in @xcite .",

    "the inferred mglfs can be compared to those of @xcite from the goods survey , gems survey , and a combination of gems depth on the goods area .",
    "the differences in the observed mglfs at the faint end demonstrate the considerable observational uncertainty here , but the qlf is not sensitive to this faint - end behavior .",
    "this is not the case for the idealized `` light bulb '' model , as demonstrated by the narrow range of the green hatched region even at low luminosities .",
    "the constraints are weaker , but the agreement between our model predictions and the observed mglf is good ( @xmath263 , compared to @xmath264 for the light - bulb model ) .",
    "finally , we show the @xmath172 distribution implied by the mglf of @xcite ( lower right panel ) as the blue shaded range , the range implied by the qlf at @xmath256 is indicated as the red shaded range , with the fits to @xmath172 used in @xcite .",
    "the implied @xmath172 distributions at @xmath256 and @xmath224 from 280 nm and @xmath8-band observations , respectively , can be compared to infer the evolution of merger rates and quasar birthrates as a function of mass , but we caution against taking this comparison too far .",
    "the samples use various selection criteria , are from different surveys , are not in the same wavebands , and have different dependence on gas fraction .",
    "therefore , the potential systematic effects may be quite different between the two .",
    "we repeat our analysis using the morphologically separated mass functions of @xcite from goods and deep2 .",

    "while the agreement between quasar and merger statistics is encouraging , we now test our modeling of the mglf directly by comparing the observed 280 nm mglf of @xcite to the measured merger mass functions of @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xcite mass functions determined from the goods field , with redshifts @xmath272 , similar to the @xmath253 range considered in @xcite . in both cases , optical or near - ir morphologies",
    "are used to visually select merging systems , so the ambiguity in selection effects is minimized .",

    "the observed merger mass function of @xcite is shown as the black squares , with the black dotted line showing the best - fit schechter function .",
    "the merger mass function implied by the mglf and our modeling agrees well with that observed , suggesting that we are capturing the critical dependence of observed merger luminosities on host properties .",
    "coupled with observations of a similar relation between black hole and spheroid mass at these redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we compare this to the observed sfrf of the same merging galaxy sample , determined in @xcite .",
    "note that while @xcite determine the sfrf and relative number density as a function of morphology , they do not determine the absolute sfrf normalization ( i.e.  proper effective volume correction ) , and so we adopt that inferred by @xcite at @xmath278 from spitzer in the chandra deep field south .",
    "red points are observations with no correction for incompleteness below @xmath279 , while black points have been corrected for incompleteness at low sfr based on the comparison of gems and goods luminosity functions from @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good , implying that we are properly modeling the relation between the optical / uv luminosity of mergers and at least the statistics of the induced star formation as a function of time .",
    "this is not trivial , as there is no one - to - one correspondence between the 280 nm luminosity and sfr ( as optical / uv lightcurves are flat while sfrs change by orders of magnitude ) .",
    "also note that , because both the 280 nm magnitude and sfr distributions are functions of @xmath87 ( as opposed to @xmath52 ) , the relation between the two is independent of @xmath52 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is also of interest to compare our prediction for the distribution of mergers and sfrfs to that from semi - analytic models . in general",
    ", this is difficult , as the events of interest are not mergers of dark matter halos , but involve the luminous galaxies themselves , in which the galaxies are of comparable mass and have a large supply of cold ( rotationally supported ) gas .",
    "furthermore , the exact requirements for triggering starbursts and agn depend on , for example , the pressurization of ism gas , star formation recipes , and the distribution of orbital parameters in the mergers ( e.g. , hernquist & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "we have specifically chosen to quantify the properties of mergers in terms of e.g.  @xmath194 , @xmath52 , and @xmath87 , in a manner which suppresses these dependencies , in order to relate merger , starburst , and quasar populations independent of these detailed ( and difficult to model ) cosmological distributions .",
    "it is therefore outside the scope of this paper to consider a detailed comparison of merger rates as a function of these conditions as implied by e.g.  our semi - empirical modeling , semi - analytic models , and cosmological simulations .",
    "however , we briefly consider a comparison between our predicted merger - driven sfrf and that predicted by semi - analytic models in figure  [ fig : sfrf.z07 ] .",
    "we show as the red solid line the sfrf predicted owing to major mergers ( mass ratios less than @xmath2803:1 ) , and as the blue solid line the sfrf owing to `` minor '' mergers ( mass ratios less than @xmath28010:1 ) , calculated at @xmath256 from the semi - analytic models of @xcite .",
    "we consider a galaxy to be `` merging '' if it has undergone a merger within a time @xmath281gyr ( blue dotted line shows the minor - merger prediction for a merger time @xmath282yr ) .",
    "there is broad agreement , suggesting that the rate of gas - rich mergers in the standard cdm cosmology is appropriate to that implied by our modeling and the observations .",
    "however , it is only with the inclusion of some `` minor '' mergers that the semi - analytic model predictions match the observations and our predictions from the qlf and mglf , suggesting that our implied merger rates as a function of final , total stellar mass may have contributions from a wide range of mass ratios @xmath28010:1 to 1:1 ( which we implicitly account for by expressing the merger rate in terms of the final mass and peak quasar luminosity ) , increasingly dominated by major mergers at the high - mass end .",
    "this comparison , though , is sensitive to the estimate of the observable timescales in the semi - analytic model ( but see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for comparison with these merger rate estimates ) .",
    "now , we use the observed qlf to predict the mglf at redshifts where measurements do not yet exist . we have seen that the observed qlf is insensitive to the number of low - mass mergers .",

    "this also does not imply that all agn activity is associated with gas - rich mergers , as there can be a substantial contribution to low - luminosity agn from activity triggered in quiescent spirals ( for a detailed comparison , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the large amount of quiescent , low - level activity in relaxed ellipticals which we predict ( and account for ) many dynamical times after the spheroid - forming merger as the quasar lightcurve decays @xcite .",
    "our modeling makes predictions that can be used to test our underlying theory .",
    "for example , mergers at high redshifts should involve galaxies that are , on average , more gas - rich than local spirals ( our preliminary comparison , for example , favors an exponentially declining @xmath49 over @xmath280a few gyr ) .",
    "preliminary evidence from @xcite indicates that galaxies at redshift @xmath382 do , indeed , have large gas fractions @xmath383 , with some approaching @xmath384 , but future observatories such as alma should be able to measure this accurately .",
    "the connection between merger - driven star formation and quasar activity can also be used to test the correlation between our predicted sfr distributions and quasar peak luminosity .",
    "this should be possible with improved observations of quasar hosts in relaxed , post - merger systems which can be used to determine their individual star formation histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as measurements of star formation in obscured , lower - luminosity merger phases , possibly associated with ir - bright type 2 quasar activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and strongly reddened optical quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "mergers of gas - rich spirals will imprint structure into the remnants that may be difficult to account for otherwise ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the starburst population left behind will characteristically modify the central light profiles and kinematics of merger remnants ( e.g.  mihos & hernquist 1994b ; hernquist & barnes 1991 ) , possibly explaining the central excesses of light seen in merging systems ( e.g.  rothberg & joseph 2004 , 2006 ) , and the presence of kinematic subsystems in ellipticals .",
    "this can be tested in detail by comparing predictions for metallicity and color gradients and orbital distributions with observations .",
    "more subtle may be the shells , ripples , loops and other fine structures seen around many relaxed ellipticals ( see , e.g.  schweizer 1998 ) that require a source of dynamically cold stellar material and are hence a natural consequence of major mergers involving disk galaxies ( e.g.  hernquist & spergel 1992 ) , but do _ not _ form in major mergers between hot stellar systems ( e.g. hernquist & quinn 1988 ) .",
    "a measurement of the rate of occurrence of fine structure in red galaxies with redshift would further constrain the importance of mergers involving disk galaxies to the formation of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "we use our simulations to develop a formalism to derive the relations between the various populations we have studied in a manner robust against different cosmological distributions which are poorly constrained and often tuned to reproduce observations .",
    "however , this also means that we can not constrain certain cosmological distributions .",
    "for example , we find that the distribution of observed luminosities of a merger is robust when expressed as a function of the final stellar mass or total stellar mass formed in the merger .",
    "this enables us to map the mglf to a merger mass function , but does not allow us to consider the relative contribution of mergers with e.g.different initial mass ratios , ism equations of state , or star formation histories",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether cosmological simulations yield the distributions of merger statistics that we have derived from quasar , merger , and elliptical galaxy observations .",
    "coupling such cosmological descriptions with our detailed modeling of the complex star formation and black hole growth histories in mergers enables an a priori theoretical prediction of the wide array of phenomena we have demonstrated are linked through gas - rich galaxy mergers .",

    "<S> using a model for the self - regulated growth of supermassive black holes in mergers involving gas - rich galaxies , we study the relationship between quasars and the population of merging galaxies and thereby predict the merger - driven star formation rate density of the universe . in our picture , </S>",
    "<S> mergers drive gas inflows , fueling nuclear starbursts and `` buried '' quasars until feedback disperses the gas , allowing the quasar to be briefly visible as a bright optical source . as black hole accretion declines , the quasar dies and the stellar remnant relaxes passively with properties and correlations typical of red , elliptical galaxies . by simulating the evolution of such events , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the observed _ statistics _ of merger rates / fractions , luminosity functions , mass functions , star formation rate distributions , quasar luminosity functions , quasar host galaxy luminosity functions , and elliptical / red galaxy luminosity and mass functions are self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> we use our simulations to de - convolve both the quasar and merging galaxy luminosity functions to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass and merger rates as a function of the total stellar mass and the mass of new stars formed during a merger . from this , we predict the merging galaxy luminosity function in various observed wavebands ( e.g.  uv , optical , and near - ir ) , color - magnitude relations , mass functions , absolute and specific star formation rate distributions and star formation rate density , and quasar host galaxy luminosity function , as a function of redshift from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we invert this relationship to predict e.g.  quasar luminosity functions from observed merger luminosity functions or star formation rate distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show good agreement with observations , but idealized models of quasar lightcurves give inaccurate estimates and are ruled out by comparison of merging galaxy and quasar observations at @xmath1 confidence , provided that quasars are triggered in mergers . using only observations of quasars </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the contribution of mergers to the star formation rate density of the universe to high redshifts , @xmath2 , and constrain the evolution in the characteristic initial gas fractions of quasar and spheroid - producing mergers . </S>"
