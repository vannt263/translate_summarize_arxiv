    "eutrophication is the large increase of aquatic plants due to the discharge in waterbodies of chemical elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus .",
    "dead aquatic plants generate detritus , exploiting large amount of dissolved oxygen for its decomposition , and therefore endangering aquatic life and fish survival .",
    "we introduce here a mathematical model for such an ecosystem and investigate its behavior .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively denote the nutrients , detritus and dissolved oxygen amount in the water .",
    "further , let @xmath3 denote the aquatic plants population .",
    "the nutrients @xmath0 are assumed to be discharged into the lake at rate @xmath4 ; they also are generated by the reconversion of decomposed detritus , at rate @xmath5 , a fraction @xmath6 of which becomes new nutrient .",
    "this process involves also the usage of dissolved oxygen , and therefore the term representing it must contain the product of both the required quantities , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , nutrients can be washed away from the body water by emissaries , at rate @xmath7 and there are further losses due to nutrients uptake by the plants , that need them for surviving .",
    "the uptake rate is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the plants reproduce because they assume nutrients , this grazing being expressed by the product @xmath9 , but only a fraction @xmath10 of the assumed nutrients contribute to increase the plant biomass .",
    "the plants have a natural mortality rate @xmath11 , and experience intraspecific competition at rate @xmath12 .",
    "the detritus originates by dead plants . a proportion @xmath13 of the plants that die",
    "sink to the bottom of the water body and become detritus . in part",
    "the latter may be washed away by outgoing streams , at rate @xmath14 ; in addition , using dissolved oxygen , detritus at rate @xmath5 may be decomposed by microorganisms into its basic elements , which contribute to the formation of nutrients .",
    "finally , dissolved oxygen may be contained into the streams flowing into the lake , we assume this to occur at rate @xmath15 , but it is also produced by the aquatic plants through photosynthesis , at rate @xmath16 . because most of aquatic plants float on the surface of a lake , large amount of the produced oxygen may go into the air , justifying the fact that the rate @xmath16 may be small .",
    "in addition , there could be a shading effect , for which only the plants near the surface get enough light , while the ones in the lower layers of water are in part shaded from direct sunlight by the topmost ones . in order for photosynthesis to be viable , plants need clorophyll and consume nutrients for its production .",
    "thus , in the model we must model this process via the bilinear term @xmath17 .",
    "further , there is a natural upper limit on their oxygen production capacity , that produces a saturation limit , a fact that is expressed by using a holling type ii function to model it , @xmath18 being the half saturation constant .",
    "in addition , dissolved oxygen is also washed away at rate @xmath19 .",
    "other losses are due to the decomposition of detritus into its basic components , a process that we said requires microorganisms that consume oxygen , at rate @xmath20 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the model takes the following form : @xmath21",
    "we now evaluate the region of attraction for all solutions initiating in the positive octant .",
    "let @xmath22 . adding all the equilibrium equations , we obtain @xmath23 dropping some of the negative terms , taking into account that @xmath24 and that the last fraction is smaller than one and defining @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the above differential equations becomes the following differential inequality @xmath27 the solution of the associated differential equation is @xmath28 .",
    "thus we obtain the final estimate that defines the region of attraction for all solutions initiating in the interior of the positive orthant : @xmath29",
    "the model ( [ model1 ] ) has only two equilibria : the environment containing only oxygen and nutrients , @xmath30 , and the system in which all the components are at nonzero level @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to the general case , there are several particular cases , that arise when one or both of the exogenous inputs are blocked : @xmath32 arising with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 whenever @xmath34 , @xmath36 obtained for @xmath33 .",
    "feasibility of each @xmath37 , @xmath38 is obvious . to analyze coexistence , from the second equilibrium equation of ( [ model1 ] ) @xmath39 are obtained . now substituting into the first equilibrium equation",

    "when @xmath50 instead , @xmath47 for every @xmath51 .",
    "to impose @xmath52 , we study the concave parabola @xmath53 , with roots @xmath54 . for @xmath46",
    ", we have that @xmath55 for @xmath56 , going down from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . from ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ d * ] ) : @xmath59 to guarantee its nonnegativity , we combine the above results for @xmath45 and @xmath53 , to get the following condition and the corresponding nonnegativity interval : @xmath60    let @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the discriminant of @xmath67 be @xmath68 . eliminating @xmath9 from ( [ n * ] ) , the fourth equilibrium equation instead gives : @xmath69 ( v+zd^*)^{-1 } = befw \\chi ( p ) [ \\pi ( p ) \\gamma ( p)]^{-1},\\ ] ]    to find sufficient conditions for the intersection of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath51 , we study each function separately .",
    "@xmath70 is positive if conditions ( [ od ] ) hold . in the case",
    "( a ) @xmath70 increases from a zero at @xmath72 toward the vertical asymptote at @xmath73 .",
    "the sign of @xmath71 is instead determined just by the one of @xmath67 . in principle , there is the following possible case guaranteeing that the concave parabola @xmath67 is positive .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath74 , @xmath75 which implies a decreasing branch of this parabola lies in the first quadrant between the vertical axis and its positive root @xmath76 , joining @xmath77 with @xmath78 .    correspondingly , there is a possible case for @xmath71 being nonnegative when @xmath51 : it raises up from a positive height at the origin to the vertical asymptote at @xmath79 .",
    "we now combine @xmath70 and @xmath71 to find an intersection in the first quadrant .",
    "( 1 ) is compatible with ( a ) .",
    "sufficient conditions for @xmath80 to lie in the first quadrant is @xmath81",
    "let @xmath82 be the jacobian of ( [ model1 ] ) and let @xmath83 denote the matrix @xmath84 evaluated at each equilibrium @xmath37 : @xmath85 for @xmath86 the eigenvalues are all negative , namely @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "from the condition ( [ p*_suff ] ) , @xmath94 we can obtain that if the equilibrium @xmath95 exists , @xmath96 becomes a saddle point . @xmath97 has four negative eigenvalues @xmath87 ,",

    "the eigenvalues at the equilibrium @xmath100 are @xmath87 , @xmath93 , @xmath101 , @xmath90 and again this equilibrium is a saddle point when @xmath95 exists .",

    "[ q ] we observe that with increasing @xmath4 , the densities of nutrients , aquatic plants and detritus increase .",
    "in fact , for @xmath33 their densities become zero within a short period .",
    "the opposite results occur instead for dissolved oxygen , the concentration of which increases with decreasing @xmath4 . when @xmath33 , dissolved oxygen attains its maximum concentration .",
    "figure [ f ] depicts instead the effect of rate of conversion of detritus into nutrients on the coexistence equilibrium @xmath95 .",
    "a similar situation as for figure [ q ] arises . with increasing @xmath121 , the densities of nutrients , aquatic plants and detritus increase , while the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases",
    "the ecosystem could disappear , as the equilibrium @xmath91 is locally asymptotically stable , not surprisingly .",
    "in fact a pond lacking sufficient inputs becomes dry , and all its components disappear .",
    "the no - life equilibrium @xmath99 is also always stably achievable . @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath100 can be rendered stable if @xmath50 .",
    "rewritten as @xmath122 it means that the reduced plants natality , i.e. the ratio of new plants over their mortality , should be bounded above by the reduced nutrients depletion rate , i.e. the ratio of their washout rate to the net input rate .",
    "hence , more nutrients are supplied into the system than they are used for plant reproduction . in such case",
