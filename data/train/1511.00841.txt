    "the top - quark mass is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its value significantly affects predictions for many observables either directly or via radiative corrections . as a consequence ,",
    "the measured top - quark mass is one of the crucial inputs to electroweak precision fits , which enable comparisons between experimental results and predictions within and beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , together with the higgs - boson mass , it has critical implications on the stability of the electroweak vacuum  @xcite .    in fixed - order and analytically resummed predictions",
    ", the top - quark mass appears as a parameter of the lagrangian and , therefore , depends on the choice of the renormalization scheme once corrections beyond leading order ( lo ) are consistently included .",
    "the conventional scheme choice in many applications of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the pole mass @xmath2 , while alternative definitions based on the ( modified ) minimal subtraction realize the concept of a running mass @xmath3 at a renormalization scale @xmath4 as a particular example of so - called short - distance masses . on the other hand ,",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations generally contain not only hard - interaction calculations at lo or next - to leading order ( nlo ) , with the fixed - order matrix elements as functions of the top - quark s pole mass @xmath2 , but also contributions from initial and final state radiation , hadronization , as well as underlying - event interactions , modeled by parton shower programs based on leading - logarithm approximations and heuristic models .",
    "all these effects can lead to systematic shifts in the value of the top - quark mass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , mc simulations presently do not allow for a precise definition of the quark mass renormalization scheme .",
    "the top - quark mass has been determined with remarkable precision : the current world average quoted as 173.34 @xmath5 0.76@xmath6is obtained by combining results from the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , these measurements rely on the relation between the top - quark mass and the respective experimental observable , e.g. , the reconstructed invariant mass of the top - quark decay products .",
    "this relation is derived by using mc simulations , so that these measurements determine the top - quark mass parameter implemented in these simulations .",
    "therefore , the determined parameter is the so - called monte - carlo mass @xmath0 , which appears most appropriate to describe experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the unambiguous interpretation of the experimental results for @xmath0 in terms of a lagrangian top - quark mass ( @xmath7 ) in a specific renormalization scheme employed in the sm has been a longstanding and increasingly urgent problem , given the importance of the value of the top - quark mass for sm physics analysis and the small uncertainty in the experimental measurement of @xmath0  @xcite . at present",
    ", the translation from @xmath0to a theoretically well - defined mass definition in a short - distance scheme at a low scale can only be estimated to be @xmath8  gev , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in consequence",
    ", a measurement of @xmath1is preferable and can be performed by confronting a measured observable sensitive to @xmath1with its prediction , calculated at nlo in qcd or beyond in a well - defined renormalization scheme for the top - quark mass . for this purpose , the inclusive cross section ( @xmath9 ) and",
    "the normalized differential cross sections for top - quark pair ( @xmath10 ) production have been employed to determine the pole mass  @xcite . for these measurements of @xmath2 ,",
    "detector and process modeling effects are evaluated using mc simulations , so that the measured observable typically depends on @xmath0 . even though the extracted value of @xmath2does not depend on a specific @xmath0hypothesis , it relies on the relation between both parameters , the exact difference ( @xmath11 ) being unknown .",
    "however , it is often assumed to be up to 1@xmath6 , leading to a systematic uncertainty on the measurement  @xcite , which might be under- or overestimated .",
    "this uncertainty can be small when only the shape of a particular observable defined within the detectors fiducial volume is considered  @xcite , since the dependence on @xmath0mainly enters through detector - acceptance effects . however , the sensitivity to @xmath1increases when the total @xmath10production rate is also taken into account .",
    "the pole mass scheme , which is inspired by the definition of the electron mass in quantum electrodynamics , has short - comings when applied to quarks in a confined theory  @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative corrections to @xmath2due to the infrared renormalon lead to an intrinsic theoretical ambiguity of the order of @xmath12  @xcite . alternatively , @xmath13can be calculated using other mass schemes  @xcite , such as the aforementioned running mass definition at a scale @xmath4 , @xmath3 , the so - called @xmath14mass . by using @xmath15 in the calculation of @xmath13 , the perturbative expansion in the strong coupling exhibits a significantly faster convergence  @xcite .",
    "this letter describes a generic approach to measure an observable @xmath16 sensitive to @xmath1 in a particular renormalization scheme without any prior assumptions on @xmath0or its relation to @xmath1 .",
    "the method employs a simultaneous likelihood fit of @xmath0and @xmath17 , comparing an observed distribution in data to its mc prediction . for the latter ,",
    "two categories of processes are taken into account .",
    "the first one corresponds to the signal process , i.e. top - quark pair production or single top - quark production , for which the cross section and event kinematics depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the second category comprises background processes such as e.g. the production of electroweak bosons and shows no significant dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , a determination of @xmath1can be performed in a given renormalization scheme comparing data to theory predictions for @xmath18 and , therefore , a calibration of @xmath0by quantifying the difference @xmath19 is possible .",
    "the method is first discussed for the special case with @xmath17being an inclusive signal production cross section and extended to differential cross sections in a second step .",
    "assume , to measure the inclusive cross section @xmath13 , a number of _ detected _ events , @xmath20 , is reconstructed and selected experimentally , with an _ efficiency _",
    "@xmath21 estimated by using simulation . in total , @xmath22 expected events are confronted with those observed in data .",

    "the parameterization is chosen such that the shape of the distribution constrains @xmath0 , while its normalization determines @xmath13 .",
    "for this purpose , the fraction of predicted signal events @xmath23 in bin @xmath24 is considered and the total number of predicted events @xmath25 in the same bin is written as : @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the contribution from background processes and @xmath28 the integrated luminosity .",
    "systematic uncertainties due to detector effects as well as signal and background process modeling are symbolized as parameters @xmath29and affect the expected event yields .",
    "for each bin @xmath24 , a poisson likelihood @xmath30 is derived from @xmath25 and the number of observed events @xmath31 .",
    "the values for @xmath13and @xmath0are determined from the maximum @xmath32 of the global likelihood @xmath33 here , @xmath34 represents optional terms that can model prior knowledge on the systematic uncertainties specific to the experiment .",
    "alternatively , the fit can be repeated for each individual systematic variation , leaving only @xmath0and @xmath13as free parameters .",
    "explicit correlations between @xmath13and @xmath0are introduced by the term @xmath35 . hence , the contribution of @xmath0to the total uncertainty on @xmath13can be minimized by reducing the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath0 or by the strong constraints on @xmath0through @xmath23 .    the dependence of the resulting measured cross section on @xmath0has been diminished and absorbed into the uncertainty , while the predicted cross section @xmath36 remains a function of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath1is given by the value at which the predicted and measured cross sections coincide . for calculating the uncertainties on @xmath37 ,",
    "correlations between @xmath13and @xmath0need to be accounted for but are known precisely as a result of the simultaneous fit .",
    "precise measurements of the inclusive @xmath10cross section are performed in the dileptonic decay channel by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of these measurements are below 4% and the dependence on @xmath0is small . in both analyses , @xmath2is extracted assuming @xmath38 , and assigning a corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the resulting total precision of @xmath2is about 2@xmath6  @xcite .",

    "the resulting precision is about 1.3@xmath6and the dominant uncertainties of both measurements are mostly orthogonal .",
