    "this low number of h@xmath0co maser regions was unexpected ( e.g. , forster et al .",
    "1985 ; gardner et al . 1986 ) given the detection of many h@xmath0co maser spots in a single source ( sgr b2 , whiteoak & gardner 1983 ; mehringer et al . 1994 ) , the widespread distribution of formaldehyde molecules as exemplified by galactic h@xmath0co 6@xmath1 cm absorption ( e.g. , watson et al . 2003 ; araya et al . 2002 ; downes et al . 1980 ; dieter 1973 ) , and the apparently common astrophysical conditions needed for the maser excitation if the masers were pumped by radio continuum radiation ( see pratap et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the idea that h@xmath0co masers may be pumped by background radio continuum was initially proposed by boland & de jong ( 1981 ) to explain the maser in ngc@xmath17538 irs1 .",
    "however , the low detection rate of new h@xmath0co masers in dedicated surveys ( mehringer et al . 1995 ; forster et al . 1985 ) , the non - detection of maser emission from the h@xmath0co 2@xmath1 cm transition ( e.g. , hoffman et al . 2003 ) and low emission measure ( or non - detection ) of radio continuum sources near several of the known h@xmath0co masers , indicate that the pumping mechanism in most cases can not be due to radio continuum excitation ( e.g. , see araya et al .",
    "2007c for the case of iras@xmath118566 + 0408 ) . the low detection rate of h@xmath0co masers led several authors to speculate that formaldehyde masers are rare because specific and/or short - lived physical conditions may be needed for the excitation ( e.g. , forster et al .",
