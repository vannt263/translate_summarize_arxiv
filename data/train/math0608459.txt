    "the vector spaces used here are finite dimensional and rings are commutative and have @xmath0 .    it was observed by milnor in his beautiful paper `` infinite cyclic coverings '' @xcite that the alexander polynomial of a knot and the reidemeistor torsion of the infinite cyclic covering space of the knot complement is directly related to each other , because of the fact that the infinite cyclic covering of a knot complement is acyclic when tensoring with the field of rational functions .",
    "turaev generalized this theorem of milnor to the case of links directly ( see `` reidemeister torsion in knot theory '' @xcite ) .",
    "but in the case of links , since the maximal abelian covering space of a link complement can not be made acyclic in general , the statement of turaev s generalization is not as nice as that of the theorem of milnor .",
    "one observation is that if we fix a link in @xmath1 , say the trivial link @xmath2 , then there are infinitely many links @xmath3 in @xmath1 , which admit natural maps @xmath4 .",
    "these natural maps , when lifted to the corresponding maximal abelian covering spaces , will induce isomorphisms on homology after tensoring with the quotient field of the polynomial ring over @xmath5 .",
    "can we extend the notion of torsion to such a setting ?",
    "if so , what will be the relationship between such torsion defined in this setting and the alexander polynomial of @xmath3 ?",
    "the goal of this paper is then to offer an approach for possibly answering these questions .",
    "we introduce the notion of reidemeister torsion for quasi - isomorphisms of based chain complexes over a field .",
    "we call a chain map a quasi - isomorphism if its induced homomorphism between homology is an isomorphism .",
    "our notion of torsion generalizes the torsion of acyclic based chain complexes , and is a chain homotopy invariant on the collection of all quasi - isomorphisms from a based chain complex to another .",
    "it shares nice properties with torsion of acyclic based chain complexes , like multiplicativity and duality .",
    "we will further generalize our torsion to quasi - isomorphisms between free chain complexes over a ring under some mild condition .",
    "since the acyclic condition is crucial whenever the notion of torsion is studied , we hope that our point of view of torsion would be useful in other directions .",
    "the materials presented here contain only the most basic definitions and proofs of basic properties of torsion of quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "although it was our original intention , we have not yet worked out the details of the application of our theory to the study of links in 3-manifolds . and",
    "the paper is written in a somehow unsophisticated way , trying to cover as much elementary details as possible .",
    "we hope that the reader will tolerate us .",
    "the reader may also notice that our exposition follows quite closely from that of the materials in chapter 1 of turaev s book @xcite . beside the introduction of the notion of torsion of quasi - isomorphism",
    ", there are many technical details in generalizing properties of torsion of acyclic chain complexes to that of quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "we consider these as the main contributions of this paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce basic terminologies and properties used in this paper .",
