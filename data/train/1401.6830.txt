    "the classical sir model is one of the simplest models which describes qualitatively a typical directly transmitted disease outbreak in a populated center , and remains the building block for many , more complicated applied epidemic models .",
    "the population is assumed to consist of three components : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) and removed ( r ) .",
    "models of coupled epidemic centra are of particular interest because they describe epidemic spread through network of populated centra , and hence the overall population is not treated as a homogenous system .",
    "this is a subject of intensive research , we mention here just a few recent publication @xcite not trying to provide an extensive bibliography . the old scenario , known from the middle ages , when the disease propagates locally from a village to the neighboring villages is replaced now by almost instantaneous propagation around the globe .",
    "this phenomena was analyzed in a many papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it was observed that on heterogeneous networks an increase in the movement of population may decrease the size of the epidemic at the steady state , although it increases the chances of outbreak .",
    "this motivates a detailed analysis of migration in inhomogeneous populations .    the coupling between nodes of such a network is mainly caused by migration processes of infectives .",
    "there are several models describing such coupling ( see murray , dg ) , for example , in @xcite the influence of various parameters on the spacial and temporal spread of the disease is studied numerically , with particular focus on the role of quarantine in the form of travel restrictions . in @xcite ,",
    "the so - called diffusion like model is proposed and studied in the framework of a fast migration time approximation .",
    "note that the model in @xcite is a particular case of the diffusion model when the migration time tends to infinity but the coupling coefficient introduced in @xcite tends to zero .    in all these models",
    "the guest population is completely mixed with the host one , so their dynamics is indistinguishable .",
    "nevertheless , a more detailed consideration suggests that while the epidemic dynamics is the same , the migration dynamics should be different , especially if considered as part of a discrete randomized model approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the paper",
    "we start with consideration of the simplest network of only two interacting epidemic sir centra and study in detail the migration processes and their influence on the population dynamics .",
    "moreover , our interest in the model is motivated by the fact that it serves as a hydrodynamic approximation of a natural markov process describing the stochastic dynamics of the system ( cf .",
    "this topic will be explored more fully in a subsequent paper .    to examine the migration model we first consider here the case when epidemic parameters are temporally switched off .",
    "the study of migration in isolation provides a simple tractable model and allows us to specify the parameters in a consistent way .",
    "equally important , this analysis reveals that many models used in the literature ( see eg @xcite ) are unstable in the limit of vanishing infection .",
    "other ones ( see eg @xcite ) remain stable but lead to non - realistic results .",
    "note that even an isolated sir model can not be integrated explicitly , therefore a suitable approximation is required to avoid numerical integration and to obtain practical formulas for outbreak time , fade - out time and other parameters . in our previous works",
    "@xcite the so - called small initial contagion ( sic ) approximation was proposed , based on the assumption that an outbreak in every population center is caused by relatively small number of initially infectives .",
    "this approximation is appropriate when the model is applied to strongly populated centra like urban centra ( i.e.  in the situation when the reaction - diffusion model is not accurate ) .    in the paper",
    "we also show how the model can be generalized on the general network of epidemic centra ( see section 7 ) . as an example a characteristic equation for the travelling wave in a chain of the population centers",
    "is derived and its numerical solution is plotted and analyzed .",
    "consider two populated nodes , 1 and 2 , with populations @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 be the numbers of host susceptibles , infectives and removed , respectively , in node  @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 be numbers of guest susceptibles , infectives and removed , respectively , in node  @xmath10 migrated from node @xmath15 at time @xmath11 .",
    "removed populations @xmath16 , @xmath17 do not affect dynamics of all others in the framework of the standard sir model , and we omit them from consideration here . then , two sir centers ( nodes ) interacting due to the migration of individuals between them are described by the following model : the dynamics of hosts in node @xmath10 obeys the odes @xmath18where @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; and dot denotes the time derivative . here",
    "the term @xmath21 appears due to infectives @xmath22 migrated from node @xmath15 and contributing to the total disease transmission process .",
    "terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe migration fluxes ( rates ) from node @xmath10 to node @xmath15 for susceptibles and infectives , respectively .",
    "terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe return migration fluxes ( rates ) to node @xmath10 for guest individuals in node @xmath15 .",
    "we specify these below .",
    "the dynamics of guests in node @xmath10 temporally arriving from node @xmath15 can be described by analogous odes @xmath27    we assume the migration rate is proportional to the population size in the node from which they emigrate .",
    "so , we approximate the fluxes as@xmath28where @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s are the forward and backward migration coefficients , respectively .",
    "our interest in the dynamical equations presented above is motivated by the fact that they serve as a hydrodynamic approximation of a markov process model . in this context , @xmath29 s can be associated with the transition rate for a host individual to migrate to another node in a unit of time , and @xmath30s  with the transition rate for a guest individual to return to the host node .    clearly , average return rates should be higher : @xmath31 , otherwise an individual would spend most of the time out of the home center .    substituting ( [ eq : mig : rates ] ) into ( [ eq : sn])([eq : in ] ) and ( eq : snm)([eq : inm ] )",
    "yields a closed system of odes : for the hosts in node  @xmath10 @xmath32and for the guests migrated from node @xmath15 into node @xmath10@xmath33evidently , the dynamics of hosts and guests are different .",
    "typical initial conditions for epidemiological problem describe a number of infectives , say @xmath34 that appeared at @xmath35 in node 1 only:@xmath36    the choice for values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 will be explained below in section 3 by considering the migration processes before the epidemic outbreak starts .",
    "consider migration of susceptibles before the epidemic starts in the network .",
    "setting @xmath39 we obtain two decoupled systems of odes for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 describing the pure migration processes in the absence of an outbreak .",
    "say , for the pair @xmath42 we have @xmath43    let migration start at @xmath35 with the initial conditions @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the solution to such an initial value problem is @xmath46where @xmath47 , \\qquad \\",
    "t\\geq 0   \\label{eq : response}\\]]is the response function ( see below ) .",
    "similar formulas are valid for the second pair : @xmath41 . thus , the number of migrants exponentially tends to some limiting values @xmath48these limits represent the dynamic equilibrium of migration processes in the absence of the outbreak . at the equilibrium ,",
    "the forward and backward migrations fluxes compensate each other : @xmath49 .",
    "so , in virtue of ( [ eq : mig : rates ] ) , @xmath50 . substituting @xmath51 and resolving with respect to @xmath52 yields ( [ s12:lim ] ) .",
    "we take the equilibrium values from ( [ s12:lim ] ) as the initial conditions for the outbreak problem , that is reflected in ( [ ode : ini ] ) .",
    "the total populations in any node @xmath53 and @xmath54 are described as@xmath55they can be non - monotonic for some choice of parameters .",
    "next , @xmath56 asymptotically converges to @xmath57if both centra are identical then their total population remains constant .",
    "the migration dynamics described by this model seems reasonable .",
    "the migration process resembles a diffusion process in physics , in which the concentration tends monotonically to an equilibrium .",
    "note that if @xmath58 then @xmath59 , i.e.  only a small share of the population from of node  1 is currently in node  2 ( and vice verse : if @xmath60 then @xmath61 ) , which is appropriate for large population centra .",
    "so , in this approximation @xmath62 .    to understand why function ( [ eq : response ] ) can be associated with a response function , consider a model for which the number of susceptibles can vary even in the absence of migration due to other reasons ( e.g. , birth and death ) .",
    "let @xmath63 be the rate of incoming ( @xmath64 ) or outgoing ( @xmath65 ) individuals , i.e. the external source in the equations @xmath66with initial conditions @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "integrating the second equation in view of relation @xmath51 yields : @xmath69 where the asterisk denotes the convolution , @xmath70 is the derivative of function ( [ eq : response ] ) : recall that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the unit - step heaviside function .",
    "so , @xmath73 is the response in the number of guests in node  2 on the population variation in node  1 .",
    "the most epidemic network models deal with the total number of infectives : @xmath74 , and susceptibles @xmath75 in node @xmath10 . to compare these models take the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ ode : sn ] ) and ( [ ode : in ] ) and obtain the equations @xmath76thus , we can not obtain equations for total numbers of species only : they become coupled with the the equations for guest individuals . even when the number of guests is relatively small @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the approximation @xmath79 , @xmath80 holds , we can not neglect terms with @xmath30 s because @xmath77 , @xmath81 are not always can be valid .",
    "in fact , the terms with @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s may be of the same order .",
    "this complicates the model but makes it more realistic .",
    "many authors simply insert terms proportional to the relevant population size in neighbouring nodes to provide coupling between sir centra : @xmath82where @xmath83 are coupling coefficients ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of pure migration between two centra ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 )",
    "they are reduced to@xmath86note that this model does not guarantee preservation of the total population size because the sum @xmath87 is variable @xmath88which is unrealistic . by eliminating one variable",
    "we see that the system has unstable dynamics@xmath89i.e .",
    ", a growing particular solution .",
    "thus , the traditional approach does not describe the migration between centra properly .",
    "although this instability can potentially be hidden in the background of the outbreak and not be observable in certain epidemic model scenarios .",
    "nevertheless the model can be easily corrected by introducing inverse fluxes ( cf .",
    "@xcite)@xmath90    then for a pure migration model we have@xmath91implying @xmath92 .",

    "thus the dynamics of the corrected model seems to be more realistic but nevertheless does not satisfy an intuitive interpretation of the equilibrium of the migration process .    in @xcite , in order to obtain more realistic migration dynamics , different flux terms are added to equations ( [ ode : sn])([ode : in ] ) in the form of convolutions ( transition terms ) @xmath97where @xmath98 s are the relevant response functions .",

    "the form of these response functions is the same as in ( [ eq : response ] ) obtained solving the initial value problem , see section  [ sec : migration ]    note that for a response function in the form of ( [ ken2 ] ) , the integro - differential equations ( [ eq : sn : response])([eq : in : response ] ) can be reduced to odes .",
    "we introduce additional variables @xmath104 , @xmath105 which aim to capture the number of guests in node @xmath15 coming from node @xmath10 , in agreement with notations used in the present work .",
    "they obey the following odes @xmath106 that can be easily checked .",

    "other useful approximations will be applied in specific situations .",

    "if this is the case , the model can be simplified in the framework of the small initial contagion ( sic ) approximation introduced in @xcite .",
    "in the sic approximation we can split the outbreak process in every node into two stages : ( i ) contamination and ( ii ) the developed outbreak . at the contamination stage ,",
    "the number of infectives is relatively small whereas the total population consists mainly of susceptibles . then on the r.h.s . of ( [ ode : sn])([ode : inm ] ) , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the equations become linear and can be easily analyzed . at the second stage",
    "every node become non - sensitive to small migration processes and the dynamics can be well described by a standard sir process .    in the sic approximation ,",
