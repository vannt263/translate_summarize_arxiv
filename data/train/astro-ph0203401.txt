    "the multiphase chemical evolution model assumes a spherical protogalaxy with a gas mass which collapses to fall onto the equatorial plane forming the disk as a secondary structure .",

    "the infall rate of gas from a halo region to the disk is inversely proportional to a collapse time scale which depends on the total mass being shorter for the more massive galaxies .    the stars in the disks form in two steps : molecular clouds form from the diffuse gas by a schmidt law , and",
    "then cloud - cloud collisions produce stars by a spontaneous process .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 to form clouds or stars by these two processes are assumed to depend on morphological or hubble type t , such as it was found in our previous investigations .",
    "for futher details , see .",
    "under these assumptions , we obtain the radial distributions of diffuse and molecular gas densities , the star formation rate and abundances for 15 elements for each galaxy .    the most important outcome concerns the oxygen abundance : the radial gradient only appears for the intermediate types ( @xmath2 ) at all galaxy masses , being larger for the less massive galaxies . however , the latest ones ( t @xmath3 ) show a flat gradient with abundances @xmath4 7.5 - 8 .",
    "this solves the apparent inconsistency of the largest gradients appearing in late type spirals while some irregulars shows no gradient at all .",
    "results , which can see in fig .",
    "[ oh ] , are in close agreement with observations for hsb , lsb and dwarf galaxies .",
    "variations of the radial gradients of abundances with the morphological type and with the total mass of the galaxy follow the observed correlations ."
