    "failure recovery mechanisms are employed in almost all engineering networks since complex systems of any kind are often prone to failures .",
    "one of the most straightforward and widely used failure recovery mechanism is to simply restart the system and all of the interrupted jobs from the beginning after a failure occurs .",
    "it was first recognized in @xcite that such mechanisms may result in long - tailed ( power law ) delays even if the job sizes and failure rates are exponential . in @xcite , it was noted that the same mechanism is at the core of modern communication networks where retransmissions are used on all protocol layers to guarantee data delivery in the presence of channel failures .",
    "furthermore , @xcite shows that the power law number of retransmissions and delay occur whenever the hazard functions of the data and failure distributions are proportional .",
    "hence , power laws may arise even if the data and channel failure distributions are both gaussian .",
    "in particular , retransmission phenomena can lead to zero throughput and system instabilities , and therefore need to be carefully considered for the design of fault tolerant systems .",
    "more specifically , in communication networks , retransmissions represent the basic building blocks for failure recovery in all network protocols that guarantee data delivery in the presence of channel failures .",
    "these types of mechanisms have been employed on all networking layers , including , for example , automatic repeat request ( arq ) protocol ( e.g. , see section  2.4 of @xcite ) in the data link layer where a packet is resent automatically in case of an error ; contention based aloha type protocols in the medium access control ( mac ) layer that use random backoff and retransmission mechanism to recover data from collisions ; end - to - end acknowledgment for multi - hop transmissions in the transport layer ; http downloading scheme in the application layer , etc .",
    "it has been shown that several well - known retransmission based protocols in different layers of networking architecture can lead to power law delays , e.g. , aloha type protocols in mac layer @xcite and end - to - end acknowledgments in transport layer @xcite as well as in other layers @xcite .",
    "for other ( non - retransmission ) mechanisms that can give rise to heavy tails see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "in particular , the proportional growth / multiplicative models can result in heavy tails @xcite .    traditionally , retransmissions were thought to follow light - tailed distributions ( with rapidly decaying tails ) , namely geometric , which requires the further assumption of independence between data sizes and transmission error probability .",
    "however , these two are often highly correlated in most communication systems , meaning that longer data units have higher probability of error , thus violating the independence assumption .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that , when the data size distribution has infinite support , all retransmission - based protocols could cause heavy - tailed behavior and possibly result in zero throughput , regardless of how light - tailed the distributions of data sizes and channel failures are . nevertheless ,",
    "in reality , data sizes are usually upper bounded .",
    "for example , wavelan s maximum transfer unit is 1500 bytes , youtube videos are of limited duration , e - mail attachments can not exceed an upper limit , say 25 mb , etc .",
    "this fact motivates us to investigate the transmission of bounded data and approximate uniformly the entire body of the resulting retransmission distribution as it transits from the power law to the exponential tail .",
    "we use the following generic channel with failures @xcite to model the preceding situations .",
    "this model was first introduced in @xcite in a different application context .",
    "the channel dynamics is described by the i.i.d .",
    "channel availability process @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where the channel is continuously available during periods @xmath6 and fails between these periods . in each period of time that the channel becomes available , say @xmath7 , we attempt to transmit the data unit of random size @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on the situation when the data size has finite support on interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath10 , we say that the transmission is successful ; otherwise , we wait for the next period @xmath11 when the channel is available and attempt to retransmit the data from the beginning .",
    "it was first recognized in @xcite that this model results in power law distributions when the distributions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 have a matrix exponential representation , and this result was rigorously proved and further generalized in @xcite . a related study when @xmath14 is a constant and failure / arrival rates are time - dependent poisson can be found in @xcite .",
    "it was discovered in @xcite that bounded data units result in truncated power law distributions for the number of retransmissions , see example  3 in @xcite ; see also example  2 in @xcite .",
    "such distributions are characterized by a power law main body and an exponentially bounded tail .",
    "however , the exponential behavior appears only for very small probabilities , often meaning that the number of retransmissions of interest may fall inside the region where the distribution behaves as a power law .",
    "it was argued in example  3 of @xcite that the power law region will grow faster than exponential if the distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath8 are lighter than exponential .",
    "the retransmissions of bounded documents were further studied in @xcite , where partial approximations of the distribution of the number of retransmissions on the logarithmic and exact scales were provided in theorems  1 and 3 of @xcite , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we present a uniform characterization of the entire body of such a distribution , both on the logarithmic as well as the exact scale .    specifically , let @xmath15 represent the number of retransmissions ( until successful transmission ) of a bounded random data unit of size @xmath16 $ ] on the previously described channel . in order to study the uniform approximation in both @xmath2 and @xmath17",
    "we construct a family of variables @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 = \\pr[l \\leq x ] / \\pr[l \\leq \\b]$ ] , for @xmath20 when @xmath21 is fixed .",
    "this scaling of @xmath18 was also used in @xcite .",
    "for the logarithmic scale , our result , stated in theorem  [ thm:2 ] , provides a uniform characterization of the entire body of @xmath22 $ ] , i.e. , informally @xmath23",

    "note that the first term in the preceding approximation corresponds to the power law part @xmath26 of the distribution , while the second part describes the exponential ( geometric @xmath27^n$ ] ) tail .",
    "hence , it may be natural to define the transition point @xmath28 from the power law to the exponential tail as a solution to @xmath29 \\approx \\alpha \\log n_\\b$ ] .",
    "in addition , under more restrictive assumptions , we discover a new exact asymptotic formula for the retransmission distribution that works uniformly for all large @xmath30 .",
    "surprisingly , the approximation admits an explicit form ( see theorems  [ thm:3 ] and  [ thm:4 ] ) @xmath31 \\approx \\frac{\\alpha } { n^\\alpha \\ell(n \\wedge \\pr[a>\\b]^{-1 } ) } \\int_{-n \\log \\pr[a \\leq \\b]}^{\\infty } e^{-z } z^{\\alpha-1 } dz , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a slowly varying function ; note that the preceding integral is the incomplete gamma function @xmath34 .",

    "interestingly , for the special case when @xmath41 is an integer and @xmath42 , one can compute the exact expression for @xmath43 $ ] , see proposition  [ prop : integer ] .",
    "furthermore , our results show that the length of the power law region increases as the corresponding distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath13 assume lighter tails .",
    "all of the preceding results are validated via simulation experiments in section  [ s : sim ] .",
    "it is worth noting that our asymptotic approximations are in excellent agreement with the simulations .",
    "this uniform approximation allows for a characterization of the entire body of the distribution @xmath44 $ ] , so that one can explicitly estimate the region where the power law phenomenon arises . introducing the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath45 $ ]",
    "also provides an assessment method of efficiency and is important for diminishing the power law effects in order to achieve high throughput .",
    "basically , when the power law region is significant , it could lead to nearly zero throughput ( @xmath46 ) , implying that the system parameters should be more carefully adjusted in order to meet the new requirements .",
    "on the contrary , if the exponential tail dominates , the system performance is more desirable",
    ". our analytical work could be applicable in network protocol design , possibly including data fragmentation techniques @xcite and failure - recovery mechanisms .    also ,",
    "from an engineering perspective , our results further suggest that careful re - examination and possible redesign of retransmission based protocols in communication networks might be necessary .",
    "specifically , current engineering trends towards infrastructure - less , error - prone wireless technology encourage the study of highly variable systems with frequent failures . in these types of systems , traditional approaches , e.g. , blind data fragmentation ,",
    "may be insufficient for achieving a good balance between throughput and resource utilization .",
    "for example , ip packets are lower bounded by the packet header of 20 bytes and can not be more than 1500 bytes .",
    "thus , it is not efficient to create very small packets since the 20-byte packet header carries no useful information .",
    "in fact , one may consider merging smaller packets to reduce the overhead and , hence , increase the efficiency .",
    "overall , we consider a generic model when the maximum size of data units is limited , which , in general , can be used towards improving the design of future complex and failure - prone systems in many different applications .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . after a detailed description of the channel model in the next subsection [ s : model ] ,",
    "we present our main results in section [ s : results ] .",
    "then , section  [ s : sim ] contains simulation examples that verify our theoretical work .",
    "a number of technical proofs are postponed to section  [ sec:4 ] .      in this section ,",
    "we formally describe our model and provide necessary definitions and notation .",
    "consider transmitting a generic data unit of random size @xmath18 over a channel with failures . without loss of generality , we assume that the channel is of unit capacity . as stated in the introduction , the channel dynamics is modeled by the channel availability process @xmath47 , where the channel is continuously available during time periods @xmath6 whereas it fails between such periods . in each period of time that the channel becomes available , say @xmath7 , we attempt to transmit the data unit and , if @xmath48 , we say that the transmission was successful ; otherwise , we wait for the next period @xmath11 when the channel is available and attempt to retransmit the data from the beginning .",
