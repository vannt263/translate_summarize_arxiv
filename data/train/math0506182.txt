    "in his proof of andreev s theorem in @xcite , thurston introduced a conformal geometric structure on two - dimensional simplicial complexes which is an analogue of a riemannian metric .",

    "techniques very similar to elliptic partial differential equation techniques were used by y. colin de verdire @xcite to study conformal structures and circle packings .",
    "cooper and rivin in @xcite then defined a version of scalar curvature on three - dimensional simplicial complexes and used it to look at rigidity of sphere packings along the lines of colin de verdire .",
    "inspired by this work , chow and luo @xcite defined several combinatorial ricci flows on two - dimensional simplicial complexes , one for each constant curvature model space .",
    "they were able to show that the flows converge to constant curvature if a circle packing exists whose nerve is the one - skeleton of the triangulation .",
    "the reader is also directed to some later work of luo on how these flows evolve the conformal structure @xcite .",
    "we shall use cooper and rivin s combinatorial scalar curvature to define combinatorial yamabe flow on three - dimensional simplicial complexes which is a three - dimensional analogue of chow and luo s work when the triangles are modeled on euclidean triangles .",
    "we shall look at the evolution of curvature from a geometric viewpoint , understanding the heat equation on curvature which is induced by the flow .",
    "the flow turns out not to be parabolic in the usual sense of laplacians on graphs , an analytic property which we study in a related paper @xcite .",
    "the geometric flow perspective is very much inspired by richard hamilton s works on the ricci flow , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial yamabe flow is a way of studying prescribed scalar curvature on simplicial complexes , which we might call the combinatorial yamabe problem .",
    "the yamabe problem has been studied in great detail ( see @xcite for a good overview ) .",
    "the riemannian case has been solved by the work of aubin @xcite and schoen @xcite .",
    "yamabe flow in the smooth category has been studied by hamilton and others .",

    "let @xmath5 be a simplicial complex of dimension @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath2-dimensional skeleton .",
    "we define a metric structure as a map @xmath8 such that for every edge @xmath9 between vertices @xmath2 and @xmath10 the length of the edge is @xmath11 any such metric structure , or a particular tetrahedron within such a structure , is called conformal and the set of all is called the conformal class .",
    "we can think of this as having an @xmath12-dimensional sphere packing whose nerve is the collection of edges @xmath13 although it is not necessarily an actual sphere packing .",
    "one such conformal tetrahedron is shown in figure [ tetrawithballs ] .",

    "we shall limit ourselves primarily to three dimensions .",

    "* section 3 ) observe that for a collection @xmath23 to determine a euclidean tetrahedron , we can use descartes circle theorem , also called soddy s theorem , which says that four circles in the plane of radii @xmath24 are externally tangent if @xmath25 for a nice proof of soddy s theorem , see @xcite .",
    "we also direct the reader to the interesting article @xcite on descartes circle theorem .",
    "looking at the proof it is clear that if this quantity is negative , then we get three circles which are mutually tangent and a circle in the middle which can not be tangent to all the others , as seen in figure [ circlediagram ] ,    [ ptb ]    and hence we can not form a euclidean tetrahedron from spheres of these radii . if @xmath26 is positive , we can form a euclidean tetrahedron corresponding to @xmath27 so our condition for nondegeneracy of the tetrahedron is @xmath28 we call @xmath26 the nondegeneracy quadratic . as noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 793 ) , @xmath26 is really @xmath29 divided by the square of the radius of the sphere tangent to each of the edges ( the circumscripted sphere ) , and is related to the volume in the following way : @xmath30 thus if we consider the formula for the square of the volume as formal , the nondegeneracy condition is that @xmath31    now we shall define a quantity @xmath32 called the curvature . for a euclidean tetrahedron with vertices",
    "@xmath33 we define the solid angle @xmath34 at a vertex @xmath2 as the area of the triangle on the unit sphere cut out by the planes determined by @xmath35 where @xmath2 is the center of the sphere .",

    "if we define @xmath36 as the dihedral angle in the tetrahedron @xmath33 along the edge @xmath37 which is also an angle of the aforementioned spherical triangle , the gauss - bonnet theorem gives the formula for the solid angle as @xmath38 note that solid angles @xmath34 are symmetric in the last three indices and dihedral angles @xmath36 are symmetric in the first two and in the last two indices",
    ". we can now define the curvature @xmath39 at a vertex @xmath2 as @xmath40 note that the sum is over @xmath41 since the vertex @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the curvature @xmath39 can be thought of as a scalar curvature since it measures the difference at a given vertex between the total angles in euclidean space and the total angles of the complex .",
    "it was initially looked at by cooper - rivin in @xcite .",
    "they found that a metric structure can not be deformed ( staying conformal ) while keeping the scalar curvature constant .",
    "constant scalar curvature is a critical point of the total curvature functional @xmath42 cooper - rivin showed that the space of nondegenerate simplices is not convex , but that the function @xmath43 is weakly concave as a function of the @xmath44 and strongly concave if the condition @xmath45 is imposed .",
    "we can not use this to show that there is a unique constant scalar curvature metric on a given conformal class , but any constant scalar curvature metric is a local minimum of @xmath46    another way to prove this is to look at the functional @xmath43 as a function of @xmath47 then the set of nondegenerate simplices is convex since it is the intersection of a cone with a half - space .",
    "however , upon computing the hessian of @xmath43 we can only prove that the function is concave in a neighborhood of constant curvature .",
    "much like scalar curvature in the smooth case , there may be several constant scalar curvature metrics in a given conformal class .",
    "however , we have yet to find a complex admitting two constant scalar curvature metrics .",
    "[ vertex transitive remark]just because a topological manifold admits a constant sectional curvature @xmath48 metric , a given triangulation of that manifold may not admit a metric with curvature @xmath49 for any vertex transitive triangulation , i.e. a triangulation such that the same number of tetrahedra meet at every vertex , the triangulation with @xmath50 for all @xmath51 @xmath52 is constant curvature .",
    "if @xmath53 is the degree of the vertex , i.e. the number of tetrahedra meeting at each vertex , the curvature must be @xmath54 hence in order for the curvature to be zero , @xmath55 thus no vertex transitive triangulation of the torus admits a zero curvature metric . this observation is similar to the one noted in @xcite about dynamical triangulations .",
    "the curvature considered here is different than the one considered in the regge calculus by regge @xcite and others ( for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our curvature is concentrated at the vertices while regge s curvature is concentrated at the edges in dimension 3 .",
    "the solid angle which we use is reminiscent of the interpretation of ricci curvature as solid angle deficit ( see , for instance , the introduction of @xcite ) .",
    "we now define combinatorial yamabe flow on the metric structure as @xmath56 for each @xmath57 note how similar this looks to the yamabe flow on riemannian manifolds , which is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the riemannian metric and @xmath60 is its scalar curvature .",
    "in particular , both preserve their respective conformal class .",
    "we use the term ` combinatorial ' since this is used by chow and luo , but it is really more of a piecewise linear or piecewise euclidean flow because it depends on the geometry of the triangulation and not just the topological , or combinatorial , structure . much like the yamabe flow and ricci flow , the evolution of curvature will play a key role in understanding the behavior of this equation .",
    "next we shall compute this evolution .    recall the schlfli formula , which , for a euclidean tetrahedron denoted by the complex @xmath61 gives that @xmath62 ( see milnor @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "we can reorganize this as cooper - rivin @xcite do to get @xmath63 or @xmath64 since there are only four vertices in @xmath65 we may denote the solid angle at vertex @xmath2 by @xmath66 without fear of confusion .",

    "we also need the face angles .",

    "if we define the curvature of a surface to be @xmath90 then the formula for evolution of the face angles implies that the evolution of curvature is in fact parabolic in the usual sense of laplacians on graphs ( this is studied in greater detail in @xcite ) .",

    "z. he looked at variations of the type we are studying , that is @xmath113 in the two dimensions @xcite .",
    "he then derived a curvature evolution which involved a combinatorial laplacian .",
