    "the search for an efficient optical quantum memory and its implementation for quantum networks is an active area ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the role of carrier of information  flying q - bit  in such devices is played by a single photon and the most natural way to encode the q - bit is provided by its two polarization degrees of freedom ( see @xcite for some recent proposals ) . while in the majority of the proposed schemes the photon quantum state is mapped to the quantum state of some atomic ensemble @xcite , in the experiment @xcite the photon polarization q - bit",
    "was recorded in the superposition of magnetic substates of the long - lived degenerate level of a single rubidium atom .",
    "such single - atom quantum memory offers an advantage of processing of the stored quantum information . since at the storage stage",
    "the state of a single atom , in which the photon q - bit is encoded , is well determined , it may be altered in a controlled way , e.g. , by some laser pulse , so that the state of the retrieved photon will differ from that of the recorded one in a desirable way implementing thus the performance of quantum gates .",
    "the setup employed in @xcite for the photon storage and retrieval was based on the same technique of vacuum stimulated raman scattering involving adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , which was previously successfully employed for deterministic single photon emission @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the three - level @xmath0 - type atom was trapped inside the high - finesse cavity , one branch of the atomic @xmath0 - type transitions was coupled to the quantized cavity field , while the other one was coupled to the driving coherent laser field .",
    "the stirap with the three - level atom with non - degenerate levels is well described in the reviews and textbooks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in case of non - degenerate levels there exists the only dark state  the superposition of the ground state @xmath1 and some metastable state @xmath2  uncoupled to the excited level @xmath3 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "in course of raman scattering the atom is adiabatically transferred from the initial state @xmath2 to the target state @xmath1 .",
    "the stirap with degenerate atomic levels and with classical coherent resonant fields was studied in @xcite , were it was shown that unlike the non - degenerate case the population from the initial state @xmath2 is not always totally transferred to the target level @xmath1 .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to analyze the process of storage and retrieval of a single - photon polarization q - bit by means of stirap through the atoms with degenerate levels for arbitrary values of the angular momenta of resonant atomic levels and to study the dependence of the probability of long - term photon storage on the polarization of the driving field and on the initial atomic state .    in section 2 the interaction model",
    "is described and the instantaneous eigenvectors of the interaction operator , which determine the evolution operator in the adiabatic approximation , are constructed . in case of degenerate levels there appear the new types of these eigenvectors , non - existing in case of non - degenerate levels , like the dark states , which atomic part belongs to only one of the lower levels @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and the bright states , which couple the excited level @xmath3 with only one of the lower levels @xmath1 or @xmath2 . in section 3 the formula for the probability of long - term storage of the photon polarization q - bit",
    "is obtained and the conditions for the photon storage with unit probability independent on its polarization are outlined .",
    "the transitions with the angular momenta @xmath4 , @xmath5 , corresponding to the transitions between the hyperfine structure components of the electronic levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the @xmath8 atom , which were employed in the experiments @xcite , are analyzed .",
    "we consider the three - level @xmath0 - type atom in a high - finesse cavity , one branch ",
    "the transition @xmath9 with the frequency @xmath10 is coupled to the driving coherent laser field , while the other  the transition @xmath11 with the frequency @xmath12 is coupled to the quantized cavity field ( figure 1 ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the values of the angular momenta of the levels .",
