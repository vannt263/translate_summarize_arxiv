    "of the known massive stars in our galaxy , is possibly the largest and finest example of a pre - hypernova candidate , presenting a rare but exceptional opportunity to test our current understanding of stellar evolution in the upper hertzsprung - russell diagram . yet , this gem is not without its flaws as , since the `` great eruption '' which formed the homunculus nebula and the more recent eruption which formed the little homunculus @xcite , has been enshrouded by a dusty cocoon which complicates observations in the uv and optical .",
    "fortunately , is extremely bright at x - ray wavelengths which suffer less from extinction , thus providing an invaluable probe of the inner nebula .",
    "the exceptional monitoring of at x - ray wavelengths @xcite has characterised the periodic variability as indicative of a highly eccentric ( @xmath0 ) , long - period ( @xmath1yr ) binary system ( table  [ tab : system_parameters ] ) .",
    "the binary hypothesis appears to be well supported by theoretical models @xcite , as well as by observations at infrared @xcite , radio @xcite , optical @xcite , far ultra - violet @xcite , and @xmath2ray wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",

    "the observed x - ray lightcurve displays the general characteristics expected from a high orbital eccentricity colliding winds binary , but has some puzzling features .",
    "for instance , the most recent x - ray minimum was considerably shorter than the extended minima observed in previous cycles @xcite .",
    "the exact cause of the x - ray minimum is a matter of debate ( for an overview of some of the possibilities see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet it is now clear that models must also be able to account for the observed cycle - to - cycle variation .    the nature of the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) has recently been investigated with 3d models . using a smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) model of the wind - wind collision",
    ", @xcite found that they could match the extended x - ray minimum .",
    "in contrast , adopting the 3d dynamical model of @xcite , @xcite showed that when the spatial extent of the x - ray emission region and energy dependence of the emission and absorption were taken into consideration , the width of the observed x - ray minimum could not be reproduced by an eclipse of the x - ray emitting plasma alone .",
    "furthermore , models with the preshock stellar winds at terminal velocity over - predicted the observed x - ray emission in the 7 - 10 kev band by an order of magnitude , indicating that a reduction in the preshock speed of the companion star s wind is required .",
    "such a reduction is plausible , as the highly eccentric orbit causes the wcr to enter into the wind acceleration region of the companion star around periastron passage . considering the immense luminosity of the primary star ,",
    "the acceleration of the companion s wind may also be significantly inhibited .",
    "a reduction in the preshock velocity will cause radiative cooling to become increasingly important in the postshock companion s wind , and will affect the stability of the wcr @xcite .",
    "in fact , a ram pressure balance between the stellar winds may be lost and the shock may collapse onto the companion star @xcite . in this case the 7 - 10  kev flux which originates predominantly from the apex of the wcr would be quenched , a feature which is necessary in models aiming to explain the extended x - ray minimum .",
    "however , it is unclear why a collapse of the wcr ( if one occured ) would be of a much shorter duration in the most recent periastron passage whilst being extended in previous cycles .    in this paper",
    "we describe our results from a suite of three dimensional ( 3d ) simulations in which we have implemented radiative driving , gravity , orbital motion , and optically thin radiative cooling , allowing the rle of wind acceleration , interacting radiation fields , and instabilities in the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) on the gas dynamics and resulting x - ray emission to be explored .",
    "we first present simulations with static stars at a separation corresponding to periastron passage .",
    "the turbulent , highly unstable nature of the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) is revealed , and results show that when the acceleration regions of the stars are considered the conditions in the postshock gas permit the growth of powerful non - linear thin - shell instabilities ( ntsi - * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent vigorous oscillations lead to the collision of dense fragments of the wcr against the companion star .",
    "importantly , the 7 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity shows a marked reduction when compared to an equivalent simulation which neglects the wind acceleration .",
    "we then perform large - scale , high resolution simulations which include the orbital motion of the stars , and find that the rapid orbital motion of the stars around periastron acts to : reduce the degree of radiative inhibition of the preshock companion star s wind .",
    "consequently , the catastrophic disruption of the wcr seen in the static stars simulation is not reproduced .",
    "we conclude that the behaviour of the observed x - ray emission from around periastron is tied to the rate of radiative cooling in the postshock companion s wind",
    ". the suppression of the preshock companion s wind by radiative inhibition ( albeit with a stronger radiation - wind coupling than explored in this work ) could be an important trigger for rapid cooling .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the observed short and long duration x - ray minima may be due to the companion s postshock gas conditions lying close to the dividing line between instability growth which merely perturbs the wcr , and far more vigorous ntsis which destroy it ( possibly causing the wcr to collapse onto the companion star in the process ) .",
    "the latter case may explain the longer observed minima .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : a description of the hydrodynamic model and the x - ray emission calculations are given in ",
    "[ sec : model ] . in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] we review some theoretical background relevant to our current investigation . the results of the hydrodynamic simulations are presented in   [ sec : periastron ] ( static stars at periastron separation ) , and   [ sec : orbit ] ( large - scale orbit ) .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , and we close with our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ]",
    ".        the influence of the orbital acceleration on the mass - loss rate and velocity profile of the wind can be estimated by incorporating @xmath4 and @xmath5 into the equation of motion @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance from the centre of the star along the line - of - centres , @xmath8 is the speed of sound , @xmath9 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath10 is the orbital acceleration . the radiative line force , @xmath11 takes the form of eq .",
    "[ eqn : ri ] .",
    "the value of @xmath12 at a given radius will depend on the time at which that parcel of gas left the star .",
    "however , as we are mainly interested in the affect of orbital motion on the base of the wind ( i.e. where we initiate the winds in the hydrodynamic simulations ) , we neglect the radial dependence of @xmath12 , and take @xmath13 . as the orbital acceleration is applied to the base of the wind we replace the @xmath14 in the denominator of eqs .",
    "[ eqn : gcen ] and [ eqn : gloc ] with @xmath15 .",
    "note that we do not use @xmath16 in the denominator as this would introduce an unrealistic singularity at the centre of mass of the binary system .",

    "the orbital motion terms , which only depend on @xmath7 , are contained in the potential function , @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the critical point of the wind profile is solved for using : i ) the equation of motion @xmath29 , ii ) the singularity condition @xmath30 , and iii ) the regularity condition @xmath31 .",
    "the velocity gradient terms present in the fdcfs ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : fdcf_ri1 ] and [ eqn : fdcf_ri2 ] ) require the solution for the wind profile to be attained using an iterative process , whereby monotonic fdcfs are used to attain an initial solution , then velocity gradient terms are included in subsequent iterations @xcite .",

    "[ eqn : ri ] , whereas in the hydrodynamic simulations @xmath11 has the form of eq .  [ eqn : ri2 ] .",
    "hence , these calculations are intended to illustrate the qualitative effect of orbital acceleration on the wind .",
    "the inclusion of orbital motion slightly steepens the velocity profile close to the star .",
    "this is the opposite effect to stellar rotation , which causes a shallower velocity profile @xcite .",
    "interestingly , neglecting radiative inhibition , the terminal wind velocity is lower when orbital motion is included .",
    "however , when radiative inhibition is included , and recalling that the wcr occurs at @xmath33 from the companion star ( at periastron and along the line of centres ) in model orbit - rd , there is a minor increase in the preshock velocity .",
    "examining the critical point radius and mass - loss rate we find reduction factors of 0.12 % and 2.3 % , respectively .",
    "therefore , orbital acceleration contributes a negligible difference in comparison to the interplay between the radiation fields and the gravity of the stars ."
