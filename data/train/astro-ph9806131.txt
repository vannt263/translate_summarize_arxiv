    "broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos are the main manifestation of agn outflows .",
    "bals are associated with prominent resonance lines such as c iv @xmath11549 , si iv @xmath11397 , n v @xmath11240 , and ly@xmath0@xmath11215 .",
    "they appear in about 10% of all quasars ( foltz et al .",
    "1990 ) with typical velocity widths of @xmath2 km  s@xmath3  ( weymann , turnshek , & christiansen 1985 ; turnshek 1988 ) and terminal velocities of up to 50,000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the small percentage of balqsos among quasars is generally interpreted as an orientation effect , and it is probable that the majority of quasars and other types of agn harbor intrinsic outflows ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the spectrum of pg 0946 + 301 which is a typical high ionization balqso .",
    "establishing the physical properties of the flow by determining the ionization equilibrium and abundances ( iea ) of the bal material is a fundamental issue in balqsos studies .",
    "furthermore , such determinations are powerful probes of abundances in the entire agn environment .",
    "inferences about the iea in the bal region are derived by trying to simulate bal ionic - column - densities ( @xmath4 ) using photoionization codes .",
    "several groups ( korista et al . 1996 ; turnshek et al . 1996 ; hamann 1996 ) have used extracted @xmath4 from hst observations of balqso 02261024 ( korista et al .",
    "1992 ) in their iea studies while introducing innovative theoretical approaches to the problem . however , these works used the bal _",
    "apparent _ optical depths ( defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the residual intensity seen in the trough ) to determine their @xmath4 .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the _ apparent _ optical depths in the bals can not be directly translated to realistic @xmath4 unless the covering factor and level of saturation are known .",
    "arav ( 1997 ) demonstrated that in balqso 02261024 the optical depths in the major bals are identical within measurement errors .",
    "the probability of such occurrence by coincidence is less than 1% , which strongly suggests that although these bals are not black , they are all saturated .",
    "if the bals are saturated , the inferred @xmath4 are only lower limits , and thus the conclusions regarding the iea in this object ( i.e. , very high metalicity in the flows ; turnshek et al .",
    "1996 ) , and by extension in all balqsos , are very uncertain . evidence for saturation and partial covering factor in the outflows are also seen in the spectra of q044913 ( barlow 1997 ) and pg 1254 + 047 ( hamann 1998 ) , and in spectropolarimetry data ( cohen , m. h. , et al .",
    "1995 ; hines & wills 1995 ) .",
    "this , along with the lack of even a single case where we can say with confidence that saturation is negligible , makes it likely that saturation affects most ( if not all ) observed balqsos .",
    "thus it has become evident that an iea analysis based on apparent @xmath4 is unreliable and that it is necessary to account for saturation and partial covering . since these effects are velocity dependent , a detailed study of the optical depth as a function of velocity [ @xmath7 is essential .",
    "such an analysis requires much higher s / n data than the apparent @xmath4 approach .",
    "this is currently feasible only for exceptionally uv - bright balqsos by using long integration times .",
    "observing many objects with a s / n level similar to that of available data is of limited use for these studies .",
    "in addition to much higher s / n data , a wide uv spectral coverage is needed to cover lines that arise from the same ion , which yield the best saturation diagnostics .",
    "a broad uv coverage also yields many lines from different ions of the same element , which are crucial for separating effects of ionization and abundances .",
    "these requirements demand the widest possible spectral coverage and can be achieved by combining fuse , hst / stis and ground based observations .",
    "such broad - wavelength observations yield more than one bal for the ions n  iii , o  iii , o  iv , si  iv and s  iv , and bals from multiple ions for seven elements ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s ) .",
    "the best way to measure saturation is by a careful study of different bals from the same ion . by doing",
    "so we obtain two or more diagnostics about precisely the same component of the outflowing gas . in the case of pg  0946 + 301 , we have the following bals from the same ion in the combined hst - fuse spectral coverage : three n  iii bals associated with transitions at 991  , 685  , and 452  . based on their atomic parameters ( verner , verner , & ferland 1996 )",
    ", the expected optical depth ratio between these line should be 9:20:1 , respectively .",
    "these optical depth ratios give us great dynamical range in trying to quantify the level of saturation in the lines .",
    "other ions also have more than one bal : o  iv 789  , 609   and 554  , with @xmath8 ratios of 2:1:5 ; si  iv 1397   and 458  , with @xmath946:1 ; s  iv 1070  , 814  , 750   and 660  , with @xmath10 . the case of o  iii",
    "is somewhat unique since its lines ( 835  , 703   and 508  ) have similar intrinsic optical depths @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , these bals can not be used as saturation diagnostics . instead they are useful in fixing the true level of the continuum and for checking the self - consistency of the @xmath12 solution algorithm .",
    "three years ago we began a program to study the iea in balqsos using hst archival spectra .",
    "we have analyzed the available hst ( and ground - based ) spectra of pg  0946 + 301 ( arav et al .",
    "our main effort was devoted to a detailed study of @xmath12 in the bals . for this analysis we developed a new algorithm to solve for the optical depth as a function of velocity for doublets and multiplets .",
    "@xmath12 for a few lines are shown in figure [ 3tau ] .",
    "we found convincing evidence for saturation in segments of the troughs , especially in component b which is seen in all bals .",
    "this supports our previous assertion that saturation is common in bals and therefore cast doubts on claims for very high metalicity in bal flows .",
    "we found differing covering factors for high vs. low ionization bals and large differences in ionization as a function of velocity between different bals . by comparing the available data of pg  0946 + 301 to those of all other balqsos in the hst archive ,",
    "it became obvious that this object is by far a better candidate for iea studies than any other known balqso .",
    "* advantages of pg  0946 + 301 *    * pg  0946@xmath13301 is the brightest balqso in the uv with 510 times higher flux between 12502500  ( observed frame ) than the second best candidate ( q02261024 ) . *",
    "it is a fairly typical balqso in terms of luminosity and optical / uv spectrum and therefore conclusions about its iea should be representative of the whole class .",
    "* the bals of pg  0946@xmath13301 are somewhat narrower than those of other possible candidate , and therefore blend less with each other across the spectrum .",
    "* we can obtain very high - quality data for an unprecedented rest frame spectral region ( 400  1700   ) , with very small contamination by ly@xmath0forest lines due to the low redshift of the object .",
    "roughly 30 qso researchers have teamed up in an international - collaboration dedicated to this multiwavelength campaign .",
    "our aim is to obtain : hst uv spectroscopy , fuse uv spectroscopy , asca x - ray data , high - resolution optical spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry .",
    "each of these observations will yield important information by itself , but it is the combined constraints that will give the most powerful iea diagnostics .",
    "a 100 ksec asca observation has already been approved , a 100 ksec fuse proposal has recently been submitted and an hst / stis proposal of roughly 40 orbits will be submitted in cycle 8 .      *",
    "hst * : we expect the highest quality data to come from hst observations totaling @xmath14 orbits . in the far uv ( 550800rest - frame ) a thirty orbit observation with the stis g140l grating should give 6 - 8 times better s / n combined with roughly three times higher resolution than the available data ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) . this superb data will allow us to extract @xmath15 for 8 important bals in that region , which is not possible with the data in hand .",
    "ten orbits with the g230l grating will give same epoch data with three times the s / n of the available data between 8001450  .",
    "this division of observing time should yield data with s / n@xmath16 across more than 80% of whole hst uv band ( 11503200  observed - frame ) .",
    "the instrument - related details of the observations and the data reduction will be handled by mike crenshaw ( gsfc ) who is a member of the stis team .",
    "* fuse * ( far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) : within the spectral coverage of fuse ( 400530  in the object s rest - frame ) we expect to find bals that can serve as unique saturation diagnostics ( si  iv  @xmath1458 and",
    "n  iii  @xmath1452 ) , which combined with hst data will enable us to determine saturation levels up to fifty times the apparent optical depth .",
    "bals from very high ionization states ( si  xii and s  xiv ) will give information about material in similar ionization states to the `` warm absorbers '' seen in seyfert galaxies and quasars . and",
    "bals from five ions of neon .",
    "the instrument - related details of the observations and the data reduction will be handled by mark giroux ( university of colorado ) who is a part of the fuse team .",
    "* asca * : x - ray data give us the only direct information about the shape of the ionizing continuum beyond @xmath17 30 ev , which is vital for constraining the ionization equilibrium .",
    "unlike optical / uv data , the absorption seen in the x - ray data is mainly due to bound - free opacity , whereas the optical / uv absorption data is due to bound - bound opacity ( i.e. , lines ) .",
    "therefore , additional diagnostics which are much less sensitive to saturation effects will be obtained by analysis of the x - ray data .",
    "we have an approved program for a 100 ksec asca observation of pg  0946 + 301 ( pi paul green ) .",
    "* optical * : in the optical regime it is important to obtain a very high s / n data of the c  iv  @xmath1  1549 bal ( which is the only one observable from the ground ) with a high spectral resolution . from these data an accurate optical depth template can be extracted and compared with all the uv bals in order to find ionization differences across the troughs .",
    "it is also beneficial to obtain spectropolarimetry from the ground .",
    "polarized light gives us information about an indirect photon trajectory through the bal region which provides valuable information about the geometry of the absorbing gas .",
