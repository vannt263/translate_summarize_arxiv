    "a significant progress in the understanding of the mechanisms for the production of heavy quarkonium consisting of two heavy quarks with different flavors , for instance , @xmath3-system , has been achieved during past three years @xcite .",
    "one clarified that for the @xmath0 production in @xmath4-annihilation , the differential cross - section has the simple factorized form in the limit of high energies ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the born cross - section for the @xmath9-pair production , @xmath10 is the transverse momentum of @xmath11-quark , @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of @xmath0 meson , and @xmath13 is interpreted as the fragmentation function of @xmath14 . in the language of feynmann diagrams ,",
    "the latter fact means that in the high energy limit one can conveniently choose a gauge , namely the axial gauge , with the unit @xmath15 vector directed along the four - momentum of the @xmath16-quark , so that the contribution of the diagrams where the @xmath17-pair is produced off the @xmath11-quark line is dominant .",
    "using this fact , one analytically calculated the fragmentation functions for the bound states in @xmath18- , @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath21-quarkonium in hadronic , photonic and photon - gluon interactions occurs in a more complex way and it can not be described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the entire kinematical region even at high energies @xmath5 .",
    "the number of diagrams for the mentioned processes is greater than that in @xmath4-annihilation ( one has 36 diagrams for the gluonic interactions , 20 for the photonic collisions and 24 for the photon - gluon subprocess ) .",
    "so , one can find no gauge to restrict the number of dominant diagrams by those of the fragmentation kinds , i.e. , by diagrams like 15 or 18 in fig .",
    "1 , where the tree process @xmath22 is presented .",
    "the origin of the problem is that the recombination diagrams also contribute to the cross - section , for example , diagram 5 in fig .",
    "1 is of this kind .",
    "this contribution is essential up to the transverse momentum values equal to 35 gev . at @xmath23 gev ,",
    "the regime of fragmentation ( 1 ) becomes dominant , as one must expect by the theorem on the hard process factorization @xcite .",
    "however , the latter fact underlines the calculations of the contributions , determined by the complete set of diagrams .",
    "the complete perturbative calculations can lead to a possible interference of various contributions in some kinematical regions .",
    "so , detailed analysis for the gluonic production of @xmath0 mesons at high energies was performed by us @xcite .",
    "we found that the effect of destructive interference between the fragmentation diagrams and the ones containing the three - gluon vertex is important , so that in the region of @xmath24 close to @xmath25 and at moderate @xmath12 values the complete set of diagrams leads to smaller cross - section in comparison with the one calculated according to ( 1 ) @xcite .",
    "we also found that for the photon - photon interaction the interference is absent .",
    "these investigations lead us to the conclusion that destructive interference takes place if the interaction possesses the nonabelian character .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the production of @xmath0 meson in the gluon - photon interactions , wherein the mentioned interference would result in the forward - backward asymmetry , which is described in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward comparison of experimental measurements with the fragmentation picture is problematic since the condition @xmath26 is generally not satisfied in partonic subprocesses , and the dominant contribution to the cross - section is integrated over the region close to the threshold of the meson production in the subprocess . in this work the cross - section of @xmath0 production in the hera experiments will be presented . despite the dominance of the kinematical region near the subprocess threshold ,",
    "the effect caused by the presence of the three - gluon vertices , i.e. the nonabelian texture of qcd , turns out to be significant .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath0 meson production , @xmath27 , can be expressed through the amplitude of four free quarks production , @xmath28 , and the orbital wave function of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath29 , in the meson rest frame as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the total spin of the meson and its projection on @xmath24 axis in the @xmath0 rest frame , respectively ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the orbital momentum and its projection ; @xmath18 and @xmath35 are the sum of quark spins and its projection ; @xmath36 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients ; @xmath37 are four - momenta of @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the three - momentum of @xmath11 quark in the @xmath0 meson rest frame ; @xmath40 is the four - momentum , obtained from the four - momentum @xmath41 by the lorentz transformation from the @xmath0 rest frame to the system , where the calculation of @xmath28 is performed .",
    "then , the four - momenta of @xmath11 and @xmath42 quarks , forming the @xmath0 meson , will be determined by the following formulae with the accuracy up to @xmath43 terms @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the quark masses , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "let us note that for the @xmath18-wave states it is enough to take into account only terms independent of @xmath39 .",
    "the 24 diagrams , contributing to the gluon - photon production of @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "the product of spinors @xmath49 , corresponding to the @xmath11 and @xmath42 quarks in the amplitude @xmath28 of eq.([int ] ) , should be substituted by the projection operator @xmath50 where @xmath51 for @xmath52 , or @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the polarization vector for the spin - triplet state .",
    "the fact that the @xmath56-system is produced in the colour - singlet state simplifies the texture of colour matrix .",
    "the latter has the only nonzero eigenvalue for the given process , so that one can significantly reduce the time for the computation of the matrix element .",
    "the @xmath18-wave production amplitude can be written down as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the radial wave function at the origin , so that @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the quantity @xmath61 is related to the leptonic decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector @xmath0 states @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the vector and axial - vector currents of the constituent quarks . in the lowest order in @xmath65 one",
    "has @xmath66 .",
    "the account for hard gluon corrections in the first order in @xmath65 @xcite results in @xmath67\\;,\\\\ \\tilde f & = & f_p\\ ; \\bigg[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_s^h}{\\pi } \\biggl(\\frac{m_2-m_1}{m_2+m_1}\\ln\\frac{m_2}{m_1 } - 2\\biggr)\\bigg]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 are the masses of the quarks composing the quarkonium . for the vector currents of quarks with equal masses , the blm procedure of scale fixing in the `` running '' coupling constant of qcd @xcite gives ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath69 the estimates of the @xmath61 value within the potential models and qcd sum rules are somewhat uncertain , @xmath70 mev @xcite .",
    "recent estimates within the qcd sum rules and in the framework of lattice computations give @xmath71 mev and @xmath72 mev , respectively .",
    "taking into account radiative corrections , the value of @xmath61 is about @xmath73 mev @xcite , which will be used in the following estimates .",
    "since the cross - section is proportional to @xmath74 , the corresponding value of the cross - section for a different value of @xmath61 can be obtained by rescaling with the multiplicative factor @xmath75 .",
    "in the leading order of perturbation theory , the total cross - section for the photon - gluon production of @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , @xmath65 and masses of quarks are free parameters of the model .",
    "the calculations are performed with the following values of the parameters @xmath78 the results for the gluon - photon production of @xmath18-wave levels in the @xmath21-quarkonium ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) are presented in fig . 2 and tab .",
    "1 . for the sake of comparison , the predictions of the fragmentation mechanism",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "2 . one can see that the fragmentation mechanism underestimates the cross - section , much the same way as in the photonic and gluonic interactions producing @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the distributions @xmath79 for both the @xmath0 meson moving in the gluon hemisphere ( i.e. at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the projection of the momentum on the beam axis in the c.m.s . of the colliding particles ) and @xmath0 moving in the photon hemisphere , are shown in fig .",
    "3 . according to the fragmentation model , the mesons are produced symmetrically in both the hemispheres , so that the distributions over @xmath24 are described by the expression @xmath82 at @xmath83 as well as at @xmath84 .",
    "however , one can see that the real picture of production is more complex .",
    "first , the large enhancement compared to the predictions of the fragmentation model is found in the region of low @xmath24 for both the hemispheres .",
    "second , a significant asymmetry takes place for @xmath85 .",
    "both effects are caused by the following reasons . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the first reason is the contribution of diagrams like the diagram 20 in fig .",
    "1 . in the leading order of perturbation theory",
    "the latter contribution corresponds to the `` resolved '' photon split into the pair of charmed quarks , so that one of those recombines with the produced @xmath11-quark to form the @xmath0-meson .",
    "taking into the ratioof the quark charges @xmath86 , this mechanism causes the increase of @xmath0-production cross - section in the photon hemisphere .",
    "the second reason is the destructive interference between the @xmath11-quark fragmentation and the contribution caused by the three - gluon vertices appearing in the splitting of initial gluon inside the cone of the latter ( see diagrams 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 22 and 3 , 4 ) .",
    "this is why the essential decrease of @xmath0-production cross - section occurs in the gluon hemisphere .",
    "the distributions @xmath87 for the forward and backward hemispheres ( @xmath80 and @xmath88 , respectively ) are presented in fig . 4 for the @xmath0 state .",
    "one can see that these distributions differ from the ones obtained in the fragmentation model at low transverse momenta . in the region of high @xmath12 ,",
    "where the fragmentation mechanism dominates , the deviation becomes small , as one expects .",
    "comparing figs . 3 and 4 , one can draw the conclusion that the difference between the production cross - sections in the two hemispheres is most significant at large @xmath24 and low @xmath12 .",
    "our calculations show that the same conclusion is valid for the production of the excited vector state @xmath1 .",
    "the considered interactions between the monochromatic beams of gluons and photons do not occur in a real experiment . to clarify whether one can observe the asymmetry in @xmath2 or @xmath89 experiments or not , the process of @xmath2-interaction at hera ( @xmath90 gev ) is considered .",
    "for this purpose , the cross - section of the gluon - photon subprocess has been convoluted with the structure functions of both the photon in electron and the gluon in proton , respectively .",
    "the equivalent photon parameterization in @xcite has been chosen as the photonic structure function .",
    "the cteq4 functions have been used for the gluon distributions @xcite .    the rapidity distribution normalized to unity is shown in fig . 5 for the production of @xmath1 .",
    "for comparison , we have also presented the distribution with a constant matrix element , @xmath91 .",
    "one can see that the differential cross - section for @xmath1 production is strongly displaced in comparison with the distribution calculated with the constant matrix element .",
    "therefore , the effect of destructive interference , which has been found at high energies of the @xmath92 subprocess , survives in the real conditions of interaction at hera , too . on the other hand , in the fragmentation regime at high @xmath12",
    "the asymmetry must tend to zero .",
    "the latter practically occurs in fig .",
    "6 , wherein the cross - section @xmath93 at @xmath94 gev is shown in comparison with the distribution for the constant matrix element at the same cut off , @xmath94 gev .    summarizing the results above , one can conclude that the effect of the forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath95-meson distribution @xmath93 is basically related with the nonabelian texture of qcd , and this asymmetry is determined by the three - gluon vertex .    as has been mentioned above",
    ", the total cross - section of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at the hera facilities is about to @xmath96 pb including charge - conjugate states .",
    "the vector @xmath1 state decays to the ground @xmath0 meson through the emission of a @xmath97-quantum in the m1-radiative transition , which has the branching ratio close to 100% @xcite .",
    "so , at the hera luminosity @xmath98 the calculated value of the cross - section will give only 400 events with the @xmath0 meson per year .",
    "the increase of total energy by three times , which correspond to the combination of lep and lhc accelerators , will result in the enhancement of the asymmetry as well as the total cross - section , which is estimated to have a value of 6 nb at @xmath99 gev ( see fig . 7 ) . at the luminosity",
    "@xmath100 one can expect about @xmath101 @xmath95 events per year .",
    "taking into account low branching fractions for the exclusive decay modes of @xmath0 ( for example , @xmath102 ) and the efficiency for the detecting of decay process ( @xmath103 ) , one can see that the expected number of events can turn out to be insufficient for the investigation of the described asymmetry in the @xmath2-production of @xmath0 meson .",
    "the study of these nonabelian effects is a more real problem for the production of @xmath104 meson .",
    "as we can see above , the asymmetry is caused by quite similar deviation from the fragmentation mechanism due to the process - dependent contributions , which have a more rapid decrease with the growth of the transverse momentum of the produced meson . for the @xmath95 mesons",
    "these sub - leading terms can be reliably calculated in perturbative qcd . in the @xmath104 production ,",
    "higher orders in @xmath65 can be significant .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the sub - leading non - fragmentational contributions have the same feature as in the @xmath0 production : the yield in the photon hemisphere is enhanced and the one in the gluon hemisphere is suppressed due to the nonabelian interactions of gluons .",
    "one has to note that the quark - mass ratio determining the asymmetry value in the model under consideration is one and the same for the @xmath104 and @xmath0 mesons , and hence the effect of destructive interference can be experimentally observed at hera , where the energy scale is given by the ratio of @xmath105 , which is approximately equal to @xmath106 at the energy of lep and lhc combination .",
    "the distribution for the @xmath104-meson rapidity at the hera energy is shown in fig .",
