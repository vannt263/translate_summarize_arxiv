    "since the first demonstration of giga - bit - per - second ( gbps ) physical random bit generation ( rbg ) using semiconductor lasers by uchida et al . in 2008",
    "@xcite , chaotic lasers have attracted renewed interest as an entropy source for physical rbg . a semiconductor laser with delayed optical feedback can generate large - amplitude , chaotic intensity fluctuations in the ghz regime @xcite . a chaotic laser can be viewed as an `` amplifier '' of microscopic noises @xcite , which uses nonlinear dynamical instability as the amplification mechanism .",
    "although dynamical instability itself is deterministic , the non - deterministic randomness involved in microscopic noises results in unpredictable output behavior after the lyapunov time .",
    "the practical unpredictability of a chaotic laser is demonstrated experimentally in @xcite .    in the field of information and communication technology ( ict )",
    ", there is a great demand for physical ( truly ) random bit generators , because true randomness plays a crucial role as regards achieving secure communication and storage systems .",
    "a high generation rate for physical random bits is useful for applications based on information - theoretic security @xcite such as secret sharing @xcite and secure multi - party computation @xcite .",
    "these applications consume very many random numbers because their perfect security ( in terms of information theory ) is guaranteed by as much true randomness ( or full entropy ) as original information that one wants to encrypt .",
    "rbg using a chaotic laser has the potential to meet the need for high - generation - rate physical random bit generators .",
    "with rbg using a chaotic laser , an ad converter ( adc ) that resolves the state of the laser is as important as the entropy source .",
    "for example , digitization resolution of an adc is directly related to the rbg rate .",
    "many studies have demonstrated the enhancement of the rbg rate by multi - bit sampling @xcite , although in these cases bit manipulation is needed to reduce the biases of the generated bits .",
    "thus far , such bit manipulation has only been performed offline . moreover ,",
    "real - time ad conversion has only been examined in a few studies @xcite , and all of these studies used one - bit adcs .",
    "the high generation rate proves its worth when it is used in a real - time physical random bit streaming ( rbs ) system , which can both perform bit manipulation for bias reduction in real time and continuously supply random bits to the memory of a server or a personal computer ( pc ) . as a step towards application in the ict field , it is important to examine the feasibility of such a real - time streaming system by using currently available electronic devices .",
    "we addressed this new challenge by integrating a chaotic laser with a commercially available adc board that had a data interface with a pc , paying special attention to the end - to - end entropy source model , that is , how the entropy from physical sources is converted into bit entropy .",
    "we developed software for real - time bit manipulation for bias reduction and streaming to a pc user s memory space , and demonstrated a physical rbs rate of up to 4 gbps .",
    "we emphasize that this rate was measured in terms of the throughput of physical random bits supplied to a pc user s memory space , in contrast to previous theoretical estimates based on offline post processing .",
    "our rbs system allows us to easily store and access physical random bits in a pc .",
    "we used this advantage to carry out a comprehensive assessment of physical random bits .",
    "in particular , we evaluated the pass rate of the nist test suite for random number generators @xcite .",
    "for various parameter values of the bit manipulation algorithm , we found that the pass rates were from 65 % to 75 % , which are comparable to the pass rates previously evaluated for commonly - used reliable pseudorandom bit generators @xcite .",
    "a schematic diagram of our rbs system is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : setup](a ) .",
    "the physical entropy source is a monolithically integrated chaotic laser chip , whose structure is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) .",
    "it consists of a single frequency distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser emitting at a wavelength of 1550 nm , two semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soa@xmath0 and soa@xmath1 ) , and a passive waveguide one of whose edges is coated with high reflectivity film . the passive waveguide works as an external cavity for delayed optical feedback to the dfb laser , and the two soas are used to tune the strength and phase of the feedback .",
    "our chaotic laser chip is similar to those studied in @xcite , except that our chip has no integrated photodiode .",
    "the light output intensity of the chip exhibits large - amplitude , chaotic oscillations when the external cavity is sufficiently long and the feedback is sufficiently strong .",
    "we set the length of the external cavity at 1.03 cm to ensure that there were broadband chaotic oscillations in the ghz regime @xcite .",
    "the injection currents for the dfb laser ( denoted by @xmath2 ) and two soas ( denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , and the temperature of the chip were adjusted with a current - temperature controller ( ilx lightwave ldc-3900 ) . for the experiments reported in this paper , we fixed the injection currents at @xmath2 @xmath5 20.02 @xmath6 0.01 ma ( the lasing threshold was around 12 ma ) , @xmath3 @xmath5 3.08 @xmath6 0.01 ma , and @xmath4 @xmath5 2.45 @xmath6 0.01 ma .",
    "the temperature was fixed at 20.0 @xmath6 0.1 @xmath7c .",
    "the output from the chaotic laser chip was converted to an electronic signal with a high - speed ac - coupled photodetector ( new focus , 1544-b , 12 ghz bandwidth ) .",
    "we used an optical fiber isolator to avoid unwanted feedback to the laser as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) .",
    "the electronic signal from the photodetector was transferred to an adc board ( sp - devices , adq-412 - 4 g , 2-ghz analog bandwidth , 12-bit digitization resolution ) through a coaxial cable .",
    "the adc board can sample signals at a rate of up to 2 giga - samples - per - second ( gsps ) , and sampled data are transferred to a pc via a pci express ( gen2@xmath88 ) interface .",
    "figure [ fig : signal](a ) shows radio - frequency spectra with the chaotic laser turned on and turned off ( i.e. , noise level ) .",
    "the spectral data were acquired with software called adcapturelab ( sp - devices ) in the 2-ghz bandwidth mode and with full 12-bit resolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal](a ) , we can see that the intensity increased by 35 db compared with the noise level , and it exhibits a flat dependence on frequency as with white noise .",
    "we will show that these characteristics are suitable for the physical entropy source of rbg .",
    "the 12-bit range of the adc corresponds to a fixed peak - to - peak voltage of 800 mv .",
    "we customized the field - programmable - gate - array ( fpga ) on the adc board so that only 8-bit data were transferred to the pc , where any eight contiguous bits can be selected by setting an fpga parameter from the pc , and this defines the signal range of the adc . for the experimental data reported in this paper , we arranged it so that the eight bits from the lowest 4th to 11th bits were transferred to the pc ( namely , we discarded the most significant bit and the lowest three bits of the full twelve bits ) , so that the signal range of the adc board fitted the dynamic range of the input signal .",
    "moreover , by programming the fpga , we set the sampling rate of the adc at 1 gsps ( i.e. , 1-ns sampling interval ) .",
    "this is because the timescale needed for amplifying microscopic noises to a macro - scale has been measured to be around 1 ns for a similar chaotic laser chip @xcite .",
    "that is , the statistical distribution of intensity values after 1 ns converges close to the asymptotic distribution .",
    "in this way , the unpredictability of a sampled data sequence is guaranteed by the physical mechanism of the microscopic noise amplification by nonlinear dynamical instability @xcite . with the above settings for the fpga",
    ", the 8-bit data were transferred to the pc at 1 gsps , yielding a data transfer rate of 8 gbps .",
    "the data bandwidth of the pci express gen2 @xmath88 ( @xmath9 25.6 gbps ) is sufficient for this data transfer .",
    "we developed random bit server software for transferring sampled raw data to the memory of the pc , and converting them to random bits with reduced biases in real time .",
    "we developed the software on a pc ( 2 cpus , 8-core , 2.6 ghz , 20 m cache ) with a linux os ( ubuntu 14.04 ) , and for data acquisition , we used api commands for the adc board ( sp - devices , adqapi ) . figure [ fig : data_flow ] shows a diagram of the data flow managed by random bit server software .",
    "the adc board stores sampled raw data in the local memory , and those data are continuously copied to the buffer memory space of the pc at a data streaming rate of 8 gbps ( note that the sampling rate and digitization resolution of the adc were fixed at 1 gsps and 8 bits , respectively ) .",
    "figure [ fig : signal](b ) shows a time - series plot of sampled raw data for the chaotic laser s output ( acquired at 1 gsps ) .",
    "then , the software converts the raw data to random bits with the bit manipulation algorithm described in sect .",
    "[ sect : bit_manipulation ] , and stores the generated random bits in the shared memory space .",
    "these random bits are ready to use , in the sense that their bias is well reduced by the bit manipulation algorithm .",
    "the random bits are continuously supplied to the shared memory space . as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : bit_manipulation ] , we confirmed an average streaming throughput of up to 4 gbps .",
    "these constantly supplied random bits can be delivered to a client program on demand .",
    "( b ) , and @xmath10 samples were used . , width=566 ]    when constructing a physical rbs system , it is important to clarify the origin of the randomness , or entropy . this point is emphasized in nist sp800 - 90b @xcite , for example , which requires _ a description of how the noise source works and rationale about why the noise source provides acceptable entropy output_. the randomness and unpredictability of the chaotic laser outputs have been extensively studied through physical modeling and related numerical and real experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "electronic noise is always unavoidable when a chaotic laser is integrated with electronic components .",
    "thus , we first report the extent to which the electronic noise contributes as an additional physical entropy source .    figures [ fig : histogram](a ) and [ fig : histogram](b ) respectively show typical finite - time probability distributions for the intensity of the chaotic laser and for the electronic noise ( for the latter , the chaotic laser is turned off ) . from the probability distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](b ) together with direct observation of the corresponding time series , we found that the intensity largely remained at a value of @xmath11 , but sporadic fluctuation occured ( in a truly noise - free case , we would expect the intensity to remain only in a single quantization bin ) .",
    "we consider this fluctuation to be mainly caused by electronic noise intrinsic to the photodetector and the adc board .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram](b ) shows that the intensity probability distribution mainly spread over two bins ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](c ) , we show a semi - log plot of the probability distribution , where we find that the fluctuation has distribution tails that spread over six quantization bins ( this variation corresponds to @xmath13 @xmath5 2.58 bits ) .",
    "this means that the number of bits that are not affected by the electronic noise is estimated to be 5.42 .",
    "we need to keep this in mind when we use a chaotic laser s signals for rbg . for applications that do not allow use of an unknown physical entropy source ,",
    "we need to exclude those bits that are suspected of being affected by electronic noise .    in previous studies ,",
    "less attention has been paid to the treatment of the electronic noise , and they might have constituted an additional physical entropy source . as far as passing the statistical tests for randomness",
    "is concerned , no significant anomalies have been reported when some lowest bits are included in rbg . in sect .",

    ", width=302 ]    before discussing the biases of generated bits and bit manipulation for bias reduction , we first fix our notations .",
    "we denote the decimal expression of the 8-bit sampled data at time @xmath19 @xmath5 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 ) by @xmath24 @xmath22 @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath24 takes an integer value , and the sampling interval @xmath26 is fixed at @xmath26 @xmath5 1 ns . we denote the binary expression of @xmath27 by @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xmath22 @xmath30 @xmath31 , that is , @xmath32 , where @xmath14 @xmath33 and @xmath14 @xmath5 7 correspond to the lowest significant bit ( lsb ) and the most significant bit ( msb ) , respectively .",
    "we assume that for a given @xmath14 ( @xmath5 0,@xmath34,7 ) , @xmath29 is an independent identically distributed random variable ( as a function of @xmath21 ) .",
    "this assumption can be approximately satisfied when the input signal is strongly chaotic and the sampling interval @xmath26 is sufficiently large .    because the probability distribution of sampled data is far from uniform as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](a ) , we expect the probability of each @xmath35 ( here we suppress the sample number index @xmath21 ) taking the value @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) to be biased .",
    "we define the bias of the @xmath14-th bit as the deviation from 1/2 of the probability that @xmath35 takes the value 0 , i.e. , @xmath38 figure [ fig : bias ] ( filled circles ( @xmath15 ) ) shows the @xmath14-dependence of the biases . for this calculation",
    ", we used consecutive 1-gbit samples . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] , we can see that a bit of less significance has a smaller bias .",
    "such a tendency has been observed in previous studies @xcite , although the reason for this tendency has not been theoretically discussed . in the appendix",
    ", we provide a simple explanation for this tendency based on dynamical systems theory .",
    "various bit manipulation methods for reducing the bias have been examined in previous studies @xcite , which consist mainly of exclusive - or ( xor ) operation , bit order reversing , and use of a delayed signal .",
    "xor operation plays a key role in the bias reduction . as is well known , when the random variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 have biases @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , their xored value @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 @xmath39 @xmath45 @xmath40 has a reduced bias of @xmath46 .    in the work we report in this paper , we employed bit manipulation essentially similar to the ones used in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies , we perform the bit manipulation in real time . in our rbs system , the bit manipulation can be carried out either on the fpga of the adc board or on a pc .",
    "we adopted the latter , because it provides easier coding and more tuning flexibility , although the former is more efficient in terms of data transfer ( namely , fewer data are transferred through the pci express bus when bit extraction is performed at the fpga ) .",
    "recently , uchida et al . @xcite implemented a more complicated bit manipulation algorithm in an fpga and achieved real - time physical rbg at up to 21.1 gbps with adc sampling rate of 3.6 gsps and bit manipulation extracting 8-bits per sample .",
    "however , in this case , the theoretical peak rbg rate exceeds the actual rbg rate . in the system reported in this paper , we prioritize the full description of the end - to - end entropy source model describing how the entropy from physical sources is converted into bit entropy , so we limit the streaming rate to ensure continuous streaming .",
