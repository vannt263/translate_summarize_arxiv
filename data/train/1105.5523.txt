    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) containing weakly magnetised neutron stars ( ns ) are classified into z and atoll sources @xcite .",
    "the classification is based upon the different tracks these two types of sources trace in the colour - colour diagrams ( cd ) and their associated timing properties in the different spectral states . even though detailed timing and spectral differences between the two class of sources are not completely explained ,",
    "higher accretion rate is generally believed to characterise the z as compared to the atoll sources .",
    "atoll sources have lower luminosities (  0.001 - 0.5 @xmath4 ) than z sources and they have fragmented cd consisting of banana state ( bs ) and extreme island state ( eis ) .",
    "there is also a transitional state between these two states referred to as island state . in the bs",
    "the source luminosity is high and the observed energy spectrum is soft ( high / soft state ) . on the other hand in the eis",
    "the source luminosity is low and the observed energy spectrum is hard ( low / hard state ) .",
    "irrespective of the type of source , there are two different approaches to model their energy spectra , both consisting of a soft / thermal and a hard / comptonized component ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in one approach the accretion disk",
    "is considered to be emitting the soft thermal component while the boundary layer emits the hard comptonised component (  eastern model  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the other approach ,",
    "the boundary layer emits the soft thermal component and the inner hot accretion disk emits the hard comptonised component of the spectrum (  western model  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to distinguish between these two approaches good quality broadband spectral data is required",
    "beppo - sax broadband ( 0.1 - 200 kev ) observations show that eastern - like models are preferred for several ns - lmxb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ suzaku _ observations cover a broad energy range of 0.7 - 70 kev with good spectral resolution .",
    "this capability of _ suzaku _ allows to distinguish between several modelling approaches for ns - lmxbs : eastern - like , as in the case of the z - source lmc x-2 @xcite ; western - like , as in the case of the periodic burster xb1323 - 619 @xcite ; scattered - in dust emission plus direct ns and/or disk blackbody emission , as for the eclipsing lmxb saxj1745.6 - 2901 @xcite .",

    "in this work , we analyse _ suzaku _ and _ rxte _ observations of aql x-1 , to constrain the geometry of the source in both the low flux eis and high flux bs , and to report the discovery of a hard x - ray tail in the bs .",
    "in particular , a standard accretion disk with a hot comptonizing boundary layer whose input photons are from the disk is the preferred geometry for both states .",
    "the alternate model of a hot comptonizing inner disk and a blackbody emitting boundary layer gives significantly larger @xmath11 for all four _ suzaku _ observations including three nearly simultaneous _ rxte _ observations .",
    "moreover , for the eis observations , the radius of the blackbody emitting boundary layer turns out to be unphysically small , @xmath12 km .",
    "the presence of a broad iron line feature provides further support for the existence of a cold accretion disk in the source .",
    "the preferred geometry is the same as inferred from broad band study of many other ns - lmxbs @xcite and hence seems to be general .    for all observations ,",
    "the luminosity of the input photons to the comptonizing hot boundary layer is similar to that of the disk and hence it is possible that the main source of input photons is the disk itself .",
    "while it may also be possible that the source of soft photons could be the underlying blackbody emitting neutron star , statistically the data can not differentiate between these scenarios .",
    "our results confirm that the electron temperature of the comptonizing boundary layer in eis is higher as compared to same in the bs",
    ". also the inner radius of the accretion disk is higher during the bs observation .",
    "the spectral slope @xmath13 remains nearly constant , implying that the optical depth has increased in the high flux state . in the `` nthcomp '' model",
    ", the optical depth of the medium , for a spherical geometry can be estimated by @xcite @xmath14^{1/2 } - \\frac{1}{2 }    \\label{eq_tau}\\ ] ] the optical depth @xmath15 for the observations ei1 and ei2 and @xmath16 for the ei3 observation . in the bs @xmath17 .",
    "the difference in the electron temperature is the primary cause for the two states to have different locations in the colour - colour diagrams",
    ". a larger number of observations , sampling the source at different times of the outburst will provide more information regarding the complete temporal evolution of the source .    for the eiss , when the input photons are assumed to be from the disk ( table [ tab : eis - m1a ] ) , the luminosity of the disk is @xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "the luminosity of the boundary layer , which is the luminosity in the comptonised component minus the input luminosity @xmath20 , is @xmath21 ergs s@xmath19 . thus energy released in the boundary layer is about @xmath22 times larger than that of the disk .",
    "when the input photons are taken to be the underlying neutron star surface , boundary layer luminosity , @xmath23 ergs s@xmath19 is about a factor of four more than the disk luminosity @xmath24 ergs s@xmath19 . for the bs this ratio is @xmath25 when the input photons are disk photons and @xmath26 when they arise from the underlying star surface . theoretically ,",
    "the ratio of the energy output in the boundary layer to that of the disk can range from @xmath27-@xmath28 depending on the spin and equation of state of the neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a ratio of five would imply an extremely soft equation of state . however , the simple phenomenological models used here do not warrant one to make concrete statements but one can conclude that the boundary layer is more luminous than the disk , which is consistent with the expected energy release ratio .",
    "an interesting result is the detection of an hard x - ray power - law emission in the high flux state which is only @xmath29% of the total source luminsoity .",
    "such hard tails have been detected in z sources and only one atoll source gx 13 + 1 earlier @xcite .",
    "the origin of this emission is unknown and maybe due to some non - thermal emission in a jet @xcite .",
    "indeed , a weak radio emission has been detected in the high soft state of aql x-1 @xcite , which is also observed in other atoll sources @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the hard x - ray emission could be due to an hybrid non - thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or bulk motion comptonization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "multiple observations of the source may reveal whether the hard x - ray tail is variable and whether it is correlated with the radio emission .",
    "the work highlights the utility of broad band spectral analysis of lmxb .",
    "apart from other _ suzaku _ observations the upcoming indian satellite astrosat will be useful in such studies of lmxbs containing weakly magnetised neutron stars as it will provide good timing and spectral resolution .",
