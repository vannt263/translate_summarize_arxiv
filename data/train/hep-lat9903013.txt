    "the confining interaction of a pair of static sources in non abelian gauge theories is mediated by a thin flux tube , or string , joining the two sources . at large distance , the energy of the flux tube is proportional to its length , hence the static potential grows linearly .",
    "when matter in the fundamental representation is added to the system , one expects that this potential flattens at some distance @xmath4 , where the string breaks to form pairs of matter particles which screen the confining potential .",
    "the broken string state describes a bound state of a static color source ( the fixed end of the string ) and a dynamical matter field ( the free end of the string ) .",
    "a similar screening is expected even in pure yang- mills theory for adjoint sources , since in this case the adjoint string may terminate on dynamical gluons .    despite many efforts , these string breaking effects have proved elusive in standard analyses of large wilson loops , both in qcd with dynamical fermions @xcite and in pure yang - mills theory with adjoint sources in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite and in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .    on the contrary , clear signals of string breaking have been observed in studies where the basis of operators has been enlarged in order to find a better overlap to the true ground state , following a method originally advocated in ref",

    ", fundamental string breaking has been found in su(2 ) higgs model in 2 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 1 @xcite dimensions , and adjoint string breaking in 2 + 1 su(2 ) pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these analyses is twofold .",
    "on one hand the wilson loop appears to have in general very poor overlap on the broken string state , the only exception being observed up to now in the 2 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) gauge theory with two flavors of staggered fermions @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it turns out that the operators with a good overlap with the broken string state have as a common feature the presence of two disjoint source lines .",
    "this is not only true in the above mentioned cases at zero temperature , but it is also evident in the recent observation of string breaking at finite temperature qcd with dynamical fermions , where the static potential is extracted from the correlator of two disjoint polyakov loops @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will show that in the usual string description of confinement @xcite one can find a simple explanation of such a relationship between the overlap properties and the number of disjoint static sources .",
    "in particular we shall derive an asymptotic functional form of the unquenched finite temperature potential which is then successfully compared with the qcd data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a solvable prototype of string breaking @xcite suggests that the world sheet swept by the string in its time evolution can exist in two different phases , known as tearing and normal phases .",
    "the question of the existence of a finite overlap of the wilson operator with the broken string state can be reformulated ( see section [ topo ] ) as the problem of finding the phase of the string world sheet .",
    "indeed in the former phase the world sheet is torn by large holes corresponding to pair creation of charged matter , hence the wilson loop is expected to fulfil the perimeter law at large distances . on the contrary , in the normal phase the string breaking",
    "is balanced by the inverse process of string soldering , so that adding dynamical matter to the system yields simply a renormalization of the string tension .",
    "in particular the wilson loop behaves exactly like in the quenched model and no macroscopic string breaking is visible .",
    "however , a simple topological argument shows that the situation drastically changes when one considers , instead of the wilson loop , operators constructed out of _ disjoint _ static sources . besides the usual contribution to the confining potential",
    "there is a new term which is necessarily absent in the quenched case and which survives at large source separations .",
    "this term makes string breaking effects easily detected on the lattice .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows . in section [ string ]",
    "we review some known bosonic string formulae about the asymptotic infrared behaviour of gauge operators and derive the new term contributing to correlator of two polyakov loops in the unquenched case .",
    "since there are no recent studies on the string effects in the quenched approximation of qcd , we devote section [ quen ] to an analysis of the quenched data of ref .",
    "it turns out that the bosonic string accurately describes the lattice data for distances larger than @xmath0 fm . in section [ unqu ]",
    "the analysis is extended to the unquenched case where we check that string predictions on the temperature dependence of the potential are compatible with the lattice data of ref .",
    "finally in section [ conc ] we draw some concluding remarks .",
    "let us start by considering the standard wilson loop . in absence of charged dynamical fields",
    "this loop acts as a fixed boundary of the surface associated to the world sheet swept by the confining string .",
    "when matter fields are added , any number of holes of any size may appear on this surface , reflecting the pair creation of dynamical charged particles . if these are light , the holes behave like free boundaries .",
    "the total string contribution to the wilson operator is then the sum over all possible insertions of multiconnected boundaries of the world sheet .",
    "it can be written diagrammatically as a loop expansion ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "there are two quantities controlling the number and the size of these holes .",
    "one is the mass of the matter fields ( it is easier to create lighter particles ) .",
    "the other is the number of charge species . for a theory with @xmath5 flavors and @xmath6 colors",
    "there is a factor of @xmath7 for each hole . likewise in the adjoint string",
    "every hole is accompanied by a factor of @xmath8 .    for light particles and @xmath7 large enough",
    ", we expect that the string world sheet is dominated by configurations with a large number of relatively small holes compared with the size of the wilson loop .",
    "these holes do not influence the area law of the wilson loop and their effect can be absorbed into the renormalization of the string tension , according to a string mechanism originally proposed in ref .  @xcite . under the circumstances there is no way to observe the string breaking through the study of large wilson loops .",
    "this may explain why this phenomenon has been so elusive both for fundamental and adjoint string in any dimension .",

    "the observed extremely poor overlap of the wilson loop with the broken string state seems to suggest that it belongs to the normal phase , with a possible exception for the su(2 ) gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions with dynamical fermions @xcite . perhaps in this case the quarks are not light enough .    for the operators with more than one connected source line the loop expansion has a topologically different form .",
    "take for instance a pair of polyakov loops of a gauge theory with dynamical fermions at finite temperature . from the point of view of the effective string , they are the two fixed boundaries of a cylinder ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the loop expansion splits into two different series , because starting at two - loop level there are configurations in which the two fixed boundaries are not connected by the string world sheet .",
    "if the system is in the normal phase the sum over the loop insertions can be still absorbed into the renormalization of the string tension , but now the loop expansion is the sum of two different terms . that with only one connected world sheet has no overlap to the broken string state but decays exponentially with the distance between the fixed boundaries , thus only the term with two disjoint pieces survives , which of course is expected to have a large overlap to the broken string state .",

    "the fixed boundary is not necessarily closed because it may terminate on charged fields .",

    "the relevant observable is the correlator of polyakov loops .",

    "on the two loops .",
    "the partition function is therefore : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the _ zero temperature _ string tension at the same coupling , @xmath14 is the lattice extension in the time direction , that is the inverse temperature , and now @xmath33 .",

    "therefore the result of the fit of the finite temperature potential should be compared to the zero temperature string tension to confirm the string picture .",
    "3 .   the free string picture must break down at temperatures near the deconfinement point where string interactions are believed to become important ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "therefore we need to use lattice data at temperatures not too close to the critical one .",
    "4 .   the main effect of string interactions is to renormalize the value of the string tension @xmath32 while leaving the functional form eq .",

    "we can conclude that the free string model of string breaking eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) is compatible with lattice result for finite temperature qcd , and certainly reproduces at least the qualitative features of the phenomenon .",
    "more data at moderate temperatures are certainly needed to draw a definite conclusion about the correctness of the model .",
    "in this paper we conjectured that the world sheet swept by the confining string in presence of matter fields belongs to the _ normal _ phase , characterized by a large number of microscopic holes produced by the matter fields , whose net effect is just to renormalize the string tension .",
    "this must be contrasted with the _ tearing _ phase , in which large holes dominate and drive the string tension between static sources to zero .",
    "* string breaking can not be detected by studying the large distance behavior of wilson loops : even in presence of dynamical matter fields the wilson loop expectation value should behave at large distance like in the quenched case , that is according to eq .",
    "( [ wilson ] ) .",
    "* on the contrary , when one considers operators made of disjoint static sources a simple topological argument shows that even if the world sheet is in the normal phase string breaking can be easily detected .",
    "both of these are in agreement with most of the rather large body of lattice data on the subject that has been published recently  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the only exception is ( 2 + 1)-dimensional @xmath103 theory with two flavors of staggered fermions , where string breaking effects in the wilson loop have been observed  @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the mass of the quarks used in ref .",
    "@xcite is large enough to make the world sheet belong to the tearing phase .",
    "indeed , the very same theory does not show any sign of string breaking in the adjoint wilson loop  @xcite where the `` matter '' is massless by definition .",
    "based on this conjecture , we have proposed an effective string model of string breaking for the simplest example of an operator constructed out of disjoint sources : the correlator of polyakov loops in finite temperature qcd .",
    "while the predictions of this model appear to be compatible with the lattice data , more data would be needed for a conclusive assessment of its validity .",
    "one can envisage a number of numerical experiments to further check the above conjecture and the effective string model .",
    "perhaps the simplest could be the analysis of the polyakov correlator in the adjoint representation at finite temperature . in this case",
    "one can work directly in the pure yang mills model and test accurately eq .",
