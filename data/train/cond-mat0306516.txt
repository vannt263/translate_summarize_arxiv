    "complex systems  together with their dynamical behavior known as complexity  are thought to pervade much of the natural , informational , sociological , and economic world @xcite .",
    "a unique , all - encompassing definition of a complex system is lacking - worse still , such a definition would probably end up being too vague . instead , such complex systems are better thought of in terms of a list of common features which distinguish them from ` simple ' systems , and from systems which are just ` complicated ' as opposed to being complex .",
    "although a unique list of complex system properties does not exist , most people would agree that the following would typically appear : feedback and adaptation at the macroscopic and/or microscopic level , many ( but not too many ) interacting parts , non - stationarity , evolution , coupling with the environment , and observed dynamics which depend upon the particular realization of the system .",
    "in addition , complex systems have the ability to produce large macroscopic changes which appear spontaneously but have long - lasting consequences .",
    "such large changes might also be referred to as ` innovations ' , ` breakthroughs ' , ` gateway events ' or ` punctuated equilibria ' depending on the context @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the particular trajectory taken by a complex system can be thought of as exhibiting ` frozen accidents ' @xcite .",
    "understanding the functionality of complex systems is of paramount importance , from both practical and theoretical viewpoints .",
    "such functionality is currently being addressed through the study of ` collectives ' @xcite .",
    "the down - side of labelling such a wide range of systems as belonging to the same ` complex ' family , is that instead of saying something about everything , one may end up saying nothing very much about anything .",
    "indeed , one may end up with little more than the vague notion that ` ant colonies are like vehicular traffic , which is like financial markets , which are like fungal colonies etc . ' . on the other hand",
    ", it would be a mistake to focus too narrowly on a specific example of a complex system since the lessons learned may not be transferable - worse still , they may be misleading or plain wrong in the context of other complex systems .",
    "such is the daunting task facing researchers in complex systems : based on studies of a few very specific complex system models , how can one extract general theoretical principles which have wide applicability across a range of disciplines ? this explains why , to date , there are very few truly universal theoretical principles or ` laws ' to describe complex systems .    as pointed out by john casti on p. 213 of ref .",
    "@xcite , ` .... a decent mathematical formalism to describe and analyze the [ so - called ] el farol problem would go a long way toward the creation of a viable theory of complex , adaptive systems ' .",
    "the rationale behind this statement is that the el farol problem , which was originally proposed by brian arthur@xcite to demonstrate the essence of complexity in financial markets , incorporates the key features of a complex system in an everyday setting .",
    "very briefly , the el farol problem concerns the collective decision - making of a group of potential bar - goers , who repeatedly try to predict whether they should attend a potentially overcrowded bar on a given night each week .",
    "they have no information about the others predictions .",
    "indeed the only information available to each agent is global , comprising a string of outcomes ( ` overcrowded ' or ` undercrowded ' ) for a limited number of previous occasions .",
    "hence they end up having to predict the predictions of others .",
    "no ` typical ' agent exists , since all such typical agents would then make the same decision , hence rendering their common prediction scheme useless .",
    "this simple yet intriguing problem has inspired a huge amount of interest in the physics community over the past few years .",
    "reference @xcite , which was the first work on the full el farol problem in the physics community , identified a minimum in the volatility of attendance at the bar with increasing adaptivity of the agents . with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , the physics literature has instead focussed on a simplified binary form of the el farol problem as introduced by challet and zhang @xcite .",
    "this so - called minority game ( mg ) is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and ref . @xcite .",
    "the minority game concerns a population of @xmath1  heterogeneous agents with limited capabilities and information , who repeatedly compete to be in the minority group .",
    "the agents ( e.g. people , cells , data - packets ) are adaptive , but only have access to global information about the game s progress . in both the el farol problem and the minority game , the time - averaged fluctuations in the system s global output",
    "are of particular importance  for example , the time - averaged fluctuations in attendance can be used to assess the wastage of the underlying global resource ( i.e. bar seating ) .    despite its appeal ,",
    "the el farol problem ( and the minority game in particular ) is somewhat limited in its applicability to general complex systems , and hence arguably falls short of representing a true generic paradigm for complex systems .",
    "first , the reward structure is simultaneously too restrictive and specific .",
    "agents in the minority game , for example , can only win if they instantaneously choose the minority group at a particular timestep : yet this is not what investors in a financial market , for example , would call ` winning ' @xcite .",
    "second , agents only have access to global information . in the natural world , most if not all biological and social systems have at least some degree of underlying connectivity between the agents , allowing for local exchange of information or physical goods @xcite .",
    "in fact it is this interplay of network structure , agent heterogeneity , and the resulting functionality of the overall system , which is likely to be of prime interest across disciplines in the complex systems field .",
    "three enormous challenges therefore face any candidate complex systems theory : it must be able to explain the specific numerical results observed for the el farol problem and its variants ; it should also be able to account for the presence of an arbitrary underlying network ; yet it should be directly applicable to a much wider class of ` game ' with a variety of reward structures .",
    "only then will one have a hope of claiming some form of generic theory of complex systems . and only then will the design of multi - agent collectives to address both forward and inverse problems , become relatively straightforward .",
    "it might then be possible to achieve the holy grail of predicting _ a priori _ how to engineer agents reward structures , or which specific game rules to invoke , or what network communication scheme to introduce , in order to achieve some global objective . for a detailed discussion of these issues , we refer to the paper of kagan tumer and david wolpert @xcite at this workshop .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to take a step in this more general direction , by building on the success of the crowd - anticrowd theory in describing both the original el farol problem @xcite , and the minority game @xcite and its variants .",
    "in particular , we present a formal treatment of the collective behavior of a generic multi - agent population which is competing for a limited resource .",
    "the applicability of the crowd - anticrowd analysis is _ not _ limited to mg - like games , even though we focus on mg - like games in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the crowd - anticrowd approach in explaining the numerical results .",
    "we also show how the crowd - anticrowd theory can be extended to incorporate the presence of networks .",
    "the theory is built around the crowding ( i.e. correlations ) in strategy - space , rather than the precise rules of the game itself , and only makes fairly modest assumptions about a game s dynamical behavior . to the extent that a given complex system mimics a general competitive multi - agent game , it is likely that the crowd - anticrowd approach will therefore be applicable .",
    "this would be a welcome development , given the lack of general theoretical concepts in the field of complex systems as a whole .",
    "the challenge then moves to understanding how best to embed the present theory within the powerful coin framework developed by wolpert and tumer for collectives @xcite .",
    "we have tried to aim this paper at a multi - disciplinary audience within the general complex systems community .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii briefly discusses the background to the crowd - anticrowd framework .",
    "section iii provides a description of a wide class of complex systems which will be our focus : we call these b - a - r ( binary agent resource ) problems in recognition of the stimulus provided by arthur s el farol problem .",
    "the minority game is a special limiting case of such b - a - r problems .",
    "section iv develops the crowd - anticrowd formalism which describes a general b - a - r system s dynamics .",
    "section v considers the implementation of the crowd - anticrowd formalism , deriving analytic expressions for the global fluctuations in the system in various limiting cases .",
    "section vi applies these results to both the basic minority game and several generalizations , in the absence of a network .",
    "section vii then considers the intriguing case of b - a - r systems subject to an underlying network .",
    "in particular , it is shown analytically that such network structure may have important benefits at very low values of network connectivity , in terms of reduced wastage of global resources .",
    "the conclusion is given in section viii .",
    "the fundamental idea behind our crowd - based approach describing the dynamics of a complex multi - agent system , is to incorporate accurately the correlations in strategies followed by the agents .",
    "this methodology is well - known in the field of many - body theory in physics , particularly in condensed matter physics where composite ` super - particles ' are typically considered which incorporate all the strong correlations in the system .",
    "a well - known example is an exciton gas : each exciton contains one negatively - charged electron and one positively - charged hole . because of their opposite charges , these two particles move in opposite directions in a given electric field and attract each other strongly .",
    "however since this exciton super - particle is neutral overall , any two excitons will have a negligible interaction and hence the excitons move independently of each other .",
    "more generally , a given exciton ( or so - called ` excitonic complex ' ) may contain a ` crowd ' of @xmath2 electrons , together with a ` crowd ' of @xmath3 holes having opposite behavior . in an analogous way ,",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory in multi - agent games forms groups containing like - minded agents ( ` crowd ' ) and opposite - minded agents ( ` anticrowd ' ) .",
    "this is done in such a way that the strong strategy correlations are confined within each group , leaving weakly interacting crowd - anticrowd groups which then behave in an uncorrelated way with respect to each other .",
    "the first application@xcite of our crowd - based approach was to the full el farol problem .",
    "it yielded good quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations .",
    "however the analysis was complicated by the fact that the space of strategies in the el farol problem is difficult to quantify .",
    "this analysis becomes far easier if the system has an underlying binary structure , as we will see in sections iii and iv .",
    "however we note that the crowd - anticrowd analysis is not in principle limited to such binary systems .",
    "as indicated above , the crowd - anticrowd analysis breaks the @xmath1-agent population down into groups of agents , according to the correlations between these agents strategies .",
    "each group @xmath4 contains a crowd of agents using strategies which are positively - correlated , and a complementary anticrowd using strategies which are strongly negatively - correlated to the crowd .",
    "hence a given group @xmath4 might contain @xmath5 $ ] agents who are all using strategy @xmath6 and hence act as a crowd ( e.g. by attending the bar en masse in the el farol problem ) together with @xmath7 $ ] agents who are all using the opposite strategy @xmath8 and hence act as an anticrowd ( e.g. by staying away from the bar en masse ) .",
    "most importantly , the anticrowd @xmath9 $ ] will always take the _",
    "opposite _ decisions to the crowd @xmath10 $ ] _ regardless _ of the current circumstances in the game , since the strategies @xmath6 and @xmath8 imply the opposite action in all situations .",
    "note that this collective action may be entirely involuntary in the sense that typical games will be competitive , and there may be very limited ( if any ) communication between agents .",
    "since all the strong correlations have been accounted for within each group , these individual groups @xmath11 will then act in an uncorrelated way with respect to each other , and hence can be treated as @xmath12 uncorrelated stochastic processes .",
    "the global dynamics of the system is then given by the sum of the @xmath12 uncorrelated stochastic processes generated by the groups @xmath11 .",
    "regarding the special limiting case of the minority game ( mg ) , we note that there have been various alternative theories proposed to describe the mg s dynamics @xcite .",
    "although elegant and sophisticated , such theories have however not been able to reproduce the original numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite over the full range of parameter space .",
    "what is missing from such theories is an accurate description of the correlations between agents strategies : in essence , these correlations produce a highly - correlated form of decision noise which can not easily be averaged over or added in . by contrast",
    "these strong correlations take center - stage in the crowd - anticrowd theory , in a similar way to particle - particle correlations taking center - stage in many - body physics .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the generic form of the b - a - r ( binary agent resource ) system under consideration . at timestep @xmath13 , each agent",
    "( e.g. a bar customer , a commuter , or a market agent ) decides whether to enter a game where the choices are action @xmath14 ( e.g. attend the bar , take route a , or buy ) and action @xmath15 ( e.g. go home , take route b , or sell ) .",
    "we will denote the number of agents choosing @xmath15 as @xmath16 $ ] , and the number choosing @xmath14 as @xmath17 $ ] . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume here that all the agents participate in the game at each timestep , although this is not a necessary restriction .",
    "we can define an ` excess demand ' as @xmath18=n_{+1}[t]-n_{-1}[t ] \\ \\ . \\label{vol}\\ ] ] as suggested in figure 1 , the agents may have connections between them : these connections may be temporary or permanent , and their functionality may be conditional on some other features in the problem . the global information available to the agents is a common memory of the recent history , i.e. the most recent @xmath19 global outcomes .",
    "for example for @xmath20 , the possible forms are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 which we denote simply as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 . hence at each timestep , the recent history constitutes a particular bit - string of length @xmath19 . for general @xmath19",
    ", there will be @xmath29 possible history bit - strings .",
    "these history bit - strings can alternatively be represented in decimal form : @xmath30 where @xmath31  corresponds to @xmath25 , @xmath32  corresponds to 01 etc .",
    "a strategy consists of a predicted action , @xmath15 or @xmath14 , for each possible history bit - string .",
    "hence there are @xmath33 possible strategies . for @xmath20 for example , there are therefore @xmath34 possible strategies . in order to mimic the heterogeneity in the system , a typical game setup would have each agent randomly picking @xmath35 strategies at the outset of the game .",
    "in the minority game , these strategies are then fixed for all time ",
    "however a more general setup would allow the strategies held , and hence the heterogeneity in the population , to change with time .",
    "the agents then update the scores of their strategies after each timestep with @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) as the pay - off for predicting the action which won ( or lost ) .",
    "this binary representation of histories and strategies is due to challet and zhang @xcite .",
    "the rules of the game determine the subsequent game dynamics .",
    "the particular rules chosen will depend on the practical system under consideration .",
    "it is an open question as to how best to abstract an appropriate ` game ' from a real - world complex system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discuss multi - agent games which are relevant to financial markets . elsewhere we plan to discuss possible choices of game for the specific case of foraging fungal colonies @xcite .",
    "the foraging mechanism adopted within such networks might well be active in other biological systems , and may also prove relevant to social / economic networks .",
    "insight into network functionality may even prove useful in designing and controlling arrays of imperfect nanostructures , microchips , nano - bio components , and other ` systems on a chip ' @xcite .",
    "the following rules need to be specified in order to fully define the dynamics of a multi - agent game :    * how is the global outcome , and hence the winning action , to be decided at each timestep @xmath13 ? in a general game , the global outcome may be an arbitrary function of the values of @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 $ ] for any @xmath39 . consider the specific case of the el farol problem : we can define the action @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) to be attend ( stay away ) with @xmath40 $ ] representing the bar capacity . if @xmath17<l[t]$ ] , the bar will be undercrowded and hence can be assigned the global outcome @xmath41 .",
    "hence the winning action is @xmath14 ( i.e. attend ) . likewise if @xmath17>l[t]$ ] , the bar will be overcrowded and can be assigned the global outcome @xmath42 .",
    "the winning action is then @xmath15 ( i.e. stay away ) .",
    "however more generally , the global outcome and hence winning action may be any function of present or past system data .",
    "furthermore , the resource level @xmath40 $ ] may be endogenously produced ( e.g. a specific function of past values of @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 $ ] ) or exogenously produced ( e.g. determined by external environmental concerns ) .",
    "figure 1 denotes the global outcome ( and hence winning action ) algorithm as lying in the hands of a ficticious ` game - master ' , who aggregates the information in the game such as @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] , and then announces the global outcome .",
    "we note that in principle , the agents themselves do not actually need to know what game they are playing .",
    "instead they are just fed with the global outcome : each of their @xmath35 strategies are then rewarded / penalized according to whether the strategy predicted the winning / losing action .",
    "one typical setup has agents adding / deducting one virtual point from strategies that would have suggested the winning / losing action . *",
    "how do agents decide which strategy to use ? typically one might expect agents to play their highest scoring strategy , as in the original el farol problem and minority game .",
    "however agents may instead adopt a stochastic method for choosing which strategy to use at each timestep .",
    "there may even be ` dumb ' agents , who use their worst strategy at each timestep .",
    "of course , it is not obvious that such agents would then necessarily lose , i.e. whether such a method is actually dumb will depend on the decisions of the other agents . * what happens in a strategy tie - break",
    "suppose agents are programmed to always use their highest - scoring strategy .",
    "if an agent were then to hold two or more strategies that are tied for the position of highest - scoring strategy , then a rule must be invoked for breaking this tie .",
    "one example would be for the agent to toss a fair coin in order to decide which of his tied strategies to use at that turn of the game .",
    "alternatively , an agent may prefer to stick with the strategy which was higher on the previous timestep .",
    "* what are the rules governing the connections between agents ? in terms of structure , the connections may be hard - wired or temporary , random or ordered or partially ordered ( e.g. scale - free network or small - world network ) . in terms of functionality",
    ", there is also an endless set of possible choices of rules .",
    "for example , any two connected agents might compare the scores of their highest scoring strategies , and hence adopt the predicted action of whichever strategy is overall the highest - scoring .",
    "just as above , a tie - break rule will then have to be imposed for the case where two connected agents have equal - scoring highest strategies  for example a coin - toss might be invoked , or a ` selfish ' rule may be used whereby an agent sticks with his own strategy in the event of such a tie .",
    "the connections themselves may have directionality , e.g. perhaps agent @xmath43 can influence agent @xmath44 but not vice - versa . or maybe the connection ( e.g. between @xmath43 and @xmath45 ) is inactive unless a certain criterion is met .",
    "hence it may turn out that agent @xmath43 follows @xmath44 even though agent @xmath44 is actually following agent @xmath45 . * do agents have to play at each timestep ?",
    "for simplicity in the present paper , we will consider that this is the case .",
    "this rule is easily generalized by introducing a confidence level : if the agent does nt hold any strategies with sufficiently high success rate , then the agent does not participate at that timestep .",
    "this in turn implies that the number of agents participating at each timestep fluctuates .",
    "we do not pursue this generalization here , but note that its effect is to systematically prevent the playing of low - scoring strategies which are anticorrelated to the high - scoring strategies . for financial markets , for example ,",
    "this extra property of confidence - level is a crucial ingredient for building a realistic market model , since it leads to fluctuations in the ` volume ' of active agents @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the set - up in figure 1 does not make any assumptions about the actual game being played , nor how the winning decision is to be decided .",
    "instead , one hopes to obtain a fairly general description of the type of dynamics which are possible _ without _ having to specify the exact details of the game . on the other hand",
    ", situations can arise where the precise details of the strategy tie - break mechanism , for example , have a fundamental impact on the type of dynamics exhibited by the system and hence its overall performance in terms of achieving some particular goal .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit example of this , for the case of network - based multi - agent systems .",
    "figure 2 shows in more detail the @xmath20 example strategy space from figure 1 .",
    "a strategy is a set of instructions to describe what an agent should do in any given situation , i.e. given any particular history @xmath46 , the strategy then decides what action the agent should take .",
    "the strategy space is the set of strategies from which agents are allocated their strategies .",
    "if this strategy allocation is fixed randomly at the outset , then this acts as a source of quenched disorder .",
    "alternatively , the strategy allocation may be allowed to evolve in response to the system s dynamics . in the case that the initial strategy allocation is fixed , it is clear that the agents playing the game are limited , and hence may become ` frustrated ' , by this quenched disorder .",
    "the strategy space shown is known as the full strategy space fss , and contains all possible permutations of the actions @xmath15 and @xmath14 for each history . as such there are @xmath47 strategies in this space .",
    "the @xmath48 dimensional hypercube shows all @xmath47 strategies from the fss at its vertices .",
    "of course , there are many additional strategies that could be thought of , but which are nt present within the fss . for example , the simple strategies of persistence and anti - persistence are not present in the fss .",
    "the advantage however of using the fss is that the strategies form a complete set , and as such the fss displays no bias towards any particular action for a given history . to include any additional strategies like persistence and anti",
    "- persistence would mean opening up the strategy space , hence losing the simplicity of the b - a - r structure and returning to the complexity of arthur s original el farol problem @xcite .",
    "it can be observed from the fss , that one can choose a subset of strategies @xcite such that any pair within this subset has one of the following characteristics :    * anti - correlated , e.g. @xmath49 and @xmath50 , or @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for example , any two agents using the ( @xmath20 ) strategies @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , would take the opposite action irrespective of the sequence of previous outcomes and hence the history .",
    "hence one agent will always do the opposite of the other agent . for example , if one agent chooses @xmath14 at a given timestep , the other agent will choose @xmath15 .",
    "their net effect on the demand @xmath53 $ ] therefore cancels out at each timestep , regardless of the history .",
    "hence they will not contribute to fluctuations in @xmath53 $ ] . * uncorrelated , e.g. @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "for example , any two agents using the strategies @xmath49 and @xmath51 respectively , would take the opposite action for two of the four histories , while they would take the same action for the remaining two histories .",
    "if the @xmath20 histories occur equally often , the actions of the two agents will be uncorrelated on average .",
    "a convenient measure of the distance ( i.e. closeness ) of any two strategies is the hamming distance which is defined as the number of bits that need to be changed in going from one strategy to another .",
    "for example , the hamming distance between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is @xmath54 , while the hamming distance between @xmath49 and @xmath51 is just @xmath55 .",
    "although there are @xmath56  strategies in the @xmath57 strategy space , it can be seen that one can choose subsets such that any strategy - pair within this subset is either anti - correlated or uncorrelated .",
    "consider , for example , the two groups @xmath58 and @xmath59 any two strategies within @xmath60  are uncorrelated since they have a hamming distance of @xmath55 . likewise",
    "any two strategies within @xmath61  are uncorrelated since they have a relative hamming distance of @xmath55 .",
    "however , each strategy in @xmath60 has an anti - correlated strategy in @xmath61 : for example , @xmath49 is anti - correlated to @xmath50 , @xmath52 is anti - correlated to @xmath51 etc .",
    "this subset of strategies comprising @xmath60  and @xmath61 , forms a reduced strategy space ( rss ) @xcite . since it contains the essential correlations of the full strategy space ( fss ) , running a given game simulation within the rss is likely to reproduce the main features obtained using the fss @xcite .",
    "the rss has a smaller number of strategies @xmath62 than the fss which has @xmath63 . for @xmath20 , there are @xmath64 strategies in the rss compared to @xmath34 in the fss , whilst for @xmath65 there are @xmath66 strategies in the fss but only @xmath67  strategies in the rss .",
    "we note that the choice of the rss is not unique , i.e. within a given fss there are many possible choices for a rss .",
    "in particular , it is possible to create @xmath68 distinct reduced strategy spaces from the fss . in short",
    ", the rss provides a minimal set of strategies which ` span ' the fss and are hence representative of its full structure .",
    "the history @xmath46 of recent outcomes changes in time , i.e. it is a dynamical variable . the history dynamics can be represented on a directed graph ( a so - called digraph ) .",
    "the particular form of directed graph is called a de bruijn graph .",
    "figure 3 shows some examples of the de bruijn graph for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the probability that the outcome at time @xmath71 will be a @xmath42 ( or @xmath41 ) depends on the state at time @xmath13 .",
    "hence it will depend on the previous @xmath19 outcomes , i.e. it depends on the particular state of the history bit - string .",
    "the dependence on earlier timesteps means that the game is not markovian .",
    "however , modifying the game such that there is a finite time - horizon for scoring strategies , may then allow the resulting game to be viewed as a high - dimensional markov process ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of the minority game ) .      the dynamics for a particular run of the b - a - r system will depend upon the strategies that the agents hold , and the random process used to decide tie - breaks",
    "the particular dynamics which emerge also depend upon the initial score - vector of the strategies and the initial history used to seed the start of the game .",
    "if the initial strategy score - vector is not ` typical ' , then a bias can be introduced into the game which never disappears . in short ,",
    "the system never recovers from this bias .",
    "it will be assumed that no such initial bias exists . in practice",
    "this is achieved , for example , by setting all the initial scores to zero .",
    "the initial choice of history is not considered to be an important effect .",
    "it is assumed that any transient effects resulting from the particular history seed will have disappeared , i.e. the initial history seed does not introduce any long - term bias .",
    "the strategy allocation among agents can be described in terms of a tensor @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this tensor @xmath73 describes the distribution of strategies among the @xmath1 individual agents .",
    "if this strategy allocation is fixed from the beginning of the game , then it acts as a quenched disorder in the system .",
    "the rank of the tensor @xmath73  is given by the number of strategies @xmath35 that each agent holds .",
    "for example , for @xmath74 the element @xmath75 gives the number of agents assigned strategy @xmath76 , then strategy @xmath77 , and then strategy @xmath78 , in that order . hence @xmath79 where the value of @xmath80  represents the number of distinct strategies that exist within the strategy space chosen : @xmath81 in the fss , and @xmath82 in the rss .",
    "figure 4 shows an example distribution @xmath83 for @xmath84 agents in the case of @xmath20 and @xmath85 , in the reduced strategy space rss .",
    "we note that a single @xmath83 ` macrostate ' corresponds to many possible ` microstates ' describing the specific partitions of strategies among the agents .",
    "for example , consider an @xmath86 agent system with @xmath87 : the microstate @xmath88 in which agent @xmath42 has strategy @xmath6 while agent @xmath55 has strategy @xmath89 , belongs to the same macrostate @xmath83 as @xmath90 in which agent @xmath42 has strategy @xmath89 while agent @xmath55 has strategy @xmath6 .",
    "hence the present crowd - anticrowd theory retained at the level of a given @xmath83 , describes the set of all games which belong to that same @xmath83 macrostate .",
    "we also note that although @xmath83 is not symmetric , it can be made so since the agents will typically not distinguish between the order in which the two strategies are picked .",

    "in this section we will consider the application of the crowd - anticrowd theory in some limiting cases .",

    "consider any particular strategy which was labelled previously by @xmath136 and is now labelled by @xmath222 . unlike the case of the flat disorder matrix , it is _ not _ guaranteed that this strategy s anticorrelated partner will lie in position @xmath223 .",
    "all that can be said is that the strategy @xmath6 has changed label from @xmath224 while the anticorrelated strategy has changed label from @xmath225 and that in general @xmath226 .",

    "so what should the form of @xmath220 be ? in the limit of negligible matrix disorder at small @xmath19 ,",
    "as studied in the previous section , it will be a delta - function at @xmath240 since in this case the rankings in terms of popularity and virtual - points will once more be identical .",
    "hence we recover the results of the previous section .",
    "however , as the relative importance of disorder in @xmath92 increases , the delta - function form will no longer be appropriate .",
    "one approximate solution to this problem is to assume that the resulting disorder in the popularity ranking ( as compared to the original virtual - point ranking ) is so strong , that the probability that @xmath221 is anticorrelated to @xmath239 becomes _ independent _ of the label @xmath221 and is hence given by @xmath241 .",
    "hence the anticorrelated strategy to @xmath222 could lie _ anywhere _ in the strategy list @xmath242 . in this sense , this is the opposite limit to the delta - function case corresponding to the flat disorder matrix at small @xmath19 .",

    "the superscripts ` flat @xmath246 ' and ` delta @xmath246 ' used in the previous section , therefore can be seen to refer to the form of the probability function @xmath220 .",

    "this latter expressions gives an even better fit to the numerical results shown later in figure 7 ] .",
    "the general dynamics for a typical game are likely to be similar in character when played in both the fss and the rss @xcite .",
    "hence the rss - based crowd - anticrowd theory would generally be expected to provide a valid description for games played in the fss as well .",
    "in addition to straightforward numerical demonstration for the particular game of interest , there is a theoretical justification which goes as follows . for a game played in the fss",
    "there are @xmath259 distinct subsets of strategies .",
    "each subset can be considered as a separate rss .",
    "note that the strategies that belong to a given rss are optimally spread out across the corresponding fss hypercube .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the @xmath34 , @xmath20 strategies across the @xmath54 dimensional hypercube .",
    "the positions of the strategies belonging to the rss are such that no two strategies have a hamming separation less than @xmath260 .",
    "the same can be said for any other choice of rss . due to the nature of a rss , and",
    "given similar strings of past outcomes over which to score strategies , each strategy within the rss attains a score in an uncorrelated or anticorrelated manner to any other strategy in the subset .",
    "any other rss within the fss will score its strategies in a similar way , although slightly out of phase .",
    "for example for @xmath111 , the first rss to be considered could contain the strategy @xmath261 , and the second rss considered could contain the strategy @xmath262 .",
    "it is easy to see that on @xmath263 out of @xmath64 occasions these two strategies would score in the same way .",
    "hence it can be seen that these two strategies from two separate rss , will follow each other during a typical run of an unbiased game .",
    "this argument extends across all strategies in all of the @xmath259 distinct rss s within the fss .",
    "hence a game using the fss behaves as if there are @xmath264 clusters of strategies and so is similar to a game played in the rss .",
    "these clusters form the crowds and anticrowds of the theory , and this clustering allows the use of just one rss in the theory .",
    "in this section we show that the present crowd - anticrowd theory , even within its rss formulation , provides a quantitative theory for both the minority game and several variants .",
    "there is currently no other analytic theory which can match the quantitative agreement of the crowd - anticrowd theory over such a parameter range , and over such a range of game variants .",
    "this justifies our belief that the crowd - anticrowd theory is an important milestone in such multi - agent systems , and possibly even for complex systems in general .",
    "it is also pleasing from the point of view of physics methodology , since the basic underlying philosophy of accounting correctly for ` inter - particle ' correlations is already known to be successful in more conventional areas of many - body physics .",
    "this success in turn raises the intriguing possibility that conventional many - body physics might itself be open to re - interpretation in terms of an appropriate multi - particle ` game ' : we leave this for future work .",
    "figure 7 shows the standard deviation @xmath201 of the excess demand @xmath53 $ ] , obtained for the particular case of the minority game .",

    "<S> we discuss a crowd - based theory for describing the collective behavior in a generic multi - agent population which is competing for a limited resource . these systems  whose binary versions we refer to as b - a - r ( binary agent resource ) collectives  have a dynamical evolution which is determined by the aggregate action of the heterogeneous , adaptive agent population . accounting for the strong correlations between agents strategies , </S>",
    "<S> yields an accurate description of the system s dynamics in terms of a ` crowd - anticrowd ' theory . </S>",
    "<S> this theory can incorporate the effects of an underlying network within the population . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , its applicability is _ not _ just limited to the el farol problem and the minority game . </S>",
