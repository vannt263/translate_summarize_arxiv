    "dynamics on networks has generated in the past decades an intense research activity within the pde control community @xcite .",
    "in particular , stability and stabilization of transport and wave propagation on networks raise challenging questions on the relationships between the asymptotic - in - time behavior of solutions on the one hand and , on the other hand , the topology of the network , its interconnection and damping laws at the vertices , and the rational dependence of the transit times on the network edges @xcite . a case of special interest",
    "is when some coefficients of the system are time - dependent and switch arbitrarily within a given set @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address stability issues first for transport systems with time - dependent transmission conditions and then for wave propagation on networks with time - dependent damping terms .",
    "when the time - dependent coefficients switch arbitrarily in a given bounded set , we prove that the stability is robust with respect to variations of the lengths of the edges of the network preserving their rational dependence structure ( see corollary [ corosilktransport ] for transport and corollary [ corowaveequivlambdal ] for wave propagation ) .",
    "such robustness enables us to get the main result of the paper , namely a necessary and sufficient criterion for exponential stability of wave propagation on networks : exponential stability holds for a network if and only if it is a tree and the damping is bounded away from zero at all external vertices but at most one ( theorem [ theowavestabifftopo ] ) .",
    "we address these issues by formulating them within the framework of non - autonomous linear difference equations @xmath0 this standard approach relies on the dalembert decomposition and classical transformations of hyperbolic systems of pdes into delay differential - difference equations @xcite . here",
    ", stability is meant uniformly with respect to the matrix - valued function @xmath1 belonging to a given class @xmath2 .    in the autonomous case , equation has a long history and its stability is completely characterized using laplace transform techniques by the celebrated hale  silkowski criterion ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.2 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 , theorem 6.1 ) ) .",
    "the latter can be formulated as follows : if @xmath3 are rationally independent , then all solutions of @xmath4 tend exponentially to zero as @xmath5 tends to infinity if and only if @xmath6 , where @xmath7^n } \\rho\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j e^{i \\theta_j}\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath8 denotes the spectral radius .",
    "notice that the latter condition does not depend on @xmath3 .",
    "the hale  silkowski criterion actually says more , namely the striking fact that exponential stability for some @xmath3 rationally independent is equivalent to exponential stability for any choice of positive delays @xmath9 . this criterion can be used to evaluate the maximal lyapunov exponent associated with @xmath4 , i.e. , the infimum over the exponential bounds for the corresponding semigroup .",
    "a remarkable feature of the hale  silkowski criterion is that , contrarily to the maximal lyapunov exponent , it does not involve taking limits as time tends to infinity .",
    "an extension of these results has been obtained in @xcite for the case where @xmath3 are not assumed to be rationally independent .",
    "the non - autonomous case turns out to be more difficult since one does not have a general characterization of the exponential stability of not involving limits as time tends to infinity . to illustrate that , consider the simple case @xmath10 of a single delay and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a bounded set of @xmath13 matrices .",
    "then the stability of is equivalent to that of the discrete - time switched system @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and it is characterized by the joint spectral radius of @xmath12 ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) and references therein ) for which there is not yet a general characterization not involving limits as @xmath16 tends to infinity .",
    "up to our knowledge , the only results regarding the stability of non - autonomous difference equations were obtained in @xcite , where sufficient conditions for stability are deduced from perron  frobenius theorem .",
    "our approach is rather based on a trajectory analysis relying on a suitable representation for solutions of , which expresses the solution @xmath17 at time @xmath5 as a linear combination of the initial condition @xmath18 evaluated at finitely many points identified explicitly .",
    "the matrix coefficients , denoted by @xmath19 , are obtained in terms of the functions @xmath20 and take into account the rational dependence structure of @xmath3 ( proposition [ propsolexpliciteadpbis ] ) .",
    "this representation provides a correspondence between the asymptotic behavior of solutions of , uniformly with respect to the initial condition @xmath18 and @xmath21 , and that of the matrix coefficients @xmath19 uniformly with respect to @xmath21 ( theorem [ theop0equivp1 ] ) . in the case where @xmath11 for some bounded set @xmath12 of @xmath22-tuples of @xmath13 matrices , we extend the results of @xcite , replacing @xmath23 in the hale  silkowski criterion by a generalization @xmath24 of the joint spectral radius . as a consequence of our analysis , and despite the lack of a closed and delay - independent formula for @xmath24 analogous to , we are able to show that stability for some @xmath22-tuple @xmath25 is equivalent to stability for any choice of @xmath22-tuple @xmath26 having the same rational dependence structure as @xmath27 ( corollaries [ corosilkrho0 ] and [ corosilkrhohs ] ) .",
