    "in this paper we report on the serendipitous detection of a foreground edge - on galaxy seen in absorption against the x - ray core of a cooling flow galaxy cluster .",
    "the cluster , abell 2029 , is a nearby ( @xmath0 ) cluster which contains a central cd galaxy whose diffuse light extends up to 850 kpc @xcite .",
    "it has been ( re)classified by @xcite as richness class 4.4 .",
    "x - ray studies of the cluster show that it is a very relaxed system , and is one of the most luminous galaxy clusters [ @xmath13  ergs s@xmath14 .",
    "we have examined the archival @xmath9 image of the cluster to study the structure of the thermal intracluster medium ( icm ) in the core of the cluster and the interaction of the central radio source with the icm ( t.  e.  clarke et al .",
    ", in preparation , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "while analyzing the @xmath9 image , we discovered a linear absorption feature roughly 15 south of the cluster core .",
    "this feature is due to the galaxy uzc j151054.6 + 054313 ( hereafter uzc j151054 ) , which is a beautiful example of a late - type spiral galaxy seen ( nearly ) edge - on in the foreground of the dense cluster abell  2029 .",
    "it has a distinctive bulge component and a rather thin disk with a disk - to - bulge ratio of @xmath15 , consistent with the parameters of an sb / sc galaxy ( figure  [ fig : optic_xray]a ) .",
    "@xcite measured redshifts of 31 galaxies toward abell  2029 and found uzc j151054 to be in the foreground of the cluster , at a redshift of @xmath1 , while the cluster is at a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the linear feature is due to photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays in the disk of the spiral galaxy which is seen against the diffuse thermal intracluster medium . in   [ obs ] , we discuss the x - ray , optical , and radio observations and reductions for this galaxy .",
    "the optical and  details of the system are given in ",

    "we adopt a luminosity distance of 90 mpc for uzc  j151054 .",
    "we express the physical properties in terms of this distance , and scale quantities with @xmath8 .",
    "this distance is consistent with a pure hubble flow and wmap cosmology @xcite , which gives @xmath16=93.2 mpc .",
    "this is also in agreement with the tully - fisher distance of @xmath17 83 mpc ( see   [ hi_prop ] below ) . at a distance of 90 mpc , the scale is 0.44 kpc / arcsec .",
    "the central region of abell 2029 was observed with the @xmath9 x - ray observatory on 2000 april 12 for a total time of 19.8 ksec ( obsid 891 ) .",
    "the observations were centered on the back - illuminated acis - s3 chip .",
    "we present a detailed description of the data reductions in paper ii and only provide a brief summary here .",
    "the data were analyzed using ciao version 2.3 and caldb 2.18 .",
    "the events were filtered for energy ( 0.310 kev ) and grade ( asca 0,2,3,4 , and 6 ) .",
    "the background light - curve was determined from the s1 chip and showed no strong flares , and we removed only 128 seconds of data due to high background .",
    "the background for the observation was determined from the blank sky background files collected by m. markevitch . for the purposes of studying the absorption due to the foreground galaxy ,",
    "it is the soft x - ray background in the 0.31 kev band which is most important . the soft background , which is mainly galactic , varies by a factor of @xmath182 even at high galactic latitudes ( abell  2029 is at @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , it would be preferable to use an in - situ background from the observation .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath20 pspc image of abell 2029 @xcite shows that the thermal x - ray emission from the cluster covers the entire s3 chip , and even extends beyond the @xmath9 s1 chip ( the other backside - illuminated chip ) . as a result",
    ", it is difficult to determine an in - situ background from the observation . for this absorption study",
    ", it would also be useful to separate the background into particle and galactic foregrounds and cosmological x - ray background .",
    "although the correct background is thus uncertain by a factor of about two , the dominant `` background '' in these measurement is actually the diffuse cluster emission from abell 2029 , and the results presented here are affected by less than 10% by this uncertainty in the real background .",
    "the sense of the variation is that , if the background is higher than we have assumed ( the likely sense of the variation ) , we have underestimated the absorption by the spiral galaxy , albeit very slightly .    figure  [ fig : optic_xray]b , c shows gaussian smoothed ( @xmath21=1 ) images in the soft and hard x - ray bands of the region around the spiral galaxy uzc j151054 , both corrected for exposure and background .",

    ".      observations were obtained for us by jodie martin ( uva ) and john hibbard ( nrao ) in two 10 minute observations with the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the observations were made with the spectral processor using two orthogonal polarizations with bandwidths of 10  mhz with a frequency resolution of 9.8  khz .",

    "the spectral stability was quite adequate and we have only subtracted a linear baseline from the data . the calibration was referenced to 3c295 which was observed about 12  hours after the galaxy at about the same elevation .",
    "we adopt a value for the flux of 3c295 of 22.46  jy at our observing frequency ( 1391  mhz ) from the @xcite scale which leads to the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : hi ] . from the scatter of the data in the line free channels",

    "we shall use this distance to derive physical quantities below but express those values in units of @xmath8 where appropriate .",
    "we have used the prescription in @xcite to determine the inclination and find a most - likely value of @xmath38 , assuming an intrinsic aspect ratio of 10:1 for the disk .",
    "the lower limit is @xmath39 if we assume that the galaxy is thin .",

    "given the seeing differences we only determine the photometry for the center of the galaxy ( a @xmath42 box ) , the bulge , the disk , and the galaxy as a whole .",
    "to define the regions used for photometry we took an average of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 frames to make masks and used the same area for all bands in the photometry .",
    "the values are corrected for foreground extinction using the prescription of @xcite ; but are not corrected for internal extinction ( see below ) .",
    "the background was determined by first masking all sources visible in any of the four bands , then estimating the average and gradient due to the cd halo from the remaining pixels on either side of the nucleus both above and below the disk .",
    "we estimate the photometry to be accurate to @xmath43  mag given the difficulty to estimate the local `` background '' levels in the presence of faint cluster galaxies and the large envelope of the cd galaxy that dominates abell  2029 .",
    "similarly , we estimate the colors to be accurate to @xmath18 0.05  0.1 mag .    the @xmath44 colors are consistent with those of scd galaxies given by @xcite with the @xmath45-corrections interpolated linearly to @xmath46 .",
    "for example , the global color is @xmath47 when 0.82 ( 1.14 ) is the corresponding `` average '' color of an scd ( sbc ) galaxy .",
    "the @xmath48 color is a bit blue ( 0.34 ) where 0.53 is expected for a typical scd galaxy ( 0.77 for an sbc ) , and could be affected by a contribution from  as well .",
    "the @xmath49 color is even bluer ( 1.17 when 1.37 is expected for an scd galaxy and 1.76 for an sbc ) , which might be an indication of recent star formation .",
    "these colors are uncorrected for internal extinction which would , of course , make them even bluer .",
    "there is a long - standing debate on the optical depth of ( late ) spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the correction to a face - on orientation is usually parametrized in terms of the aspect ratio as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the correction to the i band magnitude , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the apparent semi - major and semi - minor axes of the galaxy , and @xmath54 is an empirical coefficient . because our galaxy is about 2 magnitudes dimmer than @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xcite leading to a correction of @xmath57 . for comparison , we have used the two relations offered by tully and collaborators @xcite to compute the same correction , which in our case lead to values of @xmath58 using the relation that depends on the absolute magnitude , and @xmath59 using the dependence on the velocity width .",
    "given the statistical character of these prescriptions , we find their agreement quite encouraging .",
    "adding a @xmath45-correction of @xmath60 magnitudes from @xcite leads to an @xmath5 band estimate of the luminosity of @xmath61  .",
    "the expected stellar mass - to - light ratio of uzc  j151054 is @xmath62 in solar units @xcite yielding an estimate of the total stellar mass of the galaxy of @xmath63 .",
    "we have opted to use the average of both of the @xcite methods to similarly estimate a correction to the @xmath2 band photometry , which yields a value of @xmath64 .",
    "this allows us to estimate an absolute magnitude of @xmath65 ( which includes a @xmath45-correction of @xmath66 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) corrected to face - on but not for any residual effects from scattering or internal extinction .",
    "our ( final ) estimate of the @xmath2 band luminosity of this galaxy is thus @xmath67  .",
    "the expected stellar mass - to - light ratio of uzc  j151054 is @xmath68 in solar units @xcite .",
    "thus , the total stellar mass of the galaxy is expected to be @xmath69 in good agreement with the estimate from the @xmath5 band photometry .",
    "[ [ hi_prop ] ]    the  spectrum shows an asymptotic velocity of @xmath70 .",
    "although the  emission often extends beyond the optical emission , we derive a lower limit to the total mass of the galaxy by estimating the mass internal to the optical radius of 12  @xmath8  kpc as @xmath71 .",
    "integration of the  spectra yield estimates of the total fluxes of @xmath72  jy  and @xmath73  jy  for polarizations one and two , respectively , where the errors are derived from the scatter of the line - free channels and do not include calibration errors . as seen in figure  [ fig : hi ] , the second polarization is corrupted by rfi , so that we shall ignore it henceforth ( although it does offer confirmation of the velocity extent of the ) . after our analysis was completed , we have received the spectrum from @xcite electronically .",
    "their measured total flux is @xmath74  jy  , which we have been told should be increased by perhaps 5% to account for pointing errors and should be accurate to about 15% ( m. haynes , private communication ) . given our short integration , we consider the agreement of the two derived total fluxes somewhat coincidental .    nevertheless , we are encouraged to derive an  mass from our spectrum and arrive at a value of @xmath75  which is accurate to @xmath18 10% .",
    "thus , the galaxy shares in the common `` dark matter '' problem with ratios of @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( in solar units ) .",
    "the total of the stellar and  mass is approximately @xmath78 , which is still about five times smaller than the total mass from the rotation velocity .",
    "thus , the dark matter mass of the galaxy is approximately @xmath79 , out to a radius of @xmath80  kpc .",
    "we have also used the `` baryonic tully - fisher '' relation derived by @xcite to estimate the distance to uzc  j151054 . given the uncertainty that recent star formation adds to the @xmath2 band determination of the stellar mass , we have used the stellar mass derived above from the @xmath5 band photometry ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "equation 2 of @xcite yields an estimate of the mass in stars and gas of @xmath82 . correcting the  mass for the he fraction yields a value of @xmath83 and a luminosity distance of @xmath84=83 mpc , in good agreement with the hubble flow distance given the uncertainties and the unknown peculiar velocity of uzc  j151054 . using a value of @xmath85 appropriate for an 8 gyr sc galaxy with approximately continuous star formation @xcite , instead of our adopted value of 1.7 ( corresponding to a 12 gyr sc galaxy ) would lead to @xmath84=87 mpc .",
    "examination of figure  [ fig : optic_xray ] shows that the x - ray absorption region is roughly the size of the optical disk of uzc  j151054 .",
    "comparison of the hard ( 1.07.0 kev ) and soft ( 0.31.0 kev ) x - ray images indicates that the absorption is more prominent in the soft x - ray band as expected for photoelectric absorption .",
    "the @xmath9 0.31.0 kev image contains 82 counts in the region of absorption , compared to 197 and 184 counts in the same size region above and below the absorption feature .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath86 detection of the foreground spiral galaxy absorption feature",
    ". a careful comparison of the position angle of the optical galaxy and the x - ray absorption feature shows that the x - ray absorption may be slightly tilted ( @xmath87 ) relative to the galaxy disk ( figure  [ fig : optic_xray ] ) .",
    "such a misalignment could be the result of a warp in the hi disk relative to the optical disk in uzc  j151054 .",
    "the extent of the absorption region was determined by taking cuts through the x - ray images .",
    "we used square regions of width 36 running roughly east to west ( pa=872 ) along the x - ray absorption feature and determined the counts in each region from the 0.31.0 kev @xmath9 image .",
    "the box height is approximately the size of the optical spiral disk and the width was set small enough to allow several boxes to be placed along the absorption feature with sufficient counts to determine the extent of the absorption region . in figure",
    "[ fig : counts ] we show a series of exposure and background corrected counts from 34 regions running east to west along the absorption feature .",
    "figure  [ fig : counts ] also shows the results from shifting the boxes up and down by one box height and determining the counts both above and below the absorption feature .    in figure",
    "[ fig : counts_perp ] we show a similar plot for a set of 31 regions of size 55  @xmath88 05 running north - south parallel to the disk . note that the psf of the @xmath9 acis - s3 detector at these positions and energies is mainly determined by the pixel size on the detector , and the 80% encircled energy radius is about 07 .",
    "thus , the absorption from the disk is resolved perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the limited number of counts in the absorption region preclude any detailed modeling of the spatial structure of the absorption .",
    "the full width of the absorption along the disk is about 56  ( 25 kpc ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines in figure  [ fig : counts ] show the approximate i - band optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "the width of the absorption feature agrees fairly well with the optical width of the galaxy . in some ways",
    ", this might be surprising , since many spiral galaxies have  disks which extend beyond their optical disks .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray absorption at these energies is mainly due to heavy elements ( primarily oxygen ) , and the abundances of heavy elements are likely to be low outside of the optical disk . in the vertical direction ,",
    "the width of the absorption disk is about 5  ( 2.2 kpc ) , after making a small correction for the psf of the @xmath9 acis - s3 .",
    "the size and strength of the x - ray absorption can also be characterized by the equivalent width , or the width of a region with complete absorption and the same reduction in flux as that of the spiral galaxy absorption feature . using the 0.31.0 kev data , we determine an equivalent width of @xmath18 34  ( 15 kpc ) along the disk , and @xmath18 3  ( 1.3 kpc ) perpendicular to it . these values are smaller than the full width of the feature because the absorption is not complete .    to analyze in more detail the absorption due to the spiral disk , we extracted spectra from the feature and a larger surrounding `` background '' area .",
    "the spectra were binned to a minimum of 25 cts / bin to provide good statistics .",
    "the region of the absorption feature and the surrounding thermal icm were fit in xspec with a wabs * zwabs * mekal model after applying a correction for the quantum efficiency degradation .",

    "the temperature and metallicity for the cluster emission were fixed at the value determined by the surrounding `` background '' region , but the excess absorption was allowed to vary .",

    "we note that the hydrogen mass determined from the x - ray absorption ( assuming a uniform absorber and solar abundances ) is about a factor of 5 smaller than the atomic hydrogen mass from the 21 cm observations",

    "our limit of @xmath101jy is consistent with the lack of significant emission in the ir ; the galaxy is barely detectable in the 2mass survey images @xcite .",
    "the detected x - ray absorption is smaller than that expected from the amount of neutral hydrogen detected in 21-cm emission from the disk of uzc  j151054 .",
    "this may indicate that the ism in uzc  j151054 is not uniformly distributed over the absorption region , or that the metallicity is low .",
    "the x - ray absorption measurements also provide an upper limit on any additional diffuse gas or dust in this galaxy .",
    "we note that x - ray absorption is relatively insensitive to the physical state of the diffuse material .",
    "any form of gas or dust at temperatures below @xmath102 k would produce absorption . at the columns of interest here ,",
    "most of the absorption is due to the k - shell electrons in oxygen .",
    "the measurements directly give the column density of oxygen , rather than hydrogen .",
    "thus , the limits of the mass of the absorbing material depend inversely on the abundance of oxygen relative to hydrogen .    the mass of the absorbing material we detect , @xmath103 , is much less than the total mass of the galaxy or the dark matter mass , @xmath104 .",
    "thus , our measurements limit the possibility that the dark matter is diffuse baryonic gas .",
    "if the dark matter is in the form of a roughly spherical halo , then our limits on the absorption outside the disk yield a limit on the mass of @xmath105 , which is about a factor of three smaller than the dark matter mass .",
    "if the dark matter is in the disk and is uniformly distributed , then the limit on its mass is certainly less than the total absorbing mass determined for the disk of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the dark matter can not be diffuse gas , unless it either has very low metal abundances or is very inhomogeneous in its distribution .    in recent years",
    ", there have been a number of suggestions that dark matter in galaxies is indeed baryonic , and is due to dense clouds of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gas might either be located in a thick disk @xcite or in a more spherical halo @xcite .",
    "however , in either model , the clouds of gas are rather small and dense , and have a small covering factor .",
