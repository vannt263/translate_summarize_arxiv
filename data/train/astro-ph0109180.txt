    "cir  x-1  is a highly unusual x - ray binary , whose nature has been a puzzle for many years . since the early 1970s , cir  x-1 has shown erratic x - ray properties : its light curve differed dramatically each time it was observed .",
    "nevertheless , there is a periodic modulation of 16.6  d @xcite , which is believed to be the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the compact star in cir x-1 is a neutron star , inferred from the type i x - ray bursts observed in a brief episode ( tennant , fabian & shafer 1986 ) .",
    "further support is provided by the z - source behaviour seen recently in x - ray timing data from the _ rossi xte _ satellite ( shirey , bradt & levine 1999 ) .",
    "the radio counterpart of cir x-1 is located @xmath2  from the centre of the supernova remnant g321.9@xmath30.3 , and is apparently connected to the remnant by a radio nebula @xcite .",
    "it shows flares at the same period as the x - ray modulation @xcite .",
    "cir x-1 has two arcminute - scale radio jets @xcite , and an arcsecond - scale asymmetric jet suggests the presence of relativistic outflow from the source @xcite .",
    "the close association of cir  x-1 with the supernova remnant suggests that the system may be a young ( @xmath4  y old ) runaway system from a supernova explosion @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,>,>,<,^ \" , ]      as was seen in previous observations ( paper  i ) , the h@xmath0  line shows multiple components .",
    "in particular , the spectrum taken on 1999 july 11 shows a clear double - peaked profile .",
    "such profiles are well known in the optical spectra of soft x - ray transients and cataclysmic variables , where they are usually taken to indicate the presence of an accretion disk @xcite . a natural interpretation for the double - peaked lines in our spectra",
    "would therefore be that there is an accretion disk present , although other possible interpretations are discussed below (   [ sec : detection - accretion - disk ] ) .",
    "this is the first time evidence of the accretion disk has been seen in the optical spectra of cir x-1 .",
    "we fit gaussian profiles to the h@xmath0 line , using the specfit package in iraf @xcite .",
    "after normalising each spectrum by a low - order polynomial fit to the continuum , we fit either two or three gaussians to the h@xmath0  line .",
    "the spectrum taken on 1999 july 11 clearly showed a double - peaked profile , in addition to the broad blue - shifted component , so we fit three gaussians to this spectrum .",
    "the reduced @xmath5  for @xmath6  degrees of freedom changes from @xmath7  for a two - gaussian fit to @xmath8  for three gaussians . the spectrum from 2000",
    "may 16 also required an extra narrow component to achieve a good fit ( @xmath9  for a two - gaussian fit , @xmath10 for three gaussians ) .",
    "the other spectra were fit with two gaussians .",
    "the details of the fits are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the data and the fits are shown in figure  [ fig : halpha - fits ] , with the spectra arranged in order of phase . despite the spectra",
    "having been taken over a span of more than a year , there appears to be a clear trend of line shape with orbital phase .",
    "the spectrum taken at phase 0 ( 2000 may 22 ) is the only completely symmetric profile . at small phases ,",
    "the line profile begins to show asymmetry in the line . sometime after phase 0.4",
    ", the line shows a second peak in addition to the broad component ( 2000 may 16 ) , which persists for the second half of the orbit ( 1999 july 11 ) .",
    "we have fit two narrow components to the line at phase 0 , although it is possible that the profile is flat - topped instead of intrinsically double - peaked .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this in section  [ sec : detection - accretion - disk ] .",
    "in paper  i we presented five archival spectra from the aat and one from hst ; we can re - examine these spectra for evidence of the same pattern in the line profiles .",
    "three spectra ( 1976 may , 1978 august and 1997 june ) were taken near apastron , at phases 0.54 , 0.52 and 0.51 ; none of them shows a double - peaked profile .",
    "the spectra taken in the first half of the orbit all show an asymmetry on the blue wing ; no spectra were taken during the second half of the orbit ( phases 0.60.9 ) , so we do not know whether the double - peaked line has been consistently present . the spectrum taken near periastron ( 1977 september , phase 0.95 )",
    "does not show a symmetric profile ; the line is still asymmetric on the blue wing .",
    "thus we can say very little about the persistence of the pattern we find in our spectra from 19992000 .",
    "the equivalent width  of the h@xmath0 line is shown in table  [ tab : fits ] and its evolution is plotted in figure  [ fig : eqw ] .",
    "the equivalent width dropped dramatically between 1999 ( mjd 5137051412 ) and 2000 ( mjd 5168051738 ) , from 80  to 25 , and the drop is independent of the phase of the observations .",
    "this drop coincides with a drop in the x - ray flux observed by _",
    "rxte _ , where the baseline flux between flares ( @xmath11  for the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on _ rxte _ ) began a slow decline around 2000 march ( mjd 51600 ) .",
    "this downward trend of the h@xmath0 equivalent width is consistent with the trend seen over the last 25 years ( paper i , table  2 ) , where the observations in 1976 may found @xmath12 , declining to @xmath13  in 1997 .",
    "rough flux - calibration of this data and the archival data shows that this change in the equivalent width is not due to an increase in the brightness of the continuum , and therefore must reflect a real and dramatic decrease in the brightness of the emission line .",
    "the spectra all show emission lines of he@xmath1i  @xmath14  and @xmath15 . in most cases ,",
    "these lines are quite faint ; the equivalent width of the he@xmath1i  lines also dropped dramatically between 1999 and 2000 .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of the lines by fitting gaussians in the same manner as for the h@xmath0  lines . for most of the spectra ,",
    "a single gaussian for each line was sufficient .",
    "for the 1999 july 11 lines , the he@xmath1i  lines were double peaked just like the h@xmath0 line . the 1999 august 20 line required two components for a satisfactory fit .",
    "the spectrum from 2000 may 16 clearly showed p cygni profiles in both the he@xmath1i  lines ( figure  [ fig : heilines ] ) .",
    "p  cygni profiles were recently discovered in x - ray spectra of cir  x-1  taken by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - valley distance of the profile in the optical spectra is 7.62 , or 340 .",
    "this is a much smaller velocity than that seen in the x - ray spectra ( 20003000 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : heiew ] shows the equivalent width of the he@xmath1i  lines as a function of phase . in order to remove the dramatic secular variation which occurred between 1999 and 2000 , we normalised the he@xmath1i  equivalent widths by the equivalent width of the h@xmath0  line ( table  [ tab : fits ] , column 3 ) .",
    "the results show a smooth variation with phase ; both transitions are of similar strength , except for the abrupt reversal in the phase 0 spectrum , when the @xmath167065 line becomes significantly weaker than the @xmath166678 line .",
    "the measured velocities of the emission line do not seem to conform to any sensible pattern .",
    "in particular , there is no discernible signature of orbital motion over most of the orbit .",
    "this implies that the site of the emission is changing throughout the orbit , and possibly over the one year spanning our observations  see section  [ sec : discussion ] for a discussion of the implications for a model for the system .",
    "however , we do see significant orbital motion in the data taken near periastron .",
    "we divided the data taken on 2000 may 22 into four equal segments of 7200  s duration and performed the same analysis on each segment .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peri - v ] .",
    "both components of the h@xmath0  line , as well as the he@xmath1i  @xmath166678 line ( not plotted ) , show an increase in velocity of 120  over six hours .",
    "this certainly implies that at this point in the orbit the emission line is tracking the orbital motion ; in a highly elliptical orbit , nearly all the velocity swing happens right near periastron @xcite .    with only four velocity points",
    ", we can not place any interesting constraints on the orbital parameters .",
    "two representative curves are plotted with the observed points ; it can be seen that there is essentially no constraint on the orbital inclination , though the eccentricity must be high to produce the observed sharp swing in velocity .",
    "it is important to note that the phases have been calculated using the ephemeris of stewart et al . .",
    "phase 0 refers to the onset of radio flares , and how this relates to the x - ray dips observed by _",
    "rxte _  is not clear .",
    "we have examined the quick - look results provided by the rxte / asm team to see if we can compare the observed times of the x - ray dips with the predicted times from the stewart et al .",
    "ephemeris . the periastron passage on 2000",
    "may 22 did not have good asm coverage ; both the preceding and the following x - ray dips appear to have occurred 0.40.5  d later than the phase 0 predicted by the stewart et al .",
    "ephemeris , corresponding to a shift of 0.0240.03 in phase .",
    "given that the ephemeris was based on radio flares , and that the x - ray light curve changes so dramatically , this agreement is reasonably good .",
    "in future work we hope to further investigate the exact relationship between the x - ray , radio and optical behaviour .",
    "in paper  i , we proposed a theoretical model for cir  x-1 .",
    "the binary is a low - mass neutron - star binary with an ultra - eccentric binary orbit ( @xmath17 , possibly as high as 0.9 ; tauris et al .",
    "1999 ) . during periastron passage ,",
    "the companion star ( which is a subgiant of about 35 ) overfills its roche - lobe , causing a transfer of mass at a super - eddington rate , which in turn drives a strong matter outflow .",
    "after periastron , mass transfer from the companion ceases , but accretion continues at a near - eddington rate as the neutron star captures the residual matter in its roche - lobe .",
    "an accretion disk gradually forms , which is initially non - keplerian and geometrically thick .",
    "this change between quasi - spherical and disk accretion causes the change between strong x - ray variability after phase 0 . between phases",
    "0.50.9 , the accretion disk becomes keplerian and there is steady accretion .",
    "the disk is then disrupted by tidal forces during the following periastron passage .",
    "based on the consistently high velocities seen in all the data up to that time , we suggested in paper  i that cir  x-1  might have a very high radial velocity .",
    "our new spectroscopic data do not show evidence of high line - of - sight velocities , though the argument about the velocity from the association with g321.9@xmath30.3 is still valid .",
    "our data and the archival data show a persistent broad component in the h@xmath0 line , indicating the presence of a high - velocity flow .",
    "one possibility for the line - formation region is the accretion flow close to the neutron star .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of cir x-1 reaches the eddington limit at the phases shortly after periastron .",
    "this implies a mass accretion rate @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron number density . @xmath22 parametrises the degree of spherical accretion , and its value is unity for spherical accretion .",
    "hence the ionisation parameter @xmath23 implying a temperature @xmath24k for the accreting matter ( see hatchett et al .",
    "the strong x - ray emission from the source would therefore completely ionise the accretion gas with inflowing velocity with @xmath25 , making it unlikely to emit h balmer lines .",
    "alternatively , the broad component of the h@xmath0  line could be emitted from the outflow matter .",
    "a characteristic of a radiatively driven outflow is that the outflowing matter is accelerated from a slow initial velocity and eventually reaches a terminal velocity .",
    "as there is a negative gradient from the observer to the outflow matter , the blue wing of the line suffers very strong self - absorption .",
    "the line would therefore show a p  cygni profile . since our optical data do not show the p  cygni profile typical of such a radiatively driven outflow ( with the exception of one set of spectra : see below )",
    ", the gradient of the line - of - sight velocity in the line formation region must be positive , i.e. the outflow is decelerating .",
    "if the broad component originates from a high - velocity outflow , the line formation region is in the decelerating zone , and the accelerating zone is behind the photosphere .",
    "such outflow might be caused by an ejection of high - velocity material during the violent mass transfer epoch at the periastron .",
    "on one occasion , we do see an absorption component in the blue wing of the he@xmath1i  lines , though not in the h@xmath0  line .",
    "we suggest that , instead of arising in a radiatively driven outflow , we are seeing absorption from the outflowing material far from the system , superimposed on emission lines from the accretion disk .",
    "the absorbing matter consists of material ejected from the system in previous episodes of violent mass transfer , and the absorption is occurring at some distance from the system , where the outflow has decelerated significantly from the 20003000  seen in the x - ray spectra .",
    "the absorption is seen only in spectra from 2000 may 16 , which is when the he@xmath1i  emission from the disk was weakest ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the absorption in the outflow is masked in the other spectra by the strength of the emission line , which is also why we do not see similar absorption in the h@xmath0  line .",
    "our detection of the double - peaked lines formed in an accretion disk is strong evidence for the eccentric binary model for cir  x-1 .",
    "the double - peaked lines were seen twice , in spectra taken almost a year apart , at phases 0.88 and 0.62 .",
    "spectra taken in the first half of the orbit all show an asymmetric h@xmath0  emission line , while the spectrum taken at periastron ( phase 0.98 ) shows a completely symmetric line .",
    "double - peaked lines are often found in cataclysmic variables ( e.g.  ip peg , see marsh 1988 ) , which are binaries with a white dwarf accreting material from a low - mass companion star , and in black - hole binaries during the high - soft state ( e.g.  gx339@xmath34 , see soria , wu & johnston 1999 ) or quiescence ( e.g.a0620@xmath300 , johnston , kulkarni & oke 1989 ) .",
    "they are also found in the accretion - disk corona sources ( e.g.  2a  1822@xmath3371 , mason et al .",
    "they are , however , rare amongst other x - ray binaries , and x - ray pulsars do not typically show double - peaked optical lines371 was recently shown @xcite to be an x - ray pulsar ! ] .",
    "it was shown @xcite that double - peaked lines can be formed in a temperature - inversion layer on an opaque accretion disk when the disk is irradiated by soft x - rays .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of cir x-1 is soft , dominated by a black - body component with an effective temperature @xmath26kev @xcite .",
    "thus the double - peaked lines observed in cir x-1 probably indicate the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "moreover , a significant part of the disk surface is not obscured from the central x - ray source so that the irradiatively induced temperature inversion can occur .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 1999 july ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha - fits ] , phase 0.88 ) observation , which was the first spectrum to show double - peaked lines , was taken in the cycle after an orbit during which cir  x-1  did not have a post - periastron x - ray flare ; only a handful of orbits observed by xte had not shown such a flare before then .",
    "it is possible that this has some bearing on the visibility of the optical lines from the accretion disk , for instance if the absence of an x - ray outburst means that matter which usually obscures the disk was more transparent than usual .",
    "alternatively , the accretion rates during this observational epoch were low enough to allow a mature keplerian disk to develop within an orbital cycle .",
    "the double - peaked lines seen in 2000 may ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha - fits ] , phase 0.62 ) did not occur after such an anomalous orbit .",
    "however , by that stage the x - ray flux observed by _ rxte _  had begun to drop ( see sec  [ sec : secular - variation ] , fig .  [",
    "fig : eqw ] ) , which might also imply that veiling material was thinner .",
    "it is possible that , instead of being an intrinsically double - peaked line , the profile observed on 2000 may 16 is actually flat - topped .",
    "such lines have seen in several black hole candidates , such as gx  339@xmath34 @xcite and gro  j1655@xmath340 @xcite , where they are interpreted as arising in a horizontal wind launched from a disk @xcite .",
    "possibly the line in cir  x-1  arises in a similar fashion ; however , this requires the emission site to change from a spherical outflow ( phases @xmath27 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha - fits ] ) to a horizontal wind ( phase 0.6 ) to a disk ( phase 0.88 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the line as a barely - resolved double peak has at least the virtue of being a simpler explanation .    assuming the double - peaked lines arise in an accretion disk ,",
    "then the separation reflects the velocity at the outer edge of the emission region of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the separation of the peaks was very different on the two occasions the double - peaked profile was observed ( 370  in 1999 july , 230  in 2000 may ) , which suggests that the accretion disk had a very different size . this could be due to the different phase of the observation , implying the disk is shrinking as periastron approaches .",
    "figure  [ fig : disksize ] shows a comparison between the observed peak separations and a model where the size of the disk is truncated by the size of the roche lobe in an eccentric orbit .",
    "this represents the largest possible size for the accretion disk , and hence a _ lower _ limit to the separation of the two peaks .",
    "the fact that the observed velocities are above this limit implies that either the disk has not reached the truncation radius , or that the emission region for h@xmath0  is not at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "the former would imply that , after the disk is disrupted at periastron , it has not had time to grow to the truncation radius before the roche lobe begins to contract again ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disksize ] ) , which would imply that the viscous timescale for the growth of the disk is longer than the dynamical timescale , which is 8  d for half an orbit .",
    "alternatively , the change in peak separation could be the result of a secular variation in the size of the emitting region ; or the temperature of the disk could be varying , so that the location of the h@xmath0  emission site is changing . in this case , the smaller peak separation implies a hotter disk , with the emission site having moved towards the outside of the disk .",
    "other explanations for the double - peaked profiles are possible which do not require the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "they could , for instance , arise in a bipolar jet , since a relativistic jet has been inferred from high - resolution radio maps of the source @xcite .",
    "however , in ss  433 , which has a jet with velocity @xmath28 , the separation of the components is hundreds of ngstroms @xcite , compared to the 58  seen in our spectra .",
    "such a small separation could only be produced by a relativistic jet if the jet was almost in the plane of the sky ( in which case the transverse doppler shift would cause both components to be redshifted ) .",
    "thus any jet would need to be non - relativistic to produce the observed lines .",
    "variable double - peaked lines have also been seen in infrared spectra of cyg  x-3 @xcite , where they were interpreted as arising in a disk - like wind outside the binary orbit .",
    "such a disk - wind requires a large angular momentum , which would be unlikely in a system like cir  x-1   with such a large orbital period .",
    "the double - peaks could arise from emission in different parts of the system ; however , we note that the standard sites for such localised emission , such as the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the disk , still require the presence of a disk in the system .    finally , it is possible that the central dip in the double - peaked profile is formed by absorption in front between us and the emitter , especially given the fact that we see absorption in the he@xmath1i  lines on a different occasion ( see   [ sec : he - i - lines ] ) .",
    "such lines are seen in symbiotic stars , such as ch  cygni , which shows two symmetric peaks separated by a deep central reversal @xcite ; in this object , the profile is assumed to arise in a self - absorbed wind .",
    "however , in the case of the profiles seen in cir  x-1 , the conditions for such absorption would be hard to produce .",
    "since the profile is symmetric , the absorbers would need to be at a very similar velocity to the emitters ; and since the central dip is broad and does not reach the continuum , the absorbers would need a wide velocity dispersion and only a small optical depth .",
    "the most probable interpretation of the profile is that it arises from the doppler motions in an accretion disk .",
    "the brightness of the emission lines has decreased dramatically over the past 25 years , from @xmath12  in 1976 to @xmath29  in 2000 .",
    "our interpretation is that the contribution of different emission sites to the emission lines has been shifting over the years .",
    "the contribution from the accretion disk is likely to have been essentially constant , since the temperature of the disk is limited by the accretion rate ( assumed to be at eddington ) and the size of the disk is limited by the size of the orbit .",
    "the contribution to the emission line from other regions  the outflow , the companion star  can change dramatically depending on the state of the system .",
    "it is possible that we have seen the disk for the first time precisely because the contributions from other sites in the orbit have lessened , so the h@xmath0  line is now dominated by emission from the accretion disk .",
