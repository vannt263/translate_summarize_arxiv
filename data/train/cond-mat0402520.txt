    "ordering and condensation transitions in one - dimensional systems far from thermal equilibrium have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "it has been repeatedly demonstrated that unlike systems in thermal equilibrium , driven one - dimensional systems whose dynamics does not obey detailed - balance can be ordered even when the dynamics is local and noisy .    by making a correspondence between phase separation in one - dimensional systems and condensation in urn models , two mechanisms which allow for phase separation in driven systems have been suggested .",
    "urn models are simple lattice models defined on a ring geometry , where each site can either be vacant or occupied by one or more particles .",
    "the first mechanism is described in terms of the zero range process ( zrp ) @xcite . in this",
    "model particles hop between nearest neighbor lattice sites with rates @xmath4 which depend only on the number of particles @xmath0 at the departure site .",
    "if the rates decay to zero in the large @xmath0 limit , or if the rates decay slowly enough to a finite value , a condensation transition takes place , whereby a single lattice site becomes macroscopically occupied as the density is increased beyond a critical value .",
    "it has been suggested that the coarse - grained dynamics in a broad class of one - dimensional driven models can be described by a zrp with rates which at large @xmath0 decay as @xmath5 @xcite . in this case phase separation",
    "takes place only if @xmath6 .",
    "a second mechanism is described in terms of the of the chipping model ( cm ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this model involves two processes : _ chipping _ , where a single particle hops to a nearest neighbor site at a constant rate @xmath7 ; and _ diffusion _ , where all particles in a site hop together to an adjacent site with rate @xmath2 .",
    "this model can be viewed as a zrp with constant hopping rate ( @xmath8 ) , extended to include diffusion processes as well .",
    "mean - field analysis of this model indicates that this model exhibits a condensation transition at a critical density .",
    "this result remains valid beyond the mean - field approximation as long as the chipping process is symmetric @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that if the chipping process is biased either to the left or to the right , no condensation transition takes place @xcite .",
    "recently it has been suggested that the coarse - grained dynamics of certain cellular - automata traffic models can be modeled by the asymmetric cm @xcite . within this picture ,",
    "the coarse - grained evolution of traffic models is described in terms of domain dynamics , which essentially involves asymmetric chipping and diffusion processes .",
    "it has thus been concluded that no phase separation transition should be expected in this class of models , and that jamming phenomena take place as a broad crossover process rather than via a sharp phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist models which may be related to traffic , in which the rate of chipping a particle from a domain is not constant , but rather depends on the domain size .",
    "such an example is the bus route model @xcite , where an approximate description assigns hopping rates to buses that decay as a function of the distance to the next bus ahead .",
    "it is thus of interest to combine the features of the chipping model and the zrp processes and consider urn modes which exhibit chipping and diffusion processes with occupation dependent chipping rates .    in this paper",
    "we consider in details a class of urn models which incorporate both diffusion and chipping processes with occupation ( @xmath0 ) dependent chipping rates of the form @xmath9 . in section 2",
    "we introduce the generalized zrp and analyze its behavior both within mean - field approximation and by numerical simulations . in section 3",
    "we consider a simple driven diffusive model , and show that its coarse grained dynamics is described by this generalized zrp .",
    "conclusions and summary are presented in section 4 .",
    "the generalized zero - range process is defined on a lattice of @xmath10 sites , with periodic boundary conditions , occupied by @xmath11 particles .",
    "the dynamics is defined through the rates by which two nearest neighbor sites containing @xmath0 and @xmath12 particles , respectively , exchange particles : @xmath13 where the rate @xmath4 depends on the number of particles in the departure site , @xmath14 thus the model is specified by three dynamical parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and by the average occupancy @xmath17 .",
    "the limit @xmath18 corresponds to a zrp with no diffusion ; the limit @xmath8 recovers the chipping model .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 controls the spatial bias , with @xmath19 being the symmetric case .",
    "we first analyze the model within mean - field approximation , where correlations between sites are neglected .",
    "let @xmath20 be the probability of a given site to be occupied by @xmath0 particles .",
    "the mean - field evolution equations for @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    to solve these equations in the steady state , where all time derivatives vanish ,",
    "let us define a generating function @xmath24 .",
    "multiplying the @xmath25th equation in   by @xmath26 and summing over @xmath22 one obtains @xmath27 it is assumed that at criticality @xmath20 has the asymptotic large @xmath0 behavior @xmath28 .",
    "one is interested in evaluating @xmath29 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath30 . for the model to exhibit a condensation transition one needs @xmath31 . within the mean - field approximation the model exhibits condensation transition already at @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore expect such transition to take place for any @xmath32 ( an assertion which has been checked numerically ) , and hence assume in the following that @xmath31 .",
    "this form of @xmath20 implies that @xmath33 is well - defined for @xmath34 , and is singular at @xmath35 .",
    "taking @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , we find that for non - integer @xmath29 the singular part of @xmath33 has the following behavior for @xmath38 , @xmath39 where for the purpose of extracting the leading singularity we replace the sum by an integral . for integer",
    "@xmath29 the singularity of @xmath33 is of the form @xmath40 . in the following analysis",
    "we assume for convenience that @xmath29 is non - integer .",
    "the results derived in this analysis apply to the integer @xmath29 case as well .",
    "we thus make the anzats @xmath41 where the terms in the first brackets represent the regular part of @xmath33 , while the terms in the second brackets correspond to the singular part , with @xmath29 being its leading power .",
    "clearly non - leading singularities with powers @xmath42 can exist in this expansion as well . in the following",
    "we proceed by inserting this anzats into , and systematically solving this equation order by order in @xmath43 . from the equations for terms of order @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath29 one readily derives expressions for both the critical occupancy @xmath45 and @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 : @xmath48 note that non - leading singular terms can not contribute to terms of these orders , and they thus need not be considered .    in order to determine @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath29 one needs to distinguish between two cases :    ( _ i _ ): :    @xmath49  one proceeds by considering the orders    @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms in . since    @xmath52 ,",
    "non - leading singularities do not contribute to    these terms as well .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields    @xmath53    @xmath54^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] where    @xmath55 . inserting    into one",
    "gets the critical occupancy @xmath45 in terms of    the model parameters .",
    "this solution holds for values of    @xmath30 larger than @xmath56 , defined by    @xmath57 .",
    "note that in the limit    @xmath58 one has @xmath59 .",
    "this is    a result of the fact that at large values of @xmath30 diffusion    becomes rare and the zrp result is approached .",
    "( _ ii _ ): :    @xmath60  in this interval we find that for    @xmath61 ( for which @xmath62 )    @xmath29 becomes independent of @xmath30 , with    @xmath63 .",
    "to analyze this case we consider the    @xmath64 term in .",
    "this term is given by    @xmath65 , which does not vanish    since by definition @xmath66 .",
    "in this    @xmath29 interval non - leading singular terms in    @xmath33 can not contribute to this term . to see this ,",
    "let    @xmath67 correspond to a such sub - leading    term .",
    "its leading contribution to   is of the order    @xmath68 , which is of higher order than    @xmath69 .",
    "this analysis implies that    @xmath70 has to be an integer . within this    @xmath29 interval , the only possibility is    @xmath71 .",
    "+    the parameter @xmath47 , and thus the critical occupancy ,    can not be determined perturbatively in this @xmath29    interval .",
    "it is determined by the two boundary conditions imposed on ,    namely @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,    with @xmath46 given by . integrating [ eq : zrpcm_gs ]    numerically",
    ", one identifies the value of @xmath47 which    satisfies the boundary conditions .    in summary",
    ", we find that within the mean - field approximation @xmath63 for @xmath74 , while @xmath29 is a continuous function of @xmath30 for @xmath75 .",
    "the exponent @xmath29 exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath76 ( see figure  [ fig : zrpcm_mf_tau ] ) .",
    "the critical occupancy @xmath45 is given as a function of @xmath30 in figure  [ fig : zrpcm_mf_phic ] .",
    "for @xmath75 the curve is deduced from and , while for @xmath74 it is obtained numerically by finding the value of @xmath47 for which the solution of satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "one observes that although the exponent @xmath29 exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath56 , the critical occupancy is a continuous monotonically decreasing function of @xmath30 .",
    "note that increasing either @xmath2 or @xmath30 results in decreasing the critical occupancy .",
    "this is due to the fact that condensation is favored by both the diffusion process and by the size - dependency of the chipping .",
    "the value of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath2 is depicted in the inset of this figure .",
    "the @xmath77 curve found above corresponds to the mean - field approximation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is of interest to examine how this behavior is manifested in finite systems .",
    "this could give a useful insight for the model with nearest - neighbor exchange , where no analytic results are available , and where one has to resort only to numerical simulations of finite systems . to this end",
    "we carried out numerical simulations of the model , with a modified dynamics for which the mean - field equations yield the correct steady state .",
    "this modified dynamics is defined by the same rates as those of the original model , except that the two sites exchanging particles in each dynamical move are chosen at random , and are not necessarily nearest neighbors .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath29 from a simulation of a system of size @xmath78 are presented in figure  [ fig : zrpcm_mf_tau ] .",
    "it is observed that the qualitative behavior derived in the previous section is recovered .",
    "namely , @xmath29 assumes the value @xmath79 for small @xmath30 , while it continuously varies with @xmath30 at large @xmath30 . in the vicinity of the critical parameter @xmath56 ,",
    "large crossover effects dominate the dynamics , and the numerical curve seems to deviate from the analytical one .",
    "this is a finite size effect , and one needs far larger systems in order to recover the true asymptotic exponent @xmath29 in this region , as given by the exact solution found above .",
    "we carried out similar calculations for larger systems and found that indeed the trend is to move towards the analytical curve .      in the case of nearest - neighbor exchange no analytical solution for the steady - state distribution function is available , and one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "the exponent @xmath77 for the totally asymmetric case ( @xmath80 ) , as extracted from studies of systems of size @xmath78 , is given in figure  [ fig : zrpcm_oned_tau ] .",
    "it is readily seen that the numerical results are consistent with @xmath81 at small @xmath30 and with a continuously varying @xmath29 at large @xmath30 .",
    "this indicates that as in the cm ( @xmath8 ) the generalized model does not exhibit a condensation transition for small @xmath82 .",
    "condensation is obtained only above a certain threshold of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the precise nature of the curve in hard to determine numerically , due to the finite size effects which dominate the dynamics in the vicinity of @xmath56 , as for the mean - field dynamics .",
    "thus , for example , accurate determination of @xmath56 is not possible , although it seems close , or equal , to @xmath83 .",
    "it is also not clear from the simulations whether or not @xmath77 is discontinues at @xmath56 .",
    "we also carried out numerical studies of the symmetric case , @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath8 it is known that @xmath63 , as in mean - field @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath29 remains locked at @xmath79 for sufficiently small @xmath30 , while @xmath29 varies continuously above this value for large @xmath30 .",
    "we now demonstrate that the generalized zero - range process considered in the previous section could be relevant to the coarse - grained dynamics of certain driven - diffusive models . to this end",
    "we introduce a simple driven - diffusive model , and analyze it using the generalized zrp model discussed above .",
    "this model is related to a class of models whose coarse - grained dynamics has been described in terms of the zrp @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those models , the model presented here exhibits also domain diffusion .",
    "the model evolves in discrete time ( namely through a parallel update scheme ) , and is therefore related to cellular automata models introduced to study traffic flow @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on a lattice of @xmath85 sites .",
    "each site can either be vacant ( @xmath86 ) , or occupied by positive ( @xmath87 ) or negative ( @xmath88 ) particle .",
    "the dynamical moves are carried out in parallel by two consecutive update steps .",
    "step 1 : @xmath89    step 2 : @xmath90    here @xmath91 is a particle of either type and @xmath92 .",
    "the model allows for single and double site jumps , and it exhibits features which do not exist in models with only single - site jumps . note that while all transition probabilities in step 2 are symmetric under particle - type exchange and left - right reflection , this symmetry is broken by the transitions of step 1 . at high density the system has states in which all vacancies are isolated , and are thus deterministic . in this case ergodicity is broken .",
    "consider now the coarse - grained dynamics of this model .",
    "let us define a domain in this model as a sequence of particles , interrupted only by isolated vacancies .",
    "these vacancies move deterministically to the left .",
    "the evolution of a domain can be described in terms of two processes : ( a ) a chipping process , in which a positive ( negative ) particle leaves a domain of size @xmath0 to the right ( left ) with rate @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) ; and ( b ) a diffusion process , in which a vacancy penetrates the domain from its right ( with probability @xmath95 ) and advances deterministically to its left , thus shifting its center of mass one unit to the right . in figure",
    "[ fig : config ] a space - time configuration of the model is given .",
    "one readily observes the evolution of domains through chipping and diffusion , and the coalescence of domains upon contact .",
    "we now consider the current which flows through a domain .",
    "the size @xmath0 of a domain is defined as the number of particles it contains , ignoring the vacancies in it .",
    "since vacancies move deterministically through a domain , one may project the vacancies out of the domain dynamics , and consider only the dynamics of the charges .",
    "this dynamics is in fact described by the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite .",
    "typically , a domain is asymmetric , composed of an unequal @xmath87 and @xmath88 charge densities . in its maximal current state ,",
    "obtained for large @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the current through such a domain takes the form @xmath97 with @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath99 , with @xmath100 some constants , and @xmath98 .",
    "the coarse - grained domain dynamics of this model is thus related to the generalized zrp picture of section [ sec : zrpcm ] , with @xmath101 and @xmath98 . since our numerical data ( figure  [ fig : zrpcm_oned_tau ] ) suggests that @xmath102 , we expect the domain size distribution @xmath20 to take the form @xmath103 , with @xmath81 . within the domain length accessible in numerical studies",
    "one could not get an accurate estimate for the exponent @xmath29 .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the model indicate that @xmath29 is larger than its zero - diffusion limit ( @xmath104 ) , and is close or equal to @xmath83 .",
    "note that the correspondence between this model and the zero - range process can only be made in the region of the model parameters where the domains are in the maximal - current state , and where the absorbing states are not reached .    before concluding let us note that nearest - neighbor attractive interaction between particle of the same species could result in larger values of @xmath30 , possibly reaching @xmath105 . in this case",
    "the dynamics within a domain becomes identical to that of the kls model @xcite .",
    "here @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the strength of the interaction @xcite . for large values of",
    "@xmath107 one expects the exponent @xmath29 to increase beyond @xmath108 .",
    "this should be accompanied by a phase separation at high densities .",
    "in this work we generalize a class of zero - range processes with hopping rates of the form @xmath109 to include diffusion .",
    "in particular the exponent @xmath29 associated with the occupation distribution @xmath110 , and its dependence on the parameter @xmath30 , is studied . both mean - field approximation and numerical analysis show that for sufficiently small @xmath30 the exponent @xmath29 is @xmath30 independent , and assumes its @xmath8 value . in particular , in the mean - field approximation @xmath63",
    "while for asymmetric nearest - neighbor chipping numerical simulations indicate that @xmath108 . above a critical value of @xmath30",
    "the exponent @xmath29 becomes a continuously increasing function of @xmath30 .",
    "this model could be relevant for describing the coarse - grained dynamics of certain driven diffusive models , and possibly traffic models .",
    "a particular example of a driven diffusive system for which this is the case is presented .",
    "the fact that @xmath108 in the asymmetric chipping - model has been interpreted as an indication that jamming in traffic models do not take place via a sharp phase transition @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper indicates that this result is rather robust , and could hold even for a more general class of traffic models , for which the chipping - like process exhibits a weak dependence on the length of the domain ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "such dependence may be of relevance for traffic models which allow overtaking .",
