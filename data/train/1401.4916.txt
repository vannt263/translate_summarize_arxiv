    "highly - reflective ( hr ) dielectric mirror coatings are essential for interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( gwds ) .",
    "optical coatings with low optical absorption and low mechanical loss are required  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that mechanical loss in optical coatings will result in a significant thermal noise source in gwds of the 2nd generation , which are currently under construction  @xcite .",
    "the 2nd generation of gwds will operate at the well - established laser wavelength of and will use well - established dielectric optical coatings made of alternating layers of silica ( sio@xmath0 ) and tantala ( ta@xmath0o@xmath7 ) .",
    "the test mass mirror hr coatings for the 1st generation ligo gwds  @xcite had a design transmission of  @xcite and an absorption requirement of @xmath8{ppm}$ ] .",
    "for the 2nd generation advanced ligo gwds the optical absorption needs to be less than  @xcite .",
    "while coatings with the specified absorption requirement were already produced  @xcite , the mechanical loss realized is still above the requirement of @xmath9  @xcite , at which tantala contributes most to the coating s mechanical loss  @xcite .",
    "doping the tantala with titanium reduces the loss by nearly a factor of two , but slightly increases the coating absorption  @xcite .",
    "in addition , titanium doped tantala shows a loss peak at low temperatures  @xcite , where some of the 3rd generation gwds will operate  @xcite .",
    "therefore various materials are under investigation to replace tantala within dielectric coatings  @xcite .",
    "because of its high mechanical q - factor at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite , crystalline silicon ( c - si ) is considered as a test - mass material  @xcite for future gwds .",
    "c - si shows a high optical absorption at .",
    "since the absorption decreases rapidly toward higher wavelengths  @xcite , the use of c - si test masses is planned at a wavelength of , which corresponds to a photon energy below the silicon band gap .",
    "silicon might also be an interesting candidate for a coating material in view of replacing tantala .",
    "the high index of refraction of si of @xmath10 at  @xcite significantly reduces the number of single layers required to achieve high reflectivities .",
    "it also reduces the geometrical thickness of the coating stack , since a single layer has a constant optical thickness of about a quarter of the wavelength .",
    "the optical as well as the mechanical loss of the si films , however , need to be less than the values for tantala .",
    "dielectric coating stacks usually contain amorphous material , and amorphous si ( a - si ) is known to be rather absorptive at  @xcite . in  @xcite it",
    "is reported that annealing of a - si reduces the absorption coefficient of the material .",
