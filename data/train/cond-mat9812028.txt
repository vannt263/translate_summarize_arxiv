    "it is widely accepted that one of the important ingredients for the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite and various complex phenomena observed in perovskite manganites is the orbital degree of freedom in @xmath0 ion .",

    ", the slightly larger intensity is shown in the @xmath81-polarized case in comparison with that in the @xmath123-polarized one and it is interpreted as follows . in the present orbital order ,",
    "a dominant excitation process around @xmath241-point is that in fig .",
    "5(b ) , where the orbital states in @xmath32 and @xmath34 sites are @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively .",
    "since the orbital at the @xmath32-site , that is , @xmath244 , shrinks in @xmath81-direction , the @xmath245 excitation shows a larger intensity than that of @xmath246 excitation due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , the intensity is slightly larger in the @xmath81-polarized case . in fig .",
    "10 , the results in the spin - a case with the @xmath81-polarization are presented .",
    "the relation between the reciprocal lattice vector and the four excitation modes is the same as that in the l - edge case .",
    "however , the two modes are mixed and the mixing becomes remarkable around the @xmath107-point due to the factor @xmath225 .",
    "the intensity of the structure factor does not show a strong polarization dependence of x - ray in comparison with that in the l - edge case , since the polarization dependence is originated from that in @xmath240 as explained above .",
    "in this paper , we study the orbital excitation in the orbital ordered manganites and the method to observe the excitation by using the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering . at first , we emphasize the noticeable correlation between the static spin structure and the orbital excitation .",
    "the anisotropic spin ordering brings about the anisotropy in the orbital space and causes the gap in the orbital excitation . in this case , the interaction between spin wave and phonon seems to be weak , since the gap in the orbital excitation is of the order of @xmath247 .",
    "this situation is expected to be realized in @xmath3 where the orbital ordered temperature accompanied with the structural phase transition occurs @xmath248 and the a - type antiferromagnetism is realized at @xmath249 .",
    "@xcite although the coupling with the lattice contributes to the gap , it is predicted that the nature of the orbital excitation is changed at @xmath250 and below the temperature the gap becomes more remarkable . on the other hand , in the spin - f case",
    ", the orbital excitation becomes gapless and the low lying excitation affects the thermodynamic and transport properties . in this case , the dispersion relation is modified by the interaction between spin wave and phonon .",
    "the specific heat which is proportional to @xmath251 is derived by the linear dispersion of the orbital wave , which is distinguished from the contribution from the ferromagnetic spin wave .",
    "the possible candidate , where the gapless excitation is anticipated , is the ferromganetic insulating phase realized in the low hole doped manganites , where the superexchange interaction between @xmath5 orbitals dominates the ferromagnetic interaction rather than the double exchange one .",
    "@xcite especially , in @xmath252 , the orbital ordering is confirmed by the resonant elastic x - ray scattering below @xmath253 , and the static jahn - teller distortion is released in this temperature range .",
    "@xcite therefore , the low lying excitation is expected to be observed without disturbance of the lattice distortion . in the spin canted phase among the above two concentration region , the anisotropy of the spin correlation function decreases and the gap in the orbital excitation gradually decreases with doping holes .",
    "such kind of control of the orbital excitation is possible by changing the spin structure in the magnetic field .    as a probe to detect the orbital excitation",
    ", we propose the two possible methods by using the inelastic resonant x - ray scattering . in the present case ,",
    "the dispersion relation is detectable due to the smaller wave length of the x - ray in comparison with the conventional light ( the wave lengths in the l- and k - edge cases are about 2.1@xmath254 and 19.6@xmath254 , respectively ) . in the l - edge case ,",
    "the orbital excitation is directly caused by @xmath255 transition and the single orbital wave without the spin flipping is only brought about . in the spin - f case with orbital @xmath256 , each mode of the orbital wave",
    "is separately observed by choosing the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath168 .",
    "this selection rule between the reciprocal lattice vector and the modes of the orbital wave is mainly due to the fact that the inelastic part of the scattering matrix is represented by the @xmath81 component of the pseudo spin operator .",
    "since the large scattering intensity is expected in the low energy region near the orbital superlattice reflection point , it may be observed without disturbance of the large fundamental elastic peak .",
    "the polarization dependence is remarkable , since it directly comes from the coupling constant between electron and photon . in the k - edge case , where the elastic scattering has already been used to observe the orbital ordering",
    ", the orbital excitation occurs through the screening process of the core hole .",
    "this process through the charge transfer from one of the nearest neighboring mn ions is more favorable in manganites rather than in cuprates and nickelates , since the manganites are closer to the boundary between the charge transfer insulator and the mott one .",
    "the one and two orbital wave excitations are possible in the same order , unlike the conventional two magnon raman scattering .",
    "the orbital excitation occurs in the site where the x - ray excites the @xmath130 electron and its one of the nearest neighboring mn sites .",
    "owing to the unique excitation process , the structure factor shows the strong momentum dependence and in particular the intensity vanishes around the @xmath4-point . through the measurement of the characteristic momentum dependence ,",
    "it is possible to identify the orbital sector in the inelastic component and the mechanism of the orbital excitation proposed in this paper .",
    "acknoledgements    the authors would like to thank y. endoh , y. murakami and j. mizuki for their valuable discussions .",
    "we also indebted to m. kaji and s. okamoto for their helpful discussions and calculations .",

    "part of the numerical calculation was performed in the hitacs-3800/380 supercomputing facilities in institute for materials research , tohoku university .",
    "in this appendix , we introduce the elastic x - ray scattering in the l - edge case as a method to detect the orbital order .",
    "we focus on the polarization and orbital dependence of the atomic scattering factor in the orbital ordered phase .",
    "once the dependence is revealed , the scattering intensity in the several orbital ordering is obtained by the formulas in ref . .",
    "the atomic scattering factor is calculated by the perturbational calculation presented in sect .",
    "iiia and given by @xmath257 as well as in the inelastic case , we approximately set up the state and the energy for the intermediate states in the scattering .",
    "we assume that the states consist of the following three states : @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 , where @xmath261 represents the state where two @xmath5 electrons occupy the different orbital with the spin singlet ( triplet ) and @xmath262 is the doubly occupied state in the @xmath33 orbital .",
    "these energies are approximately estimated as @xmath263 with @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 , where @xmath4 is the damping constant . because @xmath267 is the smallest",
    ", @xmath258 dominates the l - edge .",
    "it is noticed that the energy @xmath267 is independent of the occupied @xmath127 orbital and the polarization of x - ray , because two @xmath5 orbitals are occupied in the intermediate state and three @xmath126 orbitals are occupied in the initial and final states . on the other hand , its intensity in eq.([eq : fela ] )",
    "is proportional to @xmath268 which clearly depends on the occupied orbital and the polarization as shown in eq.([eq : aaa ] ) .",
    "it is concluded that the anisotropy of the scattering factor is originated from the coupling constant between electron and photon , unlike that in the k - edge case where the coulomb interaction between @xmath127 and @xmath131 gives rise to the anisotropy .",
    "@xcite for example , in the antiferro - type orbital ordering , where two kinds of the orbital sublattice exist , the scattering intensity at the orbital superlattice reflection is proportional to @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the unoccupied orbital state in the a(b)-orbital sublattice .",
    "in this appendix , we present the detailed derivation and formulation of the effective hamiltonian and transition probability in the k - edge case which are introduced in sect .",
    "iii b.    in derivation of the effective hamiltonian , the unperturbed states are classified by the number of electron of mn @xmath127 and @xmath131 orbitals at each site as @xmath271 and these states and energies are approximately set up as follows .",
    "the energy in @xmath272 is defined as the origin of the energy .",
    "@xmath273 consists of @xmath274 and its energy is difined as @xmath275 with @xmath276 .",

    "the @xmath6 spin is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath5 one and the spin dependence of the core hole interaction are neglected . among these parameters ,",
    "we choose the independent parameters @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath294 with @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian @xmath298 is derived by the conventional canonical transformation .",
