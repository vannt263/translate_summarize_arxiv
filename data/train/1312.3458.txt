    "blazars are a class of active galaxies that are among the most powerful and dynamic extragalactic objects .",
    "they exhibit rapid flares in radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray wavebands .",
    "the general absence of emission lines in their optical spectra , originally the identifying feature of bl lac objects like _ bl lacertae _ , together with detections of polarization in both radio and optical bands , suggests that the radio - to - optical continuum is non - thermal synchrotron radiation . in many blazars",
    ", this component extends to x - rays .",
    "the watershed development that isolated the class of blazars was the discovery@xcite of transient gamma - ray emission in 3c 279 and mrk 421 by the egret instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory at around 100 mev  1 gev .",
    "this was almost contemporaneous with the determination that mrk 421 also emitted at tev energies@xcite .",
    "the prevailing thought is that this gamma - ray signal is generated by inverse compton scattering of either an ir / optical / uv photon source of possibly disk or ambient origin@xcite , or of synchrotron photons by the same electrons that emit this radio - to - x - ray signal , so - called synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models@xcite .",
    "an important recent development for blazar science has been the improvement of sensivity in the 100 mev-100 gev window , afforded by the _ fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) . over the last five years",
    ", lat data has enabled measurements of the power - law index of blazar spectra@xcite , and therefore also the index of the underlying non - thermal particle population .",
    "the flux variability and enormous power of blazars indicate that they possess central supermassive black holes with masses typically above , and are characterized by powerful jets that emanate from near the event horizon and point almost directly towards earth .",
    "the rapid variability seen in gev ",
    "tev flares drives the prevailing picture for the blazar environment : their jets are relativistic , and compactly structured on small spatial scales that are unresolvable by present gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "velocity structure in the supersonic outflow in these jets naturally generates relativistic shocks , and these can form the principal sites for acceleration of electrons and perhaps ions to the ultrarelativistic energies demanded by the x - ray and @xmath0-ray data@xcite .",
    "diffusive acceleration at such shocks is believed to be the main mechanism for energizing such charges@xcite .",
    "this is because it is both extremely efficient and very fast , precipitating acceleration rates of the order of the gyrofrequency , since the diffusive collisions of electrons and ions with mhd turbulence in jets is usually dominated by gyroresonant interactions .",
    "the diffusive mean free path of a charge is then at least comparable to its larmor radius if it has a momentum and lorentz factor ; the regime is known as the bohm limit .",
    "this scenario invokes a conversion of the ballistic kinetic energies of colliding , large - scale mhd structures in jets into the energization of particles at relativistic shocks .",
    "other paradigms such as acceleration by reconnection of magnetic fields embedded in poynting - flux dominated outflows can be envisaged .",
    "yet , there is presently no compelling reason to disavow the shock acceleration picture for blazar jets .    to explore the shock paradigm ,",
    "the standard practice has been to develop multiwavelength ( mw ) spectral models , spanning radio to tev gamma - ray wavelengths@xcite .",
    "this generally gives a broad - brush assessment of a range of jet environment parameters , but the spectral fits in any one band are of limited quality .",
    "the high statistics spectroscopy offered by the _ fermi - lat _ data demands a closer look at the constraints observations can make on the shock acceleration process and the blazar jet environment . for example , it has long been known that non - relativistic shocks generate a power - law index that is dependent only on the hydrodynamic velocity compression ratio across the shock@xcite . for strong shocks with",
    ", this yields a distribution .",
    "this robustness has helped underpin a consensus that galactic cosmic rays originate in supernova remnants .",
    "in contrast , the convective loss rates downstream of relativistic shocks are sensitive to the orientation of the mean magnetic field , and the character of the _ in situ _ mhd turbulence , yielding a wide variety of power - law indices for accelerated charges for a given velocity compression ratio@xcite . accordingly , gamma - ray spectroscopy of blazars can afford insights into details of the structure of shocks in jets .",
    "in addition , it has been understood for nearly two decades@xcite that diffusive shock acceleration is so efficient that low levels of field turbulence ( spawning ) are required to accommodate synchrotron spectral peaks appearing in the x - ray band .    in gleaning such insights ,",
    "multi - wavelength blazar models generally invoke an elemental description of the distribution of accelerated charges , usually a power - law truncated at some minimum particle lorentz factor .",
    "such forms omit the hot maxwellian - like components that naturally arise due to shock layer turbulent dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy of the upstream flow .",
    "this paper goes beyond such simplified approaches by employing detailed results from comprehensive monte carlo simulations of diffusive acceleration at relativistic shocks , building upon the exposition of summerlin & baring@xcite .",
    "these simulations capture the relationship between turbulence parameters and the power - law index , and also the connection between the thermal bulk of the population and the power - law tail of the accelerated species .",
    "we fold these results through the one - zone ssc / external compton models of bttcher et al.@xcite for radiation emission and transport in blazars . in particular , diagnostics are obtained for the frequency of particle scattering and the level of field turbulence for the bl lac object ao 0235 + 164 . by exploring a range of dependences of the diffusive mean free path on the momentum of accelerated charges , the possible interpretation that turbulence levels decline with remoteness from a shock is identified , perhaps signalling a significant role for non - gyroresonant diffusion near blazar jet shocks .",
    "in collisionless shocks , non - thermal , charged particles gain energy by scattering between mhd turbulence that is `` anchored '' in the converging upstream and downstream plasmas . in non - relativistic shocks , the energetic particles are nearly isotropic in these fluid frames , since their speeds far exceed ( ) , the upstream ( downstream ) flow speed component in the co - ordinate direction normal to the shock .",
    "the acceleration process possesses no momentum scale , and the resulting distribution takes the form , where , for being the shock s velocity compression ratio .",

    "in contrast , in relativistic shocks , plasma anisotropy is prevalent , and becomes a function of the flow speed , the field obliquity , and the nature of the scattering .",

    "note that relativistic shocks in blazar environs are typically highly oblique ( ) due to the lorentz transformation of ambient , upstream magnetic fields to the shock rest frame .",
    "various approaches have been adopted to model diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) at relativistic discontinuities .",
    "these include analytic methods@xcite , and monte carlo simulations of convection and diffusion@xcite .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) plasma simulations have also been employed to study this problem via modeling the establishment of turbulence self - consistently@xcite , though they can not yet explore acceleration beyond modest non - thermal energies .",
    "the monte carlo approach is ideal for describing the diffusive acceleration of particles from thermal ( injection ) scales out to the highest energies relevant to blazar jet models .",
    "the monte carlo technique employed here solves the boltzmann equation with a phenomenological scattering operator@xcite .",

    "hadronic models are also of great interest , but then introduce more parameters , and so do nt tend to provide constraints that are as restrictive as those explored here .    to evaluate the emission from the monte carlo generated electron distributions described in the previous section , we adopt radiation modules from the one zone blazar radiation transfer code of bttcher et al.@xcite .",

    "this cohesive application of simulated acceleration distributions to blazar spectral modeling provides essentially unprecedented insights into the plasma environment of extragalactic jets . since shock acceleration feeds off a prominent thermal population of charges , low synchrotron `` peak '' frequency sources like ao 0235 + 164 should possess strong bulk comptonization signatures from this thermal component .",

    "we argue here that this strong momentum dependence of is not unexpected , due to somewhat constrained inertial ranges of plasma turbulence , associated non - gyroresonant diffusion , and perhaps also a decline in the level of such turbulence away from shocks that inject energetic particles into the much larger blazar jet emission zones .",

    "<S> diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) at relativistic shocks is likely to be an important acceleration mechanism in various astrophysical jet sources , including radio - loud agn . </S>",
    "<S> an important recent development for blazar science is the ability of fermi - lat data to pin down the power - law index of the high energy portion of emission in these sources , and therefore also the index of the underlying non - thermal particle population . </S>",
    "<S> this diagnostic potential was not possible prior to fermi launch , when gamma - ray information was dominated by the highly - absorbed tev band . </S>",
    "<S> this paper highlights how multiwavelength spectra including x - ray band and fermi data can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in relativistic , oblique , mhd shocks in blazar jets . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index of the non - thermal particle distributions resulting from monte carlo simulations of dsa , and the fraction of thermal particles accelerated to non - thermal energies , depend sensitively on the particles mean free path scale , and also on the magnetic field obliquity to the shock normal . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate self - consistently the radiative synchrotron / compton signatures of the resulting thermal and non - thermal particle distributions . </S>",
    "<S> important constraints on the frequency of particle scattering and the level of field turbulence are identified for the blazar ao 0235 + 164 . the possible interpretation that turbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks , and a significant role for non - gyroresonant diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> are discussed . </S>"
