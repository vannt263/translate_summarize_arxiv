    "structural , kinematic and photometric properties of ulirgs show that they are originated from major mergers and they averagely fall on the fundamental plane of moderate - mass ellipticals ( stellar mass @xmath7@xmath8 ) , but are well offset from giant ellipticals , suggesting that ulirg mergers are ellipticals in formation ( genzel et al .",

    "<S> we present a stellar population synthesis study of a type i luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) : irasf13308 + 5946 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a quasar with absolute magnitude @xmath0 and has a spectral feature of a seyfert 1.5 galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2000 ) and leitherer et al.s ( 2002 ) extinction curves , we estimate the past infrared ( ir ) luminosities of the host galaxy and find it may have experienced an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) phase for nearly 300myr , so this galaxy has probably experienced a type i ulirg phase . both nuclear starburst and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) contribute to the present ir luminosity budget , and starburst contributes @xmath170% . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) is @xmath2 and the eddington ratio @xmath3 is 0.12 , which both approximate to typical values of pg qsos . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that irasf13308 + 5946 is probably at the transitional phase from a type i ulirg to a classical qso . </S>"
