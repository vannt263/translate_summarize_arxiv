    "@xcite suggest that an operator for time could be defined and introduced to the non - relativistic schrdinger s equation , which would recast it in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 with the dimension of inverse energy is introduced through appropriate deformed algebra .",
    "the resulting feature of ( [ eq1 ] ) is that there will result two distinct energy eigenvalues , and thus the the time - coordinate would acquire a minimum time - step feature . while the subject of time has been quite controversial , as nicely summarized by muller @xcite , the existence of a hermitian time - operator has been a subject of long debate .",
    "pauli @xcite was the first to point out that it was impossible to have such an operator of time .",
    "he did not present a well - founded proof , however , and his reason was that the time needed to be a continuous variable while energy eigenstates must be bounded from below @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint has been followed in many of the later studies which have been discussed in several recent reviews of this subject @xcite .",
    "however , it has been rigorously shown @xcite that a self - adjoint hermitian time - of - arrival operator can be indeed accurately defined and used .",
    "also , in his comment @xcite and earlier works @xcite , sidharth also points out the possibility of discreteness at the compton scale to develop a consistent theoretical framework for cosmology .",
    "it is here shown that this is in fact quite possible in the fully relativistic picture of quantum mechanics , without retaining to such a non - standard algebra .",
    "the @xmath4 dirac s equation subject to a potential reads @xmath5^{+ } & c\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\hat{\\bf p } \\\\",
    "c\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\hat{\\bf p } & -mc^2+[\\mathbb{v}]^{- }   \\end{bmatrix } \\begin{bmatrix }   \\ket{\\psi^{+}}\\\\   \\ket{\\psi^{- } }   \\end{bmatrix }   =   i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } \\begin{bmatrix }   \\ket{\\psi^{+}}\\\\   \\ket{\\psi^{- } }   \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] are appropriate perturbing spin - matrix potentials for particles and antiparticles , and @xmath7 are spinors . the vector @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 are @xmath12 pauli s spin matrices @xcite . the @xmath12 identity matrix @xmath13=\\sigma_0 $ ] has not been shown for the convenience of notation . the above equation may be rearranged by taking time - derivatives from each row of ( [ eq2 ] ) and straightforward substitution , to yield the modified @xmath4 schrdinger s equation of the type @xmath14 \\ket{\\vec{\\psi}},\\ ] ] similar to ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath15 .",
    "curiously , this value of @xmath3 satisfies the expected upper bound of @xmath16 @xcite by many orders of magnitude , even for a particle as light as electron for which @xmath17 . also , one would obtain @xmath18&=&\\begin{bmatrix }   -[\\mathbb{v}^{+}]-\\frac{1}{m}\\hat{p}^2 & c\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\hat{\\bf p } \\\\",
    "c\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\hat{\\bf p } & -[\\mathbb{v}^{-}]+\\frac{1}{m}\\hat{p}^2   \\end{bmatrix},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] correct to the first order in @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "this hamiltonian will clearly in general lead to four distinct eigenvalues by using the perturbation technique , for particles and anti - particles if @xmath20\\neq -[\\mathbb{v}^{-}]$ ] ( broken fundamental cpt symmetry ) and also @xmath6 $ ] are non - degenerate themselves .",
    "but if only @xmath6 $ ] are kept as non - degenerate ( for instance , by having different interactions for different spins ) then one could obtain the expected split between the two eigenmodes of the system for either particles or anti - particles . in that case , the concept of time crystals and a minimum time - step as discussed and introduced therein @xcite would be immediately plausible .",
    "the question of existence of an algebraic form for a self - adjoint time operator of dirac s equation has been unsolved for a long time , and mostly people have come up with approximate solutions @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite argued that the correct time operator of dirac s equation should not be conjugate to the original hamiltonian , and followed a time of arrival formalism to proceed with a closed form .",
    "uncertainty relationships have been reviewed in a recent survey article @xcite and connections of the theory of time to various applications such as tunneling @xcite has been discussed .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to construct a @xmath0 time operator @xmath21 for spin-@xmath1 particles in free space , in such a way that the commutator is exactly equal to @xmath22 , subject to the condition that the angular momentum operator @xmath23 identically vanishes .",
    "this latter criterion can be physically satisfied at ease for the case of propagation of particles in free space without presence of electromagnetic fields , while preserving their intrinsic spin property . for the case of a non - vanishing angular momentum",
    ", analytical construction of the time operator seems not to be feasible . even though , this is to the best knowledge of the author , the first conclusive and unambiguous determination of an analytical time operator , which is also compatible with the relativistic dirac s picture and particle spin",
    ".    this will give rise , after tedious algebra done by hand , to the expression of the relativistic time operator @xmath24 where the @xmath0 dirac hamiltonian @xmath25 is @xmath26 in derivation of ( [ eq5 ] ) one should make use of the identities @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . despite the fact that direct derivation of ( [ eq5 ] ) is very lengthy , it is not difficult to check directly by substitution that together ( [ eq6 ] ) and vanishing angular momentum they indeed exactly satisfy @xmath29=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "the conjugate relationships are now simple given by @xcite @xmath30 \\ket{\\vec{\\psi}},\\\\ \\nonumber     -i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e }   \\ket{\\vec{\\chi}}=[\\mathbb{t } ] \\ket{\\vec{\\chi}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 state ket of the system in energy representation , as opposed to the @xmath33 in ( [ eq4 ] ) is the familiar @xmath32 state ket of the system in time representation .",
    "hence , the energy and time eigenstates may be found be solution of the equations @xcite @xmath34 \\ket{\\vec{\\psi}_e},\\\\ \\nonumber t \\ket{\\vec{\\chi}_t}&=[\\mathbb{t } ] \\ket{\\vec{\\chi}_t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are energy and time eigenvalues , and @xmath37 is the _ time - dependent energy eigenstate _ , while @xmath38 is the _ energy - dependent time - eigenstate_. these are evidently related through the fourier transformation pairs as @xcite @xmath39 the energy spectrum of dirac equation is well - known and given by @xmath40 , which can be obtained readily in the momentum space .",
    "calculation of the time spectrum can also be done in the momentum - space , using the substituions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to the matrix differential eigenvalue equation @xmath43 which can be investigated by numerical methods .",
    "quite remarkably , in the non - relativistic limit with @xmath44 , the time - operator is diagonalized and for particles reduces to the scalar form @xmath45 which also satisfies the commutation @xmath46=i\\hbar$ ] with the newtonian kinetic energy operator @xmath47 .",
    "the time - eigenvalues here constitute a continuous spectrum over the entire real axis , while the time - eigenfunctions are found from the first - order nonlinear differential equation @xmath48 the equation ( [ eq12 ] ) admits an exact solution @xmath49,\\ ] ] with @xmath50 being the euler s exponential integral function and @xmath51 is a constant , determining the initial conditions at zero energy and @xmath3 is a normalization constant . setting @xmath52 differentiates the solutions corresponding to particles and anti - particles , occupying the positive or negative energy levels , as @xmath53,\\\\ \\nonumber    \\chi_e^-({\\bf p})=\\alpha\\exp(-\\frac{iep^2}{\\hbar m})[{\\textrm{ei}}(\\frac{iep^2}{\\hbar m})-i\\pi].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we set @xmath54 for particles and obtain the particle time eigenfunctions .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] illustrate the variations of particle time eigenfunctions versus energy in momentum space .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are the same but for antiparticles .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and since the particles can not attain negative energies , the probablity density function decays rapidly to zero , while it quickly attains a nearly fixed value for positive energies .",
    "this reveals that particles can indeed have negative energies , too , but with vanishingly small probablity , while the occupation probablity for positive energies is also not accurately constant around zero energy .",
    "therefore , with proper choice of the normalization constant @xmath3 , we may approximate the probablity density of time eigenfunctions in momentum space simply as @xmath55 for particles , and @xmath56 for antiparticles , with @xmath57 being the unit - step function .",
    "this , of course , not only quite reasonably meets the generally expected behavior of classical physics in the limit of @xmath58 , but also resolves the long - held assertion of wolfgang pauli s debate @xcite regarding the existence of a self - adjoint time operator , that the energy spectrum should be bounded from below .",
    "it is possible that findings of this paper could have immediate use in the theory of ultrarelativistic neutrino oscillations @xcite and other spin-@xmath1 particles @xcite as well .    as a final remark ,",
    "the time operator ( [ eq11 ] ) has been obtained from the non - relativistic limit of ( [ eq10 ] ) , which removes any ambiguity with regard to the nonuniqueness of the time operator @xcite .",
    "having both the hamiltonian @xmath59 and time operator @xmath21 known , we may construct a new bosonic quasi - particle field @xcite out of the harmonic - oscillator system @xcite as @xmath60 in which @xmath61 and @xmath62 obviously satisfy @xmath63=1 $ ] because of @xmath46=i\\hbar$ ] , and are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the bosonic quasi - particles , which we here refer to as _ energons_.    in a strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , the time operator ( [ eq11 ] ) has to change a bit as @xmath64 and this allows to write down the differential equation for the zero energon @xmath65 in momentum space @xmath66 as @xmath67\\zeta_0(p)=0,\\ ] ] with @xmath68 being the momentum representation of the ground state with zero number of energons .",
    "the normalized ground - state solution is @xmath69.\\ ] ] by successive application of @xmath62 to the ground state @xmath70 , the next number states could be easily constructed using @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , of course , we have the conjugate ladder identity as @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , we may observe that @xmath73,\\\\ \\nonumber \\zeta_2(p)&=&\\frac{p^4 - 2(mc)^4}{2\\pi^\\frac{1}{4}(mc)^5}\\sqrt{p } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{p}{mc}\\right)^4\\right],\\\\ \\nonumber \\zeta_3(p)&=&\\frac{p^4 - 6(mc)^4}{4\\sqrt{3}\\pi^\\frac{1}{4}(mc)^7}p^2\\sqrt{2p } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{p}{mc}\\right)^4\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so on .",
