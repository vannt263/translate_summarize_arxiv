    "a remarkable recent story in mathematics was the proof of the shapiro conjecture ( in real algebraic geometry ) by mukhin , tarasov , and varchenko  @xcite using methods from integrable systems .",
    "its simplest form involves the wronski map , which sends a @xmath0-dimensional complex linear subspace of univariate polynomials of degree @xmath1 to its wronskian , a polynomial of degree @xmath2 . in this context",
    ", the mukhin - tarasov - varchenko theorem states that if a polynomial @xmath3 of degree @xmath2 has all of its roots real , then _ every _ @xmath0-plane of polynomials with wronskian @xmath3 is real ( i.e. , has a basis of real polynomials ) .",
    "the wronskian is a map from a grassmannian to a projective space , both of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "eremenko and gabrielov  @xcite considered the real wronski map that sends the real grassmannian to real projective space , computing its topological degree ( actually the degree of a lift to oriented double covers ) .",
    "this topological degree is strictly positive when @xmath4 is odd , so that for @xmath4 odd , there are always real @xmath0-planes of polynomials with given real wronskian , proving a weak version of the shapiro conjecture .",
    "the full shapiro conjecture went far beyond the reality of the wronski map .",
    "it concerned , more generally , intersections of schubert varieties given by flags osculating a rational normal curve ( osculating instances of schubert problems ) , positing that if the osculating points were all real , then all of the points of intersection were also real . when the schubert varieties are all hypersurfaces , the conjecture asserted that the fibers of the wronski map over polynomials with all roots real contained only real subspaces .",
    "initially considered too strong to be true , the shapiro conjecture came to be accepted due to significant computer experimentation  @xcite and partial results  @xcite .",
    "fibers of the wronski map over a polynomial @xmath3 with distinct roots are intersections of hypersurface schubert varieties given by flags osculating the rational normal curve at the roots of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 is real , its roots form a real variety ( stable under complex conjugation ) and the corresponding intersection of schubert varieties is also real .",
    "eremenko and gabrielov s topological degree is a lower bound for the number of real points in that real intersection . in related work ,",
    "azar and gabrielov  @xcite proved a lower bound for the number of real rational functions of degree @xmath5 with @xmath6 real critical points and two real points where the function values coincide .",
    "( this is a lower bound for a family of schubert problems on a flag manifold given by osculating flags and was motivated by data from the experiment  @xcite . )",
    "these results suggested the possibility of lower bounds for the number of real points in an intersection of schubert varieties given by flags osculating the rational normal curve , when the intersection is a real variety .",
    "a preliminary investigation  @xcite confirmed this possibility and uncovered other structures in the numbers of real solutions , including upper bounds , lower bounds , gaps , and a congruence modulo four , in different families of schubert problems .",
    "those data led to two papers  @xcite which proved some of the observed structure .",
    "we describe the design , execution , and some results of a large - scale computer experiment  @xcite to study such real osculating instances of schubert problems .",
    "this study investigated over 344 million instances of 756 schubert problems , and it used over 549 gigahertz - years of computing .",
    "the topological lower bounds of eremenko and gabrielov  @xcite apply to variants of the wronski map and were extended by soprunova and sottile  @xcite to give topological lower bounds to osculating schubert problems where at most two schubert varieties were not hypersurfaces .",
    "we studied 273 such osculating schubert problems and observed that these topological lower bounds were sharp for all except six of them .",
    "four of these six continue to defy explanation . for the remaining two",
    ", the lack of sharpness is due to a congruence modulo four observed in both  @xcite and  @xcite for certain symmetric schubert problems .",
    "this congruence has since been established by hein and sottile in collaboration with zelenko .",
    "they first  @xcite treated osculating schubert problems and established a weak form of the congruence .",
    "later , they showed that many symmetric schubert problems in a grassmannian given by isotropic flags ( symplectic or orthogonal ) have a congruence modulo four on their number of real solutions  @xcite .",
    "for example , table  [ t : intro ] summarizes the computation for two schubert problems in @xmath7 , each with twelve solutions .     &",
    "@xmath8&@xmath9&@xmath10&@xmath11 & @xmath12&@xmath13&@xmath14 & + @xmath15    ' '' ''    & 81912&&88738&&7086&&222264&*400000 * + @xmath16    ' '' ''    & 214375&&231018&&61600&&293007&*800000 * +    together these used @xmath17 gigahertz - days of computing .",
    "the columns are the number of observed instances with a given number of real solutions .",
    "we only list even numbers , for the number of real solutions is congruent modulo two to the number of complex solutions .",
    "empty cells indicate that no instances were observed with that number of real solutions .",
    "notice that the partitions encoding the schubert problems are symmetric , and that the observed numbers of real solutions satisfy an additional congruence modulo four .",
    "this congruence occurs for a symmetric schubert problem in @xmath18 when the sum of the lengths of the diagonals of its partitions is at least @xmath19 .",
    "this sum is eight for both problems of table  [ t : intro ] .",
    "five problems studied exhibited lower bounds and other structures in their observed numbers of real solutions .",
    "these problems form members of a family of schubert problems , one in each grassmannian , which we prove have this unusual structure on numbers of real solutions .",
    "we shall show that real solutions to an osculating instance correspond to real factorizations of an associated polynomial , explaining the observed structures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : definitions ] we provide background on the schubert calculus , the history of the shapiro conjecture , and the work of eremenko and gabrielov on topological lower bounds .",
    "we then describe the setup , execution , and some of the observations resulting from the experimental project in section  [ s : experiment ] . in section  [ s :",
    "factorization ] , we explain the lower bounds and gaps coming from a family of schubert problems whose determination we reduce to factoring certain polynomials . in section  [ s : further ] , we conclude with a discussion of some frequency tables exhibiting interesting structure .",
    "we first establish our notation and definitions regarding the osculating schubert calculus , give some additional history of the shapiro conjecture , and finally discuss the topological lower bounds of eremenko - gabrielov and soprunova - sottile .",
    "let @xmath20 be positive integers .",
    "the grassmannian ( or ) is the set of all @xmath0-dimensional linear subspaces ( @xmath0-planes ) of @xmath21 , which is a complex manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "complex conjugation on @xmath21 induces a conjugation on @xmath22 .",
    "the points of @xmath22 fixed by conjugation are its real points , and they form the grassmannian @xmath23 of @xmath0-planes in @xmath24 .",
    "the grassmannian has distinguished schubert varieties , which are given by the discrete data of a partition and the continuous data of a flag .",
    "a is a weakly decreasing sequence @xmath25 of integers and a is a filtration of @xmath21 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the flag @xmath28 is real if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , so that it is the complexification of a flag in @xmath24 . given a partition @xmath31 and a flag @xmath28 , the associated schubert variety is @xmath32 this is an irreducible subvariety of the grassmannian of codimension @xmath33 . from the definition , we see that @xmath34 .",
    "a list @xmath35 of partitions which satisfies the numerical condition @xmath36 is a .",
    "given a schubert problem @xmath37 and general flags @xmath38 @xmath39 , kleiman s transversality theorem  @xcite implies that the intersection @xmath40 is generically transverse .",
    "the numerical condition   implies that it is zero - dimensional ( or empty ) and therefore consists of finitely many points .",
    "the number of points does not depend upon the choice of general flags and may be computed using algorithms from the schubert calculus  @xcite .",
    "the intersection   is an of the schubert problem @xmath37 and its points are the to this instance .",
    "we will not be concerned with general instances of schubert problems but rather with instances given by flags that osculate a common rational normal curve .",
    "let @xmath41 be the following parameterized rational normal curve @xmath42 ( this choice of @xmath43 is no restriction as all rational normal curves are projectively equivalent . ) for each @xmath44 , the has as its @xmath30-dimensional subspace the @xmath30-plane @xmath45 osculating the curve @xmath43 at @xmath46 : @xmath47 ( the remaining entries in this matrix are zero .",
    ")    an of a schubert problem @xmath37 is one given by osculating flags , @xmath48 here , @xmath49 are distinct points of @xmath50 .",
    "osculating flags are not general for intersections of schubert varieties as demonstrated in  @xcite , so kleiman s theorem does not imply that the intersection   is transverse",
    ". however , eisenbud and harris  @xcite noted that if @xmath51 then its wronskian @xmath52 vanishes to order @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "as the wronskian ( a form on @xmath50 ) has degree @xmath2 , they deduced that   is at most zero - dimensional .",
    "later , mukhin , tarasov , and varchenko  @xcite showed that the intersection is transverse when @xmath49 are real ( and therefore also when they are general ) .",
    "eisenbud and harris also noted that if @xmath55 is a root of order @xmath56 of the wronskian @xmath57 of @xmath58 , then there is a unique partition @xmath31 with @xmath59 such that @xmath51 .",
    "this implies the following partial converse to schubert problems .",
    "[ p : uniqueness ] for each @xmath60 , there is a unique schubert problem @xmath37 and unique points @xmath61 for which @xmath58 lies in the intersection  .    to simplify notation",
    ", we henceforth write for the schubert variety @xmath62 .    as @xmath63 ,",
    "we have @xmath64 , and therefore @xmath65 . a consequence of these observations and proposition  [ p : uniqueness ] is the following corollary .",
    "[ cor : realoscinst ] let @xmath66 be a schubert problem and @xmath61 be distinct .",
    "the instance @xmath67 of the schubert problem @xmath37 is a real variety if and only if for each @xmath68 there exists @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    corollary  [ cor : realoscinst ] asserts that the obviously sufficient condition for an osculating instance of a schubert problem to be a real variety , namely that each complex conjugate pair of osculation points have the same schubert condition , is in fact necessary .",
    "one motivation for studying real osculating instances of schubert problems is the conjecture of shapiro and shapiro , which was given two different proofs by mukhin , tarasov , and varchenko .",
    "given any osculating instance of a schubert problem @xmath72 in which @xmath73 , the intersection is transverse with all of its points real .",
    "the shapiro conjecture was made by the brothers boris and michael shapiro in 1993 , and popularized through significant computer experimentation and partial results  @xcite .",
    "an asymptotic version ( where the points @xmath74 are sufficiently clustered and all except two of the @xmath75 consist of one part ) was proven in  @xcite .",
    "the first breakthrough was given by eremenko and gabrielov  @xcite who used complex analysis to prove it when @xmath76 .",
    "in this case it is equivalent to the statement that a rational function whose critical points lie on a circle in @xmath50 maps that circle to a circle .",
    "later , mukhin , tarasov , and varchenko proved the full conjecture  @xcite using methods from mathematical physics .    while the shapiro conjecture may be formulated in any flag manifold , it is false in general ( except for the orthogonal grassmannian  @xcite ) .",
    "significant experimental work has uncovered the limits of its validity , as well as generalizations and extensions that are likely true  @xcite , and has led to a proof of one generalization ( the monotone conjecture ) in a special case  @xcite .",
    "for a complete account , see  @xcite or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "914 ) .",
    "while studying the shapiro conjecture , eremenko and gabrielov looked at real osculating instances of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is a real set in that @xmath80 , equivalently , @xmath81 is a real polynomial .",
    "the points in   are the fiber of the wronski map over the real polynomial @xmath3 restricted to the schubert variety @xmath82 .",
    "eremenko and gabrielov  @xcite gave a formula for the topological degree of this wronski map restricted to the real points of @xmath82 ( and lifted to an oriented double cover ) .",
    "this topological degree is a on the number of real points in the intersection  .",
    "this follows from the formula for the topological degree of a map @xmath83 between oriented manifolds , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a regular value of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is @xmath88 if the orientation of @xmath89 given by the differential @xmath90 agrees with its orientation from @xmath91 , and @xmath92 if the orientations do not agree .",
    "this was generalized by soprunova and sottile  ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 ) to intersections of the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a real set .",
    "this intersection is again a fiber of the wronski map restricted to @xmath96 ( and lifted to an oriented double cover ) .",
    "they expressed the topological degree in terms of sign - imbalance .",
    "a partition @xmath31 is represented by its young diagram , which is a left - justified array of boxes with @xmath97 boxes in row @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath98 , we have the , which is the set - theoretic difference @xmath99 of their diagrams .",
    "for example , if @xmath100    given @xmath31 , let be the partition @xmath101 , the difference between the @xmath102 rectangle and @xmath31 .",
    "for example , if @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , then @xmath106 . a of shape @xmath107 is a filling of the boxes in @xmath107 with the consecutive integers @xmath108 which increases across each row and down each column .",
    "the is the tableau whose numbers are in reading order . here",
    "are four tableaux of shape @xmath109 .",
    "the first has the standard filling .",
    "@xmath110 let be the set of young tableaux of shape @xmath107 .",
    "each tableau @xmath111 has a parity , @xmath112 , which is the sign of the permutation mapping the standard filling to @xmath111 .",
    "the of @xmath107 is @xmath113    algorithms in the schubert calculus  @xcite imply that the number of complex points in the intersection   is the number @xmath114 of tableaux of shape @xmath115 .",
    "soprunova and sottile show that the topological degree of the appropriate wronski map is the sign - imbalance of @xmath115 .",
    "we deduce the following proposition .",
    "[ p : topological_lower ] if @xmath116 is a real set , then the number of real points in the intersection  @xmath117 is at least the sign - imbalance @xmath118 of @xmath115 .    when @xmath119 , eremenko and gabrielov gave a closed formula for this topological lower bound , which showed that it is strictly positive when @xmath4 is odd and zero when @xmath4 is even  @xcite .",
    "later they showed that if both @xmath4 and @xmath0 are even , there is an intersection   with no real points  @xcite , showing in these cases that the topological lower bound is sharp .",
    "investigating when the topological lower bounds of proposition  [ p : topological_lower ] are sharp and when they are not was a focus of the experiment .",
    "we describe a large computational experiment to study structure in the number of real solutions to real instances of osculating schubert problems .",
    "the data for this experiment kept track of which pairs of the osculating flags were complex conjugate , as preliminary computations and the mukhin - tarasov - varchenko theorem showed that this affected the numbers of real solutions .",
    "the computations were carried out symbolically in exact arithmetic , with real osculating instances of schubert problems being formulated as systems of polynomial equations .",
    "we sketch the execution of the experiment and then close with a discussion of some of the data gathered , which is available to browse online  @xcite .",
    "we have expressed schubert problems @xmath37 as lists of partitions .",
    "also useful and more compact is multiplicative notation .",
    "for example , the schubert problem @xmath120 in @xmath121 with six solutions is written multiplicatively as @xmath122 or as @xmath123 , when we wish to give its number of solutions .",
    "the topological lower bound for the schubert problem @xmath124 in @xmath121 is the sign imbalance @xmath125 .",
    "thus , if the instance @xmath126 of the schubert problem @xmath124 has @xmath127 , then   contains at least two real points .",
    "if @xmath128 then all six points in   are real by the mukhin - tarasov - varchenko theorem .",
    "this illustrates that the lower bound on the number of real solutions to an osculating instance of a schubert problem is sensitive to the number of real osculation points .",
    "given a schubert problem @xmath129 and a corresponding real osculating instance @xmath130 , the of @xmath130 is the list @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the number of schubert varieties of the form @xmath133 containing @xmath130 with @xmath134 real . since @xmath130 is real , we have @xmath135 for each @xmath30 .",
    "table  [ ta:5.1e7=6 ] is from the experiment .",
    "it records how often a given number of real solutions was observed for a given osculation type in 400000 random real instances of the schubert problem @xmath136 .",
    "the solutions to @xmath139 are enumerated by young tableaux of shape @xmath140 filled with @xmath141 copies of each of the numbers @xmath88 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 . since the numbers @xmath88 must fill the first @xmath141 positions in the first row and the numbers @xmath144 must fill the last @xmath141 positions in the second row ,",
    "the only choice is how many numbers 2 are in the first row .",
