    "more tantalisingly , they showed that at very small @xmath10 there appears to be a threshold enhancement  @xcite which , though not as spectacular as that found in the analysis  @xcite of early saclay data , nevertheless indicates a strong @xmath8-deuteron scattering length .",
    "the only measurement of the angular distribution of @xmath8-mesons near threshold suggests that @xmath13-waves can not be neglected in the @xmath8-@xmath14 system for @xmath15  mev  @xcite .",
    "it is here important to note that the differential cross section has the opposite curvature to that of @xmath16 and we will argue that this helps to identify the reaction mechanism . in view of these new data , as well as the experimental advances in @xmath17 and especially @xmath18 , we believe that it is useful to revisit the phenomenological analysis of these reactions .    in the usual theoretical approach , the @xmath12 ( or other ) isobar",
    "is excited in nucleon - nucleon collisions through the exchange of a single meson @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 has a large branching ratio into @xmath20 so that , after its decay , one is left with an @xmath8 plus two nucleons in the final state . though the philosophies are generally rather similar , the theoretical calculations differ in their details as to which exchanges are relevant , the structure of their coupling , and the importance of the associated form factors .",
    "different techniques have been used in order to include the effects of the initial nucleon - nucleon distortion and the final - state interactions .",
    "the neutron - proton final - state interaction can also produce a deuteron in the exit channel and , as we shall see , the ratio of the @xmath2 and @xmath21 cross sections is determined primarily by low - energy neutron - proton dynamics with a weaker dependence upon the production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that in the near - threshold region , @xmath22  mev , the energy variation of the total cross section for the @xmath23 channel is fixed mainly by the @xmath24 factor coming from phase space , modified by the nucleon - nucleon final - state interaction .",
    "it is known , however , that @xmath8 rescattering does produce threshold enhancements in the @xmath25he@xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27he@xmath26  @xcite reactions and it is likely that the residual energy dependence in the @xmath0 excitation function could be due to such an effect .",

    "the relativistic born amplitudes for single - meson exchange are first evaluated at threshold by neglecting all distortions . to include the effects of the final - state interactions",
    "it is , however , necessary to construct a potential from the amplitudes and this is most easily done in configuration space .",

    "values for the @xmath30 amplitudes are also discussed in this section .",
    "there are , of course , measurements of the pion - induced cross section and the @xmath8-nucleon elastic cross section can be deduced from this inside a unitary model . to obtain the necessary vector meson information , we interpret photoproduction data within the framework of the vector meson dominance approach .",
    "the formulae for the bare meson exchange @xmath31 and @xmath2 amplitudes are derived in section  4 ; the energy and angular dependence coming from the @xmath30 amplitudes are there introduced .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the evaluation of the final state interactions in the @xmath6 and @xmath32 systems .",
    "it is found that the enhancement factor varies very fast with excitation energy , and also depends upon isospin in the @xmath33 channel as well as on the mass of the exchanged meson .",
    "in contrast , the distortion of the initial nucleon - nucleon wave is slowly varying and we try to include its effects simply by using the imaginary part of the relevant phase shift . the @xmath8-nucleon final - state interaction is not taken into account , since it would require a consistent three - body treatment in order to include this simultaneously with the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "there is , moreover , as yet no credible @xmath8-nucleon potential from which to calculate the wave function at short distances .",
    "the two - body @xmath2 amplitude is discussed in section  6 .    as shown in section  7 , @xmath3-exchange is more important than @xmath4-exchange , with the @xmath28 giving only minor modifications . taking the @xmath5 interference to be destructive in the proton - proton case ,",
    "these three exchanges reproduce well the measured @xmath34 @xmath35 ratio . since pure @xmath8 exchange would lead to a ratio of below 1 , the results yield an upper bound on the poorly determined @xmath8-nucleon coupling constant . with standard parameters ,",
    "the model reproduces well the magnitude and most of the energy dependence observed in the total cross .",
    "there is an indication that the model underpredicts the @xmath0 data at low @xmath10 and the same is true for the two - body @xmath2 results .",
    "this is probably due to the neglect of @xmath8 rescattering . on the other hand , the reasonable agreement found for the @xmath36 cross",
    "section ratio is mainly a reflection of the @xmath32 final state interaction .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath3 and the destructive effect of the @xmath4 explains also the shape of the @xmath8 angular distribution in @xmath0 , that is larger at @xmath37 than in the forward direction  @xcite .",

    "the difference would be even larger without form factors to regularise the production operators at short distances .",

    "<S> the residual energy dependence may be associated with @xmath8-nucleon rescattering that has not been taken into account . </S>",
