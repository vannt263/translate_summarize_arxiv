    "the randomness can be either due to the choice of a randomized network communication protocol or simply caused by the potential unpredictability of the environment in which the distributed consensus algorithm is implemented @xcite .",

    "random networks lead to a global agreement on a possibly random value , as long as the network is connected in expectation @xcite . while different aspects of consensus algorithms over random switching networks , such as conditions for convergence @xcite and the speed of convergence @xcite , have been widely studied , a characterization of the distribution of the asymptotic consensus value has attracted little attention .",

    "directed _ random graph process . in our model , at each time period , a directed communication link is established between two agents with some exogenously specified probability . due to the potential asymmetry in pairwise communications between different agents ,",

    "instead , agents will asymptotically agree on some random value in the convex hull of the initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , our closed - form characterization of the variance provides a quantitative measure of how dispersed the random agreement point is around the average of the initial conditions in terms of the fundamentals of the model , namely , the structure of the network , the exogenous probabilities of communication , and the initial conditions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",

    "we assume that the weight matrices @xmath8 are randomly generated by an independent and identically distributed matrix process .",

    "we shall use ( [ variance_expression ] ) to extend these results and derive an explicit expression for the mean and an upper - bound for the variance of the asymptotic consensus value over a wider class of switching , directed random graph processes .",

    "hence , our result can be stated as follows :    [ bound asymptotic variance]the variance of the asymptotic consensus value of ( [ consensus_update ] ) can be upper - bounded by@xmath159where @xmath160 are the eigenvalues of @xmath71 and the product @xmath161    we start our proof from ( [ variance bound])@xmath162where we have used lemma [ cho - meyer ] in inequality ( a ) , the expression for @xmath132 in ( [ inf norm bound ] ) in equality ( b ) , and the upper bound in ( [ general spectral bound ] ) in step ( c ) .",
    "we obtain the statement of the theorem by applying the following standard property of the kronecker product : @xmath163 .",

    "for example , given the sequences of degrees and probabilities , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the influence of the network structure on the variance is given via term ( c ) . since the eigenvalues of @xmath18 are key in this term , it is interesting to briefly describe the homogeneous markov chain with transition matrix  @xmath166 .",

    "we conclude that term ( c ) is primarily governed by how close the subdominant eigenvalues of @xmath18 are from @xmath141 . in particular , the further the subdominant eigenvalues of @xmath18 are from 1 , the lower the upper bound in ( [ separation of terms ] ) .",
    "in the next section , we illustrate the relationship between spectral properties of @xmath18  and the variance of the asymptotic consensus value with several numerical simulations .",

    "2 , we represent the leaders using large circles marked as 1,2 , and 3 , and the followers using smaller circles .",
    "we assume that each follower only listen to one leader ( the center of a star ) and nobody else . in this particular example , the first , second and third leaders have @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 followers , respectively . in each time step",

    "2 ) . also , the probability of existence of a directed link coming into a leader is inversely proportional to the degree of the leader .",

    "we have also included in this figure the connection of each leader and one of its followers ( drawn as a smaller circle on top of each leader ) . in this case , the directed link incoming the follower ( leader ) exists with probability @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the rest of followers are represented under each leader , where we represent each pair of directed links as a single undirected edge for clarity . ]    in this example , we compute the asymptotic consensus value for 100 realizations of a random consensus algorithm with initial conditions @xmath182 .",
    "we represent the histogram of these realizations in fig .",
    "3 , where the empirical average of the 100 realizations equals 0.5077 . the theoretical expectation for the asymptotic consensus value applying theorem [ asymptotic mean ] equals @xmath1830.4595 , which is in great accordance with the empirical value . for future reference ,",
    "we have also computed the empirical standard deviation of the 100 realizations to be 0.0298 , and the three eigenvalues of @xmath18 closest to 1 are @xmath184 .          in this subsection",
    ", we numerically illustrate some of the implications of theorem [ bound asymptotic variance ] in the variance of the asymptotic consensus value .",
    "although the upper bound stated in this theorem is not tight , there are some qualitative implications that are consistent throughout our numerical experiments .",
    "for example , as we mentioned in remark [ spectral implications ] , given a set of initial conditions and nodes properties , the upper bound in ( [ separation of terms ] ) is primarily governed by how close the subdominant eigenvalues of @xmath18 are from @xmath141 .",
    "in particular , the further the subdominant eigenvalues of @xmath18 are from 1 , the lower the upper bound .",
    "we illustrate in the following numerical experiments that the lower the upper bound , the lower one should expect the variance to be .    in the first experiment",
    ", we slightly modify the network described in the previous subsection and study the influence of this modification on the eigenvalues of @xmath18 and the variance of @xmath14 .",
    "our first modification is a change in the probabilities of existence of a directed link from the @xmath185-th node to the @xmath47-th leader without changing the network topology .",
    "in particular , we choose the new probabilities to be @xmath186 , for @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in the modified network ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath18 closest to 1 are @xmath187 .",
    "hence , since the effect of our modification on the eigenvalues is to move them away from 1 , we should expect the variance of @xmath14 to be reduced according to remark [ spectral implications ] .",
    "in fact , running 100 random consensus algorithms with the same initial conditions , @xmath188 using our new probabilities , we obtain a standard deviation 0.0286 ( which is less than the 0.0298 obtained before ) .    in the second experiment",
    ", we illustrate how the larger the gap between the eigenvalues of @xmath18 and @xmath141 , the smaller the variance of @xmath14 . in this case",
    ", apart from keeping the new set of probabilities @xmath189 we convert the 3-chain of leaders into a 3-ring of leaders , as depicted in fig .",
    "4 . in this case",
    ", the three eigenvalues of @xmath190 closest to @xmath141 are @xmath191 , which are even further away from 1 than in the second example .",
    "hence , as expected , the standard deviation of 100 random consensus algorithms is even smaller than in the second example , in particular 0.0274 . in conclusion ,",
    "our simulations are consistent with theorem [ bound asymptotic variance ] and with the qualitative behavior described in remark [ spectral implications ] .",
    "we have studied the asymptotic properties of the consensus value in distributed consensus algorithms over switching , directed random graphs . while different aspects of consensus algorithms over random switching networks , such as conditions for convergence and the speed of convergence , have been widely studied , a characterization of the distribution of the asymptotic consensus for general _ asymmetric _ random consensus algorithms remains an open problem .    in this paper , we have derived closed - form expressions for the expectation of the asymptotic consensus value as a function of the set of initial conditions , @xmath192 , and the set of nodes properties , @xmath150 , as stated in theorem [ asymptotic mean ] .",
