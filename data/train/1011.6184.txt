    "phase - space methods were introduced in the very early times of quantum mechanics to avoid some of the troubles arising in the abstract hilbert - space formulation .",
    "the pioneering works of weyl  @xcite , wigner  @xcite , and moyal  @xcite paved thus the way to formally representing quantum mechanics as a statistical theory on phase space  @xcite .    in this approach one looks for a mapping relating operators ( in hilbert space ) to functions ( in phase space ) . in particular ,",
    "quasiprobability distributions are the functions connected with the density operator  @xcite .",
    "usually , the relevant theoretical tools are illustrated with continuous variables ( such as cartesian position and momentum ) , for which much physical knowledge has been inferred .",
    "likewise , the increasing role of qudits in modern quantum information has fuelled a lot of interest in consistently extending these achievements to the case of a discrete phase space  @xcite .",
    "however , other physical problems call for different topologies of the phase space  @xcite . specifically , in this paper we focus on the discrete cylinder @xmath0 ( @xmath1 denotes here the unit circle and @xmath2 the integers ) , which is associated to the canonical pair angle - angular momentum . a number of systems , such as molecular rotations , electron wave packets , hall fluids , and light fields , to cite only a few examples , can be described in terms of this geometry  @xcite . in quantum optics , it is of primary importance to deal with the orbital angular momentum of twisted photons  @xcite , which have been proposed for numerous applications  @xcite .",
    "the proper definition of angles in quantum mechanics has a long history and requires more care than perhaps might be expected  @xcite .",
    "since the conjugate angular momentum has an unbounded spectrum ( that includes positive and negative integers ) , it is , in principle , possible to introduce a _",
    "bona fide _ angle operator .",
    "periodicity , however , brings out subtleties that have triggered long and heated discussions .",
    "we think that a phase - space treatment of this variable may shed light on the origin of all those problems .",
    "a pioneer attempt in that direction was made by mukunda  @xcite , who for the first time constructed a wigner function on the discrete cylinder .",
    "this work was subsequently reelaborated and developed in a variety of directions by other authors  @xcite .",
    "coherent states for this pair have also attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "these accomplishments , as well as some other related questions , such as the associated minimum uncertainty states , are reviewed in great detail by kastrup  @xcite .    in spite of this considerable progress",
    ", there is still the need , in our view , for a comprehensive geometrical approach to this problem , which allows us to integrate in a structured way all the previous knowledge , while providing the right tools to attack recent and attractive problems , such as , e.g. , the tomography of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is precisely to provide such a description .",
    "in this section we recall the structures needed to set up a phase - space description of cartesian quantum mechanics .",
    "this will facilitate comparison with the cylinder later on . for simplicity , we choose one degree of freedom , so the associated phase space is the plane @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant observables are the hermitian coordinate and momentum operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with canonical commutation relation ( with @xmath6 throughout ) @xmath7 = i \\ , { \\hat { { \\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1 } } } } \\ , , \\ ] ] so that they are the generators of the heisenberg - weyl algebra  @xcite .",
    "ubiquitous and profound , this algebra has become the hallmark of noncommutativity in quantum theory .    to avoid technical problems with the unboundedness of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , it is convenient to work with their unitary counterparts @xmath8 whose action in the bases of eigenvectors of position and momentum is @xmath9 so they represent displacements along the corresponding coordinate axes .",
    "the commutation relations are then expressed in the weyl form  @xcite @xmath10 their infinitesimal version immediately gives ( [ eq : hwcom ] ) , but ( [ eq : weyl ] ) is more useful in many instances .    in terms of @xmath11 and",

    "the same holds true for any linear canonical transformation .",
    "finally , the overlap of two density operators is proportional to the integral of the associated wigner functions : @xmath64 this property ( known as traciality ) offers practical advantages , since it allows one to predict the statistics of any outcome , once the wigner function of the measured state is known .",
    "however , the wigner function can take on negative values , a property which distinguishes it from a true probability distribution .",
    "indeed , this negativity is associated with the existence of quantum interference , which itself may be identified as a signal of nonclassical behavior  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of quantum states that are classical , in the sense of giving rise to nonnegative wigner functions , is a topic of undoubted interest . among pure states",
    ", it was proven by hudson  @xcite that the only states that have nonnegative wigner functions are gaussian states  @xcite .",

    "these states have a number of remarkable properties inherited from those of @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , @xmath21 transforms any coherent state in another coherent state : @xmath68 \\ ,    | q + q^{\\prime } , p + p^{\\prime } \\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : comcoh}\\ ] ] the standard choice for the fiducial vector @xmath69 is the vacuum @xmath70 .",
    "this has quite a number of relevant properties , but the one we want to stress for what follows is that @xmath71 is an eigenstate of the fourier transform ( as they are all the fock states )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , over this apparently trivial property rests a huge amount of physical knowledge .",
    "so , @xmath72 is taken as the gaussian @xmath73 in appropriate units .",
    "in addition , this wave function , as any coherent state , represents a minimum uncertainty state , namely @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the corresponding variances .    as a last illustration of the role played by the displacement operators , we note that their completeness allows us to write for any observable @xmath27 @xmath77 \\ , { \\hat { d } } ( q , p ) \\ ,    dq dp \\ , .\\ ] ] evaluating the trace in terms of the set of eigenvectors of the rotated quadratures @xmath78 we obtain  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the kernel @xmath81 the tomograms @xmath82 are measured in a homodyne detector .",
    "this shows that these rotated quadratures provide a complete quorum to reconstruct the density operator and hence the wigner function .",
    "in this section we trace the changes required when we replace the cartesian position by a periodic angular position @xmath83 . for definiteness , we take the window @xmath84 in further considerations . the canonical conjugate variable , denoted now as @xmath85 , is the component of the angular momentum along the axis orthogonal to the rotation plane .",
    "while classically a point particle is necessarily located at a single value of the angle @xmath86 , the corresponding quantum wave function is an object extended around @xmath1 and can be directly affected by the nontrivial topology .",
    "one may be tempted to think that angular position should stand in the same relationship to angular momentum as ordinary position stands to linear momentum .",
    "this would prompt to use the commutation relation @xmath87 = i \\ , { \\hat { { \\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1}}}}$ ] and interpret the angle operator as multiplication by @xmath86 , while @xmath88 is the differential operator @xmath89 .",
    "nevertheless , the use of this operator may entail many pitfalls for the unwary and needs a very subtle analysis  @xcite .",
    "as stressed in the introduction , a long discussion about the properties of this angle operator turns out to be unnecessary to settle a phase - space description .",
    "indeed , let us denote by @xmath90 the basis of angular - momentum eigenstates . in principle , the corresponding eigenvalues can be arbitrary .",

    "let us note that for the vortex state @xmath149 , @xmath216 is diagonal , so the tomograms @xmath220 are independent of @xmath86 and @xmath144 and all of them equal to @xmath221 . performing the integration",
    "we obtain precisely the wigner function in equation ( [ eq : exampleoamstaleell ] ) .",
    "the feasibility of the proposed scheme relies on two crucial points .",
    "first , the implementation of the @xmath216 transformation , which corresponds to a free rotor .",
    "this has been used to describe the evolution in a variety of situations .",
    "second , we need to assess the measurement of the angular spectrum , which can be done only approximately . though the implementation of this scheme may differ depending on the system under considerations , our formulation provides a common theoretical framework on the hilbert space generated by the action of angle and angular momentum .",
    "a experimental demonstration of the method in terms of optical beams has been recently established  @xcite .    for continuous variables ,",
    "it is possible to make a direct sampling of the wigner function by a scheme that determines the parity  @xcite .",
    "this is an unexplored territory for the cylinder that is worth investigating .",
    "in summary , we have shown how to extend in a consistent way all the techniques developed for a continuous - variable phase space to the case of angle and angular momentum .",
    "while we have not left aside the mathematical details , our main emphasis has been on presenting a simple and useful toolkit that any practitioner in the field should master . in our view , far from being an academic curiosity , the ideas expressed here have a wide range of potential applications in numerous hot topics .",
    "this paper has greatly benefited from the criticism and advice of prof .",
