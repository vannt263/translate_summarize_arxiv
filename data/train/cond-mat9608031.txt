    "since the discovery of giant magneto - resistance ( _ gmr _ ) in magnetic multilayers @xcite there has been a great deal of interest in studying this unusual phenomenon also by theoretical methods [ 3 7 ] .",
    "the _ gmr _ was first interpreted phenomenologically with emphasis put on the role of interface roughness @xcite , afterwards quantum mechanical methods were applied , too ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "there is no doubt now that the _ gmr _ does appear even in systems without any imperfections , since this was clearly demonstrated by _ ab initio _ computations in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the current - perpendicular - to - plane _",
    "( cpp)-gmr _ effect in layered systems of the type @xmath4 , where _ w _ stands for a semi - infite ideal lead wire , @xmath5 for a ferromagnet , and _",
    "s _ for the non - magnetic spacer .",
    "the calculation technique , we have developed , is based on the green s function recursion method @xcite .",
    "after having performed the fourier transformation in the _ x - y _ plane , the equation of motion of the green s function has been reduced ( for s.c .",
    "structure ) to a simple tridiagonal eigen - problem quite easy to cope with .",
    "the conductance of electrons of spin @xmath6 is given by the kubo formula , which in turn may be expressed in terms of green s functions as follows , @xcite :      here the index @xmath8 labels the @xmath9-planes , @xmath10 stands for the imaginary part of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the conductance quantum , @xmath13 the cros - ssection area , and the integration is over the 2-dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "hereafter , both the hopping and the lattice constant are taken as energy- and length - units .",
    "in addition to the conductance we have also calculated the thermo - electric power @xmath14 , which is related to @xmath15 by the following well - known formula :          where the superscripts refer to the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations of the two ferromagnets , whereas the subscripts refer to the carrier spin . + it can be seen from fig .  1 that the _ cpp - gmr _ oscillates as a function of the thickness @xmath18 of _ the ferromagnetic slab _ with a short period of @xmath19 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "additionally , in fig .  1 _ pronounced beats _ are seen with typical repetition lengths of roughly @xmath20 ml . in case of fig .",
    "2 with the spacer thickness ( @xmath21 ) being varied , one gets an intermediate period of @xmath22 ml , without any beats .",
    "it is clear from these figs .",
    "that the oscillations of the _ gmtep _ are even stronger than those of the _ gmr _ , although they have a negative bias and a different phase than those of the _ gmr_. in any case the _ gmr _ oscillations decay always roughly as @xmath23 .",
    "+ it was shown in @xcite that the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath15 may arise both from wavenumbers with stationary @xmath24 , as well as from particular cut - off wavenumbers ( @xmath25 ) , for which a spectral density vanishes abruptly at one of the ferromagnet / spacer  interfaces .",
    "+ one can roughly estimate the  rkky - type  wave numbers @xmath26 from the asymptotic equation ( valid actually for large thicknesses and constant potentials ) @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ] by finding the extremum with respect to @xmath28 , with @xmath29=2.5 , we get @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( for all the carriers within the spacer and minority - spin electrons in the ferromagnets ) , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( the majority - spin carriers in the ferromagnets ) .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths can then be calculated as in @xcite from the expression @xmath34 , which yields @xmath35 = 1.825 ( @xmath36 = -1.8 ) , i.e. roughly the short period of two monolayers ( 2 ml ) seen in fig .",
    "it is interesting that in fig .  2 , where only the spacer thickness is varied , only a longer wavelength of @xmath22 ml is visible , which would correspond to @xmath37 . + in order to get the beats seen in fig .",
    "1 one would need , apart from the wave characterized by @xmath38 , another wave with a wavenumber very close to it . as there is no way to get such a wavenumber from eq .",
    "( [ eqkz ] ) , we suppose it to be of _ non - rkky _ character . more insight into the nature of such _ non - rkky _ oscillations",
    "can only be gained by taking into account localized and resonance states in addition to extended ones used for the sketchy estimations above .",
    "although the localized states do not contribute directly to the conductance , certainly they modify the density of states and thereby its value at @xmath29 .",
    "those unextended states are easily seen in our method as singularities ( spread over a large range of energy ) of the local densities of states  we are going to study them analytically in the nearest future .    in conclusion , within an s - band tight - binding model combined with the green s function recursion method , we have reduced the calculation of the _ cpp - gmr _ effectively to one dimension .",
    "we have computed the _ cpp - gmr _ for perfect systems composed of two ferromagnets separated by a non - magnetic spacer and sandwiched between ideal infinite lead wires .",
    "unusual beats of the _ gmr vs. _  the thickness of the ferromagnetic slab thickness have been found and suggested to be due to @xmath39 oscillations .",
    "similar results , with even stronger beats , have also been obtained for the  giant magneto - thermo - electric power  .",
