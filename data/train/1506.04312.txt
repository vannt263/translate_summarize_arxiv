    "<S> strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects of heavy @xmath0-orbital elements have long been neglected in describing the ground states of their compounds thereby overlooking a variety of fascinating and yet unexplored magnetic and electronic states , until recently . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit entangled electrons in such compounds can get stabilized into unusual spin - orbit multiplet @xmath1-states which warrants severe investigations . here </S>",
    "<S> we show using detailed magnetic and thermodynamic studies and theoretical calculations the ground state of ba@xmath2znir@xmath3o@xmath4 , a 6@xmath5 hexagonal perovskite is a close realisation of the elusive @xmath1  =  0 state . however , we find that local ir moments are spontaneously generated due to the comparable energy scales of the singlet - triplet splitting driven by soc and the superexchange interaction mediated by strong intra - dimer hopping . </S>",
    "<S> while the ir ions within the structural ir2o9 dimer prefers to form a spin - orbit singlet state ( sos ) with no resultant moment , substantial interdimer exchange interactions from a frustrated lattice ensure quantum fluctuations till the lowest measured temperatures and stabilize a spin - orbital liquid phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic and magnetic properties of 5@xmath0 transition metal ( tm ) compounds often exhibit unusual properties due to the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which is comparable to their on - site coulomb ( @xmath6 ) and crystal field ( @xmath7 ) interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while quantum numbers @xmath8 ( orbital ) and @xmath9 ( spin ) , for each electron can still be considered good and the spin - orbit coupled many - body multiplets can be denoted by spectroscopic term symbols in the weak spin - orbit ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) coupling limit , the representation gets strongly modified for heavy multielectron elements having strong soc . in such @xmath12-@xmath12  coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> total @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) becomes the only valid quantum number and the multiplets and their degeneracies are all solely determined by the total angular momentum @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic and magnetic response of a system in the @xmath12-@xmath12 coupling limit are not yet well - understood and therefore , in the recent time , has generated significant curiosity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the unconventional insulating state of the layered tetravalent iridates ( ir@xmath15 ; 5@xmath16 ) , designated as novel @xmath17 = @xmath18 mott insulators , have attracted much interest  @xcite , as metallic behavior is usually expected for partially filled broad @xmath19 bands in iridates . </S>",
    "<S> the insulating behavior is explained within single particle theories by assuming splitting of @xmath19 bands into a fully filled @xmath20  =  3/2 quartet bands and half filled narrow @xmath20  =  1/2 doublet bands due to finite soc , which further splits into a fully occupied lower hubbard and empty upper hubbard band in the presence of relatively small hubbard @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> another intriguing case would be a pentavalent iridium compound ( ir@xmath21 ; 5@xmath22 ) , where all the spin - orbit entangled electrons will be confined to the singlet @xmath1  =  0 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath13  =  0 ) state , without any resultant moment or magnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) where the energy levels of a low spin 5@xmath0 @xmath23 ir@xmath21 ion calculated as a function of spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath24  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite evolves from the @xmath10-@xmath11 coupling to the @xmath12-@xmath12 coupling regime  @xcite and a @xmath1  =  0 ground state is realized under strong soc ( see supplementary information ( si ) for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently there has been a theoretical suggestion of an excitonic magnetism ( transition from the @xmath1  =  0 to @xmath1  =  1 state ) in such systems  @xcite , due to comparable energy scales of the singlet - triplet splitting determined by soc and the super - exchange interaction promoted by hopping . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath25 ir compounds indeed fall into the category of the elusive @xmath12-@xmath12 coupled systems , experimentally a zero or vanishingly small magnetic moment should be observed for the otherwise nominal @xmath11  =  1 ir@xmath21 center and it would be interesting to know the nature of their magnetic response(s ) , if any </S>",
    "<S> . however , stabilization of such an unusual electronic state may be subtle as this @xmath1  =  0 ground state at moderate @xmath24 could be exceptionally fragile to minute external perturbation and enhanced magnetic responses may appear with rather small variations in magnetic fields or iro@xmath26 octahedral distortions giving rise to noncubic crystal field  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> possibly for this reason , there has been no experimental realization of this unusual state till date , other than a other than a speculation in the case of nairo@xmath2  @xcite , while another possible candidate sr@xmath3yiro@xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> double perovskite acquired long range magnetic order with comparatively larger paramagnetic moment of 0.91  @xmath27/ir ( ideal moment = 2.83  @xmath27 ) because of noncubic iro@xmath26 crystal field  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous attempts , we have explored the complex electronic and magnetic interplay of ir@xmath21 within a 6@xmath5 hexagonal compound , namely ba@xmath2znir@xmath3o@xmath4 ( space group : p6@xmath28/mmc ; see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) , where instead of the octahedral corner sharing of the iro@xmath26 units , the octahedra share face and form ir@xmath3o@xmath4 dimers . our experimental study </S>",
    "<S> indeed reveal that ba@xmath2znir@xmath3o@xmath4 probably comes closest to the coveted @xmath1  =  0 ground state with a low magnetic moment of individual ir atoms in the paramagnetic regime , indicating presence of rather strong @xmath24 , but not strong enough to completely arrest the hopping assisted excitonic magnetism at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , first principles density functional calculations indicate that the adjacent ir octahedra in a dimer prefers to be in a spin - orbital singlet ( sos ) state which should have eliminated any net magnetization from each ir@xmath3o@xmath4 dimeric unit provided this intradimer singlet interaction is strong enough . instead , sufficient interdimer hoppings are present in order to induce quantum fluctuations in the sos state and due to frustration arising from the triangular lattice structure in the @xmath29-plane ( lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) )  @xcite possibility of any long range order is prohibited . </S>",
    "<S> finally , detailed muon spin - rotation ( @xmath30sr ) and heat capacity measurements reveal the presence of strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures , and absence of any long range magnetic order down to 100  mk suggesting ba@xmath2znir@xmath3o@xmath4 to be a rare example of a quantum spin - orbital liquid ( qsol ) .    </S>",

    "<S> x - ray absorption spectra at the zn-@xmath32 and ir @xmath33-edges were collected at the elettra ( trieste , italy ) 11.1r - exafs beamline in standard transmission geometry at room temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the npd pattern ( with @xmath34 = 1.48  ; fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) recorded at room temperature has been refined with space group @xmath35 which revealed @xmath36 zn / ir site - disorder , _ i.e. _ face shared octahedral positions ( 4@xmath37 sites ) are almost exclusively occupied by ir forming ir@xmath3o@xmath4 dimer , while zn ions solely occupy the isolated octahedral sites ( 2@xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters obtained from the refinement of the 1.5k data have been listed in supplementary table i of si . </S>",
    "<S> however , the local cationic disorder and octahedral distortions in these compounds may pose a different picture  @xcite , and therefore xafs experiments were carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters , obtained from zn @xmath32- and ir @xmath33-xafs data analysis are summarized in table i. the xafs data analysis confirms negligible chemical disorder with ir ( zn ) ions mainly located at the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) sites with local interatomic distances being consistent with literature . </S>",
    "<S> the average ir - o distance is compatible with the average crystallographic ir - o distance ( 1.98  ) . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted that the @xmath41 is comparable with ( and even lower than ) the zn - o one , which suggests that zno@xmath26 and iro@xmath26 octahedra have similar distortions .    </S>",
    "<S> next , the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ( @xmath42 ) of bzio , measured by standard four probe method , is shown in the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insulating behavior can be modeled by variable range hopping mechanism in 2-dimension as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insulating behavior has been further tested by measurement of valence band photoemission experiment , where absence of any density of states at the fermi level ( see fig.2(b ) ) is confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> the xps spectra for the ir 4@xmath37 core level ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) can be fitted by spin - orbit split doublet with separation of 3.04 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the energy positions of 4@xmath43 and 4@xmath44 doublet confirm + 5 oxidation state of ir  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this intriguing insulating behavior of ir@xmath21 having four @xmath0-electrons in low spin configuration has been investigated within single particle mean - field framework by _ ab - initio _ density functional theory calculations by systematically including hubbard @xmath6 and soc . </S>",
    "<S> the non - spin polarized density of states ( dos ) of bzio within gga is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the system is metallic with the fermi level located at the @xmath19 manifold , comprising of twelve bands from four ir atoms in the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the octahedral crystal field is strong , resulting in quite large ( @xmath453.5 ev ) @xmath19 - @xmath46 crystal field splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the strong intradimer hoppings further lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath19 states . </S>",
    "<S> the dos is however remarkably different upon inclusion of soc and a hubbard @xmath6 ( @xmath6-@xmath1= 2.5 ev ) which makes the system insulating with a gap  10 mev ( see inset of fig 2(e ) ) . in the presence of soc </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 states ( six states including spin degeneracy ) break into a spin - orbit entangled set of states namely two - fold degenerate @xmath47 and a four - fold degenerate @xmath48 states . since four electrons are available per ir , all the @xmath48 states are occupied and the system is insulating as seen experimentally .    while analyzing the magnetic properties of ba@xmath28znir@xmath49o@xmath50 in the framework of gga+u+soc we find that local moments are spontaneously generated in the magnetic phase due to the hybridization between the occupied @xmath48 and empty @xmath47 states . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall argue that the superexchange between a pair of ir atoms within a dimer will promote a spin - orbital singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> the four @xmath48 orbitals are designated as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 while the two @xmath55 orbitals as @xmath56 , @xmath57 as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> we regard these states as pseudo - spin states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the state in which one electron occupying @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) will be considered as up ( down ) pseudo spin states . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that unlike @xmath19 orbitals the hopping between the pseudo spin states are not always pseudo spin conserved  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an electron in a pseudo spin state @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) can hop only to pseudo spin states @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) where @xmath62 and all other hoppings are pseudo spin conserved  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such hopping leads to antiferromagnetic pseudo spin interaction and thereby favors sos state as shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an antiferromagnetic configuration of pseudo spins in a dimer the @xmath48 electron in the state @xmath51 and @xmath52 can virtually hop to @xmath57 and @xmath56 respectively as this hopping is not pseudo - spin conserved ( indicated by @xmath63 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> once these electrons are promoted to the @xmath55 state , they can then gain energy by hopping to the other @xmath55 level as this hopping is now pseudo - spin conserved ( indicated by - in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) ) . the latter hopping is however not possible if the pseudo spins residing in the dimer were parallel . </S>",
    "<S> the same dimer however favors ferromagnetic interaction in the absence of spin - orbit interaction as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(g ) as the hopping between the @xmath19 orbitals are spin conserved . </S>",
    "<S> in order to check the above mentioned scenarios we have carried out spin polarized gga+u and gga+u+soc calculations for several magnetic configurations ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gga+@xmath6+soc calculations reveal a rather large spin moment ( 0.65 - 0.75 @xmath30b ) per ir atom . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the large value of the orbital moment ( 0.26 @xmath30b ) confirms the importance of spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> also , the magnetic configuration with antiferromagnetic intradimer coupling is found to be energetically favorable only in the presence of soc , emphasizing its importance in the realization of sos states in bzio . </S>",
    "<S> although , an estimate of symmetric exchange interactions suggest appreciable intradimer exchange ( @xmath64 = -14.6 mev ) , there is substantial interdimer exchange too ( @xmath65 = -1.5 mev with 6 neighbors in the @xmath66 plane ) and ( @xmath67 = -1.6 mev with 3 neighbors perpendicular to the @xmath66 plane ) . therefore , the intradimer interactions are not strong enough compared to the interdimer interactions leading to a frustrated behavior instead of a sos - like long - range state .    in order to check whether the soc driven soss in bzio </S>",
    "<S> eventually lead to long range magnetic order , we have carried out npd experiments at lower temperature too . </S>",
    "<S> the high resolution npd pattern recorded at 2  k has been shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> all peaks of the observed pattern have been refined with @xmath35 space group without any significant magnetic contribution , indicating absence of any long range magnetic order in the system at least down to 2  k. these npd results also rule out the possibility of any structural transition below 300  k. however , in presence of strong soc and frustration , a clear long range magnetic order might be missingabsent while local magnetic interactions are still significant . therefore , in order to unravel the nature of the ground state stabilized in this compound we performed muon spin relaxation experiments in zero field , a technique perfectly suited to detect weak and/or partial freezing of local magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the muon polarization in the sample is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> at high temperature , the slow gaussian like relaxation arises from nuclear dipoles which are static in the @xmath30sr time window and give a @xmath68 independent contribution . upon lowering temperature , the relaxation rate increases gradually from about 100  k as a result of the slowing down of the electronic fluctuations and strikingly levels off below about 2  k as demonstrated by the nearly perfect overlap of the 2  k and 0.1  k polarization curves . despite this obvious slowing down of the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we did not observe any spontaneous oscillations or emergence of a  </S>",
    "<S> 1/3rd \" tail that would signal a magnetic transition to a frozen state . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the relaxation to the application of a longitudinal field at base temperature also supports its dynamical origin ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it can be concluded that the system does not order down to 0.1  k at least .    in the low temperature regime , below about 35k , the signal appears clearly to be composed of at least 3 components ; one fast relaxing , one with a moderate relaxation rate and one hardly relaxing . </S>",
    "<S> these three components likely reflect three different muon stopping sites in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we fitted the data to the model ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the kubo - toyabe function  @xcite accounting for the static nuclear field distribution of width @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the fractions of the two more relaxing components and @xmath74 is the dynamical relaxation function introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 19    to account for the effect of a fluctuating field distribution of width @xmath71 at a rate @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the fits with respect to this model are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) where only the fluctuation rate @xmath75 was allowed to vary with temperature and the extracted values are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other @xmath68 independent parameters were refined to @xmath76 , @xmath77 . at the lowest measured temperatures , when the fluctuations are the slowest we note that for both relaxing components the inequality @xmath78 where @xmath79  =  2@xmath80  x  135.5 mrad / s / t is the muon gyromagnetic ratio , still holds since @xmath81  =  12.5@xmath30s@xmath82 and @xmath83  =  3.4@xmath30s@xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this validates the use of dynamical relaxation functions , in line with the absence of the usual evidence for a frozen ground state .    the above prediction of a special qsol state in bzio is further confirmed by the analysis of heat capacity ( @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature variation of c ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) ) does not show any peak or anomaly , consistent with the absence of any structural and/or long range magnetic transition . in order to extract the magnetic heat capacity @xmath85 by subtracting the lattice contribution , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 was also measured for an isostructural nonmagnetic compound ba@xmath2znsb@xmath3o@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of molecular weight between these two compounds for subtracting the lattice part has been taken into account following the scaling procedure , developed by bouvier _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 obtained from such analysis has been plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) , which shows only a broad peak around @xmath4515 k followed by a decay around 30  k without any further anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> a fit of the magnetic heat capacity ( @xmath85=@xmath86 ) from 3k to 9k gives a significant @xmath68-linear contribution of @xmath79  =  25.9 mj / mol-@xmath87 unusual for insulating systems . </S>",
    "<S> also , the finite @xmath79 value does not change with application of external magnetic field as high as 9 tesla , suggesting its origin to be gapless excitations from spinon density of qsol state or minor lattice oxygen vacancies and not any paramagnetic impurity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mixed temperature dependence is observed in other spin liquid systems , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ ba@xmath2cusb@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath11  =  1/2 )  @xcite , 3c phase of ba@xmath2nisb@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath11  =  1 )  @xcite , niga@xmath3s@xmath88 ( @xmath11  =  1 )  @xcite , ba@xmath2irti@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath89 )  @xcite _ etc . _ </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic entropy obtained by integrating @xmath85/@xmath68 with @xmath68 has been shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) , which is much smaller ( @xmath457% ) compared to the value for spin only magnetic entropy , rln(2@xmath11 + 1 ) with @xmath11  =  1 and unlike other spin liquid candidates containing 3@xmath0 tm , where the entropy change is more than 30 - 50% of the total magnetic entropy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value is in fact close to 0 as expected for a spin - orbit coupled magnetic entropy , rln(2@xmath1 + 1 ) with @xmath1  =  0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the heat capacity study does confirm presence of qsol - like dynamical ground state in this system , visible below 30  k. it also indicates towards the fact that the magnetic ground state and the moment in bzio are only ` byproducts ' of certain spin excitations from otherwise nonmagnetic , singlet ir@xmath21 @xmath1  =  0 state , since the small magnetic entropy is likely released due to such weak magnetic crossover  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the temperature dependence of field - cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) magnetization measured with 5000  oe field in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly there is no indication of a magnetic order in this case , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath90 vs. @xmath68 curves are fit with a function , @xmath91 + @xmath92/(@xmath68 - @xmath93 ) where @xmath91 is the temperature independent paramagnetic susceptibility , @xmath92 and @xmath93 represent curie constant and curie - weiss temperature , respectively , and the result is shown as a green straight line , laid on the 1/(@xmath90-@xmath91 ) vs. @xmath68 data . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting , especially at the higher temperature region , extracts a @xmath93 value @xmath45 - 30 k and a moment of @xmath450.2  @xmath27/ir . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the magnetic frustration parameter , defined as the ratio of @xmath93  =  -30  k to the upper limit of the magnetic ordering temperature that we could probe , going upto at least 300 proves that the system indeed behaves like a quantum spin - orbital liquid .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our detailed analysis reveal bzio is a @xmath94 insulator , where the origin of the small but finite nonzero moment is due to super - exchange induced spin excitations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these ir moments within the ir@xmath3o@xmath4 dimer interact antiferromagnetically resulting in spin - orbital singlets . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - dimer hoppings in the @xmath29-plane induce quantum fluctuations in these singlets and a long range magnetic order is arrested due to geometric frustration , arising from the triangular lattice structure in the @xmath29-plane resulting in a quantum spin - orbital liquid state , confirmed both by @xmath30sr and heat capacity studies . </S>"
