    "after an initial brightening lasting @xmath41.5 days , the optical transient ( ot ) of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 970508 faded with a nearly pure power - law slope by 5 magnitudes over @xmath4100 days ( eg .  galama et al .  1998 ; garcia et al .",
    "1998 ; sokolov et al .  1998 ) .",
    "indications of a flattening in the light - curve ( pedersen et al .",
    "1997 ) were confirmed independently by bloom et al .",
    "1998 , castro - tirado et al .",
    "1998 , and sokolov et al .  1998 .",
    "the existence of an [ o ii ] emission line at the absorption system redshift ( metzger et al .",
    "1997b ) was taken as evidence for an underlying , dim galaxy host .",
    "after hst images revealed the point - source nature of the light , fruchter , bergeron , & pian  1997 , pian et al .",
    "1998 , and natarajan et al .",
    "1997 suggested that the source responsible for the emission must be a very faint ( @xmath5 mag ) , compact ( @xmath6 arcsec ) dwarf galaxy at @xmath7 nearly coincident on the sky with the transient .",
    "these predictions are largely confirmed in the present study .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on the results of deep imaging and spectroscopy of the host galaxy of grb 970508 obtained at the 10-m keck ii telescope .",
    "imaging and spectroscopic observations were obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10-m keck ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the log of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "all nights were photometric .",
    "the imaging data were reduced in the standard manner .    to follow the light - curve behavior of the ot+host over @xmath4300 days from the time of the burst , we chose to tie the photometric zero - point to a previous study ( sokolov et al .",
    "1998 ) which predicted late - time magnitudes based on early ( @xmath8 days ) power - law behavior in several bandpasses .",
    "this provides an internally consistent data set for our purposes .",
    "other studies of the light - curve include galama et al .",
    "1998 and pian et al .  1998 .",
    "v.  sokolov ( private communication ) provided magnitudes of eight `` tertiary '' field stars ( @xmath9 = 18.7 to 23 mag ) as reference since the four secondary comparison stars ( sokolov et al .",
    "1998 ) were saturated in all our images .",
    "the zero - points were determined through a least squares fit and have conservative errors @xmath10 and @xmath11 mag .    for our spectroscopic observations we used a 300 grating which gives a typical resolution of @xmath12  , and a wavelength range from approximately 3900 to 8900  .",
    "the spectroscopic standards g191b2b ( massey et al .  1988 ) and hd 19445 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) were used to flux calibrate the data of october and november , respectively .",
    "spectra were obtained with the slit position angle at @xmath13 , in order to observe both the host galaxy of grb 970519 , and g1 .",
    "this angle was always close to the parallactic angle , and the wavelength - dependent slit losses are not important for the discussion below .",
    "internal consistency implied by measurements of independent standards implies an uncertainty of less than 20% in the flux zero point calibration",
    ". exposures of arc lamps were used for the wavelength calibration , with a resulting r.m.s .",
    "uncertainty of about 0.3  , and possible systematic errors of the same order , due to the instrument flexure .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of the derived magnitudes at the position of the ot and , as a comparison , the predicted magnitude from a pure - power law decay fit by sokolov et al .",
    "the ot+host is brighter by @xmath14 magnitudes in both @xmath15- and @xmath9-band leading to the obvious conclusion that transient has faded to reveal a constant source .",
    "we used a levenberg - marquardt @xmath16-square minimization method to fit a power law flux ( ot ) plus constant flux ( galaxy ) to the @xmath15 and @xmath9 light - curves using data compiled in sokolov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time since the burst measured in days .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the normalization of the flux of the transient and the persistent flux of the underlying galaxy , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath21 mag ,  @xmath22 mag , @xmath23 mag , @xmath24 mag , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the data are statistically inconsistent with a pure power - law decline .",
    "to search for any potential offset of the ot and the galaxy , we used an early image of the grb field obtained on cosmic at the palomar 200-inch telescope on may 13.6 1997 ut while the transient was still bright ( @xmath9 @xmath27 20 mag ; see djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming the power - law behavior continued , the light at the transient position is now dominated by the galaxy , with the transient contributing less than 30% to the total flux ( see figure [ fig : ltcurve ] ) .",
    "we registered the keck lris and the p200 cosmic @xmath9-band ( 300-s ) images , by matching 33 relatively bright ( @xmath28 mag ) objects in a 4@xmath29 4  field surrounding the grb transient .",
    "the coordinate transformation between the two images accounted for pixel scale , rotating , translation , and higher - order distortion .",
    "the r.m.s .  of the transformed star positions ( including both axes ) was @xmath30 lris pixels (= 0.121 arcsec ) .",
    "we find the angular separation of the ot and the galaxy to be @xmath31 pixels (= 0.175 arcsec ) , which includes the error of the transformation and centering errors of the objects themselves .",
    "the galaxy is found well - within 1.7 pixels = 0.37 arcsec ( 3-@xmath32 ) of the ot .",
    "the averaged spectrum of the ot shows a very blue continuum , a prominent emission line at @xmath33  , and a somewhat weaker line at @xmath34 (fig .",
    "[ fig : thespect ] ) .",
    "we interpret the emission features as [ o ii ] 3727   and [ ne iii ] 3869   at the weighted mean redshift of @xmath35 .",
    "our inferred redshift for the host is consistent ( within errors ) with that of the absorbing system discovered by metzger et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the spectrum of the nearby galaxy g1 shows a relatively featureless , blue continuum .",
    "we are unable to determine its redshift at this stage .",
    "our spectroscopic measurements give a magnitude @xmath36 mag ( ot+host ) at the mean epoch ( @xmath37 days after the grb ) of our observations , in excellent agreement with the magnitude inferred from the fit to direct imaging data ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "after an initial brightening , the light - curve of the optical transient did not deviate significantly from a power - law over first 100 days after the burst ( see also eg .",
    "galama et al .",
    "1998 ; garcia et al .  1998 ) . assuming the blastwave producing the afterglow expanded relativistically ( bulk lorentz factor , @xmath38 few ) during the beginning of the light - curve decline ,",
    "the observed flux was produced from within an angle @xmath39 of the emitting surface . as the blastwave expands , @xmath40 increases with time . as long as the angle through which the blastwave is",
    "collimated is greater than @xmath40 , there would be no obvious break in the light - curve ( eg .",
    "sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "one might expect , in addition , the blastwave to eventually become sub - relativistic resulting not only in a larger observed surface area , but perhaps a change in surface emmisivity .",
    "curiously , an apparent break expected in either scenario did not materialize .",
    "the spatial coincidence of the transient and the underlying galaxy may simply be a chance projection of the transient , which lies beyond @xmath7 , and the galaxy at @xmath7 .",
    "the surface density of galaxies down to @xmath41 mag is 48.3 per arcmin@xmath42 .",
    "it is important to note that we know _ a priori _ that the host must lie in the redshift range @xmath43 ( metzger et al .",
    "the fraction of galaxies within this range is @xmath44 percent of the total at the magnitude level ( roche et al .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ poisson probability of finding such a galaxy with in 0.37 arcsec from the ot is 3 @xmath29 10@xmath45 .",
    "keeping in mind the limitations of _ a posteriori _ statistics , this small probability and the trend that grb transients appear to be nearly spatially coincident with galaxies lead us to suggest this galaxy is the host of grb 970508 .    assuming a standard friedman model cosmology with @xmath46 km s@xmath47 mpc@xmath47 and @xmath48 we derive a luminosity distance of @xmath49 cm to the host galaxy . the observed equivalent width in",
    "the [ o ii ] line is @xmath50  , or about 63   in the galaxy s restframe .",
    "however , this also includes the continuum light from the ot at this epoch . correcting for the ot contribution",
    "would then double these values of the equivalent width .",
    "this is at the high end of the distribution for the typical field galaxies at comparable magnitudes and redshifts ( hogg et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the implied [ o ii ] line luminosity , corrected for the extinction , is @xmath51 erg s@xmath47 . using the relation from kennicutt ( 1998 ) we estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath52 .",
    "an alternative estimate of the sfr can be obtained from the continuum luminosity at @xmath53   ( madau , pozzetti , & dickinson  1998 ) .",
    "the observed , interpolated continuum flux from the host itself ( i.e. , not including the ot light ) at the corresponding @xmath54 , is @xmath55jy , corrected for the estimated galactic extinction ( @xmath56 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) . for our assumed cosmology ,",
    "the restframe continuum luminosity is then @xmath57 erg s@xmath47 hz@xmath47 , corresponding to sfr @xmath58 .",
    "this is notably lower than the sfr inferred from the [ o ii ] line .",
    "we note , however , that neither is known to be a very reliable sfr indicator .",
    "both are also subject to the unknown extinction corrections from the galaxy s own ism ( the continuum estimate being more sensitive ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the _ lower limit _ to the sfr in this galaxy is probably about 0.5 to 1 @xmath59 .",
    "the observed flux in the [ ne iii ] 3869   line is @xmath60 erg @xmath61 s@xmath47 , not corrected for the extinction .",
    "the flux ratio of the two emission lines is @xmath62 .",
    "this ratio is about 10 times higher than the typical values for h ii regions .",
    "nonetheless , it is in the range of photoionization models for h ii regions by stasinska ( 1990 ) , for different combinations of model parameters , but generally for effective temperatures @xmath63 k.    the inferred host luminosity is in agreement with the upper limit from earlier _ hst _ observations ( pian et al .",
    "further , our derived @xmath15- and @xmath9-magnitudes for the galaxy correspond to a continuum with a power law @xmath64 .",
    "extrapolating from the observed @xmath9-band flux to the wavelength corresponding to the restframe @xmath15-band ( about 8060  ) , and correcting for the galactic foreground extinction , we derive the observed flux @xmath65jy . for our assumed cosmology ,",
    "the implied restframe absolute magnitude is then @xmath66 .",
    "thus the restframe @xmath15-band luminosity of the host galaxy is about @xmath67 today .",
    "this galaxy is roughly 2 magnitudes fainter than the knee of the observed luminosity function of all galaxies between redshift @xmath68 and 1.0 ( canada - france redshift survey ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) and one magnitude fainter than late - time , star - forming galaxies in the 2df survey ( colless 1998 ) .",
    "the specific sfr per unit luminosity is high .",
    "this object can thus be characterized as an actively star - forming dwarf galaxy .",
    "objects of this type are fairly common at comparable redshifts .",
    "the high effective temperature implied by the relative line strengths of [ ne iii ] and [ o ii ] , suggests the presence of a substantial population of massive stars and thus , active and recent star formation .",
    "this , in turn , gives additional support to the ideas that the origin of grbs is related to massive stars ( e.g.  wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; totani 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility for the origin of the [ ne iii ] 3869 line is photoionization by a low - luminosity agn .",
    "while we can not exclude this possibility , we note that there is no other evidence in favor of this hypothesis , and moreover we see no other emission lines , e.g. , mg ii 2799  , which would be expected with comparable strengths in an agn - powered object .",
    "what may be surprising , in the neutron star binary ( ns  ns ) model of grb progenitors ( eg .  narayan , paczyski , & piran 1992 ; paczyski 1986 ) , is that grb 970508 appears so close ( @xmath69 kpc ) to a dwarf galaxy ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "bloom , sigurdsson , & pols ( 1998 ) recently found that less than 15 percent of ns ",
    "ns binaries will merge within 3 kpc of a comparable under - massive galaxy .",
    "if grbs are consistently found very near ( @xmath71 few kpc ) of their purported host , then progenitor models such as microquasars ( paczyski 1998 ) , `` failed '' type ib supernovae ( woosley 1993 ) , or black hole  neutron star binaries ( mochkovitch et al .",
    "1993 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) , all of which are expected to produce grbs more tightly bound to their hosts , would be favored .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank s.  odewahn , m.  van kerkwijk , r.  gal , and a.  ramaprakrash for assistance during observing runs at keck , p.  groot for comments , and r.  sari for helpful discussions concerning inferences from the light - curve .",
