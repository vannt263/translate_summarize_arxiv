    "a directed current ( dc ) is usually associated to a dissipative flow of the electrons in response to an applied bias voltage . however , in systems of mesoscopic scale a dc current can be generated even at _ zero _ bias .",
    "this captivating quantum coherent effect is called _ quantum charge pumping _ @xcite and it is of considerable interest both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . a device capable of providing such effect",
    "is called a _ quantum pump _ and typically involves the cyclic change of two device - control parameters with a frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the operational regime of the pump can be characterized according to the relative magnitude between @xmath2 and the inverse of the time taken for an electron to traverse the sample , @xmath3 . when @xmath4 the pump is in the so called  _  adiabatic _  regime , whereas the opposite case , @xmath5 , the pump is in the _",
    "`` non - adiabatic '' _ regime .",
    "for adiabatic pumping , brouwer @xcite gave an appealing approach which is based on a scattering matrix formulation to low frequency ac transport due to bttiker , thomas and prtre @xcite .",
    "in this formulation , the pumped current which flows in response to a the cyclic variation of a set @xmath6 of device - control parameters is expressed in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath7 of the system .",
    "one of the outcomes of this parametric pumping theory , which is valid in the low frequency regime ( @xmath4 ) and up to first order in frequency , is that the charge pumped during a cycle is proportional to the area enclosed by the path in the scattering matrix parameter space .",
    "thus , to have a non - vanishing pumped charge at least _ two _ time - dependent parameters that oscillate with a frequency @xmath2 and with a non - vanishing phase difference @xmath8 between them are needed .    in this context , a natural question that arises",
    "is whether a pumped current can be obtained using a _ single _ time - dependent parameter . in",
    "most of the works considered up to now , at least _ two _ parameters are used to obtain pumping .",
    "a typical configuration that has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite consists of a dot connected to two leads with two out of phase time - dependent gate voltages that produce cyclic changes in its shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - schemes]a ) .",
    "in contrast , pumps based on a _ single _ parameter variation have attracted much less attention .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that no pumping can be obtained from them in the low frequency regime up to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "hence , obtaining a non - trivial result requires to go beyond the adiabatic limit described by the standard parametric pumping theory @xcite as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in spite of giving a current which at low frequencies is _ a priori _ weaker than the one obtained using a two - parameter variation",
    ", they can give comparable pumped currents at intermediate and high frequencies @xcite .",
    "besides , the understanding of such `` mono - parametric pumps '' constitute a necessary step in the comprehension of driven systems .",
    "previous theoretical studies in this direction include the works by kravtsov , yudson and aronov @xcite where pumping in a ring ( not connected to leads ) threaded by a time - dependent flux was studied . in ref .",
    "@xcite guo and collaborators considered the case in which the height of one of the barriers of a double barrier system connected to external leads is modulated periodically .",
    "this modulation _ dynamically _ breaks the inversion symmetry of the system producing a pumped current .",
    "other theoretical works aiming at the frequency dependence of the pumped current for situations beyond the adiabatic approximation were also reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental studies using a single parameter modulation have been reported recently @xcite showing predominant rectification effects @xcite at low frequencies and quantum pumping in the high frequency regime .    in this work we focus in mono - parametric",
    "pumping in systems connected to external leads .",
    "specifically , we study a quantum pump consisting of a ring with a dot which is subjected to a _ single _ time - periodic gate voltage embedded in one of its arms as represented in fig.[fig - schemes]b @xcite",
    ". the ring is threaded by a _ static _ magnetic field which produces the left - right symmetry breaking needed for pumping .",
    "the unique role of the time - dependent parameter in this pump is to provide for photon - assisted channels .",
    "we show that in the low frequency regime ( @xmath4 ) as a result of the interplay between spatial interference through the ring and photon - assisted processes , this device produces a dc current which is proportional to @xmath9 and whose direction can be reversed by tuning the applied magnetic field .",
    "our theoretical framework mostly follows ref .",
    "@xcite and is based on the use of floquet s theory @xcite to write the average current in terms of the fourier components of the retarded green s functions for the system . however , instead of solving an eigenvalue problem as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we completely rely on the computation of the floquet - green s functions for the system .",
    "the resulting picture is that of an equivalent time - independent problem in a higher dimensional space ( similar to the one previously obtained for electron - phonon interactions @xcite ) and is specially suited for discrete hamiltonians offering thus a promising application to molecular systems @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly introduce our theoretical tools and present the case of a driven double barrier as an example to motivate the subsequent discussion of mono - parametric quantum pumping",
    ". then we focus in our model system , discussing our analytical and numerical results .",
    "in this section we introduce the theoretical tools that will be used to address our specific problem . in order to keep the discussion general we consider at this point a generic system consisting of a sample region that is connected to two leads ( left and right ) .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian can be written in the form:@xmath10 where the terms correspond to the contributions from the sample , the leads and the sample - leads coupling respectively .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we focus on the regime of quantum coherent transport and electron - electron interactions are not considered .",
    "we consider a situation in which both leads are in thermal equilibrium with a common chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath11for all energies .",
    "then , the current averaged over one period of the modulation is given by @xcite : @xmath12 f(\\varepsilon ) \\label{eq - averagecurrent}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are the transmission probabilities for an electron with energy @xmath14 from left to right involving the absorption ( or emission ) of an energy @xmath15(and similarly for @xmath16 ) .",
    "here @xmath17 are the coefficients of the fourier decomposition of the retarded green s function @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are given by the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy correction due to the corresponding lead , @xmath20 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - averagecurrent ] ) was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by solving the heisenberg equations of motion for the creation and annihilation operators and taking advantage of the time - periodicity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the transmission probabilities @xmath21 were expressed in terms of the fourier components @xmath22 of the retarded green s functions .",
    "this procedure is , for non - interacting electrons , formally equivalent to the use of the keldysh formalism @xcite but in contrast with previous works along that path , the time - periodicity of the hamiltonian is exploited through the use of floquet s theory @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the fourier components @xmath22 of the retarded green s functions were written ( after tracing over the degrees of freedom in the leads ) in terms of the solutions of floquet s equation @xcite for the sample region .",
    "while the floquet s states and their corresponding quasi - energies can be obtained numerically , this can take a significant computational power depending on the system size . here , we use instead a different strategy : the essential idea is to write eq .",
    "( [ eq - averagecurrent ] ) completely in terms of the floquet - green s functions .",
    "to such end we note that the fourier coefficients @xmath23 can be written as ( see appendix):@xmath24 where the floquet - green s functions @xmath25 are defined in terms of the floquet hamiltonian : @xmath26 notice that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined in the composed hilbert space @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the space of functions in real space and @xmath31 is the space of periodic functions with period @xmath32.@xmath33the space @xmath31 is spanned by the set of orthonormal fourier vectors @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer . a suitable basis for this so called _ floquet or sambe space _",
    "@xcite , @xmath29 , is thus given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 corresponds to a state localized at site @xmath38 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq - fouriercomponents - floquetgf ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - t_n ] ) and ( [ eq - averagecurrent ] ) we write the average current completely in terms of the floquet - green s functions @xmath28 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the key point here is that this renders an equivalent time - independent problem in a higher dimensional space , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the full power of the recursive green s functions techniques @xcite can be used accordingly .    to compute these functions",
    "we consider only the floquet states @xmath39 within some range for @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "this range can be successively expanded until the answer converges , giving thus a variational ( non - perturbative ) method .",
    "the resulting scheme is similar to the one introduced in refs.@xcite for the problem of phonon - assisted electron transport @xcite .",
    "the main differences @xcite are that : _ a ) _ for phonons the temperature enters naturally in the population of the different channels , _ b ) _ that the phonon spectrum is bounded from below and _ c ) _ , that the matrix element for phonon emission and absorption depend on the number @xmath41 of phonons present in the system before the scattering process . in order to fix ideas and to motivate the subsequent discussion ,",
    "let us see how this picture works for the case of a driven double barrier and then we turn into the study of our model system .",
    "let us consider a system as depicted in the top of fig .",
    "[ fig - models]a .",
    "a simple hamiltonian for that situation is given by:@xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are the creation ( destruction ) operators at site @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the energies of the barrier sites which are modulated periodically .",
    "only one energy state @xmath48 inside the double barrier is considered .",
    "the leads are regarded as one - dimensional tight - binding chains which are coupled to the sites @xmath49 and @xmath30 in the sample as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - models]a .",
    "in floquet space and lines are off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "states along a vertical line correspond to the same spatial states with different number @xmath35 of  photon quanta .",
    "note that the phase of the vertical matrix elements connecting different floquet states generally depend on the direction of the transition .",
    "for example , the matrix element of the floquet hamiltonian connecting the @xmath50 state with @xmath51 is @xmath52 while the matrix element for the reverse process is @xmath53 .",
    "b ) representation of the model hamiltonian used in the text for the situation in fig .",
    "width=264 ]    the floquet hamiltonian ( see eq.([eq - floquet hamiltonian ] ) ) for this system in the composed space @xmath29  is represented in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig - models]a .",
    "the horizontal dimension corresponds to states localized in different spatial positions @xmath54  while the vertical one corresponds to different fourier states @xmath55 .",
    "lines along the horizontal direction correspond to hoppings between states localized in different positions while the vertical ones are determined by the fourier coefficients of the time - dependent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we can clearly see that the resulting picture is that of a higher dimensional time - independent system .",
    "the transport properties can be computed directly from the green s functions in this space as discussed before .    using this picture",
    "we can now try to understand the main difference between a one - parameter and a two - parameter pump .",
    "symmetry breaking is at the heart of quantum charge pumping : to obtain a directed current at zero bias potential , the left - right symmetry ( lrs ) of the system must be broken",
    ". this can be achieved by breaking either time reversal symmetry ( trs ) or inversion symmetry ( is ) . however , breaking of the lrs alone does not guarantee a non - vanishing pumped current . in a two terminal configuration for example",
    "even when these symmetries are statically broken ( i.e. through a time - independent potential ) , trs under magnetic field inversion and unitarity of the scattering matrix assures that the transmittance is insensitive to the direction of propagation @xcite , i.e. @xmath56 , and hence there is no pumped current .",
    "when a time - dependent potential is added , photon - assisted processes come into play opening new paths for transport .",
    "the resulting picture is that of a multichannel system and the reciprocity relation @xmath57 valid for the static case is replaced by an integral relation , @xmath58 , thus allowing for a non - vanishing pumping current .",
    "the crucial difference between the situation where only one time - dependent parameter is present and the one with two , is the possibility of making a closed loop in floquet space involving at least two  vertical processes ( or two `` paths '' in floquet space ) .",
    "when the two - parameter variation is out of phase @xmath59 , _ there will be a non - vanishing accumulated phase through the loop in a way which is analogous to a magnetic flux .",
    "_ for @xmath60 the accumulated phase is different depending on the direction of motion .",
    "note that this directional asymmetry of the electronic motion ( which is a consequence of a dynamical breaking of is  and trs ) is maximum when @xmath61 .",
    "we will see that for a system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - schemes]b , where only one time - dependent gate voltage is present , the directional asymmetry is provided by the static magnetic field and is manifested as a pumped current only when photon - assisted processes are allowed .",
    "in what follows we focus in a system as depicted in fig . [",
    "fig - schemes]b , consisting of a quantum dot embedded in an arm of a ring which in turn is connected to two leads ( the dot is placed symmetrically between the leads ) .",
    "the ring is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath62 .",
    "we do not consider the electron - electron interaction in the dot which is a reasonable approximation for strong dot - ring coupling ( open dot ) .",
    "we demonstrate our results using a lattice hamiltonian similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "while we use the simplest model with this geometry , i.e. a four sites ring , our results can be extended to more general situations involving for example several sites in each arm of the ring and arbitrary potential profile .",
    "our hamiltonian is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - models]b .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath62 is introduced as a phase factor in @xmath63 ( note that gauge invariance allows to place it on any bond of the ring ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the labels used for the site in the reference arm of the ring and the dot respectively .",
    "the energy of the state in the dot @xmath66 which is modulated periodically by a gate voltage is modeled through @xmath67 .",
    "the leads are modeled as one - dimensional tight - binding chains with zero site energy and hopping matrix element @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "now we turn into the study of the pumping properties of our system .",
    "first we write the kernel in eq.([eq - averagecurrent ] ) as a sum of contributions due to the different channels:@xmath70   \\equiv\\sum_{n}\\delta t_{{}}^{(n)}(\\varepsilon ) \\equiv\\delta t(\\varepsilon),\\ ] ] where@xmath71    to gain an understanding of the physical mechanisms that give rise to pumping in our system we compute the floquet - green s functions up to the first non - vanishing order in the driving amplitude . using dyson s equation for the floquet - green s functions we obtain for the elastic component : @xmath72 and similarly for @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 are the exact retarded green s functions for the system in the absence of the time - dependent potential .",
    "the superscripts are a short notation to indicate that the corresponding green s functions are evaluated at a displaced energy , @xmath75 , all the other functions are evaluated at the energy @xmath14 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq - approxg_f_elastic ] ) we can appreciate that the elastic component of the floquet - green s function connecting the left and right electrodes is the sum of two terms : one that corresponds to direct transmission from left to right and other that involves virtual photon emission and absorption in the dot .",
    "thus , the modulus squared of @xmath76 , contains three terms : _ a ) _",
    "@xmath77 , which  is @xmath78 independent and does not contribute to the pumped current because it obeys the symmetry @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "_ b ) _ the next contribution is the modulus squared of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - approxg_f_elastic ] ) which is fourth order in the driving amplitude and can be neglected in a first approximation . _",
    "c ) _ the last contribution is an interference term between the quantum mechanical amplitudes corresponding to direct tunneling and tunneling plus virtual photon emission and absorption .",
    "this term , which critically depends on the phase difference between the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq - approxg_f_elastic ] ) , has a directional asymmetry due to the presence of the magnetic field which gives rise to a non - vanishing contribution to the pumped current .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected in the fact that @xmath80 for @xmath81 . to understand this difference it is useful to note that @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 )  is proportional to the effective hopping between the corresponding sites , namely @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 , being the proportionality constant the same for both cases ) .",
    "this effective hopping can be written as a sum of two terms , a direct one from site @xmath49 to the dot and other that corresponds to the alternative path through the ring : @xmath86 ( a similar expression holds for@xmath87 ) , where @xmath88 is the green s function of the isolated @xmath64 site renormalized by the presence of the @xmath30 site and the right lead , @xmath89 is the green s function of the isolated right site renormalized by the right lead .",
    "it is easy to see that the interference between these two spatial paths is directionally asymmetric for @xmath90 giving therefore @xmath91 @xmath92 ) but this time the interference takes place in real space .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed based on the study of the floquet - green s functions involving a net photon absorption and emission:@xmath93 again the main observation is that the pumped current is originated from spatial interference through the ring plus the photon - assisted processes provided by the time - dependent variation of the dot s energy .    in order to obtain the frequency dependence of the pumped current we assume the validity of the broad - band approximation and expand the green s functions @xmath94 for low frequencies . using this expansion in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - approxg_f_elastic ] ) and ( [ eq - approxgfinelastic ] ) it can be seen that the overall frequency independent contribution to @xmath95 is zero and results from a cancellation between the elastic and the inelastic contributions .",
    "the contributions to @xmath96 that are first order in @xmath97 cancel with the corresponding ones in @xmath98 .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq - approxg_f_elastic ] ) shows that the linear term in @xmath99 also vanishes as a consequence of the symmetry between the sidebands of absorption and emission @xcite .",
    "hence , we observe that the first non - vanishing contribution to the average current @xmath100 is proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "it must be noted that the predicted frequency dependence of the pumped current @xmath100 is in consistency with the general results presented in refs . @xcite for different systems .",
    "here , we interpret our results within the framework introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : the charge pumped per cycle is determined not by the contour in parameter space as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which in this case encloses a vanishing area ) but by the contour in _ phase space _ @xcite which contains in addition to the pumping parameters their time - derivatives .",
    "the contour in phase space encompasses a non - vanishing area which is proportional to @xmath2 , giving thus the predicted quadratic frequency dependence for the pumped current @xmath102 .",
    "the results obtained up to now are very general in the sense that they do not depend much on the specifics of the model as long as the geometry is preserved .",

    "the regions with larger @xmath111 values correspond to darker areas .",
    "we observe that the larger currents are located for energies close to the energy of the dot s level ( @xmath112 ) and small magnetic flux ( @xmath113 ) . as the magnetic flux increases from zero to half flux quantum , the position of these maxima move due to interference inside the ring . at @xmath114 the trs of the system",
