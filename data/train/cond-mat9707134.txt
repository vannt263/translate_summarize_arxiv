    "an important group of dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are lead salts in which a fraction of the pb ions have been replaced by eu ions.@xcite pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te is one member of this group .",

    "the eu@xmath10 ion , with 7 electrons in the half - filled 4@xmath11 shell , has zero orbital angular momentum and total spin s=7/2 .",
    "epr data show that in pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te @xmath12 and that the spin hamiltonian for the eu@xmath10 ion contains a very small crystal - field anisotropy.@xcite    it has been known for several years that the eu  eu exchange interaction in these iv ",
    "vi dms is two orders of magnitude smaller than the mn ",

    "mn exchange constant .",
    "much of the early information concerning these eu  eu exchange interactions came from measurements of the curie - weiss temperature @xmath15 , and from analysis of high - field magnetization data at @xmath16  k.@xcite as discussed later , both of these methods yield only a rough estimate of the dominant af exchange constant @xmath4 . in the present paper we present an accurate determination of @xmath4 in pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te using the magnetization - steps ( msts ) method.@xcite",
    "because @xmath17 is of order 0.1  k , the observation of the msts required the use of a dilution refrigerator operating well below 0.1 k.    in addition to yielding @xmath4 , the low - temperature magnetization data also gave information about the distribution of the eu ions over the cation sites .",
    "such information is not readily available by other means .",
    "the analysis indicates that the distribution is not perfectly random ( equal probability of occupation of all cation sites in the crystal ) . instead",
    ", the eu ions tend to bunch together .",
    "another important issue is whether the dominant af exchange constant @xmath4 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) or to the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchange constant , @xmath5 or @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this issue is addressed on the basis of the results for the eu spatial distribution .",
    "much of the relevant theory was discussed in a recent paper on the msts in pb@xmath0eu@xmath9se.@xcite we refer the reader to this earlier paper , and confine ourselves here to a summary of the main points .",
    "some newer theoretical results are also mentioned .    as a first approximation we consider a simple model which captures the main features of the experimental data . in this `` single-@xmath4 '' model for a dms , only one af exchange constant @xmath4",
    "is included .",
    "other exchange constants , and all anisotropies , are neglected . in this model",
    "each eu ion on the fcc sublattice belongs to a particular type of `` cluster '' .",
    "the cluster types considered explicitly in ref .",
    "are : singles ( isolated magnetic ions which are not connected by any exchange bonds ) , pairs , open triplets ( ots ) , and closed triplets ( cts ) .",
    "more recently the six types of quartets in the fcc lattice were considered also.@xcite    assuming that @xmath4 is negative ( antiferromagnetic ) , the magnetization curve at low @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for clusters of a given type has two main features : a quick saturation of the zero - field moment followed by a series of mst s .",
    "@xcite this behavior is illustrated by the exact calculation of the magnetization curve for small clusters in this simple model .",
    "we will use normalized fields @xmath21 for the step positions .",
    "pairs of eu@xmath10 ions ( @xmath22 ) have no zero - field moment .",
    "the seven msts from pairs occur at normalized fields @xmath23 .",
    "thus the pairs saturate at @xmath24 .",
    "the next most important clusters are open triplets .",
    "they have a zero - field groundstate with a net spin of 7/2 which saturates quickly .",
    "the msts occur at @xmath25 .",
    "closed triplets have their msts at @xmath26 .",
    "note that the last three msts due to triplets occur when the pairs are already saturated . for five of the six types of quartets",
    "the series of msts end at 28@xmath17 ; only the `` string quartet '' ramp ends at a lower field @xmath27.@xcite    the exchange constant @xmath4 is usually obtained from the observed @xmath28 for pairs since , except for singles , these are the most numerous . as was done in ref .",
    ", we estimate an uncertainty in the determination of @xmath4 due to simplifications introduced by the single-@xmath4 model .",
    "the cubic crystal - field anisotropy , the dipole - dipole interaction , and exchange constants other than @xmath4 basically shift and broaden the msts .",
    "their effects on the positions of the msts from pairs are included in the equation @xmath29 with @xmath30 . the shifts @xmath31 depend on @xmath32 , the orientation of the sample ( anisotropy ) and the concentration ( further neighbor exchange constants ) .",
    "we have calculated the magnetization and step postition of pairs taking into account the cubic crystal field and dipole - dipole interactions , using known parameters.@xcite if @xmath4 is determined from a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , assuming a constant @xmath31 ( the procedure used below ) , the resulting error due to the crystal field anisotropy is less than 5% .",
    "the error due to dipole - dipole interactions is less than 1% .",
    "exchange interactions with further neighbors ( not included in the single-@xmath4 model will also shift and broaden the msts.@xcite these effects will be discussed later in connection with the data analysis .",
    "the magnetization @xmath33 of the sample as a whole is obtained by adding the contributions of the various cluster types .",
    "the contribution of each cluster type is the product of the magnetization per cluster and the number of clusters of that type . to calculate the number of clusters of a given type one needs to know how the magnetic ions are distributed over the cation sites .",
    "normally , a random distribution is assumed .",
    "the populations of the various cluster types are then well known.@xcite as discussed later , deviations from a random distribution can be detected by analyzing the measured magnetization curve at low temperatures .",
    "the ability to detect such deviations is a major advantage .",
    "any tendency of the magnetic ions to bunch together or to avoid each other is revealed .",
    "the determination of the af exchange constant @xmath4 is independent of the spatial distribution however .    in ref .",
    "the theoretical simulations of the magnetization curves included clusters up to triplets . in the present work",
    "the simulations were improved by adding the contributions of the six types of quartets.@xcite in addition a rough estimate of the contribution of clusters larger than quartets was also included , as will be discussed shortly , so that all the spins were accounted for .",
    "clusters larger than quartets ( quintets , sextets , etc . ) will be referred to collectively as `` others '' .",
    "if the zero - field ground state of any such cluster has a net spin then this net spin will align rapidly with @xmath34 at low @xmath19 . at higher fields",
    "a series of msts will occur . in practice , the msts from large clusters are very small in size , so that they are not resolved .",
    "the series of msts from a given cluster type then merges to form a ramp .",
    "the ramp ends at a field which depends on the cluster type .",
    "the magnetization curve of the others is therefore a sum of many initial fast rises of @xmath33 followed by a superposition of many ramps ending at different fields . here",
    ", we use an approximation in which the contribution of the others is represented by a single initial fast rise of @xmath33 followed by one ramp .",
    "the initial fast rise is approximated by a brillouin function for spin 7/2 with a saturation value corresponding to 1/5 of the saturation value of the others .",
    "the 1/5 weight is motivated by earlier results for the initial rise of the magnetization.@xcite the remaining magnetization rise ( 4/5 of the saturation value of the others ) is approximated by a single ramp which starts at @xmath35 and ends at @xmath36 .",
    "the latter value is expected to be slightly higher than the average saturation value for all quintets but lower than the average saturation value of sextets .    for our samples ,",
    "the contribution of others to the magnetization was small , only 0.2% of the saturation magnetization @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and only 0.6% of @xmath37 for @xmath39 . even for the sample with @xmath40",
    "the others contributed only 9% of @xmath41 .",
    "our approximation for the contribution of the others should therefore be adequate .",
    "the three pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te samples were grown by the bridgman method .",
    "the eu concentration @xmath2 was determined from the saturation magnetization .",
    "a moment of @xmath42 per eu ion ( based on @xmath43 and @xmath12 ) was assumed .",
    "a small correction for the lattice susceptibility , @xmath44  emu / g , was applied.@xcite the results for the three samples gave @xmath2 = 1.9 , 2.6 and 6.0% .",
    "these values are supported by the curie constants , obtained from susceptibility data , which gave @xmath2 = 1.9 , 2.4 , and 5.9% , respectively .",
    "we shall adopt the first set of values , which we regard as more accurate .",
    "the eu concentration @xmath2 was also obtained from microprobe measurements .",
    "approximately 35 spots on a single surface of each of the samples were probed .",
    "each spot had a diameter of 5  @xmath8 m , and probed the eu concentration to a depth of about 2  @xmath8 m .",
    "the average values for @xmath2 and the standard deviations were @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the large standard deviation for the second sample is due to a small region of higher concentration near one corner .",
    "the other two samples , particularly the one with the highest concentration , were quite homogeneous on length scales larger than several @xmath8 m .",
    "magnetization measurements at 20  mk were made using a force magnetometer which operated in the mixing chamber of a plastic dilution refrigerator .",
    "this equipment was described earlier.@xcite the main magnetic field @xmath34 , up to 50  koe , was generated by a superconducting magnet .",
    "the force was produced by a superimposed dc field gradient , @xmath47  koe / cm , which was generated by an independent set of superconducting coils . with this gradient",
    "the variation of the field over the volume of the sample was less than 0.2  koe .",
    "none of the samples were oriented , so that the direction of the field relative to the crystallographic axes was not known . as discussed later ,",
    "the anisotropy in pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te is small , so that field orientation is not critical .",
    "the magnetization was also measured in fields up to 180  koe using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) which was adapted for use in a bitter magnet .",
    "the samples were immersed in liquid @xmath48he at 0.6  k. other magnetization data were taken with a squid magnetometer system @xcite at temperatures above 2  k and in fields up to 50  koe . among the data taken with this system were the low - field susceptibility data used to obtain the curie constant and the curie - weiss temperature @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the top half of the magnetization curve at 20  mk for @xmath38 .",
    "the fast rise at the lowest fields is due to the alignment of singles , with minor contributions from other clusters with zero - field moments .",
    "this initial fast rise of @xmath33 is followed by a large ramp on which six msts are clearly visible .",
    "the six msts are due to pairs .",
    "only six , instead of seven , msts are visible because the first mst is masked by the large initial fast rise of @xmath33 on which it is superimposed .",
    "the ramp due to pairs ends near 28  koe .",
    "it is followed by a much less steep ramp due to open triplets ( ots ) which ends near 43  koe .",
    "( the ot ramp is predicted to start well before the pair ramp ends , but because the pair ramp is so much steeper the ot ramp does not stand out in this field region . ) for this sample , with the lowest concentration , the magnetization becomes practically saturated once the ot ramp ends .",
    "the lowest curve in fig .  [ fig2 ] shows the differential susceptibility ( field derivative of the magnetization ) obtained numerically from the data in fig .",
    "the six msts due to pairs appear as large peaks .",
    "three much smaller peaks are seen between 34 and 43  koe .",
    "these are the last msts from the ots .",
    "to our knowledge this is the first clear observation of msts from triplets in a dms .",
    "the other two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show similar results for pair and triplet msts in the other two samples .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows magnetization curves for two of the samples at 0.6  k. these curves extend to fields of about 180  koe .",
    "also shown , for comparison , are the corresponding magnetization curves at 20  mk , adjusted so that they agree with the 0.6  k data at 50  koe .",
    "the main differences between the 0.6  k and 20  mk data are that at 0.6  k the initial rise of @xmath33 is more gradual , the pair ramp is more rounded , and the pair msts are not resolved .",
    "these differences are the expected effect of temperature . the data at 0.6  k show that for @xmath38 complete saturation is achieved near 60  koe . for @xmath49",
    "however , the approach to saturation is more gradual because a larger percentage of the spins are in large clusters which saturate more slowly .      in all three samples the pair and triplets involving the exchange constant @xmath4 gave rise to distinct ramps on which well - resolved msts were observed .",
    "no additional ramps or msts from any other exchange constant were found .",
    "the single-@xmath4 model therefore seems to be appropriate for describing the magnetization curves .",
    "additional evidence that the corrections for the single-@xmath4 model are small will be discussed later .    the fields @xmath50 at the pair msts were obtained from the peaks in fig .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a plot of these fields for the three samples .",
    "because the first mst was not observed , the plot is only for @xmath517 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath50 is approximately linear in @xmath32 , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with a constant @xmath31 is a good approximation ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the values for @xmath4 obtained from least squares fits to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , holding @xmath52 constant , were the same for all three samples within 2% .",
    "the average value was @xmath53  k. the values for @xmath31 obtained from fits of the three data sets to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) were all positive .",
    "the average was @xmath54  koe , which is only a fraction of the spacing @xmath55  koe between successive msts .    as far as further neigbor exchange interactions are concerned",
    ", we can say the following .",
    "the data show that any other af exchange constant is at least a factor of 3 smaller than the observed @xmath4 .",
    "if this were not the case , another noticeable ramp ending between 10  koe and 30  koe should have been present , leading to a change of slope in this field region .",
    "such a change of slope was not observed .",
    "furthermore , the observed msts show only a small amount of non - thermal broadening and @xmath31 depends only weakly on @xmath2 .",
    "these observations show that the magnetization above about 10  koe is very little affected by other ( smaller ) exchange constants originating from further neigbors .",
    "the following arguments indicate that the quoted value @xmath53  k corresponds to the largest af exchange constant . the 0.6  k data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show no other msts or ramps in fields up to 175  koe .",
    "this means that if there were any larger af exchange constant , its magnitude should have exceeded 12  k. on the other hand the curie - weiss temperatures discussed below rule out such a large af exchange constant .",
    "thus , the observed msts gave the largest @xmath4 .",
    "our final result is then that the dominant exchange constant has the value @xmath56",
    "k. the 7% uncertainty is motivated by the calculations of the corrections mentioned in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , and the observation that further neighbor interactions affect the msts very little .",
    "this @xmath4 for pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te is only slightly larger than @xmath57  k for pb@xmath0eu@xmath9se.@xcite there was no measurable dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath2 in the present pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , despite the fact that the band gap changes by nearly a factor of 2 as @xmath2 changes from 1.9 to 6.0%.@xcite the fields at the three observed msts from ots , above 32  koe , are close to those expected from the value of @xmath4 derived from the pair steps .",
    "this means that the exchange constants for pairs and triplets are the same ( within a few percents ) , as expected .",
    "low - field susceptibility data were taken at temperatures down to 2  k. the most accurate result for @xmath15 was for the sample with @xmath58% . with the usual assumptions @xcite the value @xmath59  k gave @xmath60  k ( assuming @xmath61 ) .",
    "the results for the other two samples , with lower @xmath2 , were @xmath62 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath63  k ( @xmath38 ) , but these were judged to be less accurate .",
    "the values found by gorska _",
    "_ @xcite were @xmath64  k for @xmath65 , and @xmath66  k for @xmath40 .",
    "the spread in the values of @xmath4 obtained from @xmath15 shows that that the experimental uncertainty is not negligible , especially for low concentrations .",
    "determining @xmath4 from the curie - weiss @xmath15 has several other drawbacks .",
    "first , it assumes that the distribution of the eu ions is random , which , as discussed later , may not be exactly true for pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te .",
    "second , @xmath15 depends on all exchange constants .",
    "third , even when one @xmath4 is much larger than all the others , its estimate depends on whether it is identified as @xmath67 ( between nns , as was done above ) or @xmath18 ( between nnns ) .",
    "the identification of @xmath4 as @xmath18 would lead to an estimate of @xmath4 which is larger by a factor of 2 compared to @xmath61 .",
    "the msts method is a direct determination of @xmath4 , which is independent of the identification of @xmath4 , and is also independent of the spatial distribution of the eu ions .",
    "gorska _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also determined @xmath4 by analyzing the magnetization curve at 4.2  k. at this relatively high temperature , @xmath68 , the msts are not resolved , and the ramps due to pairs and ots do not stand out clearly .",
    "the analysis which was performed fitted the magnetization curve to a sum of two contributions : one from singles and the other from `` pairs '' .",
    "the value for @xmath4 was deduced from the pair contribution .",
    "the results were @xmath69  k for @xmath65 , and @xmath70  k for @xmath40 .",
    "the reason that these values are much higher than our value of @xmath71  k , is that the assumed `` pairs '' actually included not only true pairs but also triplets , quartets , and larger clusters .",
    "since the saturation field of a cluster increases with cluster size , the net effect was that the assumed pairs saturated at higher fields than true pairs .",
    "this caused the deduced @xmath4 to be higher than the true @xmath4 .",
    "it is probably significant that the fitted @xmath4 was larger for @xmath40 than for @xmath65 , because the percentage of large clusters increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the identity of the dominant af exchange constant @xmath4 , whether it is @xmath67 for nns or @xmath18 for nnns , is a significant issue .",
    "normally , exchange constants decrease rapidly with distance , so that the dominant @xmath4 is between nns .",
    "this expected normal behavior has been found in all mn - based ii ",
    "vi dms.@xcite on the other hand , in pure eute the largest exchange constant is @xmath18 , which is antiferromagnetic with a value of about @xmath72  k. the exchange constant @xmath67 in eute is ferromagnetic and smaller in magnitude.@xcite thus , after @xmath4 was measured in the present work , it was still not obvious whether it was @xmath67 or @xmath18 .    to address this problem the measured magnetization curves were compared with computer simulations based on the two competing hypotheses : @xmath73 ( @xmath67 model ) , or @xmath74 ( @xmath18 model ) .",
    "both models are single-@xmath4 models .",
    "the simulations were similar to those in ref .   except that they also included the quartets and the others .",
    "we also chose to normalize the magnetization curves to the saturation value @xmath41 rather than to the data point at the highest field ( see ref . ) .",
    "the key assumption in the simulations was that the eu ions were distributed randomly , i.e. , the probability of occupation of each cation site in the crystal was @xmath2 .",
    "the simulations with the @xmath67 - and @xmath18 models lead to different magnetization curves , essentially because there are 12 nns but only 6 nnns in the fcc cation lattice .",
    "this difference means that in the @xmath18 model the number of singles is higher and the populations of pairs and larger clusters are lower .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] compares the magnetization curves at 20  mk , for @xmath75 and 2.6% , with simulations based on the two models . to account for the somewhat larger observed width of the msts than that expected from thermal broadening alone , the simulations of data at 20  mk used an effective temperature of 100  mk .",
    "this change has no effect on the discussion below .",
    "@xcite the simulation of data at 0.6  k were made with the actual temperature . from the figure it is clear that the @xmath67 model simulation is closer to the data , but even this model fails to reproduce the measured curves exactly .",
    "the deviations are more pronounced for @xmath76% .",
    "the observed initial rise of @xmath33 is smaller than predicted , indicating that even the @xmath67 model overestimates the number of singles .",
    "furthermore , the observed slope between 30 and 40  koe is higher than predicted by both models .",
    "this means that there are more triplets and/or larger clusters than calculated using a random distribution .",
    "the same features are also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which is for @xmath49 at 20  mk and at 0.6  k. the @xmath67 model is closer to the data , but even compared to this model the actual number of singles is lower and the number of triplets and/or larger clusters is higher .",
    "these results indicate that the _ local _ eu concentration in the vicinity of a typical eu ion is higher than the average concentration for the sample as a whole .",
    "thus , the eu ions tend to bunch together , leading to an inhomogeneous eu distribution .",
    "the size of the regions with higher eu concentration can not be inferred from analysis of the magnetization curves alone .",
    "the microprobe measurements ( sec .  [ experiment ] ) examined the concentration variations on length scales greater than a few @xmath8 m .",
    "the attempt to account for the magnetization curves by using the microprobe results as the local concentration profile was unsuccessful .",
    "this is particularly evident for the sample with @xmath49 , in which the microprobe concentration showed very little variation with position .",
    "combining the analysis of the magnetization data with the microprobe results we conclude that the length scale of the concentration inhomogeneities was smaller than a few @xmath8 m .    a quantitative measure of the degree to which the eu ions bunch together can be obtained by introducing the concept of a local concentration @xmath77 .",
    "the simple picture which is behind this concept presumes that there is a typical local concentration in the vicinity of a typical eu ion .",
    "it can differ from the average concentration @xmath2 for the sample as a whole .",
    "the populations of the various clusters are calculated assuming that the probability of occupation of each cation sites in the vicinity of a eu ion is @xmath78 instead of @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is found by varying the eu concentration in the simulation until a match with the experimental magnetization curve is achieved .",
    "using this procedure the following results were obtained for the samples with @xmath2 = 1.9 , 2.6 and 6.0% . with the @xmath67 model ,",
    "@xmath78 = 2.5 , 3.8 , and 7.7% , respectively . with the @xmath18 model , @xmath78 = 4.7 , 7 , and 14% , respectively .",
    "obviously , a much smaller difference between @xmath78 and @xmath2 is required to achieve agreement with the @xmath67 model .    in the discussion above",
    ", we have assumed that the deviations of the data from a single-@xmath4 model were due to the assumption of a random distribution .",
    "an alternative would be to question the validity of the single-@xmath4 model itself .",
    "it is known that long range exchange interactions between further neighbors can influence the magnetization process in diluted magnetic semiconductors.@xcite such long - range interactions may be important in small - gap dms , such as the present system . the key question here is whether long - range interactions could have affected the magnetization in fields above 10 koe significantly , since the conclusion of a non - random distribution was based on the data at these high fields , especially above 30  koe .",
    "the effects of further neighbors ( distant neighbors ) on the magnetization curve have been treated using several approximate methods .",
    "one approach starts from the clusters in the single - j model , but then subjects these clusters to effective fields arising from further neighbors.@xcite alternative approaches use more general spin clusters which include further neighbors within the clusters , so that the intracluster interactions already include the further neighbors.@xcite since our analysis started from the single - j model , the first approach ( effective fields acting on the single - j clusters ) is more convenient here .",
    "the effective fields from further neighbors slow down the alignment of spins which are singles , and they shift and broaden the ramps and msts arising from larger clusters ( e.g. pairs and triplets ) .",
    "these effects increase with the eu concentration @xmath2 .",
    "we now present several arguments which indicate that in the present work the further - neighbor effective fields were far too weak to significantly affect the magnetization curve well above 10 koe .    at 20",
    "mk the magnetization rises very quicly at low @xmath34 ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the singles seem to become practically saturated at about 2  koe . considering that the cubic crystal field anisotropy also slows down the alignment of the singles,@xcite",
    "we conclude that typical further - neighbor effective fields acting on singles are less than about 1  koe .",
    "such weak effective fields are unlikely to have a significant effect on the magnetization well above 10  koe .",
    "the fields @xmath28 at the msts from pairs are shifted by the further - neighbors effective fields.@xcite these shifts , included in the @xmath52 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , are predicted to increase with @xmath2 .",
    "however , the results in fig .  [ fig4 ] indicate that the @xmath52 are all less than about 1  koe .",
    "also , despite the factor - of - three change in @xmath2 , the fields @xmath28 do not vary by more than a fraction of 1  koe .",
    "this means that typical further - neighbor effective fields acting on pairs were no more than a fraction of a koe , even for the sample with @xmath79% .",
    "typical effective fields acting on triplets and quartets should not be higher by more than a factor of 2 or so .",
    "it is very unlikely that such weak effective fields will have a significant effect on the magnetization curve well above 10 koe .",
    "the _ spread _ in the magnitude of the effective field acting on different pairs gives rise to a broadening of the msts from pairs.@xcite such a broadening should increase with @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that well resolved msts were observed even for @xmath79% means that the spread in the effective fields was considerably smaller than the 4  koe separation between the msts .",
    "thus not only was the average effective field small , but the spread was also small .",
    "such a distribution of effective fields should not have a significant effect on the magnetization curve well above 10  koe .",
    "the final argument in support of a non - random distribution is based on an analysis of the change in the slope of the magnetization curve near 43  koe .",
    "this change occurs when the triplet ramp ends .",
    "( the change in slope is visible in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and  [ fig5 ] , but is clearer in expanded plots of the magnetization curves at 20  mk . ) the magnitude of this change in slope is related to the number of triplets .",
    "analysis of the data in all three samples indicates a significantly larger number of triplets than predicted assuming a random distribution .",
    "further - neighbor interactions can not account for the significanly larger change in slope which was observed .",
    "claims of a non - random distribution in ii - vi dms have been made more than a decade ago ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "however , mst studies showed that the distribution in such dms was in fact random.@xcite here , in our pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te samples , we find a small non - randomicity which we believe to be genuine . in ref .",
    "( pb@xmath0eu@xmath9se ) deviations of the data with the @xmath67-model were also found , but the simulations included only clusters up to triplets . a re - analysis of those data with our improved model , which includes quartets and an approximation for larger clusters , still does not lead to perfect agreement . as in the present work ,",
    "good agreement with the data is obtained if small deviations from a random distribution are assumed ( and that @xmath73 ) .",
    "the non - randomicity in the pb@xmath0eu@xmath9se samples is smaller than that in the pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te samples .",
    "returning to the issue of the identity of @xmath4 , there are two possibilities .",
    "either @xmath4 is @xmath67 in which case the eu ions have only a fairly modest tendency to bunch together , or @xmath4 is @xmath18 with a very large increase of the local eu concentration . because the usual distribution of magnetic ions in a dms is random,@xcite we believe that the first possibility is more likely . on this basis",
    "we tentatively identify @xmath80  k as @xmath67 .",
    "however , since the actual distribution is unknown , the possibility that it is @xmath18 can not be excluded entirely .",
    "if one accepts that @xmath4 is @xmath67 then the exchange constants in pb@xmath0eu@xmath9te when @xmath2 is low are very different from those in eute.@xcite such a difference may be the result of a different band structure and a different position of the eu levels .",
