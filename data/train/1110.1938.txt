    "the primary production mechanism for the higgs at the lhc is gluon - gluon fusion , with a small contribution from vector boson fusion  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", a search for the sm higgs boson in the @xmath5 channel is presented  @xcite .",
    "this channel is especially suited for high - mass higgs boson searches , and a mass range from 250 to 600 gev/@xmath4 is considered in this analysis .",
    "results are reported based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1  fb@xmath1 , recorded by the cms experiment at the lhc at a center - of - mass energy of 7  tev .",
    "an interpretation of the results in terms of exclusion limits for the higgs boson is also presented in a scenario with a fourth generation of fermions  @xcite added to the sm . for sufficiently large lepton and quark masses ,",
    "this sm extension has not been excluded by existing constraints  @xcite . here",
    "we consider a fourth generation mass of @xmath6  gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the innermost component of the cms detector is the tracking system , equipped with silicon pixel and microstrip detectors , used to measure the momenta of charged particles and reconstruct the interaction vertices .",
    "the tracker is immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 3.8  t and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath7 .",
    "the tracker is surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , made of pbwo@xmath8 crystals , and a brass / scintillating fiber hadronic calorimeter ( hcal ) .",
    "both calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath9 . to improve the detector hermeticity , forward quartz - fiber cherenkov calorimeters ( hf ) extend the coverage up to @xmath10 .",
    "the outermost part of the cms detector is the muon spectrometer , used to measure the momentum of muons traversing through the detector .",
    "it consists of three different types of gaseous detectors embedded in the iron return yoke : drift tube chambers ( dt ) in the barrel , cathode strip chambers ( csc ) in the endcaps , and resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) in both regions",
    ".    a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this analysis , signal and background datasets are produced by detailed monte carlo simulation of the detector response , based on geant4  @xcite , taking into account the limited inter - calibration and alignment precision , and using the full cms reconstruction chain .    the @xmath5 signal and the drell - yan and @xmath11 backgrounds",
    "are generated using the program powheg  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12  +  jets and single top events are simulated using madgraph  @xcite , while the diboson backgrounds ( @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are simulated using pythia  @xcite . in case of the irreducible @xmath2 background",

    "if the mass of the higgs boson is much larger than twice the mass of the @xmath16 boson , each @xmath16 boson produced in the higgs boson decay has a significant transverse momentum ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "consequently , a @xmath22 event is characterized by the presence of a boosted pair of isolated leptons , @xmath23 or @xmath24 , with invariant mass consistent with the @xmath16 mass , and large missing transverse energy ( met ) arising from the decay of the other @xmath16 boson into neutrinos .",
    "since the final state involves two high-@xmath21 isolated leptons , events selected for the analysis are required to pass dilepton triggers . in case of the muon channel ,",
    "a trigger with a threshold of @xmath25  gev/@xmath26 for each muon was used in the initial data - taking period ( about 191 pb@xmath1 ) , while for the remainder of the dataset the thresholds were 13 and 8  gev/@xmath26 for the leading and second muon , respectively . the efficiency for selecting signal events with these dimuon triggers",
    "is found to vary between 95 and 99% , depending on the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the muons . in case of the electron channel",
    ", the trigger has thresholds of @xmath27  gev/@xmath26 on the leading electron and @xmath28  gev/@xmath26 on the second electron . the efficiency for this trigger is found to be larger than 99% .",
    "an event is required to have at least one primary vertex within 24  cm of the geometrical center of the cms detector in the beam direction and within 0.2  cm in the plane transverse to the beam . in events with multiple vertices , the one with the largest value of @xmath29 for the associated tracks",
    "is chosen as the reference vertex .",
    "muon candidates can be reconstructed using two algorithms : one uses tracks in the inner silicon tracker matched to segments in the muon system ; the other algorithm uses tracks produced from a global fit of tracker and muon chamber hits , seeded by segments in the muon system  @xcite .",
    "further identification criteria based on the number of hits in the tracker and the muon system , the fit quality of the muon track and its consistency with the primary vertex , are imposed on the muon candidates to reduce fakes .    electron reconstruction also involves two algorithms , one in which energy clusters in the ecal are matched to hits in the silicon tracker , and another in which tracks in the silicon tracker are matched to the ecal clusters  @xcite .",
    "these reconstructed electrons are required to pass further identification criteria , based on the ecal shower shape , track - ecal cluster matching , and consistency with the primary vertex .",
    "additional requirements are imposed to remove electrons produced in photon conversions . to further suppress the qcd background , leptons are required to be isolated : a cone of radius @xmath30 is defined around the leptons , and the sum of transverse energy deposits in the calorimeters and the transverse momenta of tracks in this cone is computed .",
    "this isolation sum is required to be smaller than 15% ( 10% ) of the momentum of the muon ( electron ) . the median energy expected from pileup interactions",
    "is subtracted from the isolation sum , in order to reduce possible inefficiencies from enhanced detector activity in events with high pileup  @xcite .",
    "events are selected such that there are two well - identified , isolated , opposite - charge leptons of the same flavor , each with @xmath31  gev/@xmath26 , which form an invariant mass consistent with the @xmath16 mass .",
    "in addition , events are required to have exactly two leptons with @xmath32  gev/@xmath26 : events with any additional lepton are rejected in order to reduce the @xmath13 background in which the @xmath12 and @xmath16 bosons both decay leptonically . moreover",
    ", the dilepton candidate is required to have a transverse momentum larger than 25  gev/@xmath26 .",
    "the impact of this cut on signal efficiency is small ( less than 1% for all the higgs boson masses considered ) , but allows the use of @xmath33  +  jets data to effectively model the @xmath16  +  jets background , as explained in the following .        in order to suppress backgrounds containing top quarks ( single top , @xmath11 ) , events with at least one @xmath34-tagged jet",
    "are vetoed .",
    "particle flow jets  @xcite with a transverse energy @xmath35  gev are considered for @xmath34-tagging .",
    "@xmath36-jets are tagged using the `` track counting high efficiency '' ( tche ) algorithm  @xcite , which uses displaced tracks in a jet to compute a @xmath34-tagging discriminator .",
    "the signal process @xmath5 is characterized by a large missing @xmath37 , arising from the two neutrinos in the final state .",
    "therefore , a high threshold is imposed on the particle flow met  @xcite in order to suppress the large drell - yan background , which is characterized by little real missing transverse energy",
    ". however , jet mismeasurements and detector effects can produce large met values in @xmath16  +  jets events .",
    "since this background is five orders of magnitude more abundant than the signal , the contamination of the selected signal region due to the high - met tail is very significant . to further suppress backgrounds with fake met coming from jet mismeasurements , events",
    "in which the met is aligned with a jet are removed using a cut on the @xmath38(met , jet ) variable .",
    "both the met threshold and the @xmath38 cut are dependent on the higgs mass hypothesis , since high - mass higgs events are characterized by larger met .",
    "higgs signal events show a narrower transverse mass distribution than background events , where the higgs transverse mass is defined as @xmath39 an @xmath40-dependent two - sided cut is thus applied to the @xmath41 variable to further separate signal from background .",
    "+ the event selection criteria used in the analysis are listed in table  [ tab : selection ] . for met ,",
    "@xmath38(met , jet ) and @xmath42 cuts , which are smoothly dependent on the higgs mass , thresholds for selected mass points are shown as examples .",

    "upper limits on @xmath43 ( _ above _ ) , and the ratio @xmath44 of such limit to the sm cross section @xmath45 ( _ below _ ) , as functions of the higgs mass @xmath40 .",
    "the results are obtained using a cl@xmath46 approach with a flat prior for the cross section , for 1.1  fb@xmath1 .",
    "such limits are not sufficient to exclude the existence of the sm higgs boson in the examined mass range .",

    "recent analyses show that the use of a qft - consistent higgs propagator , and allowing for the off - shellness of the higgs boson , dynamical qcd scales , and interference effects between higgs signal and backgrounds , will result , at higgs masses above 300  gev/@xmath48 , in a sizable effect on conventionally defined but theoretically consistent parameters ( mass and width ) that describe the propagation of an unstable higgs boson  @xcite . in this work , these effects are included as an additional uncertainty of 10 - 30% ( for 400 to 600  gev/@xmath48 higgs mass ) on the theoretical cross section .",
