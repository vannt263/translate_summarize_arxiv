    "since the word `` graph '' is used in different ways by different authors , we note here that in the current paper as well as in @xcite a _ graph _ is defined to be a connected @xmath14-complex consisting of a finite number of vertices and edges such that every edge has two distinct vertices and there is at most one edge with a given pair of vertices .    in section 2 ,",
    "we prove theorem  [ theorem1 ] . in section 3 , we prove theorem  [ icmanifolds ] making use of a proposition , which we then prove in section 4 . throughout the paper we work in the smooth category .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove theorem  [ theorem1 ] . to that end , we prove the following proposition . note that we use @xmath15 to denote the dimension of the first @xmath16-homology group of @xmath0 and we use @xmath17 to denote the dimension of the first @xmath18-homology group of @xmath0 .",

    "[ prop : inf ]    the proof of proposition  [ prop : inf ] will make use of the idea of a _ disk - busting _ curve , which is a simple closed curve in a handlebody that intersects every essential , properly embedded disk in the handlebody .",
    "for example , a core of a solid torus is disk busting in the solid torus . for a genus 2 handlebody with fundamental group generated by @xmath22 and @xmath23 an example of a disk - busting curve is one that includes into the fundamental group of the handlebody as @xmath24 ( see figure  [ diskbust ] ) .",
    "all handlebodies have disk - busting curves and richard stong @xcite gives an algorithm to recognize them . for more on disk - busting curves see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be the genus of a closed orientable surface @xmath19 .",

    "now @xmath0 is a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold @xmath0 such that @xmath28 .",
    "however , @xmath0 is reducible .    in order to create an irreducible 3-manifold",
    ", we first remove neighborhoods @xmath29 and @xmath30 of identical disk busting curves @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the interiors of the handlebodies @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are interchanged by the involution @xmath6 .",
    "note that since @xmath33 consists of two identical handlebodies from which neighborhoods of disk busting curves have been removed , the inclusion of @xmath19 in each component of @xmath33 is incompressible .",
    "now we sew in identical non - trivial knot complements @xmath34 and @xmath35 along @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively so that the seifert surfaces of the @xmath38 are glued in where the meridians of the @xmath39 were .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the 3-manifold obtained in this way .",
    "then the restriction @xmath40 can be extended to an orientation reversing involution of @xmath20 that pointwise fixes @xmath19 .",
    "note that the components of @xmath41 that contain @xmath19 are homeomorphic to the corresponding components of @xmath42 that contain @xmath19 .",
    "* claim 1 : * the surfaces @xmath19 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are each incompressible in @xmath20    * proof of claim 1 : * assume one of @xmath19 , @xmath43 , or @xmath44 is compressible in @xmath20 . then there is a compressing disk @xmath45 for one of these surfaces that meets @xmath46 transversally in a minimal number of components .",
    "if the interior of @xmath45 intersects one of the surfaces @xmath19 , @xmath43 , or @xmath44 , then an innermost loop on @xmath45 bounds a compressing disk @xmath47 for that surface whose interior is disjoint from the other surfaces .",
    "now since each @xmath38 is a knot complement , @xmath47 can not be contained in @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath47 must be contained in some component of @xmath48 .",
    "also , since the @xmath49 are disk busting for the @xmath50 , @xmath51 can not be in @xmath19 .",
    "so @xmath47 is a compressing disk for one of the @xmath52 in @xmath53 . by compressing along @xmath47",
    "we obtain a sphere in @xmath53 .",
    "hence @xmath39 is contained in a ball in @xmath50 , contradicting the fact that @xmath49 was disk busting .",
    "* claim 2 : * @xmath20 is irreducible .",
    "* proof of claim 2 : * let @xmath54 be a sphere in @xmath20 and assume without loss of generality that @xmath54 intersects @xmath46 transversally in a minimal number of components .",
    "if @xmath54 intersects any of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , or @xmath19 , then there is an innermost loop on @xmath54 bounding a disk @xmath45 that is a compressing disk for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , or @xmath19 in @xmath55 . but this violates claim 1 .",
    "thus @xmath54 is contained in some @xmath38 or @xmath56",
    ". however , the @xmath38 and the @xmath56 are irreducible .",
    "therefore @xmath20 is irreducible .",
    "now , recall that @xmath28 .",
    "also , it can be seen using a mayer - vietoris sequence that replacing the handlebodies @xmath29 and @xmath30 by the knot complements @xmath34 and @xmath35 does not change the first homology , since a meridional disk of @xmath39 is replaced by a seifert surface in @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath21 , and hence @xmath20 has the properties required by the proposition .    in order to prove that we can find infinitely many such 3-manifolds @xmath20 , we first show as follows that if @xmath38 is the complement of a connected sum of distinct knots @xmath57 , then @xmath20 contains at least @xmath58 disjoint non - parallel incompressible tori .",
    "the first such torus is a boundary parallel torus in @xmath38 .",
    "the second such torus is a follow - swallow torus that swallows @xmath59 and follows the other @xmath60 tori .",
    "the third swallows @xmath61 and follows the other @xmath62 and so on , each time swallowing one more knot and following one less until the @xmath63 torus swallows all of the @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "since we have @xmath66 such disjoint tori in each @xmath38 , this gives us @xmath58 such disjoint tori in @xmath20 .",
    "these tori can not be parallel to each other since they bound distinct knot complements in @xmath38 .    to see that these @xmath58 tori are incompressible in @xmath20 , suppose there is a compressing disk for one of the tori that intersects @xmath67 transversally in a minimal number of components .",
    "an innermost loop on the disk would be a compressing disk for @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath19 , again contradicting claim 1 .",
    "thus the torus would have to be compressible in one of the @xmath38 .",
    "but it is well known that follow - swallow tori are incompressible in knot complements , so the @xmath58 tori must be incompressible in @xmath20 as well .",
    "thus @xmath20 contains @xmath58 disjoint , non - parallel , incompressible tori . on the other hand , it follows from kneser - haken finiteness , that for a given compact , orientable manifold , such as @xmath20 , there is some finite constant @xmath68 such that @xmath20 can not contain more than @xmath68 disjoint closed , non - parallel , incompressible surfaces ( for example , see proposition 1.7 in @xcite or see @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath69 .    to get a manifold @xmath70 which is not homeomorphic to @xmath20 ,",
    "we replace each @xmath38 by the complement of a knot that is the connected sum of more than @xmath71 knots .",
    "now @xmath70 will contain @xmath72 disjoint , non - parallel , incompressible tori with @xmath73 , and thus @xmath70 is distinct from @xmath20 . by repeating this process",
    ", we can create an infinite sequence of such manifolds each containing more disjoint , non - parallel , incompressible tori than the previous manifold did .",
    "since every graph embeds in a closed orientable surface , the following theorem is an immediate consequence of proposition  [ prop : inf ] .",
    "[ theorem1 ] for every graph @xmath2 , there are infinitely many closed , connected , orientable , irreducible 3-manifolds @xmath0 such that some embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath0 is pointwise fixed by an orientation reversing involution of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove our main result .",
    "we begin with the following definition .",
    "we define the _ genus of a closed surface _ @xmath19 by @xmath74    then the _ genus of a graph _ is defined as the minimum genus of any closed surface in which the graph embeds .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the genus of a non - orientable surface is not consistently defined in the literature .",
    "some papers use our definition , while others define the projective plane as having genus 1 instead of @xmath75 .    let @xmath0 be a closed , connected , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold",
    ". then by kneser - haken finiteness @xcite , @xmath0 contains at most finitely many non - parallel disjoint incompressible tori .",
    "let @xmath76 denote either the maximal possible number of non - parallel disjoint incompressible tori in @xmath0 or 2 , whichever is larger .",
    "now we define @xmath77 .",
    "we will refer to the constants @xmath3 and @xmath76 in the statements and proofs of theorem  [ icmanifolds ] and proposition  [ mainprop ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a 3-connected graph with genus at least 2 , and let @xmath4 be an embedding of @xmath2 in a closed , connected , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold @xmath0 such that @xmath7 has an orientation reversing homeomorphism fixing every vertex of @xmath4 .",
    "then there is an embedding @xmath78 of @xmath2 in a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold @xmath79 such that @xmath80 has an orientation reversing involution pointwise fixing @xmath78 and @xmath81    the point of this proposition is that if we have an embedding @xmath4 of a graph @xmath2 in a manifold @xmath0 such that @xmath82 has an orientation reversing _ homeomorphism _ , then we can find a ( possibly different ) manifold @xmath79 and an embedding @xmath78 of @xmath2 in @xmath79 such that @xmath80 has an orientation reversing _",

    "note that the orientation reversing homeomorphism in the hypothesis of proposition  [ mainprop ] , leaves each edge of @xmath4 setwise invariant since , according to our definition of a graph , there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices .",

    "proposition  [ mainprop ] will be proved in the next section .",
    "we now prove theorem  [ icmanifolds ] ( restated below ) by making use of proposition  [ mainprop ] together with the following result of kobayashi .",
    "@xcite let @xmath84 be a closed , orientable , 3-manifold admitting an orientation reversing involution @xmath6 .",

    "hence we can express the order of @xmath91 as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is odd .",
    "now since @xmath90 is orientation reversing and @xmath94 is odd , @xmath95 is also an orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath7 .",
