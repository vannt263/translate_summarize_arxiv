    "the molecular dipole moments of the @xmath48  and @xmath36  states arise in our model from the mixing with the neighboring ( @xmath4 - 1)d@xmath13 states induced by the fermi - contact interaction terms in the hamiltonian . for the 32p@xmath5,6s@xmath1(@xmath2=4),@xmath48(@xmath54 ) states , our model predicts dipole moments ranging from 21.0 to 25.8  d ( mean value 24.4  d ) for @xmath55 values between 1/2 and 9/2 .",
    "the dipole moments predicted for the 32p@xmath5,6s@xmath1(@xmath2=4),@xmath36(@xmath54 ) states are smaller and range from -0.5 to 12.0  d ( mean value 5.6  d ) for @xmath55 values between 1/2 and 7/2 .",
    "the polarization of the excitation laser ( linear and parallel to the dc electric field ) favors the excitation of molecules which are aligned parallel to the electric field axis and one expects the zero - field resonance to evolve in a double - peak structure with a splitting of @xmath56 ( dashed lines in fig .

    "while the observed broadenings are in qualitative agreement with the predicted stark shifts , the asymmetric line shape of the 32p@xmath5,6s@xmath1(@xmath2=4),@xmath48(@xmath40=0 ) level is not captured by our model and would require a diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian including the interaction with the external electric field and consideration of the rotational structure  @xcite ."
