    "this paper presents an updated and largely enhanced version of the program glissando ",
    "glauber initial - state simulation and more ... , originally published in  @xcite .",
    "the popular glauber  @xcite approach to the early phase of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is both physical and practical to use in a variety of applications where modelling of the initial phase is needed . in this semi - classical approach",
    "the individual collisions between the nucleons ( _ wounded nucleons _",
    "@xcite , possibly admixed with _ binary collisions _",
    "@xcite ) deposit entropy or energy density with a certain distribution in the transverse plane and rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the obtained spatial distribution of _ sources _ , which fluctuates event - by - event according to the statistical nature of the distributions of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , is usually used as input for the intermediate phase of the evolution , typically modelled with relativistic hydrodynamics or cascade models ( for a review of the heavy - ion phenomenology see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the sources may fluctuate as well , according to a superimposed distribution  @xcite .",
    "we call this variable _ relative deposited strength _ ( rds ) .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the usefulness of the glauber monte carlo simulations comes from the fact that in collider experiments one usually determines in this way the dependence of the number of participants on centrality @xcite . on the physics side ,",
    "the presence of the event - by - event fluctuations in the initial glauber phase ( for recent reviews see  @xcite ) is a crucial aspect of the approach",
    ". these geometric fluctuations @xcite are carried over to the final distributions of the experimentally measured hadrons .",
    "they influence the harmonic flow coefficients , in particular generate the odd components such as the triangular flow  @xcite , as well as induce the correlations between the reaction planes of various harmonic flow components  @xcite .",
    "the output of glauber monte carlo simulations may be used as input for the event - by - event hydrodynamics  @xcite ,    other aspects are also studied theoretically in this approach , such as the forward - backward correlations  @xcite , the two - dimensional correlations in relative rapidity and azimuth  @xcite , or the jet quenching  @xcite .    the applications listed above show that in the active field of studying the initial stage of the relativistic heavy - ion collisions there is demand for tools implementing the glauber modeling , which our updated version of glissando tries to satisfy .",
    "the new features implemented in glissando 2 include :    * parametrization of shape of all typical nuclei , including light nuclei .",
    "this is useful in applications for the na61 experiment , where the mass - number scan will be carried out  @xcite . *",
    "inclusion of the deformation of the colliding nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the deformation effects are relevant for the collisions involving the deformed au and u nuclei  @xcite recently used at rhic . *",
    "possibility of using correlated distributions of nucleons in nuclei  @xcite , which may be read - in from external files prepared earlier with other codes , e.g. ,  @xcite . certainly , the two - body correlations are important , as they influence the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "* generalization of the nn collision profile a shape which interpolates between the step function and a gaussian profile  @xcite .",
    "such an extension is relevant for the collisions at the lhc energies , allowing to reproduce the measured values of both the total and elastic nn cross sections  @xcite . *",
    "inclusion of the negative binomial overlaid distribution ( in addition to the poissonian and gamma distributions ) . * possibility of overlaying distributions of the produced particles which depend on the space - time rapidity .",
    "this feature extends the model into a fully 3 + 1 dimensional tool .",
    "* inclusion of the core - corona effect  @xcite . *",
    "the structure of the c++ code has been simplified and the organization of the package is restructured . * a doxygen - generated @xcite reference manual is available , which is useful for those who wish to alter the code for their needs .",
    "we recall the original relevant features of the code :    * possibility of superimposing a distribution of weights over the distribution of individual sources , reflecting the fact that the elementary collisions may result in the deposition of a varying amount of the entropy / energy . *",
    "the built - in analysis of the shape fluctuations  @xcite . * evaluation and storage of the two - dimensional density profiles to be used `` off - line '' in other analyses , such us the event - by - event initial condition for hydrodynamics , jet quenching , _ etc . _",
    "* output of the event - by - event data that can be used to generate input for hydrodynamics . *",
    "the code can also be directly used for the proton - nucleus and deuteron - nucleus collisions .",
    "the hulthen distribution is used to describe the @xmath1 separation in the deuteron . *",
    "the code uses the standard cern root libraries and data structures .    in this paper",
    "we only describe the new features of glissando 2 , hence the user should also refer to the original paper for a more complete description of the physics behind the code and its basic features  @xcite .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath7 should be of the order of the hard - core repulsion range in the nuclear potential .",
    "the repulsion implemented via an expulsion radius increases somewhat the size @xmath8 of the nucleus and this swelling must be compensated by an appropriate shrinkage the parameters of the distribution from which the positions of centers of nucleons are generated ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath9 , appropriately smaller values of the parameter @xmath4 must be used to ensure that the single - particle radial density of the simulated nucleus is properly reproduced .",

    "<S> the increased functionality of the code incorporates a parametrization of shape of nuclei , including light nuclei needed in the na61 experiment , the nuclear deformation , a possibility of using correlated distributions of nucleons in nuclei read from external files , an option of overlaying distributions of produced particles dependent on the space - time rapidity , the inclusion of the core - corona effect , or the output of the source distributions that can be used in event - by - event hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> together with other features , such as incorporation of various variants of glauber models , or the implementation of a realistic nn collision profile , the generator offers a realistic and practical approach to describe the early phase of the collision in 3 + 1 dimensions ; the predictions may later be used in modeling the intermediate evolution phase , e.g. , with hydrodynamics . </S>",
