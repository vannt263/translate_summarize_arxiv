    "studies of the globular cluster ( gc ) system of the milky way have benefited from the wealth of information that is available .",
    "however such studies are also fundamentally limited by the small sample size of about 150 objects .",
    "discerning more subtle trends in gc properties , or finding gcs in more extreme astrophysical states , requires larger samples which can only be found in the gc systems of other galaxies .",
    "one such trend which was revealed first in extragalactic gc systems , and not seen in the milky way gc system , is the so - called ` blue tilt ' . the blue tilt ( a trend for the blue gc subpopulation to have redder colours at brighter magnitudes ) has been found using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in a variety of galaxies from the most massive ellipticals ( harris et al .",
    "2006 ) , to lower mass ellipticals ( strader et al . 2006 ) and even dwarfs ( mieske et al .",
    "it has also been detected in an early - type spiral galaxy , the sombrero , by spitler et al .",
    "it has not been detected in any hst study of late - type spirals , but the few studies to date ( e.g. goudfrooij et al . 2003 ) have generally used the wfpc2 camera which has a more limited field - of - view compared to the acs camera and hence such studies have focused on the bulge region and their associated red gcs .",
    "interestingly , at this stage , it has not been detected in the rich gc system of the massive elliptical m49 ( strader et al .",
    "2006 ; mieske et al .",
    "2006a ) .    given the evidence that extragalactic gcs are mostly old ( brodie & strader 2006 ) , the blue tilt implies a mass - metallicity relation for the metal - poor subpopulation of gcs ( although this has yet to be confirmed spectroscopically ) .",
    "various explanations have been proposed ( see bekki et al . 2007 ;",
    "mieske et al .",
    "2006a ; mieske 2009 ) , but perhaps the most plausible explanation to date is one of self enrichment , whereby more massive gcs are enriched with more heavier metals during their brief formation period .    in the self enrichment models of strader & smith ( 2008 ) and bailin & harris ( 2009 ) ,",
    "a single generation of star formation and resulting supernovae is responsible for the self enrichment of each gc , which only becomes important above a threshold mass of @xmath1 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "both models predict heavy element abundance variations within each massive gc , which may be the situation in some extragalactic gc systems ( e.g. cenarro et al .",
    "the galactic gc system includes only a few gcs with masses @xmath7 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 , so a clear signature of variation in colour ( or metallicity ) with magnitude ( a blue tilt ) is difficult to detect .",
    "it is thus important to determine whether galaxies similar to the milky way reveal a gc blue tilt or not .",
    "recently the acs was used to study the star cluster system of the sc galaxy ngc 3370 by cantiello et al .",
    "ngc 3370 is a near face - on spiral at a somewhat larger distance of 28.7 mpc .",
    "these two properties make it more difficult to study its gc system .",

    "1987 ) spiral with a total v band magnitude of 9.84 ( ned ) .",
    "it lies at a galactic latitude of 43@xmath10 , making the surrounding field relatively free of galactic stars and hence a good target for a gc study .",

    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report the gc luminosity function distance of fischer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) of 21.5 mpc",

    "the data for this work was taken using the acs / wfc camera on board the hst as part of proposal i d 9766 ( pi forbes ) .",
    "two pointings along the major axis of ngc 5170 were obtained in the f435w ( b ) and f814w ( i ) filters with a total exposure time of 3720s and 940s at each pointing . a @xmath1500 pixel overlap between the two pointings",
    "gives a final area coverage of about 370@xmath14 @xmath15 210@xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to roughly 40 kpc @xmath15 23 kpc ( for an assumed distance of 22.8 mpc ) , which would emcompass over 90% of the milky way s gc system .",

    "before the initial object detection , we subtracted a smooth model of the galaxy light from the image , using the ellipse task in iraf , to help with object detection and photometric analysis .",
    "daofind was then used to select objects with a threshold 4 times the standard deviation of the background count level for both the b and i images .",
    "an aperture magnitude was measured on all objects using an extraction radius of 5 pixels and a local background level estimated with a 5 pixel wide annulus starting at 20 pixels from the object .",
    "the angular sizes of objects were determined with the latest version of the ishape ( larsen 1999 ) program .",
    "we used empirical psfs , which were constructed for the b and i band mosaics using @xmath16 point sources across the images .",
    "point sources were identified as such using the fwhm calculated from a pass of sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) over each mosaic .",
    "isolated star - like objects with fwhm of 1.82.0 pixels ( see harris 2009a ) were used to construct the empirical psfs for ishape with the standard daophot _ psf _ software routine . again following harris ( 2009a )",
    ", we used a king30 light profile with the default concentration parameter of @xmath17 ( king 1962 ) .",
    "the ellipticity and position angle were allowed to vary during this fit .",
    "the final half light radii ( r@xmath18 ) were used to pick an appropriate aperture correction to derive total magnitudes following harris ( 2009a ) .    before converting the photometry to a standard photometric system",
    ", galactic extinction corrections were applied using e(b ",
    "v ) @xmath19 from the dirbe dust maps ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) and extinction coefficients for a g1-star from sirianni et al .",

    "( 2005 ) including colour terms .",
    "charge transfer efficiency corrections are likely to be negligible in the bright galaxy halo regions of our detected objects , and were not applied .",
    "the b and i band objects were matched in position ( with a 3 pixel tolerance ) to create a common object list of sizes and extinction - corrected photometry .",
    "objects projected on the disk and inner bulge are very difficult to disentangle from star clusters and ob associations , and are problematic when it comes to measuring reliable photometry and sizes .",
    "we opted to apply a spatial cut to exclude the disk and inner bulge regions .",
    "this cut essentially removes a region above and below the ( edge - on ) disk .",
    "it means we may have partially selected against red ( metal - rich ) bulge / disk gcs that may be present , which preferentially lie in these regions .",
    "as the distance to ngc 5170 is quite uncertain , we next applied a ( distance - independent ) colour selection .",
    "we selected only those objects with colours @xmath20 ( b ",
    "i)@xmath12 @xmath21 .",
    "such a selection applied to the milky way would include over 95% of the gc system ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "harris ( 2009a ) has shown that objects with an ishape signal - to - noise ratio of less than 50 , have unreliable size measures .",
    "our data support this conclusion .",
    "we have therefore decided to select only those objects with an i band signal - to - noise ratio greater than 50 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the signal - to - noise ratio tracks the magnitude of an object , so that this selection cut is effectively a magnitude limit of i @xmath22 23 ( which is a few tens of a magnitude brighter than the expected gc turnover magnitude , as discussed below ) .",
    "we note that the b band signal - to - noise ratio closely follows that of the i band ( as the exposure times were chosen to give similar effective depths ) .    at this stage in our selection process",
    ", our object list contains several background galaxies .",
    "the next step in our selection criteria is to use the size as measured by ishape as a means of excluding extended background sources and for identifying _ bona fide _ gcs .",
    "the combination of high spatial resolution imaging from the acs camera and the high galactic latitude of ngc 5170 ensures that the contamination from foreground stars in our final object list is minimal .",
    "nevertheless we applied a _ minimum _",
    "size selection removing @xmath150 objects with half light sizes less than 0.01@xmath14 as these are most likely stars ( see harris 2009a ) .",
    "the half light sizes of gcs are thought to remain relatively stable as a gc evolves ( aarseth & heggie 1998 ) and are found observationally to have a near constant average size in large galaxies ( jordan et al .",
    "2005 ; harris et al .",
    "the latter suggests that comparison of the physical sizes of the objects in ngc 5170 with those of the milky way can be used to further refine our object list .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the size - magnitude distribution of objects assuming a virgo - infall distance of 22.8 mpc .",
    "the plot shows a fairly - well defined locus of objects in ngc 5170 with median sizes @xmath1 3.5 pc , which appear to have slightly larger sizes ( and to be more luminous ) than the bulk of the milky way gc system . a closer distance to ngc 5170",
    "would provide better agreement between the two distributions .",

    "i)@xmath12 = 1.61 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we show the same data but adjust the distance to ngc 5170 to be 19.5 mpc ( this choice of distance is justified below ) . visually the two distributions appear better matched .    in an effort to create a cleaner sample",
    "( i.e. reduce the number of background galaxy contaminants ) we imposed a size limit of r@xmath23 @xmath24 0.05@xmath14 ( 4.7 pc for a distance of 19.5 mpc ) .",
    "the effect of this selection can be seen in fig .",
    "it shows that half a dozen milky way gcs ( including omega cen ) would be excluded , but the vast bulk remain .",
    "we note that the milky way gc system , and other galaxies , reveal a size versus galactocentric distance trend , such that the larger gcs tend to be located at large distances ( van den bergh et al .",
    "1991 ; jordan et al . 2005 ; spitler et al . 2006 ; gomez & woodley 2007 ; harris 2009b ) .",
    "the most distant selected object in our sample is at a projected radius of @xmath115 kpc , compared to the milky way gc system which extends to @xmath1100 kpc .",
    "thus a stricter size selection for ngc 5170 is probably justified .",
    "finally , we conducted a visual inspection of the selected objects .",
    "this was performed independently by two people ( df and js ) .",
    "we attempted to identify objects that we could confidently exclude as being non - gcs on the basis of their visual appearance .",
    "we identified 11 ( df ) and 15 ( js ) objects .",
    "there were 9 objects in common and these were generally classified as small galaxies .",
    "the different classifications tended to occur for the faint objects located near the galaxy disk , i.e. they may be reddened ob assocations .",
    "we have chosen to exclude the combined list of 17 objects .",
    "the small number of visually excluded objects , several of which are at the faint end of our sample , do not affect our conclusions in terms of the colour - magnitude diagram , luminosity function or total population calculations .",
    "our final object list contains 142 candidate gcs .",
    "positions and photometry for these candidate gcs are listed in an on - line table .",
    "the distance of 19.5 mpc used above , was based on the empirical evidence that the average half light radius for gcs is relatively constant from system to system ( jordan et al .",
    "2005 ; harris et al .",
    "2009a ) . to compare the ngc 5170 and milky way gc systems , we first restricted the milky way system to be only those gcs which have m@xmath4 @xmath24 8.5 ( our effective magnitude limit ) and we removed the large , outer gc ngc 2419 with a size of 17.9 pc .",
    "the remaining 56 gcs have a median half light radius of 3.12 pc with an error of @xmath30.20 .",
    "the median half light radius for the final 142 ngc 5170 candidate gcs is 0.033@xmath14 @xmath3 0.001 .",
    "this angular size matches the milky way physical size for a distance of 19.5 @xmath3 1.4 mpc ( m  m = 31.45 ) .",
    "this value is within @xmath12@xmath0 of the hubble flow distance of 22.8 @xmath3 1.6 mpc .",
    "a histogram of the ngc 5170 candidate gcs ( for a distance of 19.5 mpc ) compared to the milky way gc system is shown in fig .",

    "6 shows the spatial distribution of the candidate gcs within our field - of - view of @xmath128 @xmath15 18 kpc ( for a distance of 19.5 mpc ) .",
    "they are concentrated around the galaxy centre indicating that they are indeed associated with ngc 5170 .",
    "our spatial selection avoiding the region @xmath1 @xmath3 1 kpc above and below the disk of the galaxy is clearly seen .",
    "a similar region in the milky way would exclude about 1/3 of the gcs and the vast bulk of starforming regions as the scale height for hii regions is @xmath150 pc ( paladini , davies & de zotti 2004 ) .",
    "we found no significant trend in object size or magnitude with spatial location .",
    "the gcs located near to the galaxy bulge tend to have red colours , otherwise there is no strong colour dependence with spatial location .",
    "we have identified a possible ultra compact dwarf ( i.e. a gc - like object with a large size and high luminosity ) as labelled in the figure .",
    "we discuss this ucd object in more detail in section 6 below .",
    "the observed colour - magnitude diagram for candidate gcs is shown in fig .",

    "the colour - magnitude diagram reveals a concentration of blue objects with colour ( b ",

    "such colours are associated with the metal - poor subpopulation of gcs ( e.g. barmby et al . 2000 ) .",

    "extending to larger galactocentric radii would tend to decrease this fraction , while accounting for missing bulge / disk gcs would tend to increase it .",
    "however , assuming a spatial distribution similar to the milky way s gc system , this fraction will be largely unchanged at 1/3 .    in an attempt to quantify the visual trend for the blue subpopulation to become redder with increasing brightness ,",

    "the blue / red fractions are similar at 53 ( 70% ) to 23 ( 30% ) .",
    "however the mean colour , rms dispersion and error on the mean are now ( b  i)@xmath12 = 1.516 @xmath3 0.115 ( 0.016 ) and 1.771 @xmath3 0.172 ( 0.036 ) . thus there is a marginal 2@xmath0 difference in the mean colour of the red subpopulation with magnitude but the bright blue gcs are redder than the faint blue ones at the @xmath13@xmath0 level . in fig .",
    "7 we overlay the mean value , error on the mean and the rms dispersion for the blue subpopulation .",
    "the colour difference is @xmath25(b ",

    "if we assume a linear transformation from colour to metallicity of the form @xmath25(b  i)/@xmath25[fe / h ] = 0.375 ( harris et al .",

    "7 of colour bimodality with a blue tilt and no strong evidence of a red tilt .",
    "we note that the appearance of the blue tilt does not depend strongly on the exact choice of a maximum size criterion nor on the region excluded above and below the disk .    in fig .",

    "the universal peak of the gc luminosity function occurs at m@xmath4 @xmath1 8.3 , which is fainter than the cutoff magnitude of our data .",

    "thus spatially we detect almost half of the total gc system .",
    "if ngc 5170 were located at a distance 10% further ( closer ) then the number found would decrease ( increase ) by about 4 ( 3% ) gcs .",
    "the change in the number of gcs is relatively insensitive to distance as any increase in the area of the halo searched is compensated for by the size of the disk region that is excluded .      in order to estimate the magnitude completeness of our sample",

    "these simulated sources were fully calibrated onto the standard johnson photometric system in a similar manner to the actual gc candidates with an intrinsic colour of b  i = 1.7 imposed .",
    "we ensured that none of the simulated sources were placed near gc candidates and we avoided the disk region but otherwise sources were distributed at random on the image .",
    "we used daofind with the same detection parameters to recover the simulated sources .",
    "our tests suggest that we are 100% complete at our cutoff magnitude of i @xmath1 23 .",
    "this corresponds to m@xmath4 @xmath1 8.5 , and hence we have not quite reached the expected gc luminosity function turnoff at m@xmath4 @xmath1 8.3 .",
    "in other words , we have detected slightly less than half of the gc system in terms of magnitude .      as stated above",
    ", we expect contamination from foreground stars in our final object list to be minimal .",
    "as the surface density of objects declines with galactocentric distance , and our spatial coverage is a fraction of the milky way gc system extent , the number of unresolved background galaxies with colours matching those of gcs is likely to be very small . from our visual inspection of the images , we suspect that the main source of any contamination is misclassified starforming regions ( combined with some internal reddening to produce colours similar to a gc ) located close to the galaxy disk .",
    "if as many as half of the 26 objects with 1 @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath24 2 kpc of the galaxy disk are actually starforming regions , then the resulting uncertainty on our final object list of 142 is 9% .",
    "this gives a first order estimate of the uncertainty associated with misclassified starforming regions .",
    "it is also possible that _ bona fide _ gcs have been reddened sufficiently by internal dust so as to shift their colours beyond our red limit , i.e. ( b  i)@xmath12 @xmath26 2.2 .",
    "however the small relative number of red ( ( b ",
    "i)@xmath12 @xmath1 1.9 ) gcs that we detect suggests that reddening of intrinsically blue gcs is a minor effect .    in order to calculate the total gc system of ngc 5170",

    "this can be compared to the gc system numbers derived by fischer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) of 815 @xmath3 320 and s@xmath30 = 1.3 for an assumed distance of 31.6 mpc and m@xmath13 = 22.0 .",
    "our acs imaging field includes a bright object which is excluded from our final gc list .",
    "its magnitude i@xmath12 = 19.00 and its size of 0.065@xmath14 ( in both b and i filters ) corresponds to are m@xmath4 = 12.45 and r@xmath23 = 6.14 pc for a distance of 19.5 mpc .",
    "it has a relatively red colour ( b ",
    "i)@xmath12 = 1.89 and it appears quite round in the acs images .",

    "= 17:59:09.1 ( j2000 ) , se of the galaxy disk ( see figures 1 and 5 ) . a recession velocity is needed to confirm its association with ngc 5170 .",
    "whether this object should be classified as a massive gc or an ultra compact dwarf is a matter of debate .",
    "the properties of objects classified as ucds overlap with those that have been classified as massive gcs ( e.g. forbes et al . 2008 ) . indeed the properties of the object described above lie within the range of those found for gcs in the rich gc systems studied by harris ( 2009a ) .",
    "so although the object is clearly distinct from the bulk of the ngc 5170 gcs in terms of its luminosity , it is still consistent with being drawn from a ( universal ) gc luminosity function .",
    "mieske et al .",
    "( 2006b ) have suggested that a gc / ucd transition occurs at m@xmath13 @xmath1 11 ( m@xmath4 @xmath1 12 ) or a few million solar masses , as this marks the change from a near constant size to one that scales with luminosity .",
    "( mieske et al . 2006b ; forbes et al . 2008 ) . by this definition ,",
    "the ngc 5170 object would be classified as a ucd .",
    "using two pointings of the hst / acs camera , in the b and i filters , we have explored the gc system surrounding the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 5170 .",
    "we employed the aperture - correction method of harris ( 2009a ) for partially resolved objects to obtain accurate total magnitudes .",
    "the initial selection of candidate gcs is based on ( b  i)@xmath12 colour and signal - to - noise ratio ( which closely tracks magnitude ) .",
    "we used the object size , as measured by ishape , to further refine the selection process and to provide an estimate of the distance to ngc 5170 ( under the assumption of a universal average size for gcs ) .",
    "this distance is 19.5 mpc and is within @xmath12@xmath0 of the hubble flow distance .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram reveals a well - populated blue subpopulation and a sparse red subpopulation , in a ratio of roughly 3 to 1 .",
    "the gc subpopulation colours are similar to those seen in the milky way and m31 gc systems .",
    "we also find a blue tilt that is similar , within our restricted magnitude range , to that for massive ellipticals found by harris ( 2009a ) and to the self enrichment model described in harris et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "these findings suggest that normal late - type spiral galaxies , along with galaxies of earlier types , host gc systems with a blue tilt .",
    "the blue tilts are most likely evidence for a mass - metallicity relation within the metal - poor gc subpopulation .",
    "the reason for the lack of an observed blue tilt in the milky way gc system appears to be simply due to the small number of relatively massive gcs ( bailin & harris 2009 ; harris 2009a ) .",
    "we would expect that new , high precision photometry of a large sample of the m31 gc system should reveal a blue tilt .",
    "we note that the reality of blue tilts in general has been disputed by kundu ( 2008 ) , and in the case of m87 in particular by waters et al .",
    "subsequent work by harris ( 2009a ,",
    "b ) , peng et al . ( 2009 ) and madrid et al . ( 2009 ) has addressed the issues raised by these workers and has strongly confirmed the astrophysical reality of blue tilts .",
    "although of similar hubble type and total magnitude to the milky way ( sbc , m@xmath13 @xmath1 21.3 ) , we find that the gc system of ngc 5170 is much richer with a total gc population of 600 @xmath3 100 gcs . in this sense",
    "ngc 5170 bears more resemblance to the sb galaxy m31 with @xmath1450 gcs ( barmby et al .",
    "2000 ) , or the sa sombrero galaxy with 1900 gcs ( rhode & zepf 2004 ) .",
    "a commonly - used measure to directly compare gc systems is the specific frequency s@xmath30 , which normalises gc number by m@xmath13 .",
    "assuming m@xmath13 = 21.6 for ngc 5170 , we estimate s@xmath30 = 1.37 @xmath3 0.23 .",
    "this is higher than the local group spirals ( i.e. for the milky way s@xmath30 = 0.6 and m31 s@xmath30 = 0.9 ) and the four sb - sc spirals studied by rhode et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who found a range of 0.5 @xmath24 s@xmath30 @xmath24 0.9 , but less than s@xmath30 = 2.1 for the sombrero galaxy ( rhode & zepf 2004 ) .",
    "an alternative measure for comparing gc systems is the stellar mass normalised gc frequency , t@xmath30 ( rhode & zepf 2004 ; spitler et al . 2008 ) . using the 2mass k band magnitude of 7.63 and a salpeter imf we derive a stellar mass of 7.6 @xmath15 10@xmath31 m@xmath32 .",
    "this gives t@xmath30 @xmath1 8 .",
    "however this likely an upper limit given that some fraction of the k band flux will be obscured due to the highly edge - on ( @xmath8 @xmath1 86@xmath9 ) nature of ngc 5170 .",
    "spitler et al . showed that t@xmath30 varies with the stellar mass of the host , and that the sombrero galaxy had the highest t@xmath30 value ( @xmath1 9 ) of the 8 spiral galaxies listed .",
    "thus ngc 5170 appears to have a high gc frequency , placing it between the local group spirals and the sombrero galaxy .    using the scaling relation of spitler & forbes ( 2009 ) between total gc system mass with halo mass",
    ", we estimate a halo mass for ngc 5170 to be 3.4 @xmath15 10@xmath33 m@xmath32 .",
    "this is a factor of 2 - 3@xmath15 that of the milky way halo mass .",
    "we also report the discovery of a possible ultra compact dwarf associated with ngc 5170 .",
    "if confirmed by its radial velocity , it will be another rare example of a ucd located near a spiral galaxy outside that of a galaxy cluster ( see hau et al .",
