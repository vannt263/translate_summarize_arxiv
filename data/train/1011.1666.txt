    "when a narrow band gap semiconductor is excited with intense femtosecond laser pulses , a dense electron - hole plasma is produced due to the promotion of electrons from bonding states to anti - bonding states , which can cause large changes in bond lengths leading to possible structural transitions @xcite .",
    "the photo - excitation of carriers changes the equilibrium positions of the atoms ; the atoms then oscillate around their new equilibrium positions , a mechanism called as displacive excitation of coherent phonons ( decp ) @xcite .",
    "thus , decp is the dominant mechanism in opaque samples @xcite compared to impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( isrs ) @xcite in transparent materials .",
    "later , it was shown that decp is a special case of isrs when excited resonantly @xcite .",
    "the investigations of coherent phonons performed under high photo - excited carrier density ( pcd ) @xmath8",
    "10@xmath9 @xmath6 have been very few till now @xcite .",
    "in tellurium , time resolved reflectivity experiments @xcite performed using 100 fs pulses at a pcd of @xmath10 @xmath6 showed an instantaneous large red shift ( 13% ) of @xmath11 coherent phonon frequency , attributed to the electronic softening or bond weakening @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phonon time period decreasing with the delay time between the pump and probe pulses corresponds to an asymmetric line shape in frequency domain .",
    "this linear sweep in the frequency with the pump - probe time delay , termed as phonon chirping , originates from the rapid change of photoexcited carrier density across the sample thickness due to carrier diffusion resulting in different amounts of phonon renormalization @xcite . in case of a semimetal , bismuth @xcite at carrier density of @xmath2 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6 in a degenerate pump - probe reflectivity experiment done at room temperature , a@xmath3 coherent phonons",
    "were also found to be positively chirped with large oscillation amplitudes of @xmath2 0.13   @xcite .",
    "further , collapse and revival of chirped coherent phonon oscillations were observed in the reflectivity data when the carrier density was increased further beyond a critical carrier density levels ( 3.5 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6 at 10k and 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6 at 296k ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior was explained in terms of dynamics of a phonon wave packet in an anharmonic potential , where the packet periodically breaks up and revives to its original form , implying a nonclassical dynamics .",
    "a detailed first principle density functional calculations and optical double pump pulse experiments show that the anharmonic contribution to the phonon period is negligible under such high pump fluence regime in bismuth @xcite and tellurium @xcite and time dependence of carrier plasma density alone is able to explain the observed softening of the phonons .",

    "the modes seen at 1.85 thz and 4.02 thz were assigned to two allowed a@xmath3 modes , in agreement with conventional raman measurements @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to study coherent phonons in single crystal of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 as a function of temperature ( from 296 k to 3 k ) at high photoexcited carrier densities , with a view ( i ) to understand the assignment of the high frequency coherent mode ( first order _ vis _ a _ vis _ second order ) and ( ii ) to study phonon chirping .",
    "the gabor wavelet transform has been performed on time domain data to study the evolution of the coherent phonon modes .",
    "we note that earlier studies on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite were done only at room temperature and low pump fluences ( with negligible chirping ) .",
    "a single crystal of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ( 6 @xmath4 6 @xmath4 0.5 mm@xmath13 ) with a cleaved surface perpendicular to the trigonal axis mounted on a continuous helium flow cryostat was used in our experiments .",

    "the pump beam was modulated at 393 hz with a chopper and the reflected probe intensity was recorded using a si - pin diode and a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the spot size ( half width at 1/e maximum ) of the pump and probe beams were kept at @xmath2 600 @xmath14 m and 400 @xmath14 m , respectively at the overlap of the two beams on the sample .",
    "the pulse width was measured to be 65  fs ( full width at half maximum ) using a thin beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal at the sample point .",
    "the polarization of the pump beam was kept perpendicular to that of the probe beam to avoid scattered pump light reaching the detector . both the pump and probe beams were kept close to normal incidence .",
    "the crystal surface is seen to get damaged at pump fluence beyond @xmath2 4.5 mj/@xmath12 and hence all our experiments were done at pump fluences of 3.3 mj/@xmath12 and 1.3 mj/@xmath12 , whereas the probe fluence was kept at 0.4 mj/@xmath12 .",
    "the time resolved reflectivity of the sample was recorded as a function of sample temperature varying from 296k to 3k .",

    ". it may be very difficult to see the chirping effect in time domain as the higher frequency mode is very short lived ( 1.2 ps ) and therefore , frequency domain is a better choice in identifying the chirp in such cases .",

    "this inverse power law dependence suggests that at low temperatures , the diffusion time is longer and hence electron phonon interaction will result in large chirping .",
    "the temperature dependence of chirping as @xmath56 needs new theoretical inputs .",

    "the raman cross - section increases with temperature as [ @xmath59 ( where n(@xmath60 ) is the bose - einstein statistical factor ) and hence the raman peak intensity can be written as , i@xmath30 @xmath61}{[2 n(\\nu/2)+1]}$ ] , where the temperature dependence in the denominator comes from the cubic anharmonic contributions to the linewidth .",

    "the behavior of the second mode is rather interesting : the damping constant becomes almost constant after 60k and the frequency decreases from 4.0 thz to 3.6 thz ( 10@xmath64 change ) when the crystal temperature increases from 3k to 296k .",
    "the fit ( thick line ) shown in the figure is by using the well known functions @xcite based on cubic anharmonicity where the phonon of frequency , @xmath60 decays into two phonons of equal frequency : @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] where @xmath35 ( frequency at t=0k ) , a , c and @xmath67 ( disorder induced damping ) are the fitting parameters ( a and c are the measures of third order cubic anharmonicity ) .",

    "[ bite_fig3](h ) that the temperature dependence of @xmath68 is non - monotonic .",
    "the decrease of @xmath68 at 3k may be due to the chirp in the frequency whose quantitative understanding is lacking .    finally , to examine whether the second mode at @xmath2 4 thz is the second harmonic of the first a@xmath3 mode at 1.8 thz as suggested in ref @xcite , we re - fitted the digitally band pass filtered time domain data with @xmath69 expressed in a second order approximation in q as @xcite @xmath70~q + \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg[\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta r / r)}{\\partial   q^2}\\bigg]~q^2\\ ] ] where q is for the a@xmath37 phonon mode . taking the expression for q as in eq .",
