    "<S> we present the results of our spectroscopic observations of eight detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) , selected from the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog . radial velocities ( rvs ) </S>",
    "<S> were calculated from high resolution spectra obtained with the hides spectrograph , attached to the 1.88-m telescope of the okayama astrophysical observatory , and were used to characterize the targets in combination with the _ kepler _ light curves . for each binary </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a full set of orbital and physical parameters , reaching precision below 3% in masses and radii for 5 pairs . by comparing our results with theoretical models , </S>",
    "<S> we assess the distance , age and evolutionary status of the researched objects . </S>",
    "<S> we also study eclipse timing variations of selected objects , and identify a new system with a @xmath0dor pulsator . </S>",
    "<S> two systems are triples , and show lines coming from three components . in one case the motion of the outer star and the perturbation in the rvs of the inner binary are clearly visible and periodical , which allows us to directly calculate the mass of the third star , and inclination of the outer orbit . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> we only see a clear motion of the tertiary , and investigate two scenarios : that it is a linear trend coming from the orbital motion around the inner binary , and that it is caused by a planetary mass companion . </S>",
    "<S> when possible , we also compare our results with the literature , and conclude that only by combining photometry with rvs it is possible to obtain correct physical parameters of both components of a deb .    </S>",
