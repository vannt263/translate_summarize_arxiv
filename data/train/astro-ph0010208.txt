    ". this can be done by ( 1 ) identify an emission feature and nearby continuum bands , ( 2 ) construct a color temperature map from the continuum images , ( 3 ) synthesize a continuum image at the feature wavelength from the temperature map taking into account diffraction effects , and ( 4 ) subtract the synthesized continuum - only map from the observed feature band image .",

    "3 shows that the 10.3 and 18.0@xmath4 m bands have different spatial distributions , indicating that these emissions are due to different carrier species .",
    "we thus need to find a dust species with an emission feature at 18@xmath4 m but not at 10.3@xmath4 m ( i.e. , not silicates ) .",

    "+          observation of the differences listed above suggests that the difference between the two bands may arise from the availability of hydrogen , either in the form of an atom or an out - of - plane c - h stretch .",
    "the former implies the difference in the ionization state of pahs ( i.e. , the 8.6@xmath4 m emission is from the ionized shell and the 11.2@xmath4 m emission is from the photo dissociation region ) , while the latter suggests different structure of pahs ( i.e. , the 8.6@xmath4 m emission is from pah clusters and the @xmath7 m emission is from chain- or sheet - like pahs ) .",
