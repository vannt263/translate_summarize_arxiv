    "multi - user mimo techniques such as zero - forcing beamforming allow for simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams even when each receiver ( mobile ) has only a single antenna , but very accurate channel state information ( csi ) is generally required at the transmitter in order to utilize such techniques . in the practically motivated _ finite rate feedback _ model ,",
    "each mobile feeds back a finite number of bits describing its channel realization at the beginning of each block or frame . in the _ vector _ downlink channel ( multiple transmit antennas , single antenna at each receiver ) ,",
    "the feedback bits are determined by quantizing the channel vector to one of @xmath0 quantization vectors .",
    "while a relatively small number of feedback bits suffice to obtain near - perfect csit performance in a point - to - point vector / miso ( multiple - input , single - output ) channel @xcite , considerably more feedback is required in a vector downlink channel .",
    "if zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) is used , the feedback rate must be scaled with the number of transmit antennas as well as snr in order to achieve rates close to perfect csit systems @xcite .",
    "in such a system the transmitter emits multiple beams and uses its channel knowledge to select beamforming vectors such that nulls are created at certain users .",
    "inaccurate csi leads to inaccurate nulling and thus translates directly into multi - user interference and reduced sinr / throughput .    in this paper",
    "we consider the mimo downlink channel , in which the transmitter and each mobile have multiple antennas ( @xmath1 transmit antennas , @xmath2 antennas per mobile ) , in the same limited feedback setting .",
    "we propose a receive antenna combining technique , dubbed _ quantization - based combining _",
    "( qbc ) , that converts the mimo downlink into a vector downlink in such a way that the system is able to operate with reduced channel feedback . each mobile linearly combines its @xmath2 antenna outputs and thereby creates a single antenna channel .",
    "the resulting vector channel is quantized and fed back , and transmission is then performed as in a normal vector downlink channel .    with qbc",
    "the combiner weights are chosen on the basis of both the channel and the vector quantization codebook to produce the effective single antenna channel that can be quantized most accurately .",
    "on the other hand , traditional combining techniques such as the maximum - ratio based technique that is optimal for point - to - point mimo channels with limited channel feedback @xcite or direct quantization of the maximum eigenmode are aimed towards maximization of received signal power but generally do not minimize channel quantization error .",
    "since channel quantization error is so critical in the mimo downlink channel , quantization - based combining leads to better performance by minimizing quantization error ( i.e. , interference power ) possibly at the expense of channel ( i.e. , signal ) power .",
    "one way to view the advantage of qbc is through its reduced feedback requirements relative to the vector downlink channel . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that scaling ( per mobile ) feedback as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the snr , suffices to maintain a maximum gap of 3 db ( equivalent to 1 bps / hz per mobile ) between perfect csit and limited feedback performance in a vector downlink channel employing zfbf .",
    "with qbc , our analysis shows that the same throughput ( 3 db away from a vector downlink with perfect csit ) can be achieved if feedback is scaled at the slower rate of @xmath5 . in other words",
    ", qbc allows a mimo downlink to mimic vector downlink performance with reduced channel feedback .",
    "alternatively , qbc can be thought of as an effective method to utilize multiple receive antennas in a downlink channel in the presence of limited channel feedback .",
    "although it is possible to send multiple streams to each mobile if receive combining is not performed , this requires even more feedback from each mobile than a single - stream approach .",
    "in addition , qbc has the advantage that the transmitter need not be aware of the number of receive antennas being used .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - system ] we introduce the system model and some preliminaries . in section [ sec - selection ]",
    "we describe a simple antenna selection method that leads directly into section [ sec - quantization ] where the much more powerful quantization - based combining technique is described in detail . in section [ sec - tput ] we analyze the throughput and feedback requirements of qbc . in section [ sec - compare ]",
    "we compare qbc to alternative mimo downlink techniques , and finally we conclude in section [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a @xmath6 mobile ( receiver ) downlink channel in which the transmitter ( access point ) has @xmath1 antennas , and each of the mobiles has @xmath2 antennas .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath7-th antenna is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the channel vectors ( with @xmath10 ) describing the @xmath11 receive antennas , @xmath12 is the transmitted vector , and @xmath13 are independent complex gaussian noise terms with unit variance .",

    "we consider a block fading channel with iid rayleigh fading from block to block , i.e. , the channel coefficients are iid complex gaussian with unit variance .",
    "each of the mobiles is assumed to have perfect knowledge of its own channel @xmath19 , although we analyze the effect of relaxing this assumption in section [ sec - rx_error ] . in this work",
    "we study only the _ ergodic capacity _ , or the long - term average throughput .",
    "furthermore , we only consider systems for which @xmath20 because qbc is not very useful if @xmath21 ; this point is briefly discussed in section [ sec - quantization ] .      in the finite rate feedback model ,",
    "each mobile quantizes its channel to @xmath22 bits and feeds back the bits perfectly and instantaneously to the transmitter at the beginning of each block @xcite@xcite .",
    "vector quantization is performed using a codebook @xmath23 of @xmath0 @xmath1-dimensional unit norm vectors @xmath24 , and each mobile quantizes its channel to the quantization vector that forms the minimum angle to it @xcite @xcite : @xmath25    for analytical tractability , we study systems using _ random vector quantization _ ( rvq ) in which each of the @xmath0 quantization vectors is independently chosen from the isotropic distribution on the @xmath1-dimensional unit sphere and where each mobile uses an independently generated codebook @xcite .",
    "we analyze performance averaged over random codebooks ; similar to shannon s random coding argument , there always exists at least one quantization codebook that performs as well as the ensemble average .      after receiving the quantization indices from each of the mobiles ,",

    "if all multi - user interference is treated as additional noise and equal power loading is used , the resulting sinr at the @xmath14-th receiver is given by : @xmath36 the coefficient that determines the amount of interference received at mobile @xmath14 from the beam intended for mobile @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is easily seen to be an increasing function of mobile @xmath14 s quantization error .    in the above expression we have assumed that @xmath1 mobiles are randomly selected for transmission and that equal power is allocated to each mobile . however , the throughput of zero - forcing based mimo downlink channels can be significantly increased by transmitting to an intelligently selected subset of mobiles @xcite . in order to maximize throughput ,",
    "users with nearly orthogonal channels and with large channel magnitudes are selected , and waterfilling can be performed across the channels of the selected users . in @xcite a low - complexity greedy algorithm that selects users and performs waterfilling is proposed .",
    "if this algorithm is used , a zero - forcing based system can come quite close to the true sum capacity of the mimo downlink , even for a moderate number of users .",
    "in @xcite the vector downlink channel ( @xmath26 ) is analyzed assuming that equal power zfbf is performed without user selection on the basis of finite rate feedback ( with rvq ) .",
    "the basic result of @xcite is that : @xmath39 \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the ergodic per - user throughput with feedback and with perfect csit , respectively , and the quantity @xmath42 $ ] is the expected quantization error .",
    "the expected quantization error can be accurately upper bounded by @xmath43 and therefore the throughput loss due to limited feedback is upper bounded by @xmath44 , which is an increasing function of the snr @xmath4 . if the number of feedback bits ( per mobile ) is scaled with @xmath4 according to : @xmath45 then the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is upper bounded by @xmath46 bps / hz at all snr s , or equivalently the power gap is at most 3 db . as the remainder of the paper shows ,",
    "quantization - based combining significantly reduces the quantization error ( more precisely , it increases the exponential rate at which quantization error goes to zero as @xmath22 is increased ) and therefore decreases the rate at which @xmath22 must be increased as a function of snr .",
    "in this section we describe a simple antenna selection method that reduces channel quantization error",
    ". description of this technique is primarily included for expository reasons , because the simple concept of antenna selection naturally extends to the more complex ( and powerful ) qbc technique . in point - to - point mimo",
    ", antenna selection corresponds to choosing the receive antenna with the largest channel gain , while in the mimo downlink the receive antenna that can be vector quantized with minimal angular error is selected .",
    "mobile 1 , which has channel matrix @xmath47 $ ] and a single quantization codebook consisting of @xmath48 quantization vectors @xmath49 , first individually quantizes each of its @xmath2 vector channels @xmath50 @xmath51 and then selects the antenna with the minimum quantization error : @xmath52 and feeds back the quantization index corresponding to @xmath53 .",
    "the mobile uses only antenna @xmath37 for reception , and thus the system is effectively transformed into a vector downlink channel .    due to the independence of the channel and quantization vectors , choosing the best of @xmath2 channel quantizations is statistically equivalent to quantizing a single vector channel using a codebook of size @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , antenna selection effectively increases the quantization codebook size from @xmath48 to @xmath54 , and thus the system achieves the same throughput as a vector downlink with @xmath55 feedback bits . although not negligible , this advantage is much smaller than that provided by quantization - based combining .",
    "in this section we describe the quantization - based combining ( qbc ) technique that reduces channel quantization error by appropriately combining receive antenna outputs .",
    "we consider a linear combiner at each mobile , which effectively converts each multiple antenna mobile into a single antenna receiver . the combiner structure for a 3 user channel with 3 transmit antennas ( @xmath56 ) and 2 antennas per mobile ( @xmath57 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - effective ] .",
    "each mobile linearly combines its @xmath2 outputs , using appropriately chosen combiner weights , to produce a scalar output ( denoted by @xmath58 ) .",
    "the effective channel describing the channel from the transmit antenna array to the effective output of the @xmath14-th mobile ( @xmath58 ) is simply a linear combination of the @xmath2 vectors describing the @xmath2 receive antennas . after choosing combining weights",
    "the mobile quantizes the effective channel vector and feeds back the appropriate quantization index .",
    "only the effective channel output is used to receive data , and thus each mobile effectively has only one antenna .",
    "the key to the technique is to _ choose combiner weights that produce an effective channel that can be quantized very accurately _ ; such a choice must be made on the basis of both the channel vectors and the quantization codebook .",
    "this is quite different from maximum ratio combining , where the combiner weights and quantization vector are chosen such that received signal power is maximized but quantization error is generally not minimized .",
    "note that antenna selection corresponds to choosing the effective channel from the @xmath2 columns of @xmath59 , while qbc allows for any linear combination of these @xmath2 column vectors .",
    "let us consider the effective received signal at the first mobile for some choice of combiner weights , which we denote as @xmath60 .",
    "in order to maintain a noise variance of one , the combiner weights are constrained to have unit norm : @xmath61 .",
    "the ( scalar ) combiner output , denoted @xmath62 , is : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is unit variance complex gaussian because @xmath65 .",
    "the effective channel vector @xmath66 is simply a linear combination of the vectors @xmath67 : @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 can be any unit norm vector , @xmath66 can be in any direction in the @xmath2-dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath70 , i.e. , in span@xmath71 .",

    "the error corresponding to effective channel @xmath66 is @xmath72 therefore , the optimal choice of the effective channel is the solution to : @xmath73 where @xmath66 is allowed to be in any direction in span@xmath71 .",
    "once the optimal effective channel is determined , the combiner weights @xmath69 can be determined through a simple pseudo - inverse operation .",
    "since the expression for the optimum effective channel given in ( [ eq - double_min ] ) consists of two minimizations , without loss of optimality the order of the minimization can be switched to give : @xmath74 for each quantization vector @xmath75 , the inner minimization finds the effective channel vector in span@xmath71 that forms the minimum angle with @xmath75 . by basic geometric principles ,",

    "therefore , each quantization vector has zero angle with the channel subspace and as a result the solution to the inner minimization in ( [ eq - double_minb ] ) is trivially zero for each @xmath75 .",

    ", the solution of ( [ eq - double_minb ] ) , is the vector that forms the smallest angle between itself and span@xmath71 .",

    "first we find the vector @xmath86 such that @xmath87 , and then scale to get @xmath88 .",

    "the zf - csit curve is shown because it serves as an upper bound on the performance of qbc , and the gap between the two is quite reasonable even for @xmath213 .",
    "met - fb is seen to perform extremely poorly : this is not too surprising because the met algorithm is likely to only choose the strongest eigenmode of a few users @xcite , and thus half of the feedback is essentially wasted on quantization of each user s weakest eigenmode .",
    "this motivates dedicating all 10 bits to quantization of the strongest eigenmode , but note that this essentially corresponds to mrc , which is outperformed by qbc .",
    "the huge gap between met - csit and met - fb indicates that met has the potential to provide excellent performance , but extremely high levels of feedback may be necessary to realize met s potential .",
