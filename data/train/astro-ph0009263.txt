    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and some x - ray binaries are thought to be powered by accretion onto massive black holes ( e.g. rees 1984 ; tanaka 2000 ) .",
    "observations suggest that cold matter in the accretion engine reprocesses the primary x - ray continuum ( e.g. george and fabian 1991 ) .",
    "in particular , a fluorescent iron k@xmath0 emission line profile is imprinted on the spectrum near 6.4 kev .",
    "the iron line profile is shaped by doppler and gravitational frequency shifts ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , and hence contains information about geometry and dynamics in the innermost regions of the accretion engine ( see fabian et al .",
    "2000 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "most modelling of iron line profiles has been carried out within the paradigm of geometrically thin , optically thick discs .",
    "the initial flat disc model of fabian et al .",
    "( 1989 ) was generalised to kerr black holes by laor ( 1991 ) . more recently ,",
    "pariev and bromley ( 1998 ) have considered effects of a small disc thickness and turbulence .",
    "thin disc line profiles successfully reproduce many features in the experimental data ( e.g. tanaka et al . 1995 ; nandra et al .",
    "however there are some observations which remain difficult to understand within this paradigm .",
    "for example , a preference for low inclinations , even amongst seyfert 2s ( turner et al .",
    "1998 ) , disagreements between the predicted inclination from iron line modelling and the predicted inclination from other phenomena ( nishiura et al . 1998 ; sulentic et al .",
    "1998a ; wang et al .",
    "1999 ) , and problems with the observed reprocessed fraction being too low or not correlated with line width ( e.g. lee et al . 2000 ; chiang et al .",
    "2000 ; weaver 2000 ; sulentic et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "such puzzles may be resolved within the paradigm of thin discs , for instance by introducing additional emission components from an obscuring torus ( weaver and reynolds 1998 ) or invoking flared or warped discs in which the inner and outer regions are not aligned ( blackman 1999 ; hartnoll and blackman 2000 ) . in any case ,",
    "alternative plausible geometries still merit exploration to provide proper diagnostics for comparison .",
    "a particularly interesting alternative extends from work on the survival of cold clouds capable of reprocessing x - ray flux in the agn engines ( e.g. ferland and rees 1988 ; guilbert and rees 1988 ; celotti , fabian and rees 1992 ) . physical constraints on the size of the dense clouds have been studied by kuncic et al .",
    "they found a sizeable parameter regime in which cool , dense , small clouds can coexist with a hot medium in a dynamical equilibrium .",
    "though x - ray continuum features of the embedded cloud model have been studied by several authors ( sivron and tsuruta 1993 ; bond and matsuoka 1993 ; nandra and george 1994 ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 ) , detailed calculations of reprocessed line profiles have not been carried out .",
    "karas et al . (",
    "2000 ) have studied line emission from reprocessing by a nearly spherical shell of clouds at a specific radius that results from a standard thin disc being disrupted due to instabilities .",
    "they give resulting line profiles from illumination by a central source .",
    "this is a different scenario from what we will consider here .",
    "other related calculations of note include cao and zhang ( 1991 ) , who calculated line profiles for radially infalling gas .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the ( iron ) line profiles that result from various distributions of small , cold clouds embedded in an optically thin , geometrically thick accretion disc or corona . as well as illumination from a central source , we include an illumination by an ` x - ray bath ' of radiation ; each cloud is taken to be small enough to be illuminated isotropically at their positional location by this bath component .",
    "this two component illumination is motivated from considering geometrical thick models such as , for example , advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) ( e.g. rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan and yi 1994 ; see narayan et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) , which can be interpreted to have a synchrotron + bremsstrahlung centrally dominated illumination ( mahadevan 1997 ) and a bremsstrahlung x - ray bath .",
    "depending on the accretion rate of the disc , the synchrotron or bremsstrahlung will dominate .",
    "adafs predict luminosities significantly less than the eddington value @xmath1 , and may just be applicable to seyferts , with typical luminosities @xmath2 .",
    "we will use several flow solutions to prescribe a velocity field for the clouds ; standard full adaf solutions , pure radial infall , and bipolar outflows .",
    "the profiles calculated may also therefore be relevant for the dynamics of convection dominated accretion flows ( cdafs ) ( quataert and gruzinov 2000 ; narayan et al .",
    "2000 ) , advection dominated inflow outflow models ( adios ) ( blandford and begelman 1999 ) or other thick disc models .",
    "the microphysics of the direct x - ray line emission for adafs have been studied in non - relativistic flows ( e.g. narayan and raymond 1999 ; perna et al . 2000 ) , but not the presence of cold reprocessing matter , nor the associated relativistic iron flourescence line profiles .",
    "like karas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we take the clouds to be optically thick , and allow the clouds to shadow emission from other clouds .",
    "some profiles for relativistic outflows have been calculated by wang et al .",
    "these outflows are different from those considered here in that they are pencil beams along the spin axis and not radial outflow in a geometrically thick disc .",
    "the spherical geometry , and covering by clouds , can avoid the large blue shifted component that has not been observed in iron lines and that is characteristic of outflows .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. nandra 2000 ) that a geometrically thick distribution of clouds would result in more blue - shifted emission than is observed .",
    "the data from a variety of sources are also not inconsistent with a somewhat larger blue wing ( nandra et al .",
    "but we find that because models of geometrically thick discs can generally have smaller bulk velocities in the central regions than the flat disc keplerian velocities , smaller doppler blue shifts result , and gravitational redshift becomes the dominant spectral feature .",
    "for these reasons also , the line profiles for thick discs will in general be less inclination dependent than those from thin discs .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "it may help explain problems encountered with inclinations in thin disc modelling .",
    "when the velocities are faster , the profiles are very similar to the standard profiles obtained from thin disc modelling .    in section 2",
    "we describe the disc model of dense clouds in geometrically thick discs .",
    "section 3 contains the calculation of iron line profiles from this model .",
    "section 4 presents the resulting line profiles and a discussion of the main features .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "the model consists of small optically thick clouds embedded in , and hence following , the fluid flow in an otherwise optically thin disc .",
    "although the clouds may have a short lifetime , the continuous creation and destruction of clouds allows the definition of an effective number density of clouds at each point , @xmath3 .",
    "we consider these clouds to be both bathed in an locally isotropic radiative flux ( e.g. bremsstrahlung ) and to be illuminated by a central source ( e.g. synchrotron dominated ) .",
    "the clouds are assumed to be small compared to disc length scales ( see celotti et al .",
    "1992 and kuncic et al .",
    "1996 for partial justification ) .    calculating",
    "the profile then involves an optical depth calculation ; we integrate the number density times the cross section along the photon trajectories to obtain a probability of obscuration .",
    "contributions are integrated across the whole disc to obtain a profile , as is done for the usual thin disc , except that now we are integrating over three dimensions .",
    "we consider several different solutions to the accretion flow involving optically thin , geometrically thick engines : self - similar adafs ( narayan and yi 1995 ; perna et al .",
    "2000 ) , bipolar outflows ( xu and chen 1997 ; perna et al .",

    "we take the velocity of clouds to trace the velocity of the fluid in the disc .",
    "this is given by one of the disc motions described in the previous section .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume that all of the clouds are spherical .",
    "the cross section is then independent of a photon s direction of approach .",
    "if we consider clouds with the same total number of particles , this allows us to to write a ( ) v^ ( ) , where @xmath74 is the number density of particles in the cloud .",
    "thermal equilibrium gives a relation between the number density of particles in the cloud and the number density of particles in the disc , @xmath75 , n_p , c ( ) = , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the temperatures of protons in the disc and the clouds , respectively .",
    "we take the temperature of the clouds to be the same everywhere - around @xmath78k ( kuncic et al , 1996 ) , although the actual value will be absorbed into an overall constant - and find the temperature of the disc from the sound speed , @xmath6 , as t ( ) = , where @xmath79 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath80 is the mass of the proton .",
    "this gives us the cross section a ( ) ^ ^. we take @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the solutions of the previous section .",
    "the expression should be normalised by the cross section of the clouds being around @xmath83 @xmath84 at the innermost radius ( kuncic et al . , 1996 ) , however in practice we can absorb this constant into the constant @xmath85 , defined below .",
    "the various assumptions above about the cloud structure ( constant number of particles , constant temperature ) result in clouds with size growing strongly with @xmath44 , as @xmath86 . combined with the radial dependence of the flux emission ( discussed in more detail below ) , this results in profiles dominated by the outer disc regions .",
    "we also want to consider more general radial dependencies , where profiles are dominated by the central regions .",
    "we therefore add the term @xmath87 , to the cloud cross section , where generally @xmath88 is a small positive number .",
    "this has a somewhat analogous rle to the @xmath89 term in the standard thin disc models ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , although has a physically different origin .",
    "the final expression is then a ( ) ^ r^-g .",
    "we take the number density of clouds to trace the number density of protons in the disc , hence n_c ( ) = ( ) .",
    "the constant of proportionality , @xmath85 , will determine the degree of shadowing by optically thick clouds .",
    "the probability of obscuration , @xmath90 , with maximal value 1 , is proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "we take the emitted flux to be proportional to the flux illuminating the clouds , @xmath91 , the number density of the clouds , and the cross section of the clouds .",
    "we take two contributions to the flux illuminating the clouds , a central illumination ( e.g. due primarily to synchrotron radiation in the innermost regions of the flow for adafs mahadevan 1997 ) an x - ray bath throughout the disc ( due to bremsstrahlung radiation ) .",
    "the central illumination falls of as @xmath92 and the bremsstrahlung is proportional to the square of the number density of particles in the disc .",
    "so the emitted flux is given by @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constants determining the relative importance of central radiation and the x - ray bath .",
    "they will depend on the mass accretion rate of the system ( mahadevan 1997 ) and also the geometry of the clouds .",
    "the @xmath96 term contains the information that only the side of the cloud facing the centre of the disc is illuminated by the central flux .",
    "hence , the corresponding reprocessed flux is only visible for clouds on the far side of the hole with respect to the observer , and the amount of flux seen by the observer decreases as the illuminated side of the clouds becomes more edge on to the observer .",
    "@xmath97 is the primary visibility function , analogous to the visibility function described earlier , giving the probability of photons emitted from the central regions reaching the cloud without being obscured by intermediate clouds .",
    "fortunately , the photon paths from the central illumination are radial and so the integration of equation [ eq : int ] becomes analytically tractable , using appropriate expressions for the cross sections and cloud number densities .    to give some visualisation of the processes involved",
    ", we will consider five cross sections of the disc at different heights above the equatorial plane , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "for each cross section , we compute a frequency map and a visibility map for both a centrally illuminated ( synchrotron dominated ) case and an x - ray bath ( bremsstrahlung dominated ) case .",
    "the disc visualised is a self - similar adaf disc with @xmath98 and @xmath11 , viewed at 60 degrees .",
    "the results are shown in fig.2 , in which the observer is situated to the right .    * figure 1 : * the cross sections of the disc used in fig .",
    "some thought reveals that the plots of fig .",
    "2 make sense physically , and the qualitative features deserve some further comments .",
    "the redshift map of the equatorial is different in two respects from the standard redshift maps of thin discs .",
    "firstly , the regions of largest doppler shift are rotated slightly with respect to the observer .",
    "this is because the radial motion is of similar magnitude to the rotational motion .",
    "secondly , gravitational redshift is much more dominant .",
    "this is because the velocities are significantly less than the keplerian velocities of a thin disc ( see comments in  2.1 ) .",
    "as we would expect , the redshifts become less pronounced as we move away from the equatorial plane .",
    "the visibility in the centrally illuminated case is a superposition of the visibility in the x - ray bath case with the primary visibility .",
    "the primary visibility implies that the observer can only see clouds on the far side of the hole ( hence there is more obscuration on the top part of the disc than the bottom part ) and that the more edge - on clouds appear less illuminated .",
    "the visibility in the x - ray bath case is determined by the size and number density of clouds as well as the the length of the of the trajectory through the clouds .",
    "this results in the central regions being the most obscured because the disc under consideration has @xmath99 , which means the cloud number density times cross section is largest in the central regions . also , the bottom regions are more obscured than the top regions because they are further from the observer",

    "the third has @xmath112 , hence the density is concentrated within around 30 degrees of @xmath16 on each side of the equatorial plane .",
    "we take this disc to be dominated by central illumination .    a striking feature of the profiles from the two @xmath98 adaf discs considered , figs . 3 and 4 , is the lack of significant dependence on the inclination angle ( compare to the profiles from flat thin discs in , e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1989 , which show a strong inclination dependence ) .",
    "this is because the velocities given by equations [ eq : two]-[eq : three ] have magnitudes smaller than the keplerian velocities of thin discs and so extreme blue doppler shifts do not appear .",
    "there is more blue - shifted flux for the higher inclination discs , which is why the peak very near the rest frequency is lower in the higher inclination discs .",

    "we have considered a model in which cold , dense clouds are embedded in an otherwise optically thin , but geometrically thick accretion flow . assuming these clouds reprocess primary x - ray emission from a central source and an x - ray bath , we have computed the expected fluorescent iron line profiles .",
    "this is a different scenario to the standard calculation of line profiles from thin , flat discs .",
    "we considered various solutions for the dynamics of the disc : adafs , pure radial infall models , and bipolar outflows .",
    "we allow these solutions to specify the velocity , number density and size of the clouds at different points of the engine . in calculating the line profiles ,",
    "a new effect compared to the thin disc models is the obscuration of flux by the clouds themselves , which are optically thick .",
    "many of the resulting line profiles are similar to those from thin disc models , suggesting that thin discs do not provide a unique model that is able to reproduce observations of iron line profiles .",
    "this suggests that cloud models warrant further study .",
    "previous work has focused primarily on the x - ray continuum ( sivron and tsuruta 1993 ; bond and matsuoka 1993 ; nandra and george 1994 ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 ) but there has been little modelling of the relativistic iron fluorescent line for the cloud model .",
    "karas et al .",
    "2000 considered non - relativistic profiles with large clouds at one radius .    a further incentive to consider thick disks with embedded clouds",
    "is that they may help resolve problems arising in thin disc modelling which relate to the inclination of discs and the reprocessed fraction .",
    "this includes the puzzling preference for low inclinations for seyfert 2s ( turner et al . 1998 ) , some incongruences between inferred inclinations from iron line modelling and those determined from other methods ( nishiura et al .",
    "1998 ; sulentic et al . 1998a",
    "; wang et al . 1999 ) , and the observed reprocessed fraction appearing to be too low and/or uncorrelated with line width ( e.g. lee et al . 2000 ; chiang et al .",
    "2000 ; weaver 2000 ; sulentic et al .",
    "1998b ) . in this regard , we find that many of our embedded cloud , thick disc profiles ( modelled with adaf type flows ) are relatively insensitive to the inclination angle because a significant pressure support means that the bulk velocities are smaller than the keplerian values .",
    "this latter feature also means that many of our profiles have sharp blue cut - offs because they are dominated by the gravitational redshift . whether the sharp blue cutoff remains true in the kerr case , where the disc extends closer to central hole and",
    "hence can acquire greater velocities should be investigated .",
    "note that this will also depend fundamentally on the innermost radius at which the reprocessing clouds can survive .",
    "a thick geometry can also allow a wider range of reprocessed fractions , depending on the cloud distribution and amount of obscuration .",
    "to summarise , the embedded cloud+ thick disc model allows a wider range of disc flow solutions to show reprocessed x - rays lines , and highlights how an alternative geometry can produce profiles similar to those from thin discs .",
    "the model can also lead to profiles with different properties to those of the thin discs , such as less sensitivity to inclination angle .",
    "as such , we suggest the cloud model deserves further investigation .",
    "this would include more consideration of the mechanisms of cloud formation and sizes , generalisation to the kerr metric , and application to specific sources .",
