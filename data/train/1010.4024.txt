    "v374 peg is an m4 dwarf @xcite whose x - ray emission has been detected by the rosat satellite @xcite . @xcite and @xcite presented photometry in @xmath3 and @xmath4 filters , both paper report intense and frequent flares on the star .",
    "recently , @xcite published spectroscopic observations of v374 peg ( along with some of the photometry presented in this paper ) , which showed intensive emission in the h@xmath5 line .",
    "a reason why this object is especially interesting is the mass of the star : it is @xmath6 @xcite , which places it just below the theoretical limit of full convection ( @xmath7 according to @xcite ) . above this limit stars",
    "have a radiative core with a convective envelope and are supposed to sustain a solar - type @xmath8 dynamo @xcite . below @xmath7 stars",
    "are fully convective , but the origin of their magnetic fields is unclear in details . @xcite and @xcite showed , that these kind of stars can produce large - scale , non - axisymmetric fields using @xmath9-dynamo , if they rotate rigidly . on the other hand , they can have axisymmetric , poloidal fields , given that they have strong differential rotation @xcite . as spectropolarimetric observations of @xcite and @xcite have showed v374 peg has a very weak differential rotation , but at the same time the star has stable , axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic field , which does nt fit to the current theoretical models .    in this paper",

    "the telescope is equipped with a @xmath10 princeton instruments ccd .",
    "the @xmath0 light curves have been obtained between 2008 july 31 and 2009 october 12 in seven observing runs .",
    "the observing runs are separated by about 3 weeks .",
    "data reduction and aperture photometry was done using standard iraf routines . the resulting light curve in @xmath11 passband is plotted in fig . [ fig : all_v ] .",
    "for the phased light curves we used the following ephemeris : @xmath12 where the period was determined for the whole photometric observation using the sllk method described by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm phases the datasets with different periods and chooses the period giving the smoothest light curve as the correct one , giving a more reliable result than fourier - analysis for quasi - periodic , non - sinusoidal light curves .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=27.0% ]    when looking at the light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all_v ] ) the first impression is that  except the flares  there is no change in the mean brightness level , i.e. the total spottedness remains the same .",
    "a closer look reveals that during our observations two stable active regions could be found on the stellar surface : one at @xmath15 and another one at @xmath16 phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] ) . for easier visualization",
    "we have made a spotmodel ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nightly ] ) using the sml software @xcite supposing a surface temperature of 3000k , a spot temperature of 2800k @xcite , and circular spot shape .",
    "the overall shape of the phased light curve remains the same during our @xmath17 day - long time - series , which means , that these active regions do not change their size and position in appreciable extent .",
    "thus , from our photometry we can confirm the finding of @xcite and @xcite : the light curve of v374 peg is stable on the timescale of a year .",
    "however , the light curve is not constant at all : small changes can be seen on a nightly timescale ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nightly ] ) .",
    "these variations are mainly seen around the active region at 0.6 phase .",
    "it is possible , that these variations are caused by newly - born and decaying spots in the same active region , similarly to the emerging flux ropes in active nests on the surface of the sun .",
    "we can conclude , that the location and size of the two active regions are stable , but the exact spot configuration is changing very rapidly .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] , it can be clearly seen that v374 peg has active and less active states . during the first",
    "two observing runs frequent flaring could be observed , while in the next two runs the light curve is free of flares , with the spot configuration and the rapid nightly variations remaining the same as before ( note , that there is a gap of @xmath18 days between the first two and the subsequent observing runs ) . during the following two runs the star is more active again , and in the last run the phase coverage of the light curve is very poor , so no exact conclusions can be drawn from that one .",
    "it seems that the flaring and non - flaring phases on v374 peg vary on monthly timescale .",
    "the fact , that the nightly variation of the light curve occurs around the same phase ( @xmath16 ) as the bulk of the flares , suggests that there is a connection between them .",
    "the frequent flares can be a result of reconnection between the emerging flux ropes of the active nest around phase 0.6 .",
    "our observations have raised some interesting questions .",
    "is there any periodicity in the changing of the flaring / non - flaring state of v374 peg ?",
    "if yes , what is the underlying cause of this behaviour ?",
    "until now , all the studies have noted , that the magnetic configuration of the object seems to be stable . on",
    "what timescale are the large - scale changes happening ? hopefully these questions can be answered by further photometric monitoring and by more detailed modelling of the object .",
