    "in the absence of charged current neutrino data , the experiments on polarized inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) yield information only on the sum of quark and antiquark parton densities ( pdfs ) , @xmath2 , and the polarized gluon density @xmath3 . in order to extract separately @xmath4 and @xmath5 other reactions are needed .",
    "one possibility is to use the _ polarized _ semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon processes ( sidis ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a detected hadron ( pion , kaon , etc ) in the final state . in these processes",
    "new physical quantities appear - the collinear fragmentation functions @xmath8 which describe the fragmentation of quarks and antiquarks into hadrons . due to the different fragmentation of quarks and antiquarks , the polarized parton densities @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 can be determined separately from a combined qcd analysis of the data on inclusive and semi - inclusive asymmetries .",
    "the key role of the fragmentation functions for the correct determination of sea quark parton densities @xmath5 , especially of the polarized strange quark densitiy , was discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that the w data from rhic give no information about the polarized strange quark density and can not help to solve the so called `` strange quark polarization puzzle '' ( see the second reference in [ 1 ] ) .",
    "there are different sources to extract the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) themselves : semi - inclusive @xmath9 annihilation data , single - inclusive production of a hadron @xmath7 at a high transverse momentum @xmath10 in hadron - hadron collisions , unpolarized semi - inclusive dis processes .",
    "it is important to mention that the data on hadron multiplicities in unpolarized sidis processes are crucial for a reliable determination of ffs , because only then can one separate @xmath11 from @xmath12 ( from the other processes only the sum of them can be determined ) .",
    "the first global analysis based on all these reactions was carried out by de florian , sassot , stratmann ( dss ) group @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the properties of the extracted set of ffs significantly differed , especially in the kaon sector , from those of the other then published sets of ffs @xcite determined from analyses in which the sidis data have been not included .",
    "unfortunately , the dss ffs were based on the _ unpublished _",
    "hermes05 sidis data on hadron multiplicities @xcite , which were not confirmed in the final hermes data @xcite .",
    "indeed the final hermes data differ significantly from those used in the analysis of @xcite so that the ffs extracted in @xcite are incorrect ( see figures 9 and 10 in @xcite for lo dss ffs , and fig .",
    "5 in @xcite for nlo dss ffs ) .",
    "moreover , in the extraction of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) dss set of ffs there was a mistake ( see the correction in the appendix in @xcite ) in the expression for the longitudinal gluon wilson coefficient function in the theoretical formulae for the multiplicities ( we , independently , became aware of this error recently ) . it has turned out that not only the dss ffs , but all the other sets of pion and kaon ffs presented in @xcite are not in agreement with the final hermes @xcite and the preliminary compass data @xcite on hadron multiplicities . in our paper @xcite a theoretical analysis of these data was performed and new sets of pion fragmentation functions were extracted from the best nlo qcd fits to the data , and it was shown that they disagree significantly with the pion ffs determined from all previous analyses . very recently de florian at al .",
