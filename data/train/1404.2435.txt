    "in the 1970s , montgomery and dyson conjectured that local statistics of critical zeros of the riemann zeta function  in the limit of large height ",
    "should match those of angles of eigenvalues of matrices in the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , which wigner , dyson and others ( see @xcite for a historical overview ) had already used with great success in modeling the energy levels of heavy nuclei .",
    "their ideas , exemplified by the pair correlation conjecture in @xcite , began a long history of investigation into connections between number theory , physics and random matrix theory , which continue strong today ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "there have been many investigations , theoretical and numerical , on the zeros of the riemann zeta function in different regimes .",
    "for example , odlyzko@xcite checked various statistics of critical zeros of the riemann zeta function high up on the critical line numerically , including pair correlation , and found extraordinary agreement with gue predictions , and berry @xcite made semi - classical predictions for these zeros in different ranges , again obtaining beautiful fits .",
    "while the leading order asymptotics of the zero statistics and the eigenvalues statistics are identical and asymptotically no factors of arithmetical nature appear , the work of bogomolny and keating @xcite has identified lower order terms in the pair correlation of the zeros of the riemann zeta function . from their heuristics",
    "is clear that arithmetical contributions play a role in lower order terms . the same can be said about the two  point correlation function for dirichlet l - functions @xcite .",
    "katz and sarnak extended this philosophy to families of @xmath1-functions in @xcite .",
    "they proposed that zeros of @xmath1-functions in suitable `` families '' would have similar statistics to each other , and that the statistics of a given family , in the limit of large analytic conductor , would match those of eigenangles of matrices in some classical compact group under haar measure , in the limit of large dimension .",
    "thus families of @xmath1-functions would correspond to one of three basic symmetry types : unitary , symplectic , or orthogonal . for recent discussions about a working definition of families of @xmath1functions , as well as how to determine the underlying symmetry , see @xcite .",
    "originally the katz - sarnak conjectures were investigated in what we will call the _ local regime near the central point @xmath7 _ ; that is , in intervals around @xmath7 shrinking as the conductor grows , so that the number of zeros it contains is roughly constant ( see , among many others , @xcite for some of the earlier results in the field ) . in this regime",
    "the conjectures are very difficult , and most results are limited to test functions whose fourier transforms have severely restricted support . moreover , it is necessary to average over a `` family , '' as one @xmath1-function can not have sufficiently many normalized zeros near the central point .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to other statistics such as the @xmath8-level correlation ; these statistics study zeros high up on the critical line , and one @xmath1-function has sufficiently many zeros far from the central point to permit an averaging .",
    "for example , rudnick and sarnak @xcite computed the @xmath8-level correlation for the zeroes of not just the riemann zeta function but any cuspidal automorphic form for a restricted class of test functions , proving their expression agrees with the @xmath8-level correlation for the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices .",
    "our own work extends @xcite , in which hughes and rudnick compute the @xmath9^th^ centered moment of the @xmath0-level density of the family of primitive dirichlet @xmath1-functions of fixed conductor @xmath2 as @xmath10 , for test functions @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "this family should have unitary symmetry , which the authors verified for suitably restricted test functions .",
    "we consider analogous questions in the function field case",
    ". there has been significant progress in this area of late ( see @xcite among others ) ; we briefly comment on one particular example which illuminates the contributions that function field results can have to random matrix theory and mathematical physics .    in his thesis",
    "rubinstein @xcite showed the @xmath8-level density of quadratic dirichlet @xmath1-functions agrees with the random matrix theory prediction of symplectic symmetry for support in @xmath13 . in the course of his investigations he analyzed the combinatorial expansions for the @xmath8-level densities of the classical compact groups , though he only needed the results for restricted test functions due to the limitations on the number theory calculations .",
    "gao @xcite doubled the support on the number theory side in his thesis , but due to the complexity of the combinatorics was only able to show the two computed quantities agreed for @xmath14 .",
    "( this is not the first time there has been difficulty comparing number theory and random matrix theory ; see also hughes and miller @xcite , where they derive an alternative to the determinant expansions from katz - sarnak @xcite which is more amenable for comparing @xmath8-level densities with support restricted as in the results in the literature . )",
    "levinson and miller @xcite devised a new approach which allowed them to show agreement for @xmath15 ; unlike the ad - hoc method of gao , they developed a canonical formulation of the quantities and reduced the general case to a combinatorial identity involving fourier transforms .",
    "the work of entin , roditty - gershon and rudnick @xcite _ bypasses _ these extremely difficulty calculations and obstructions ; they are able to show agreement between number theory and random matrix theory by showing the number theory answer agrees with the answer of a related problem involving function fields , which are known to agree with random matrix theory by different techniques . in particular , their function field results prove the combinatorial identity and provide a new path through comparisons with random matrix theory .",
    "katz and sarnak suggested that a possible motivation for their conjectures is the analogy between number fields and global function fields .",
    "the riemann zeta function and dirichlet @xmath1-functions can be considered @xmath1-functions `` over @xmath16 '' ; they possess analogues `` over @xmath6 , '' which occur as factors of numerators of zeta functions of projective curves over @xmath17 .",
    "as proven by deligne @xcite , the zeros of the latter have a spectral interpretation , as reciprocals of eigenvalues of the frobenius endomorphism acting on @xmath18-adic cohomology .",
    "katz - sarnak @xcite proved agreement with gue @xmath8-level correlation _ unconditionally _ for the family of isomorphism classes of curves of genus @xmath19 over @xmath17 , in the limit as both @xmath20 .",
    "their main tool was deligne s result that the frobenius conjugacy classes become equidistributed in the family s monodromy group as @xmath21 .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the `` opposite limit , '' where @xmath22 is held fixed and @xmath23 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered zeros of zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves of genus @xmath19 over @xmath17 .",
    "instead of looking at zeros in the _ local _ regime , they look at zeros in ( 1 ) _ global _ and ( 2 ) _ mesoscopic _ regimes : that is , in intervals @xmath24 around @xmath25 such that either ( 1 ) @xmath26 is fixed , or ( 2 ) @xmath27 but @xmath28 . in both regimes , they show that the zeros become equidistributed in @xmath24 as @xmath23 , and the normalized fluctuations in the number of the zeros are gaussian .",
    "xiong @xcite extended their work to families of @xmath18-fold covers of @xmath29 , for prime @xmath18 such that @xmath30 , again obtaining gaussian behavior .",
    "for other works in this direction see @xcite .    by making use of the ratios conjecture adapted to the function field setting andrade and keating @xcite",
    "have derived the one - level density of the zeros of the family of quadratic dirichlet @xmath1functions over @xmath31 as @xmath22 is fixed and @xmath32 with no restriction on the test function .",
    "also in a recent paper roditty ",
    "gershon @xcite have computed the averages of products of traces of high powers of the frobenius class for the hyperelliptic ensemble and as consequence she was able to compute the @xmath8level density ( with restriction on the test function ) of the zeros of quadratic dirichlet @xmath1functions over @xmath31 .",
    "these results are similar as those obtained in this paper with the difference that in this paper we are using @xmath1functions in a unitary family and the statistics that are being considered are somehow different ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "we study the @xmath6-analogue of the dirichlet @xmath1-function family of @xcite ( we review their definitions and properties in  [ sec : dirichletprelims ] ) .",
    "specifically , we compute @xmath0-and @xmath4-level statistics of its zeros in what we call _ the global regime _ ( we discuss this in greater detail shortly ) , and then show how they imply statistics ( such as the @xmath8-level densities ) in the local regime agree with random matrix theory predictions . at the cost of significantly more laborious calculations , one could calculate higher order statistics using our techniques .",
    "in this introduction we only state the results in the global regime ; we save for later sections the full statements of the local results , as these require further notation ( which many readers are likely to be familiar with ) to state , and content ourselves with remarking that we can prove agreement with random matrix theory predictions . whereas the hughes - rudnick results were restricted by the support of @xmath33 ,",
    "our global test function @xmath34 is periodic and our results are only restricted by a decay condition on the fourier coefficients @xmath35 .    in what follows ,",

    "we refer to this and related quantities as _ global statistics _ , and say we are investigating the zeros in the _",
    "global regime_. this is in contrast to the _ local statistics _ in the _ local regime _ ( which are the zeros near the central point ) . we briefly explain our choice of notation .",
    "we choose to refer to quantities such as as global statistics as all the zeros can contribute on the same order .",
    "notice , though , that this is not the same as other statistics such as the density of states .",
    "the reason is that we are renormalizing the zeros _ not _ by the correct global quantity ( which would be the average spacing between all @xmath50 zeros ) , but rather by the correct scaling factor for zeros near the central point .",
    "thus this statistic is a bit of a hybrid , and allows for the exploration of certain statistics with @xmath22 growing with the degree .",
    "the reason we choose to study these quantities is that we are able to immediately pass from a determination of these global statistics to the more standard local statistics such as the @xmath0-level density ; in particular , we show that the @xmath0-level density of our family agrees with the scaling limit of unitary matrices as @xmath51 and isolate lower order terms .",
