    "while the standard model of elementary particles provides a good description of nature at energies accessible to current experiments , it is widely believed that the variety of interactions operating in very different ways at our energy scales originate from a single fundamental interaction at high energies . the standard lore ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is that ( a )  the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions unify at energy scale @xmath0  gev ; ( b )  the standard model is supersymmetric at energies above @xmath1  tev ; ( c )  there are no new particles participating in gauge interactions with masses between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( `` the grand desert '' ) .",
    "this logical possibility is supported by the unification of coupling constants . running gauge couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) exhibit approximate unification at high energy scale @xmath4 if their evolution is described by perturbative one- or two - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations without extra charged matter heavier than @xmath5 .",
    "the same is true , though parameter - dependent ( @xmath6 ) , for some of the yukawa couplings ( @xmath7 unification ) .",
    "the assumption of the grand desert is important for this conclusion .",
    "supersymmetry is usually introduced because it helps to solve the problem of stability of the higgs mass in the standard model against the radiative corrections .",
    "it is also considered as a necessary ingredient of grand unification for two main reasons .",
    "first , it results in much better unification of couplings .",
    "second , the unification scale is about two orders of magnitude higher than that in theories without supersymmetry .",
    "the latter fact is important for better consistency with the observed absence of the proton decay .",
    "however , almost every particular realization of the conventional grand unification scenario meets considerable problems .",
    "let us outline briefly a few of them .",
    "_ doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "_ in most popular versions of unification , weak @xmath8 and colour @xmath9 gauge groups are subgroups of a simple group , and all matter fields should fall into complete multiplets of this unification group . as an example , weakly interacting leptons belong to one and the same gut multiplet as coloured quarks . in a similar way",
    ", scalar higgs doublets ought to have their coloured counterparts .",
    "these strongly interacting particles ( triplets in the simplest @xmath10 model ) mediate proton decay at unacceptable rate , unless they are superheavy , i.e.have masses of order @xmath4 or higher .",
    "unnatural mass difference between particles of one and the same multiplet , doublet and triplet higgses , can be cured either by fine tuning of parameters or by choosing very complicated higgs sector .    _",
    "potential phenomenological problems . _ with growing experimental accuracy",
    ", it appears that guts predict a bit too fast proton decay @xcite , and also that the coupling constants do not quite merge @xcite ( unification requires @xmath11 slightly larger than measured ) .",
    "_ supersymmetry breaking .",
    "_ if supersymmetry has anything to do with reality , it has to be broken in the low energy theory . a mechanism that breaks supersymmetry in a phenomenologically acceptable way in the ( supersymmetric extensions of the ) standard model",
    "is not known ; therefore , another , completely different sector is usually introduced .",
    "supersymmetry breaking in this new , `` hidden '' or `` secluded '' sector is often associated with strong interactions due to new gauge fields .",
    "these new gauge interactions are not unified with our interactions in conventional guts .",
    "so , one started from the idea of unification but arrived at a separate gauge interaction in the supersymmetry breaking sector .    _",
    "grand desert .",
    "_ experimental data and their theoretical analysis point towards the necessity of several mass scales in the grand desert .",
    "some of the arguments in favour of the new scales are :    * the most popular solution to the _ strong @xmath12 problem _ requires the axion scale of order @xmath13  gev ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "_ non - vanishing neutrino masses _ , in case they are provided by the see - saw or similar mechanism , point towards the mass scale of order @xmath14  @xmath15  gev ( mass of right - handed neutrino ) ( see ,",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "_ models of gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking _ make use of the mass scale of messenger fields of order @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath15  gev ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all these arguments suggest that the grand desert is actually populated with new particles of various masses .",
    "is it possible to relax the assumption about the grand desert and , at the same time , preserve the self - consistent picture of unification ? when a few matter fields are added with masses between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , the gauge coupling unification is preserved at the one - loop level , provided the new states fall into complete representations of a gut gauge group .",
    "however , the two - loop analysis ( which is adequate in view of the current experimental accuracy ) shows that the unification of couplings becomes considerably worse , as compared to the theory with grand desert @xcite .    on the other hand , with",
    "new matter states added , the beta functions change in such a way that the gauge couplings become larger in the ultraviolet . already with a few additional fields , the asymptotic freedom of qcd",
    "is lost , and perturbative rg analysis at high energies may not be applicable .",
    "indeed , the one - loop rg equations for mssm gauge couplings are @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , denote the gauge couplings of @xmath20 , @xmath8 and @xmath21 gauge groups , respectively , the first coefficients of the beta functions are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the momentum scale .",
    "the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ rg ] ) is @xmath27 for @xmath28 , the corresponding couplings grow at high energies .",
    "when new matter fields are added , @xmath29 decrease .",
    "suppose that additional particles fall into complete vector - like multiplets of , say , @xmath10 unified gauge group , for example , @xmath30 of ( @xmath31 ) or @xmath32 of ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath29 are shifted uniformly , @xmath34 where @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "all three gauge groups are not asymptotically free , and their coupling constants grow in the ultraviolet . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the coupling constants reach their landau poles below the planck scale . with measured low energy values of @xmath18 and",
    "appropriately chosen masses of additional matter states , however , the three landau poles coincide ( at the one loop , this common landau pole is always located at @xmath38  gev ) . this phenomenon is called strong unification ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "( 0,160 )    = 1.0    of course , growing gauge couplings at high energies do not contradict low energy data ( in particular , observed asymptotic freedom of qcd ) because new matter fields affect rg evolution only at energies of order of their masses and higher .",
    "the possibility that unification may occur in the non - perturbative domain was considered long ago @xcite and clearly relaxes the unification constraints because non - perturbative evolution of couplings is unknown . despite the latter fact , these models are highly predictive because the low energy evolution of gauge couplings is governed by strongly attractive infrared ( ir ) fixed points @xcite .",
    "the rg equations ( [ rg ] ) , written in terms of the _ ratios _ of coupling constants , @xmath39 have infrared fixed points , @xmath40 which are stable for @xmath41 . in practice , they are so strongly attractive that even at @xmath42 , the ratios are almost constant at @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the low energy behaviour of the couplings is independent of the details of their non - perturbative evolution near @xmath4 , thus keeping the theory predictive .    on the contrary , dynamics at very high energies , of order @xmath4 and higher ,",
    "can not be controlled in the usual way since the theory is strongly coupled at these scales .",
    "various models of high - energy theory can be suggested .",
    "nature may be described at very high energies by a string theory where non - perturbative couplings appear quite naturally .",
    "alternatively , the fundamental theory above @xmath4 may be some unified gauge theory which is asymptotically free and has confinement scale of order @xmath4 ( another possibility is that this theory is approximately scale - invariant `` in the infrared '' ) .    one way to guess the dynamics operating at energies higher than @xmath4 in strong unification scenario is to consider the standard model as a low energy description of a more fundamental strongly coupled theory , in the same way as the sigma model provides the low energy description of qcd .",
    "if mssm is a low energy effective theory , the low energy degrees of freedom , i.e. , quarks , leptons , and gauge and higgs bosons , are composite particles .",
    "the compositeness of all these particles used to be problematic because in most models , composite fermions had masses of the order of the compositeness scale ( baryons are as heavy as @xmath44 ) , and no mechanism leading to composite massless gauge bosons was known ( in the qcd case , there are no light vector bosons ; @xmath45 ) .",
    "these two properties were major obstacles to construct composite version of the standard model with its gauge bosons and chiral fermions which are almost massless compared to possible compositeness scale ( which is not smaller than a few tev according to current experimental bounds @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , both problems are in principle solved by supersymmetry . in the last few years",
    ", outstanding progress has been made in understanding the dynamics of strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "in particular , supersymmetry is so restrictive that sometimes a weakly coupled theory may be uniquely inferred which describes the infrared dynamics of a model with strong coupling at long distances ( like in the qcd case ) .",
    "however , unlike qcd , the low energy effective theory of composite particles _ is _ in a number of cases a theory with massless fermions and massless composite gauge bosons .",
    "this phenomenon is known as @xmath46 duality , and the high- and low - energy theories are often called dual theories .",
    "the famous ( and first ) example @xcite is supersymmetric qcd ( supersymmetric @xmath47 gauge theory with @xmath48 flavours of `` quark '' supermultiplets in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of the gauge group ) . at @xmath49 , the gauge group",
    "is strongly coupled in the infrared while the effective low energy theory of composite particles is @xmath50 ) gauge theory with massless matter supermultiplets that carry non - trivial quantum numbers under the low energy gauge group .",
    "many more examples are known ( some of them are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; their common feature is that the fundamental theory is rather simple but its low energy counterpart may be quite complex and may contain product groups with matter multiplets in chiral representations , very similar to the ( supersymmetric version of the ) standard model .",
    "construction of a realistic composite standard model is a non - trivial task ; the solution to this problem is not unique and requires guesswork .",
    "one possibility is based on the conventional picture of grand unification in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the grand unified theory itself is then an effective theory of composite particles .",
    "an example of a model of this kind was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "that model is based on the fundamental gauge group @xmath51 with @xmath52 ( ! ) ; its low energy description is provided by @xmath53 gut , broken down to the standard model by means of the usual higgs mechanism at weak coupling .",
    "another possibility , which does not require enormous gauge groups of the fundamental theory , is to invoke the idea of strong unification .",
    "we present below a class of models with simple fundamental gauge group and mssm with extra vector - like matter as its low energy description .",
    "these models are strongly coupled at gut scale but , in some sense , represent analytic continuations of usual weakly coupled guts .",
    "consider an asymptotically free gauge theory with gauge group @xmath54 and a certain moduli space . at some submanifold of the moduli space ,",
    "the group @xmath54 is broken down to its subgroup @xmath55 .",
    "choose matter content in such a way that @xmath56 is ir free .",
    "then the low energy theory at these points of moduli space is described by @xmath56 .",
    "it is often possible to add a tree level superpotential that singles out this specific vacuum .",
    "let the superpotential have a minimum where the expectation values of matter fields are of order @xmath57 and @xmath54 is broken down to @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the scale at which @xmath54 is strongly coupled .",
    "at @xmath59 , the theory is weakly coupled , and the usual higgs mechanism is in operation .",
    "thus , at energies below @xmath57 , in particular , in the ir limit , the model is described by @xmath56 gauge theory for any @xmath59 .",
    "let us change smoothly the parameters of the superpotential in such a way that @xmath57 becomes smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "some green s functions , in particular , those indicating which gauge group remains unbroken , exhibit holomorphic dependence of the parameters .",
    "hence , even at @xmath60 , the low energy effective theory is again the same @xmath56 gauge theory , free in the ir .",
    "this argument enables one to establish the low energy effective description even though at intermediate energies of order @xmath58 the model is strongly coupled , and detailed description of dynamics , in particular , of symmetry breaking , is impossible .",
    "we will choose @xmath54 , matter content , and superpotential in such a way that the low energy theory ( @xmath56 ) is just the mssm with extra vector - like matter .",
    "clearly , the model will be an analytical continuation of a usual weakly coupled gut from @xmath59 down to @xmath60 .",
    "very similar arguments appear in the discussion of duality in @xmath61 gauge theories with adjoint chiral superfield @xmath62 and a superpotential , ref .",
    "@xcite . without superpotential ,",
    "the moduli space is described by gauge invariants made of powers of @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 ,  , @xmath64 .",
    "at a generic point of the moduli space , @xmath61 is broken down to @xmath65 .",
    "there are , however , some special points of extended symmetry where @xmath66 .",
    "these points remain supersymmetric vacua if the superpotential , @xmath67 is added .",
    "consider the case in which , in addition to @xmath62 , there are @xmath68 fundamental flavours , @xmath26 , @xmath69 .",
    "then the first coefficient of the beta function of @xmath54 is @xmath70 , whereas for subgroups of @xmath56 one has @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the number @xmath68 can be adjusted in such a way that @xmath54 is asymptotically free while @xmath56 is free in the infrared , so the low energy theory is described by @xmath56 . at intermediate energies ,",
    "the theory is in the conformal phase , and two alternative descriptions are possible  one in terms of ( strongly coupled ) @xmath56 , another in terms of its dual , @xmath73 ; both theories are in a strongly coupled phase , and detailed description of the dynamics is not possible .",
    "consider now the implementation of these arguments to the case where @xmath74 .",
    "the first coefficient of beta function of @xmath54 is equal to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the contribution of the gauge superfield , @xmath77 is the contribution of heavy matter superfields , and @xmath78 corresponds to light superfields . here",
    ", 7 comes from the mssm matter ( 3 chiral generations and electroweak higgses ) and @xmath79 is the contribution of extra vector - like matter fields .",
    "since @xmath54 should be asymptotically free , one needs @xmath80 .",
    "the most restrictive subgroup of @xmath56 is @xmath9 for which @xmath81 ( 6 instead of 7 the since higgs triplets are supposed to be heavy ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that for unification at strong coupling below planck mass it is required that @xmath82 .",
    "so , one has rather strong restriction on the number of extra matter states , @xmath83 for the simplest @xmath10 gut , @xmath84 , so the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) can not be satisfied",
    ". we will discuss @xmath53 case in what follows .",
    "the contributions of the lowest @xmath53 multiplets to @xmath85 are :    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath53 can be broken down to @xmath56 in two different ways . the most popular way ivolves pati  salam group at the intermediate stage , and requires heavy * 54 * or higher representations . with @xmath86",
    ", however , the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "another way is to embed @xmath87 .",
    "this breaking may be achieved by means of ( a ) heavy adjoint field ( see appendix ) or ( b ) heavy adjoint and @xmath88 . in the case ( a ) , one needs non - renormalizable superpotential and @xmath56 is not just the mssm gauge group but contains extra @xmath89 factor ; one has @xmath90 in that case . in the case",
    "( b ) , the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) may be satisfied only if @xmath91 can be arranged to be light and contribute to @xmath79 rather than @xmath77 .",
    "the theory has two essential mass scales : @xmath58 , where @xmath53 becomes strongly coupled , and @xmath92 , where @xmath62 condenses , eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) , is to be understood in terms of the expectation values of @xmath63,  .",
    "we keep weak - coupling notation for simplicity . ]",
    "( see appendix ) . in the ultraviolet , at energies @xmath93 ,",
    "the theory is weakly coupled and correctly described by @xmath53 . in the infrared , at energies @xmath94 , correct",
    "weakly coupled description is provided by @xmath56 ( at very low energies , effects of supersymmetry , electroweak symmetry and @xmath89 symmetry breaking should be taken into account as well as decoupling of extra matter ) . if @xmath59 , this is a usual weakly coupled gut ; however , at @xmath60 the theory is strongly coupled at intermediate energies .",
    "in fact , it is expected that the theory is in the conformal phase there , and one of its descriptions is provided ( in the case when heavy vector - like matter is in * 10*s ) by the dual theory of ref .",
    "the sketch of running of coupling constants is presented in fig .  2 .    ( 0,160 )",
    "= 1.0    further possibilities emerge in the case of @xmath95 gauge group where additional vector - like matter states are necessary counterparts of mssm matter since the lowest @xmath95 representation , the fundamental , is decomposed under @xmath96 as @xmath97",
    ".    since the models of the class outlined here are merely analytically continued weakly coupled guts , many of usual problems remain unsolved . in particular ,",
    "the proton lifetime bound imposes usual restrictions on the scale @xmath57 which is a characteristic mass scale of vector leptoquarks .",
    "one might hope that in the conformal phase , usual calculation of proton decay width is invalid since no asymptotic states like leptoquarks are present and the only important scale is @xmath58 ( in that case , an interesting possibility of low energy unification would be allowed ) .",
    "however , this is not the case since green s functions involving baryon number violating operators may still be estimated , and corresponding amplitudes will be suppressed in the usual way by the mass of virtual leptoquarks .",
    "it is assumed , like in usual weakly coupled guts , that supersymmetry breaking is provided by different mechanisms .",
    "@xmath89 is broken if @xmath88 are involved besides the adjoint ; if only adjoint breaks @xmath53 ( with non - renormalizable superpotential ) then @xmath89 should also be broken by a different mechanism .",
    "strong unification and compositeness may be useful for resolving some of the long - standing difficulties of unification .",
    "a low - energy theory of composites does not necessarily contain higgs triplets since there is no reason to have complete gut multiplets in the effective theory .",
    "proton could be protected from decay by non - anomalous global symmetries of the theory ( which can not be just baryon number because the latter had to be broken in the early universe ) .",
    "the scale of gut symmetry breaking may be relatively low in this case . at the same scale ( which corresponds to the strongly coupled phase )",
    ", supersymmetry can be broken dynamically in a phenomenologically acceptable way , thus avoiding the hidden sector .",
    "these problems could be solved if the mssm with extra vector - like matter is a dual theory of a strongly coupled gut , so that @xmath56 is not a subgroup of @xmath54 and no fundamental superpotential is involved , like in the case of sqcd @xcite . clearly , much work has to be done before a realistic model is constructed .",
    "phenomenological and cosmological implications of strong unification scenarios of this kind deserve further investigation .",
