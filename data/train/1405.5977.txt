    "an apparent condition is that an attractive , or self - focusing , nonlinearity is necessary for the creation of localized states ; however , the attractive cubic nonlinearity simultaneously gives rise to collapse @xcite of localized modes in higher - dimensional settings and , additionally , to strong azimuthal modulational instability of states with intrinsic vorticity @xcite , thus making the search for stable 3d fundamental and topological solitons in materials with the cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity a challenging issue .",
    "various methods have been elaborated over the years , chiefly in the theoretical form , to remedy this situation and stabilize 3d solitary waves , fundamental and vortical ones alike . as outlined in detail in the reviews @xcite",

    ". in particular , a 2d potential may be sufficient for the stabilization of 3d solitons , as well as for the stabilization against supercritical collapse @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to stabilize 3d fundamental solitons by means of  nonlinearity management \" ( time - periodic sign - changing modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient ) , which should be combined , at least , with a 1d lattice potential @xcite .",
    "the use of nonlocal nonlinearities may also help to stabilize 3d localized modes @xcite .",
    "lastly , it is relevant to mention a very recent result concerning 2d localized modes created by the self - focusing cubic nonlinearity in the free space : while a common belief was that they might never be stable , it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that mixed vortex - fundamental modes in a system of two coupled gp equations modeling the spin - orbit - coupled bec can be _ stable _ in the 2d free space .",
    "this unexpected result is explained by the fact that the norm of the mixed modes takes values below the well - known 2d - collapse threshold @xcite .    unlike the above - mentioned methods , the use of spatially inhomogeneous cubic nonlinearity does not yield stabilization of 3d solitons @xcite . in the 2d",
    "setting , a nonlinearity subject to a smooth spatial modulation can not stabilize solitons either @xcite .",
    "stabilization of 2d fundamental solitons ( but not vortex states ) is possible by means of various spatial modulation profiles with sharp edges @xcite .",
    "for this reason , most of previous studies of solitons in inhomogeneous nonlinearity landscapes have been performed in 1d settings , chiefly for periodic modulation patterns @xcite .",
    "a radically different approach was recently put forward and elaborated in refs . @xcite and @xcite : a _ repulsive _ , or defocusing , nonlinearity , whose local strength grows from the center to the periphery , as a function of radius @xmath0 at any rate faster than @xmath1 ,",
    "can readily induce self - trapping of robust localized modes , which are stable not only to weak , but also to strong perturbations ( although these solutions are far from those in integrable models , we call them  solitons \" , as commonly adopted in the current literature when dealing with stable self - trapped modes ) . in becs",
    ", the necessary spatial modulation of the nonlinearity may be induced by means of the tunable feshbach resonance , controlled by magnetic @xcite and/or optical optical - feshbach fields , created with appropriate inhomogeneous profiles @xcite .",
    "the required magnetic field patterns can be provided by magnetic lattices of various types @xcite , while the optical - intensity profiles can be _ painted _ by laser beams in 3d geometries @xcite .",
    "in addition to fundamental solitons , landscapes with a growing repulsive nonlinearity were shown to support topological states in the form of vortex - soliton tori , which can exhibit gyroscopic precession under the action of an external torque @xcite ( precession of a tilted vortex was earlier considered in a different setting in ref .",
    "precession ) .",
    "so far , only the simplest 3d vortex solitons were addressed in the framework of the setting based on the spatially modulated strength of the self - repulsion .",

    ", it should be stressed that the creation of stable structures carrying several topological dislocations is a complex challenge .",
    "previously , such entities were found mostly in the form of vortex - antivortex pairs and vortex arrays in settings with a reduced dimensionality , such as superconductors vort - dipole - supercond , multivort - dipole - supercond , pancake - shaped atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and exciton - polariton condensates @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no examples of 3d solitons with coaxial vortex lines threading several objects forming a complex state , or with the topological charge changing along the axis of the soliton , have been reported .    in this work",
    ", our analysis reveals that 3d media with a repulsive nonlinearity growing from two symmetric minima to the periphery make it possible to create complex but , nevertheless , stable static and dynamical self - trapped topological modes , in the form of fundamental and vortical dipoles , stationary vortex - antivortex hybrids , and precessing hybrids built as a vortex sitting on top of a zero - vorticity mode .",
    "these are remarkable , novel species of 3d localized modes , which have not been reported before in any other systems .",
    "the very existence of the stationary vortex - antivortex solitons and precessing vortex - fundamental hybrids is an unexpected finding , because the topology of such states is different in their top and bottom sections .",

    "the basic model is introduced in section ii , where we also give a number of analytical results , which can be obtained in spite of the apparent complexity of the system .",
    "these include the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) for families of vortex modes , an approximate description of the dipole ( antisymmetric ) modes in terms of quasi-1d dark solitons embedded into the ordinary symmetric states , and an approximation which explains the existence of stationary vortex - antivortex hybrids . results of systematic numerical analysis are reported in section iii , including families of stationary antisymmetric and vortex - antivortex hybrid modes , as well as dynamical ( steadily precessing ) vortex - fundamental hybrids .",

    "the work is concluded by section iv . in the appendix , we additionally present stable analytical solutions for 3d vortex solitons in a model with a bead - shaped spatial modulation profile , which is the first example of any system admitting exact solutions of this type , thus providing a direct proof of their existence .",
