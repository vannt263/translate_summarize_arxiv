    "deep imaging surveys for high redshift studies have , in recent years , been carried out over an increasing range of wavelengths from the x - ray to the radio regimes .",
    "an important motivation is the recognition that surveys at any given wavelength range may provide an incomplete and biased census of high redshift galaxy populations .",
    "moreover , a multi - wavelength approach is highly desirable to assess the nature of and establish links between high redshift samples selected at various wavelengths , and to constrain the properties of their stars and gas contents as indicators of their evolutionary state .",
    "deep surveys at near - infrared wavelengths ( nir ; @xmath25 ) have emerged as an important way to investigate the high redshift universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review , and references therein ) .",
    "nir observations allow one to access the rest - frame optical light of galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "nir surveys provide a vital complement , for instance , to optical surveys , which probe the rest - frame uv light at these redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the rest - frame optical is less affected by the contribution from young massive stars and by dust obscuration , and is expected to be dominated by longer - lived lower - mass stars .",
    "selection in the nir , compared to the optical , thus provides a more reliable means of tracing the bulk of the stellar mass at high redshift , of probing earlier star formation epochs , and of identifying galaxies with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) similar to those of galaxies locally .",
    "a significant advantage of nir surveys is that they enable , in the same rest - frame optical , direct and consistent comparisons between @xmath26 samples and the well - studied populations at @xmath27 .    with the sensitive instrumentation and large format nir detectors mounted on ground - based @xmath28 telescopes or space - based facilities available , it is possible to carry out nir surveys of comparable depth and quality as in the optical .",
    "this greatly helps in the identification of counterparts in optical observations and in the construction of accurate seds .",
    "yet , nir surveys with sufficient depth and angular resolution remain challenging .",
    "for instance , a typical normal nearby @xmath29 galaxy would have an apparent @xmath30-band magnitude @xmath31 if placed at @xmath32 @xcite . among current nir surveys ,",
    "those reaching such faint limits are still scarce .",
    "they include the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) nicmos fields of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hubble ultra deep field ( udf ; * ? ? ?",

    "ground - based surveys include the subaru deep field @xcite , and several blank fields imaged at the keck telescopes @xcite .    in this context , we initiated the faint infrared extragalactic survey ( fires ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) carried out at the eso _ very large telescope _",
    "the survey consists of very deep imaging in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands with the isaac instrument @xcite of two fields with existing deep optical hst wfpc2 data : the hdf - s and @xmath3 , a field around a massive cluster at @xmath4 . in total",

    ", this provides a unique data set with seven or eight band photometry covering @xmath37 over a total area of @xmath38 . with the hdf - s data , fires reaches fainter limits in all three nir bands than any other existing ground - based survey and provides the deepest @xmath30-band map to date .",
    "the @xmath3  field is an essential complement as it considerably increases the survey area to an @xmath39 brighter limit .",
    "the data and source catalogues of the hdf - s are described by @xcite .",
    "several key results of both fields have been published , including sed modeling , spectroscopy , and clustering analysis of the new population of `` distant red galaxies '' at @xmath40 @xcite , determination of the stellar rest - frame optical luminosity density , colours , and mass density at @xmath41 @xcite , determination of the rest - frame optical sizes of galaxies out to @xmath42 @xcite , and the discovery of six large disk - like galaxies at @xmath43 @xcite . in this paper , we present the data and source catalogues of the @xmath3  field . as for hdf - s ,",

    "our strategy for the fires survey was to complement our very deep nir imaging of hdf - s with a wider field , allowing for better statistics on source populations down to flux levels twice brighter than the faint limits of hdf - s .",
    "the @xmath3  field was ideally suited for this purpose because of available hst wfpc2 imaging offering a unique combination of field size and depth .",
    "the wfpc2 data consist of a mosaic of six pointings covering @xmath45 observed through the f606w and f814w filters ( effective wavelengths @xmath46 and 8040   , and effective widths @xmath47 and 1540   , respectively ) .",
    "we will denote these bandpasses as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the total integration time was 6500  s per band and pointing . to extend the optical wavelength coverage , we obtained @xmath50 imaging with the vlt fors1 instrument .    the @xmath3  field benefits from an extensive amount of existing data over the electromagnetic spectrum , including a deep mosaic at 850  taken with the submillimeter common - user bolometric array ( scuba ; k. k. knudsen et al .",

    "these spectroscopic determinations enabled us to calibrate our photometric redshifts (   [ sect - redshifts ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath3  cluster itself has but a small influence over the area surveyed .",
    "the majority of galaxies detected in the mosaics lie in front of or behind the cluster .",
    "the cluster mass distribution has been modeled accurately by @xcite from weak lensing analysis , so that the gravitational lensing can be well accounted for .",
    "the average background magnification effects over the field of view covered by the fires observations range from 5% to 25% between @xmath51 and 4 , and are largest in the cluster s central regions .",
    "we emphasize that colours and seds are not affected since gravitational lensing is achromatic .",
    "moreover , the surface brightness is preserved and , to first order , the surface density to a given apparent magnitude is insensitive to lensing ( the exact effect depends on the slope of the luminosity function of the sources under consideration ) .",
    "table  [ tab - obs ] summarizes the properties of the @xmath3  data set and figure  [ fig - fovs ] illustrates the fields of view of the different instruments .",
    "the observations and reduction of the hst wfpc2 mosaics are presented by @xcite . in this and the following section , we focus on the data taken with isaac and fors1 , both mounted at the vlt antu telescope .",
    "all vlt observations were acquired in service mode as part of the eso large program 164.o-0612 ( p.i .",
    "m. franx ) .",
    "the @xmath3  field was observed with isaac @xcite in imaging mode through the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 filters ( @xmath52 , 1.65 , and 2.16  , and @xmath53 , 0.30 , and 0.27  , respectively ) .",
    "the observations were carried out on 36 nights , in 1999 december , 2000 may , and 2001 february through june .",
    "the short - wavelength camera of isaac is equipped with a rockwell hawaii @xmath54 hgcdte detector array and provides a scale of @xmath55 for a total field of view of @xmath33 .",
    "the wfpc2 mosaic was covered with a square of @xmath56 pointings ( referred to as f1 to f4 ; see figure  [ fig - fovs ] ) .",
    "nominal pointings ensured that adjacent fields overlap by @xmath57 .",
    "the data were obtained in `` observing blocks '' ( obs ) consisting of sequences of 30 exposures totaling 1  h integration time in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and 40 exposures totaling 40  m in @xmath2 .",
    "successive exposures within each ob were dithered randomly in a 20  box to allow the construction of sky frames with minimal object contamination . typical exposure times in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 were of 120 , 120 , and 60  s , split into 4 , 6 , and 6 sub - integrations , respectively .",
    "the entire data set includes 3207 frames grouped in 93 obs , with total integration times of @xmath58 per field and per band .",
    "we rejected about 3% of the frames , representing 3% of the total integration time , because they did not meet our atmospheric seeing or transmission requirements , or because they were affected by strong instrumental artefacts . throughout the paper , we consider only the 3104 frames from 92 obs with sufficient quality .",
    "most of the data were obtained under excellent seeing , with median full - width at half maximum @xmath59 in @xmath0 and @xmath60 in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "ninety percent of the data have a seeing better than @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig - seeing ] gives the seeing distribution of the individual frames .",
    "the fwhm was determined by fitting moffat profiles to bright , isolated , and unsaturated stars in each image ( mostly three to five depending on the field , on the signal - to - noise ratio of the stars , and on whether they lie within the field of view of individual dithered frames ) , and averaging the fwhms per image .",
    "the conditions were photometric for about half of the observing nights , or 53% of the obs .",
    "in the course of the 19-month interval during which the nir observations were taken , the antu primary mirror was twice re - aluminized , in 2000 february and 2001 march .",
    "we will refer to the three periods separated by these events as periods p1 , p2 , and p3 .",
    "the effects of re - aluminization are noticeable in our data , with an increase in sensitivity between successive periods as deduced from bright stars counts in the @xmath3  data and reflected in the photometric zero points .",
    "based on the standard stars data used for flux calibration (   [ sub - red_isaac ] ) , the increase in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 amounts to 37% , 47% , and 50% between p1 and p2 , and 29% , 26% , and 19% between p2 and p3 , for a net gain of @xmath62 .",
    "seven obs were taken in p1 , 41 in p2 , and 45 in p3 .",
    "the isaac pixel scale also varied slightly over time , by a maximum of 0.27% .",
    "figure  [ fig - obs_param ] shows the variations with time and airmass of the relative count rates of stars and of the background levels in the individual frames .",
    "the stars are the same as used for the seeing measurements .",
    "their counts were integrated in a 6-diameter circular aperture in the sky - subtracted frames and normalized to the median values in period p3 .",
    "the background was computed as the median count rates over the raw frames .",
    "the figure also plots the seeing fwhm versus airmass .",
    "the stars count rates increase sharply after each realuminization and , over period p2 , are consistent with the long - term progressive loss of sensitivity between two realuminizations . in contrast",
    ", the background levels have overall remained fairly constant , with no systematic trend with period and the variations reflecting mostly the nightly observing conditions .",
    "this constancy in average background levels was also noticed in the hdf - s data set and presumably indicates that light is scattered in as much as out of the beam .",
    "it implies a substantial increase in telescope efficiency and in source signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) achievable in background - limited data after realuminization .",
    "the nir background can vary on timescales of minutes ; it is dominated by telluric oh airglow lines in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , and by thermal emission from the telescope , instrument , and atmosphere in the @xmath2 band .",
    "the nightly variations in our data are generally largest and most rapid in the @xmath1 band and show little correlation with the hour of observation .",
    "the @xmath30-band background has comparable levels but smaller short - term variations and is systematically higher at the beginning and end of the night .",
    "the @xmath0 background is the lowest and most stable , and peaks at the beginning of the night .",
    "variations in stars count rates within each period reflect changes in sky transparency and there is no apparent airmass dependence .",
    "this indicates that the atmospheric extinction is negligible for airmasses of @xmath63 as covered by the observations .",
    "the seeing is expected to correlate with airmass ( roughly as @xmath64^{0.6}$ ] ) but no obvious trend is seen in our data , partly due to the small range of airmass and because the seeing is largely determined by the actual observing conditions .",
    "the data suggest an overall increase in background levels with airmass , most clearly in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which could be explained by the increasing path length of the thermal and oh - line emitting layers .",
    "however , for successive observations such as within obs , variations in airmass are directly coupled with time so that part of possible trends with airmass may be attributed to nightly patterns in the background .      the @xmath3  field was observed with fors1 @xcite in direct imaging mode on six nights between 2000 january and march using the bessel @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 filters ( @xmath65 , 4330 , and 5550   , and @xmath66 , 870 , and 1070   , respectively ) .",
    "fors1 employs a @xmath67 tektronix ccd detector .",
    "the standard resolution collimator was selected for the observations , giving a @xmath68 scale and a @xmath69 field of view covering entirely the isaac and wfpc2 mosaics .",
    "the data were collected in obs of six successive single exposures of 550 , 400 , and 300  s in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the total integration times are 4.6 , 2.0 , and 0.5  h , respectively , distributed over 5 , 3 , and 1 obs .",
    "this excludes the few aborted or complete obs with insufficient quality , lying well outside our observing conditions specifications . within each",
    "ob , the exposures were dithered in a box of @xmath70 .",
    "the average seeing fwhm of the data is @xmath71 in @xmath13 , @xmath72 in @xmath14 , and @xmath73 in @xmath15 .",
    "the seeing was determined as for the isaac data by fitting moffat profiles to five bright , isolated , unsaturated stars in the individual frames .",
    "the @xmath14- and @xmath15-band data were all taken prior to the 2000 february realuminization while the @xmath13-band observations were carried out both before and after .",
    "our @xmath3  data indicate an increase in @xmath13-band sensitivity of @xmath74 based on stars count rates in a 6-diameter aperture and small rotation angle differences in the camera orientation ( @xmath75 between various obs ) .",
    "the data were obtained during photometric nights except for the three @xmath13-band obs taken in 2000 march .",
    "we reduced the isaac data using the dimsum package within iraf , the eclipse software , and additional routines we have developed specifically for our fires observations .",
    "we followed the general procedure for the hdf - s described by @xcite with adjustments necessary because of the different characteristics of the @xmath3  data set .",
    "in particular , the observations were taken over a longer period where the instrument behaviour changed noticeably . also , the shallower data and more crowded field around @xmath3  required optimization of various steps to minimize residual noise and systematic effects .",
    "we generated dark@xmath76bias images for use in making flat fields by averaging together individual dark frames taken with each detector integration time ( dit ) employed for the flat fields .",
    "the typical level of the dark frames for a given dit varied significantly over time with five distinct epochs identified in our data .",
    "we thus created dark@xmath76bias images appropriate for each epoch in addition to those made from all available dark frames .",
    "we constructed flat fields from sequences of successive exposures of the sky taken during twilight , on nights where the @xmath3  field was observed or as close as possible in time , using the eclipse task `` flat . ''",
    "this task also produced the initial bad ( dead ) pixel masks .",
    "we made three flat fields per night and band as follows : ( 1 ) by forcing eclipse / flat to compute the dark@xmath76bias by itself , ( 2 ) by providing the average dark@xmath76bias image from all available data for the corresponding dit , and ( 3 ) by providing the dark@xmath76bias image for the corresponding dit and observing epoch .",
    "the flat fields often exhibited abrupt jumps at mid - array ( row 512 ) with amplitude up to 20% and significant differences in large - scale gradients between the three methods , typically at the 5% level .",
    "these features carry the imprint of the detector bias , which dominates the signal in the dark frames .",
    "the bias level is very uniform along rows but varies importantly along columns , with a steep initial decline flattening progressively from bottom to top of each of the lower and upper halves of the array frame .",
    "the bias depends not only on the dit but also on the detector illumination during and prior to an exposure , so that for a given dit the dark@xmath76bias image may not represent well the dark@xmath76bias present in the twilight frames . for each night and band , we chose the flat field for which the bias signatures were minimized .",
    "this was generally the one obtained with method 1 , which better accounted for the intrinsic dark@xmath76bias of the twilight frames , but in a few cases method 3 was the most successful .",
    "the nightly flat fields also varied noticeably between epochs where the dark@xmath76 bias changed most but were otherwise very similar .",
    "we created `` master flat fields '' by averaging the adopted nightly flat fields for each epoch .",
    "all flat fields were normalized to unit mean over the image .      for each science exposure in a given ob",
    ", we constructed a `` sky '' image to remove the sky and telescope background , and the dark@xmath76bias signal .",
    "we used a minimum of three and a maximum of eight temporally adjacent frames depending on when the science exposure was taken during the ob sequence . in a `` first pass , ''",
    "the individual sky frames were scaled to a common median level equal to that of the science frame , averaged together with minimum - maximum rejection algorithm at each pixel , and subtracted from the science frame .",
    "cosmic rays and hot pixels were identified using the `` l.  a. cosmic '' routine @xcite and negative outliers at @xmath77 below the mean residual background were added to the bad pixel lists .",
    "the sky - subtracted frames within each ob were aligned using integer - pixel shifts and coaveraged . from this intermediate combined ob image ,",
    "an object mask was created by applying an appropriate threshold to identify astronomical sources . in a second `` mask pass , ''",
    "the sky subtraction procedure was repeated using the object masks to minimize the contribution of sources in the background computation .",
    "the mask - pass sky - subtracted frames were divided by the master flat field for the corresponding epoch of observation and band , and combined as before .",
    "associated weight maps were generated , proportional to the total integration time of all frames contributing at each pixel .",
    "we normalized the final ob images to a 1s integration time and the weight maps to a maximum value of  1 .",
    "non - linearity ( raw counts exceeding 10000  adu , for which eso reports 99% linearity ) is not a concern except for the very few brightest sources ( @xmath78 per isaac field ) in the frames obtained under the best seeing and transparency conditions .",
    "we did not apply any correction for non - linearity but excluded those stars with raw counts well above 10000  adu in the flux calibration and psf determination described below .    in coaveraging the reduced frames , bad pixels and cosmic rays",
    "were masked out and no clipping or rejection algorithm was applied .",
    "we verified that no strongly deviant pixel , either persistent or as single event , was missed by comparing the ob images to versions obtained by median - combining the registered sky - subtracted frames without masking and from the behaviour of individual pixels throughout the stack of unaligned unmasked sky - subtracted frames .",
    "in several obs , we noticed satellite tracks , moving targets ( presumably kuiper belt objects ) , and spurious features produced by reflection effects of bright sources falling on the edges of the detector array .",
    "we removed them with customized masking .",
    "we inspected the individual reduced frames to identify those with significant residual artefacts due to poor sky subtraction or instrumental features .",
    "we implemented additional mask - pass routines in dimsum to improve the quality of the affected data , described in what follows .",
    "_ bias residuals ",
    "particular processing was required to account for the time and illumination - dependent bias level of the detector .",
    "the median - scaling applied in constructing the sky images accounts for the global intensity of the dark@xmath76bias but not for its spatial structure .",
    "because the bias variations are strong along columns but negligible along rows , we removed the residuals by subtracting the median row by row in all sky - subtracted frames . in many obs , the bias varied so strongly and rapidly that it led to spurious `` numerical ghosts '' with shapes reminiscent of the masked sources .",
    "these features were most conspicuous in regions of steepest spatial gradients in the bias ( lower parts of the bottom and top half of the frames ) and during periods of steepest gradients in time ( related to the illumination history ) .",
    "the average of the scaled sky frames did not represent accurately the local background in the science frame and the effect was worsened by the object masking which reduced locally the number of frames used to estimate the background .",
    "the computed background in the regions with objects masked in one or more of the sky frames thus differed significantly from that of adjacent regions masked in none of the sky frames , imprinting positive ghosts for a locally underestimated background or vice - versa .",
    "we eliminated the numerical ghosts while constructing the sky frames : in addition to the median - scaling , we accounted for an additive component representing the bias offsets between a science frame and each of its corresponding scaled sky frames by fitting a median to each row in the difference maps .",
    "we applied this procedure to the 28 obs where ghosts were clearly recognized by eye inspection , mostly in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "_ residual large - scale gradients ",
    "_ for about half of the data , significant large - scale gradients remained in the sky - subtracted frames .",
    "they were caused primarily by highly variable sky and thermal background emission , and stray light .",
    "the fractions of obs affected in each band reflect the background behaviour seen in figure  [ fig - obs_param ] : 92% in @xmath1 , 46% in @xmath2 , and 27% in @xmath0 .",
    "we first attempted to remove these residuals by fitting two - piece cubic splines directly to the object - masked frames , along rows or columns depending on the gradient pattern . owing to crowding in the @xmath3  field ,",
    "the fits were however generally poorly constrained .",
    "we thus created template `` flat images '' by registering and coaveraging all sky - subtracted frames unaffected by residual gradients , taken from all obs of the appropriate field and band to increase the s / n ratio .",
    "we subtracted the flat templates from the affected frames .",
    "this largely eliminated sources , leaving residual cores due to small mismatches in alignment and seeing .",
    "we used these difference maps to create new masks and fit the two - piece cubic splines . because the masked area was substantially reduced , the fits were much better constrained , allowing successful removal of the residual gradients .",
    "we performed this second - order sky subtraction for the 29 obs where the gradients were strongest and apparent in the combined ob images .    _ instrumental features and other artifacts  _ a high spatial frequency pattern known as the `` odd - even column effect '' appeared in part of the data taken after the 2001 march realuminization ( 19 obs ) .",
    "it is characterized by an offset in level between adjacent columns , occasionally further modulated over a width of about 20 pixels and generally different between detector quadrants .",
    "when present , we corrected for this artifact by subtracting the median of the background along columns and for each quadrant separately in the object - masked sky - subtracted frames .",
    "finally , high to moderate spatial frequency ripples presumably from moonlight reflections were present in the background of 41 obs , with important frame - to - frame variations in intensity , structure , and orientation .",
    "a semi - circular high - frequency time - dependent interference pattern was also obvious in 3 obs .",
    "the complexity and variability of these artifacts make them very difficult to correct for . since they generally averaged out in the combined ob images , we did not treat them in any particular way except by excluding the most affect frames which left noticeable patterns in the ob images .",
    "we corrected the ob images for the documented isaac geometrical distortion while simultaneously registering and interpolating the isaac data to the wfpc2 maps at @xmath79 .",
    "this `` rectification '' was done using the same algorithm as for the hdf - s data described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the transformation corrects for distortion , aligns the isaac ob images ( allowing for sub - pixel shifts ) , and applies the best - fit linear transformation determined from the positions of stars and point - like sources across the @xmath0-band images and the wfpc2 @xmath49-band mosaic .",
    "the images are resampled using third - order polynomial interpolation , and only once to minimize the effects on the noise properties .",
    "we rescaled the rectified ob images to ensure flux conservation .",
    "since the isaac field distortions have small amplitude and thus negligible effects on the photometry , we used a constant flux scaling factor for the entire images .",
    "the rectification of the ob images instead of the individual frames affects the point - spread function ( psf ) because of the dithering and integer - pixel registration within each ob .",
    "figure  [ fig - seeing_obs ] plots the psf fwhm measured in the rectified ob images versus the median of the fwhms in the single frames of the corresponding ob .",
    "the effect is negligible at @xmath80 and increases towards lower fwhm up to a maximum of 25% at @xmath81 , the limit of undersampling .",
    "we determined the instrumental photometric zero points ( zps ) using observations of standard stars .",
    "all stars were selected from the lco / palomar nicmos list @xcite except for one taken from the ukirt faint standards list ( * ? ? ?",
    "* observed on 1999 december 18 ) .",
    "we measured all fluxes and magnitudes for photometric calibration in a 6-diameter circular aperture , which proved to be adequate by monitoring the growth curve of the standard stars and of reference stars in the @xmath3  field .",
    "the standard stars were observed in sequences of five dithered exposures .",
    "we integrated the count rates of the stars within the 6-diameter aperture in each frame of a sequence after sky subtraction and flat - fielding ( using the appropriate flat field for the epoch of observation and band ) .",
    "we computed single - star fluxes by averaging , with @xmath82-clipping , the count rates for each sequence .",
    "typical uncertainties , taken as the median of the standard deviations of single - star fluxes , were of 1.7% ( average of 2.1% ) . using the calibrated magnitudes , we derived single - star zps .",
    "we identified as non - photometric the nights where single - star zps varied by more than twice the typical uncertainties ( i.e. 3.4% ) , and excluded them from the subsequent analysis . for each of the remaining nights , we derived nightly zps by averaging the single - star zps . because the nightly zps exhibit a large systematic increase after realuminization events , we computed period zps by averaging with @xmath82-clipping the nightly zps for each of p1 to p3 .",
    "nights rejected by the @xmath82-clipping were added to the initial list of non - photometric nights . in total , 17 out of 36 nights were photometric according to our criteria .",
    "the median night - to - night dispersion of the zps is 0.024  mag and varies from 0.007 and 0.060  mag depending on the band and period .",
    "the average zps per period in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 increased by 0.340 , 0.415 , and 0.441  mag from p1 to p2 , and by 0.276 , 0.255 , and 0.188  mag from p2 to p3 .",

    "we thus determined the background rms variations from the fwhm of the best - fit gaussian to the observed distribution for each aperture size . while at any fixed spatial scale",
    ", the noise properties over the images are consistent with a pure gaussian , the variations with @xmath159 deviate appreciably from gaussian scaling , being systematically larger and increasing non - linearly . as for the hdf - s data @xcite , the real noise behaviour in the @xmath3  data set can be well approximated by the polynomial model : @xmath160 where @xmath161 designates the band ( and the field for the isaac data ) and the weight term accounts for the spatial variations in noise level related to the exposure time .",
    "the coefficient @xmath162 represents the effects of correlated noise , which are dominated by the resampling of the images to the wfpc2 pixel scale and , for the psf - matched data , the convolution applied .",
    "the curvature in the @xmath163 relations quantified by the coefficient @xmath164 indicates a noise contribution that becomes increasingly important on larger scales .",

    "the noise behaviour is qualitatively the same in all of the images .",
    "figure  [ fig - noise ] shows the results for the four fields of the psf - matched @xmath2-band mosaic , with the background rms measurements for the various apertures and the best - fit polynomial models ( eq .  [ eq - noise ] ) compared to the expected linear relationship for uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "the flux distributions from which the background rms is derived are also plotted for selected aperture sizes . with the empty areas defined from the @xmath2-band map , sources that are undetected in @xmath2 but detectable in the other bands",
    "will contribute to the aperture flux distributions .",
    "this is reflected in the distributions for bands other than @xmath2 , more obviously for the optical bands , with a small excess of positive flux measurements . however , the bias introduced in the results is very small because the positive tail affects very little the gaussian fits .",
    "table  [ tab - noise ] summarizes the results for the psf - matched images , along with the corresponding @xmath92 background - noise limiting magnitudes .",
    "table  [ tab - depth ] gives the limiting magnitudes for the rectified but unconvolved images .",
    "the limiting magnitudes refer to a `` point - source aperture '' with a diameter @xmath165 that maximizes the s / n of photometric measurements in unweighted circular apertures of point - like sources .",
    "compared to the hdf - s data set , the @xmath3  field limiting magnitudes are @xmath166 brighter , depending on the band .",
    "this comparison is rather crude because it does not account for the partly different bandpasses in the optical ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 in particular ) or for the different angular resolution between the data sets .",
    "for the isaac nir data , the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band psf - matched maps are @xmath167 shallower than the hdf - s images .",

    "the differences expected based only on the integration time are of @xmath170 for similar observing conditions ( seeing , atmospheric transmission , and night - sky oh and continuum emission ) .",
    "the depths achieved for the @xmath3  field exceed slightly these expectations .",
    "various factors can explain this performance .",
    "the most important one is probably that about half of the @xmath3  data were taken after the 2001 march realuminization ( period p3 ) , when the effective sensitivity had increased by @xmath171 compared to earlier epochs since the end of 1999 ( p1 and p2 ) during which the hdf - s observations were carried out (   [ sub - obs_isaac ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "we also analyzed the distributions of flux ratios between bands .",
    "the results obtained for ratios measured in random pairs of apertures ( i.e. , not necessarily spatially coincident ) correspond closely to the predictions based on eq .",
    "[ eq - noise ] assuming the noise is uncorrelated between bands .",
    "in contrast , the scaling relations derived for ratios within registered apertures for several band pairs lie systematically below such predictions on scales of @xmath172 ( although still well above expectations for pure uncorrelated gaussian noise ) .",
    "this suggests that the background noise pattern is correlated between the bands , as was also seen in the hdf - s data set @xcite .",
    "the effects are most important and up to @xmath74 among the maps obtained with the same instrument .",
    "this is likely due to the large - scale residuals remaining after the data processing ( e.g. , from the bias , sky , and flat - field ) , which are similar for a given instrument .",
    "interestingly , this effect is also present at the 10% level for ratios involving the fors1 @xmath14 or @xmath15 bands and the wfpc2 @xmath48 or @xmath49 bands , as well as between the wfpc2 @xmath49 and isaac @xmath0 bands .",
    "this is probably the signature of sources undetected in @xmath2 but clearly present in the other bands contaminating the `` empty '' background flux measurements .",
    "confusion noise was argued in the case of the hdf - s data but is unlikely for the shallower @xmath3  maps .",
    "the implications of this analysis is that our uncertainties on colours are probably slightly overestimated because we propagated those of each bandpass neglecting the cross - correlation terms .",
    "we did not attempt to account for these effects as they are much smaller than the difference between uncorrelated gaussian scaling and our empirical relationships .",
    "our aim was to construct a @xmath2-band selected source catalogue as uniform as possible over the entire @xmath3  field , optimized for point - like sources , and with reliable detections and optical - nir photometry . because of the different noise properties between the four isaac fields , detection with a constant s / n threshold would result in different limiting magnitudes and limiting surface brightnesses from one field to the other .",
    "we therefore applied a constant surface brightness threshold @xmath173 instead .",
    "we compromised between completeness and reliability by choosing a @xmath173 criterion so as to keep the contamination by spurious ( faint ) sources below @xmath174 in all fields .",
    "the general procedure for source detection and photometry is analoguous to that followed by @xcite in making the hdf - s catalogue .",
    "we carried out the source detection using the sextractor software version 2.2.2 @xcite .",
    "the objects were detected in the rectified but non psf - matched @xmath2-band map .",
    "to optimize for point - like sources , we filtered the detection map with a gaussian kernel of @xmath175 approximating well the core of the @xmath2-band psf .",
    "the detection criterion was that at least one pixel be brighter than @xmath176 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath17 of the background noise in the filtered @xmath2-band mosaic over the two fields with intermediate depth ( f3 and f4 ) .",

    "field - to - field variations are likely large for drgs , as suggested by the high clustering amplitude derived for the hdf - s sample @xcite and by the fact that drgs lie at the high - mass end of galaxies at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "these variations may explain why such red @xmath287 selected galaxies have not been recognized as an important high redshift population in previous nir surveys ; those deep enough to detect very red and faint high redshift sources were limited to very small areas .",
    "another class of red objects , the extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath288 selected by their very red @xmath289 or @xmath290 colours , has been well - studied in the past decade ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - colcol ] shows that at @xmath284 in the @xmath3  field , there is some overlap between samples selected with the drg criterion @xmath291 and with the ero criterion @xmath292 .",
    "about 60% of @xmath291 objects also have @xmath292 colours .",
    "however , @xmath131 only of @xmath292 objects meet the drg criterion .",
    "this reflects primarily a redshift effect : the drg criterion is efficient at isolating evolved or very dusty systems at @xmath40 , as it is intended to , while the ero criterion is more sensitive to galaxies at lower redshifts , down to @xmath293 .",
    "figure  [ fig - zhist ] compares the redshift distributions of the samples in the @xmath3  field .",
    "we have presented the observations , reduction , source detection and photometry of the field around the @xmath3  cluster observed as part of fires .",
    "we have described the main properties of the final images and of the @xmath2-selected source catalogue .",
    "the @xmath3  field complements our hdf - s data , covering an area @xmath270 times wider with very similar image quality in the nir and reaching limiting total magnitudes for point sources about 0.7  mag brighter .",
    "we have compared the photometric redshifts with the extensive set of spectroscopic redshifts available for the @xmath3field and found very good agreement with @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath3  field confirms our initial findings from the hdf - s , with large numbers of red nir - selected high redshift objects , and substantially increases the statistical significance of the samples , in particular for the distant red galaxies at @xmath40 selected by their @xmath291 colours .",
    "this paper completes the initial phase of the fires survey .",
    "figure  [ fig - surveys ] places fires in a broader context by comparing it in the area - depth plane to other published deep nir surveys .",
    "the hdf - s data constitute the deepest ground - based imaging at nir wavelengths to date . in @xmath84 and @xmath1 band ,",
    "it is only surpassed in depth by space - based imaging with hst nicmos while in @xmath30-band it represents the currently deepest observations even from space .",
    "the @xmath3  field occupies a unique position in terms of area - depth combination , being the widest for its depth or conversely the deepest for its size .",
    "we have exploited our deep optical - nir imaging of the hdf - s and @xmath3  fields in several papers to investigate the properties of the @xmath2-selected galaxies and various sub - samples , focusing on their seds , their rest - frame optical luminosities , colours , sizes , their stellar masses , their clustering , and the derived redshift evolution of both their integrated light and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the results of this initial phase have guided the directions of our current and planned follow - up programs .",
    "the scientific inferences from the hdf - s and @xmath3  fields remain yet limited by the effects of field - to - field variations , and the size and low spectroscopic completeness of the high - redshift samples in particular .",
    "we have thus actively undertaken the addition of more disjoint fields and extensive spectroscopy .",
    "current and planned follow - ups also include near - infrared integral field spectroscopy , extension of the imaging to other wavebands ( especially in the mid - ir with spitzer ) , and hst acs and nicmos high angular resolution imaging to constrain the nature and detailed spectral , dynamical , and morphological properties of the galaxy samples ( e.g. , @xcite ; k. k. knudsen et al .  , in preparation ) . with its unique data set ,",
    "fires has been influential to our understanding of galaxy evolution , and will continue to be so as it is extended by its various follow - up programs .",
    "it sets an important basis in the framework of major current and planned surveys such as , for instance , goods and cosmos .    we would like to thank the eso staff for obtaining the high quality isaac and fors1 data in service mode and for making them readily available to us .",
    "we also thank henk hoekstra for kindly computing for us the lensing magnifications in the @xmath3  field .",
