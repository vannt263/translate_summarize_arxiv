    "we present a brief analysis of high - temperature ( ht ) and low - field expansions for the free energy of the conventional 3d ising model in an external uniform magnetic field , extended from the presently available@xcite order @xmath2 up to order @xmath3 in the case of the simple - cubic ( @xmath4 ) lattice , and from the order @xmath5 up to @xmath3 in the case of the body - centered - cubic ( @xmath6 ) lattice .",
    "in addition to the conventional ising model ( i.e. with spin @xmath7 ) , we have considered also a few models with spin @xmath8 , and the lattice scalar euclidean field theories with even polynomial self - interaction .",
    "all results for the simple ising system in a field can be readily transcribed into the lattice - gas model language and therefore are of immediate relevance also for the theory of the liquid - gas transition@xcite .",
    "the ht and low - field expansions of the spin-@xmath9 ising models can be transformed@xcite into low - temperature ( lt ) and high - field expansions .    the spin-@xmath9 ising model in an external magnetic field @xmath10",
    "is described by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin variable at the lattice site @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the magnetic moment of a spin , @xmath15 is the exchange coupling .",
    "the first sum extends over all distinct nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , the second sum over all lattice sites .",
    "the conventional ising model is recovered by setting @xmath7 .",
    "the one - component self - interacting lattice scalar field theory is described by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a continuous variable associated to the site @xmath13 and @xmath18 is an even polynomial in the variable @xmath19 . in this study , we have only considered the specific model in which @xmath20 , although we can cover interactions of a more general form .",
    "all these models are expected to belong to the @xmath21 ising universality class , therefore our eextensive set of series expansion data can be used to test the accuracy of the basic hypotheses of critical scaling and universality with respect to the lattice and the interaction structure , by comparing the estimates of the exponents and of universal combinations of critical amplitudes for the various models as well as by forming approximate representations of the equation of state ( es ) . in this study our attitude@xcite is , to some extent , complementary to the current one .",
    "usually , universality is essentially assumed from the outset : for example , in the renormalization group ( rg ) approach@xcite , an appropriate scalar field theory in continuum space is taken as the representative of the ising universality class , as suggested by the independence of the renormalization procedure from the details of the microscopic interaction .",
    "also in ht and montecarlo approaches , attention has been recently focused@xcite on particular continuous- or discrete - spin lattice models which exhibit vanishing ( or very small ) leading non - analytic corrections to scaling@xcite in order to be able to estimate more accurately the physical quantities of interest . in this report",
    ", we prefer to take advantage of our extended expansions to test a wide sample of models , expected to belong to the same universality class , and to show how closely , already at the present orders of expansion , each model approaches the predicted asymptotic scaling and universality properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.ii we briefly characterize our expansions , sketch the method of derivation and list the numerous tests of correctness passed by the series coefficients . in sect .",
    "iii we define the higher - order susceptibilities , whose critical parameters enter into the determination of the scaling equation of state and update an approximate representation of it . in sect .",
    "iv we discuss numerical estimates of exponents , amplitudes and universal combinations of these , that can be computed from the bivariate series . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "the ht series expansion coefficients for the models under study have been derived by a fully computerized algorithm based on the vertex - renormalized linked - cluster ( lc ) method which calculates the mean magnetization per spin in a non - zero magnetic field from the set of all topologically distinct , connected , 1-vertex - irreducible ( 1vi ) , single - rooted graphs@xcite .",
    "we have taken advantage of the bipartite structure of the @xmath22 and the @xmath6 lattices to restrict the generation of graphs to the subset of the bipartite graphs , i.e. to the graphs containing no loops of odd length .    in the past",
    ", the lc method was employed mainly to derive expansions in the absence of magnetic field . in the presence of a field ,",
    "the most extensive@xcite data so far available in @xmath21 were derived indirectly , by transforming@xcite bivariate lt and high - field expansions@xcite into ht and low - field expansions .",
    "this computation was performed only for the @xmath7 ising model , although some lt and high - field data existed also for other values of the spin .",
    "shorter ht expansions in a finite field had also been previously obtained@xcite , only for the @xmath7 model , by a direct expansion of the free energy .",
    "it is worth noting that we are now in a position to follow the opposite route : namely of transforming our bivariate ht data for the spin-@xmath9 ising systems into lt and high - field expansions , thus extending the known results .",
    "our improvements of the presently available ht series in a field are summarized in table [ tab1 ] , in the case of the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 lattices .",
    "similar extensions for the same class of models , in the case of the simple quadratic ( @xmath23 ) lattice and for bipartite lattices in @xmath24 space dimensions , will be discussed elsewhere . the series expansions coefficients will be tabulated in a separate paper .",
    "the feasible correctness checks of our computations are inevitably partial , since the extended expansions include information much wider than that already available in the literature .",
    "the easiest non - trivial check is that our procedure yields the known bivariate expansion of the free energy for the spin @xmath25 ising model in a finite field on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we have also checked that our results agree , through their common extent , with the old data cited above@xcite for the spin @xmath25 ising system in a magnetic field , both on the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 lattices .",
    "otherwise , our results can only be compared with the related data in zero field , in particular with the ht expansions of the free energy and its second field - derivative , both for the ising model with general spin-@xmath9 and for the scalar field model , on the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 lattices , which have been tabulated@xcite through order @xmath26 , while the 4th field - derivative is already known@xcite through @xmath27 for both lattices .",
    "our results agree , through their common extent , also with the expansions of the 6th field derivative in zero field , tabulated@xcite up to order @xmath28 , and of the 8th field - derivative , tabulated@xcite up to order @xmath29 , in the case of the spin @xmath25 model on the @xmath6 lattice .",
    "we have finally checked that our expansions reproduce the @xmath4 lattice calculations of the 6th field - derivative ( known up to order @xmath28 ) , of the 8th ( known up to order @xmath29 ) and of the 10th ( known up to order @xmath30 ) in the case of the @xmath4 lattice scalar field with quartic coupling @xmath31 , which have been tabulated in ref .",

    ", these techniques might prove to be competitive@xcite in the @xmath21 case also for calculations in a nonvanishing field .",
    "we believe , however , that it has been worthwhile to test and develop also a lc approach , which expresses the series coefficients in terms of polynomials in the moments of the single - spin measure and therefore , unlike the finite lattice method , is flexible enough to apply also to non - discrete state models such as the one - component scalar field model@xcite within the ising universality class studied here and , more generally , to the o(n)-symmetric spin@xcite or lattice - field systems in any space dimension .",
    "to give an idea of the strong points of our graphical algorithms , we mention that , using only an ordinary desktop personal quad - processor - computer with a @xmath35 fast memory ( ram ) , our code can complete in seconds all calculations already documented@xcite in the literature ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the whole renormalized calculation presented here , can be completed in a cpu - time of a few days , most of which goes in producing the highest order of expansion . in what follows",

    "<S> we have substantially extended the high - temperature and low - magnetic - field ( and the related low - temperature and high - magnetic - field ) bivariate expansions of the free energy for the conventional three - dimensional ising model and for a variety of other spin systems generally assumed to belong to the same critical universality class . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have also derived the analogous expansions for the ising models with spin @xmath0 and for the lattice euclidean scalar field theory with quartic self - interaction , on the simple cubic and the body - centered cubic lattices . </S>",
    "<S> our bivariate high - temperature expansions , which extend through @xmath1 , enable us to compute , through the same order , all higher derivatives of the free energy with respect to the field , namely all higher susceptibilities . </S>",
    "<S> these data make more accurate checks possible , in critical conditions , both of the scaling and the universality properties with respect to the lattice and the interaction structure and also help to improve an approximate parametric representation of the critical equation of state for the three - dimensional ising model universality class . </S>"
