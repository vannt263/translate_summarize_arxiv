    "since the work on complex networks by strogatz , watts , barabsi and albert ( see @xcite ) many researchers from such distinct fields as statistical mechanics @xcite , molecular biology @xcite , ecology @xcite , physical chemistry @xcite , genetics e.g.  @xcite or social science @xcite have studied the emerging complex structure and the behavior of networks in their respective field of research .",
    "a special subset of scale - free non - equilibrium networks can emerge from a construction procedure in which at each time step @xmath0 one vertex is added and connected to @xmath1 existing vertices with preferential linking .",
    "this preference is proportional to the number of already existing connections of that particular vertex . by definition",
    "the average number of connections remains constant @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of the degree of connections @xmath3 is of particular interest as it provides for the possibility to distinguish different classes .",
    "one observes in scale - free - networks a behavior @xmath4 that was first discussed by simon @xcite and in the context of citations networks by price @xcite .",
    "extensions to a more complex linking procedure @xcite or more general linkage properties @xcite were recently discussed in detail .    to study the evolution of the distribution the continuum approximation is often used . at time @xmath0 the average number of connections @xmath5 of a vertex created at time @xmath6 is in an undirected network @xcite @xmath7    bianconi and barabsi @xcite pointed to the effects of distributions of fitness of individuals to attract new connections .",
    "this can be already regarded as one prototypical example of incomplete information by interpreting the fitness in their model as an incomplete knowledge of all newer vertices about the _",
    "individual _ properties or existence of the _ present _ vertices .",
    "mossa et al.@xcite showed that the power - law behavior might be truncated due to information filtering . in their case",
    "a newly attached vertex is only aware of a certain subset of the existing vertices .",
    "this subset is however chosen randomly for each vertex individually .",
    "therefore the incomplete information has no global properties but is instead a local property .",
    "here we want however to follow another route with two distinct models to deal with the more interesting case that the incomplete information is attached to the new vertices individually and still global with respect to the whole network .",
    "one model will mimic a generic and global effect that is present in all real citation networks while the other describes the influence of individual information unawareness .",
    "for a newly created vertex the only relevant information is a list of existing vertices to connect to and their respective degrees .",
    "incomplete information results in the ignorance of some of those vertices .",
    "this effect is here mediated via an awareness function @xmath8 that makes the newly connected vertex @xmath0 aware of the existing vertex @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath9    eq .  ( [ eq::approx ] ) becomes then @xmath10    while there are many choices for @xmath8 we will propose one particular structure to resemble actual effects in citation networks .",
    "we will further set @xmath11 as this network property has no influence on the scaling exponent @xmath12 in the models .",
    "a newly created link might not be aware of the most recent created entities in the network .",
    "one encounters this situation actually very often : the author of a new www - page can not be aware of other recently created pages that he would like to link to .",
    "search engines do not provide for instantaneous listing of just created pages and therefore authors can find new pages just by chance .",
    "this incomplete information about the vertices of the network results in a selection of older vertices for linking .",
    "we model this by the setting @xmath13 with some constant @xmath14 and @xmath15 the heaviside - step - function .",
    "therefore a newly created vertex is only aware of the oldest @xmath16 fraction of the existing vertices .",
    "while this seems to be at a first glance to strong of an assumption , this is realized in exponentially growing systems like the www : suppose from the current real - time @xmath17 we can not know new pages younger than some period @xmath18 . then all existing pages that are capable of attracting a link are taken from the interval @xmath19 $ ] . as the number of pages obeys however @xmath20",
    "this translates in the @xmath21-notion to @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "here we have set @xmath23 .",
    "recall that the time @xmath0 of eq .",
    "( [ eq::approx ] ) is actually the number of vertices so that we actually draw a vertex from @xmath24 $ ] .    rewriting the definition of @xmath25 we get @xmath26 and see that this function scales with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "we can then set @xmath28 and rewrite equation ( [ eq::phi ] ) to ( with @xmath29 ) @xmath30 @xmath31 is the integral in the denominator @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath32 reflects the fact , that upon creation a new node @xmath33 has only one connection .",
    "the solution of this differential equation is @xmath34 as the function has to be continuous we must have @xmath35 .",
    "we can derive the value for @xmath36 and arrive at @xmath37    the equation for @xmath38 is then @xmath39    by scaling arguments one can prove that in general the relation @xmath40 holds @xcite . using this",
    "we conclude that here @xmath41 .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig::c1 ] which compares this result with computer simulations .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we can further analyze the emerging networks by investigating the shortest - paths in these networks .",
    "figure [ fig::sp ] shows the increase of both the average @xmath42 and the maximum @xmath43 of the shortest path lengths @xcite in independently created networks with increasing @xmath16 above @xmath44 .",
    "a smaller @xmath45 $ ] reduces the number of available vertices in the growth process and the network gets more dense : the shortest path lengths get smaller and the probability of vertices with larger number of connections bigger - as can be seen from the previous result @xmath46 .    for very small @xmath47",
    "we see however an increase in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is an artifact due to our initial setting of the first @xmath48 vertices to form a chain .",
    "while the chain guarantees that none of the first vertices is preferred to another initial vertex , the path lengths are largely influenced now .",
    "for the smallest @xmath49 used here we get an @xmath50 . here",
    "the chain length dominates the path lengths .    .",
    "for every point we sampled over @xmath51 independent networks .",
    "the first @xmath48 vertices where initialized to form a chain , so giving no preferences to any of them . ]",
    "suppose that www - pages are the vertices in this scenario and links are the edges of the network .",
    "this model then takes into account the time that e.g.  search engines need to encounter new web - pages and make the general public aware of those sites .",
    "the anonymity of a vertex @xmath6 is healed over time by sliding into the focus of new vertices as soon as @xmath52 . here",
    "the incomplete information refers to the knowledge of _ every _ new vertex uniformly .",
    "there is also the opposite scenario in which some vertices are aware of the full information ( that is the number of connections all the existing vertices possess ) and others are just ignorant and connect with equal probability to any of the existing ones . here",
    "the incompleteness of information is restricted to a subset of individuals :",
    "suppose that a newly added vertex is with some probability @xmath53 aware of all the connectivities of the other vertices . in this case it is attached with preferential linking described above .",
    "with probability @xmath54 it is connected without preference .",
    "we want to deduce the effect on the connectivity distribution from the master equation for the average number of connections of degree @xmath55 at time @xmath0 @xmath56 \\nonumber\\\\      & & + ( 1-p)\\cdot \\left [ n(k , t ) + \\frac{1}{t } n(k-1,t ) - \\frac{1}{t}n(k , t)\\right ] + \\delta_{k,1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath57 is the average degree of each vertex .",
    "the first term describes the preferential linking with its in- and outflow while the second term provides for the additional connections or loss thereof with equal probability .",
    "notice that there are currently @xmath0 vertices in the network , so @xmath58 is the probability of hitting any one of those .",
    "the third term is finally responsible for the newly added guy. by changing to continuous time we get from eq .",
    "( [ eq::p ] ) @xmath59p(k-1,t )    - \\left [ p\\frac{k}{\\bar{k}}+1-p\\right]p(k-1,t ) + \\delta_{k,1}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the density of vertices with degree @xmath55 at time @xmath0 .",
    "we can now solve for the stationary distribution for @xmath61 .",
    "we arrive at the recursion @xmath62 this is further written as @xmath63 using the relationship @xmath64\\ ] ] for large @xmath55 @xcite we conclude that @xmath65 for large @xmath55 with a divergence for the exponent when approaching @xmath66 as in this case we have no preferential linking at all . in this case the starting master equation ( [ eq::p ] ) leads correctly to the poisson - distribution @xmath67 .",
    "the diverging behavior of the exponent was for instance also found by krapivsky and redner @xcite in their treatment of growing networks with redirection .",
    "figure [ fig::np ] shows the results from computer experiments for this model .",
    "the smaller the @xmath53 the more difficult it is to see any indication of the power - law",
    ".     of degree @xmath55 in networks of size @xmath68 averaged over @xmath69 independent runs .",
    "the data was shifted for a better overview .",
    "the straight line through the data of @xmath70 is the derived result of eq .",
    "( [ eq::p2 ] ) with @xmath71 while the broken line indicates an asymptotic power - law for the cumulative number of a distribution with @xmath72 . ]",
    "in this paper we developed two distinct models to describe the effect of 1 ) global incomplete information caused by penetration rates while constructing a citation network and 2 ) local incomplete information of individual vertices that are attached with a probability of non - knowledge. we derived the scaling behavior of the degree distribution for large degrees in both cases and compared this to computer experiments .",
    "both models approach the analytic value @xcite of @xmath73 when reaching full information .",
    "the incomplete information in the two models does not destroy the scale - free - behavior of the systems while mossa et al.@xcite found a cross - over from scale - free - behavior to an exponential in another model which takes information into account . by comparison",
    "one can see the influence incomplete information may have on the global structure of growing networks .",
    "we will work out particulars on real - world - networks and the influence of incomplete information in a forthcoming study .",
