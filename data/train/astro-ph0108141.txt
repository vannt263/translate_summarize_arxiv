    "it was recognized in the mid - eighties that damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) reveal unique information about the evolutionary history of the universe .",
    "optical surveys of qsos showed that dlas trace the bulk of the observable neutral gas mass at high redshift , and therefore , that they can be used to study the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "a particularly compelling result was that the comoving neutral gas mass density in dlas at redshift @xmath6 was comparable to the luminous mass density observed in galaxies at the current epoch .",
    "there also seemed to be evidence for a decline in the neutral gas mass density from @xmath7 to @xmath8 that extrapolated to the value inferred from gas - rich galaxies at @xmath4 ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; turnshek et al . 1989 ; lanzetta et al . 1991 ; rao & briggs 1993 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence for gas depletion due to star formation , and dlas were thought to trace the evolution of the progenitors of present - day disk galaxies .",
    "however , several studies carried out during the second half of the last decade have shown that the interpretation is not so straightforward .",
    "groundbased surveys can search for dla lines only beyond @xmath9 when the ly@xmath10 line moves into the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "thus , until the recent iue and hst surveys for dlas ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; rao , turnshek , & briggs 1995 ; jannuzi et al .",
    "1998 ; rao & turnshek 2000 , henceforth , rt2000 ) , about 70% of the ly@xmath10 universe was unexplored .",
    "the rt2000 survey , which we discuss in this contribution , more than doubled the number of known low - redshift dlas .",
    "we used a bootstrapping method which relied on the statistics of mgii absorption lines to identify dlas .",
    "the results , although still limited by small number statistics , show that @xmath1 is consistent with remaining constant from redshifts @xmath2 to @xmath3 and that extrapolation to @xmath4 results in a value that is a factor of @xmath5 times higher than what is derived from galaxies at the current epoch .",
    "the dla redshift number density is only marginally consistent with evolution between redshifts @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that dlas may be a slowly evolving population that do not undergo significant gas depletion and , by extension , star formation .",
    "apart from the low - redshift dla statistics , results from metallicity studies , kinematics , and direct imaging of the dlas have shown that the `` dla - disk galaxy '' paradigm is inadequate .",
    "pettini and collaborators ( e.g. pettini et al . 1997 , pettini et al . 1999 ,",
    "pettini et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown that there is no obvious tendency for dla metallicities to increase with decreasing redshift and approach the solar value . however , there is considerable scatter in the individual metallicities which is most likely caused by the wide range of formation histories and galaxy types responsible for the dlas .",
    "in fact , pettini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have also concluded that the known dlas are unlikely to trace the galaxy population responsible for the bulk of the star formation .",
    "prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ; 1998 ) have used high - resolution spectra of the metal - line profiles associated with dlas to argue that the kinematic profiles of the dla absorbing regions are more consistent with models of rotating hi disks than any other single type of model .",
    "the kinematics have also been shown to be consistent with gas in - fall due to merging ( haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 ) , randomly moving clouds in a spherical halo ( mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ) , and multiple gas disks in a common halo ( maller et al .",
    "therefore , it seems most likely that , consistent with other current findings , the kinematics of dla absorbing regions arise from a mix of kinematic structures , including some rotating gaseous disks .",
    "there is now direct evidence from imaging studies that the morphological types of dla galaxies are indeed mixed .",
    "see rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) , turnshek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and nestor et al .",
    "( 2001 , these proceedings ) for ground - based imaging results on some of our low - redshift dla fields .",
    "hst images of other low - redshift dla absorbers have also revealed a mixed population ( le brun et al .",
    "1997 ; bouch et al .",
    "turnshek , rao , & nestor ( 2001 , these proceedings ) compare the properties of low - redshift dla galaxies to the properties of gas - rich galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "thus , there has been a shift in our interpretation of the nature of the dla galaxy population , consistent with the idea that dlas arise in giant hydrogen clouds that could be associated with any type of galaxy or protogalaxy ( khersonsky & turnshek 1996 ) . here",
    ", we elaborate on some of the statistical results from our dla survey .",
    "we recently completed an efficient non - traditional ( but unbiased ) hst survey to discover dlas at redshifts @xmath0 ( rt2000 ) .",
    "our survey relied on observations of ly@xmath10 absorption in identified mgii systems ( which can be identified from the ground for @xmath13 ) , where the incidence of mgii is known as a function of the mgii@xmath142796 rest equivalent width , @xmath15  ( e.g. steidel & sargent 1992 ) . the empirical fact that all dla absorbers have mgii absorption ( turnshek et al . 1989 ; lu et al .",
    "1993 ; wolfe et al . 1993",
    "; lu & wolfe 1994 ) greatly improves the efficiency of searches for dla at low redshift . with our survey technique",
    ", we uncovered 12 dla lines in 87 mgii systems with @xmath15  @xmath16   ( a success rate of @xmath1714% ) .",
    "two more dlas were discovered serendipitously . in total",
    "our survey increased the number of known low - redshift dla absorbers more than two - fold ( previously known low - redshift dlas were mostly identified via 21 cm absorption ) .",
    "since we observed the fraction of mgii systems with dla , we determined the incidence of dlas at low redshift by bootstrapping from the mgii statistics . by fitting voigt damping profiles to the ly@xmath10 lines in our uv spectra",
    ", we deduced @xmath18 for each dla system and determined the low - redshift cosmological neutral gas mass density of dla absorbers .",
    "specifically , our survey results indicate :    \\(1 ) approximately 50% of the systems with @xmath15  @xmath190.5   _ and _ feii @xmath20 @xmath190.5   have dla absorption ( figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , we uncovered a new selection criterion for the identification of dlas .",
    "moreover , all the non - dlas in this regime have hi column densities @xmath21 atoms @xmath22",
    ". we also found that with the exception of the known @xmath23 21 cm absorber towards 3c 286 which has unusually low metal - line equivalent widths ( @xmath15  @xmath24   and @xmath25  , cohen et al . 1994 ) , all of the dlas lie in the upper - right region of the plot where @xmath15  @xmath26 and @xmath27  .",
    "\\(2 ) the incidence of dlas per unit redshift , @xmath28 , is observed to decrease with decreasing redshift ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the observed trend in @xmath28 implies significant evolution only if the @xmath4 data point , which is derived from 21 cm observations of gas - rich spirals ( rao & briggs 1993 ) , is included in the analysis .",
    "two power laws of the form @xmath29 are shown . for @xmath30 cosmologies , @xmath28 is consistent with no intrinsic evolution if @xmath31 for @xmath32 or if @xmath33 for @xmath34 . the solid line in figure 2 , which goes through the @xmath4 data point ,",
    "has exponent @xmath35 and indicates significant evolution .",
    "the dashed line , which excludes the @xmath4 data point , has @xmath36 and is only marginally consistent with evolution .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath4 ( the open triangle ) results in a value that is @xmath37 times larger than the observed incidence at @xmath4 .",
    "\\(3 ) the cosmological mass density of neutral gas in low - redshift dla absorbers , @xmath1 , is found to be comparable to that observed at high redshift ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the error bars are large because @xmath38 is very sensitive to the small number of systems which have the highest column densities . for @xmath34 , @xmath38 is a factor of @xmath5 times larger than the value for @xmath39 inferred from local 21 cm observations .",
    "\\(4 ) the hi column density distribution ( cdd ) of the low - redshift dla absorber population is very different in comparison to high - redshift dla absorbers , and in comparison to the column density distribution inferred from local spirals ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the low - redshift dlas exhibit a significantly larger fraction of very high column density systems in comparison to determinations at both high redshift and locally . at no redshift",
    "does the cdd fall - off in proportion to @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "an @xmath40@xmath41 fall - off is theoretically predicted for disk - like systems ( e.g. milgrom 1988 ) and this is , in fact , observed locally in spiral samples ( rao & briggs 1993 ; zwaan et al .",
    "1999 ) .    despite the increase in the number of known low - redshift dlas ,",
    "the statistics are still dominated by small numbers leading to large error bars on @xmath28 and @xmath1 .",
    "it could be argued that these quantities are also consistent with a real decrease between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , the cdd at low redshift is very significantly different from that at high redshift .",
    "there is only a 2.8% probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "also , the low - redshift dla sample is different from the local spiral galaxy population at the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "in summary , the observational results on dlas over the past decade have shown that their redshift number density , cosmological mass density , and metallicities show little evolution from redshifts @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we have also seen that dla galaxies cover a wide range of gas - rich morphological types from predominantly dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies to some spirals .    that they are a slowly evolving population implies that either : ( 1 ) they do not trace the bulk of the galaxy population responsible for star formation , i.e. , they are a different population than the galaxies that are used to determine the star formation history of the universe , or ( 2 ) that the galaxy population responsible for star formation is a small subset of the dla galaxy population .",
    "if the first possibility holds , this is probably the result of a selection effect in that optical surveys of qsos preferentially probe lines of sight that are relatively dust free .",
    "these sight lines must avoid star forming regions that are enshrouded in metal - enriched dust ( pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ) . indeed , the models of pei , fall , & hauser ( 1999 ) imply that as much as @xmath4070% of the neutral gas mass is being missed by dla surveys . however , the recent study of dlas detected in a sample of radio - selected quasar spectra by ellison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests that the effect might be less important .",
    "our results on the incidence of dlas show that @xmath28 is only marginally consistent with evolution from @xmath11 to @xmath42 , and that the extrapolated value of @xmath43 at @xmath4 is higher than that deduced from 21 cm emission data of nearby galaxies by a factor of @xmath37 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we also found that @xmath1 does not evolve from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and that the extrapolated value at @xmath4 is a factor of @xmath406.5 times higher than the neutral gas mass density deduced from gas - rich galaxies at the present epoch ( figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , the qso absorption - line results are highly inconsistent with the results from 21 cm observations of local galaxies . recently , churchill ( 2001 ) used hst archival spectra to determine the incidence of mgii systems at @xmath44 and , based on the rt2000 method of bootstrapping from mgii statistics and the assumption of no evolution in the mgii - to - dla statistics , derived a value for @xmath45 which is essentially equivalent to the rt2000 value for @xmath46 .",
    "he further noted that if the cdd of dlas did not evolve from @xmath12 to @xmath47 , then @xmath48 would also be consistent with the rt2000 result for @xmath49 .",
    "the implication , then , would be that @xmath1 is constant from @xmath2 to nearly the current epoch , i.e. , @xmath47 . if the churchill ( 2001 ) results",
    "are confirmed with follow - up observations of the corresponding ly@xmath10 lines then the discrepancy between the qso absorption line results and 21 cm emission measurements of local galaxies would have to be explained .",
    "it is possible that we are so dominated by errors from the statistics of small numbers , that our sample just happened to have a higher fraction of the highest column density systems by sheer chance .",
    "as mentioned above , the churchill ( 2001 ) result on @xmath50 was derived assuming that the cdd of dlas did not evolve from @xmath12 to @xmath51 .",
    "so that result is also subject to question in the same way .",
    "the only way around this is to conduct larger surveys for dlas at low redshift .",
    "in addition to improving the statistical uncertainties , this would permit a better determination of the shape of the hi cdd at large column densities , effectively allowing a determination of the maximum hi column density . understanding this turn - down in column density is important for the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "it is also worth reiterating that the redshift interval @xmath52 includes the most recent @xmath4070% of the age of the universe .",
    "we certainly require more than a dozen or so dlas to do justice to this era .",
    "it might be argued that our technique of selecting from a mgii sample biases the dla sample towards higher column densities .",
    "however , we have shown that our data are not consistent with this ( see rt2000 ) .",
    "there is no trend between mgii @xmath15  and hi column density . while we used a @xmath15  detection threshold of 0.3 , all but one of our dlas have @xmath15  @xmath53  ( the one system has @xmath15",
    "@xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , we believe that our empirically - determined cut - off in @xmath15  is sound .",
    "it was also suggested by frank briggs at this conference that a higher @xmath15  cut - off should be used to search for dlas since they are probably more indicative of the presence of a dla system .",
    "moreover , the steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) mgii study showed that systems with @xmath15  @xmath55 evolved away faster than those with @xmath15",
    "@xmath53 . this might , he argued , result in a smaller value for @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the results on @xmath49 from the two @xmath15threshold samples in our data set are consistent with each other ; of course , the error bars for the @xmath15  @xmath55  sample are even larger .",
    "it is also a concern that our qso samples might be influenced by gravitational lensing bias ; dla galaxies magnify qsos , preferentially introducing them into optically selected samples .",
    "le brun et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown this effect to be less than 0.3 magnitudes for their sample of 7 dla galaxies .",
    "they also point out that our qso sample is brighter than theirs and that magnification bias may , therefore , be more important for our sample .",
    "the qsos with the highest column density dlas in our sample have not been imaged with hst , and so the possibility of lensing by the dla galaxies has not been studied with the greatest possible sensitivity .",
    "on the other hand , our ground - based studies suggest that dla galaxies are not highly luminous , and therefore , massive galaxies .    in any case",
    ", it is clear that in addition to increasing dla sample sizes , biases due to mgii selection , dust obscuration , and the effect of gravitational lensing could be assessed more carefully .",
    "we should also re - examine the @xmath4 statistics . in rao & briggs ( 1993 )",
    "we used the best available optical luminosity functions known at that time in conjunction with empirical hi mass  optical luminosity relations of gas - rich galaxies to calculate the hi mass density locally .",
    "this is the value plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the upper error bar has been modified slightly as explained in rao , turnshek , & briggs ( 1995 ) .",
    "fall & pei ( 1993 ) derived approximately the same value using mean values of the local luminosity density and @xmath56 .",
    "this exercise was repeated by natarajan & pettini ( 1997 ) using more recent optical luminosity functions and they confirmed the rao & briggs ( 1993 ) result . for comparison ,",
    "the results on @xmath39 were @xmath57 ( rao & briggs 1993 ) , @xmath58 ( fall & pei 1993 ) , and @xmath59 ( natarajan & pettini 1997 ) .",
    "direct measurements of the local gas mass density using hi 21 cm emission surveys have also been found to be consistent with the above results .",
    "the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss , zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ) performed the most sensitive search for local 21 cm emission to date , being 5 times more sensitive than the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs ) of rosenberg & schneider ( 2000 ) , although the latter covered a larger volume .",
    "the limiting column density of the zwaan et al .",
    "survey was @xmath60 @xmath22 at the @xmath61 level for gas filling the telescope beam , and they had the capability of detecting hi masses of @xmath62m@xmath63 at 7@xmath64 mpc",
    ". for comparison , hipass , which is a blind 21 cm survey of the southern sky , reached a limiting column density of @xmath65 @xmath22 at the @xmath66 level and a mass limit of @xmath67 m@xmath63 at 7@xmath64 mpc ( kilborn , webster , & staveley - smith 1999 ; kilborn 2001 ) .",
    "all three 21 cm surveys have been used to construct the local hi mass function .",
    "the faint end slope of the hi mass function has been the focus of much debate since it bears directly on the values of @xmath39 and @xmath68 ( figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "moreover , a large faint end slope might imply the existence of a new dwarf galaxy population that has not been identified optically . for comparison , zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derive a slope of @xmath69 , rosenberg & schneider ( 2001 , these proceedings ) get @xmath70 , while kilborn ( 2001 ) derives @xmath71 ( where @xmath10 is the standard schechter luminosity function parameter ) .",
    "the integral of the hi mass function is an estimate of the total hi mass density at @xmath4 , and its ratio with the critical mass density at the current epoch gives @xmath72 .",
    "a correction for a neutral gas composition of 75% h and 25% he by mass then gives @xmath39 .",
    "the results on @xmath39 for the three surveys are @xmath73 ( zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath74 ( kilborn 2001 ) , and @xmath75 ( from data in rosenberg & schneider 2001 , these proceedings ) .    thus , the value of @xmath39 derived from optical luminosity functions is consistent with the value derived from hi mass functions . as expected , the hi mass functions with @xmath76 result in slightly larger values for @xmath39 , but only at the @xmath77 level .",
    "the similarity between the hi mass function estimated from ahiss with that derived from optical luminosity functions ( briggs & rao 1993 ) led zwaan et al . ( 1997 ) to conclude that there is no large population of hi - rich galaxies ( e.g. low surface brightness or dwarf ) that have been missed by optical galaxy surveys .",
    "see also zwaan , briggs , & sprayberry ( 2001 ) who show that the optical luminosity function of hi selected galaxies is in agreement with the luminosity function of optically selected late - type galaxies .",
    "however , based on the sensitivities of the three 21 cm surveys discussed above , the possibility of there being objects with masses lower than @xmath78 m@xmath63 that contain dla column densities , but that have a mean column density less than @xmath79 @xmath22 within the telescope beam can not be ruled out .",
    "rosenberg & schneider ( 2001 , these proceedings ) have also suggested that the faint - end slope of the adbs hi mass function , @xmath71 , is large enough to make the contribution of low - hi - mass galaxies important to the dla cross - section at @xmath4 .",
    "they derive a value for @xmath68 that is a factor of @xmath80 higher than our estimate from a complete sample of 27 gas - rich galaxies ( see rao , turnshek , & briggs 1995 and turnshek , rao , & nestor 2001 , these proceedings ) . while the adbs sample covers a larger range in hi masses ( @xmath81m@xmath82 to @xmath83m@xmath82 ) compared to our sample ( @xmath84m@xmath82 to @xmath85m@xmath82 ) , the cross - sectional areas of our galaxies at the @xmath86 atoms @xmath22 hi column density contour are systematically lower by a factor of @xmath87",
    ". this might possibly account for the larger value of @xmath68 that they derive from their data set .",
    "observations over the past several years have led us to a new paradigm for dlas , namely , that dlas trace clouds of neutral gas whose properties have not changed significantly between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and that these clouds arise in a variety of gas - rich galaxy types .",
    "there exists a discrepancy of about a factor of 6.5 between the cosmological neutral gas mass density at @xmath4 as inferred from dla statistics and 21 cm emission measurements of local galaxies . whether this discrepancy is due to small - number statistics of dlas at low redshift , a real selection difference , or real evolution",
