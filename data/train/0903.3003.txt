    "the paper presents the model of an elementary particle and particularly the model of the neutral nucleon and its excited states .",
    "since the model is atomic - like i will give a concise reminder both of the history of the models of an atom and of a neutron which still overlap until the present day .",
    "possibly the first model of an atom in the 20-th century was kelvin s static one @xcite of a sphere of uniformly distributed positive electricity with embedded discrete electrons , followed closely by the thomson s model of `` the pudding with raisin muffins in it '' @xcite .",
    "models also appeared at the end of the 19-th century , stimulated by empirical facts suggesting the complexity of the structure of the atom and its composition from smaller components @xcite .",
    "as a result , both the theoretical intuition and the empirical indications prompted the sense of the electron to thomson .",
    "he disagreed with the idea of the planetary `` point planets '' model of the atom but probably was influenced by maxwell s considerations on saturn s rings @xcite .",
    "hence , contrary to kelvin s model , the one by thomson @xcite is not static and one of its characteristics is the motion of a ring of _ n _ negatively charged particles ( electrons @xcite , as they were called by stoney @xcite ) , which are set within an uniformly charged sphere ( with the radius of the order of @xmath0 m ) having a number of particles which vary from ring to ring .",
    "the attractive force of the positively charged sphere and the repulsion of the negatively charged electrons arranged in a series of parallel rings were to guarantee the stability of the system .",
    "the strange characteristic of the model is that if the number of the negative particles is larger than 5 , some of them must be set in the central position of the sphere yet not necessarily strictly in the center , or else the movement in the atom becomes unstable .",
    "this problem still arouses interest until the present day @xcite .",
    "+ thomson s atom has two types of vibrations : the first one connected with the movement of electrons along their orbits and the second one developing out of the distortion of a ring from its equilibrium circular shape in a particular spherical shell .",
    "although the model does not explain the characteristic regularities of the observed spectral lines and the deflection of an electron when it passes through matter , it was regarded as a sufficient one by many physicists until the end of the first decade of the 20th century .",
    "this was due to the fact that he found a close relation between the occupation of the electrons inside rings formed in the concentric shells and the regularities inside the mendeleev s periodic table .",
    "however , at the same time some scientists considered that the planetary model of the atom was more appropriate .",
    "+ in 1920 rutherford considered his model of the neutron in relation to the compressed hydrogen atom in the core of a star and presented his hypothesis on the structure of the neutron @xcite .",
    "he perceived the neutron as an electron pressed into the interior of a proton hence his model of the neutron was more in line with thomson s idea of the atom than of the planetary kind . in 1932",
    "chadwick experimentally confirmed rutherford s hypothesis on the existence of the neutron .",
    "+ in the period from 1925 to 1928 there emerged three formulations of quantum mechanics : heisenberg s @xcite , dirac s @xcite and schrdinger s @xcite .",
    "they were developed nearly at the same time .",
    "the schrdinger equation provides a direct representation of the mechanical system using the notion of the wave function for a particular state . here",
    "the eigenstate functions form the orthogonal reference frame in the hilbert space in which the wave function and its time evolution can be analyzed .",
    "the specific schrdinger s substantial approach to the square modulus of the wave function gave the name wave mechanics to his interpretation of quantum mechanics which is in line with de broglie s theory of phase waves @xcite .",
    "+ two questions about the main characteristics of the type of the models of an atom or nucleon built in these formalisms arise .",
    "firstly , are they thomson s with deep overlapping of constituent fields or planetary - like , for which the constituent fields do not overlap so deeply ? on the surface , all of them carry some planetary features , especially if the hamiltonians of the particular models are analyzed .",
    "this may be easily understood because in this respect they are classical mechanics descendants , yet in their main idea connected with the nonlocality of the wave function they are thomson oriented , regardless of the fact whether the interpretation of the wave function is schrdinger s or copenhagen s .",
    "indeed , in the atom the electron wave function is deeply embedded in the nucleus field .",
    "secondly , what is the geometry of the manifold ( space or space - time ) which forms the background arena for the disputed configurations of fields ?",
    "the common feature of thomson s and schrdinger s like models of the atom is the homogeneity of their space - time structure .",
    "we will come back to this problem in the passage below .",
    "+ now , let us return to the neutron .",
    "since it seemed that quantum mechanics did not permit a consistent representation of the neutron as a bound state of the proton and electron , the before mentioned rutherford s conception of the structure of the neutron has been rejected by the majority of physicists . yet , until now attempts have been made to restore this model .",
    "for instance such attempts are connected with the construction of a covering of quantum mechanics known as hadronic mechanics @xcite for the specific objective of achieving a consistent quantitative treatment of nonlocal , nonlinear and nonpotential effects in deep wave - overlappings of particles at short distances .",
    "as far as the quantum models of the neutron are considered , the most popular is the quantum field theory version of the bag model .",
    "setting aside the difficulties of this model with the determination of the spin of the nucleon we give some literature references @xcite only citing after @xcite : `` ... all spin parts @xmath1 $ ] have to add to @xmath2 which is incredible in the light of the present day experiments .",
    "this may indicate that some underlying symmetries , unknown at present , are playing a role in forming the various contributing parts such that the final sum rule gives the fermion @xmath2 value '' .",
    "+ another story is partly connected with the name of riemann . in his lecture",
    "entitled `` on the hypotheses that lie at the foundations of geometry '' @xcite , given in 1854 , he emphasized that the truth about space has to be discovered from physical experience .",
    "the clue is that he noted that the geometry of space could be highly irregular at very small distances , yet appearing smooth at the observed ones .",
    "he wrote : `` space [ in the large ] if one ascribes to it a constant curvature , is necessarily finite , provided only that this curvature has a positive value , however small ...  .",
    "it is quite conceivable that the geometry of space in the very small does not satisfy the axioms of [ euclidean ] geometry ...  '' . + but the story of the atom and nucleon may be told and retold ( at least up to now ) in many ways @xcite .",
    "not that all of them are right .",
    "the latest attractive model of the ( hydrogen ) atom , based on the isomorphism between maxwell and dirac formalisms ( or rather on optics - mechanics isomorphism called hamilton s analogy ) , is connected with the name of sallhofer @xcite .",
    "he worked out the formal mathematical strong similarity ( i would not call it identity ) , in the minkowski space , between electrodynamics and wave mechanics by means of which he proved that the hydrogen atom might be seen as a pair of mutually refracting electromagnetic waves .",
    "previously this similarity was pointed out with amusement by sakurai @xcite . below the model of a neutral nucleon",
    "will be presented which is more planetary ( fields do not overlap very deeply ) and incorporates the riemann s idea of space .",
    "the metric of the underlying space - time was previously obtained in @xcite where a six - dimensional kaluza ",
    "klein type model at the classical level is considered . in them",
    "the static spherically symmetric solution to the coupled six - dimensional einstein and klein - gordon equations was derived in the presence of the basic massless dilaton field @xmath3 which forms a kind of ground field for the self - field of gravitation , the notions of which were discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the solutions presented in @xcite are parameterized by parameter @xmath4 which has similar dynamical consequences as mass @xmath5 @xcite , i.e. its existence would be perceived by an observer in the same way as invisible mass which could be the extended `` center '' of a particle . because the solution is horizon free",
    "hence it is fundamentally different from the four - dimensional schwarzschild one .",
    "the idea of the six - dimensional space - time re - enters the physics occasionally @xcite-@xcite . yet the motivations for choosing the six - dimensional models were diverse .",
    "foe instance in @xcite nishino , salam and sezgin suggested that one may obtain the fermion spectrum in four - dimensions within the framework of d=6 , @xmath6 kaluza - klein supergravity .",
    "a six - dimensional model of the kaluza - klein theory was also previously investigated by maka and syska @xcite , and by ivashchuk , melnikov and bronnikov @xcite .",
    "recently sparling @xcite has followed the concept of @xmath7 dimensional structure of the space - time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , models described in @xcite contain the time component with two additional time dimensions .",
    "however there is a way to extend the four - dimensional space - time to the multi - dimensional one via the fisherian statistical analysis .",
    "few years ago frieden proved @xcite that the fisher information channel capacity is the statistical ancestor of the kinematical part of the well known field theory models . using the channel capacity notion , which is inherently connected with the internal parametric space of the sample ( collected by the particle alone ) , and two informational principles , the structural and the variational one , frieden obtained the klein - gordon equation of motion with the proper relativistic dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the structural information principle has been recently proven in @xcite .",
    "the point is that the channel capacity which has turned out to be the kinematical part of the action of any field theory model is additive both in the minkowskian @xmath8 and the sample @xmath9 ( parametric ) indices @xcite .",
    "this enables the partition of the channel capacity @xmath10 into two parts , one for the four - dimensional space - time and the other for the inner parametric space of the sample whose dimension depends on the spinorial representation of the field @xcite .",
    "when we note by @xmath11 the added fluctuations of the data @xmath12 ( collected by the system alone ) from the expectation positions @xmath13 @xcite , then it can be proven that it takes the following form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the original field amplitudes in the sample and multiplication , the likelihood of the sample is calculated . ]",
    "@xcite and @xmath16 are the original fisherian variables .",
    "the amplitudes are factorized as follows @xmath17 and the metric tensor @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is obtained effectively from this procedure @xcite .",
    "factor @xmath20 in the kinematical form of @xmath10 signifies the fisher information origin of the action , yet it does not enter into the equation of motion @xcite as it is also factored out from the structural information @xcite . + for the complex scalar field the dimension @xmath21 of the extra parametric space is equal to @xmath22 . in this way the six - dimensionality of the space having the mixed space - time and parametric character , is chosen .",
    "hence the model with the internal space geometry of the two - dimensional torus parameterized by two angles will be presented .",
    "this provides us with geometry of the internal space , which in sections  3 and 4 enables the description of the spinorial field . in @xcite biesiada , maka and",
    "syska showed that the six - dimensionality of this space - time enables the self - consistency of the background solution of the coupled einstein and klein - gordon equations with internal space , compactified in a non - homogeneous manner .",
    "for the sake of clarity , the summary of @xcite is presented below in section  2 . in sections  3 and 4",
    "the model will raise a new issue on the wave - mechanical analysis of the possible general structure of a particle . in section  4 its application to the description of the neutron and its excited states",
    "is presented . in general , statistical models which one can obtain in this way",
    "are of the kaluza - klein type with four - dimensional space - time and @xmath21-dimensional internal ( parametric ) space .",
    "in @xcite a @xmath23 six - dimensional field theory has been considered ( see also @xcite ) which comprises the gravitational self field described by a metric tensor , @xmath18 , and a real massless `` basic '' scalar ( dilatonic ) field , @xmath3 .",
    "we have decomposed the action into two parts : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the einstein  hilbert action and @xmath26 is the action for a real massless scalar ( dilatonic ) field with the lagrangian density equal to @xmath27 . in eq.([row_dzialanie - eh - fi ] ) @xmath28 denotes the determinant of the metric tensor , @xmath29 is the curvature scalar of the six - dimensional ( in general curved ) space - time , and @xmath30 denotes the coupling constant of the six - dimensional theory , analogous to the familiar newtonian gravity constant .",
    "+ by extremalizing the action given by eq.([row_dzialanie - eh - fi ] ) we obtain the einstein equations @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the einstein tensor , @xmath33 is the six - dimensional ricci tensor , @xmath29 is the curvature scalar and @xmath34 is the energy - momentum tensor of a real scalar ( dilatonic ) field @xmath3 which is given by @xmath35 variation of the total action @xmath36 with respect to the field @xmath3 gives the klein - gordon equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the tensor dual to @xmath18 .",
    "now consider the six - dimensional space - time which is a topological product of the curved four - dimensional physical space - time ( with the metric @xmath39 ) and the internal compactified space ( with the metric @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore the metric tensor can be factorized as @xmath41 the four - dimensional diagonal part is assumed to be that of a spherically symmetric geometry @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are ( at this stage ) two arbitrary functions .",
    "analogously , we take the two - dimensional internal part to be @xmath45 the six - dimensional coordinates @xmath46 are denoted by @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the usual time coordinate , @xmath50 @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 are the familiar three - dimensional spherical coordinates in the macroscopic space ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 are coordinates in the internal two - dimensional parametric space and @xmath55 is the `` radius '' of this internal space .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 is the function of the radius @xmath57 in the external three - dimensional space .",
    "the internal space is a 2-dimensional topological torus with @xmath57-dependent parameter @xmath58 . using eqs.([row_7])-([row_8 ] )",
    ", we can calculate the components of the ricci tensor .",
    "they are given in appendix  a.    now we seek for a solution of the einstein equations ( see eq.([row_3 ] ) ) with the ricci tensor given in appendix  a by eqs.([row_10])-([row_14 ] ) , with @xmath59 , and with the following boundary conditions @xmath60 which at the spatial infinity reproduces the flat external four - dimensional minkowski space - time and the static internal space of `` radius '' @xmath61 which is of the order calculated in section  4 . we also suppose that the scalar field @xmath3 is the function of the radius @xmath57 alone , @xmath62 , and we impose the following boundary condition for the scalar field @xmath3 : @xmath63 which supplements boundary conditions ( [ row_16 ] ) for the metric components .    by virtue of eqs.([row_4 ] ) and ( [ row_dzialanie - eh - fi ] ) it is easy to see that the only nonvanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xmath64    consequently , it is easy to verify that the self - consistent solution of the coupled einstein ( [ row_3 ] ) and klein - gordon ( [ row_5 ] ) equations is @xmath65 @xmath66 hence it results that the only nonzero component of the ricci tensor ( see eqs.([row_10])-([row_14 ] ) in appendix  a ) is @xmath67 .",
    "so the curvature scalar @xmath29 is equal to @xmath68 where @xmath4 is the real constant , with the dimensionality of length , whose value is to be taken from the observation of each particular system ( but see section  4 ) .",
    "we notice that all of the six diagonal einstein equations ( [ row_3 ] ) have shrunk to just one @xmath69 now we can rewrite the metric tensor in the form @xmath70 with its determinant equal to @xmath71 to summarize we notice that the real massless `` basic '' free scalar field @xmath72 ( see eq.([row_22 ] ) ) can be the source of the nonzero metric tensor as in eq.([row_26 ] ) .",
    "only when the constant @xmath4 is equal to zero , the solutions ( [ row_20 ] )  ( [ row_22 ] ) become trivial and the six - dimensional space - time is ricci flat .",
    "it is worth noting that since ( with the solutions given by eqs.([row_20 ] ) and ( [ row_22 ] ) ) the components @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the ricci tensor ( appendix  a ) are equal to zero for all values of @xmath4 , the internal space is always ricci flat .",
    "however , we must not neglect the internal space because its `` radius '' @xmath75 is a function of @xmath57 and the two spaces , external and internal , are therefore `` coupled '' .",
    "only when @xmath76 are these two spaces `` decoupled '' , and the four - dimensional space - time becomes minkowski flat is not equal to zero , our four - dimensional external space - time is curved .",
    "its scalar curvature @xmath77 can be given by eq.([row_24 ] ) , i.e. @xmath78 . ] .",
    "the self consistent solution given by eqs.([row_22 ] ) and ( [ row_26 ] ) of the coupled einstein and klein - gordon equations is unique . to answer the question on the stability of this self - consistent gravity - dilatonic configuration",
    "let us calculate its energy : @xmath79 where using eqs.([row_19])-([row_27 ] ) we obtain : @xmath80 with @xmath81 the integral of @xmath82 does not converge on @xmath83 , hence the self consistent solution ( [ row_22 ] ) and ( [ row_26 ] ) can not be obtained in the limit @xmath84 , from the convergent solutions around @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "+ if we depart from the self consistent solution then a similar result can be obtained from the information analysis in the following way . from the notion of the fisher information @xcite",
    ", we notice that @xmath61 is ( for @xmath86 , see eq.([row_20 ] ) ) the characteristic dimension of the inner parametric space , i.e. the radius of the expected value of the position of the system . in the frieden analysis @xmath57",
    "is the added fluctuation to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "hence if we assume that the fluctuation @xmath57 is not smaller than the expected value @xmath61 then the physical limit for the fluctuation @xmath57 is @xmath87 . in eq.([q ] ) the cutoff @xmath88 can be taken which leads to @xmath89 .",
    "therefore @xmath90 is finite and its value could be even small in contradistinction to the infinite value obtained in eq.([q ] ) for @xmath91 in the self consistent case .",
    "hence , we see that the unique self consistent solution given by eqs.([row_22 ] ) and ( [ row_26 ] ) can not be destabilized to yield any other .",
    "+ let us also notice that in eq.([config energy ] ) the partition of @xmath92 into two parts can be obtained by using the fisher information formalism developed for physical models by frieden @xcite . according to @xcite @xmath93",
    "is connected with the fisherian kinematical degrees of freedom of the gravitational configuration whereas @xmath94 with its structural degrees of freedom .",
    "+ to conclude this section it is worth noting that the metric given by eq.([row_26 ] ) , with the dilatonic field given by eq.([row_22 ] ) , serves , under further conditions discussed below , as a background fields configuration .",
    "this metric appears in the equation of motions for all new fields which weakly enter the system .",
    "until now the calculations were fully self - consistent . the model presented below",
    "adds a new scalar field to the system . yet , since it procures big analytical complications the model will stop being fully self - consistent .",
    "this means among others that we will decline from making the self - consistent correction of the metric ( [ row_26 ] ) received in section  2 .",
    "therefore the following calculations are made totally on the basis of the wave - mechanical approach .",
    "let us investigate the klein ",
    "gordon relativistic wave equation for the motion of a scalar particle with a wave function @xmath95 and mass @xmath96 ( for @xmath97 it would be a @xmath98-dimensional tachion ) , @xmath99 in the six - dimensional space - time given by the central gravitational field described by the metric , @xmath18 , given by eq.([row_26 ] ) with its determinant given by eq.([row_27 ] ) .",
    "this metric tensor is used in the above klein  gordon equation as the background metric only .",
    "hence we neglect the modification of the einstein equations . therefore a particle described by the @xmath95 wave function moves without changing the metric @xmath18 in reciprocal action .",
    "this is called the wave - mechanical approach . _ but to make our calculations self - consistent by the inclusion of the einstein equations coupled to klein - gordon equation , we should follow the pattern of the previous section for all scalar fields ( particles ) which have the mass @xmath96 and are inherently tied up by strong interaction ( compare section  [ bounding_energy ] )",
    ". this procedure should give the self - consistent change of the metric tensor @xmath18 .",

    "+ using eqs.([row_26 ] )  and  ( [ row_27 ] ) , we can rewrite the klein - gordon equation as follows : @xmath100 in order to isolate the time dependence , the standard procedure of the separation of variables is performed with the following factorization of @xmath95 @xmath101 in this way , we obtain the set of stationary states . as the result of further separation in the three - dimensional spherical coordinates @xmath102 of the macroscopic space and in @xmath103 coordinates of the internal two - dimensional space described by the factorization @xmath104",

    "it is not difficult to verify that for @xmath118 and @xmath120 the only solution of the stationary klein - gordon equation eq.([5 ] ) alone , vanishing in infinity ( although not normalizable ) , exists for @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for the radial part of @xmath95",

    "in this way we formally obtain @xcite up to @xmath124 the same solution which follows from the classical klein - gordon equation for the dilaton field ( see eq.([row_5 ] ) ) . yet",
    "now the field is a scalar one , hence the energy of the configuration ( [ pcd7 ] ) is positive and equals : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the @xmath127 component of the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field @xmath95 .",

    "+ yet , a similar conclusion would not be true for @xmath135 even for @xmath119 .",

    "the dimension of the extra parametric space is equal to @xmath22 .",

    "this statement appears to be sensible , especially in the light of the agreement of the order of the discrepancies between energies of the states belonging to the same column and different rows , which are of the order found in the experiment .",
    "as the spacial configurations for the first column in the table  1 are the most simple ones ( @xmath227 ) hence the feeling is that only they should lie in the neighborhoods of the true states ( see also the discussion after eq.([klein - gordon2 ] ) ) .",
    ".values of energies @xmath241 mev for the ground state and excited states of the neutron as the function of the total angular momentum number @xmath191 and internal quantum number @xmath108 . for the neutron itself",

    "+ the important result is that for fixed @xmath191 and @xmath159 , the increase of the energy @xmath241 of the configuration causes the system to become more tightened ( as the ratio @xmath250 decreases ) and simultaneously its gravitational bounding energy bigger . as an example , for the neutron and its excited states ( with @xmath251 and @xmath227 ) this result has been presented in the first and in the two last columns of the table  1 ( in bold ) .",
    "+ the model could be applied to the other known particles also , yet the present calculations show that the best agreement is achieved for the neutron and its excited states .",

    "so , in this case we notice the worse matching with the experimental values @xcite than in the case of the neutron . the explanation of this fact might be that the gravitational factor in the structure of the neutron , which is the lowest known barionic neutral ground state , is most decisive than in the case of other neutral barions .",
    "the principal problem seems to be connected with the ladder of the energy state values in each particular row since in each row few of them or may be only one are physical .",
    "this problem might be connected with the zeroing of the term with the first derivative of the metric tensor and hence with the removal of the first derivative of the radial wave function @xmath264 on passing from eq.([klein - gordon2 ] ) to eq.([x ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , after this zeroing , the weak limit approximation was invented , leading effectively to the introduction of an extra force term ( which is equal to the neglected one with the opposite sign ) connected with the mathematics of the weak approximation only .",
    "the addition of this unphysical extra force into the system results in appearance of row ladders of the unphysical states",
    ". yet the unphysical differences between states of the ladder in one particular row with the established value of @xmath108 are two order of magnitude smaller than the physical ones from the columns .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the differences in one row appear as the result of the change in the value of @xmath159 .",
    "now , according to section  [ weak interaction limit ] the orbital angular momentum @xmath159 survived with the third term @xmath265 of eq.([klein - gordon2 ] ) .",
    "yet it survived inconsistently because the first term @xmath266 of this equation , also proportional to @xmath267 , has been neglected .",
    "since the third term of eq.([klein - gordon2 ] ) is , for @xmath175 , of the order smaller than the ones which remained together with it in eq.([x ] ) ( and consequently in eq.([14 ] ) ) therefore the energy differences in a particular row are also smaller than in a particular column .",
    "the analysis of eqs.([14])-([atr - weak ] ) is in agrement with the remarks above , i.e. the change of @xmath159 in @xmath268 is connected with the small energy differences in a particular row whereas the change of @xmath108 in @xmath269 is connected with the big energy differences in a particular column of the table  [ table ] .",
    "as we noticed in section  [ weak interaction limit ] the term with @xmath159 has been left for the sake of the angular momentum considerations .",
    "till now there does not exist established experimental evidence for multi - dimensionality of the world and/or our understanding of potential manifestations of higher dimensions is too poor . yet at the same time there exist in the literature multiple references indicating that the pursued effects of extra dimensions could have already been noticed earlier , both in the astrophysical @xcite , @xcite and in elementary particle scale @xcite , @xcite , contrary to the standard expectations that extremely high energies are necessary to probe higher dimensions .",
    "the renewed interest in the kaluza - klein theories , to which the presented six - dimensional model belongs , stems from the fact that multidimensional analogues of general relativity are able , among others , to generate the four dimensional mass out of the interaction which proceeds both from the four - dimensional world and from the internal space dimensions ( here two ) with currents of the matter which modify masses in the four - dimensional world ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our approach to the modelling of a system , e.g. of one particle ( here neutron ) , stems from the hope that its structure might be described by the dynamics in the six - dimensional space - time , and especially that its spin and , at least partly its inertia have their origin in the internal two - dimensional space .",
    "this is the reason for perceiving six - dimensional ( and more generally , multi - dimensional , the space - time would be eight - dimensional . ] ) theories as still attractive for understanding both fundamental interactions and the more sophisticated considerations which are related to the problem of mach s principle .    to fulfil this aim",
    "the present paper examines the implementation of the geometrical properties of the previously @xcite worked out six - dimensional kaluza - klein type model which manifest themselves in possible observational consequences in the realm of one particle physics , e.g. having an impact on the structure of neutron and its excited states .",
    "the obtained ground state solution , here neutron , appeared to have two spinorial degrees of freedom as the total angular momentum with @xmath251 goes ( for the main internal angular quantum number @xmath248 ) with two internal magnetic quantum number possibilities , @xmath154 or @xmath155 . in section  1.1 , the statistical fisherian reasons for the six - dimensionality of the space - time are given .",
    "the fundamentals of the model are presented in section  [ geometry ] where the static spherically symmetric `` reference '' back - ground solution of the six - dimensional einstein equations coupled with the klein - gordon equation with the dilatonic field as the basic one and the gravitational field as the self - field , is recalled @xcite . a more detailed discussion of its properties is presented in @xcite .",
    "the metric tensor part of the `` reference '' solution is , in a sense , analogous to the familiar four - dimensional schwarzschild solution but yet fundamentally different since it is horizon free . in section  [ stability ] the stability of the `` reference '' self - consistent solution",
    "section  [ implication ] is devoted to the derivation of the weak limit approximation of the general wave mechanical ( quantum mechanical ) approach which is defined in the context of losing ( here gravitational ) self - consistency .",
    "so , a new scalar field has been added to the original `` reference '' configuration of fields and the non self - consistent case for its klein - gordon equation is defined . here",
    "the main purpose is to find the solution of this klein - gordon equation and the reason for doing this is twofold . on one hand",
    "it is connected with the derivation of the energy of states . on the other hand with the indication of the spin origin of the configuration as the manifestation of both the geometry of the internal two - dimensional space and the kinematics of the fields inside it . in section",
    "[ global ] the problem of the departure from the ( gravitational ) self - consistent calculations of the metric and other fields of the configuration has been discussed .",
    "the lost of the self - consistency is connected with neglecting the perturbation term ( of the total energy - momentum tensor ) which is proportional to @xmath136 . in section  [ numerical example ]",
    "the implementation of the model to the description of neutron and its excited states has been performed , including the derivation of their energy .",
    "finally , the discussion of the consequences of zeroing of the first derivative term in the radial klein - gordon equation has been given in section  [ excited ] .",
    "the question arises on the status of the presented model of the neutron . as discussed previously in sections  [ implication ] and",
    "[ numerical example ] it is interpreted as the wave mechanical departure from the fully ( i.e. including gravitation ) self - consistent field theory understood in accordance with the schrdinger s substantial interpretation of the wave function @xcite .",
    "the wave mechanical approach means that the self - consistency is lost .",
    "yet there is hope that a fully self - consistent model which incorporates all the necessary fields and interactions will result not only in the refinement of the proposed model of the neutron and its excited states but also in the construction of better models of all other elementary matter particles . yet",
    "this is the difficult task to perform @xcite .",
    "+ in today s physics mainly the wave mechanical ( weak approximation case ) and quantum field theory ( linear ) regimes are perceived . yet",
    "self - consistent exceptions are also quoted , developed only for the description of the ( mainly linear ) fluctuations of the matter wave function @xcite .",
    "the concept which lies behind this approach is not the quantum theory of interactions with quantum gravity included @xcite with the second quantization procedure for a set of aggregated quanta .",
    "but , it is rather of a relativistic self - consistent field theory origin which includes all interactions , with gravity in this number .",
    "the consistency of this approach is guaranteed on the theoretical basis which is stronger than the mean - field theory concept as both wave mechanics and classical field theories can be understood as having the same , fisher - information origin with finite @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "+ finally , according to the calculation of this paper , mach s principle has to be modified .",
    "since the mass of a particle comes both from external and internal dimensions ( where the internal part of this mass is purely of the kinetic origin ) hence it is essential that the final mass of the particle should be calculated in the self - consistent formalism .",
    "it might be done in accord with a broadened version of thrirring and einstein analysis of einstein geometrodynamics or in accord with an effective gravity theory of the logunov type @xcite . in both cases",
    "the internal contribution to the mass should appear as the result of the self - consistent calculations .",
    "interestingly the same conclusions were drowned by frieden @xcite from the statistical method of estimating the physical models and just recently proved in @xcite , where the entanglement between the kinematical and structural degrees of freedom has been rigorously established .",
    "now , because the mass has its origin in the dynamics and the kinetic motion of the ( extended ) field of every elementary particle inside the internal space , we obtain an elementary property according to which every particle is a continuously extended object .",
    "+ yet , the presented model is obviously not the final one .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "at first , from its beginning it was formulated for the neutral particle only . the inclusion of e.g. the electric or effective weak charges , which would be necessary , changes the results . at second , the first particle in every chosen ladder of states should really be the ground state of the configuration of all fields which are taken into account to describe self - consistently both the ground state and excited states .",
    "hence , further calculations should incorporate more realistic shapes of both the main charge densities and their fluctuations for the extended basic matter sources to which proper self - fields are coupled .",
    "these shapes should follow both from the einstein equations coupled to e.g. klein - gordon - maxwell ( effective yang - mills ) or dirac - maxwell ( effective yang - mills ) set of equations for charge densities and fluctuations simultaneously , as it is required for the self - consistent models @xcite .",
    "it means that from the mathematical point of view , a matter particle seems to be a self - consistent solution of field equations for the basic fields ( including fluctuations ) and their self - fields which are involved in the description of this particle . the presented model indicates the place where the weak , wave mechanical limit of the theory lies and is a step towards the construction of the self - consistent formalism of the classical theory of one , continuously extended , elementary particle .",
