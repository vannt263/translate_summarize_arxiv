    "quasiparticles of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquids in the regime of the fraction quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) have the unusual properties of fractional charge @xcite and fractional exchange statistics @xcite .",

    "such a control made possible the first direct observation of the fractional quasiparticle charge in tunneling through an antidot @xcite .",
    "this observation was later extended to the regime of ballistic quasiparticle transport @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of quasiparticle localization on antidots relies on the combined action of the electric and magnetic field and is microscopically quite different from the corresponding features of electron localization in quantum dots . nevertheless , transport phenomena in antidots are very similar to those associated with the coulomb blockade in tunneling of individual electrons @xcite . for instance , in close analogy to the coulomb - blockade oscillations of conductance of the quantum dots @xcite , the antidots exhibit periodic conductance oscillations with each period corresponding to addition of one quasiparticle to the antidot @xcite .",
    "so far , antidot transport has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite for one antidot . in this work ,",
    "we develop a theory of correlated transport of individual quasiparticles through two antidots .",
    "the double - antidot system was discussed previously @xcite as a qubit , information in which is encoded by individual quasiparticles .",
    "such qubit is similar to superconducting charge qubits @xcite which are based on the dynamics of individual cooper pairs . as in the case of cooper",
    "pairs @xcite , the transport measurements on the quasiparticle qubit can be done more easily that direct measurements of the qubit dynamics .",
    "transport measurements would constitute the first step towards experimental development of the fqhe qubits .",
    "more generally , understanding the transport properties of multi - antidot systems , in particular the role of coulomb interaction for localization of individual quasiparticles , and significance of the edge - state decoherence , should also be important for other , more complicated types of suggested fqhe qubits @xcite which also require control over individual quasiparticles .",
    "the system we consider consists of two antidots in series between the two opposite edges of a primary quantum hall liquid with the filling factor @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "the antidots are tunnel - coupled to each other and to the edges , which play the role of quasiparticle reservoirs .",
    "the quasiparticle current through the antidots is driven by the transport voltage @xmath2 applied between the edges .",
    "the focus of this work is on the regime when all relevant energies are smaller than the energy gap @xmath3 of the antidots ( see below ) , and the transport can be described completely in terms of the transfer of individual quasiparticles .",
    "this regime is relevant , e.g. , for the operation of this system as a qubit .",
    "the main elements of the model of the double - antidot system in this case can be outlined as follows .",
    "an antidot formed at a point @xmath4 in a primary quantum hall liquid with the filling factor @xmath0 can be described as a collection of @xmath5 quasihole excitations created at this point .",
    "microscopically , the unnormalized wavefunction of this configuration is @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the laughlin s wavefunction of the unperturbed quantum hall liquid and , in the standard notations , the antidot position @xmath4 in the two - dimensional plane and the electron coordinates @xmath8 are given in the complex form and normalized to the characteristic length @xmath9 in the magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the number @xmath5 of the quasiholes is related to the geometric radius @xmath11 of the antidot : @xmath12 .    in what follows ,",
    "we make use only of the general qualitative features of the wavefunction ( [ e1 ] ) . for instance , in agreement with the typical experimental situation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we assume that the antidot is relatively large : @xmath13 .",
    "this means that addition / removal of individual quasiparticles ( here and below , this term will be used to describe processes with varying @xmath5 : @xmath14 ) , does not change the antidot parameters noticeably .",
    "indeed , the variation of the antidot radius in this case is @xmath15 and is small not only on the scale of @xmath11 , but , more importantly , on the scale of the magnetic length @xmath16 .",
    "the general form of the antidot energy @xmath17 as a function of @xmath5 is determined by the interplay of coulomb interaction and an external potential used to create the antidot . however , for large @xmath5 , and in some small range of variation of @xmath5 around the minimum of @xmath17 , one can always approximate this dependence as quadratic .",
    "this defines the characteristic energy gap @xmath18 which gives the energy interval of variation of the chemical potential @xmath19 of the system between the successive additions of individual quasiparticles to the antidot . for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ f1]a , the antidots exchange quasiparticles with the edges , and @xmath19 is defined by the edge chemical potential .",
    "in the situation of the antidot , when all the energies are dominated by the coulomb repulsion , the energy gap @xmath3 for changing the number of quasiparticles is approximately related to the energy gap for the antidot excitations at fixed @xmath5 : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the velocity of the excitations encircling the antidot . in general , e.g. in the case of quantum dots , the two types of energy gaps can be very different .",
    "we assume that the gap @xmath3 is sufficiently large for both antidots of the double - antidot system , so that in the reasonably large range of variation of @xmath19 both antidots are characterized by some well - defined numbers @xmath22 , @xmath23 , of the quasiparticles . in this regime",

    "the resulting four double - antidot states are relevant for the quasiparticle transport .",

    "these results can be generalized to non - identical antidots by taking a `` cross - section '' in the space of @xmath28 and @xmath29 along the direction appropriate for a given degree of the antidot asymmetry .    if the two antidots are sufficiently close , so that the distance between their edges is on the order of magnetic length @xmath16 , the quasiparticle states localized around them overlap and hybridize .",
    "this effect can be accounted for by the tunnel coupling @xmath32 of the antidots .",

    ", we assume that all contributions to this energy and the temperature @xmath38 are small : @xmath39 in this regime , tunneling through the antidots can be discussed in terms of correlated transfer of individual quasiparticles .",
    "since the gap @xmath3 is dominated by the coulomb interaction , i.e. has the same origin as the quasiparticle interaction energy @xmath1 , the most restrictive part of the assumption ( [ e4 ] ) is the condition on @xmath1 .",
    "this condition can still be satisfied , due to the difference between stronger quasiparticle repulsion on the same site and weaker repulsion on different sites .",
    "similarly to the tunnel coupling between the antidots , if the edges of the fqhe liquid are not far from the antidots on the scale of the magnetic length @xmath16 , there is a non - vanishing amplitude for quasiparticle tunneling between the edge and the nearest antidot .",

    ", the general quasiparticle operators ( [ e6 ] ) reduce to just the statistical klein factors up to a normalization constant . indeed , as one can see directly from eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) by bringing the @xmath56-part of ( [ e6 ] ) into the normal form , @xmath57 including this normalization constant in the tunnel amplitude @xmath58 , we see that the operators @xmath59 for quasiparticles at the antidots consist solely of the klein factors .",
    "the appropriate set of properties of the quasiparticle klein factors @xmath60 depends on the specific geometry of each edge - state tunneling problem .",
    "non - trivial examples of this can be found in @xcite .",
    "as follows from the discussion in the preceding section , in tunneling between the quantum antidots , the operators @xmath59 should account for the `` hardcore '' property of the quasiparticles : in the given range of external parameters only one extra quasiparticle can occupy one antidot . in general , these operators should also describe the anyonic exchange statistics of the fqhe quasiparticles , but the geometry of the double - antidot system ( fig .",
    "[ f1]a ) does not permit quasiparticle exchanges , and the exchange statistics of the tunneling particles is irrelevant .",
    "since the hardcore property makes the quasiparticle occupation factors equivalent to those of the fermions , and the actual exchange statistics is irrelevant , the antidot quasiparticle operators @xmath61 can be treated as fermions .",

    "in contrast to all other possible mechanisms of decoherence ( e.g. , plasmons in metallic gates , or charged impurities in the substrate ) the edges play the role of reservoirs in transport measurements and as a matter of principle can not be removed from the antidots . in this section",

    "the spectrum of the gapless edge excitations of one edge consists of magneto - plasmon oscillations ( [ e7 ] ) with the hamiltonian : @xmath62 we assume that the antidot system is symmetric , and a quasiparticle sitting on the first antidot creates a potential @xmath63 along the @xmath40th edge . the quasiparticle dynamics governed by the hamiltonian ( [ e3 ] ) is coupled then to the fluctuations of electron densities @xmath64 at the edges through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the change of the potential along the edges due to quasiparticle transfer between the antidots .",
    "since the edge - antidot distance and the distance between the antidots are on the order of antidot radius @xmath11 , this radius sets the range of the potential @xmath67 .",
