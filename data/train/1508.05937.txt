    "this space can be divided into regions on which the voronoi cell topology is constant .",
    "the topology of a point that lies on the boundaries of multiple regions is unstable , and infinitesimal perturbations of the neighbors will result in a change of topology .",

    "each choice of order parameter results in a different subdivision of @xmath5 into regions on which that order parameter is constant ; for real - valued continuous functions , these regions are commonly known as level sets . to help understand the degeneracy observed in continuous order - parameter methods ,",
    "consider that for every continuous mapping @xmath11 from an unbounded high - dimensional space to a lower - dimensional space , there exist points @xmath12 arbitrarily far apart , but for which @xmath13 and @xmath14 are identical @xcite .",
    "the continuity of an order parameter thus entails the kind of degeneracy highlighted above .",
    "in contrast , discrete order parameters are not subject to this limitation , as distances between points with identical order - parameter values can be bounded .",
    "this motivates the question of how to reasonably subdivide @xmath5 .",
    "we now show that voronoi topology offers one such approach .      for a fixed set of particles ,",
    "the voronoi cell of a central particle is the region of real space closer to that particle than to any other @xcite .",
    "figure [ example_cell ] illustrates a central particle , its voronoi cell , and fifteen neighboring particles .",
    "two particles whose voronoi cells share a face are called neighbors .",
    "we identify two voronoi cells as having the same topology , or * topological type * , if there exists a one - to - one correspondence between their sets of faces that preserves adjacency .",
    "the topology of the voronoi cell of a particle describes the manner in which neighbors of a particle are arranged relative to it .",
    "an @xmath0-sided face , for example , indicates a pair of particles which have @xmath0 neighbors in common .",
    "the topology of a voronoi cell thus provides a robust description of how neighbors are arranged not only relative to a central particle , but also to one another . in this sense",
    ", it is a good description of local structure .",
    "voronoi cell topology also provides a natural decomposition of @xmath5 into regions in which the voronoi cell topology is constant , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mapping](d ) .",
    "we consider this decomposition natural because it allows us to coarse - grain the effects of small perturbations on local structure .",
    "small perturbations of the particle coordinates correspond to small displacements in @xmath5 , and since the voronoi topology does not change for almost all points under small perturbations , these small perturbations , which are often unimportant , are naturally ignored without the introduction of an artificial cut - off @xcite .",
    "voronoi cell topology was first introduced by bernal and others to study the atomic structure of liquids @xcite , and has been subsequently applied to study a wide range of condensed matter systems , including random sphere packings @xcite , finite - temperature crystals @xcite , and metallic glasses @xcite . in those studies",
    ", however , the topology of a cell was characterized by counting its types of faces ( e.g. , triangles and quadrilaterals ) , though it ignored the way in which those faces are arranged .",
    "while this limited description has been used to study some aspects of crystallization @xcite , it can not distinguish particles whose local environments are fcc from those whose local environments are hcp , as both voronoi cells have twelve four - sided faces .",
    "in previous work @xcite , the authors have shown how to use a graph - tracing algorithm introduced by weinberg @xcite to efficiently compute strings which encode a complete description of the voronoi cell topology ; see methods for further details .    a second limitation arising in traditional voronoi approaches results from abrupt changes in topology due to small geometric perturbations .",
    "consider , for example , that voronoi cells of particles in fcc and hcp crystals are topologically unstable  since some vertices are shared by more than four voronoi cells ( see fig .",
    "[ mapping ] ) , infinitesimal perturbations of the particle positions , such as those arising from non - hydrostatic strain or thermal vibrations , will change their topology @xcite .",
    "this problem has been sufficiently challenging to limit the utility of conventional voronoi approaches in studying even slightly perturbed crystal structures @xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved through the classification of topological types described in the following section .      in this section",
    "we show how topological types can be classified using the approach developed in the previous two sections . on a basic level ,",
    "every arrangement of neighbors relative to a central particle can be described by its voronoi cell topology .",
    "families of topological types associated with a particular structure can then be defined as sets of types obtained through infinitesimal perturbations of that structure .",
    "this classification scheme enables a description of the effects of small strains and thermal vibrations on local structure , and provides a robust framework suitable for theoretical and numerical analysis .    every local arrangement of neighbors @xmath15",

    "a suitable distance function on @xmath5 allows us to define sets of topological types associated with infinitesimal perturbations as follows .",
    "we let @xmath21 be a ball of radius @xmath22 centered at @xmath4 .",
    "this region of @xmath5 corresponds to configurations obtained through small perturbations of a particle and its neighbors , where @xmath22 controls the magnitude of such a perturbation .",

    "the voronoi cell topology of points in the interior of a region in @xmath5 remains unchanged by small perturbations .",
    "in contrast , points such as @xmath8 and @xmath26 are located at the boundaries of multiple regions , and small perturbations entail a change in voronoi cell topology .",
    "thus , @xmath27 and @xmath28 consist of multiple topological types , whereas @xmath29 , located in the interior of a region , consists of a single type .",
    "if a topological type is in @xmath25 , then we say that it is a @xmath15-type .",
    "note that a topological type can belong to multiple families ; this indeterminacy will be considered below .",
    "this classification of @xmath15-types allows us to account for topological instability without modifying the sample data by collapsing edges or faces using _ ad hoc _ criteria ( e.g. , cut - offs ) @xcite .    among @xmath15-types ,",

    "in contrast , fractional volumes tend to zero as @xmath36 for other regions which meet @xmath8 at cusps ; these are secondary fcc - types .",
    "the distinction between primary and secondary types appears to result from the manner in which topological instabilities resolve when perturbed . to illustrate this distinction , fig .",

    ", a new four - sided face is formed between two non - adjacent voronoi cells ; all unstable vertices resolve in this manner in primary types .",
    "a less common resolution can also occur as a result of cooperative motion of neighboring particles . in this resolution , depicted in fig .",
    "[ transition](c ) , two triangular faces are created @xcite ; secondary types can include such resolutions .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "a small perturbation will cause the vertex to resolve into either ( b ) a four - sided face , or ( c ) a pair of adjacent triangular faces ; these resolutions are associated with primary and secondary types , respectively.[transition ] ]    determining @xmath25 is feasible through consideration of all possible ways in which unstable vertices can resolve .",
    "for example , the ideal fcc voronoi cell , illustrated in fig .  [ mapping](b ) , has six unstable vertices . in primary types ,",
    "each such vertex resolves in a manner illustrated in fig .",
    "[ transition](b ) , in one of three directions .",
    "more specifically , the unstable vertex can transform in such a way that the central cell gains a square face , or else gains an edge in one of two directions .",
    "we consider all possible combinations of these resolutions over the six unstable vertices , and calculate the topological types of the resulting polyhedra using the algorithm developed in @xcite ; a total of 44 distinct topological types occur in this manner . in secondary types , unstable vertices",
    "can also resolve in the manner illustrated in fig .",
    "[ transition](c ) , or else remain unstable .",
    "an additional 6250 topological types can occur in this manner .",
    "a similar approach can be followed to determine @xmath25 for other structures .",
    "additional details can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "the proposed distinction between primary and secondary types is supported by atomistic simulation .",
    "we studied the atomic structure of three model materials , bcc tungsten @xcite , fcc copper @xcite , and hcp magnesium @xcite , at elevated temperatures using molecular dynamics ( md ) in the @xmath37 ensemble @xcite .",
    "simulated systems contained 1,024,000 , 1,372,000 , and 1,029,600 atoms , respectively , in periodic supercells . in each simulation ,",
    "a defect - free crystal was heated from @xmath38 in increments of 50 k and equilibrated for 50 ps at each temperature .",
    "figure [ all_types ] shows how the distribution of topological types changes with temperature ; each curve indicates the frequency of a single topological type .",
    "types can be grouped according to the shape of their frequency curves .",
    "frequencies of one group of types approach finite values as @xmath39 , and change very little with temperature ( blue curves in fig .  [ all_types ] ) .",
    "frequencies of a second group rapidly approach zero as @xmath39 ( pink curves ) .",
    "types of a third group only appear at high temperatures ( grey curves ) . remarkably , these groups correspond exactly to the sets of primary @xmath15 , secondary @xmath15 , and non-@xmath15-types for each system , as enumerated using the analysis of instabilities , described above .",
    "the theory of @xmath15-types is thus consistent with observed results and suggests a new approach for analyzing thermal effects .    one noteworthy feature of fig .",
    "[ all_types ] is the similarity between fcc and hcp , in contrast to bcc .",
    "these general behaviors appear to depend primarily on the crystal structure rather than on bonding particulars .",
    "indeed , preliminary investigations show that when atoms in bcc , fcc , and hcp crystals are perturbed from their equilibrium positions with a gaussian noise whose magnitude scales with temperature ( i.e. , an einstein model @xcite ) , the distribution of topological types changes in a manner similar to that observed in fig .",
    "[ all_types ] .",
    "a second notable feature is the total frequency of @xmath15-types in the liquid phases of the three systems . in liquid tungsten , the unique bcc - type accounts for less than @xmath40 of all atoms just above @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is the bulk melting temperature .",
    "in contrast , liquid copper consists of roughly 20% fcc - types , and liquid magnesium consists of roughly 30% hcp - types , just above @xmath41 .",
    "these structural data are relevant in studying physical processes such as crystallization @xcite and melting @xcite .",
    "a third feature that stands out is the high fraction of @xmath15-types in the fcc and hcp samples at temperatures just below melting . in fcc , 94% of all atoms",
    "are classified as having fcc local structure just below melting ; in hcp this number is 96% . at 0.85@xmath41 ,",
    "these numbers are over 99% in both systems .",
    "this suggests a natural use of @xmath15-types for identifying structure in highly - perturbed atomistic systems , such as those at high temperatures .",
    "we next consider several applications of the proposed approach to illustrate some of its unique features .",
    "as noted , the high frequencies of @xmath15-types in single crystals , even at extremely high temperatures , suggests their use for visualization of local structure in atomic systems .",
    "figure [ polycrystal ] shows thin cross - sections from an fcc aluminum polycrystal prepared using md @xcite .",
    "the sample was obtained by annealing a microstructure obtained through simulated grain - growth @xcite , plastically deforming it at low temperature , and then thermalizing it at @xmath42 . in these figures , atoms that are fcc - types",
    "are not shown for clarity ; among the remaining atoms , those that are hcp - types are shown in gold , and all other atoms are shown in dark blue ."
