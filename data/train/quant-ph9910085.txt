    "optical homodyne tomography is a well - established quantitative method for measuring the quantum state of radiation and for obtaining the expectation value of arbitrary observables of the field @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "the success of optical homodyne tomography has stimulated research relating to the state - reconstruction procedures in other fields , such as in the realm of atomic @xcite , molecular @xcite , and ion - trap @xcite physics . as a matter of fact , the tomographic method is a kind of universal detection technique @xcite , with which one can measure any observable @xmath0 of the field by averaging a suitable unbiased estimator @xmath1(x,\\phi ) $ ] over the homodyne data @xmath2 at random phase values @xmath3 .",
    "single - mode homodyne tomography can be immediately generalized to multimode fields . for factorized multimode operators @xmath4",
    "the corresponding estimator is just the product of the estimators for each of the single - mode operators @xmath5 . by linearity",
    "the estimator can then be extended to generic multimode operators .",
    "however , such a simple generalization requires a separate homodyne measurement for each of the modes , which can not be achieved in practice when the modes of the field are not spatio - temporally separated . for this reason ,",
    "tomographic methods have been devised which either use only a single local oscillator ( lo ) @xcite , or avoid the use of conventional homodyne detection @xcite . however , both the methods work for only two modes of the field , and the self - homodyne method of ref .",
    "@xcite is suitable only in special experimental situations ( e.g. , in the tomography of parametrically downconverted radiation ) .",
    "therefore , a more general multimode tomographic method is needed , especially in consideration of the possibility of a precise analysis for pulsed fields , for which the problem of mode matching between the lo and the detected fields ( determined by their relative spatio - temporal overlap ) @xcite gives a detrimental contribution to the overall quantum efficiency .",
    "in this paper we propose a general method for measuring an arbitrary observable of the multimode electromagnetic field , which uses homodyne detection with a _",
    "single _ lo .",
    "we provide the rule for evaluating the `` unbiased estimator '' of a generic multimode operator .",
    "the quantum expectation value of the operator can then be obtained for any unknown state of the radiation field through an average of this estimator over the homodyne outcomes that are collected using a single lo which scans over different linear combinations of the incident modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the general method for obtaining the estimator pertaining to an arbitrary multimode operator . upon averaging this estimator over the homodyne outcomes , one obtains the quantum expectation value of the corresponding operator .",
    "we specialize to observables corresponding to the matrix elements of the multimode density operator and to the total number of photons . in the two - mode case",
    "we explicitly derive the estimator for the four - dimensional q - function and for the moments generating function of the total number of photons . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the experimental conditions for extracting the joint photon - number probability and the distribution of the total number of photons for two - mode quantum states .",
