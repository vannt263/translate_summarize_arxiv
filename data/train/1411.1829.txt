    "free space optical ( fso ) communications provide larger bandwidth with higher security and higher flexibility compared with conventional wireless communications . due to the complexity of phase and frequency modulation , intensity modulation with direct detection ( im / dd )",
    "is used for most current fso communication systems . to increase the system spectral efficiency ,",
    "higher order modulation , such as @xmath0-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( @xmath0-pam ) , is preferred .",
    "compared to fso on - off keying ( ook ) systems , which can be considered as binary - pam systems , the @xmath0-pam ( @xmath1 ) system suffers more severely from signal intensity fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors . to recover the information reliably , accurate channel state information(csi ) , i.e. , the instantaneous channel gain , is required .",
    "one way to acquire the csi is to use pilot symbols , which results in a reduction of system spectral efficiency and thus is not so desirable .",
    "the receiver design problem is still challenged by the fact that the csi is hard to acquire at the receiver side if no pilot symbols are used .",
    "based on the generalised likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) principle , a maximum likelihood ( ml ) sequence detection ( mlsd ) receiver ( the glrt - mlsd receiver ) is derived for ook systems in @xcite . in this paper , based on the same glrt principle , we extend the glrt - mlsd receiver to higher order pam systems .",
    "this new glrt - mlsd receiver requires very few pilot symbols for initialising .",
    "after that , it can continuously estimate the instantaneous channel gain and adapt its decision metric accordingly without further insertion of pilot symbols .",
    "since few pilot symbols are required and higher order pam is adopted , the system is spectrally efficient .    to efficiently implement the glrt - mlsd receiver , the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm and the selective - store strategy proposed in @xcite are adopted . by adopting the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm , the search complexity is reduced to a very low level that is independent of the observation window length . with the help of selective - store strategy ,",
    "we completely avoid potential decision ambiguities which can cause an error floor problem . by theoretical analysis and simulation ,",
    "we have shown that as the observation window length increases , the bit error probability ( bep ) of our receiver approaches the genie bound , which is defined as the bep of ml detection with perfect csi ( pcsi ) .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly present the channel model .",
    "section iii introduces the ideal ml detection with pcsi and the genie bound .",
    "our glrt - mlsd receiver for high - level pam systems is derived in section iv .",
    "the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm as well as the selective - store strategy is given in section v ; also , we analyze the performance of our receiver with this implementation method .",

    "the received electrical signal at time point @xmath7 is modelled as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the minimum signal distance when no fading exists and is expressed in terms of the electrical - domain energy per bit @xmath10 and the modulation order @xmath0 by @xmath11 in , @xmath12 is the instantaneous channel gain , @xmath13 is the transmitted symbol which takes on any value from set @xmath14 with equal probability , and @xmath15 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with mean zero and power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17=\\frac{n_0}{2 } \\delta _ { ij}$ ] .    as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , geometric spread and pointing errors @xmath18 , atmospheric turbulence @xmath19 , and path loss @xmath20 together",

    "the channel state @xmath12 can be formulated as @xmath21 , where @xmath20 is deterministic while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are stochastic .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , @xmath20 can be incorporated into @xmath19 which amounts to setting @xmath22 , resulting to @xmath23 . for the weak turbulence channel ,",
    "@xmath19 is a log - normal distributed random variable with its probability density function ( pdf ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the variance of log - amplitude fluctuation . for the strong turbulence channel , @xmath19",
    "is modelled by the gamma - gamma distribution with its pdf : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the variances of the small and large scale eddies , respectively .",
    "the pdf of @xmath18 is expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fraction of the collected power when no pointing error occurs , and @xmath32 is the ratio between the equivalent beam radius at the receiver and the pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver .",
    "finally , the pdf of @xmath21 can be derived by @xmath33 further details of this channel model , especially - , can be found in @xcite .",
    "scintillation index ( si ) is defined as the normalised variance of the irradiance fluctuations @xcite . according to our model @xmath21 ,",
    "si is given by @xmath34 , but not @xmath35 .",
    "since the time scales of these fading processes are of the order of @xmath36s to @xmath37s , which is far larger than the bit interval ( @xmath38s for multi - gbps systems ) , @xmath12 is considered to be constant over a large number @xmath39 of transmitted data symbols @xcite . it is obvious that the channel coherence length @xmath39 could be assumed at least of the order of @xmath40 symbol intervals .    the received electrical instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per bit is defined as @xmath41 @xcite . the _ average snr _ over all possible channel states is thus @xmath42 .",
    "specifically , if pilot symbols are required , for example , there are @xmath43 pilot symbols and @xmath44 data symbols in every data packet , the _ effective average snr _ is @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath43 is very small compared to @xmath44 , i.e. , the ratio @xmath46 is far smaller than 1 , the value of @xmath47 tends to be equal to the value of @xmath48 .    in this paper ,",
    "when it comes to pilot symbols , we specifically refer to the pilot symbols that are used for instantaneous csi acquisition .",
    "thus , @xmath43 is the number of pilot symbols that are used for csi acquisition in each packet . in practice ,",
    "pilot symbols are also required for some other purposes such as timing synchronization .",
    "the pcsi receiver knows the csi perfectly and performs ml detection by setting the decision @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51is the pdf of @xmath52 conditioned on @xmath12 , @xmath53 and @xmath13 .",
    "based on , we know this conditional pdf is @xmath54 substituting into and eliminating irrelevant items , we simplify the decision rule to @xmath55 after performing , a reverse gary mapping is required to recover the information bits .    at this point , we see that besides the csi , i.e. the instantaneous value of @xmath12 , the value of @xmath53 ( or the value of @xmath10 ) is also essential to perform ml detection . more intuitively , we give the constellation at the receiver side in fig .",
    "[ fg : constellation_rx ] , from which we can see the instantaneous values of both @xmath12 are @xmath53 are required .",
    "we first consider the awgn channel , in which the value of @xmath12 is always 1 .",
    "the symbol error probability ( sep ) of pam signals over the awgn channel is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 4.3 - 4 ) ) @xmath56 where the @xmath57-function @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 thus , the sep of the pcsi receiver given in conditioned on a fixed value of @xmath12 is @xmath60 and the average sep over all possible values of @xmath12 is @xmath61    if only adjacent symbol errors are considered , the bep of pam signals can be approximated in a simple form , which is @xmath62 for the fso channel @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "this ideal receiver and its performance are used as a benchmark when analysing other receivers .",
    "the average bep of this pcsi receiver is also referred to as the _ genie bound_. as csi is known at the receiver side , no pilot symbols are required , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "apart from this subsection , in all the other parts of this paper , when it comes to the bep , we refer to the average bep over all possible channel states .",
    "we consider a subsequence with @xmath4 immediate past symbols of the entire sequence , where @xmath4 is much smaller than the channel coherence length @xmath39 . at time @xmath7 , the transmitted data subsequence is denoted by @xmath64 $ ] where @xmath65 for any integer @xmath66 .",

    "we use @xmath75 and @xmath76 to denote the detection result on subsequence @xmath6 and the estimated value of @xmath12 , respectively . from , the decision rule is reduced to @xmath77 for a given @xmath6 , by differentiating @xmath78 with respect to @xmath12 and letting the derivative be equal to zero , we find that @xmath78 achieves its minimum value at @xmath79 here , it should be emphasized that @xmath80 is the ml estimate of @xmath12 conditioned on a hypothesised data subsequence @xmath6 . substituting into @xmath78 ,",
    "we get @xmath81 the right hand side of gives the minimum value of @xmath78 for each subsequence @xmath6 .",
    "thus , to minimize @xmath78 , we only need to maximize @xmath82 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "the decision rule now is reduced to @xmath83 after , a reverse gray mapping , which is from symbols to bits , is required to recover the transmitted data information in bits .    here",
    ", we can see that the decision metric of our glrt - mlsd receiver given in is exactly the same as the one given in ( * ? ? ? * eq . ( 39 ) ) .",
    "thus , it retains all the benefits :    * only a simple evaluation of the decision metric value , where no integrals and no requirement of values of @xmath10 and @xmath84 are involved , is required * the estimation of @xmath12 in is implicit * that the channel model information is not required in makes it robust and enables it to operate in any slowly time - varying environment , regardless of the distribution of @xmath12",
    "in principle , to implement , one has to compare the metric values of @xmath85 possible subsequences and choose the one with highest metric value . clearly , the search complexity increases exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "thus , to use a large value of @xmath4 and to keep the implementation simple , a viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm , which has been first investigated in @xcite and further studied for fso ook systems in @xcite , is adopted .",
    "ook can be regarded as a special case of @xmath0-pam for @xmath86 . in (",
    "2 ) , the trellis for ook signals is given .",
    "here , we only give the trellis for 4-pam in fig .",
    "[ fg:4pam_trellis ] and trellises with other values of @xmath0 can be obtained accordingly . for generalised @xmath0-pam signals ,",
    "the search algorithms are similar and we provide an example for 4-pam systems as follows .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg:4pam_trellis ] , a trellis with 4 nodes at each time point @xmath7 is constructed .",
    "each node is labelled by the possible transmitted data symbol 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "all the branches , leading into the same node , represent transmission of the symbol corresponding to that node at time point @xmath7 .",
    "the metric of the path @xmath87 at time @xmath7 is computed based on with only the @xmath4 most recent data symbols and received signals .",
    "for each node at each time @xmath7 , four paths corresponding to four hypothesized subsequences enter it .",
    "the algorithm computes the metrics of the four hypothesized subsequences , then saves the one with the highest metric value , and discards others .",
    "the same is repeated for all paths entering the same node , and the path with the largest metric is saved as the survivor . the decision on a symbol",
    "is made only when the tails of all survivors have merged at a node .",
    "an additional reverse gray mapping needs to be performed to recover the information bits .",
    "we segment the subsequence into two parts : the _ detected part _ that is the subsequence before the most recent merge node , and the _ ongoing part _ that is the part after the most recent node .",
    "we use @xmath88 to denote the length of the detected part and @xmath89 the ongoing part .",
    "the detected part is also called the observation window , and thus @xmath88 is the observation window length . in practice , to choose an appropriate memory size , three aspects need to be considered .",
    "one is to retain complete survivors after the most recent merge node .",
    "obviously , @xmath89 is a random number . from simulation observations ,",
    "the mean of @xmath89 is no larger than 3 .",
    "we can safely set @xmath90 to reserve some memory for possible long survivors .",
    "another aspect is to choose a large @xmath88 to keep the probability that all the data symbols in the observation window are zeros as small as possible .",
    "if only zeros exist in the observation window , we will have a zero denominator of the decision metric and a consequent decision ambiguity .",
    "the last aspect is to make sure @xmath91 .",
    "we just argued that it is possible to encounter a large number of successive zeros in the data stream filling the whole observation window , which would lead to a zero denominator and cause a consequent error floor problem . increasing the value of @xmath88 can only reduce the probability of incurring a zero denominator but can not avoid it completely .",
    "similar to that introduced in @xcite , when storing the detected subsequence and the corresponding received signal subsequence element by element , we can discard element @xmath92 and the corresponding element @xmath93 for any @xmath66 .",
    "the memory size for the detected signals , i.e. the observation window size @xmath88 , does not change , while we completely avoid the potential troublesome zero denominator .",
    "since the decision metric of a path ( corresponding to a subsequence ) given in is not the sum of all branch metrics , the optimality of the detector output can not be guaranteed . in this section",
    ", we prove that the bep of this suboptimal detection method can approach the genie bound as the observation window length increases .",
    "we suppose that the actual transmitted data subsequence at time @xmath94 is @xmath95 $ ] , and @xmath96 $ ] is an alternative subsequence , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 can take any value from set @xmath99 with equal probability .",
    "subsequence @xmath100 differs from @xmath101 only at time @xmath7 ; i.e. , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we further assume that exact @xmath88 non - zero data symbols exist in subsequence @xmath105 .",

    "<S> compared to on - off keying ( ook ) , @xmath0-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( @xmath0-pam , @xmath1 ) is more spectrally efficient . however , to detect @xmath0-pam signals reliably , the requirement of accurate channel state information is more stringent . </S>",
    "<S> previously , for ook systems , we have developed a receiver that requires few pilot symbols and can jointly detect the data sequence and estimate the unknown channel gain implicitly . in this paper , using the same approach , we extend our previous work and derive a generalized receiver for @xmath0-pam systems . a viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm coupled with a selective - store strategy </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the receiver is efficient in terms of energy , spectra , implementation complexity and memory . using theoretical analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we show that its error performance approaches that of maximum likelihood detection with perfect knowledge of the channel gain , as the observation window length increases . also , simulation results are presented to justify the theoretical analysis .    </S>",
