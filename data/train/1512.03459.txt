    "the final stages of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars involve complex and poorly understood physical phenomena that lead to the formation of axially symmetric bipolar planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the origin of these spectacular structures is generally associated to interactions between the material expelled from the evolved star and an orbiting companion ( lagagec & chesneau @xcite ; soker & livio @xcite ) . the presence of a circumstellar disk is also invoked to collimate mass loss and foster the appearance of the axial symmetry , but such disks have only been observed in a few evolved stars .",

    "but its flux contribution is considerable in the visible ( @xmath25% of the primary ) , pointing at a stellar origin .",
    "regarding the polarization vector , the difficulty is that the secondary is located so close to the primary ( 32 mas ) , that its measurement is highly uncertain .",
    "we see a slight deviation from the classical single central source vector map ( purely orthoradial ) , but not at a sufficiently significant level . + 2 ) the degree of polarization @xmath15 has the advantage to be a simple proxy for the scattering angle @xmath26 ( in the single scattering approximation ) , and therefore well suited to probe the overall geometry of the disk .",
    "the polarized flux @xmath24 is sensitive to both the scattering angle @xmath26 and the scattering dust density @xmath27 , therefore relatively more complex to model . in l@xmath0 pup ,",
    "the @xmath24 map is generally similar to the total intensity map , except close to the primary star where the polarization is low ( forward scattering ) .",
