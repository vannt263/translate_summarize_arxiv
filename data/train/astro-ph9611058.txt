    "mass outflow is known to be a common and perhaps inevitable part of star formation , a process more axiomatically associated with mass infall .",
    "observations of young low - mass stars at optical , near - infrared , and millimeter wavelengths often reveal highly collimated bipolar jets and molecular outflows ( edwards , ray , & mundt 1993 ) , generally believed to be driven by magnetocentrifugal forces arising through an interaction between the magnetic field and wind associated with a rotating circumstellar disk ( knigl & ruden 1993 ) .",
    "the situation for high - mass stars is less clear : although winds are known to be a continuing force throughout the evolution of a massive star ( langer 1994 ) , their role is not well understood at the earliest phases , at least in part because massive stars are intrinsically rather rare and generally quite far from the sun , making it harder to study them in detail .",
    "nevertheless , bipolar outflows have been found from a few young massive stars including cepheus  a ( bally & lane 1991 ) , s106 ( staude & elssser 1993 ) , iras08159@xmath03543 ( neckel & staude 1995 ) , g25.65 + 1.05 and g240.31 + 0.07 ( shepherd & churchwell 1996 ) .",
    "compared to low - mass systems , their outflows tend to be more chaotic , spreading over a wider angle , and often appearing to have multiple jets . as",
    "yet however , the driving mechanisms for the outflows from young massive stars remain unclear .",
    "the nearest site of ongoing massive star formation is in the bn - kl complex embedded in the omc-1 molecular cloud behind the orion nebula ( genzel & stutzki 1989 ) .",
    "irc2 has long been thought to be the dominant source of luminosity in the complex , in part because it is the brightest compact source of mid- to far - infrared luminosity , and also because of its association with typical high - mass star formation tracers such as water masers ( wynn - williams 1984 ) .",
    "however , recent high spatial resolution infrared and radio observations have shown the situation to be considerably more complicated ( gezari 1992 ; dougados 1993 ; menten & reid 1995 ) . when viewed at sub - arcsec resolution ,",
    "the nominal point source irc2 is seen to break up into a small cluster of sources , none of which are directly associated with radio emission from ultracompact regions expected of young , massive stars .",
    "however , such an ultracompact region is found to lie directly south of the infrared sources , suggesting that perhaps the latter are all simply `` holes in the clouds '' illuminated by the true dominant luminosity source ( menten & reid 1995 ) , and that luminosity estimates based on their infrared emission are unreliable .",
    "furthermore , the nearby source `` n '' ( lonsdale 1982 ) shows both strong ir emission and radio emission from an ultracompact region with a hint of bipolar structure that lies within the error bars for the center of emission for the water masers , unlike irc2 ( menten & reid 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems apparent that the core of the bn - kl complex holds a small cluster of very young self - luminous sources , also including the bn and irc9 sources ( beck 1984 ) .",
    "what remains uncertain is which source , if any , dominates the total luminosity of the complex .",
    "what is certain , however , is that the bn - kl complex is associated with a spectacular outflow . embedded in omc-1 and obscured by @xmath1@xmath2",
    ", the outflow must be observed at infrared wavelengths or longer : the shocked molecular gas associated with the outflow is best seen in the near - infrared emission lines of h@xmath3 , notably the v=10 s(1 ) line at 2.122 ( beckwith 1978 ; taylor 1984 ) .",
    "the increased spatial resolution achieved by infrared imaging observations over the past decade has revealed a striking swath of bow - shocks and trailed wakes ( henceforth referred to collectively as `` fingers '' ) originating in the vicinity of irc2 ( lane 1989 ; allen & burton 1993 ; sugai 1994 , 1995 ; everett , depoy , & pogge 1995 ; schild , miller , & tennyson 1996 ) .",
    "the multiple fingers of shocked h@xmath3 cover a wide angle on the sky and therefore pose a problem for most models developed for outflows from low - mass stars , in which only a single jet is thought to be active .",
    "it is conceptually possible for a single precessing jet to create the multiple fingers , but as the cooling time for excited h@xmath3 is short ( on the order of one year ) , the precession speed required to produce multiple fingers would be extraordinary ; furthermore , curved jets would be expected ( schild 1996 ) . with these problems in mind ,",
    "allen & burton ( 1993 ) revived a long dormant model for herbig - haro objects , in which `` bullets '' of material are ejected from a central source , forming bow - shocks and shocked wakes behind them as they plow through ambient molecular gas .",
    "allen & burton suggested that a single explosive event in the bn - kl complex within the past few thousand years might have resulted in a veritable barrage of `` artillery shells ''",
    "( burton & allen 1994 ) , creating the swath of fingers seen today .",
    "however , the bullet model for h - h objects , bow - shocks , and wakes had fallen out of favor because of the difficulty associated with ejecting isolated clumps of molecular gas from a source in an explosive event and having them remain coherent over long paths through the surrounding molecular cloud . in the case of omc-1",
    ", there is also the problem that multiple bullets must be ejected almost simultaneously over a wide fan .",
    "stone , xu , & mundy ( 1995 ) recently proposed a new model for creating the bullets and swath of fingers seen in omc-1 .",
    "their model starts with a central , massive , young stellar object driving a strong spherical wind , sweeping up ambient gas into a thin , dense shell .",
    "as long as such a shell continues to decelerate , it will remain stable to rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "however , stone propose that the wind velocity may vary with time , and that if the velocity were to increase sharply , the shell would be accelerated into the surrounding dense medium , become subject to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , break into fragments , and form exactly the swath of bow - shocks and wakes that is observed .",
    "thus , their model achieves three important things : first , fragments are created ; second , a single event at the source  the increase in wind speed  naturally leads to multiple fragments over a wide area ; and third , these fragments are created at some finite radius from the source , thus allowing them to be observed quite some way from it before being destroyed .",
    "moreover , this model predicts that behind the fingers , the inner part of the shell should break up into a highly clumpy structure , a feature that would not be expected in a standard bullet model , and that had not been observed when stone made their proposal . in this paper , we present new images of the shocked h@xmath3 emission in omc-1 which confirm that just such a clumpy shell lies at the base of the fingers , therefore adding considerable weight to the proposal of stone",
    "all previous images of the h@xmath3 emission in omc-1 have been made in a direct imaging mode , placing a narrow - band filter in front of a single raster - scanning detector or an imaging array .",
    "the problem with this technique is subtraction of bright continuum emission in the same band - pass from the bn - kl complex and foreground orion nebula .",
    "observations at a nearby continuum wavelength are required , but by necessity must be taken before or after the h@xmath3 line observations .",
    "slight changes in the seeing and sky background emission are inevitable , making accurate removal of point and extended continuum sources difficult .",
    "we have taken another approach to the problem , namely long - slit spectroscopy , in which the line and continuum emission at a given point on the sky are measured strictly simultaneously .",
    "we used the magic 256@xmath4256 pixel near - ir camera ( herbst 1993 ) on the calar alto 2.2 m telescope on 20 november 1994 with a pixel size of 0.6 arcsec , and a slit size of 154@xmath41.2 arcsec .",
    "a direct - ruled znse grism was used to cover the whole band ( 2.02.4 ) at a resolution of 300 , including several lines of molecular hydrogen , ionized hydrogen and helium , as well as adjacent continuum . a data cube ( ra@xmath4dec@xmath4@xmath5 )",
    "was built up by stepping the slit over the region , one slit width at a time , with an integration time of 60 seconds per position .",
    "equivalent sky observations were made every 30 minutes several arcmin to the west .",
    "the total number of on - source slit positions was 120 , therefore covering a total area of @xmath22.5@xmath42.5 arcmin with an effective pixel size of 1.2@xmath40.6 arcsec .",
    "the region is shown in figure  1 ( plate  a ) overlaid on a narrow - band continuum ( no line emission from h@xmath3 ) image with a similar spatial resolution ( @xmath21.5 arcsec fhwm ) for comparison ; key objects are labeled for reference .",
    "the data reduction process is illustrated in figure  2 ( plate  b ) .",
    "figure  2a shows a single raw source frame : the vertical lines are from the extended nebular gas and oh airglow which dominates the sky background at these wavelengths ; the horizontal stripes are from compact continuum sources ( stars ) .",
    "figure  2b is a single sky frame , showing just the oh airglow lines .",
    "figure  2c is the result of subtracting a stack of sky frames from the source frame . in this image ,",
    "the vertical lines are slightly curved , the horizontal lines slightly tilted , and the wavelength dispersion non - linear , due to various instrumental effects . the curvature and dispersion were determined as a function of slit position and wavelength by fitting bright oh airglow lines in the sky frames , and the continuum tilt was measured from a number of bright stellar spectra .",
    "the data were then rectified to give a linear wavelength dispersion , with extended emission lines running down columns and discrete continuum sources across rows . each image",
    "was then divided by a tungsten - illuminated spectral dome flat .",
    "similar data processing was applied to spectra of a bright spectral standard star , which were then extrapolated to form a full spectral image .",
    "finally , each source image was divided by the standard star image , then multiplied by the appropriate black - body curve in order to remove the atmospheric transmission profile .",
    "figure  2d shows the final calibrated and rectified source data for one slit position .",
    "several molecular and ionized nebular emission lines are identified for reference , although only the v=10 s(1 ) h@xmath3 line is discussed further in this paper .",
    "the spectral images were stacked to form a cube with axes ra , dec , and wavelength , thus allowing us to extract ra@xmath4dec slices at any given wavelength .",
    "three slices straddling the h@xmath3 v=10 s(1 ) line at 2.122 were extracted and co - added , weighted by intensity ; an equivalent continuum was made by averaging five slices on either side of 2.122 .",
    "these two images were bilinearly interpolated up by a factor of 4@xmath42 , in order to give images with equal pixel size ( 0.3 arcsec ) in ra and declination ( figures  3a and 3b ; plate c ) .",
    "the vertical stripes associated with bright point sources arise due to scattering in the camera , but subtract out well as seen below .",
    "the effective spatial resolution in these images is @xmath21.5 arcsec fwhm .",
    "finally , the continuum image was subtracted from the 2.122 image to give a pure h@xmath3 v=10 s(1 ) line image ( figure  4 , plate  d ) .",
    "the locations of the bright trapezium ob stars , bn , and irc2 are marked with white circles .",
    "intensity has been scaled logarithmically to enhance faint details , and residual images of some of the brighter stars are visible due to small interpolation errors .",
    "the bow - shocks and wake fingers described by allen & burton ( 1993 ) are seen to the north - west in the new h@xmath3 image shown in figure  4 , although they are not completely covered . as noted by schild ( 1996 ) ,",
    "there are also a number of short fingers in the south - east ; our new data reveals for the first time however , a direct counterpart to the north - west fingers in the form of a large faint bow - shock and wake extending over 80 arcsec ( 0.17pc ) above the trapezium ob stars . inside the fingers ,",
    "closer to their origin , the h@xmath3 emission is extremely clumpy .",
    "this feature was predicted by draine & mckee ( 1993 ) on the basis of the largely invariant h@xmath3 line ratios measured with large aperture spectrometers ( brand 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "these line ratios should vary considerably from tip to wake of a bow - shock , and thus for them to appear constant , draine & mckee ( 1993 ) argued that there must be many such bow - shocks within a spectrometer beam , and that the entire outflow must contain hundreds of clumps of diameter @xmath61  arcsec or so .",
    "the model of stone ( 1995 ) naturally predicts such a clumpy shell inside the elongated fingers as shown in figure  5 .",
    "( it must be remembered that the model is only a two - dimensional slice through the outflow , while the observed h@xmath3 image in figure  4 shows the full three - dimensional structure projected on the sky . )",
    "this comparison of model and observations brings into focus the vexing issue of the underlying geometry of the omc-1 outflow .",
    "the stone model starts with an idealized spherically symmetric wind , while in contrast , observations clearly show the real outflow to be elongated along the north - west / south - east axis .",
    "thus it has typically been described as bipolar ( sugai 1994 , 1995 ; erickson 1982 ; schulz 1995 ) .",
    "however , this apparent incompatibility between the data and model can be reconciled by noting that the omc-1 outflow is probably not _ intrinsically _ bipolar : it is unlikely that direct collimation occurs within a few au of the source as is thought to be the case in low - mass outflows .",
    "the region around the nominal irc2 includes a dense ridge of quiescent gas and dust with a hot core which runs from north - east to south - west , perpendicular to the dominant high - velocity ( hundreds of ) outflow axis ( murata 1992 ; genzel & stutzki 1989 ) .",
    "this ridge is associated with a low - velocity ( tens of ) outflow seen in molecular lines including so , sio , hco@xmath7 , and cs ( plambeck 1982 ; wright 1983 ; vogel 1984 ; murata 1991 ) , in which clumps of gas are thought to be in the form of an `` expanding doughnut '' around irc2 with a radius on the order of thousands of au ( plambeck 1982 ) .",
    "it is likely that the dense ridge and `` doughnut '' are some remnant of the original molecular cloud structure , with some suggestion that they may also be related to a putative circumstellar disk or torus around the outflow driving source ( murata 1991 ) .",
    "it seems as though the initially spherical shell and outflow interact with this large - scale density enhancement , and are then shaped into a more elliptical form , with perhaps some pinching at the waist ( sugai 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "further out , sugai ( 1995 ) suggest that the fingers arise as `` some parts of the outflow penetrate the expanding shell probably due to some inhomogeneities in the outflow and/or in the shell '' : it now seems clear that rayleigh - taylor instabilities are responsible for the transition from a shell to the fingers , as modeled by stone and discussed below in section  4 .",
    "the degree of shaping or effective collimation in the flow is , at present , uncertain , as it depends on the angle of flow with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "most observational results suggest that the molecular outflow is tilted out of the plane of the sky , with the north - west `` lobe '' pointing close to the line - of - sight towards the observer ( schulz 1995 ) .",
    "this appears to be confirmed by the detection at optical wavelengths of [ oiii ] emission associated with the tips of the north - west fingers , which are delineated at ir wavelengths by high excitation [ feii ] emission ( axon & taylor 1984 , allen & burton 1993 ) . to be detected in the optical , these tips",
    "must be emerging from the omc-1 molecular cloud into the foreground orion nebula , and indeed , the [ oiii ] emission is highly blue - shifted ( axon & taylor 1984 ) . by contrast , the receding south - east `` lobe '' may be pushing into denser material , accounting for its shorter and fainter appearance .",
    "however , based on their mid - ir h@xmath3 line profiles , parmar ( 1994 ) suggest the underlying outflow is very nearly _ in _ the plane of the sky , so the orientation remains somewhat ambiguous .",
    "however , it seems as though the degree of effective collimation in the outflow must be relatively small regardless , that the outflow has a wide opening angle ( geballe 1986 ) .",
    "a highly collimated flow almost along the line - of - sight would be strongly fore - shortened and show few if any long fingers , in contrast to the wide swath of long h@xmath3 fingers actually seen . on the other hand ,",
    "a flow in the plane of the sky should not show high velocity blue shifted emission unless it was again only loosely collimated .",
    "future measurement of proper motions and radial velocities for the h@xmath3 fingers will make it possible to determine the degree of collimation and the geometry of the flow with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "stone ( 1995 ) found that the bullets produced in their numerical model decelerated rapidly , and therefore they had to invoke a density gradient in the surrounding medium to explain the observed velocities .",
    "however , it appears that this rapid deceleration was a consequence of their adopting the extremely high sound speed of 20 in their ambient gas in order to maintain numerical resolution in the shell modeled by their computations .",
    "next , we discuss the consequences of setting the sound speed to a more reasonable value .    the characteristic time for stopping a dense cloud or bullet is of order @xmath8 , where the cloud - crushing time @xmath9 is the time required for a shock to propagate entirely through the cloud , and is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ratio of the bullet density to that of the ambient gas , @xmath12 is the radius of the bullet , and @xmath13 is its velocity through the background gas ( klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ) . for an isothermal shock , the compression ratio @xmath14 is given by the square of the mach number , so @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the initial velocity of the bullets after fragmentation of the shell and @xmath17 is the sound speed in the gas . as a strong lower - limit on @xmath16",
    ", we can take the present - day greatest bullet velocity of @xmath18 from allen & burton ( 1993 ) , from whom we can also take the mass @xmath19 of a typical bullet as @xmath20 .",
    "the excitation temperature of the co in the shell lies between 6090k ( snell 1984 ) , corresponding to sound speed @xmath21 .",
    "magnetic fields could raise the effective sound speed to as much as several , but no more .",
    "we assume that the mass @xmath22 of the gas responsible for the present day high - velocity co emission is a rough indication of the mass that was present in the spherical shell just before it fragmented .",
    "also , we assume a radius @xmath23 of @xmath220 arcsec as an estimate of the present shell size based on the transition from the inner clumpy shell to fingers in the h@xmath3 image . from these numbers",
    ", we can crudely estimate the local ambient density @xmath24 when the shell fragmented as @xmath25 .",
    "taking @xmath26 ( snell 1984 ) and a distance to the bn - kl complex of 480pc ( genzel 1981 ) , we find @xmath27g@xmath28 .    finally , we may rewrite the equation for the cloud - crushing time in terms of the typical bullet velocity and mass , shell density , and sound speed , to find @xmath29 where @xmath30/(400 ) , @xmath31 is the sound speed in , @xmath32/(10@xmath33g@xmath28 ) , and @xmath34/(10@xmath35 ) . as stone found , sound speeds of 20 will result in rapid deceleration due to the low density of the resulting bullets . however",
    ", realistic effective sound speeds of only a few will result in bullets dense enough to propagate much farther than is presently observed without strong deceleration .",
    "therefore , while we do not rule out a density gradient in the molecular cloud core surrounding the outflow ( indeed , one is suggested by the shape of the outflow and by the observation of optical emission from the outermost bullets ) , we find that no gradient is _ required _ to explain the bullets and fingers .",
    "it is worth considering the issue of how the h@xmath3 emission actually arises in the fingers .",
    "schild ( 1996 ) compute the thickness of the observed layer of warm ( t@xmath22000k ) h@xmath3 in the structure they call the `` north jet '' , finding it to be around 0.05% of the finger cross section .",
    "they speculate that this thin layer is formed as ambient h@xmath3 is entrained by some unseen jet of material , then heated above its dissociation temperature .",
    "however , within the stone ( 1995 ) model , there _ is _ no jet , and the natural explanation is that behind the high - velocity fragment , an expanding wake shocks ambient h@xmath3 , which then rapidly cools below observable temperatures ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) .",
    "schild also note that water masers have been observed coincident with fingers and with large proper motions pointing outwards in the same direction as the fingers .",
    "water masers are most easily produced by shocks in dense gas ( elitzur , hollenbach , & mckee 1989 ) , so this observation is also naturally explained by the fingers being bounded by shocks , as stone predict .",
    "therefore , on balance , we find that with suitable minor modifications , the stone model does a good job of describing how the omc-1 h@xmath3 outflow is formed , with our new images providing further observational support .",
    "there is , however , one _ ad hoc _ component in the stone model , namely a spherical wind from the driving source that is strongly time variable .",
    "there is little observational evidence for strong spherical winds from massive ysos on the large scales required ( although several massive ysos are known to have strong winds much closer in ; hoare 1994 ) .",
    "it follows that there is also little evidence for the strong time variability required by stone to accelerate the shell and reverse the effective gravity , leading to rayleigh - taylor instabilities and the resulting bullets and fingers .",
    "schild ( 1996 ) suggest that the need for time variability could be avoided if the fingers were produced by the thin - layer instability described by dgani , walder , & nussbaumer ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by vishniac ( 1994 ) , this instability depends on the existence of a bow - shock - like global geometry , and so can not explain the presence of instabilities at all points on the inner quasi - spherical bubble .",
    "the nonlinear thin shell instability described by vishniac ( 1994 ) is potentially relevant as it can fragment even a decelerating shell if the inner , driving shock is radiative ( garca - segura , mac low , & langer 1995 ) , as would be likely at the densities expected within a molecular cloud .",
    "however , no scenario has yet been proposed and simulated that can produce the observed high - velocity bullets and lower - velocity clumpy shell solely with the nonlinear thin shell instability .    returning to the basic model of stone ( 1995 ) ,",
    "we propose a modification that introduces time - variability in an outflow not through variations in a single source , but through non - synchronous formation and evolution of a cluster of sources .",
    "as noted in section  1 , recent observations have shown that the bn - kl complex appears to contain a small cluster of very young high - mass stars in the vicinity of the nominal irc2 , plausibly an extremely youthful analog of the nearby trapezium ob sub - group which illuminates the orion nebula .",
    "thus , our suggestion is that perhaps the shell or bubble described by stone was not created by a single stellar wind , but rather by two or more sources in the bn - kl complex at different stages of evolution .    in this scenario , a relatively weak source or group of sources",
    "may have swept up the original shell . the sharp increase in wind strength required to drive the rayleigh - taylor instabilities",
    "might then arise as a single new source ( for example , the deeply embedded source illuminating irc2 ) collapses , becomes luminous , and drives a powerful new wind into the bubble .",
    "the dynamical timescale required to create the present - day h@xmath3 fingers is short , on the order of only @xmath210@xmath36yrs ( 0.2pc at 200 ) .",
    "therefore , since the deeply embedded young stars may be up to 10@xmath37yrs old , the necessary `` desynchronization '' is relatively small , and the cluster could still be considered quasi - coeval .",
    "our new continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 line image of the omc-1 outflow confirms the clumpy inner shell structure predicted by the time - variable wind model of stone ( 1995 ) , and in addition , shows a new bow - shock and wake system to the south - east .",
    "the outflow appears to begin with a quasi - spherical wind as in the model of stone , but is subsequently loosely shaped or collimated by a large - scale density enhancement around the entire cluster of wind sources ( sugai 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "while the degree of effective collimation and the flow geometry remain uncertain at this time , high - resolution near - infrared imaging in h@xmath3 line using nicmos on the hubble space telescope and/or ground - based adaptive optics should allow us to measure proper motions of the knots , and in combination with radial velocities measured from spectroscopy , enable us to create a three - dimensional picture of the outflow .",
    "furthermore , such high - resolution images should allow us to characterize the clumpy structure of the inner shell on scales a full order of magnitude smaller than the present data .",
    "the ultimate goal would be to create a `` time history '' for the outflow , in order to determine which source or sources were responsible for the initial shell and its subsequent fragmentation .",
    "in addition , sensitive imaging at mid - infrared wavelengths ( 1020 and beyond ) at high spatial resolution on the new generation of 8-m class telescopes may help better reveal the geometry and energetics of the cluster of potential driving sources themselves .",
    "we would like to thank tom megeath for donating the 2.2 m time used to obtain the data presented here , jianjun xu and jim stone for providing figure  5 , and michael burton , c.  robert odell , michael smith , alain lioure , chris davis , antonio chrysostomou , and karl menten for interesting and useful discussions on the nature of the h@xmath3 outflow in omc-1 and its driving source .",

    "<S> we present new images of the omc-1 molecular hydrogen outflow , made using long - slit spectroscopy in order to accurately subtract the underlying continuum emission . these images reveal an extremely clumpy , quasi - spherical inner shell that breaks up at larger radii into bow - shocks and trailing wakes in the north - west , as originally described by allen & burton ( 1993 ) ; a fainter counter - finger to the south - east is newly discovered in the present data . </S>",
    "<S> while the outflow appears to be broadly bipolar , this is probably due to an interaction between an initially spherical wind from the source and a large - scale density enhancement surrounding it , rather than direct collimation imposed close to the source . </S>",
    "<S> the clumpy appearance of the inner shell confirms the prediction of the recent model of stone , xu , & mundy ( 1995 ) , in which a spherical and time - varying wind fragments a swept - up shell , producing high - velocity shrapnel , which in turn drives bow - shocks into the surrounding gas , resulting in the observed `` fingers '' . as an alternative to the single varying source proposed by stone </S>",
    "<S> , we speculate that several young sources in the bn - kl cluster may have been responsible for first sweeping up the shell and then fragmenting it . + </S>"
