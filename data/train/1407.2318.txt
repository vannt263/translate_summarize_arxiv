    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we report the detection of emission from water vapor ( h@xmath3o ) and absorption from the simple organic molecules formaldehyde ( h@xmath3co ) and formic acid ( hcooh ) in the inner regions of a number of ttss in the taurus - auriga star - forming region as revealed by their 57.5@xmath0 m spectra .",
    "we analyze the spectra of 13 ttss in the taurus - auriga star - forming region ( table 1 ) .",
    "we selected the sources with the strongest emission or absorption structures in the 57.5 @xmath0 m range not due to previously identified gas or solid - state species ( e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  pahs ) or ices @xcite from the @xcite sample . all 57.5@xmath0 m spectra included in our analysis were reduced and prepared by the same techniques ( including dereddening ) as described by @xcite and @xcite , including deriving uncertainties from half the difference between the spectra obtained at the 2 nod positions , and applying a 1% lower threshold to the relative uncertainties , such that any relative uncertainty less than 1% was set to 1% .",
    "the spectra treated this way includes the spectrum of v1057 cyg , a fu orionis object whose spectrum was shown by @xcite and suggested by those authors to have water vapor absorption bands over 57.5 @xmath0 m wavelengths .",
    "other spectra reduced and prepared this way include the class iii ysos , hbc 388 and lkca 1 @xcite , which were chosen because they have no dust emission in excess of 2% of the continuum over 535 @xmath0 m ( i.e. , the level of the flat field variation of the irs ; see the _",
    "spitzer_-irs handbook ) , so any structure seen in their spectra must be photospheric in origin .",
    "as such , they are useful to compare to our tts sample of 13 spectra .",
    "the spectra of ci tau , df tau , dr tau , fs tau , fz tau , gn tau , and rw aur a each show what appears to be an emission feature that peaks at @xmath66.6@xmath0 m .",
    "figure 1 shows this feature for rw aur a to be much larger in amplitude than the error bars on the data points composing the feature .",
    "the same is found for the other 6 spectra showing strong 6.6 @xmath0 m emission features in figures 2 and 3 . in table 1 , we quantify the significance of the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature by providing the ratio of the absolute value of the equivalent width of the feature to its uncertainty . for rw aur a and the other 6 stars showing strong 6.6 @xmath0 m emission features ,",
    "this ratio is always greater than 8 . in order to determine whether a feature was an artifact , we examined spectra of comparably bright ttss , including dp tau , aa tau , fn tau , gh tau , and hk tau ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to determine the consistency of the 57.5 @xmath0 m spectral band .",
    "the 5 comparison tts spectra from @xcite show hardly any spectral structure at all over these wavelengths ; instead , one sees smooth continuum for these 5 spectra .",
    "all of the 13 tts spectra we analyze in our study plus the 5 comparison tts spectra from @xcite have been reduced in a similar manner ; e.g. , variable column width aperture extraction , the use of rsrfs , etc .",
    "therefore , we believe the 6.6@xmath0 m emission features to be intrinsic to the ttss and not artifacts .",
    "the lack of this feature in class iii yso spectra ( e.g. , see the spectra of hbc 388 and lk ca 1 in figure 5 ) further argues against these features being artifacts .",
    "in general , the short - low detector of _ spitzer_-irs ( 514 @xmath0 m wavelength ) is very well behaved , not suffering from the degree of the `` rogue '' pixel phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that , for example , the long - high detector suffers .",
    "finally , the degree of mispointing measured in the cross - dispersion direction ( i.e. , along the length of the slit ) varies in our sample from less than 0.1 pixel width ( the short - low pixel width is 1.8@xmath7 ) to 0.8 pixel width . as shown by @xcite for the _",
    "spitzer_-irs mapping mode observation of dh tau , iq tau , and it tau ( aor # 3536128 ) , the dispersion - direction ( perpendicular to the length of the slit ) mispointing tracked with the cross - dispersion mispointing . therefore , mispointing of the observations does not seem to be responsible for the features seen at these wavelengths .",
    "it is also worth noting that some of these seven spectra showing strong 6.6 @xmath0 m emission also have significant absorption in the 5.7 @xmath0 m band .",
    "this includes fz tau , gn tau , rw aur a , and especially df tau .",
    "these four have 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption band equivalent width to uncertainty ratios greater than 5 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the spectra of dl tau , fx tau , hn tau , ip tau , iq tau , and v836 tau each show what appears to be an absorption band centered around 5.7@xmath0 m ( figures 4 and 5 ) . as with the emission features in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ,",
    "figures 4 and 5 show these absorption bands to be much larger in amplitude than the error bars on the data points composing the band .",
    "we computed the significance of this feature in a manner similar to how it was done for the 6.6 @xmath0 m emission feature and provide it also in table 1 .",
    "note that the significance of the 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption band is always greater than 4 .",
    "also , two of these 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption band exemplars , hn tau and ip tau , have 6.6 @xmath0 m emission feature equivalent width to uncertainty ratios greater than 3 ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus , the presence of the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature does not exclude the presence of the 5.7 @xmath0 m band , and vice - versa .",
    "we argue that the 6.6 @xmath0 m emission feature seen in the 57.5@xmath0 m spectra of some of our sample arises from emission from water vapor , h@xmath3o .",
    "specifically , the water vapor emission seen over these wavelengths comes largely from the @xmath1 = 10 bending mode of water vapor , as in the case of the features seen by @xcite in the spectrum of the bn / kl region of orion . in the @xcite bn / kl spectrum , the r branch ( @xmath8 m )",
    "lines are seen in absorption , the p branch ( @xmath9 m ) lines are seen in emission ; of the q branch lines , some are in absorption , while others are in emission .    in figure 1",
    ", we plot the spectrum and model of rw aur a. we begin with rw aur a to identify the most likely origin of the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "our model includes water vapor only in emission .",
    "full radiative transfer modeling is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we assume lte for our models , and for rw aur a , we assume a model with three components added together .",
    "we vary the temperature , column density , and inferred radius of emitting region to match the model to the data , judging the quality of fit by eye .",
    "we kept the model as simple as possible , but sufficiently complex so that the model fits the data well .",
    "the intensity of radiation emerging from each component is of the form    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the background intensity , @xmath12 is the optical depth of the slab of gas , and @xmath13 is the source function of the slab of gas ( i.e. , a planck function at the temperature of the gas ) .",
    "we assumed the water vapor to have a microturbulent velocity of 1 km s@xmath14 .",
    "because of the low resolution of these _ spitzer_-irs spectra , we have no information on the widths of the individual lines , as the water lines are not resolved , but our assumed microturbulent velocity is similar to the @xmath15 = 2 km s@xmath14 local line width assumed by @xcite for their gas modeling of _ spitzer_-irs spectra of protoplanetary disks . the temperature of the water vapor giving rise to the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature can not be much lower than 500k , or else the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature would become too weak to match the spectrum .",
    "we used the hitemp2010 line list for the main isotopologue of water vapor @xcite , and the hitran2012 line list for the main isotopologue of formaldehyde @xcite .",
    "for the partition function of these molecules at lower temperatures ( t @xmath16 75k ) , we use the partition functions available at the jet propulsion laboratory website @xcite . for partition functions at higher temperatures , we use hitran2008 @xcite .",
    "we then rebin the model to the spectral resolution of the irs ( r @xmath17 60 - 120 ) over these wavelengths .    for rw aur a",
    ", our model is a sum of the flux from 3 components , each of the form f@xmath18 = @xmath19i@xmath18 , where the intensity , i@xmath18 , for each is determined using equation 1 ( though some of the models use this equation iteratively to determine the emergent intensity for a more complicated geometry ; see section 3.2 ) , each component with its own independent solid angle .",
    "the first component is an isothermal slab of water vapor at 1100k of column density 1.7@xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath22 , with zero background intensity .",
    "the second component is a naked blackbody ( i.e. , no slab in front of it , so @xmath12 = 0 ) at 190k .",
    "both these two components have the same solid angle , which is equal to that of a face - on disk of radius 920@xmath23 at a distance of 139pc ( the assumed distance to the taurus / auriga star - forming region ; here , we follow * ? ? ?",
    "the third component features a 1400k blackbody behind an isothermal cloud of formaldehyde ( h@xmath3co ) at 500k of column density 7@xmath2010@xmath24 @xmath22 .",
    "the solid angle for the third component is equivalent to that of a face - on disk of radius 16.1@xmath23 at 139 pc .",
    "though the solid angle for the water emission is much greater than that for the h@xmath3co absorption , the actual abundance ratio of the two ( table 2 ) is roughly 8:1 in favor of water . perhaps the water giving rise to the spectral emission we see originates from a wider range of disk radii , while the formaldehyde originates from a narrower range . because we do not perform self - consistent radiative transfer modeling of the gas emission and absorption",
    ", we can not say much more about the relative locations in the protoplanetary disks of the water and the formaldehyde .",
    "the assumed column densities of water and formaldehyde are similar to or lower than the values for the molecules included in the model of aa tau by @xcite for wavelengths longward of 10 @xmath0 m . also , the solid angles of these components suggest regions in the inner few au of the protoplanetary disk , consistent with the water vapor inferred from modeling by @xcite . that our model produces a 6.6@xmath0 m emission feature means there must be a temperature inversion : the water vapor is hotter than the material underneath , further supporting an origin in the cooler disk regions in the inner few au .",
    "the maximum optical depth of any of the h@xmath3o lines in the model of rw aur a over 57.5@xmath0 m is @xmath17 0.01 , while the maximum optical depth of any of the h@xmath3co lines in the model is @xmath17 4.4 .",
    "the model matches the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature quite well , including the `` shoulder '' on the feature at 6.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "further , our model matches the overall shape of the 57.5 @xmath0 m spectrum quite well , with only a few excursions outside of the spectral error bars .",
    "the water vapor emission in our model also matches the minor emission bump seen at 6.85 @xmath0 m in the spectrum .",
    "we caution , however , that the `` features '' seen at 6.6 @xmath0 m , 6.85 @xmath0 m , etc are actually manifolds of multitudes of narrow water vapor lines that _ spitzer_-irs can not resolve at this low spectral resolution .",
    "for example , between 6.3 and 6.75 @xmath0 m in the rw aur a model ( roughly corresponding to the 6.6 @xmath0 m `` feature '' , or manifold ) , there are @xmath2 500 lines of peak flux @xmath2 0.05 jy in the unconvolved model .",
    "much of the water vapor emission seen over 57.5 @xmath0 m belongs to the water vapor @xmath1 = 10 bending mode that @xcite identified in their spectrum of bn / kl . between 5.66.1 @xmath0 m",
    ", the model is mostly within the error bars of the spectrum .",
    "the excursions over this range may be due to the simplicity of assuming absorption from formaldehyde at only one temperature ( 500k ) .",
    "for our model of rw aur a , we assume an abundance ratio of water to formaldehyde of @xmath17 8 ( table 2 )",
    ". a range of temperatures of formaldehyde ( see the models of dl tau , hn tau , and iq tau in section 3.2 ) may improve the match of the model to the spectrum over this wavelength range .",
    "as further verification of the identity of the species giving rise to the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature , we model the spectrum of the fu orionis object , v1057 cyg .",
    "this star s",
    "_ spitzer_-irs spectrum was first presented by @xcite , who noted the presence of weak absorption bands between 57.5 @xmath0 m in many of the fu orionis type objects irs spectra , including that of v1057 cyg , and attributed these bands to water vapor .",
    "indeed , @xcite found emission from water in a herschel - pacs spectrum of v1057 cyg . following the suggestion of @xcite",
    ", we constructed a model of water vapor absorption for this object s spectrum .",
    "the first model component is an isothermal cloud of water vapor at 800k of column density 6@xmath2010@xmath25 @xmath22 in front of a 950k blackbody subtending a solid angle equivalent to a face - on disk of radius 227 @xmath23 at a distance of 600pc @xcite , while the second model component is merely a 200k blackbody subtending a solid angle equivalent to that of a face - on disk of radius 1800 @xmath23 at a distance of 600pc @xcite . for model details , see table 2 .",
    "the microturbulent velocity assumed for the water lines in the v1057 cyg model is 10 km / s .",
    "the quality of the fit of the model to the v1057 cyg spectrum is quite remarkable , considering the simplicity of the model .",
    "the model also matches the manifolds between 5.25.8 @xmath0 m . in a number of ways",
    "the v1057 cyg spectrum is a mirror of the rw aur a spectrum : v1057 cyg ( rw aur a ) has a local maximum ( minimum ) at 6.3 @xmath0 m , a shoulder at 6.5 @xmath0 m , a local minimum ( maximum ) at 6.6 @xmath0 m , a local minimum ( maximum ) at 6.8 @xmath0 m , etc",
    ". one notable difference , however , is that the overall shape of the h@xmath3o absorption band in the v1057 cyg spectrum between 5.26.3 @xmath0 m is not mirrored in a pure emission band in the rw aur a spectrum . for comparison ,",
    "spitzer_-irs spectrum of a pure h@xmath3o emission band over these wavelengths can be seen in the spectrum of the lower - mass oxygen - rich agb star shown by @xcite .",
    "this supports our claim that there is absorption present in the rw aur a spectrum at these wavelengths , and that formaldehyde is a good candidate to explain this .",
    "we modeled the 6 other spectra showing strong 6.6 @xmath0 m emission features in a manner similar to how we modeled rw aur .",
    "the spectra and their best - fit models are shown in figures 2 and 3 , and the model parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "we conclude water vapor emission is responsible for the 6.6 @xmath0 m features seen in the observed spectra of rw aur a ( figure 1 ) and the 6 other ttss plotted in figures 2 and 3 .    for the spectra of fz tau , fs tau , and gn tau , we used models similar to that of rw aur a , in that we used water and formaldehyde ( figure 2 ) . as can be seen",
    ", the models match the observed data fairly successfully , matching the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature well .",
    "the model of fz tau additionally successfully matches the @xmath17 0.1 @xmath0 m wide manifolds at 6.85 , 5.7 , 5.9 , and 6.05 @xmath0 m .",
    "overall , the manifolds are weaker for fs tau , and its model reflects that . considering that the higher relative uncertainties on the data for gn tau , the model fit is still satisfactory .",
    "the spectra of dr tau , df tau , and ci tau require absorption from a molecule other than formaldehyde , as formaldehyde produces an absorption band too wide for these spectra , especially for df tau ( figure 3 ) . instead ,",
    "for the models of these spectra , we replace formaldehyde with formic acid ( hcooh ; line list for the main isotopologue from hitran2008 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "again , the models match the spectra fairly successfully . for df tau , the formic acid absorption feature matches the absorption band very well in strength , width , central wavelength .",
    "it even matches the `` dimple '' at the bottom of the feature , around 5.65 @xmath0 m .",
    "the model of dr tau mostly matches the manifolds seen in its spectrum .",
    "the model of ci tau also matches its spectrum well , though the relative uncertainties are somewhat higher than the other spectra in figure 3 .      the other 6 tts spectra in our sample of 13 show either weak 6.6 @xmath0 m emission features or none at all .",
    "rather , they show strong absorption bands centered at 5.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "we note that these absorption bands are centered at too short a wavelength to be consistent with water ice absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "organic ice mixtures are another possibility to consider .",
    "such ices involve mixtures of h@xmath3o , ch@xmath5oh , nh@xmath5 , co , ch@xmath26 , h@xmath3co , and other molecules , in varying ratios , both without and with ultraviolet photolysis , at varying temperatures @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these organic ice mixtures are similar in that , though features begin appearing around 5.7 @xmath0 m , the features grow stronger toward 10 @xmath0 m wavelength .",
    "the same is true for kerogen and murchison meteorite organic residue @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of h@xmath3co : nh@xmath5 ice at 10k after deposition shown by @xcite is somewhat different in that its 5.8 @xmath0 m feature is stronger than the other features out to 10 @xmath0 m ; however , the 5.8 @xmath0 m does not match the central wavelengths of the absorption bands we observe in our tts sample .",
    "such behavior observed in the infrared spectra of all these studies of organic solids and ice mixtures is not observed in our spectra , so we do not attribute the 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption in our tts spectra to such organic solids and ice mixtures .",
    "these 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption bands are clearly seen in the spectra of dl tau , hn tau , iq tau , fx tau , ip tau , and v836 tau ( figures 4 and 5 ) and are also seen for some of the stars showing the 6.6 @xmath0 m emission feature ( see previous subsection ) . for the model of rw aur",
    "a ( figure 1 and section 3.1 ) , we modeled this absorption by including formaldehyde , h@xmath3co , in our model , in addition to water vapor .",
    "we do the same for hn tau ( figure 4 ) , as it seems to have a weak 6.6 @xmath0 m emission feature .",
    "however , the 57.5 @xmath0 m spectra of the other 5 spectra in figures 4 and 5 seem to require no water vapor in their models .",
    "figure 4 shows the spectra and models of dl tau , hn tau , and iq tau .",
    "these models of dl tau , hn tau , and iq tau assume there is a layer of cold formaldehyde in front of a layer of warmer formaldehyde , in front of a hotter blackbody , and that the solid angle of the layers and blackbody are the same ( table 2 ) .",
    "the model for hn tau additionally includes a separate component of water vapor emission . in order to compute the part of the emergent spectrum giving rise to the absorption band , equation 1 is used iteratively , such that the first iteration determines intensity i@xmath27 from radiation emerging from the first layer , where the hot blackbody is i@xmath28 , the source function of the lower ( warmer ) formaldehyde layer is s@xmath27 , and @xmath12 is the optical depth of the lower formaldehyde layer .",
    "the intensity determined from this first iteration , i@xmath27 , becomes the background intensity , i@xmath28 , for the second iteration of equation 1 , where s@xmath27 in the second iteration is the source function for the gas in the upper ( cooler ) formaldehyde layer , and @xmath12 in the second iteration is the optical depth of this upper formaldehyde layer .",
    "the warmer formaldehyde provides much of the absorption over the entire band , though less so at the center .",
    "the cooler formaldehyde provides the rest of the absorption at the center of the band .",
    "the maximum optical depth of any of the lines of formaldehyde over 57.5 @xmath0 m comprising this model is @xmath611 .",
    "as noted previously , the absorption bands seen in our sample at these wavelengths seem to break down into two types : a wider band and a narrower band .",
    "the three spectra shown in figure 4 have the wider band and are well modeled by formaldehyde .",
    "this wider band typically spans the region 5.46.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectra of fx tau , ip tau , and v836 tau , shown in figure 5 , have the narrower absorption band that is too narrow to be fit by formaldehyde , which fit the wider bands shown in figure 4 .",
    "this narrow band typically spans about 5.455.85 @xmath0 m . for these 3 spectra",
    ", we assume absorption from formic acid instead of formaldehyde . as with the models in figure 3",
    ", the formic acid produces a narrower band in each model shown in figure 5 that mostly matches the observed absorption features .",
    "the best match is for v836 tau , in terms of the width , strength , and central wavelength of the band , though the relative uncertainties are somewhat large . for ip tau ,",
    "the strength of the band is well modeled , though the model band is a little narrower and shifted slightly to longer wavelengths than the band seen in the data .",
    "the same is true for fx tau , with a discrepancy between model and data perhaps slightly greater than was true for ip tau .",
    "we also include in figure 5 the spectra of two class iii ysos without any dust excess .",
    "these spectra - hbc 388 , a k1 star , and lkca 1 , an m4 star - demonstrate that the photospheric contribution to any features seen at 57.5 @xmath0 m is very minor , if present at all .",
    "the spectral types of these stars span most of the range of the spectral types for our sample of tts ( table 1 ) .",
    "hbc 388 shows hardly any absorption bands over these wavelengths at all .",
    "lkca 1 shows a very shallow absorption band at 6.37 @xmath0 m that is possibly due to water vapor in the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "however , excess infrared emission for our sample of ttss essentially `` fills in '' such bands in the stellar photosphere spectra of our ttss .",
    "the ratios of the observed flux at 6.3 @xmath0 m ( which , relatively free from water vapor lines , should give the best indication of the local dust continuum ) to the inferred stellar photosphere flux ( interpolated at this wavelength from the photospheric seds plotted for our tts sample by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at this wavelength , @xmath29 , are all very high , between 3.8 ( fx tau ) and 31.8 ( hn tau ; see figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "thus , the emission and absorption features and bands that we model in our tts spectra are circumstellar in origin , not photospheric .",
    "we selected our sample of 13 ttss from taurus / auriga because they showed the strongest 6.6 or 5.7 @xmath0 m features .",
    "however , these features are seen in other tts spectra from the taurus / auriga star - forming region .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present study to model the emission seen in all such stars .",
    "however , it is relatively simple to measure the equivalent widths , central wavelengths ( defined in the same sense as they were defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and integrated fluxes for our spectra .",
    "equivalent widths provide a relative measure the strength of the emission or absorption features , while integrated fluxes provide an absolute measure of such strengths .",
    "the central wavelengths are important , especially for the 5.7 @xmath0 m band because the central wavelength of the feature shifts according to the type of molecule providing the absorption ( shorter central wavelength for formic acid , longer central wavelength for formaldehyde ) .",
    "our modeling work informs these measurements by suggesting the wavelength ranges to fit continua and to measure central wavelength , equivalent width , or integrated flux .",
    "we began by determining continua for the 6.6 and 5.7 @xmath0 m features .",
    "we fit a power law continuum of the form f@xmath30 = 10@xmath31 to the data just outside each feature by least - squares ; we used 5.365.429 and 6.0266.10 @xmath0 m for the 5.7 @xmath0 m band and 6.2656.34 and 6.77.0 @xmath0 m for the 6.6 @xmath0 m band . after determining the continuum to use for each feature , the equivalent width and integrated flux ( defined as the difference between observed spectrum and computed continuum , integrated over the band )",
    "was computed over 5.4286.026 @xmath0 m for the 5.7 @xmath0 m band and 6.346.7 @xmath0 m for the 6.6 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "we computed these equivalent widths and integrated fluxes for all the ttss analyzed by @xcite except for 4 ",
    "coku tau/4 , dm tau , gm aur , and lk ca 15  as these ttss have inner holes in their disks , so that there is little to no disk emission over 57.5 @xmath0 m wavelength .",
    "next , we measured the central wavelengths of these features . to do this , we integrated , channel - by - channel across the features over",
    "the same wavelength ranges used to measure equivalent widths , from each end towards the other until we reached the first channel that put the channel integration sum over 50% of the total integrated flux within the feature .",
    "we then interpolated between this channel and the previous one to determine the wavelength corresponding to exactly 50% integrated flux .",
    "this was performed in both increasing and decreasing wavelength directions .",

    "the three h@xmath3co absorption exemplars ( dl tau , hn tau , and iq tau ; see figure 4 ) do have 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption band central wavelengths ( 5.668 , 5.733 , and 5.728 @xmath0 m , respectively ; see table 1 ) systematically long - ward of the central wavelengths for the same band in the 3 hcooh absorption exemplars ( fx tau , 5.560 @xmath0 m ; ip tau , 5.597 @xmath0 m ; and v836 tau , 5.656 @xmath0 m ; figure 5 ; table 1 ) .",
    "however , very little in the way of significant correlations were found .",
    "figure 6 shows the 5.7 @xmath0 m equivalent width versus the 5.7 @xmath0 m central wavelength . for smaller equivalent widths",
    ", there is a wide range of central wavelengths , but for the larger equivalent widths , the central wavelength ranges only between about 5.65.7 @xmath0 m , which is consistent with the modeling described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "we computed the correlation coefficient , r , and the probability of a correlation coefficient of equal or greater magnitude being found for a non correlated data set @xcite , p , in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "we found r = 0.18 and p = 16% for the pair of 5.7 @xmath0 m equivalent width and 5.7 @xmath0 m central wavelength , so there is no correlation between this pair .",
    "we also searched for a trend between the 5.7 @xmath0 m and 6.6 @xmath0 m features equivalent widths .",
    "these are plotted in figure 7 . for this pair",
    ", we also find no correlation , with r = 0.24 and p = 6% .",
    "one pair that illustrates the typical sort of weak trend found between an equivalent width or central wavelength is between the spectral continuum index , n@xmath32 , measuring the continuum color in the infrared spectrum @xcite , and the 5.7 @xmath0 m central wavelength .",
    "this is plotted in figure 8 , with r = -0.31 and p = 2% , indicating there is a very weak indication of more negative 13-to-31 micron spectral index ( bluer color ) with increasing 5.7 @xmath0 m central wavelength . however , at a glance , little correlation of note appears in figure 8 .",
    "more negative n@xmath32 index suggests a more settled disk @xcite .",
    "the trend would thus suggest that more settled disks tend to have the absorption band shifted to longer wavelengths , presumably because of greater h@xmath3co abundance relative to hcooh .",
    "this potential trend should be explored in a larger sample of tts spectra .",
    "caution , however , is urged in attempting to interpret a correlation between n@xmath32 index and 5.7 @xmath0 m central wavelength .",
    "of the seven stars with strong h@xmath3o emission ( see section 3.1 ) , @xcite report @xmath17 17 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o line fluxes from _ spitzer_-irs short - high ( @xmath17 1019 @xmath0 m ) spectra for four : ci tau , dr tau , fz tau , and rw aur a. by widening the comparison to all stars in common between the @xcite sample and all stars in our sample for which we measure equivalent widths and integrated fluxes , we obtain a sample of 23 stars .",
    "we plot in figure 9 the 17 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o line fluxes from @xcite versus the 6.6 @xmath0 m integrated fluxes we measure .",
    "there is a definite correlation between the @xcite 17 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o line flux with our 6.6 @xmath0 m integrated fluxes of r = 0.79 and p = 0.1 % .",
    "@xcite note that h@xmath3o lines in the 1618 @xmath0 m region are high - excitation ground state lines .",
    "@xcite found that water relaxes from its stretching modes , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , by first transferring to the bending overtone , @xmath1 = 2 , then to the bending fundamental , @xmath1 = 1 , then to the ground state ; thus , the bending mode of water is strongly coupled to the rotational levels in the ground state ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the correlation between the rovibrational 57.5 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o emission and the 17 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o ground state lines could be consistent with non - lte excitation of these h@xmath3o ground state lines by radiative pumping through the h@xmath3o @xmath1 = 1 mode .",
    "as @xcite summarize , modeling by @xcite and observations by @xcite and @xcite suggest radiative pumping from the star enhances rovibrational h@xmath3o emission from protoplanetary disks .",
    "we urge caution , however , as this sample size is somewhat small ( 23 ) . in the future",
    ", we will compare the 6.6 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o feature to the 17 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o line fluxes in a larger sample .",
    "we note the temperatures required ( @xmath2500k ) to fit the 6.6@xmath0 m features in the 7 stars that have this feature are consistent with the temperature required to fit the @xmath2 1034 @xmath0 m spectrum of aa tau , 575k , shown by @xcite .",
    "the water vapor in the circumstellar disk of aa tau was inferred by @xcite to arise from the inner regions of its disk ( @xmath35 3 au ) .",
    "we similarly suggest the water vapor to be located in the inner regions of the protoplanetary disks whose spectra we show .",
    "the h@xmath3co absorption exemplars , dl tau , hn tau , and iq tau , all seem to require 2 temperatures of h@xmath3co to fit their 5.7 @xmath0 m absorption bands . as noted previously , the cooler 50k component is added to `` fill in '' absorption at the center of the band that the warmer 500k component could not do by itself . in reality , the h@xmath3co probably spans a range of temperatures in these disks , but we opt for simplicity in our modeling .",
    "the same is likely true for hcooh and h@xmath3o in our wider sample .",
    "one point of comparison for our work is to the model of molecular emission by @xcite from rw aur a as seen in its high resolution _ spitzer_-irs spectrum .",

    "thus , we likely probe different disk conditions . the water vapor in our model of rw aur",
    "a has a lower column density spread out over a larger range of radii , so perhaps the hotter water vapor is located higher up in the atmosphere .",
    "thermo - chemical modeling shows hot water vapor relatively high in the disk atmosphere ( @xmath21000k gas located 1 au above midplane at r = 3 - 4 au from the star ; see figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is more likely that the higher resolution spectra modeled by @xcite simply provide better constraints on the water vapor than the low resolution short - low 57.5 @xmath0 m spectra we model . the higher resolution _",
    "spitzer_-irs spectra begin to separate emission lines ( though such spectra do not necessarily outright resolve them ) , while short - low over 57.5 @xmath0 m does not begin to resolve water emission lines .",
    "@xcite suggest that protoplanetary disks that have experienced greater settling of dust to disk midplane , and therefore have higher gas - to - dust ratios in the upper disk layers , will have increased line - to - continuum ratios of emission from water vapor at infrared wavelengths .",
    "@xcite compared spectral indices from radiative transfer models that include the effects of dust settling @xcite to observed spectral indices for ttss in taurus / auriga and find that the mid - infrared continuum colors in general become bluer when there is greater dust settling and the disks become flatter .",
    "@xcite measured the colors between 613 and 1331 @xmath0 m using the indices n@xmath37 and n@xmath32 , which we cite for our sample in table 1 .",
    "our sample s n@xmath37 indices range from -1.39 to -0.62 , while our samples n@xmath32 indices range from -1.09 to 0.03 .",
    "as seen in figure 7 of @xcite , such indices are consistent with a large fraction of the taurus / auriga tts population , and as seen in figure 22 of @xcite , this range of indices indicates significant settling , consistent with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "however , as we discussed in the previous subsection , we do not see trends between 6.6 @xmath0 m equivalent width and either of the continuum color indices , n@xmath37 and n@xmath32 .",
    "perhaps any such trend is weak and might be found if our sample included more flared disks ( i.e. , with more positive indices ) .",
    "we investigated the critical densities of the water vapor lines in the 57.5 @xmath0 m region to determine how sensitive they might be to the degree of disk flaring ( i.e. , from dust settling ) in protoplanetary disks . using a list of energy levels for the ground ( rotation - only ) and first few vibrational states for both ortho- and para - water from @xcite",
    ", we followed the methodology of @xcite and computed the sum of the einstein a - coefficients of permitted downward radiative transitions and the sum of the collisional rate coefficients for h@xmath3-h@xmath3o ( also from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for each possible level , and divided the former by the latter for each level .",
    "we determined the allowed transitions for the first few vibrational levels of water using the selection rules described by @xcite . from the @xcite collisional rate coefficients",
    ", we obtain critical densities of about 10@xmath38 to 10@xmath39 @xmath40 for the first 45 levels ( i.e. , the ground state ) of both ortho- and para - water .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than the 10@xmath41 to 10@xmath42 @xmath40 determined by @xcite for water using levels and collisional rate coefficients from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that their lower rates may be in error by up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude , which perhaps helps explain this discrepancy .",
    "however , the @xcite collisional rate coefficients have the advantage of covering a wide range of transitions , and , thus , self - consistency . the lines in the 57.5 @xmath0 m region giving rise , in large part , to the emission seen in our models that match the observed spectra are mostly @xmath1 = 10 transitions ,",
    "though a few @xmath1 = 21 transitions also contribute",
    ". the critical densities of these lines assuming the @xcite collisional rate coefficients are in the range of about 10@xmath41 to 6@xmath2010@xmath42 @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the critical densities giving rise to the 57.5 @xmath0 m water emission are , on average , an order of magnitude or two higher than those giving rise to the pure rotational transitions of water seen longward of 10 @xmath0 m wavelength , suggesting the 57.5 @xmath0 m water lines arise from denser disk regions .",
    "thus , one might expect that the disks with least dust settling may hide their water vapor emission , assuming the scale height of the dust in the inner few au of the disks increases sufficiently as a result of the increased flaring .",
    "our model of the fu orionis star v1057 cyg is interesting in that it lacks absorption from hcooh or h@xmath3co , unlike the ttss in our sample .",
    "its spectrum is fit well with absorption _ only _ from h@xmath3o at 800k in front of a 950k blackbody of radius 1.1 au , with additional continuum emission from a 200k blackbody of radius 8.4 au .",
    "a glance at the spectra of other fu orionis stars shown by @xcite suggests they have absorption features in the 57.5 @xmath0 m range largely or totally due to water vapor .",
    "both having water vapor absorption instead of emission and lacking hcooh and h@xmath3co absorption seems to differentiate this small sample of fu orionis stars and our tts sample .",
    "the water vapor absorption profiles of fu orionis stars is likely due to internal heating from viscous accretion , while the water vapor emission profiles of tts s is likely due to external heating by stellar irradiation .",
    "the 5 fu orionis stars studied by @xcite are among the least extinguished ( flat spectrum ) fu orionis stars by several different indices @xcite . those with more extinction show absorption from various ices over the 57.5 @xmath0 m range typical of class 0/i protostars @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected formaldehyde in the tts disk of tw hya and in the disk of the herbig ae star hd 163296 at millimeter wavelengths using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "they propose that formaldehyde may form from hydrogenation of co ice .",
    "@xcite constructed psuedo - time - dependent models of molecules in a young protoplanetary disk , though it is not clear how these models perform concerning formaldehyde .",
    "formic acid has been detected before from star - forming regions at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite also expect formic acid to play a significant role in disk chemistry . one major formation pathway for hcooh gas comes from dissociative recombination of ch@xmath5o@xmath43 , which itself comes from a hco@xmath44+h@xmath3o reaction @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that formaldehyde ( h@xmath3co ) and formic acid ( hcooh ) are chemically very similar , exchanging an h in formaldehyde for an oh in formic acid .",
    "thus , it may be no coincidence that we see formaldehyde present in some tts disks and formic acid in other tts disks .",
