    "the general dynamical sampling problem can be stated as follows : let @xmath6 be a function in a separable hilbert space @xmath11 , e.g. , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and assume that @xmath6 evolves through an evolution operator @xmath14 so that the function at time @xmath15 has evolved to become @xmath16 .",
    "we identify @xmath11 with @xmath2 where @xmath17 in the finite dimensional case , @xmath18 in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the standard basis of @xmath2 .",
    "the time - space sample at time @xmath20 and location @xmath21 , is the value @xmath22 . in this way we associate to each pair @xmath23 a sample value .",
    "the general dynamical sampling problem can then be described as : under what conditions on the operator @xmath1 , and a set @xmath24 , can every @xmath6 in the hilbert space @xmath25 be recovered in a stable way from the samples in @xmath26 .    at time @xmath27 , we sample @xmath6 at the locations @xmath28 resulting in the measurements @xmath29 . here",
    "the measurements @xmath31 that we have from our original signal @xmath32 will contain in general insufficient information to recover @xmath6 . in other words , @xmath6 is undersampled .",
    "so we will need some extra information from the iterations of @xmath6 by the operator @xmath1 : @xmath33 .",
    "again , for each @xmath15 , the measurements @xmath29 that we have by sampling our signals @xmath34 at @xmath35 are insufficient to recover @xmath34 in general .",
    "several questions arise .",
    "will the combined measurements @xmath29 contain in general all the information needed to recover @xmath6 ( and hence @xmath34 ) ?",
    "how many iterations @xmath36 will we need ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) to recover the original signal ?",
    "what are the right `` spatial '' sampling sets @xmath35 we need to choose in order to recover @xmath6 ? in what way all these questions depend on the operator @xmath1 ?",
    "the goal of this paper is to answer these questions and understand completely this problem that we can formulate as :    let @xmath1 be the evolution operator acting in @xmath2 , @xmath38 a fixed set of locations , and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a positive integer or @xmath41    [ gendysamp ] find conditions on @xmath42 and @xmath39 such that any vector @xmath43 can be recovered from the samples @xmath0 in a stable way .",
    "note that , in problem [ gendysamp ] , we allow @xmath44 to be finite or infinite .",
    "note also that , problem [ gendysamp ] is not the most general problem since the way it is stated implies that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , an underlying assumption is that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 . for each @xmath49 ,",
    "let @xmath50 be the operator from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , defined by @xmath53 and define @xmath26 to be the operator @xmath54    then @xmath6 can be recovered from @xmath0 in a stable way if and only if there exist constants @xmath55 such that @xmath56 using the standard basis @xmath57 for @xmath2 , we obtain from that @xmath58 thus we get    [ eqv1]every @xmath59 can be recovered from the measurements set @xmath60 in a stable way if and only if the set of vectors @xmath61 is a frame for @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical sampling problem has similarities to other areas of mathematics . for example , in wavelet",
    "theory @xcite , a high - pass convolution operator @xmath25 and a low - pass convolution operator @xmath36 are applied to the function @xmath6 .",
    "the goal is to design operators @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath36 so that reconstruction of @xmath6 from samples of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is feasible . in dynamical sampling",
    "there is only one operator @xmath1 , and it is applied iteratively to the function @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath1 may be high - pass , low - pass , or neither and is given in the problem formulation , not designed .    in inverse problems ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , a single operator @xmath64 , that often represents a physical process , is to be inverted . the goal is to recover a function @xmath6 from the observation @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath64 is not bounded below , the problem is considered an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "dynamical sampling is different because @xmath66 is not necessarily known for any @xmath15 ; instead @xmath6 is to be recovered from partial knowledge of @xmath34 for many values of @xmath15 . in fact , the dynamical sampling problem can be phrased as an inverse problem when the operator @xmath64 is the operation of applying the operators @xmath67 and then subsampling each of these signals accordingly on some sets @xmath35 for times @xmath27 .",
    "the methods that we develop for studying the dynamical sampling problem are related to methods in spectral theory , operator algebras , and frame theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the proof of our theorems [ noframe0 ] and [ notframe2 ] , below , use the newly proved @xcite kadison - singer / feichtinger conjecture @xcite .",
    "another example is the existence of cyclic vectors that form frames , which is related to carleson s theorem for interpolating sequences in the hardy space @xmath9 ( c.f . ,",

    "application to wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) is a natural setting for dynamical sampling . in wsn ,",
    "large amounts of physical sensors are distributed to gather information about a field to be monitored , such as temperature , pressure , or pollution .",
    "wsn are used in many industries , including the health , military , and environmental industries ( c.f . ,",
    "@xcite and the reference therein ) .",
    "the goal is to exploit the evolutionary structure and the placement of sensors to reconstruct an unknown field .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "if it is not possible to place sampling devices at the desired locations , then we may be able to recover the desired information by placing the sensors elsewhere and use the evolution process to recover the signals at the relevant locations .",
    "in addition , if the cost of a sensor is expensive relative to the cost of activating the sensor , then , we may be able to recover the same information with fewer sensors , each being activated more frequently . in this way ,",
    "reconstruction of a signal becomes cheaper .",
    "in other words we perform a time - space trade - off .",
    "in section [ fdc ] we present the results for the finite dimensional case .",
    "specifically , subsection [ dt ] concerns the special case of diagonalizable operators acting on vectors in @xmath12 .",
    "this case is treated first in order to give some intuition about the general theory . for example , theorem [ tad0 ] explains the reconstruction properties for the examples below : consider the following two matrices acting on @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69    for the matrix @xmath70 , theorem [ tad0 ] shows that any @xmath71 can be recovered from the data sampled at the single `` spacial '' point @xmath72 , i.e. , from @xmath73 however , if @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 the information is not sufficient to determine @xmath6 .",
    "in fact if we do not sample at @xmath76 , or @xmath72 , the only way to recover any @xmath71 is to sample at all the remaining `` spacial '' points @xmath77 .",
    "for example , @xmath78 is enough data to recover @xmath6 , but @xmath79 , is not enough information no matter how large @xmath80 is .",
    "for the matrix @xmath81 , theorem [ tad0 ] implies that it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath71 if the number of sampling points is less than @xmath82 .",
    "however , we can reconstruct any @xmath71 from the data @xmath83 yet , it is not possible to recover @xmath6 from the set @xmath84 for any @xmath36 .",
    "theorem [ tad0 ] gives all the sets @xmath8 such that any @xmath71 can be recovered from @xmath85 .    in subsection [ glt ] problem [ gendysamp ]",
    "is solved for the general case in @xmath12 , and corollary [ tadcul - cor ] elucidates the example below : consider @xmath86    then , corollary [ tadcul - cor ] shows that @xmath8 must contain at least two `` spacial '' sampling points for the recovery of functions from their time - space samples to be feasible .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 is enough recover @xmath89 .",
    "however , if @xmath8 is changed to @xmath90 , then @xmath91 does not provide enough information .",
    "the dynamical sampling problem in infinite dimensional separable hilbert spaces is studied in section [ dsid ] . for this case",
    ", we restrict ourselves to certain classes of self adjoint operators in @xmath13 . in light of lemma [ eqv1 ] , in subsection [ completeness ] , we characterize the sets @xmath92 such that @xmath93 is complete in @xmath13 ( theorem [ complete ] ) .",
    "however , using the newly proved [ 28 ] kadison - singer / feichtinger conjecture [ 11 , 9 ] , we also show that if @xmath8 is a finite set , then @xmath94 is never a basis ( see theorem [ nonbasisfiniteomega ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the obstruction to being a basis is redundancy .",
    "this fact is proved using the beautiful mntz - szsz theorem [ ms ] below .    although @xmath93 can not be a basis ,",
    "it should be possible that @xmath95 is a frame for sets @xmath96 with finite cardinality .",
    "it turns out however , that except for special cases , if @xmath97 is a finite set , then @xmath95 is not a frame for @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath8 consists of a single vector , we are able to characterize completely when @xmath95 is a frame for @xmath13 ( theorem [ onepointframe ] ) , by relating our problem to a theorem by carleson on interpolating sequences in the hardy spaces @xmath9 .",
    "in this section we will address the finite dimensional case .",
    "that is , our evolution operator is a matrix @xmath1 acting on the space @xmath12 and @xmath98 .",

    "since a frame is transformed to a frame by invertible linear operators , condition ( [ frame ] ) is equivalent to @xmath107 being a frame of @xmath12 .",
