    "the lack of galaxies beyond @xmath29 in our deep fields support this hypothesis ; and we may be already proving the first galaxies emerging from the dark ages . under the simple hypothesis that reionization happened gradually between @xmath29 and @xmath30 and that this reionization took place in a patchy form , we should expect a statistically significant variability in the number density of detected galaxies at @xmath31 when comparing different deep fields ( for instance from the hubble frontier fields ( , * ? ? ?",

    "candidate selection was performed using typical lbg dropout critieria , searching for lbg candidates using their distinct color around @xmath51 .",
    "the criteria are as follows : for candidates at @xmath528 , the lyman break is at @xmath53 , between the f814w and f125w bands : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "a strong requisite is that a candidate should not be detected above @xmath64 in images bluer than the lyman break . for @xmath65 objects ,",

    "* ) , which includes several changes with respect to its original version ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "in particular , we use a new library composed of six sed templates originally drawn from projet dtude des galaxies par synthse volutive @xcite but then re - calibrated using fireworks photometry and spectroscopic redshifts @xcite to optimize its performance .",
    "in addition to these basic six templates , four graphite and silicate ( @xmath71 ) and one @xmath72 template have been added .",
    "this new library , already adopted by the clash collaboration @xcite , includes five templates for elliptical galaxies , two for spiral galaxies and four for starburst galaxies , along with emission lines and dust extinction .",
    "the opacity of the intergalactic medium was applied as described in @xcite .",
    "bpz2.0 also includes a new empirically derived prior based on the redshift distributions measured in the goods - music @xcite , cosmos @xcite and udf @xcite catalogs .",
    "however , since the galaxies considered in this work are ( typically ) beyond the redshift range employed to constrain the bpz2.0 priors , we preferred to assume an ignorant ( i.e. , flat ) prior on both galaxy type and redshift , since there is no guarantee that a simple extrapolation to the high - z universe may not introduce an unexpected bias in the analysis .",
    "as already emphasized by several authors @xcite , photo - z s should not be treated as exact estimates , but as probability distribution functions ( pdf ) in a bi - dimensional ( redshift vs spectral - type ; i.e. , z - t ) space .",
    "although it is true that for high signal - to - noise detections the pdf can be well - approximated by a gaussian distribution , for faint detections the photometric uncertainties make these distributions highly non - gaussian and completely asymmetric .",
    "a further difficulty arises when a sufficiently large wavelength - range coverage is not available ( or the photometry is not deep enough ) to simultaneously identify at least two distinct prominent spectral features ( as is usually the case for the detection of very high - z galaxies ) , enabling more than one solution to fit the input photometric data equally well .",
    "this problem , known as the color - redshift degeneracy , makes the pdf bimodal since the 4000 - break from an early - type galaxy at low - redshift can not be distinguished from the lyman - break of a late - type galaxy at high - redshift .",
    "this high - to - low redshift misclassification problem is of major importance in the identification of high - z candidates .",
    "however , since this bimodality represents two independent scenarios for a single galaxy ( early - type / low - z or late - type / high - z , see figure [ fig : pdz ] ) , the global pdf can be easily separated into two independent redshift distributions , as expressed in equation [ phzeq1 ] :    @xmath73    this simple separation between `` red '' templates ( @xmath74 ) and `` blue '' templates ( @xmath75 ) renders it possible to make simple comparisons between both scenarios .",
    "following the same philosophy used by @xcite , we express the normalized global pdf for every galaxy in terms of the probability of having an early ( @xmath76 ) or a late ( @xmath77 ) spectral - type solution , as indicated in equation [ phzeq2 ] :    @xmath78    likewise , we define ( eq . [ phzratio ] ) the peak - probability ratio @xmath4 as the ratio between peak - probabilities ; i.e. , between the values that each distribution takes as its peak ( or maximum ) , such that :    @xmath79    this number approximates how many times one solution is more likely than the other , and so makes possible to quantitatively flag potential high - z candidates .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl : photoz ] , where both the photometric redshift estimations and the peak - probability ratios are presented for every photometrically selected candidate , we find a total of 15 `` potential '' candidates lie at z@xmath807 if we impose a minimum threshold of @xmath81 .",
    "if this condition is relaxed to @xmath82 or @xmath83 , we obtain 22 and 38 candidates , respectively . the resulting redshift distribution ( when applying the different threshold criteria ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zhist ] . to be on the conservative side",
    ", we consider as high probability only those high - redshift candidates with @xmath82 .",
    "moreover it is interesting to note that the use of @xmath82 instead of @xmath83 suggests a contamination rate of @xmath8440% , in the order of what is found in previous surveys ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we know the peak ratio @xmath4 is probably not the best estimate , it is just the simplest and _ good enough _ for our purpose .    in tables",
    "[ tbl : z7p]-[tbl : z7 ] we present identifications , positions and photometry for all our selected candidates with @xmath82 . in figures  [ fig : stamps - c ] , [ fig : stamps - p1 ] , and [ fig : stamps - p2 ] , we show cutout images of all the @xmath82 candidates . in the discussion that follows we only consider these candidates and use these",
    "bpz based redshifts for all further calculations , e.g. luminosity function , physical properties , etc .",
    "we derive magnifications for the different candidates from a selection of lens models publicly available through the mast archive . in order to maintain consistency among these models ,",
    "we select only those that incorporate the cluster members into the lens model .",
    "in particular , we use the two models delivered by the _ sharon_-team @xcite , the two models delivered by _ zitrin & merten_-team @xcite and one model delivered by the _ cats_-team @xcite .",
    "in addition to these five models , we include also the free - form model from @xcite which , as the models above , includes the contribution from cluster members to the lens model .    based on these six models we compute the mean magnifications at the corresponding redshifts for the candidates listed in table  [ tbl : z7 ] as well as the dispersion in the magnification between the different models .",
    "the candidates that are further away from the critical curves show smaller dispersion between the predicted magnification values .",
    "the critical curves for one of these models @xcite together with the position of the candidates around the central part of the cluster are shown in figure [ fig : fov ] .    for candidates near the critical curves , we use the model to predict potential counter - images .",
    "variations in the predictions of counter images are expected between different models specially near the critical curves . for candidate 8958",
    "we find that the models predict 2 additional counter - images .",
    "the precise location varies depending on the particular model but with a fair agreement between different models . based on the @xcite model",

    "one possible source of contamination to the high-@xmath89 sample is from low-@xmath89 interlopers ( e.g. @xcite ) that could fulfill all the selection criteria defined for very high - redshift objects .",
    "we estimated the contamination by this type of source by simulating a population of galaxies based on the distribution of galaxies in our dataset .",
    "we first build this `` contaminant sample '' by selecting all objects that are brighter than the brightest candidate selected in the field ( f160w@xmath6825.5 ) and that are detected at more than 2@xmath50 in optical bands ( for the parallel field we used the same limit even though we selected one object at f160w=24.18 , see discussion below ) .",
    "we then matched the luminosity distribution of the bright objects to the luminosity of our candidates .",
    "we measured the noise around each object to update the photometry of the contaminants sample .",
    "finally we applied the same selection criteria as those we used for the high-@xmath89 selection : all the objects that enter the selection window are contaminants . as a first step ,",
    "we only applied the classical lbg selection criteria ( non - detection and color - selection ) and found a contamination rate of @xmath2128% for the cluster sample and @xmath2142% for the parallel sample .",
    "we then applied to the selected contaminants the peak probability ratio method and found that all the objects in the contaminants sample display a ratio r @xmath90 2 , such that they are not selected as good candidates .",
    "moreover , the high-@xmath89 sample can also be contaminated by m , l and t dwarfs exhibiting colors similar to what is required for high-@xmath89 galaxies .",
    "we used observed spectra of such stars published in @xcite and @xcite and showed that this kind of contaminant has the following colors : f105w - f140w@xmath901.0 and f140w - f160w@xmath900.4 .",
    "therefore , among our samples , 9 objects are consistent with these colors , and require further investigation .",
    "we measured the size of these nine objects following the method described in @xcite correcting for psf broadening and amplification , and demonstrated that all 9 objects are resolved on hst images .      among our two samples ,",
    "one @xmath918 candidate appears extremely bright ( f140w @xmath21 25.5 ) without being strongly amplified because it is located in the parallel field ( # 5296 ) .",
    "the expected number of such bright objects in the full frontier fields dataset ( @xmath2132 arcmin@xmath92 according to @xcite ) assuming the evolution of the uv luminosity function found by @xcite is ( @xmath93)@xmath4410@xmath94 .",
    "we also note that only one object with f140w@xmath90 24.5 is expected in the final release of the ultravista survey @xcite , implying that a high - redshift hypothesis is unlikely . in order to asses whether this extreme object is an interloper or a bona fide high - redshift galaxy , we perform several tests .",
    "we first study the non - detection in the optical bands by applying the @xmath95 method defined in @xcite .",
    "we compare the distribution of @xmath95 measured in empty apertures all over the field with the distribution of @xmath95 for mock objects detected at @xmath212@xmath50 in all acs bands , and show that all sources with @xmath960.4 are most likely contaminants .",
    "the @xmath95 of our source is in perfect agreement with the @xmath95 measured in empty apertures [ @xmath95(#5296)=-0.04 ] .",
    "however , we notice a possible faint detection of that object on the f814w image ( @xmath6830.1 ) that could make unlikely the @xmath918 hypothesis , but that confirms a huge break between optical and nir data of at least 4.5 mag .",
    "the star hypothesis was studied by measuring the size of this object and by comparing its colors with expected colors of m , l and t dwarfs , that could be similar to those of very high-@xmath89 objects .",
    "we measured its size using the sextractor flux_radius parameter which encloses 50% of the light , as described in @xcite , and corrected this value for psf broadening .",
    "this shows that this object is clearly resolved , and assuming that this object is at @xmath91 8.36 , its physical size would be 0.55 kpc , which is consistent with the observed evolution of size as a function of uv luminosity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as in @xmath395.1 , we compared the colors of this candidate ( f105w - f140w=1.7 and f140w- f160w=0.31 ) to those expected from m , l and t dwarfs ( f105w - f140w@xmath901.0 and f140w - f160w@xmath900.4 ) , finding that they are incompatible .",
    "the last hypothesis we study for this target is the possibility that it is a moving object .",
    "we took benefit from the 4 epochs during which the parallel field has been observed with wfc3/hst , which span over 1 month .",
    "we ran sextractor on each epoch image and compared the centroid position for that object ; it shows no evidence of movement .",
    "next , we characterize the physical properties of our high - redshift candidates by means of the bayesian spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling code isedfit @xcite . using the same setup and parameter set",
    "as used in @xcite , we generated 80,000 models seds with _ delayed _ star - formation histories using a monte carlo technique .",

    "we note that our seds are generally best - fitted with the models having little or no dust attenuation , obtaining a median @xmath108 of @xmath109  mag , and a similar median stellar mass [ @xmath110 and age @xmath111  myr ] as those reported previously without considering dust attenuation .",
    "yet , dust has a big impact on the sfrs , its median value increases by a factor of two from @xmath104  yr@xmath8 to @xmath112  yr@xmath8 .",
    "the reported median values are based on the median values of each posterior probability distribution .",
    "finally , since the physical - property estimation depends on the photometric redshift assumption , we also use isedfit to calculate photometric redshifts .",
    "the comparison of these results allow us to evaluate how reliable is our estimation of the physical properties based on bpz redshifts .",
    "we generate 40,000 seds models adopting the same ssp models , stellar libraries , parameterization of the star formation history , and imf as used in the previous calculation of the physical properties including dust ( @xcite curve and @xmath107 $ ]  mag ) . nevertheless , in order to additionally encompass possible low - redshift interlopers , we model these seds within a broader range of uniform priors on age @xmath113 $ ]  gyr , star - formation timescale @xmath114 $ ]  gyr , stellar metallicity @xmath115 $ ] than previously . despite the fact",
    "that isedfit was optimized to estimate the physical properties and not photometric redshifts , we note that the photo - z s obtained with isedfit and bpz2.0 are reassuringly similar .",
    "isedfit tends to recover slightly higher photo - z s compared to bpz2.0 , although the values are consistent within the error bars , yielding a mean difference of @xmath116 ( isedfit minus bpz2.0 ) . since there are no substantial differences between the photo - z s based on bpz and isedfit , except for the candidate 5296 , we can rely on the physical properties estimation based on the bpz redshift .",
    "it excludes the outlier high - redshift candidate 5296 , where both photometric redshifts clearly differ , @xmath117 and z(isedfit)=@xmath118 . hence in table 6 , we report the physical properties according both photometric redshifts for this particular candidate .",
    "these physical properties agree with the results of @xcite .",
    "the relatively small size of our sample and their faintness does not allow us to draw a firm conclusion regarding a star - forming main - sequence is in place at z@xmath686 .",
    "nevertheless , we do confirm that our candidates do conform to the reddening - stellar - mass plane proposed by @xcite : @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "the deep images obtained from frontier fields observations and the amplification of the light coming from background sources by the cluster allow probe a large range in intrinsic luminosities , thereby allowing us to constrain the uv luminosity function to unprecedentedly faint levels .",

    "* we choose a random probability , @xmath122 , that assigns a redshift , @xmath123 for each object from the cumulative redshift probability distribution such that @xmath124=@xmath122 * we use this redshift and the sed of each object to estimate their uv luminosity corrected for amplification . * steps 1 and 2 are repeated @xmath125 times in order to get a sample with @xmath125 times the size of the original sample , but with the same redshift distribution .",
    "we adopt a value @xmath125 large enough so as to not affect the final result ( in our case @xmath126 ) * we distribute all the objects with a redshift included between @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 or 10 , in magnitude bins and correct each object for incompleteness .",
    "* each number is corrected by the contamination rate .",
    "* we compute the effective surface explored by the macs0416 dataset by matching the amplification map with the detection picture , and then divide the number of objects per magnitude bin by the comoving volume explored between @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 or 10 .",
    "* uncertainties on each density are computed using the method described in @xcite    the number densities are then corrected for incompleteness due to the extraction methods and the selection criteria we apply to catalogs .",
    "the selection function we use to build our high - z samples involves the `` standard '' lyman break technique @xcite and the use of the p(z ) ration between early type and late type galaxies .",
    "therefore we divided the completeness of our sample into two parts , corresponding to each selection criteria we used , as follows : @xmath130 the first part of the previous equation , @xmath131 , is the incompleteness due to the lyman break technique and more especially to the extraction method and color criteria we used . to estimate the shape of this function , we simulate 680,000 galaxies from the latest starburst99 library ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and other theoretical templates ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the space parameters we used had magnitudes ranging from 22.00 to 31.00 and redshift from 6.5 to 10.5 .",
    "we then defined an object mask from the detection picture to identify positions where no object is detected and then added the simulated objects to the real data , without masked objects .",
    "we assumed a log - normal distribution of the size of very high - redshift objects with a mean value of 0.15  and a sigma of 0.07  as expected from previous studies ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we then used the same extraction software and selection criteria as defined in section [ sec : selection ] and compared the number of extracted objects with the number of simulated objects .",
    "the second part of eq.[eq.compl ] , @xmath132 , is computed from a mock catalog containing @xmath8450000 objects with redshift ranging from 0 to 12 and a luminosity distribution matched to the @xmath916 luminosity function published in @xcite .",
    "we run bpz2.0 and computed for each object the ratio between the probability for this object to be an early type ( low-@xmath89 ) galaxy and the probability to be a late type galaxy ( high-@xmath89 ) .",
    "the completeness is computed by applying the p(z ) selection criteria to this mock catalog and by comparing the selected sample with the number of high-@xmath89 simulated objects .",
    "the number densities we found are reported on table [ tbl : densities ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that one object at @xmath9110 is strongly amplified ( @xmath13320 ) and thus allows us to give for the first time a robust constraint in the faint - end ( @xmath134 ) of the uv lf at @xmath9110 .",
    "this result is consistent with the shape of the lf observed at the brightest luminosities at such high - redshift .",
    "recently several papers have demonstrated that the role of foreground galaxies in the amplification of the light coming from very high - redshift objects is negligible ( @xmath901% ) for objects selected in hst surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we only corrected photometry for lensing by galaxies cluster in both fields .",
    "one also has to bear in mind that lensing itself introduces incompleteness to the reconstructed luminosity function . while the so called magnification bias ( broadhurst et al . 1995 ) , which preferentially biases towards the detection of more magnified objects in lensed fields , is effectively folded in our derivation of the lf , there are other lensing - related biases that need to be addressed . for example , oesch et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have shown that both shear ( or the apparent change in shape of lensed images ) and source blending , have a noticeable effect on the reconstructed lf , biasing the derived sfrd by order @xmath135 dex .",
    "robertson et al . (",
    "2014 ) , have shown that cosmic variance  because of the smaller source plane area being effectively probed with lensing  is higher and becomes quite significant in lensed fields . in that sense ,",
    "lfs compiled from a single lensed field may be substantially biased compared to the blank field lfs .",
    "fialkov & loeb ( 2015 ) show that particularly for lyman - break high - redshift galaxies , incompleteness from various factors including also the surface - brightness slope of the lensed galaxies , is important to account for ( for other discussions of such effects see also wong et al .",

    "we adopted the schechter parametrization @xcite to study the evolution of the shape of the uv lf from @xmath917 to 10 .",
    "the three parameters were deduced using a @xmath136 minimization approach using the densities estimated in this study combined with previous results .",
    "errors bars at @xmath917 , 8 and 9 were deduced from the 1@xmath50 confidence interval . given the paucity of objects currently known above @xmath9110 , we fixed the value of m@xmath137 for the @xmath9110 lf to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "our parameterization is consistent with what is expected from the uv lf evolution @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the different lfs are shown on figure  [ fig : lf ] and the values of the three schechter parameters are given in table  [ tbl : lf ] .",
    "* at @xmath13810 , our candidate is located in a highly magnified region leading to a large 1@xmath50 error bar on the amplification .",
    "we took into account these uncertainties by computing the corresponding number densities over the amplification range covered by the 1@xmath50 interval .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf ] shows that the 3 constraints we deduce follow the same shape .",
    "however to not bias the estimation of the schechter parameters , we only fitted the uv lf using the density computed assuming the mean amplification ( @xmath13320.50 ) .",
    "we note that the best fit follows the shape described by both densities computed assuming different amplification values .",
    "*      the  data for macs0416 have been available since september 2014 , and two papers focusing on the brightest objects at @xmath36 and 9 have been published recently ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a key difference between our selection and the one used in @xcite is the redshift interval covered by the color - criteria .",
    "the selection window we used to select the highest redshift objects is well - defined over a redshift range between 6.5 and 10.5 ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : completeness ] ) whereas figure  2 of @xcite shows that their window is primarily devoted to the selection of objects between 7.5 and 8.5 .",
    "we note that two objects in our sample were not selected in @xcite : one of these , 1859 , fails to satisfy the magnitude cut they applied , which only selects relatively bright candidates in the field .",
    "@xcite selected five objects using a purely photometric redshift approach , among them four are in common with the sample described in this paper ( 491 , 8428 , 1213 and 1859 in our sample ) , while one object is not ( i d = hff2c-9 - 5 ) .",
    "note that our candidate 4008 is not in the redshift range they targeted .",
    "in order to study the properties of young galaxies in the era of reionization , we characterize 22 galaxies between @xmath20 - 10 discovered in the m0416 cluster ( @xmath139 ) and parallel fields .",
    "four of these galaxies were previously reported by @xcite and four by @xcite .",
    "our selection employed data from the  optical , @xmath140 and @xmath141 bands , as well as deep hawki / vlt @xmath48 and irac 3.6 and 4.5  images . to find candidates , we carried out careful and strict color selection .",
    "simulations indicate that the completness in our sample ranges between 65% and 85% at redshifts between 7 and 10.0 .",
    "photometric redshifts were calculated using a new version of the bayesian photometric redshifts code ( bpz2.0 ) .",
    "we develop a new quality criteria based on the ratio between peak early and late galaxy type probabilities ( @xmath4 ) , and chose candidates with peak - probability ratios @xmath142 . furthermore , to test the reliability of our redshift estimations we used isedfit , which produced very similar results , with a mean difference of only @xmath116 ( isedfit minus bpz2.0 ) .",
    "magnifications are computed for the different candidates at the corresponding redshifts from an combination of six well selected models available in the mast archive .",
    "we looked for counter images for objects near critical curves . in the case of 8958",
    ", we search for images at two positions predicted by our models .",
    "although there are some extremely faint red objects at these positions , no conclusive identifications could be reached .",
    "based on an sed analysis with isedfit , we computed stellar masses , star formation rates and ages for each candidate .",
    "our @xmath102 candidates are consistent with having mean stellar masses of @xmath143  , sfrs of approximately @xmath104  yr@xmath8 , and sfr - weighted ages of @xmath144  myr .",
    "these measurements agree with the results of @xcite .    finally , based on candidates in m0416 cluster and parallel fields",
    ", we computed lfs at @xmath145 & 10 .",
    "thanks to the depth of s , we are able to give the first * direct estimates * on the faint - end of the uv lf at @xmath9110 . * the constraints given in table  [ tbl : lf ] are clearly stronger than in previous studies .",
    "* this confirms the crucial role of the s to detect object beyond the limit of current telescopes .",
    "the schechter parameters are relatively well - constrained at @xmath146 and 8 regarding the number of objects in each samples . at higher redshifts , however , the full frontier fields dataset will be required to increase the number of sources and reduce the cosmic variance effects .",
