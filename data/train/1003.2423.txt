    "outflows can manifest themselves as jets and knots of shocked material visible at optical and near - infrared wavelengths and also molecular emission observable at longer wavelengths .",
    "the outflowing material plays a role in removing the excess angular momentum from the ysos allowing them to evolve into stars .",

    "k. our calculations show significant dissociation of h@xmath2 with increasing density .",
    "figure 4 shows the irac color space for dissociatively shocked gas .",
    "as the molecular hydrogen gets dissociated , emission from the co @xmath16=10 band begins to dominate the 4.5 @xmath1 m irac channel .",
    "the relationships between temperature , density and color are different for the case of the non - dissociative shock and the case of the dissociative shock .",

    ", it may be possible to distinguish between the cases .",
    "a pixel density distribution , produced from binning the colors of each pixel in the the outflow , can reveal the nature of the outflow by showing where most of the pixels lie in color space .",
    "it should be noted that the irac color analysis assumes dust and pah emission is negligible . in order to prevent dust emission from affecting the color analysis ,",
    "the 8 @xmath1 m irac color is not used as there is evidence in some shocks of continuum dust emission within that wavelength range covered by the 8 @xmath1 m channel ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "the irac 8 @xmath1 m image of the outflow region reveals patches of absorption against the diffuse background ( figure 1 ) . of particular interest is a dark patch seen in absorption that bisects the outflow .",

    "however , this is not able to account for the total extinction in the line of sight toward the outflow . nonetheless , the temperature - color relation is insensitive to extinction for non - dissociative shocks .",
    "we estimate the background using a ring median filter and subsequently remove this background from the irac 3.6 @xmath1 m , 4.5 @xmath1 m , and 5.8 @xmath1 m images .",
    "a ring median filter is a median filter from which only the pixels within an annulus are used in calculating the median @xcite .",
    "the scale of this filter needs to be larger than the scale of the shocked emission otherwise the background will be overestimated , yet small enough to account for the large scale background fluctuations .",
    "the images were shifted and registered with each other and then irac colors at each pixel location were determined .",
    "figure 5 shows the pixel density in irac color space for the knots of the outflow . due to the lack of pixels whose colors are in or near the co dominated region and our criteria above for non - dissociative shocks ,",
    "we conclude that this shock is mostly non - dissociative and we can therefore estimate the thermal structure based on color analysis .",
    "we compared the colors to those of non - dissociative shocked gas with the cutoff [ 4.5][5.8 ] @xmath42 1.5 .",

    "we find that most of the nir h@xmath2 knots are spatially coincident with the high temperature regions of the flow .",
    "however , knots a and v do not have a corresponding irac derived temperature .",
    "the nir images reveal stars in the line of sight for these knots which add to the emission and prevents irac color analysis from deriving temperatures .",
    "seven of the knots have estimated temperatures greater or equal to @xmath43 k. by combining the nir infrared and temperature data it is possible to estimate the extinction towards the brightest knots .",
    "for this we used the extinction cross - sections of @xcite .",
    "the median extinction to the knots is a@xmath44 = 27 .",
    "the knots j and k in the vicinity of the dark clump have higher extinction compared to the rest of the knots .",

    "we show that irac color analysis can be used to interpret the interaction of an outflow with its surrounding environment . using our calculations of the irac space of non - dissociative shocked gas we fit analytic forms to the color - temperature and column density - temperature relationships .",
    "we verify that irac color analysis can reveal regions of shocked gas and find that the nir h@xmath0 knots correspond to regions of high temperature and or column density determined through color analysis .",
    "we find diffuse mips 24 @xmath1 m emission , most likely from [ ] lines , to be coincident with regions of high temperature thus confirming the validity of using the non - dissociative shock irac color space the nir line ratios combined with the temperature estimates allow for the determination of extinction along the line of sight which is used to create a column density map of the shocked h@xmath0 gas .",
    "we deduce that the asymmetry in the outflow is due to interactions with the dense material to the west of the outflow source causing deflection and possibly deceleration of the outflowing material .",
    "we thank mike butler for running his extinction mapping code on the irac data and providing the mass surface density data shown in figure 8 .",

    "we thank our referee , john bally , for his useful comments and suggestions .",
