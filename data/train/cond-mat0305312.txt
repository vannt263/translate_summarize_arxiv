    "the identification of active species for desired chemical reactions is a main quest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis .",
    "@xcite whether a species is active or not depends on many factors , including the nature of its interaction with the catalyst material , as well as the temperature and pressure at which the catalytic reactions take place .",
    "the main approach for gaining quantitative , microscopic understanding of various properties and processes , has been to perform experiments under standard surface science conditions , i.e. , under ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) and relatively low ( room or lower ) temperatures , with the hope that what is learnt may be relevant and/or extrapolated to the system under the `` real '' catalytic conditions of high temperatures and pressures .",
    "theoretical studies of adsorption and reactions at surfaces have , at best , been carried out by first - principles approaches , which , while highly accurate , typically do not take into account the temperature or the gas - phase environment with which the surface is in contact . a recent focus , both experimentally and theoretically , is to attempt to study systems which more closely resemble those of true catalytic ones .",
    "@xcite experimentally , this is done by performing _ in situ _ real - time measurements carried out under high temperature and pressure conditions , and by the systematic study of , e.g. , well - characterized metal clusters deposited on support materials and chemical reactions thereon ( see e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "such studies are important in particular for understanding those systems which exhibit a `` pressure- and/or materials - gap '' , i.e. , where different behavior is exhibited under low and high pressures , or when results for model single - metal catalysts do not represent those of the `` real '' catalyst , typically consisting of a dispersed metal on a support material .",
    "often the pressure- and materials - gaps are related and occur simultaneously .    the oxygen ",
    "silver system is an example which exhibits a pronounced pressure - dependence : despite its unique activity as _ the _ catalyst for ethylene epoxidation ( c@xmath3h@xmath4o@xmath5 c@xmath3h@xmath6o , performed at 500 - 600  k and atmospheric pressure ) and partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde ( ch@xmath7oh+@xmath8o@xmath9 ch@xmath3o+ h@xmath3o - `` oxydehydrogenation '' , or by direct dehydrogenation , ch@xmath7oh @xmath10 ch@xmath3o+h@xmath3 , performed at 700 - 900  k and atmospheric pressure ) , these reactions do not occur with any significant probability under uhv conditions .  @xcite this behavior of the oxygen ",
    "silver system might be related to a materials - gap , because for studies of the partial oxidation of methanol , drastic differences are observed in the performance for fresh silver catalysts and those which have been exposed to high temperature ( @xmath11  k ) and pressure ( atmospheric ) conditions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the conversion of the clean ag material to the active catalyst exhibits a pronounced hysteresis , i.e. , the conversion is different when raising the temperature from low to high , compared to from high to low .",
    "this was the case for high temperatures up to 873  k , as well as for lower temperatures up to 560  k and 750  k. these hysteresis effects were shown from scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) studies to be related to significant morphological changes which occur in the catalyst depending on the temperature , and that do not revert to the original structure when lowering the temperature , i.e. , the changes are irreversible .  @xcite structural changes in silver also occur when in contact with a _ pure _ o@xmath3 environment at high temperatures ( @xmath12900  k ) and atmospheric pressure , namely , facets with the ag(111 ) orientation result .  @xcite this is presumably because under these conditions it is unlikely that there will be any oxygen on the surface and the ( 111 ) surface of ag has the lowest surface energy .",
    "it has been suggested that the elusive sub - surface or `` bulk - dissolved '' oxygen species play an essential role in the above - mentioned catalytic reactions , which so far have escaped a precise characterization .",
    "@xcite in addition to this aspect , there are other controversial debates in the literature concerning the nature of the active species , e.g. , atomic versus molecular ( ozone - like ) oxygen .",
    "@xcite another puzzling issue is how silver , as a noble metal , can function as a good catalyst when it only binds adparticles relatively weakly on the surface compared to the transition - metal catalysts to the left of it in the periodic table .",
    "catalysis clearly involves a number of complex processes , namely the dissociation of molecules and the creation of chemically active species , and subsequent interaction and reaction between the particles to form the product , which desorbs from the surface .",
    "furthermore , it is possible ( maybe likely ) that some fragments of the reactant molecules ( e.g. , h or c ) modify the catalyst material and thereby participate in the creation of the active species . in the present paper",
    "we tackle only part of the problem , namely , the study of the interaction of silver with oxygen in order to identify and exclude possible active o species for the above - mentioned heterogeneous catalytic reactions .",
    "this is an essential prerequisite for modeling the full catalytic process .",
    "although we study explicitly the ( 111 ) surface of silver , our general findings are expected to be relevant for silver _ per se _ , and possibly to have implications for gold , also a noble metal oxidation catalyst  @xcite which , for the ( 111 ) surface , exhibits a restructuring and chemisorption of oxygen atoms at elevated temperatures ( 500800  k ) and atmospheric pressure ,  @xcite similar to ag(111 ) .",
    "they may also relate to copper , which catalyses the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde .",
    "@xcite    in our previous publications ,  @xcite the interaction between oxygen and ag(111 ) was thoroughly studied by density - functional theory ( dft ) . in these works we considered almost all possibly relevant oxygen species , namely , pure on - surface chemisorbed oxygen , pure sub - surface and bulk - dissolved oxygen , surface- and bulk - substitutional adsorption , structures involving both oxygen on and under the top ag layer , as well as surface - oxides and a molecular ( ozone - like ) species adsorbed at a surface vacancy .",
    "we studied these oxygen species for a wide range of coverages where the following results were obtained : at low coverages oxygen atoms adsorb on the surface . with increasing coverages",
    ", however , strong repulsive interactions develop between the partially negatively charged o atoms and the adatoms are driven to penetrate into the sub - surface region , and/or to give rise to a reconstructed , thin surface - oxide layer , when the coverage is larger than @xmath120.25  ml . for higher oxygen contents , thicker oxide - like films",
    "are predicted to form .",
    "we also found that the presence of sub - surface oxygen when bonded to the same surface ag atoms as an oxygen atom on the surface , dramatically modifies the electronic properties of the on - surface oxygen and vice - versa .",
    "depending on the particular geometry , it can give rise to a notable stabilization or destabilization , but the energetically favorable structures induce a _ stabilization _ and a lowering of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "in contrast to the conclusions concerning the crucial role of bulk - dissolved oxygen based on interpretations of experimental results , we found that this species is energetically _",
    "unfavorable _ , as is bulk- and surface - substitutional oxygen , as well as the molecularly adsorbed ozone - like species at a vacancy , when the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the binding energy of atomic oxygen adsorbed at under - coordinated silver atoms is considerably stronger than on the terraces , but the concentration of such species obviously depends on the number of defects and the morphology of the substrate .    nevertheless , temperature and pressure can affect the stability of structures and this has not been investigated so far . clearly this is important for gaining an understanding of the system under catalytic conditions and this is the main topic of the present paper . some of these results were reported briefly in ref .  .",

    "having studied the atomic and electronic structure of bulk ag@xmath3o and determined the thermodynamically most favorable surface of ag@xmath3o(111 ) , we now wish to investigate how a transition from the oxide - like structures , with positions of ag atoms commensurate with those of ag(111 ) , and laterally compressed by 14  % compared to the true oxide ( as reported in ref .  ) , to the real oxide structure might occur .",
    "such a commensurate oxide - like structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : commens+4x4 ] ( top ) for an o concentration of 1.25  ml . in order to investigate such a transition",
    ", we study the difference of the total energy ( per o atom ) between oxide - like films ( with commensurate ag positions to those of the metal substrate ) and corresponding `` real '' ( unstrained ) oxide layers as a function of thickness . because the structures can be thought of as the stacking of o - ag - o trilayers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oxide ] ) , we calculate the energy difference with increasing numbers of trilayers",
    ". then the number of layers at which the true oxide structure becomes energetically more favorable , defines a critical thickness for the transition to occur . in this approach",
    ", the coupling between the ( strained ) oxide - like film with the underlying metal substrate is not included .",
    "we note that this study may be somewhat `` academic '' since there is so far no evidence for such compressed oxide structures , however , this structure is a plausible intermediate and perhaps can even be stabilized under certain experimental conditions .",
    "furthermore , additional insight into the o / ag system can be obtained by these calculations , and moreover , when compared to analogous studies performed for other o / transition - metal systems , in particular for o / ru(0001 ) ,  @xcite various trends may be identified .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] .",
    "a negative value indicates that the true oxide structures are energetically more favorable .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] assumes that the number of o atoms is fixed .",
    "however , in many ( most ) experiments that aim to study very high coverages , the actual thermodynamic variable may be @xmath24 .    for one o - ag - o trilayer ,",
    "the `` strained '' [ commensurate with ag(111 ) ] oxide film is significantly more favorable than the corresponding true oxide , as indicated by the relatively large positive value of 0.53  ev , but the preference decreases quickly to 0.13  ev at three trilayers .",
    "on increasing the thickness further , the difference in the energy between the two structures decreases more slowly , and when the number of trilayers is nine , the true oxide film is energetically more favorable , as indicated by the negative value in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] .",
    "because each trilayer contributes half a monolayer of oxygen , the critical coverage for the transition from the commensurate oxide - like film to the true oxide film is around 3.5 - 4.5  ml .",
    "as the number of the trilayers approaches infinity , clearly the curve approaches the value corresponding to the energy difference ( per o atom ) between the bulk oxide and the `` strained '' [ commensurate with ag(111 ) ] bulk material .",
    "the electronic properties of the `` strained '' [ commensurate with ag(111 ) ] oxide film are very similar to those of the true oxide as can be seen from comparison of fig .  12 in ref .   with fig .",
    "[ fig : oxide - dos ] .",
    "this at first may be somewhat surprising since the lateral dimensions of the commensurate , oxide - like structures are smaller , by 14  % .",
    "we find , however , that much of the associated strain energy is relieved by expansion of the ag layers perpendicular to the surface to accommodate the o atoms in between . through this relaxation ,",
    "the lattice volume per atom is 92  % of that of the bulk oxide .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] , analogous results for the phase transition from o - ru - o trilayer structures ( commensurate with ru(0001 ) ) to the corresponding real ruo@xmath3(110 )  @xcite oxide layers are also presented for comparison .",
    "bulk ruthenium dioxide has the rutile structure .",
    "the atomic geometry of ruo@xmath3(110 ) is shown as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] , as is that of the ( commensurate ) trilayer and its expansion into a corresponding true ruo@xmath3(110 ) layer ( bottom , left ) .",
    "the commensurate trilayer structures are , laterally , 15  % and 35  % smaller than for ruo@xmath3(110 ) ( i.e. , in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 directions of the rectangular ( 110 ) surface unit cell ) . in this case",
    "the transformation from commensurate trilayer to corresponding oxide layer , involves not only a lateral expansion like for the di - silver oxide structures , but also a `` rotation '' of the o atoms about the ru atoms , as seen from the inset ( explained in more detail in ref .  ) .",
    "in particular , every second o - ru - o component rotates to be horizontal to the surface , while the alternative components rotate so that they are perpendicular to the surface .",
    "in contrast to the ag - o system , the phase transition into ruo@xmath13(110 ) oxide happens after only one o - ru - o trilayer .",
    "also , for ru(0001 ) , each trilayer contributes two monolayers of oxygen , so the critical coverage is around 2 - 4  ml . because of the considerable energy gain due to formation of the real ruo@xmath13 oxide layers , compared to continuous of stacking of the o - ru - o trilayers , the formation of the oxide structure will certainly take place once it is kinetically possible .    it is interesting to note that the energy differences of oxygen in the trilayers and the corresponding bulk metal oxide layers , exhibits a rather similar dependence on the number of layers for both o / ag and o / ru , except shifted in energy .",
    "this makes sense since we consider the energy per o atom , and as the stack becomes larger , there are more and more o atoms in the center of the stack which have atomic environments which are similar ( and thus similar energies ) , i.e. , the affect on the energy due to the surfaces of the layers , diminishes . in view of this similarity , together with the fact that the heat of formation of e.g. , the rh ( 1.19  ev ) and pd ( 0.97  ev ) oxides lie between the extremes of ru ( 1.60  ev ) and ag ( 0.33  ev ) oxides , we may expect that investigations of analogous transitions from commensurate structures to the bulk oxide phase for rh and pd would exhibit a behavior intermediate to those of ru and ag .",
    "this would imply the trend that the transition from intermediate , commensurate , two - dimensional oxide films to the true oxide phase , occurs sooner ( i.e. , for thinner films ) for the elements more to the left in the periodic table , like ru , with larger heats of formation , compared to those towards the right , which have smaller heats of formation like ag .",
    "from a recent trend study on the oxidation at the basal plane of late @xmath60 transition metals ( from middle to right in the periodic table , i.e. , ru , rh , pd , ag ) ,  @xcite it was found that oxygen starts to enter the sub - surface region only after a certain critical coverage has been reached on the surface .",
    "namely , at coverages beyond which the heat of oxygen adsorption on the surface becomes unfavorable compared to the heat of formation of the bulk oxide .",
    "the reported critical coverages are about 1.0  ml , 1.0  ml , and 0.75  ml , and 0.25  ml for ru , rh , pd , and ag , respectively . beyond these critical coverages ,",
    "onset of bulk oxide formation was proposed to take place .",
    "clearly , however , due to kinetic hindering , bulk oxide formation may _ not _ be able to occur `` immediately '' and then it may proceed via the formation of oxide - like layers as described above .",
    "we now turn to investigate the affect of the temperature and pressure on the stability of the various oxygen / silver structures , the energetics and atomic geometries of which were reported in our previous publications ;  @xcite in particular , the energies are summarized in fig .",
    "14 of ref .  .",
    "to incorporate the effect of temperature and pressure , we calculate the gibbs free energy as a function of the oxygen chemical potential ( cf .",

    "although the mentioned _ surface unit cells _ are ( practically ) commensurate , the positions of the ag atoms within the @xmath64 oxide surface cell are , all except one , incommensurate with those of the ag(111 ) surface .    it can be seen that for values of @xmath67 greater than @xmath68  ev , the commensurate oxide - like structures ( see e.g. , fig .

    "is @xmath470.48 ev per two silver atoms , and @xmath470.70 for ag@xmath3o per formula unit .",
    "@xcite thus , the entropy contribution from di - silver oxide , compared to silver bulk ( the entropy of o@xmath13 has already been included in the chemical potential ) , is greater by 0.22 ev per two silver atoms , which will shift the left vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] further to the left .",
    "therefore , in figs .",
    "[ fig : pt ] and [ fig : pt2 ] , we generally expect that the temperature is underestimated , but the error less than 110  k , while correspondingly , the pressure is overestimated , by less than three orders of magnitude . for the temperature values quoted below , we give an estimate of the upper limit in brackets , that is , 110  k higher than that obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] . in spite of these uncertainties",
    ", we believe that the relative stability of the various systems and our general understanding and conclusions will not be affected .",
    "typically , vibrational contributions to _ differences _ in the gibbs free energies of extended systems exhibit some cancellation .",
    "@xcite however , when there are additional atomic or molecular species which are not present in the reference system , the situation may be different as there will be no effective cancellation of the contributions of such species between surface and reference systems ( as is the case using the _ clean _",
    "ag(111 ) as reference ) .",
    "we investigate this aspect in more detail for the present system ; in particular , we consider low coverages of on - surface oxygen and thin oxide - like structures .",
    "we calculate the difference in the vibrational and entropic contributions to the gibbs free energy , @xmath71 , as , @xmath72 \\ }   \\quad , \\label{eq : vibr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the vibrations which enter eq .",
    "[ eq : vibr ] are those of the adsorbed o atoms .",
    "the calculated perpendicular vibrational frequency for 0.25  ml of oxygen in fcc sites on the surface is 50  mev ( 400  @xmath74 ) , and we assume that the lateral vibrations are the same ( this is a somewhat rough approximation but suffices for the present discussion , see below ) .",
    "thus , in calculating @xmath75 we multiply by a factor of three corresponding to these three modes . for the thin commensurate oxide - like structure containing one",
    "o atom on the surface in fcc sites and one sub - surface o in tetrahedral sites ( i.e. , a total coverage of 0.5  ml ) , the calculated perpendicular vibrational frequencies are 56  mev ( 455  @xmath74 ) and 65  mev ( 526  @xmath74 ) , respectively , for these two species . again , assuming each o atom has three modes equal to the perpendicular ones , we obtain the results presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : vibrations ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrations ] that for on - surface o , for temperatures up to about 800  k , the contribution is a maximum of about @xmath762  mev / @xmath77 . for lower coverages of on - surface o such as the 1/16 and 1/9  ml structures , the contribution will be smaller ( assuming the frequency is similar ) . for the oxide - like structure at coverage 0.5  ml ,",
    "the effect is larger , namely 5 - 6  mev / @xmath77 for temperatures up to about 400  k , thereafter decreasing . for the @xmath62 thin oxide structure with coverage 0.375  ml",
    ", we expect the vibrational frequencies of the o species will be similar to those of the structure at 0.5  ml since the local coordination of the o atoms is similar , as well as the electronic structure .",
    "in addition , the vibrational frequency of o in bulk ag@xmath3o is reported to be 66  mev ( 530  @xmath74 ) ,  @xcite which is very close to that of the o atom in the sub - surface tetrahedral site of the 0.5  ml coverage structure ( 65  mev ) .",
    "because of the lower o coverage of the @xmath62 structure , the contribution to the free energy will be smaller than the 0.5  ml structure by about 0.375/0.5 = 0.75 , giving a maximum contribution at low temperatures of 4.5  mev / @xmath77 ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrations ] ) .    for the @xmath78 structure , in the temperature range 400  k to 730  k , it gives rise to a destabilization of less than 3.5  mev / @xmath77 ( the value at 400  k , which decreases with temperature ) , which on inspecting the energy scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] can be seen to be non - negligible . the relative energy _ difference _",
    ", however between the on - surface species and @xmath78 structure , which determines the _ sequence _ of the stable phases , can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrations ] to be affected by less than 1.9  mev / @xmath77 ( @xmath79  mev / @xmath77 ) for temperatures greater than 400  k , which will therefore have a small effect .",
    "we note that if the lateral vibrations would be 30  % greater than the perpendicular ones for the on - surface and oxide - like structures considered , this would result only in a small increase in the contribution to the free energy , i.e. of 0.5 and 1.2  mev / @xmath77 , respectively , at @xmath19 close to zero .",
    "the above analysis may be regarded as qualitative , but it gives an estimate of the magnitude of the changes in the free energy due to consideration of vibrational and entropic effects of the extended systems for the energetically most important o / ag structures .",
    "clearly , for other systems with adsorbed species that have high frequencies such as oh ( of the order 400  mev ) ,  @xcite the contribution to the free energy from vibrational and entropic effects will be significantly greater and will have to be taken into account in determination of the phase diagram .    summarizing the results contained in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] , we obtain the following predictions : under uhv conditions ( @xmath80  atm . ) , chemisorption of oxygen on ag(111 ) with low coverage ( less than 0.0625  ml ) is stable up to about 360  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 470  k ) .",
    "this is in - line with experimental results  @xcite where it has been found that for temperatures less than 490  k , 0.03  ml of oxygen can be adsorbed on the ag(111 ) surface . under uhv conditions ,",
    "the calculations also predict the stability of the @xmath62 phase at the lower temperatures of 160  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 270  k ) to 260  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 370  k ) .",
    "this is also consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) results obtained under uhv conditions at low ( 4  k ) temperatures  @xcite where atomic resolution images of the @xmath62 phase have been achieved .",
    "the @xmath62 phase , however , can not be directly prepared under these conditions as it is known from experiment that temperatures greater than 400  k are required in order for the necessary atomic rearrangement take place .",
    "it is therefore clear that it is the kinetics that prevent the reconstruction and formation of this phase at low pressures and temperatures . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] , it can be seen that the @xmath62 phase should develop into the oxide if the oxygen pressure is raised or if the temperature is lower than 160  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 270  k ) .",
    "such transitions , however , may be prevented or hindered by kinetics ( e.g. diffusion barriers ) since extensive mass transport is required to form the oxide .    at atmospheric pressure ( @xmath81  atm . ) , typical of that used in industry , the bulk oxide is calculated to be only stable up to around 350  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 460  k ) . from this point of view",
    ", it can be concluded that for industrial reactions which take place at considerably higher temperatures , di - silver oxide can not be the active phase .",
    "the @xmath62 surface - oxide phase , however , is stable in the temperature range of 350 - 530  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 460 - 640  k ) which coincides with that at which epoxidation of ethylene occurs .",
    "we therefore propose that such atomic o species are actuating the reaction .",
    "with regard to the catalytic reactions that take place at even higher temperatures , it can be seen that only very low coverages of chemisorbed o are stable up to 720  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 830  k ) ; o atoms adsorbed at under - coordinated surface ag atoms are up to 865  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 975  k ) ( see below ) .",
    "therefore these species could possibly play a role in these reactions .",
    "it is interesting to note that regardless of the pressure , fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] shows that the _ ordering _ of the stable phases is the same , so that the same phases should be observable at different pressures if the temperature is adjusted accordingly .",
    "this indicates a way to bridge the pressure gap , i.e. , by appropriate choice of the pressure and temperatures to stay within the same phase .",
    "however , it is clear that sometimes this will not be possible within reasonable times because of kinetic hindering for dissociation and sticking of o@xmath3 ( i.e. , delivery of sufficient concentrations of atomic oxygen to the surface ) , as well as to kinetic limitations for adequate atomic rearrangement .",
    "experimentally , it has been reported that a `` strongly bound '' oxygen species ( named o@xmath82 ) forms after high temperature ( @xmath12900  k ) and atmospheric pressure exposure of polycrystalline silver , as well as ag(111 ) , to an oxygen environment .",
    "@xcite temperature programmed desorption spectra show that o@xmath82 desorbs at around 900  k and it is proposed by the authors to be the active species for the dehydrogenation of methanol  @xcite where it diffuses to the surface from bulk sites . at the high temperature of @xmath12900  k in an oxygen atmosphere , silver reconstructs to form many ( 111 ) facets  @xcite at the surface and it is speculated that this means that oxygen diffusion takes place by a so - called `` substitutional diffusion mechanism '' which the authors argue has higher barriers than usual interstitial diffusion , and to give rise to the o@xmath3 desorption peak at the high temperature of 900  k. from our calculations , this picture is difficult to understand , in particular , how sufficient amounts of bulk - dissolved oxygen can be formed . from our theoretical study , we know that at lower coverage , oxygen will prefer to stay on the surface , instead of in the sub - surface or bulk region , and for high o concentrations , oxide - like structures are preferred .",
    "@xcite furthermore , our results showed that substitutional oxygen adsorption in the bulk ( i.e. , o on ag sites ) is energetically unfavorable .",
    "@xcite      the importance of steps and vacancies as active sites has been well documented , from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "@xcite in our previous studies we investigated the binding of oxygen atoms on surfaces with pre - existing vacancies .",
    "@xcite we found the binding energy is stronger than on the ( 111 ) terraces , e.g. , for 0.25  ml adsorbed in fcc sites on a @xmath83/ag(111 ) vacancy array the binding energy is 3.83  ev while it is 3.52  ev on the perfect terrace , at the same coverage .",
    "a similar behavior can be expected for adsorption at under - coordinated sites at step edges , as has been shown theoretically for oxygen at other transition metals , see e.g. refs .   and . to investigate the affect of pressure and temperature on the stability of such o species , we calculated the gibbs free energy of formation .",
    "we find that under atmospheric pressure , the o atoms are stable to around 770  k ( incl . corrections : 880  k ) on a @xmath84/ag(111 ) vacancy array , and even to 865  k ( incl .",
    "corrections : 975  k ) on a @xmath83/ag(111 ) vacancy array .",
    "the existence and concentration of these species , however , clearly depends on the number of defect sites at the surface . in view of the above",
    ", it could be speculated that the tpd signal of `` o@xmath82 '' is due not to substitutional diffusion of oxygen atoms from the bulk to the surface as proposed , but due to o atoms adsorbed at under - coordinated surface silver sites .      as mentioned in the introduction , in the literature",
    ", the existence of surface ag vacancies has been proposed to stabilize a molecular - like ozone ( o@xmath7 ) species , which has been suggested to be active for the partial oxidation of ethylene .  @xcite as reported in ref .  , we calculated the adsorption energy of such a species on ( @xmath85 and @xmath64 vacancy arrays , corresponding to oxygen coverages of 1/3 and 1  ml , respectively .",
    "we found that these species were energetically _",
    "unfavorable _ compared to the commensurate oxide - like structures described above . if , however , we assume that ag vacancies exist , i.e. , neglecting the energy cost to create the vacancy , then the _ binding energy _ is the most favorable of all for coverage 1  ml",
    ". we can estimate the concentration of such ag vacancies using our calculated values of the vacancy formation energy , together with an arrhenius type equation : for a @xmath64 vacancy array with a vacancy concentration of 1/3  ml , the formation energy is 0.53  ev ; it is 0.44  ev for a concentration of 0.25  ml , and 0.55  ev for a concentration of 0.11  ml .",
    "considering a temperature of 550  k , corresponding to that around which epoxidation of ethylene takes place , this implies a concentration of thermally induced surface vacancies of less than about @xmath86  ml , which is very small .",
    "furthermore , calculation of the _ free energy _ shows that this species is less stable than the others .",
    "our results thus do not support the molecular ozone - like species as playing an important role , but point to oxygen atoms of the thin @xmath62 surface - oxide as being the main species actuating epoxidation of ethylene .      as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] , our calculations predict that thick oxide - like films can form at ag(111 ) , but only for low temperatures [ e.g. , @xmath87350  k ( 460  k incl .",
    "corrections ) at atmospheric pressure ] . the extremely low sticking coefficient of o@xmath3 at ag(111 ) ,",
    "@xcite as well as the found low thermal stability of these structures , may hinder their formation .",
    "for example , at high temperatures at which diffusion of o ( or ag ) atoms can effectively occur , the material may become unstable . furthermore ,",
    "when using no@xmath3 to deliver o atoms to the surface , the substrate has to be held at temperatures _ higher _ than the temperature at which di - silver oxide decomposes , in order to desorb the no molecules .",
    "using , however , low temperatures and _ atomic oxygen _ or ozone ( which readily dissociates at the surface ) instead of o@xmath3 ( or no@xmath3 ) , we predict that thick oxide structures could be observed experimentally  providing that diffusion barriers can be overcome .",
    "interestingly , it was found that di - silver oxide ( ag@xmath3o ) can be prepared using a mixture of ozone and o@xmath13 or microwave generated atomic oxygen , at room temperature on _ polycrystalline _ silver foil .",
    "@xcite the oxygen generated in these processes is quite active , for example , small amounts of ozone ( 5 mol.@xmath66 o@xmath88 in o@xmath13 ) can generate the o partial pressure equivalent to that of a pure o@xmath3 atmosphere at 10@xmath89 atm . at a temperature of 465  k.  @xcite actually ,",
    "in these mixtures of reaction gas , ag@xmath13o can be stable to temperatures in excess of 773  k.  @xcite in the studies of waterhouse _ et .",
    "al . _ ,  @xcite it has been found that at room temperature , oxidation of polycrystalline silver foil is improved significantly after the sample has been `` scratched '' , which generates a high concentration of defects which act as the sites for the oxide film nucleation , highlighting the importance of defects .",
    "also diffusion of oxygen and silver atoms is seemingly improved significantly due to the non - uniformity of the growth .",
    "we note that subsequent to completion of our studies , very recent experimental work reported thick oxide formation at ag(111 ) by using a flux of atomic oxygen ,  @xcite thus supporting our findings .",
    "through density - functional theory calculations , and incorporating the effect of the atmospheric environment , we obtained the pressure - temperature phase diagram for the oxygen / ag(111 ) system , which reveals important insights into this system and its function as an oxidation catalyst : the calculations predict that a thin surface - oxide structure is most stable in the temperature and pressure range of ethylene epoxidation and we propose it ( and possibly other similar structures ) contains the main o species actuating the catalysis .",
    "low coverages of chemisorbed o become more stable for higher temperatures and could also play a role in other oxidation reactions .",
    "the only species stable for temperatures in excess of 720  k ( incl .",

    "thick bulk - like di - silver oxide can safely be ruled out as playing an important role in the technical catalytic reactions due to the low thermal stability , causing decomposition at temperatures lower than those used in the reactors .",
    "they are , however , the most stable structures for strongly o - rich conditions and low temperatures ( e.g. , up to 330 - 460  k at atmospheric pressure ) .",
    "interestingly , the electronic structure of thick oxide surfaces are very similar to that of the thin @xmath62 surface oxide structure , which raises the question of whether di - silver oxide might be used as a _ low - temperature _ oxidation catalyst .",
    "a molecular ozone - like species adsorbed at a surface vacancy , as had been proposed in the literature as being the active species for the epoxidation of ethylene , is energetically unfavorable , as is bulk - dissolved oxygen , which strongly questions the latters hitherto thought crucial role in , e.g. , the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde .",
    "we also studied the bulk and ( 111 ) surface properties of ag@xmath13o , the most stable silver oxide .",
    "the interaction of oxygen and silver is via a weak hybridization between ag-4@xmath57 - 5@xmath90 and o-2@xmath18 orbitals , with substantial occupation of antibonding orbitals , which explains its low stability .",
    "various terminations of the ag@xmath13o(111 ) surface were investigated as a function of the oxygen chemical potential and it is found that the surface with oxygen in the hollow site ( i.e. , the stoichiometric surface ) is most favorable for all of the range of the o chemical potential considered , while the ag - terminated surface and surfaces with additional oxygen adsorbed on top of exposed `` cus '' surface ag atoms are unfavorable . on investigating the energetics of a transition from commensurate oxide - like structures to the `` real '' ( unstrained ) oxide , we find that the transition becomes favorable only at nine o - ag - o trilayers , which corresponds to @xmath124.5  ml oxygen .",
    "the approach of `` _ ab initio _",
    "atomistic thermodynamics '' , i.e. , of calculating free energies for many possible atomic geometries and predicting the lowest energy structures in contact with species in a gas - phase environment , is a promising approach to investigate a system under different pressure and temperature conditions , in particular , from those of typical theoretical surface science , right up to those of technical heterogeneous catalysis .",
    "the obtained phase diagram also shows that if one stays within the region of one phase or along a phase boundary , then a bridging of the pressure gap should be possible .",
    "furthermore , it may be expected that the regions which lie close to the boundaries in the computed surface phase diagram may exhibit enhanced thermal fluctuations , i.e. , here the dynamics of atomistic processes may be particularly strong , and this may be particularly relevant for catalysis under realistic conditions .",
    "furthermore , we note however , that an understanding of a _ full catalytic cycle _ , requires a kinetic modeling that includes all reactant species and intermediates , which for complex systems such as those discussed in the present paper , is not yet possible .",
