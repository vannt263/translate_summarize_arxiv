    "monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) are two - dimensional materials composed of a layer of triangularly arranged transition metal atoms sandwiched between two layers of triangularly arranged chalcogenide atoms , forming a 2d honeycomb lattice similar to graphene but with broken sublattice symmetry @xcite . with their strong mechanical properties , relatively high electron mobility , and the massive dirac energy spectrum @xcite , monolayer tmds are considered potential materials for next generation transistors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , due to the breaking of in - plane mirror symmetry and the strong atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , electrons near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys are subject to strong effective zeeman fields @xcite as depicted in fig.1a .",
    "these effective zeeman fields strongly polarize electron spins to the out - of - plane directions and the spin polarizations are opposite at opposite valleys . to distinguish this special type of soc from 2d rashba soc which pins electron spins to in - plane directions , we refer to this effective zeeman field as ising soc field .    even though the normal states of monolayer tmds have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite ,",
    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of the superconducting monolayer tmds have only just started .",
    "it was first shown recently that gated mos@xmath2 thin films , with conducting electrons trapped in a single layer , exhibit superconductivity at about 10k with optimal gating @xcite .",
    "importantly , the in - plane upper critical field @xmath3 of the system can be several times larger than the pauli limit and an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath3 of bulk superconducting samples where inversion symmetry is restored @xcite . in recent experiments , monolayers of nbse@xmath2 have been successfully fabricated , which are superconducting @xcite and the in - plane @xmath3 exhibits strong enhancement similar to gated mos@xmath2 @xcite .     and @xmath1 valleys subject to the ising soc fields in opposite directions .",

    "the parameters of c ) and d ) are given in appendix b.,width=307 ]    as explained in refs.@xcite , the ising soc have opposite directions in opposite valleys so that it preserves time - reversal symmetry and is compatible with superconductivity . due to",
    "the strong pinning of electron spins to the out - of - plane directions by ising soc , external in - plane magnetic fields are much less effective in aligning electron spins . as a result , @xmath3 is strongly enhanced .",
    "we refer to this special type of non - centrosymmetric superconductor as ising superconductor @xcite .    in gated mos@xmath2 ,",
    "the experimental data are well explained by solving the self - consistent gap equation which includes the ising soc fields of about 100 t ( @xmath7 6 mev in zeeman energy ) @xcite . in nbse@xmath2 , the ising soc estimated is even larger at about 660 t due to the stronger soc in the hole bands @xcite .",
    "both of the estimations extracted from the mos@xmath2 and nbse@xmath2 experiments are consistent with the corresponding ising soc found from dft calculations @xcite .",
    "however , there are still important remaining questions : 1 ) besides the in - plane @xmath3 measurements , are there other ways to detect ising superconductivity ? 2 ) are there any novel experimental consequences of ising superconductivity ? this work is devoted to answering these two questions .    in the following sections , we show that the ising soc induces spin - triplet pairing correlations in an s - wave superconductor .",

    "half - metal leads with spin @xmath5 polarized to the in - plane directions can freely tunnel cooper pairs into the superconductor .",
    "the andreev reflection tunneling amplitude decreases as @xmath5 deviates from the in - plane directions .",
    "this would give an experimental signature of ising superconductivity as depicted in fig.2 .",
    "more importantly , when a half - metal wire is placed on top of the ising superconductor , spin - triplet pairing can be induced on the wire given that @xmath5 has in - plane components .",
    "this would result in a 1d topological superconductor , which supports majorana end states , as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "finally , the differences between ising soc and rashba soc are discussed .",
    "to be specific , we study the properties of ising superconductivity in monolayer mos@xmath2 but the conclusion obtained is very general and can be applied to many other superconducting tmd materials with ising soc . in the recent experiments , electrons of mos@xmath2 thin films",
    "are mostly trapped in the top layer due to heavy liquid gating .",
    "the samples exhibit superconductivity when the conduction bands near the @xmath0 valleys are filled and the @xmath8 is about 10k at optimal gating @xcite .",
    "the conduction bands near the @xmath0 points are predominantly originating from the mo @xmath9 orbitals of the triangularly arranged mo atoms @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian near the @xmath0 valleys , in the basis of @xmath10 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the momentum of the @xmath0 point , @xmath13 denotes the momentum deviated from @xmath0 or @xmath1 points and @xmath14 is the valley index .",

    "the superconducting mos@xmath2 with spin - singlet s - wave pairing potential @xmath17 can be described by the following mean field hamiltonian in the nambu basis @xmath18 : @xmath19 as demonstrated in the seminal works in refs.@xcite , the pairing symmetry of the cooper pairs can be found by solving the gorkov equations to obtain the pairing correlations .",

    "are strongly suppressed .",
    "since the cooper pairs in the ising superconductor have spin pointing to in - plane directions , the equal - spin andreev reflection amplitude is maximum when the spin polarization @xmath5 of the half - metal lead is parallel to the in - plane directions . as @xmath5 deviates from the in - plane directions , the andreev reflection tunneling amplitude decreases and becomes minimum when @xmath5 is perpendicular to the in - plane directions .",

    "this is due to the suppression of ordinary andreev reflection in the half - metal lead . when @xmath16 is finite , in - gap equal - spin andreev reflections are possible due to the triplet pairing correlations induced by the ising soc and the in - gap conductance is finite",
    "moreover , the conductance decreases when @xmath5 deviates from the in - plane direction ( @xmath40 ) and reaches the minimum when @xmath5 is perpendicular to the in - plane directions ( @xmath45 ) as expected .",

    "<S> in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) , electrons in opposite @xmath0 valleys are subject to opposite effective zeeman fields , which are referred to as ising spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) fields . </S>",
    "<S> the ising soc , originated from in - plane mirror symmetry breaking , pins the electron spins to the out - of - plane directions , and results in the newly discovered ising superconducting states with strongly enhanced upper critical fields . in this work , we show that the ising soc generates equal - spin triplet cooper pairs with spin polarized in the in - plane directions . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the spin - triplet cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half - metal wire placed on top of the tmd and result in a topological superconductor with majorana end states . </S>",
    "<S> direct ways to detect equal - spin triplet cooper pairs and the differences between ising superconductors and rashba superconductors are discussed . </S>"
