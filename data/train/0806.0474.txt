    "recently , the influence of the phonons interacting with an electronic two - level system via the deformation potential coupling was investigated in a gaas wire @xcite . here , we extend this analysis to include the interaction with phonons via the piezoelectric coupling which may be of particular relevance for wurtzite nanowires . in comparison with bulk modes which lead to continuous phonon side bands attached to the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) @xcite ,",
    "the interaction with wire phonons leads to a set of phonon side peaks .",
    "these reflect the multitude of phonon modes arising due to the spatial confinement in the lateral direction .",
    "in addition , while bulk phonons do not lead to a finite linewidth of the excitonic transition without resorting to higher order processes @xcite , the lowest ( acoustic ) wire phonon mode leads to a temperature dependent zpl broadening . in this paper , we focus on the piezoelectric interaction which can lead to additional absorption features as compared to the case of the deformation potential coupling due to different selection rules in the coupling mechanisms .",
