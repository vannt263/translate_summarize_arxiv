    "many physics majors are unaware of the important role that physicists play in medical research .",
    "typical coursework for a physics major is removed from real - world applications , especially compared to what they perceive for their pre - medical peers . as a result , some students question whether majoring in physics will allow them to pursue a useful and satisfying career .",
    "these students will benefit from participation in projects that make connections between physical concepts and real - world medical problems . in this paper",
    "we focus on the modeling of reentrant tachycardias as a means to introduce physics majors to the physical underpinnings of excitable tissues .",
    "the voltage changes that occur across cell membranes during action potentials ( the signal pulses ) in cardiac and neural tissues constitute an important type of excitable nonlinear behavior .",
    "excitable systems typically display a threshold - triggered fast - response positive feedback followed by a slow - response inhibition that causes the system to return to its resting values .",
    "the recovery includes a phase known as the refractory period during which additional excitation is either more difficult or impossible to elicit .",
    "excitation is manifested by the temporal pulse shape of a system variable such as the membrane potential during action potentials in cardiac and neuronal cells.@xcite another example at the cellular level is the calcium waves that occur inside cells during critical developmental events such as fertilization or changes in motility .",
    "slower examples include changes in population dynamics that occur during disease epidemics and the ignition of vegetation in forest fires .",
    "students can use theoretical and electronic excitable systems to explore the dynamics of these situations and test proposed control mechanisms such as cardiac defibrillation , vaccine intervention , and fire - fighting strategies . in this paper we model reentrant tachycardia responsible for atrial flutter , a common cardiac arrhythmia , and its treatment with surgical ablation ( destruction of the abnormal tissue ) .",
    "one approach is to start with a mathematically simple excitable system and then build its electronic circuit realization . for this approach",
    "we use the fitzhugh - nagumo equations.@xcite another approach is to start with a simple circuit that exhibits excitable behavior ; we use a three transistor excitable circuit .",

    "bunton et al.@xcite describe an excitable circuit based on comparators and multiplexer integrated circuits and review other circuit models .",

    "the projects described here are intended to introduce the behavior of excitable membranes and their actions in cardiac and neural systems .",
    "the projects also provide valuable applications of computational physics and circuit analysis and construction .    under normal conditions , action potentials that regulate heartbeat travel through the cardiac conduction system in a unidirectional fashion from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node , through the atrioventricular bundle of fibers and eventually through the purkinje fibers in the wall of the ventricles.@xcite this cardiac conduction system can malfunction and lead to a condition known as reentrant tachycardia , in which abnormally rapid heartbeats circulate through the conduction system without stopping .",
    "several types of medically important tachycardias exist .",
    "the behavioral effects include shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , heart palpitations , and chest pain .",

    "in neural and cardiac tissue the momentary excitation pulses of the membrane potential ( voltage difference from interior to exterior across the cell membrane ) , known as action potentials , are caused by ionic currents that flow through channels in the cell membrane .",
    "fast - response positive feedback arises from the increased conductance through sodium and/or calcium ion channels that allow those ions to flow into the cell , thereby depolarizing or reducing the membrane potential .",
    "( the resting membrane potential is negative , so an inward current depolarizes the membrane by raising the potential toward zero . ) in cardiac cells calcium ion currents cause the cardiac action potentials to have longer durations than most neuronal action potentials .",
    "the slow inhibitory response is caused by a delayed opening of potassium channels that allow those ions to flow out of the cell , thereby causing the recovery or repolarization ( hyperpolarization ) phase .",
    "a slowly responding decrease in the conductance of the sodium channels also adds to the recovery phase .",
    "the numbers and types of ion channels vary depending on the particular type of cell .",
    "the types of ion channels are distinguished by their voltage - gated threshold value , kinetics , and ion selectivities .",

    "the advantage of this model is its applicability to all situations for the transistor , from fully off with base voltage equal to emitter voltage , all the way to fully on ( saturation ) with the collector voltage nearly equal to emitter voltage .",
    "thus this transistor model covers both linear amplification and switching applications .",
    "we give a brief explanation of the model assuming familiarity with the basics of bipolar junction transistors .",

    "a voltage across one of the junctions causes current given by eq .  .",
    "the transport factor @xmath129 is the fraction of this current that diffuses across the base region thereby flowing through the second junction . in addition",
    ", the voltage across the second junction causes current at that junction given by eq .  .",
    "this current has an associated transport current at the first junction given by a transport factor for that direction of current flow .",
    "the result is that the transistor s collector and emitter currents each have two contributions , one similar to eq .   due to the junction voltage at that terminal and the other due to the transport current associated with the voltage at the other junction .",
    "the difference between the collector and emitter currents is accounted for by the base current .",
