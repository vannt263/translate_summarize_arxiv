    "during the last years , the interest in the utilization of porous media composed of fibers has been considerably increased , especially for energy conversion applications  @xcite .",
    "for instance , carbon papers and carbon felt are by now widely used as gas diffusion layers of fuel cells .",
    "but the rapid rise of decarbonized green energy demand does not limit the application of such materials to fuel cells .",
    "flow batteries have recently been perceived as one of the most promising technologies for electrochemical energy storage . even though flow batteries are known since the late 1980s , it is only during recent years that the scientific community has focused on improving their performance  @xcite . a cell of a flow battery",
    "is composed by two porous media fibrous electrodes .",
    "the inner surfaces of the porous media act as active site where electrochemical reduction and oxidation reactions of the electrolytes occur .",
    "both half - cells are supplied with the electrolyte solutions which are stored in external tanks and circulated by pumps to keep on the reactions .",
    "one limitation to the peak performance of flow batteries consists of the too slow electrolyte transport in the electrodes  @xcite .",
    "the fluid dynamic optimization of the porous medium which provides both the electrochemical active surfaces and the mixing volume of the chemical species is one of the main technological issues to be dealt with  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the slow dispersion process of species in water represents a bottleneck for the peak performance of flow batteries . specifically , the mass diffusion coefficients of the species in water , @xmath0 , are about 10000 smaller then the water kinematic viscosity , @xmath1 , indicating that the mass diffusion is 10000 times slower than the momentum transport .",
    "enhancing this diffusivity can produce a dramatic increase in the cell performance .",
    "a proper designed geometry of a non - isotropic porous medium can enhance this effective mass transport while minimizing the drag , thus improving and optimizing the batteries performances.@xcite .",
    "the present study deals with such analyses , by means of a lattice boltzmann model and a lagrangian particle tracking algorithm .    even if the influence of medium porosity on the flow drag has been largely studied  @xcite , the impact of its microscopic design on the combined mixing / transport mechanisms and drag is still not well assessed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , even though the anomalous ( i.e.  non - fickian ) behavior of dispersion in porous media has been widely investigated  @xcite , it is not clear to what extent the micro - structure of the medium can impact macroscopic dispersion phenomena .",
    "local heterogeneities at various scales have been considered capable of generating such anomalous behavior  @xcite .",
    "berkowitz and sher  @xcite claimed that a wide distribution of delay times limiting the transport in porous media results in non - fickian dispersion which can not be represented by an equation including a time - dependent dispersion coefficient .",
    "instead , the authors highlighted that all the time evolution of motion must be taken into account , and that the macroscopic advection - dispersion equation ( ade ) must be non - local in time .",
    "whitaker  @xcite identified different fluid - dynamic variables responsible for the dispersion by means of the volume averaging technique .",
    "this analysis revealed the presence of different terms in the averaged ade which act as sources of dispersion and convection .",
    "nevertheless , the volume averaging technique is not sufficient to predict the dispersion behavior in a general way , since the evaluation of the effective dispersion tensor is limited by some constraints .",
    "in fact , in practical applications the value of the effective dispersion tensor may be significantly different than expected , since it depends on the unconditioned statistics of hydraulic permeabilities of the porous medium  @xcite .",
    "several authors agree that dispersion should tend to the standard fickian dispersion at a certain temporal or length scale for which all the hypothesis of the central limit theorem are satisfied , i.e.  when the particle motion is no more correlated  @xcite .",
    "such transient anomalous behavior has been recently recognized in a variety of physical - chemical and socio - economical systems , which can also present non - gaussian yet fickian dispersion behaviors  @xcite . however , the aforementioned time or length scales strongly depend on the medium structure and , thus , they are not easy to determine a priori .",
    "more recently , other causes have been identified as responsible of the anomalous dispersion , such as the presence of three - dimensional vortices  @xcite , particle jumps  @xcite and different mechanisms of dispersion acting on subgroups of particles  @xcite .",
    "castiglione et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that two mechanisms of dispersion ( i.e.  a weak anomalous dispersion and a strong anomalous dispersion associated to ballistic motion ) can give rise to transient anomalous dispersion in several systems .",
    "the authors underlined that even though it is not particularly difficult to build up probabilistic models exhibiting anomalous dispersion , understanding anomalous dispersion in nontrivial systems , such as porous media , is much more difficult  @xcite .    a review of the literature about anomalous dispersion revealed that this behavior is really difficult to predict .",
    "furthermore , to the best of these authors knowledge , a good understanding of how porous medium micro - structure can enhance macroscopic transport is still lacking , especially for fibrous porous media . many works on such media have been focused on the geometrical properties which can possibly affect standard fickian dispersion and reaction , rather than on the intrinsic behavior of dispersion phenomena  @xcite .    in order to clarify this issue",
    ", this study presents results of several simulations at different preferential orientation of fibers , porosity and reynolds number . a lattice - boltzmann - based model coupled with a lagrangian particle tracking algorithm has been used .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to clarify how the nematic properties of the porous medium affects the mass and momentum transport mechanisms in order to design optimal porous media with low drag and high effective mass diffusion .",
    "the minimization of drag reduces the pump power demand , while the maximization of the mixing improves the homogeneity of reacting species all along the porous medium , both effects enhancing the performance of flow batteries .",
    "it will be shown , that porous media constituted by fibers preferentially oriented along the flow direction exhibit smaller drag and higher effective diffusion .",
    "during recent years the lattice - boltzmann method ( lbm ) has gained much attention as alternative solution to the navier - stokes equations  @xcite . due to its numerical efficiency , easy parallelization and capability of handling complex geometries , the lbm is a promising tool to simulate complex flow fields at low reynolds number , such as flows through fibrous electrodes for flow batteries . in the present study a three - dimensional d3q19 lattice - boltzmann multi - relaxation time",

    "the mrt scheme allows to overcome some drawbacks of the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) formulation , which is the simplest and most common lattice - boltzmann equation , such as the viscosity - dependent numerical errors , especially in the case of very complex geometries  @xcite . in order to simulate a pressure gradient @xmath2 in the flow",

    "eq.([lbmmrt ] ) is a discrete formulation of the boltzmann transport equation and states the relation between the collision step ( right - hand of the equation ) and the streaming step ( left - hand of the equation ) .",
    "the set of moments @xmath12 consists of the hydrodynamic moments , which are conserved during collision , e.g. mass and momentum , and the non - conserved moments . in order to recover the correct navier - stokes equation and avoid discrete lattice effects ,",
    "the body force @xmath14 has been added during the collision step as follows  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the weight of the lbm scheme along the @xmath5-th lattice direction and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the eulerian component of the discrete speed , velocity , and pressure gradient , along the directions @xmath20 .",

    "in light of this , further simulations have been carried out in order to characterize the effective dispersion induced by the porous medium micro - structure with high porosity values ; the fiber reynolds number has been fixed in the order of @xmath41 and the porosity at @xmath42 , in order to minimize drag .    a triperiodic box has been considered , see fig .

    "this approach allows to determine the statistical confidence on the data .",
    "the bulk resistance to the flow induced by fibrous media with different typical fiber orientation is characterized by the permeability @xmath52 described in eq .  .",

    "this behavior is not surprising considering that the former case presents the lowest projected area of the fibers on the cross - stream plane , while the latter the highest . in particular",

    "the analysis has been restricted to non - brownian particles whose trajectories coincide with those of fluid particles . as previously noted , the typical diffusion coefficient of electrolytes is quite small ( @xmath65 ) and usually negligible on the scale of the porous electrode .",
    "the main dispersion properties have been evaluated using the ( dimensionless ) mean square displacements in the streamwise ( @xmath66 ) and transverse ( @xmath67 ) directions evaluated from the statistics of particle displacements @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the characteristic time , @xmath71 is the displacement along a generic direction @xmath32 , @xmath72 is the displacement fluctuation , and @xmath73 indicates the ensemble averaging operator .",

    "these different behaviors identifies three main regimes : ( i ) a typical ballistic dispersion for short times , ( ii ) a superdiffusive dispersion for intermediate times , and ( iii ) a third regime for long times which is fickian in the transverse direction , while still superdiffusive for the streamwise direction .",
    "the hydraulic diameter @xmath82 has been related to the mean intercept length in porous media  @xcite .",
    "more to the point , it indicates the mean width of the pores formed by the porous micro - structure . in order to take into account the effect of the fibers orientation , one should consider the main pores width and length along the streamwise @xmath32 direction , that is , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , see fig  [ fig4 ] . following this approach the mean half - width of the pores ( i.e.  the main radius of the pores ) and their mean length result @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the transverse oriented , isotropic and streamwise oriented medium , respectively . in the light of this",

    "it should be noted that different exponents of the time behavior in @xmath54 have been reported in the literature , considering different porous media , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the present data , showing long - time superdiffusive streamwise dispersion , are consistent with the recent findings of kang et al .",
    "@xcite who analyzed a numerical simulation of a real porous geometry reconstructed by a micro - tomography . concerning the difference among the three cases considered which differ for the fiber orientation ,",
    "a very similar trend for the dispersion in the streamwise direction for all cases has been noted .",
    "however for the long time behavior , the transition from the superdiffusive dispersion with @xmath96 to that with @xmath97 occurs at shorter times for the isotropic and the preferentially transverse cases so the particles of the preferentially streamwise aligned medium show eventually a slightly larger @xmath66 for high @xmath74 .",
    "concerning the differences found in the transverse dispersion , in the ballistic short - time behavior , the transverse medium shows higher rate of dispersion , followed by the isotropic case and then the streamwise oriented one . in this limit , @xmath98 , so that @xmath75 ballistic dispersion is imposed by the fluid cross - stream velocity fluctuation levels which are maximal in the transverse case ( tab .",
    "[ tab ] ) .",
    "after the ballistic motion , all the cases show a similar time scale with transition to the super - diffusive behavior .",
    "however , the streamwise oriented medium shows a slightly longer transition time .",
    "a similar trend is shown for the second transition from the super - diffusive to the regular fickian behavior , where again the streamwise oriented medium shows the longest transition time .",
    "the longer permanence time of this case in the ballistic and super - diffusive behaviors allows a recovery of the slower dispersion shown for small @xmath74 . for this reason ,",
    "all cases show a similar level of @xmath67 for long time , when they exhibit a fickian diffusion in the transverse direction .",
    "the porous structures created by the streamwise oriented direction , which is possibly able to correlate the motion of a fraction of particles for a much longer time , provides a possible explanation .",
    "dimensionless mean square displacement against dimensionless time @xmath74 along the streamwise ( @xmath99 , dashed lines ) and transverse ( @xmath100 , solid lines ) directions .",
    "three main regimes can be distinguished : 1 ) a ballistic dispersion for short times ; 2 ) a superdiffusive dispersion for intermediate times ; 3 ) a still superdiffusive dispersion along the streamwise direction and a fickian standard dispersion along the transverse direction , i.e.  @xmath101 , for long times .",
    "the difference in the three main regimes is highlighted in the inset which shows the ratio @xmath102 approaching a constant value in the second and third regime along the transverse and streamwise direction , respectively . ]    to this purpose , it is important to analyze the correlations of the particle motion in order to understand the different behaviors .",
    "the dimensionless autocorrelation functions @xmath103 along the streamwise and transverse directions have been determined as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the particle absolute and fluctuation velocities along the direction @xmath20 .",
    "results of dimensionless autocorrelation functions @xmath103 for different fiber orientations are plotted against the characteristic time @xmath74 in fig .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation @xmath107 along the streamwise direction is significantly higher than the transverse one for all the considered cases .",
    "moreover , for long times , the streamwise velocity autocorrelation slowly decays , while that for the transverse direction decorrelates for @xmath108 .",
    "this behavior reflects the anisotropy induced by the mean flow driven by the mean pressure gradient .",
    "the correlation of the streamwise motion for longer times is attributed to two typical particle trajectories , the former to the particle that travels near a stagnation point , the latter to particles which flow in the bulk of some almost streamwise aligned long pores . in both cases the particles tend to reside for long time in the same state characterized by a similar velocity . before discussing the effect of the preferential fiber alignment , it is interesting to note how different is the autocorrelation of the transverse velocity .",
    "it shows a faster decorrelation and shows a negative minimum around @xmath109 , which approximately corresponds to the mean half - width of pores in the medium @xmath110 .",
    "this minimum indicates that after that time , the particle motion tend to reverse in the transverse direction and this can be interpreted as an effect induced by the particles which are rounding the fibers . actually after the minimum , the autocorrelation shows a relative maximum before decorrelating , which can be interpreted as the effect of a successive fiber encountered during the motion . concerning the effect of the preferential fiber orientation , the autocorrelation of the preferentially streamwise oriented fibers is in general higher for longer times for both the streamwise and transversal motions . in some sense",
    ", it appears that the pores created by the almost streamwise fiber are able to be followed by a part of particles for longer times .",
    "this induces a higher correlation for both velocities , since the pores are not completely streamwise oriented along the weakly tilted fibers .",
    "this results in longer characteristic times which divides the typical dispersion behaviors observed in the @xmath54 .",
    "as it is well known , the mean square displacement is actually determined by the autocorrelation function as , @xmath111    from eq.([msdac ] ) , the ballistic behavior @xmath112 can be obtained for @xmath113 , while for high @xmath74 and @xmath114 the dispersion becomes regular and brownian , namely @xmath115 .",
    "if instead for long times it is @xmath116 , the mean square displacement shows an anomalous diffusion , @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "hence , the different dynamics noted in the @xmath54 analysis reflects in different behaviors of the autocorrelation .",
    "it has been previously noticed how the preferentially streamwise oriented medium shows longer characteristic times for the transition among the different dynamics and that this reflects in higher dispersion at longer times .",
    "moreover , the long time behavior observed for the mean square displacement is consistent with the results of the autocorrelation where a decorrelation is found for the transverse velocity and a slow decay with @xmath119 is observed for the streamwise direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "dimensionless velocity autocorrelation @xmath120 against dimensionless time @xmath74 along the streamwise ( @xmath121 , dashed lines ) and transverse ( @xmath122 , solid lines ) directions .",
    "the autocorrelation approaches zero along the transverse direction for long characteristic times , i.e.  in the third regime observed .",
    "the figure highlights that the streamwise - oriented medium presents higher velocity autocorrelations not only along the streamwise direction ( as expected since fibers are aligned with the main flow ) , but also in the transverse direction .",

    "to better highlight the origin of the different anomalous dispersion behaviors , the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of the particle displacements along the streamwise and transverse directions are shown in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "the displacements are relative to the mean position and normalized with the square root of the variance ( @xmath54 ) in order to highlight the difference with the corresponding gaussian distribution . at @xmath126 and for small @xmath74",
    "the pdf of the displacements correspond to that of the flow field @xmath127 , since the particle motion is highly correlated with their initial conditions . focusing on the streamwise behavior first ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] panel a ) , the displacements and the underlying velocity field is strongly non - gaussian . the mean flow direction induces a highly asymmetric pdf with a steep positive tail .",
    "in particular the streamwise velocity field is characterized by low - velocity regions ( near stagnation points ) and by high - velocity preferential paths which correspond to long pores mainly oriented along the streamwise direction .",
    "this behavior induces a great asymmetry of the displacement at small times with a pdf which is left - truncated and reveals a significant part of particles traveling at speed far higher than the average ( right tail of the pdf ) . since at @xmath128 the streamwise motion is still correlated ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the pdf is very similar to the initial one .",
    "after a characteristic time @xmath129 , which identifies the end of the ballistic motion with a power - law decaying correlation , the shape of the pdf starts to approach the gaussian shape , see panels @xmath130 and @xmath131 of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , with still a positive tail slightly steeper than a gaussian .",
    "no significant differences emerge from pdfs of different media .",
    "the origin of the streamwise anomalous diffusion appears related to the skewed non - gaussian intermittent flow velocity field induced by the fibrous microstructure .",

    "nonetheless , when @xmath148 the corresponding eulerian transport equation consists of nontrivial fractional derivatives  @xcite . in order to overcome this issue at the practical aim",
    ", it is convenient to transform the superdiffusive dispersion process in an equivalent regular dispersion process so as to solve a usual convection - diffusion - reaction equation for the eulerian homogenized mass transport .",
    "however , in order to define an equivalent gaussian system it is necessary to fix a typical displacement length @xmath149 that characterizes the typical size of the system where the anomalous dispersion process occurs .",
    "the equivalent system is then obtained matching the actual mean square displacements calculated at the system size , i.e.  @xmath150 , with the equivalent normal diffusion process characterized by @xmath142 .",
    "the effective mass diffusivity has thus been derived by imposing the following equality : @xmath151 from which it follows : @xmath152    figure [ fig9 ] well depicts the effect of fibers orientation on the streamwise and transverse dispersion .",
    "values of @xmath142 are plotted against the mean value of @xmath62 .",
    "while no significant differences on the dispersion coefficient are observed along the transverse direction , an increment of dispersion can be achieved along the streamwise direction by choosing to align fibers preferentially along the streamwise direction .",
    "being the process superdiffusive , the larger the typical system scale , the higher the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "e.g.  considering the typical streamwise extension of the system in the order of 1000 fiber diameters , the effective diffusion coefficient becomes 100 times larger than that in the transversal direction .",
    "it should be remarked that the medium with fibers aligned along the flow exhibits the lowest resistance to the flow , i.e.  the highest permeability . at practical purposes ,",
    "it is crucial to define an efficiency in terms of ratio between energy spent to drive the flow and mixing achieved in the porous medium .",
    "this efficiency as a function of the preferential orientation of the fibers in the medium can be expressed as an effective schmidt number @xmath153 which corresponds to the ratio between the effective viscosity and diffusion coefficients : @xmath154    the values of effective schmidt numbers has been reported in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] which highlights the dispersion efficiency of the differently oriented media .",
    "the lower the schmidt number , the lower the ratio between the effective viscosity and the effective dispersion . in other words ,",
    "low schmidt numbers indicate low drag and high dispersion , which in turn increases the electrodes performances .",
    "the values of @xmath153 have been evaluated for the same pressure gradient @xmath2 rather than for the same @xmath61 , since the same pressure gradient imposes slightly different reynolds numbers ( tab .  [ tab ] ) .",
    "this is useful for practical applications since the main tunable parameter in real flow batteries systems is @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the effective schmidt number indicates how much efficient is the dispersion in the fibrous medium , at a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath153 number depends on the fiber reynolds number since the dimensionless effective viscosity @xmath53 is inversely proportional to it , while the dimensionless diffusion coefficient @xmath142 is independent of it . from a theoretical point of view , it is interesting to note that the effective peclet number @xmath155 defined as , @xmath156 gets rid of the dependence on the fiber reynolds number since for viscous flow in porous media the dimensionless permeability is independent of the reynolds number .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] depicts values of the effective peclet number .",
    "this indicator shows an increase of dispersion efficiency less pronounced but still remarkable .",
    "the behavior of the schmidt and peclet numbers unequivocally show that fibrous media preferentially oriented along the streamwise direction are characterized by higher effective mixing with the lowest pressure loss and appear the optimal configuration for porous electrodes for rfbs .",
    "schmidt number @xmath153 plotted against the mean value of @xmath62 .",
    "both along the streamwise and transverse directions the medium preferentially oriented along the streamwise direction @xmath32 presents the lower value of schmidt number @xmath157 and , consequently , the highest dispersion efficiency . ]",
    "peclet number @xmath155 plotted against the mean value of @xmath62 .",
    "both along the streamwise and transverse directions the medium preferentially oriented along the streamwise direction @xmath32 presents the lowest value of peclet number . ]",
    "in the present study , the effects of altering the micro - structure of a porous medium composed of fibers have been quantified in terms of permeability and effective dispersion features . in particular ,",
    "the effect of the fiber orientation has been found to play a major pivotal role not only in the momentum transport behavior across the medium , but even in the dispersion dynamics .",
    "these results are crucial to optimize the fibrous electrodes of redox - flow - batteries .",
    "microscale modeling of viscous flows through differently oriented fibrous media have been performed by means of a numerical algorithm based on the lattice - boltzmann method .",
    "three main categories of fibrous media have been considered : isotropic and preferentially aligned and transversal with the bulk flow .",
    "the evolution of passive tracer particles dispersed in the flow has been obtained using a lagrangian particle tracking algorithm .",
    "results show that , as expected , the permeability value of the medium @xmath52 is increased by preferentially aligning the fibers along the streamwise direction so the overall drag exerted on the flow is diminished .",
    "the opposite behavior is observed for the media with fibers transverse to the flow .",
    "the mean square displacement @xmath54 of tracers show different anomalous and regular dispersion behaviors both along the streamwise and transverse directions .",
    "three different regimes have been identified : ( i ) a ballistic dispersion for very short characteristic times , ( ii ) a superdiffusive dispersion for intermediate characteristic times and ( iii ) a still superdiffusive dispersion and a standard fickian dispersion along the streamwise and transverse directions , respectively , for long characteristic times .",
    "the effect of fiber orientation on the dispersion dynamics has found to be less pronounced in comparison to that on momentum transport .",
    "nevertheless , the medium with fibers preferentially oriented along the streamwise direction shows slightly higher dispersion along both directions .",
    "this behavior has been ascribed to the capability of the latter medium to create pores which could be followed by tracers for longer time in comparison with the isotropic case , since the observed characteristic times of the autocorrelation functions are longer .",
    "actually , for energy storage applications , such as flow - batteries , the optimal medium should presents both low drag and high dispersion features .",
    "therefore , the values of the effective schmidt and peclet numbers which characterize the dispersion efficiency have been determined .",
    "the schmidt numbers give the ratio between the effective diffusion and the overall drag , but depends on the fiber reynolds number .",
    "the peclet number is instead independent of it .",
    "results clearly show the higher efficiency that can be achieved by aligning the fibers preferentially along the streamwise direction . in particular , by adopting this strategy , one can increase approximately the dispersion efficiency of 60% and 45% along the streamwise and transverse directions , respectively , in terms of schmidt number , and of 40% and 25% along the streamwise and transverse directions , respectively , in terms of peclet number , in comparison with an isotropic medium .",
    "these numbers can be seen as the fluid mechanics efficiency .",
    "for the sake of completeness , it can be shown that the dimensional effective dispersion coefficients @xmath158 $ ] , evaluated from the calculated dimensionless values @xmath142 , overwhelm the molecular diffusion coefficients when real electrodes are considered . with regards to all - vanadium redox flow batteries ,",
    "the kinematic viscosity and the typical fiber diameter are @xmath159 $ ] and @xmath160 $ ] , respectively , whereas the value of typical displacement length @xmath161 is of the order of centimeters along the streamwise directions , so that @xmath162  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion coefficients can be thus evaluated as @xmath163 . along the flow direction",
    "the dispersion coefficients are @xmath164 $ ] and @xmath165 $ ] , for the isotropic and the preferentially streamwise - oriented medium , whereas along the transverse direction they result @xmath166 $ ] and @xmath167 $ ] , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the typical molecular diffusion coefficient of vanadium ions in water is of the order of @xmath168 $ ] so several order of magnitude smaller than the effective diffusion coefficient promoted by the micro - structure of porous media .",
    "the results also show that the widely used bruggeman correction  * ? ? ?",
    "* to account for the effect of the porosity on the molecular diffusion , @xmath169 , is negligible for the dispersion of electrolytes in water being @xmath170.$ ] , so the @xmath171 provides a useful estimate of the effective diffusion being larger than the pore scale induced effective diffusion . ]",
    "these considerations highlight the major role of the fibrous medium in the enhancement of mixing in liquids .",
    "finally , the present findings on the effective diffusion can be directly applied to numerically solve advection - dispersion - reaction macroscopic equations for the species flowing in real fibrous media , in order to design optimal electrodes .",
    "in order to investigate the possible effects of inertia on dispersion dynamics at finite reynolds number , simulations of flows through isotropic fibrous media have been performed at higher @xmath172 number .",
    "interestingly , no significant differences have been found by increasing the reynolds number up to @xmath173 which can be considered an upper bound for redox flow battery applications .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows a comparison between the mean square displacements at @xmath174 and at @xmath175 , with the two curves overlapping almost perfectly .",
    "since the reynolds number range for the present application is @xmath176 , it can be concluded that the dispersion dynamics on flow batteries does not depend on the reynolds number and consequently inertial effects are negligible .",
