    "recently five - dimensional ( 5d ) supergravity ( sugra ) on the orbifold @xmath1 has been studied as an interesting theoretical framework for physics beyond the sm .",
    "it has been noted that 5d orbifold sugra with a @xmath0 symmetry gauged by the @xmath2-odd graviphoton can provide the supersymmetric randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite in which the weak to planck scale hierarchy can arise naturally from the geometric localization of 4d graviton  @xcite , and/or yukawa hierarchy can be generated by the quasi - localization of the matter zero modes in extra dimension where we generically have an interesting correlation between the flavor structure in the sparticle spectra and the hierarchical yukawa couplings  @xcite . in the former case , the bulk cosmological constant and brane tensions which are required to generate the necessary ads@xmath4 geometry appear in the lagrangian as a consequence of the @xmath0 fi term with @xmath2-odd coefficient .    in this",
    "talk we consider a more generic orbifold sugra which contains a @xmath2-even 5d gauge field @xmath5 participating in the @xmath0 gauging  @xcite .",
    "if 4d @xmath6 susy is preserved by the compactification , the 4d effective theory of such model will contain a gauged @xmath0 symmetry associated with the zero mode of @xmath5 , which is not the case when the 5d @xmath0 is gauged only through the @xmath2-odd graviphoton .",
    "based on the known off - shell formulation  @xcite , we formulate a gauged @xmath0 sugra on @xmath1 in which both @xmath5 and the graviphoton take part in the @xmath0 gauging and then analyze the structure of fi terms allowed in such model . as expected , introducing a @xmath2-even @xmath0 gauge field accompanies new bulk and boundary fi terms in addition to the known integrable boundary fi term which could be present in the absence of any gauged @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite . as we will see , those new fi terms can have interesting implications to the quasi - localization of the matter zero modes in extra dimension and the susy breaking  @xcite and also to the radion stabilization .",
    "for a minimal setup , we introduce two vector multiplets and two hypermultiplets in the off - shell formulation of 5d ( conformal ) sugra  @xcite : @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the norm function @xmath9 and the hypermultiplet gauging @xmath10 where we adopt the @xmath11 matrix notations omitting @xmath12 index and @xmath13 indices @xmath14 , and the hyperscalars satisfy the reality condition @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath2-even bosonic ( non - auxiliary ) components are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the graviphoton vector multiplet and the compensator hypermultiplet respectively . the @xmath2-odd coefficient @xmath24 in the hypermultiplet gauging is consistently introduced by the mechanism proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the nonzero value of the charge @xmath25 corresponds to the @xmath0 symmetry gauged by @xmath2-even vector field @xmath19 .",

    "the real and diagonal component of the quaternionic hyperscalar field @xmath46 is represented by @xmath47 in the killing parameters , and zero vacuum values are assumed for the other components for simplicity . in terms of these killing parameters ,",
    "the 4d energy density is found to be @xmath48 and it is obvious that the killing condition @xmath49 determines a stationary point of the 4d scalar potential if the solution exists .",
    "now we examine some physical consequences of the 5d gauged @xmath0 supergravity on @xmath1 which can have the bulk and the boundary fi term , for the supersymmetric vacuum configurations , @xmath49 .",
    "first we consider the case that we have a charged hypermultiplet @xmath46 with the charge satisfying @xmath50 . for @xmath51 that results in @xmath52 ,",

    "notice that the vacuum value of the gauge scalar @xmath60 gives the @xmath59-dependent mass for the charged hypermultiplets which results in nontrivial zero - mode wavefunctions for them .",
    "we will show the zero - mode profile in the next more simple but interesting case .",
    "next we consider the case there are charged chiral multiplets @xmath61 with the charge @xmath62 at the orbifold fixed points @xmath63 respectively , but no hypermultiplets with the charge @xmath50 in bulk .",
    "we introduce minimal khler potential and no superpotential for them at the fixed points . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the vacuum values of the scalar fields are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "we find a linear profile of @xmath41 in the @xmath59-direction due to the bulk fi term , which results in the gaussian form of the zero - mode wavefunction for the charged hypermultiplet , @xmath66 the ratio of the wavefunction values between two fixed points are then shown to be @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath68 but @xmath69 and in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for both @xmath70 . from these figures",
    "we find that the nonvanishing @xmath25 ( i.e. , gauging @xmath0 by @xmath2-even vector field ) as well as the bare kink mass @xmath71 affects the zero - mode profiles of the charged hypermultiplets significantly . the nonvanishing charge @xmath72 changes the linear profile of @xmath41 resulting in a more / less severe localization of the charged hypermultiplet zero - mode , depending on the sign of @xmath73 .",
