    "polymer brushes have been the subject of intense investigations starting from the seminal paper by alexander roughly 40 years ago @xcite . as surface modifiers , they have applications in various fields , e.g. , as anti - fouling surfaces @xcite , lubrication @xcite , biomedicine @xcite , @xcite , nanosensoring @xcite and others . the current level of understanding of brushes",
    "is to a large extent based on a relatively simple but detailed analytical theory , which was proposed at an early stage @xcite .",
    "although the original theory described only equilibrium properties of monodisperse brushes , it gave an impetus for a large body of experimental and simulation - based work extending well outside this scope ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "as far as the brush density profiles and detailed characteristics of brush - forming chains are concerned , the picture provided by theory and simulations for various chain lengths , grafting densities and solvent qualities is extremely detailed .",
    "thermodynamic parameters such as the chemical potential and the osmotic pressure profiles are also readily available @xcite .",
    "the experimental synthesis of monodisperse brushes ( or brushes with a very narrow molar mass distribution ) requires special methods .",
    "polymer brushes formed by long chains are typically produced using `` grafting to '' and `` grafting from '' techniques . in the `` grafting to '' technique ,",
    "narrowly fractioned pre - formed polymer chains of a given number - averaged chain length @xmath0 are tethered to a surface either by chemical bonding or by strong adsorption of a short sticky block .",
    "the number of grafted chains per unit area , @xmath1 , can be calculated from the total mass of grafted material and the total area , both directly measurable in the experiment . during the brush synthesis",
    ", polymer molecules must diffuse through an existing grafted polymer layer to reach the reactive sites decorating the surface .",
    "due to steric hindrance , this becomes increasingly difficult with increasing height and density of the polymer brush .",
    "hence only synthesize brushes with relatively low grafting densities and moderate brush thickness can be synthesized with this technique .",
    "the `` grafting from '' approach has become the preferred option for the synthesis of dense polymer brushes .",
    "this approach uses a surface immobilized initiator layer and subsequent in situ polymerization to generate the polymer brush .",
    "the method gives a polydisperse brush with higher grafting density @xmath1 independent of the polymerization time .",
    "in contrast to the `` grafting to '' methodology , calculating @xmath1 for systems prepared by the  grafting from \" approach is more challenging because @xmath10 is unknown a priori .",
    "one method of characterizing the chain length distribution ( or the molecular weight distribution ) is to degraft the polymer chains from a large surface area and collect a sufficient amount of material , which is then analyzed using a sensitive analytical method of size exclusion chromatography .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the chain length distribution of the degrafted chains of poly(methyl - methacrylate ) is close to the so - called schulz - zimm distribution .",
    "the values of the polydispersity index , @xmath11 , were marginally higher than those typically observed for bulk polymers grown under similar conditions and did not reveal any significant dependence on the polymerization time .",
    "( here @xmath12 denotes the weight averaged chain length which can be determined experimentally , e.g. , by scattering methods ) .",
    "thus the experimental techniques available for producing polymer brushes with high polymerization index typically yield rather broad chain length distributions .",
    "broad distributions are also typical for biological brushes covering the surface of some cells or blood vessels @xcite .",
    "it is common wisdom that polydispersity may significantly affect the properties of polymeric systems .",
    "however , experimental work comparing the properties of polymer brushes that differ only in polydispersity is still very rare . in ref .",
    "@xcite , curves showing the energy vs. separation upon bringing together two brush - coated surfaces were compared for brushes with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and similar values for the number - averaged molar mass @xmath15 and the grafting density @xmath16 .",
    "russell and co - workers @xcite observed that surfaces with a quaternary ammonia - modified dry polydisperse brush could kill bacteria cells , while a polymer brush of the same thickness but with low polydispersity could not penetrate the bacterial cell envelope ( the charge density is a critical parameter for the killing efficacy ) .",
    "polydispersity should also affect the penetration of polymer brushes by proteins .",
    "in particular , differences in the fouling properties of brushes were attributed to indirect polydispersity effects although no clear - cut experimental evidence was given @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the study of polydispersity effects on the structure and properties of brushes is quite difficult . a general approach based on the self - consistent field ( scf ) theory in the strong - stretching limit",
    "was proposed by milner , witten , and cates ( mwc ) @xcite .",
    "it allows to calculate the brush density profile as well as individual chain stretching characteristics numerically for a given chain length distribution .",
    "closed - form analytical expressions for the density profiles are typically not available , although some global brush characteristics are given in a simple integral form .",
    "intriguingly , almost none of the predictions have been compared to numerical scf work or simulations .",
    "at least part of the problem seems to be psychological , since the variety of conceivable chain length distribution functions is overwhelming .",
    "whether the strong stretching approximation which proved to be so useful in the case of monodisperse brushes is practical for broad chain length distributions remains an open question .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of polydisperse brushes face the additional challenge that one must perform quenched disorder averages , due to the fact that chains of different length are permanently grafted to a substrate .",
    "an extensive numerical scf study of polydispersity effects on the brush structure was presented in @xcite on the basis of the schulz - zimm distribution , which is commonly used to describe experimental samples . with this choice of distribution shape ,",
    "the polydispersity parameter @xmath3 can be tuned in a range from 1 to 2 .",
    "brush density profiles for moderate grafting density and good solvent conditions were calculated , allowing to study systematic changes in the brush height and in the profile shape with increasing polydispersity .",
    "qualitatively , the picture can be summarized as follows : starting from the familiar parabolic ( convex cap - like ) profile in the purely monodisperse case , the mean curvature of the profile decreases monotonically , resulting in clearly concave shapes at @xmath17 . in the case of moderate polydispersity , @xmath18 ,",
    "the density profile is almost linear .",
    "another paper by the same group addressed the polydispersity effects on the brush penetration by nanoparticles using scf calculations @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the larger the polydispersity , the easier it is for a small particle to penetrate the brush and to touch the substrate .",
    "for very large particles an opposite effect is found : it is harder to compress a polydisperse brush than a corresponding monodisperse brush .    in the present paper",
    "we study three cases representing vanishingly small , moderate and large polydispersity . by combining closed - form analytical solutions based on the mwc theory with a green s function approach",
    "we calculate the density profiles and the individual chain conformations ( including the chain fluctuations neglected by the strong stretching approximation ) and test the theory predictions by mc simulations and one - dimensional scf numerics .",
    "finally , we examine the effect of polydisperse brushes on hydrodynamical shear flow and calculate in particular the hydrodynamic penetration depth .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] describes the model system , the mc scheme , and the schulz - zimm distribution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : height ] , we discuss general characteristics of polydisperse brushes , such as their height and their density profiles . in sec.[sec : theory_tools ] , we briefly summarize the main predictions of the analytical theory ( which are derived in detail in appendix [ sec : theory - appendix ] , based on the mwc theory ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with mc simulations and numerical scf calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in this context",
    ", we also analyze the chain end fluctuations in weakly polydisperse brushes and introduce the concept of monodisperse brushes as near - critical systems .",
    "the implications for the interaction with hydrodynamic flows are discussed in sec.[sec : hydrodynamics ] .",
    "we close with a summary of the main features of polydisperse brushes in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the appendix summarizes technical details on the scf theory and presents the derivations of analytical results  in particular , the analytical expressions for the green s function of single chains embedded in three types of brush ( monodisperse , moderately polydisperse with exactly linear density profile , and strongly polydisperse ) and the expressions for the hydrodynamic penetration length in these brushes .",
    "the system is composed of a dense polydisperse brush in implicit solvent in a volume @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt periodic boundaries along the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions , while impenetrable boundary walls are placed @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "polymer chains are modelled as chains of beads connected by harmonic springs with the spring constant @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the statistical bond length , @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath27 the temperature .",
    "we will use @xmath25 as the unit length and @xmath28 as the energy unit .",
    "brush chains in the system are grafted with one end each onto a flat substrate located at @xmath29 , which is chosen @xmath30 for practical reasons .",
    "the nonbonded interaction is formulated in terms of the local monomer density , implying that we have soft interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian thus has the edwards type @xcite and can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and the bond length @xmath25 is assumed to be the same for each monomer . in the first term @xmath33 denotes the location of the @xmath34th bead in the @xmath35-th chain , the index @xmath35 running over all @xmath36 brush chains , and @xmath37 is the chain length for the @xmath35-th brush chain .",
    "the second term represents the nonbonded effective monomer - monomer interactions . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the excluded volume interaction parameter measuring the monomer - monomer interaction strength in good solvent .",
    "the microscopic density of monomers is a function of conformation , @xmath39 .",
    "we will use @xmath40 to denote the smoothed density , for example , the ensemble average density , i.e. , @xmath41 . in the present work , we choose @xmath42 , which corresponds in explicit solvent to a flory - huggins parameter @xmath43 ( athermal solvent conditions ) furthermore , we set @xmath44 and @xmath45 , thus defining the simulation units for length and energy .    in the mc simulations ,",
    "local densities are extracted from the position of the beads using a particle - to - mesh technique @xcite , which provides a way for the smoothing of density operators . in the present work we use the first order cloud - in - cells scheme @xcite , which means that monomers are partitioned between their eight nearest neighbour vortices with a weight that depends on the relative distance between the monomer and the vortex .",
    "this implies that two beads interact even when they are in neighbour cells , and thus the interaction distance is effectively larger than cell size .",
    "higher order schemes are conceivable , but computationally more expensive .    for the chain length distribution , we choose the schulz - zimm ( sz ) distribution @xcite , a realistic size distribution that is often adopted to describe polymer polydispersity .",
    "the continuous sz distribution is a two - parameter function , and if one uses @xmath0 , the number - averaged chain length and @xmath46 , a parameter related to the polydispersity index , as the free parameters , the sz distribution can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the gamma function . in the limit of @xmath49",
    "the distribution becomes a @xmath50-peak , while for @xmath51 , it reduces to a simple exponential distribution .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath52 is normalized to unity , and the first order moment is given by @xmath53 as expected , while the high order moments can be obtained by a recursion formula @xmath54 .",
    "the weight - averaged chain length can be calculated as @xmath55 .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of @xmath46 as @xmath56 .    in practice",
    "we have only a finite number @xmath57 of chains in the system ( @xmath1 is the grafting density ) .",
    "we determine all possible sets of @xmath58 chains whose first , second , and third chain length moment are consistent with those of the sz distribution within one percent .",
    "then we perform scf calculations to estimate the brush density profiles of each set ( they are almost identical ) and select the set that produces the smoothest profiles .",
    "this set is then used for the simulations .",
    "disorder averages are carried out with respect to the arrangement of grafting points of the chains @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the number averaged chain length is fixed at @xmath59 .",
    "the system is divided into cubic cells with the size @xmath60 . to study the effect of polydispersity",
    ", we specifically choose three different polydispersities with @xmath61 , and 1 representing vanishingly small , moderate and large polydispersity , and study brushes with grafting density @xmath62 .",
    "the grafting points of the chains on the substrate are fixed on a regular square lattice .",
    "the system size is chosen @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "these systems were studied by mc simulations . in every mc update ,",
    "we try to move the position of one chosen monomer to a new position with a distance in space comparable to the bond length .",
    "this trial move results in an energy change including the bonded and non - bonded energy , and it is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis probability . in all simulations , @xmath66 mc steps per monomer were performed to equilibrate the system , and another @xmath66 mc steps to extract statistical averages .",
    "final statistical quantities were obtained by averaging the results from 48 separate independent mc runs with different arrangement of the grafting points .",
    "a family of brush density profiles for brushes with schulz - zimm chain length distributions and polydispersity indices @xmath67 at fixed surface grafting density @xmath68 and number average @xmath69 is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath70 as indicated .",
    ", width=264 ]    as the polydispersity is increased , the shape of the brush density profiles changes from a concave parabola to a convex curve , and the brush height increases .",
    "several observations turn out to be of very general validity .",
    "first , the area under all the profile curves is the same .",
    "this follows from the definition of the number averaged chain length , @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the area under the curve corresponds to the total number of monomers ( per unit grafting area ) , which is the product of the number of chains per unit area , @xmath1 , and the average number of monomers per chain , @xmath10 .",
    "thus @xmath71 irrespective of the particular shape of the chain length distribution .",
    "the next observation concerns the local brush density near the solid substrate . at the surface one",
    "observes a small dip which is of the order of a few monomer sizes and may be model - dependent .",
    "it is known that off - lattice molecular chain models may produce density oscillations very close to the surface as a result of packing effects @xcite . here , we are interested in the extrapolated density at the surface , @xmath72 , as the property of the smooth model - independent profile .",
    "it is clear for fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] that @xmath72 changes little with increasing polydispersity index , although some decrease is observed for the largest polydispersity , @xmath73 .",
    "the analytical theory of polydisperse brushes developed by milner , witten , and cates ( mwc ) predicts that in the strong - stretching limit under good solvent conditions , within the second - order virial expansion approximation , the extrapolated density @xmath72 is completely determined by one single parameter : the product of @xmath1 and the second virial coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "the same holds for chain length distributions of any shape and any average chain length , and hence , the expression derived for monodisperse brushes is very generally valid : @xmath74    most experimental studies of polymer brushes have focused on investigating the brush height as a function of the average chain length and the grafting density . the original alexander - de gennes theory predicts the scaling form @xmath75and the more detailed scf theory of monodisperse brushes @xcite gives the same scaling with a specific prefactor : @xmath76    numerical scf calculations @xcite have indicated that the same scaling applies to polydisperse brushes . in appendix",
    "[ sec : theory - appendix ] we demonstrate that this scaling follows directly from the mwc theory for any realistic chain length distribution .",
    "thus the form of the chain length distribution only affects the prefactor . for any single - parameter family of chain length distribution",
    "the pre - factor becomes a function of the polydispersity index , hence the height can be written as @xmath77 our goal is to estimate the pre - factor @xmath78 from our mc simulations .",
    "unfortunately , extracting the brush height from numerical data on the density profiles is not entirely straightforward because of the very tenuous tail caused by the chain fluctuations . in monodisperse brushes , a popular way to overcome this problem is to simply extrapolate the parabolic profiles , but this approach is not applicable in general polydisperse brushes .",
    "hence we adopt a simple pragmatic approach and define the brush height @xmath2 as the distance where the density becomes smaller than a threshold value of 0.01",
    ".     reduced by the height of the corresponding monodisperse brush @xmath79 as a function the polydispersity parameter @xmath80 at three different grafting densities @xmath81 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "the straight line corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq : relative_brush_thickness ] ) , width=264 ]    analytical considerations for specific chain length distributions @xcite have suggested that the average height of a polydisperse brush @xmath2 , rescaled by the height of the corresponding monodisperse brush @xmath79 , should be a linear function of @xmath80 for narrow chain length distributions .",
    "we test our simulation results for the brush height against this theoretical prediction . for the sz distribution , we have @xmath82 , and hence we plot the ratio @xmath83 in fig .  [",
    "fig : brush_heights ] vs. @xmath84 for different grafting densities @xmath1 .",
    "explicit analytical predictions for the structure of polymer brushes with experimentally relevant chain length distributions are not found in the literature .",
    "here we provide some results for three cases inspired by simulation results for brushes with sz polydispersity .",
    "the brush density profiles presented above in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ( which correspond to moderate grafting densities and good solvent conditions ) illustrate the systematic changes of the profile shape with increasing polydispersity . for weakly polydisperse brushes with @xmath85 ,",
    "the profiles change very little compared to the purely monodisperse parabolic brush .",
    "thus we can apply exact results available for the latter case to identify weak polydispersity effects .",
    "the moderately polydisperse case is exemplified by the density profile which has a nearly constant slope for @xmath18 . according to the basic tenets of the scf theory , a linear density profile generates a linear mean - field potential .",
    "fortunately , exact solutions are also available for chains in a linear external potential @xcite .",
    "although for the sz case the profile is only approximately linear , we demonstrate that a somewhat different chain length distribution with a similar polydispersity index generates a strictly linear profile ( at least in the strong stretching limit ) .",
    "finally , the case of the largest polydispersity with an exponential chain length distribution and @xmath86 also admits an exact analytical solution in the framework of the mwc theory .",
    "we analyze not only the average brush properties such as the density profile , but also the behavior of individual brush chains including the mean end positions and their fluctuations . in the following",

    "hence @xmath144 can also be interpreted as a stretching parameter , which diverges as @xmath0 becomes infinitely large at fixed @xmath1 , and @xmath145 is proportional to the average energy required to insert a chain into the brush .",
    "the polydispersity parameter , @xmath146 is linked to yet another distance , @xmath147 , from the critical point .",
    "two of us have shown @xcite that for a specific type of asymmetric narrow chain length distributions , the fluctuation enhancement factor scales as @xmath148 .",
    "the origin of the polydispersity effect on the chain fluctuations lies in the special property of the mean force potential in a purely monodisperse brush .",
    "it is known that a broad chain end distribution ( with width of order @xmath2 ) is a necessary requirement for the existence of a monodisperse brush in the limit of asymptotically long chains , irrespective of the particular brush regime ( solvent quality , chain stiffness , etc . )",
    "such a broad distribution requires a cancellation of the elastic forces in the chain at the level of the softest rouse mode .",

    "it is essential that the second derivative @xmath149 is a constant and takes the a critical value of @xmath150 ( in absolute numbers ) .",
    "even a very minor deviation from perfect monodispersity changes the potential shape and leads to a decrease in @xmath149 .",
    "hence , the chain elasticity is not cancelled completely , and this results in a dramatic reduction in the chain end fluctuations . in appendix",
    "[ sec : theory_field_weakly_p ] , we demonstrate this effect using a simple generic form of a chain length distribution linked to the fermi - dirac distribution at low temperatures .",

    "this scaling law is expected to hold in the limit @xmath152 or more generally in cases where @xmath141 is sufficiently small that the fluctuation enhancement of eq .",

    "nevertheless , we can conclude that a brush is a near - critical system as far as the chain fluctuations are concerned . in order to observe this anomalous behavior",
    "one needs to be close to the critical point characterized by the limit @xmath162 .",
    "it is worth restating the consequences of this finding for situations where the critical point is approached along the two directions in the parameter space .",
    "a purely monodisperse brush always demonstrates near - critical chain fluctuations , the relevant distance to the critical point being @xmath163 .",
    "this results in slow ( unentangled ) relaxation with the characteristic relaxation time scaling as @xmath164 which was predicted theoretically @xcite and subsequently verified by several simulations @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations enhancement factor also describes the increase in the relaxation time compared to the rouse time , @xmath165 .",
    "another consequence of the near - critical behavior is the increased chain susceptibility @xcite leading to effects like the `` surface instability '' introduced by sommer and coworkers in refs.@xcite .",
    "there , the end - groups of some brush chains were modified to become sensitive to small variations in the solvent quality , which resulted in the possibility of an abrupt transition for the modified chains either `` hiding '' inside the brush or exposing the end - group at the outer brush edge .",
    "we should note that apart from the individual chain fluctuations , a monodisperse brush exhibits `` normal '' behavior : for example , the density correlation length scales as @xmath166 , i.e. as the mean distance between the grafting points @xcite .",
    "any finite polydispersity automatically limits the fluctuation enhancement .",
    "the mc simulations data show that even at the polydispersity index of @xmath3=1.02 , which is so close to monodisperse that it is actually quite difficult to achieve experimentally , the near - critical behavior is severely suppressed . in the experimentally relevant polydispersity range @xmath167 the enhancement factor",
    "is of order 1 .",
    "thus we expect rouse relaxation times @xmath168 to be restored even in moderately polydisperse brushes . in this range of polydispersities",
    "we also expect the surface instability phenomenon to be considerably weakened if not to disappear completely .",
    "although the limit @xmath169 of vanishing polydispersity is not very interesting from a practical point of view , the fact that it is related to critical behavior with a power - law fluctuation growth makes it quite intriguing from the point of view of fundamental physics .",
    "traditionally , this type of behavior is associated with a continuous ( second order ) phase transition .",
    "can we identify the actual phase transition in brushes at vanishing polydispersity ?",
    "it is clear from the simulation results that the brush density profile essentially does not change in the @xmath169 limit .",
    "thus all the bulk properties of the brush remain the same .",
    "it is difficult to identify an extensive `` order parameter '' that would characterize a continuous change into a new phase with a different symmetry , as in the magnetic counterpart of the des cloizeaux analogy .",
    "qualitatively , the situation rather resembles a supercritical fluid approaching the gas - liquid critical point , where the density remains essentially constant and the symmetry of the underlying phase does not change .",
    "however , the critical point can only be approached from one side .",
    "the regime of two phases ( gas - liquid ) coexistence has no obvious counterpart in the brush case .",
    "on the other hand , recent numerical scf calculations of romeis and sommer @xcite have revealed a possibly related multicritical behavior in binary brushes where the two components @xmath170 have different chain lengths @xmath171 and different solvent selectivities @xmath172 .",
    "these systems exhibit a multicritical point at @xmath173 , which connects two coexistence regions , one in the quadrant @xmath174 and one in the quadrant @xmath175 , where a state with exposed @xmath25-chains coexists with a state with exposed @xmath176-chains .",

    "<S> * abstract : * we study the effect of polydispersity on the structure of polymer brushes by analytical theory , a numerical self - consistent field approach , and monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the polydispersity is represented by the schulz - zimm chain - length distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we specifically focus on three different polydispersities representing sharp , moderate and extremely wide chain length distributions and derive explicit analytical expressions for the chain end distributions in these brushes . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in very good agreement with numerical data obtained with self - consistent field calculations and monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing polydispersity , the brush density profile changes from convex to concave , and for given average chain length @xmath0 and grafting density @xmath1 , the brush height @xmath2 is found to scale as over a wide range of polydispersity indices @xmath3 ( here @xmath4 is the height of the corresponding monodisperse brush . </S>",
    "<S> chain end fluctuations are found to be strongly suppressed already at very small polydispersity . based on this observation </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the concept of the brush as a near - critical system with two parameters ( scaling variables ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , controlling the distance from the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a good description of the simulation data . </S>",
    "<S> finally we study the hydrodynamic penetration length @xmath7 for brush - coated surfaces in flow . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it generally increases with polydispersity . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior crosses over from @xmath8 for monodisperse and weakly polydisperse brushes to @xmath9 for strongly polydisperse brushes . </S>"
