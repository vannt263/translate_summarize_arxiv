    "the calculation exposes two problems with using the lscher - weisz action on a coarse lattice : first , the coarseness of the lattice in the temporal direction severely limits the number of statistically - useful correlator measurements and hampers the demonstration of plateaux in effective masses ; secondly , the unusual properties of the transfer matrix can reduce the effectiveness of the variational method in diminishing excited - state contamination",

    "lscher and weisz @xcite have shown that a transfer matrix can be defined , but it is in general not hermitian ; complex eigenvalues can occur , leading to damped oscillatory behaviour in correlation functions , and negative weight contributions can appear in the spectral decomposition of two - point functions .",
    "nevertheless , the mass spectrum can still be obtained from the exponential decay of correlators for large temporal separations .",
    "care must be exercised , however , in applying variational methods to extract masses from correlators at short time intervals : although invalid , strictly speaking , the variational method may still be practical whenever the coherence length is large enough such that the contributions from the problematic high - energy states are negligible .",

    "effective masses for glueballs in other channels were also studied , but no acceptable signals were obtained .    in order to set the scale , we also measured the string tension @xmath1 .",
