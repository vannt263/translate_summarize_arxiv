    "a very remarkable feature of hardy s nonlocality proof [ 1 ] is that it goes through for any entangled states of a @xmath10 system except those which are maximally entangled such as the singlet state of two spin-@xmath11 particles . at first sight",
    "this might appear rather surprising in view of the fact that maximally entangled states yield the maximum violation predicted by quantum mechanics of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality [ 2 ] . referring himself to this failure ,",
    "hardy states that [ 1 ] , `` the reason for this is that the proof relies on a certain lack of symmetry that is not available in the case of a maximally entangled state . ''",
    "indeed , it has been found [ 1,3 - 6 ] that the set of hardy equations ( see eqs .",
    "( 8a)-(8d ) below ) upon which the nonlocality contradiction is constructed is incompatible for the case of maximal entanglement in the sense that for this case the fulfillment of all three conditions ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) precludes the fulfillment of condition ( 8d ) , and vice versa . from a mathematical point of view",
    "this is the reason for the failure , and this would be the end of the story .    in this paper",
    "i would like to account for this failure from a somewhat different perspective which provides a fuller mathematical understanding of the structure of hardy s theorem .",
    "this will allow us to gain some insight into the physical cause of the inability of completely entangled states to produce a hardy - type nonlocality contradiction .",
    "so , after introducing in sec .  2 some general results concerning the conditions needed to achieve perfect correlations for @xmath10 systems , in sec",
    ".  3 it will be shown that the fulfillment of all three conditions ( 8a)-(8c ) in the case of a maximally entangled state necessarily entails perfect correlation between the two measurement outcomes ( one for each particle ) obtained in _ any _ one of the four possible combinations of joint measurements ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 or @xmath9 , one might actually perform on both particles , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are single - particle observables associated with particles 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "however , as we shall see , the chsh inequality is fulfilled for such maximal - entanglement - induced perfect correlations , and , thereby , no violations of local realism will arise for the maximally entangled state as long as the four observables @xmath14 and @xmath15 involved in the chsh inequality make conditions ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) hold .",
    "indeed , the fulfillment of the chsh inequality for such perfect correlations means that all of them can be consistently explained in terms of a local hidden - variable model ( see , for instance , appendix d in ref .  7 for an explicit example of such a model that accounts for the perfect correlations of two spin-@xmath11 particles in the singlet state ) .",
    "this is ultimately the physical reason why hardy s nonlocality argument does not work for the maximally entangled case .",
    "moreover , as will become clear , the failure of hardy s argument for the maximally entangled state is , interestingly enough , closely related to the fact that the quantum mechanical predictions can not give the maximal possible theoretical violation of the chsh inequality . in sec .  4 ,",
    "the general case of less - than - maximally entangled state is considered , and it is shown how the fulfillment of all the hardy conditions ( 8a)-(8d ) necessarily leads to a violation of the resulting chsh inequality .",
    "the largest extent of this violation is determined . finally , in sec .  5 ,",
    "examples are given illustrating the fact that maximally entangled states yield the maximum quantum mechanical violation of the chsh inequality , while this inequality is necessarily obeyed for such states if these latter are constrained to satisfy the conditions ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) .",
    "hardy s nonlocality proof involves an experimental set - up of the einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm type [ 8,9 ] : two correlated particles 1 and 2 fly apart in opposite directions from a common source such that each of them subsequently impinges on an appropriate measuring device which can measure either one of two physical observables at a time@xmath17 or @xmath18 for ( the apparatus measuring ) particle 1 , and @xmath19 or @xmath20 for ( the one measuring ) particle 2 .",
    "conventionally , it is supposed that the measurement of each one of these observables gives the possible outcomes `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' ( this is the case that arises , for example , in the realistic situation [ 10 ] in which a photon is detected behind a two - channel polarizer , with the value @xmath21 @xmath23 assigned to detections corresponding to the transmitted ( reflected ) photon ) , so that we shall generally assume that the operators associated with such observables are of the form , @xmath24 , with @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and where @xmath25 constitutes an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space pertaining to particle @xmath26 . on the other hand , according to the schmidt decomposition theorem ( see , for instance , ref .  11 for a recent account of this topic ) , we can always write the quantum pure state of our two - particle system as a sum of two biorthogonal terms @xmath27 for some suitably chosen orthonormal basis @xmath28 for particle @xmath26 , with the real coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 satisfying the relation @xmath31 .",
    "now , by expressing the eigenvectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 in terms of the basis vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35@xmath36 one can evaluate the quantum probability distributions @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath13 or @xmath9 , that a joint measurement of the observables @xmath14 and @xmath15 on particles 1 and 2 , respectively , gives the outcomes @xmath39 and @xmath40 when the particles are described by the state vector ( 1 ) .",
    "these are given by @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "of course , the above probabilities add up to unity @xmath48 we will note at this point that for the special case in which @xmath49 ( i.e. , when state ( 1 ) happens to be totally entangled ) , the following two equalities , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , hold true .",
    "now , the expectation value of the product of the measurement outcomes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is defined ( in an obvious notation ) as @xmath52 substituting expressions ( 3a)-(3d ) into eq .",
    "( 5 ) gives @xmath53 ( note , incidentally , that for either @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( i.e. , for product states ) the quantum correlation function ( 6 ) factorizes with respect to the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and consequently it will be unable to yield a violation of bell s inequality . ) in general the correlation function ( 6 ) takes on values in the range between @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in determining the conditions under which this function attains its extremal values @xmath58 . by direct inspection of eq .",
    "( 6 ) it follows at once that whenever we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , perfect correlations happen for any state of the form ( 1 ) irrespective of the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this corresponds to the case that the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 have eigenvectors that arise from the schmidt decomposition of the entangled state ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) . for this case",
    "the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 take the form @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 being sign factors fulfilling @xmath70 ) , and then , from the very structure of the state vector ( 1 ) , it is apparent that a measurement of @xmath14 on particle 1 will uniquely determine the outcome of a measurement of @xmath15 on particle 2 , and vice versa . on the other hand , for the case",
    "in which @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , it follows that in order for the correlation function ( 6 ) to take on its extremal values @xmath58 it is necessary that , ( i ) the state ( 1 ) be maximally entangled , and ( ii ) @xmath74 , @xmath75 . indeed , whenever the equality @xmath76 holds , eq .",
    "( 6 ) reduces to @xmath77 which attains the value @xmath21 or @xmath22 for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "in terms of joint probabilities , a generic two - particle state @xmath81 of the form ( 1 ) will show hardy - type nonlocality contradiction if the following four conditions are simultaneously fulfilled for the state @xmath82 [ 1,3 - 6 ] , s into @xmath22 s , and vice versa .",
    "likewise , the same holds true if we reverse the sign _ only _ to the outcomes of @xmath14 for each of the eqs .",
    "( 8a)-(8d ) .",
    "indeed , as may be easily checked , the following set of conditions @xmath83 will also lead to a hardy - type nonlocality contradiction . naturally , by symmetry",
    ", the same is true if we reverse the sign _ only _ to the outcomes of @xmath15 for each of the eqs .",
    "( 8a)-(8d ) . ]",
    "@xmath84 taking into account the aforementioned equalities , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are valid only in the case that the state @xmath82 is maximally entangled , it is immediate to see that the fulfillment of eqs .",
    "( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) for such a special case implies perfect correlation between the measurement outcomes of @xmath17 and @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "so , for example , if condition ( 8a ) is fulfilled for the maximally entangled state we have that @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath86 of getting different readings for a measurement of @xmath17 and @xmath19 is unity , and thus the measurement outcomes for such observables are perfectly correlated in that whenever the outcome @xmath21 @xmath23 is observed for particle 1 then with certainty the outcome @xmath22 @xmath87 will be observed for particle 2 , and vice versa .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed by the fact that @xmath88 ( see eq .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the measurement outcomes of @xmath17 and @xmath20 , and also to the measurement outcomes of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , if conditions ( 8b ) and ( 8c ) are to be satisfied for the maximally entangled state ; namely , @xmath89 .",
    "now we are going to show that the fulfillment of all three conditions ( 8a)-(8c ) for the maximally entangled state also implies perfect correlation for the observables @xmath18 and @xmath20 , in the sense of having in all cases different measurement outcomes for @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , this makes it impossible the fulfillment of the remaining condition in eq.(8d ) .",
    "first of all we note that , as a general rule , the fulfillment of eqs.(8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) , requires , respectively , that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "this is so because the derivative of @xmath37 with respect to the variable @xmath93 must be zero at the minimum value @xmath94 . for concreteness , and",
    "without any loss of generality , from now on we shall take the choice @xmath95 , so that @xmath96 . recalling that @xmath45 , this in turn implies that the relative phases @xmath97 are constrained to obey the relation @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we deduce that the angle @xmath99 must equally be zero .",
    "of course the fact that the cosine function @xmath100 takes the value @xmath21 [ or else @xmath22 ] is a necessary ( although not a sufficient ) condition in order for the probability in eq.(8d ) to reach its minimum value 0 .",
    "the constraint @xmath102 having been established , all what we need to reach the desired conclusion is the following straightforward mathematical result [ 6 ] , whose proof is given in the appendix .    ' '' ''    _ lemma_for the case that @xmath103 , the necessary and sufficient condition in order for the probability ( 3a ) to vanish is @xmath104 analogously , for the case that @xmath103 , the vanishing of the probability in eq .",

(",
    "11b ) and ( 11c ) , and then substituting eq .",
    "( 11a ) into the left - hand side of the product . ) relation ( 11d ) , together with the above deduced constraint @xmath102 , allows one to finally conclude that the fulfillment of all three conditions ( 8a)-(8c ) by the maximally entangled state necessarily implies that both probabilities @xmath113 and @xmath114 are equal to zero , thus contradicting the condition in eq .",
    "clearly , this in turn means that the correlation function @xmath115 has to take the extremal value @xmath22 .",
    "naturally , the result @xmath116 also follows directly by applying eqs .",

    "indeed , for the case considered we have @xmath117 , and then , by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath118 . now , from eq .  ( 11d ) , the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 ought to satisfy the relation @xmath121 , with @xmath122 being an odd integer @xmath123 .",
    "hence the result @xmath116 , as claimed .",
    "we will note , incidentally , that the fulfillment of condition ( 8d ) for the maximally entangled state precludes the simultaneous fulfillment of all three conditions ( 8a)-(8c ) .",
    "indeed , in order to have @xmath124 for the maximally entangled state it is necessary that ( supposing @xmath102 , and sgn  @xmath125 sgn @xmath30 ) , @xmath126 and thus at least one of the conditions in eqs .",
    "( 11a)-(11c ) can not be satisfied .",
    "as an example of this , consider the case where both conditions ( 11a ) and ( 11b ) are satisfied . yet",
    ", this in turn implies that @xmath127 , and then , from eq .",
    "( 12 ) we have that @xmath128 , in disagreement with eq .  ( 11c ) .",
    "the results following eqs .",
    "( 11a)-(11d ) can be conveniently summarized as follows : whenever we have @xmath129 for the maximally entangled state , then necessarily we must have@xmath116 as well .",
    "an analogous argument could be established to conclude that , whenever @xmath130 for the maximally entangled state , then @xmath131 .",
    "as we have seen , this very fact makes it impossible the simultaneous fulfillment of all the hardy conditions ( 8a)-(8d ) for the nontrivial case of maximal entanglement ( of course , this impossibility holds trivially for the case of product states ) .",
    "let us now consider bell s inequality in the form of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality [ 2 ] .",
    "this can be written as @xmath132 it is evident that , as it should be expected , the perfect correlations we have just derived for the maximally entangled state do satisfy the chsh inequality .",
    "indeed , for this case we have @xmath133 , where the quantity @xmath134 is defined by @xmath135 .",
    "the validity of the chsh inequality for the simplest case of a @xmath10 system described by a pure state is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a ( deterministic ) local hidden - variable model for the observable correlations of all combinations of measurements @xmath136 independently performed on both subsystems [ 12 ] .",
    "system is described by a mixed state the fulfillment of the chsh inequality is not in general a sufficient condition for the existence of a local hidden - variable model that reproduces the results of more complex ( `` nonideal '' ) measurements .",
    "see , for example , the introductory part of the article in ref.13 , and references therein .",
    "] therefore , we can say with complete confidence that all the perfect correlations @xmath137 can be consistently explained by a local hidden - variable model . indeed , it is easy to see that all these perfect correlations are compatible with the assumption of local realism , so that they can be reproduced by a local realistic model .",
    "so , consider for example the case when all the perfect correlations above are @xmath22 , and suppose that a joint measurement of the observables @xmath17 and @xmath19 is carried out .",
    "owing to the perfect correlation @xmath138 , the measurement results for such observables should be , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or else , @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "suppose now that , instead of @xmath19 , the observable @xmath20 had been measured on particle 2 . according to local realism , the result obtained in a measurement of @xmath14 on particle 1",
    "can not depend in any way on which observable @xmath15 happens to be measured on the other , spatially separated particle 2 , and vice versa .",
    "thus , taking into account the constraint @xmath139 , we conclude that , had the observable @xmath20 been measured , the outcome @xmath22 ( @xmath21 ) would have been observed whenever the measurement result for @xmath17 is found to be @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . applying a symmetrical reasoning to the pair of observables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and noting that @xmath140 , we finally deduce that , had @xmath18 been measured on particle 1 , the outcome @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) would have been observed whenever the measurement result for @xmath19 is found to be @xmath22 ( @xmath21 ) . in short , by applying local realism , and for the case that the measurement results for @xmath17 and @xmath19 happen to be , respectively , @xmath141 and @xmath22 ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) , it is concluded that the measurement results for @xmath18 and @xmath20 would have been , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "but of course this is consistent with the fact that @xmath142 .",
    "the compatibility of these perfect correlations with the assumption of local realism implies that the chsh inequality should be satisfied by such perfect correlations , in accordance with our numerical result that the parameter @xmath134 has to be equal to 2 for the maximally entangled state , if this is to satisfy each of the hardy equations ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) .",
    ", @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 ( with each of them taking simultaneously either the @xmath146 or @xmath147 sign ) do not contradict each other when local realism is assumed to hold .",
    "on the other hand , bell s local model for pairs of spin-@xmath11 particles in the singlet state [ 14 ] ( see also sec .",
    "ii and appendix d of ref .  7 ) provides perhaps the simplest example of a local hidden - variable model capable of reproducing the perfect correlations @xmath148 that arise in the special case that @xmath149 or @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the directions along which the spin is measured .",
    "therefore , our demonstration supplemented by bell s model ( or suitable generalizations of it ) allows one to fully describe all the quantum perfect correlations @xmath137 entirely in terms of a local realistic model .",
    "] it is worth noting , however , that no local hidden - variable model exists that accommodates all the perfect correlations @xmath153 , in spite of the fact that there indeed exists a classical model accounting for each of these perfect correlations separately .",
    "this is because for this case the parameter @xmath154 turns to be greater than 2 ( in fact , it attains the maximum possible theoretical value @xmath155 ) , and then the violation of the chsh inequality excludes the existence of a local hidden - variable model that reproduces simultaneously _ all _ four correlation functions involved in it .",
    "it is a well - known fact [ 15 ] that the maximum value of @xmath134 predicted by quantum mechanics is @xmath156 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the maximum possible violation @xmath155 can not be realized in quantum mechanics .",
    "clearly , the parameter @xmath134 takes on the value 4 if , and only if , @xmath153 . from the discussion leading to eq",
    "( 7 ) it follows that , for the general case in which @xmath157 and @xmath158 , it is necessary that the state @xmath82 be maximally entangled , if we want that the quantum correlation function @xmath159 attains the value @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "but , as we have shown , the impossibility for the maximally entangled state to simultaneously satisfy all the hardy equations ( 8a)-(8d ) resides in the fact that , whenever we have @xmath160 for such a state , then necessarily @xmath145 .",
    "the interesting observation then is that the failure of hardy s nonlocality theorem [ 1 ] for the maximally entangled case just prevents the quantum prediction for the parameter @xmath134 from reaching the maximum theoretical value @xmath155 .",
    "indeed , for this case the quantum prediction for @xmath134 falls to 2 , and then all the relevant quantum correlation functions @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath115 can be interpreted in terms of a classical model based on the assumption of local realism .    on the other hand , as already expounded by krenn and svozil [ 16 ] , a maximum violation of the chsh inequality by the value 4 would correspond to a two - particle analog of the ghz argument for nonlocality [ 7 ] . indeed , as we have seen , if we have @xmath164 , then , according to local realism , we must have the prediction @xmath145 , which directly contradicts the ( hypothetical ) result @xmath165 .",
    "as we are dealing with perfect correlations , this contradiction would apply to each of the pairs in the ensemble .",
    "the failure of hardy s theorem for the maximally entangled state can thus also be read as a proof of the fact that it is not possible to construct a ghz - type nonlocality argument for a @xmath10 system ( unless hypothetical extremely nonclassical correlations are assumed to hold [ 16 ] ) .",

    "( 8a)-(8d ) [ 17 ] : @xmath217 quantum mechanics predicts a maximum violation of inequality ( 20 ) for the values @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",
    "the point to be stressed here is that , for this same set of values , quantum mechanics predicts a violation of the chsh inequality which is four times bigger than that obtained for the inequality ( 20 ) .",
    "it is therefore concluded that , in order to achieve a more conclusive , clear - cut experimental verification of hardy s nonlocality theorem [ 1 ] , one could try to measure the observable probabilities in eq .",
    "( 17 ) , once the conditions @xmath220 , and @xmath221 have been established .",
    ", these values remaining necessarily finite . as an illustration of this",
    ", we may quote the experimental results corresponding to the probabilities in eqs .",
    "( 8a)-(8d ) obtained in the first actual test of hardy s theorem [ 18 ] .",
    "this is a two - photon coincidence experiment , and the reported results are @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 , which were obtained for the following polarizer angles , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 .",
    "as can be seen , the first three quoted probabilities are close to zero , while the fourth one is significantly different from zero .",

    "bell inequalities should be satisfied by any realistic theory fulfilling a very broad and general locality condition according to which the real factual situation of a system must be independent of anything that may be done with some other system which is spatially separated from , and not interacting with , the former [ 8,20 ] . when applied to our particular situation",
    ", this requirement essentially means that the effect of the choice of the observable @xmath232 or @xmath233 to be measured on particle @xmath26 , @xmath234 , can not influence the result obtained with another remote measuring device acting on the other particle . for this class of theories",
    "the ensemble ( measurable ) probability of jointly obtaining the result @xmath235 for particle 1 and the result @xmath236 for particle 2 , has the functional form [ 2,21,22 ] @xmath237 in eq .",
    "( 21 ) , @xmath238 is a set of variables ( with domain of variation @xmath239 ) representing the complete physical state of each individual pair of particles 1 and 2 emerging from the source , @xmath240 is the ( normalized ) hidden - variable distribution function for the initial joint state of the particles , and @xmath241 is the probability that an individual particle @xmath26 in the state @xmath238 gives the result @xmath58 for a measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "note that both @xmath240 and @xmath239 are independent of the actual setting @xmath242 or @xmath9 corresponding , respectively , to a measurement of @xmath232 or @xmath233 on particle @xmath26 .",
    "as is well known , classical probabilities of the form ( 21 ) lead to validity of the inequality @xmath243 ( and , generally speaking , to validity of any other bell - type inequality ) .",
    "this is usually proved by invoking certain algebraic theorems ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "22 for a derivation of bell s inequality in the context of actual optical tests of local hidden - variable theories ) . since the fulfillment of all the hardy conditions ( 8a)-(8d ) implies the quantum mechanical violation of the inequality @xmath243 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", it is concluded that no set of probabilities of the form ( 21 ) exists which generally reproduces the quantum prediction ( 18 ) .",
    "the most remarkable exception to this statement is the case where @xmath244 . for this case",
    "quantum mechanics predicts @xmath133 , and then , as was discussed in sec .",
    "3 , a rather trivial classical model of the type considered can be constructed which accounts for each of the quantum perfect correlations @xmath137 .",
    "( which , in bell s concrete model , is a unit vector in three - dimensional space ) uniquely determines the outcome for any spin measurement on either particle .",
    "( 21 ) above , on the other hand , defines a less restrictive ( and , therefore , more general ) type of local hidden - variable theory which is characterized by the fact that now the set of hidden variables @xmath238 describing the joint state of the particles only determines the probability @xmath245 of obtaining a result @xmath58 when the observable @xmath7 is measured on particle @xmath26 , @xmath234 . ]",
    "a final comment is in order about the fact that maximally entangled states yield the maximum quantum mechanical violation of bell s inequality , while they are unable to exhibit hardy - type nonlocality .",
    "the explanation for this seeming contradiction simply relies on the fact that the rather stringent constraints ( 11a)-(11d ) implied by the hardy equations ( 8a)-(8c ) in the case of a maximally entangled state , are not at all present in the derivation of bell s inequality .",
    "indeed , in the case of bell s theorem , all the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 ( @xmath179 ) are treated as independent variables which can assume any arbitrary value regardless of the quantum state @xmath82 at issue , so that the bell inequality will in fact be maximally violated for a suitable choice of @xmath174 and @xmath97 ( provided @xmath248 ) .",
    "so , consider the case in which @xmath249 for each @xmath250 and @xmath251 . for this case the quantum prediction for @xmath134",
    "is given by @xmath252 which attains the value @xmath253 whenever @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 . only if the parameters @xmath174 are constrained to obey the relations ( 11a)-(11d ) , as demanded by the hardy equations ( 8a)-(8c ) in the case of maximal entanglement , we have that @xmath258 for each @xmath250 and @xmath251 , and for some odd integer @xmath259 ( for instance , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 ) , and then @xmath133 .",
    "sgn @xmath30 , so that @xmath264 . for this case",
    "quantum mechanics predicts , @xmath265 .",
    "now the fulfillment of eqs .",

    "this in turn implies that @xmath267 for some odd integer @xmath259 , and thus @xmath133 . ]",
    "consider now the particular case in which @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 ( with the parameters @xmath273 and @xmath247 taking on any arbitrary value ) .",
    "for this case the quantum prediction for @xmath134 becomes @xmath274 which attains the value @xmath156 for @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 .",
    "however , the fulfillment of the hardy equations ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) , and ( 8c ) requires , respectively , that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , the choice @xmath279 entails that @xmath102 , and therefore , for such values , the quantity @xmath134 takes again the value 2 .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that whenever the hardy equations ( 8a)-(8c ) are fulfilled for the maximally entangled state then perfect correlations develop between the measurement outcomes @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtained in any one of the four possible combinations of joint measurements ( @xmath12 ) one might actually perform on both particles . as a result , for such observables @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath134 turns out to be equal to 2 , and hence no violations of local realism will arise in those circumstances .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation entailed by bell s theorem ( with inequalities ) where no constraints such as eqs .",
    "( 8a)-(8c ) need be fulfilled , and then all the relevant parameters can be varied freely . on the other hand , for the nonmaximally",
    "entangled case , we have generally shown that the fulfillment of conditions ( 8a)-(8c ) . ]",
    "necessarily makes the parameter @xmath134 greater than 2 , the greatest value of @xmath134 predicted by quantum mechanics being as large as @xmath280 . as was emphasized in sec .  4",
    ", this result could have some relevance from an experimental point of view , since it indicates that experiments based on the inequality @xmath243 ( with @xmath134 given by eq .",
    "( 17 ) ) would be more efficient in order to exhibit hardy s nonlocality than those based on inequality ( 20 ) .",
