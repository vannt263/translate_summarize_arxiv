    "these conclusions rely on the electron - phonon coupling mechanism : the deformation potential ( in gaas / alas sl ) , whose hamiltonian is proportional to the divergence of vibration modes .    in the case of nbpm around the band gap at @xmath59 ,",

    "phonons below the gap are in quadrature with the layers of the sl and will thus induce a strong electron - phonon coupling in agreement with our predictions .",

    "the discrepancy between our results and the cited work may be explained since calculations of ref .   only consider a sl with a reduced dephasing @xmath111 relative to the sl surface . in the precise case of free boundary conditions and @xmath111",

    "+ the second discrepancy concerns claims of ref .",

    "whatever _ the boundary conditions , only sam exist ( note that this work  @xcite also only considers sl with @xmath111 ) .",
    "if we have restricted our study to the case of free boundary conditions , of course , the study could easily be extended to the case of any boundary conditions . actually ,",
    "as suggested in the begining of the section , we found that fixing the reduced dephasing @xmath111 and varying the boundary conditions produce the same qualitative conclusions as fixing the boundary conditions and varying the relative phase : both sam and slm exists and sam regions dominate the phase space .",
    "we have chosen not to discuss in detail such effects of changing boundary conditions because the case of free boundary conditions is experimentally the most relevant . to illustrate the correctness of our analysis , and in disagreement with statements of ref .",

    "we would like to address here technical problems associated with the observation of slm .",
    "indeed , in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    ", we show that sam regions dominate the phase space .",
    "thus , a high precision on the value of @xmath108 is needed if one wants to observe slm .",
    "this might prove challenging for sl growth . as an illustration ,",
    "let s consider the precision on the thickness of layers produced by molecular beam epitaxy , which is about 2 monolayers ( @xmath1850.5 nm ) .",
    "in the case of the sl already studied ( alas(2.35 nm)/gaas(5.9 nm ) ) a precision of @xmath186  nm on the value of the dephasing @xmath99 corresponds to a precision of @xmath187 on the value of @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath108 exactly matches @xmath188 , the nbpm is a slm for any value of @xmath144 below the gap .",
    "however , if @xmath108 lays in the range @xmath189 , the frequency @xmath144 has to be lower than @xmath190  thz to get slm .",
    "thus , because of the lack of precision on the layers thicknesses , observations of slm would require a protocol that selects nbpm with a low enough frequency ( below the boundary sam / slm shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) : we think such a selection may be achieved by the presence of a substrate .",
    "indeed , the length of the sl and the presence of a substrate is an important parameter that tunes the lifetime of observable phonons created in the sl by the excitation laser .",
    "a precise study of these effects will be detailed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have shown using a fruitful analogy with the parametric oscillator that nbpm could either avoid ( sam ) or love the surface ( slm ) depending on the relative phase of the sl compared to the sample surface . moreover , we have shown that both modes should in principle be observable using judicious experimental parameters . whereas sam have already been observed , experimental evidences of slm will be difficult in view of the technical challenge to achieve a convenient sl . despite these difficulties ,",
    "we think such experiments are possible choosing an appropriate sl length .",
    "the experimental distinction between sam and slm may be demonstrated using pump - probe experiments with different penetrating length lasers .",
    "finally , we would like to underline that our study of sound waves in sl could be generalised to any kind of waves .",
