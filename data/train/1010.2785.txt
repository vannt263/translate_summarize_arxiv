    "theoretical studies suggest that high velocity molecular outflows play important roles in massive cluster forming regions .",

    "the efficient photon leakage through the cavities potentially reduces the radiation pressure exerted on the molecular gas by a factor of 10 ( krumholz 2005 ) , and therefore enhances the stellar accretion rate .",
    "however , if those massive molecular outflows emanated from ob stars are oriented in the bipolar direction which has lower molecular gas density , it is unclear how efficient the outflow momentum and energy can propagate and feedback into the majority of dense molecular gas . from the numerical hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "li & nakamura ( 2006 ) and nakamura & li ( 2007 ) suggested that in the parsec scale molecular cloud , the initial turbulence dissipates quickly , which leads to local contraction and star formations ( see also carroll et al .",
    "the turbulence induced by the outflows from the intermediate mass or solar mass ( proto)stars over the entire parsec scale cloud , however , quickly replenishes the initial turbulence to support the cloud .",
    "the contraction of the cloud is therefore self  regulated with a low star formation efficiency . in such scenarios , the molecular cloud can be maintained in a quasi ",
    "equilibrium state , which may be conducive to the formation of a dense molecular core in its center .",
    "massive stars then are formed in the dense molecular core , and create bright ultracompact ( uc ) hii regions via the stellar ionization .",
    "observationally , extensive single dish surveys of the @xmath0co emissions found high detection rates of massive molecular outflows around the massive cluster forming regions .",
    "in addition , the ubiquitously seen bipolar profiles of the massive molecular outflows ( shepherd & churchwell 1996 b ; beuther et al . 2002 ; zhang et al . 2005 ; wu et al . 2005 ; lpez - sepulcre et al . 2009 ) suggest that the magnetically regulated accretion similar to that in low  mass star formation plays a role in ob star formation . besides the massive bipolar outflows , however , owing to the great complexity of the ob cluster forming regions , identifications of outflows from individual intermediate mass or solar mass stars have been difficult , and the improvements rely on detailed analysis of interferometric data .",

    "the vla / evla observations of the centimeter free - free continuum emission and the cs ( 1 - 0 ) emission suggest that the biconical cavity is undergoing an expansional motion with the velocity of a few kms@xmath8 , which may be powered by the ionized gas pressure .",

    ", we do not see significant detection of @xmath0co emission . according to the galactic rotation curve ( caswell et al .",

    "future observations with higher sensitivity and higher resolution to detect the protostellar cores and to resolve the morphology / alignment of individual outflows / jets will help to clarify the origin of the high velocity @xmath0co emissions .",

    "statistically , we expect the outflow feedback from those systems with low inclination angle quantitatively has the same order of magnitudes as the feedback from outflows which have high inclination angles and are detected in the blueshifted and the redshifted velocity ranges . or , there can be some less energetic outflow systems , as those detected in omc2 and omc3 ( see williams , plambeck , & heyer 2003 , and therein ) .",
    "the contributions of such systems are not significant as compared with the energetic high velocity outflows .",
    "we estimate the deconvolved size scale of each outflow system by performing 2d gaussian fitting of the velocity integrated maps .",
    "the outflow dynamical timescale is estimated by dividing the major axis of the fitted gaussian with the averaged velocity .",
    "the dominant uncertainties in the estimation of the dynamical timescale are caused by the inclination , which is not measured in these observations .",
    "also , owing to the limited angular resolution , we are only able to measure the dynamical timescale greater than 1700 years , assuming a typical outflow velocity of @xmath220 kms@xmath8 .    the dynamical timescale , mass , momentum , and energy of each significant and compact outflow system in g10.6 - 0.4 are summarized in table [ table_outflow ] .",
    "the individual outflow systems have a typical mass of @xmath21 m@xmath6 , and momentum of a few tens of m@xmath6kms@xmath8 .",
    "since we only estimate the physical properties of the outflow systems in the blueshifted and the redshifted velocity ranges while the real outflow systems continue into the intermediate velocity range , these quantities can be underestimated . to provide the sense of how much bias",
    "is made by considering only the limited velocity ranges , we estimate the physical properties of the _ hcn outflow _ both in the blueshifted velocity range and in the entire velocity range with @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) detection . by including the intermediate velocity range",
    ", the dense gas in the massive envelope significantly contributes to the @xmath0co flux , and the estimated mass should be treated as the upper limit of the molecular mass in the outflow system . from table [ table_outflow ] , we see that the results with the inclusion of the intermediate velocity range has a factor of 10 higher mass , a factor of 4 higher momentum , and a factor of 2.7 higher energy .",
    "these results can be understood since the kinetic energy is scaled with the square of velocity , and therefore the low velocity outflow gas in the intermediate velocity range does not contribute to a lot of momentum and energy , as long as its mass is not way much higher than the high velocity components .",
    "thus we conclude that our estimations of the total energy and momentum feedback based on the high velocity components only is accurate up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the estimated physical parameters of _ hcn outflow _ ( table [ table_outflow ] ) can be uncertain owing to the strong photo  dissociation .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the total molecular mass integrated in the line  of  sight of _ hcn outflow _ can be comparably high as the mass enclosed by the nearby hot toroid ( @xmath2200 m@xmath6 ) . based on this argument , we suggest a lower limit of the [ @xmath0co]/[h@xmath29 ] abundance ratio in _ hcn outflow _ to be @xmath210@xmath39 .",
    "we expect the [ @xmath0co]/[h@xmath29 ] abundance ratio in other outflow systems to be less biased from the typical value of 10@xmath36 .",
    "we estimate the outflow mass , momentum , and energy in the entire blueshifted and the redshifted velocity range by integrating the flux in the whole field of view .",
    "for the blueshifted outflows , the total mass is about 6.2 m@xmath6 ; the total line  of  sight momentum is 163 m@xmath6kms@xmath8 ; the total energy is 6.6@xmath3410@xmath35 erg . for the redshifted ( also including the velocity range of 46.2558.25 kms@xmath8 ) outflows , the total mass is about 4.4 m@xmath6 ; the total line  of  sight momentum is 109 m@xmath6kms@xmath8 ; the total energy is 3.2@xmath3410@xmath35 erg .",
    "the estimated mass includes all entrained and shocked gas in the outflows which can be detected in @xmath0co emission .",
    "the dynamical timescale of these outflow systems has the order of 10@xmath4010@xmath41 years . in the blueshifted velocity range , the visually identified compact systems ( b@xmath42 , @xmath43b outflows )",
    "contribute to 89% of the total outflow mass ; 84% of the outflow momentum ; and 72% of the outflow energy .",
    "however , in the redshifted velocity range , the visually identified compact systems ( r@xmath44 outflows ) only contribute to 31% of the total outflow mass ; 20% of the outflow momentum ; and 16% of the outflow energy .",
    "the small fractional contribution of the compact systems ( r@xmath44 outflows ) in the redshifted velocity range can be explained by the significant contribution of the diffuse emission ( figure [ fig_cochan1 ] ) in the velocity range of 8.75  46.25 kms@xmath8 .",
    "those diffuse emission can be contributed by both the foreground molecular emission and the diffuse molecular outflows , which are not distinguishable with the data we currently have .",
    "additionally , the flux of the molecular outflows in the redshifted velocity range is also attenuated by the foreground absorption . since the order of magnitudes of the total mass , momentum , and energy in the redshifted velocity range are still comparable with those in the blueshifted velocity range , we suggest that the contribution of the foreground emission are roughly compensated by the attenuation of the foreground absorption .",
    "therefore , we accept the estimated total outflow mass , momentum , and energy in the redshifted velocity range without modeling and correcting for the foreground effect , and we argue that the relevant discussions are not seriously biased .",
    "the total molecular mass in the region with ch@xmath1oh detection ( figure [ fig_co ] ) is about 10002000 m@xmath6 ( liu et al .",

    "hcn outflow _ or is just a projection effect can be examined by future alma observations of molecular lines and the hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "we note that a few more elongated / filamentary features are resolved in the previous 1.3 cm free  free continuum observation ( sollins et al . 2005 ) .",
    "those elongated / filamentary features have the lengths of @xmath21@xmath9 ( 0.03 pc ) , and width of @xmath540.1@xmath9 ( 0.003 pc ) .",

    "suppose those elongated / filamentary features of 1.3 cm free ",
    "free continuum emission are ionized gas which are undergoing thermal diffusion with velocity of 10 kms@xmath8 , the @xmath540.003 pc widths imply that their age is no more than 300 years .",
    "if all those elongated / filamentary features can also be explained by ionized outflows , the velocities of the outflows can be estimated by @xmath56 this outflow velocity is consistent with the measurement in hydrogen recombination line ( line  of  sight velocity 60 kms@xmath8 , keto & wood 2006 ) , although the ionized outflow is not explicitly resolved in the image .",
    "the higher brightness of those elongated / filamentary features than the ambient regions may suggest that those outflows are originally ejected in molecular form with a much higher density , and then ionized by the stellar radiation .",
    "the molecular counterparts of those ionized outflows are not necessarily detected , especially in the bipolar direction , if stellar ionization is important .",
    "we suggest that the central ob cluster may accrete the molecular gas of very compact / clumpy structures ( see the nh@xmath1 opacity results , sollins & ho 2005 ) , which can survive the stellar ionization .",

    "however , they are not detectable with the current instruments owing to the beam dilution .",
    "in g10.6 - 0.4 , previously we estimated the scalar momentum feedback from the stellar wind and from the ionized gas pressure to be of 10@xmath5710@xmath40 m@xmath6kms@xmath8 ( liu et al .",
    "2010 b ) . from the @xmath0co data presented in this paper ,",
    "we conclude that the total momentum feedback from the protostellar outflows has the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , these feedback mechanisms can still play very different roles in the massive cluster forming regions , owing to their differences in physical properties .",
    "the stellar wind is an isotropic feedback mechanism . by comparing the resulting star formation efficiency in numerical hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "nakamura & li ( 2007 ) suggested that the _ spherical wind _ can not propagate efficiently in dense gas .",
    "the feedback from such mechanisms is trapped in small size scale , where the induced turbulence is quickly dissipated .",
    "therefore the energy feedback from the _ spherical wind _ supports the cloud less efficiently .",
    "the protostellar outflow is ejected from objects embedded in the local overdensities .",
    "its momentum , however , is typically collimated in a small solid angle , which makes it penetrate the dense gas easily and can produce large scale disturbance .",
    "the induced protostellar turbulence potentially replenishes the dissipated initial turbulence in large scale , and plays the role of regulating the cloud contraction and the star formation efficiency .    from the numerical simulation ,",
    "mac low ( 1999 ) suggested the characteristic timescale of turbulence dissipation @xmath58 and the free  fall timescale @xmath59 have the relation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the driving scale of the turbulence , @xmath62 is the jeans length , and @xmath63 is the rms mach number of the turbulence . assuming a total mass of 10002000 m@xmath6 is enclosed in the 0.5 pc scale envelope , the global free  fall timescale is about 10@xmath3 years .",
    "if the averaged gas temperature is 3050 k , the jeans length is about 0.1 pc .",
    "the typical value of @xmath63 can be 510 .",
    "assuming the main driving source of the turbulence is the compact ( proto)stellar outflows , the value of @xmath61 can be estimated by the physical size scale of the observed outflow systems , which is about 0.06 pc ( 2@xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , the characteristic timescale @xmath58 in g10.6 - 0.4 is about 0.230.47 times of t@xmath64 , which is about a few times of 10@xmath41 years . among the outflow systems detected in g10.6 - 0.4 ,",
    "the maximum outflow dynamical timescale is about 10@xmath41 years , which is smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "the estimations of outflow energy in section [ chap_estimation ] suggests that the energy injection from the protostellar turbulence is capable of balancing the turbulence energy dissipation in the relevant timescale .",
    "we provide rough estimations for the total protostellar mass from a fiducial momentum ejection efficiency i@xmath65 = p@xmath66m@xmath66 , where i@xmath65 is the total ejected scalar momentum , m@xmath66 is the total stellar mass , and p@xmath66 is a proportional factor .",
    "following nakamura & li ( 2007 ) , we adopt p@xmath66= 50 kms@xmath8 . in g10.6 - 0.4 , the projected scalar momentum in the blueshifted and",
    "the redshifted velocity ranges is 273 m@xmath6kms@xmath8 , which leads to @xmath67@xmath34m@xmath66 = 5.45 m@xmath6 , where @xmath67 is the ratio of the scalar momentum contributed by the line  of  sight velocity component to the total scalar momentum .",
    "statistically the value of @xmath67 can be estimated by @xmath68 assuming the inclination angle of the outflows are uniformly randomly distributed .",
    "given the 10002000 m@xmath6 total molecular mass in the envelope , the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in the past 10@xmath41 years is about 0.42%0.86% . assuming a uniform star formation rate in the time domain , the star formation efficiency in one free ",
    "fall timescale is of the order of a few percent .",
    "this estimated sfe is comparable to the sfe in the simulations of nakamura & li ( 2007 ) , consistently suggesting the cloud contraction is self  regulated by the local star formation .",
    "high resolution observations of the thermal dust emission to statistically study the prestellar and protostellar cores , will further improve the constraint on the efficiency of the outflow feedback .",
    "the number of the ysos can be statistically estimated by dividing m@xmath66 with the averaged protostellar mass @xmath69 .",
    "the fiducial value of @xmath69 based on the scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function ( imf ) is 0.5 m@xmath6 . in g10.6 - 0.4",
    ", the value of @xmath69 can be biased by the evolutionary stage , and potentially the observational selection bias that we only pick up the systems with powerful molecular outflows . assuming the detected outflows are associated with ysos , which on average have @xmath21 m@xmath6 stellar mass , the number of the ysos can be estimated by m@xmath66/1.0 = 8.56 .",
    "the surface density of these ysos in the @xmath20.5 pc region is therefore @xmath28.56/(0.5@xmath57 ) @xmath2 34 pc@xmath70 .",
    "the derived yso surface density should be treated as a lower limit since our observations do not trace protostellar objects which have weak or no outflows .    alternatively",
    ", we can assume each of the compact high velocity outflows ( r@xmath44 , b@xmath42 , @xmath43 ) is associated with one protostellar objects .",
    "considering also the non  identified outflow systems in the intermediate velocity range , there can be @xmath210 protostellar objects in total in the observed region .",
    "if estimating the averaged mass of each protostellar object by 1 m@xmath6 , our observational results suggest that an order of @xmath210 m@xmath6 molecular gas are converted into ( proto)stellar objects in @xmath210@xmath41 years .",
    "the system potentially evolves into a stellar cluster with on order of 10@xmath57 stars in a few t@xmath64 .",
    "the ionized gas only propagates in low density regions , which have low recombination rates . however , our previous studies ( liu et al . 2010",
    "b ) suggest that the thermal pressure of the ionized gas is capable of driving the large scale ( a few times of 0.1 pc ) coherent motions , such as the expansional motions of the ionized cavities or the bubble walls .",
    "the absolute velocity of such kind of motion is about a few kms@xmath8 , and which is smaller than the thermal sound speed of the ionized gas ( @xmath210 kms@xmath8 ) .",
    "the efficiency of converting the kinetic energy in such expansional motion to the large scale turbulence energy has to be investigated in theoretical studies .",
    "we present the arcsecond resolution interferometry observations of the @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) transition . from the distribution and the mass / momentum / energy of the detected high velocity outflows , we discuss the role of the outflow feedback in the massive cluster formation region .",
    "our main results are :    * we detect multiple high velocity outflow components in the blueshifted and the redshifted velocity ranges , respectively .",
    "the total molecular mass in these outflow systems are about 10 m@xmath6 , and the total momentum and energy budgets are of the order of 10@xmath57 m@xmath6kms@xmath8 and 10@xmath4 erg , respectively . * no high velocity bipolar molecular outflow parallel to the global rotational axis is directly detected around the central 0.1 pc hot toroid .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that it is photo  ionized . *",
    "the @xmath0co outflows are interacting with the dense molecular envelope , which can be diagnosed by the ch@xmath1oh , hcn , and the sio shock signatures .",
    "* from the distribution of the uc hii regions , we know that multiple massive stars have been formed in the 0.5 pc scale massive envelope , and not only formed in the central 0.1 pc hot toroid . from the association of high velocity outflows with water maser sources , and with the interaction signatures detected in thermal molecular emission , we suggest that multiple protostellar objects with @xmath210 m@xmath6 in total may also have been formed within 10@xmath41 years . the star formation efficiency over one global free  fall timescale is of the order of a few percent .",
    "* we detect strongly enhanced hcn ( 3 - 2 ) emission in a outflow system near the hot toroid , and therefore suggest that hcn is not a good tracer for the global dynamics .",
    "we will follow up the polarization observation to provide thorough discussions of the energetic relation in this source .",
