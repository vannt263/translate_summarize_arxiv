    "the problem of the propagation of radiation in a non - uniform medium is a general one in astrophysics , which arises in many different contexts .",
    "we consider here the common case that the medium consists of clumps or clouds with a low volume filling factor , but potentially high covering factor .",
    "these clumps or clouds may possess a range of properties .",
    "this paper gives a summary of our derivation and results , a more detailed proof will be published elsewhere ( conway , elitzur and parra 2004 , in prep ) .",
    "the specific problem we address is the expected response of a telescope beam observing a low filling factor clumpy region where the beamwidth is much larger than the typical cloud diameter . in this case",
    "we can show that that expectation value of the beam average equals the ensemble expectation value over many realisations of observations along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "we first ( see section 2 ) analyse the case of continuum ( e.g. dust ) clouds absorbing background radiation , then spectral line absorption ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we consider spectral line emission and apply the formalism to the interpretation of co line ratios . finally in section 5",
    "we draw conclusions and describe future work .",
    "let us consider continuum radiation transfer in a clumpy medium of dust clouds .",
    "first assume that all clouds / clumps are identical .",
    "assume further that radiation @xmath2 entering a clump emerges as @xmath3 , where the clump response is @xmath4 . in terms of cloud opacity @xmath5 .",
    "hitting successively @xmath6 clumps that all have the same response factor produces the aggregate response @xmath7 .",
    "implicit in this assumption is that the interaction with the radiation does not change the clump response factor @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown that provided the clump volume filling factor is small the probability of getting @xmath6 clumps along a given line of sight always obeys a poisson distribution , characterised by one number , the mean @xmath8 along a los . in this case of one clump type it can be shown that the mean response is as previously derived by natta & panagia ( 1992 ) .",
    "next consider the case of many types of clumps with response factors @xmath9 ( these could be clump types having different optical depths ) each obeying poisson statistics .",
    "if the fraction of clumps of each type is @xmath10 then ( see conway , elitzur and parra 2004 , in prep )    this means that the problem of a mixture of cloud optical depths ( @xmath11 ) is equivalent to that of the single cloud type having an average @xmath12 obtained from    we can generalize the result in eq .",
    "( 2 ) to the case where the clump type varies continuously . for instance if the clump type is described by continuous variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( which may correspond for instance to peak optical depth and distance from the centre of clouds which have spatial structure ) then we have    and likewise for any number of dimensions of continuous parameters , where @xmath15 is the distribution function of clump types .",
    "in the spectral line absorption problem we aim to calculate the expectation value of a frequency dependent absorption response function given a population of clouds .",
    "this cloud population has in general a distribution of central los velocities and a range of spectral profiles and spatial structures .",
    "observed absorption lines are generally published as a function of doppler velocity @xmath16 , the response at velocity @xmath17 being understood to represent the response at observing frequency @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the line s rest frequency .",
    "let us concentrate on calculating the response at a particular velocity @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in principle clouds having all possible centre velocities",
    "@xmath20 contribute to the spectral response at velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the centre velocity of each cloud @xmath20 can simply be thought of as yet another continuous variable describing the cloud properties , so the full distribution function becomes @xmath21 . for",
    "spectral line clouds the response function is @xmath22 which if cloud types are defined to have fixed spectral profiles which do nt vary with centre velocity can be written @xmath23 . hence applying eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain    as before @xmath8 is the mean number of clouds ( at any velocity ) per los .",
    "@xmath24 can be interpreted at each @xmath25 value as a convolution of the cloud velocity profile for this @xmath14,@xmath13 , @xmath26 with the velocity distribution function of the cloud population @xmath27 followed by an integration over all @xmath14,@xmath13 ( and any other continuous cloud parameters ) .",
    "if the fractional distribution of clouds of different kinds is independent of velocity , then @xmath28 is a separable function . in this case",
    "we can define a mean cloud spectral response    in this separable case the expectation value of the emerging spectrum is in this expression @xmath29 denotes convolution , @xmath30 describes the cloud velocity distribution ; more precisely defined as the mean number of clouds per unit velocity per los .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 = + @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the opacity profile of each clump type , and the brackets denote an average over the clump population .",
    "the @xmath34 can be interpreted as the mean cloud emission profile . in the normal case",
    "that the @xmath35 distribution is much broader in velocity than @xmath34 we obtain the good approximation that @xmath36 where @xmath37 has dimensions of velocity and can be considered the equivalent width of the mean cloud profile .    another way to view the effect of clumping is to note that where @xmath38 is the mean line of sight opacity and @xmath39 is a factor taking into account clumping which is    remarkably we find that the effect of an arbitrarily complex clump distribution can usually be reduced to a single number , @xmath39 .",
    "this factor @xmath39 reduces the effective opacity of a clumpy medium compared to a smooth gas of the same mean column density .",
    "martin et al .",
    "( 1984 ) partially derived our results , but their derivation was less direct and the full generality of the result was not stated .",
    "the expressions for opacity derived above can be adapted ( conway , elitzur and parra 2004 , in prep ) to predict the emissivity in the case of a population of clouds with a mixture of excitation temperatures and statistical properties along the line of sight . here",
    "we discuss only the simplest case that all clouds have the same excitation temperature @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the observed spectral brightness temperature is    to illustrate the impact of clumping on observed line profiles and line ratios we show an example in fig 1 involving the @xmath1co(1 - 0)and @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) lines . in this example",
    "the cloud population consists of only one clump type with a gaussian opacity velocity profile @xmath33 , and a much broader gaussian @xmath35 cloud velocity distribution .",
    "the expectation value of the total opacity along each los @xmath41 is therefore also a gaussian whose peak we term the peak total opacity.    the different panels for fig 1 have different combinations of the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) peak total and peak cloud opacities .",
    "the ratio of intrinsic @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) opacities is set to @xmath42 so that in all the panels of fig 1 , the @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) total and cloud opacities are @xmath43 and hence are optically thin . in all cases therefore the @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) line profiles are gaussian with peak value ( in units of @xmath40 ) equal to the total @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) opacity divided by 60 . in contrast",
    "the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) line profiles and their ratio to the @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) lines depend critically on the clump opacity which affects @xmath39 . only for the case in the top left panel , which has both a low total and low clump opacity , is the observed line ratio equal to the intrinsic value .",
    "if either or both total and clump opacities are larger than 1 then a smaller line ratio is observed , but it is impossible just from the line ratio at line centre to distinguish the different cases",
    ". an important consequence of eq .",
    "( 9 ) is that when the cloud velocity distribution is much broader than individual clouds it is in principle impossible from the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) spectra alone to separate the effects of clumping and variations in the intrinsic @xmath1co(1 - 0)/@xmath0co(1 - 0 ) opacity ratio . in going from panels on the top row with low opacity clumps to the bottom row with large clumps the @xmath1co(1 - 0 )",
    "clump factor @xmath39 is reduced .",
    "the resulting spectra are the same as if there was no clumping but the intrinsic @xmath1co(1 - 0)/@xmath0co(1 - 0 ) opacity ratio was reduced .",
    "we have derived general expressions for both continuum and spectral line radiation propagation in a clumpy medium .",
    "these expressions hold provided only that the clumps have a small volume filling factor and that the local emissivity is not itself affected by the local line spectra .",
    "( 8),(9 ) and ( 10 ) provide simple expressions that can be used by observers to interpret observed line profiles . in section 4",
    "we illustrated the application of this equation to co line emission profiles from a clumpy medium .",
    "although the results presented in section 4 are not new our equations provide a way to understand line profiles from clumpy media in a systematic and quantitative way .",
    "we are working to extend our formalism to predict variances and higher order statistics of spectra from clumpy media .",
    "we also hope to use our formalism as a propagator term in physical spectral line models of clumpy media",
    ". in general in such models emissivity will depend on the local spectrum so such models must be iterative .",
    "finally we are actively working ( see parra et al .",
    "these proceedings ) on the problem of maser propagation in a clumpy medium .",
    "formally exactly the same equations apply as in the thermal case , the only difference is the use of negative opacities .",
    "however as well as physical complications of maser saturation there is a more subtle effect that even for unsaturated masers the formal means predicted by the equations are not good predictors of observations .",
    "the reason for this is that these mean values are dominated by events causing very large amplification which are also very improbable , such that they never occur within a typical source ."
