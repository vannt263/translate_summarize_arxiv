    "s. wu proved in @xcite a double inequality @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are distinct positive real numbers .",
    "later , this inequality was sharpened and extended by wu and debnath @xcite who proved that for distinct positive real numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have @xmath16 if @xmath15 or @xmath17 , and a reverse inequality holds if @xmath18 .    in this work , ( see theorem  [ th31 ] ) , we will we extend and generalize this further , by finding sharp bounds , depending only on @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for the ratio @xmath22 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real parameters satisfying some conditions .",

    "we find that @xmath84 is increasing on @xmath83 .    now , noting that @xmath85 we conclude that , if @xmath86 then @xmath66 is increasing on @xmath83 , as the product of two positive increasing functions .",
