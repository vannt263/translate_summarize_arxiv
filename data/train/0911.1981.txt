    "evolutionary game theory has attracted great interest recently from many scientific fields @xcite .",
    "physicists , biologists , economists and many other scientists have found it challenging to study multi - agent evolutionary systems .    the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game @xcite is an excellent toy model to describe the sharpest conflict situation between individual and common interest as it contains all the basic features of such interactions .",
    "the original pd game is a two - person one - shot game where players can choose between two types of behavior , to cooperate or to defect .",
    "they earn payoffs according to the simultaneous decisions of both participants .",
    "a cooperator gets the sucker s payoff ( @xmath1 ) against a defector , while successful defection yields the temptation to defect ( @xmath2 ) for the defector .",
    "mutual cooperation is rewarded by @xmath3 for each player , while two defectors ( receiving payoff @xmath4 ) punish each other with the defective behavior .",
    "the game is a classical pd game if the payoffs accomplish the relation @xmath5 .",
    "this inequality causes two selfish ( rational ) players to defect independently of the other players decision , thus they get the second worst payoff instead of the second best one for mutual cooperation resulting in a dilemma situation . if @xmath6 , the social dilemma is weakened because the unilateral deviation from the mutual cooperation is not beneficial @xcite . in the latter so - called stag hunt ( sh )",
    "game to act identically to the partner s strategy would result the highest payoff similarly to the coordination game .",
    "the introduction of spatiality @xcite revealed fundamentally new solutions of the game , which can not be detected in the well - mixed situation . in spatial evolutionary models ,",
    "players are located on the sites of a network where the links of the network define their possible connections .",
    "players gain their accumulated payoff from games with their immediate neighbors and sometimes - according to the evolutionary dynamics - they can adopt the strategy of a neighbor .",
    "usually the strategy adoption probability depends on the payoff difference and in accordance with the darwinian principle , individuals with higher payoff ( fitness ) have a greater chance to supersede the less successful ones . due to the spatial scenario , cooperation can survive in the system , even if only the simplest strategies are allowed , i.e. unconditional cooperation and defection . here , cooperators form clusters and support each other through the short range local interactions while defectors punish each other with mutual defection .",
    "the invasion processes along the borders of the clusters depend on the irregularity of the interface , the underlying network(s ) , and the evolutionary dynamical rule .",
    "the pd game was studied on many types of networks ( different lattices @xcite , scale - free graphs @xcite , small world networks @xcite , etc . ) , investigating the effect of basic topological features on the measure of cooperation . to reduce the number of degrees of freedom , evolving networks",
    "@xcite were examined , too . in these models",
    ", players have the opportunity to change their neighbors during the evolutionary process to attempt to increase their income , i.e. , the strategy distribution and the connectivity graph co - evolve . as a result of this evolution",
    ", highly cooperative communities could be established .",
    "the simultaneous change of strategy and a player - specific parameter , has been extended to other quantities , too .",
    "for example , fort @xcite studied models where the elements of payoff matrix were inherited in parallel with the strategy adoption .",
    "the evolution of the strategy pass capability @xcite or the interaction range of players @xcite are also discussed .",
    "moyano and sanchez @xcite studied the competition between several pairs of dynamical rules controlling the strategy adoption in the system .",
    "the latter results have motivated us to study the evolution of a noise - related parameter @xcite , which frequently characterizes the uncertainty in the adoption process @xcite .",
    "many things can cause this uncertainty , such as temporal or spatial fluctuations in the payoff values , errors in decision or in perception , emotions , individual point of view ( free will ) , etc .",
    "the role of the noise parameter at different underlying graphs was studied thoroughly in several studies @xcite .",
    "it turned out that on structures that can be fully perambulated by stepping only on overlapping triangles ( i.e. , on structures with triangle percolation ) , cooperation could be maintained in the widest parameter range when the measure of noise was minimal @xcite . while on structures without triangle percolation , the optimal measure of noise for cooperation",
    "is shifted to positive values .    in this article , we study the simulatenous evolutions of noise parameter - as the quantity characterizing the adoption rule - and strategy distributions on different , relevant structures .",
    "square lattice and the kagome lattice will be analyzed as good examples for graphs with and without triangle percolation . in our model",
    ", players can apply different noise parameter and during the evolutionary process , they can adopt not only the strategy of another neighboring player but also the individual noise parameter .",
    "in other words , a player can learn not only a more successful strategy but also the way how successful player reacts to the payoff differences , i.e. his adoption rule .",
    "the two elementary , evolutionary steps are independent .",
    "we will show that as a result of this dynamics , only one noise level remains in the final state even if several strategies can co - exist in the co - existence region and the remaining noise level is close to the one providing the highest cooperation for systems with homogeneous noise distribution . in a previous letter",
    "@xcite we have considered only the case of weak pd .",
    "now the latter investigation is extended to the parameters over the limits of the weak pd and sh games by revealing the connection of cooperation density surface and the location of fixed noise level .",
    "finally we briefly discuss what happens if not only the strategies and the way of strategy adoption but also the payoff matrix are allowed to adopt throughout the same imitation mechanism .",
    "we used monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and an extended version of the dynamical mean - field approximation ( detailed here ) to perform the investigations .",
    "in our model , players are located on the sites @xmath7 of a square ( consisting of @xmath8 sites with periodic boundary conditions ) or a kagome lattice ( @xmath9 sites ) .",
    "these interaction graphs can be used as the two representatives of the characteristic features of two - dimensional lattices , i.e. lattices with and without triangle percolation .",
    "players can follow one of the simplest strategies that is unconditional cooperation ( @xmath10 ) or unconditional defection ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "they gain their cumulated payoffs from one - shot pd games with their four nearest neighbors .",
    "to reduce the necessary parameters we are using a re - scaled payoff matrix suggested by nowak and may @xcite where the reward of mutual cooperation is @xmath12 while mutual defection yields @xmath13 income .",
    "a cooperator gains @xmath14 payoff when facing a defector while a successful defector gets the temptation to defect ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we investigate an extended parameter space @xmath16 to explore the sh region , too , while @xmath14 refers to the so - called weak pd for @xmath17 .    for the mc simulations , we use random initial strategy distribution where both @xmath18 and @xmath19 strategies are present with the same frequency . beside the strategy , each player possesses another parameter describing his willingness to make rational decision : having individual adoption rule ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this parameter can be interpreted as a personal noise parameter as it contains the possible uncertainty factors in the strategy adoption .",
    "such factors can emerge from the fluctuation of payoff parameters , changing of environment , errors in decision , individual freedom to risk a given amount of income , etc . depending on the situation which is modelled . in our model , initially , we associate an adoption parameter @xmath20 to every player from a finite set , that is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the number of different @xmath0 values .    during the evolutionary process , we choose two neighboring players ( @xmath7 and @xmath23 ) randomly , and we calculate their accumulated payoffs ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) gained from pd games with their neighbors . in an elementary evolutionary step , player @xmath7 can adopt the strategy @xmath26 and/or the noise value @xmath27 of player @xmath23 with the probability @xmath28}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] the possible adoption of the strategy and the noise value happens independently of each other , i.e. , it is possible that only one of them is adopted in an elementary step .",
    "as the darwinian principle dictates , for @xmath29 , both the strategy and the adoption rule of player @xmath23 is very likely to be adopted .    according to the proposed protocol",
    ", the adoption rule of player @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) can still be adopted even if the strategies are the same ( @xmath30 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the adoptions of strategies and rules can end independently arriving to one of the absorbing states formed by identical strategies and/or uniform adoption rules . in the absence of mutation",
    "the system can not leave these states .",
    "in general , the existence of many absorbing states can cause technical difficulties in the interpretation of numerical results achieved on small systems . for small sizes",
    "the system evolve quickly into one of the absorbing states despite the existence ( `` long - time stability '' ) of a mixed state in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "these difficulties can be avoided by using sufficiently large system sizes that increases the duration of simulations .",
    "we will show , however , that the significantly faster simulations on small systems can also be utilized to extract accurate quantities characterizing the behavior of the present evolutionary games .",
    "as we stressed , we used the same adoption probability for both evolving quantities determined by eq .",
    "[ eq : prob ] .",
    "however , the time scales of evolutions can be distinguished , namely the strategy or the noise parameter may evolve faster or slower .",
    "such a time scale separation of coevolving quantities was already studied in several earlier works @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation was the shift of effective payoff elements if the link of players , as an evolving quantity , change much faster than their strategies . in our case",
    "the time separation can be easily done by adding a multiplicative @xmath32 prefactor to the transition rate of evolving quantity resulting a slower evolution comparing to the other one .",
    "simulations show the fixed @xmath33 noise value is robust : the system arrives into the same state independently on the time scale separation of evolving quantities .",
    "the fixation time , however , depends strongly on the applied @xmath34 parameter .",
    "accordingly , the results presented in the next sections are corresponding to the @xmath35 case .    starting the system from a random distribution of strategies and noise parameters",
    "the iteration of the above elementary processes governs an evolutionary process that can be quantified by recording the fraction @xmath36 of cooperators as well as the portion @xmath37 of players following the dynamical rule @xmath38 . in one time unit ( called mc step , in short , mcs )",
    "each player has a chance once on average to adopt a strategy and/or noise value of a neighbor .",
    "finally we mention that for homogeneous dynamical rule ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) the present model is identical to a previously studied spatial model @xcite as discussed briefly below .",
    "furthermore , for homogeneous strategy distribution [ @xmath41 ( or @xmath19 ) , @xmath40 ] all the players receive the same payoff [ @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) , @xmath40 ] and the adoption probability ( [ eq : prob ] ) becomes uniform , i.e. , @xmath45 and the evolution of the @xmath20 distribution becomes identical to the process described by the @xmath22-state voter model @xcite .",
    "first we briefly outline the outcome if all players have the same adoption parameter ( @xmath46 , @xmath40 ) , i.e. , if only the strategy distribution can evolve @xcite . in this case , on lattices as underlying graphs , we can usually distinguish three regions when increasing @xmath47 for a fixed @xmath0 parameter .",
    "only cooperators remain in the final state after a transient time if @xmath48 . on the contrary , for @xmath49 ,",
    "defectors prevail . while the @xmath18 and @xmath19 strategies coexist in the region @xmath50 where the concentration of cooperators decreases continuously from 1 to 0 when increasing @xmath47 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",

    "the lower plot of fig .  [ selection ] illustrates a situation where the four additional @xmath38 values are very close to the distinguished @xmath60 value . although the evolution of adoption rules is still straightforward , but the relevant increase in the relaxation time may be related to the smaller difference in driving force favoring @xmath63 at the expense of others .",

    "this feature has inspired us to study the effect of strategy mutation on the darwinian selection of noise levels in the regions where only cooperators ( @xmath65 ) or defectors ( @xmath66 ) would remain alive if the evolution was controlled by only imitations .",
    "for this purpose , in a few simulations , the above mentioned evolutionary rule is extended by allowing each player to change her strategy ( from @xmath18 to @xmath19 or conversely ) with a small probability @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ mutation ] shows that slightly above @xmath78 the darwinian selection favors also a distinguished rule @xmath79 ( in the presence of rare mutations ) that can be considered as the analytical continuation of @xmath55 obtained within the coexistence region .",

    ", the speed of this process vanishes with @xmath77 .",
    "if we take @xmath65 value , being in the sh region , the introduction of small mutations will result a fixation value that can be also considered as an analytical continuation of fixed @xmath60 values from the @xmath80 interval .",

    "the eight possible configurations can be given using by only three parameters due to the symmetries and compatibility conditions .",
    "these configuration probabilities are determined by solving a set of differential equations expressing the derivative of @xmath136 with respect to time ( denoted as @xmath140 ) .",
    "the main difficulties in the application of this method comes from the fact that the contribution of the elementary processes ( here strategy adoption between two neighboring sites ) to the quantity @xmath140 depend on the configuration containing seven sites .",
    "figure [ kag_dmf ] illustrates an elementary process with the neighborhood affecting the probability of strategy adoption from site @xmath23 to @xmath7 .",
    "this process decreases @xmath141 and simultaneously increases @xmath142 with a value @xmath143 where @xmath144 describes the payoff dependence defined by ( [ eq : prob ] ) and @xmath145 denotes the seven - site configuration probability .",
    "for the the present connectivity structure the latter quantity can be approximated by a bayesian formula : @xmath146 where the one - site configuration probability in the denominator can be also expressed by the three - site configuration probabilities as @xmath147 summarizing the contribution of all the possible elementary processes affecting the values of @xmath140 one can derive a set of differential equations .",
    "now we do not wish to display the huge formulae depending only on the three - site configuration probabilities due to approximative formula ( [ eq : p7 ] ) . instead of it",
    "we emphasize that one can easily develop a computer algorithm to collect systematically all the contributions and the resultant formulae can be used to find the stationary solution(s ) numerically for any values of parameters . in the knowledge of the stationary solutions of the three - site configuration probabilities the most relevant characteristic of the stationary state can be evaluated , for example , @xmath148 . using this approach",
    "the @xmath53 phase diagram was reproduced qualitatively well in @xcite .    in the present work",
    "this method is extended by substituting @xmath149 for @xmath150 where @xmath151 or @xmath19 and @xmath152 or @xmath153 .",
    "this extension does not influence the applicability of the above described method .",
    "using only two initial adoption rules , it was possible to keep the number of the feasible configurations low enough so that the numerical solution of the differential equation system was fairly fast .",
    "it turned out that this method is capable to reproduce all the relevant features characterizing the darwinian selection of the dynamical rules .",
    "for the quantitative analysis we used small @xmath154 values to evaluate the position of the attractor ( @xmath60 ) and the separatrix for any values of @xmath47 .",
    "the results are summarized and compared with the mc data in fig .",
    "[ kag_3p ] .",
    "the predictions of the generalized mean - field approximation for the pd region are in excellent agreement with mc data .",
    "as both approaches stated , there are two attractors in a restricted interval of @xmath47 where a separatrix marking the border of basins of attractors tends to @xmath124 if @xmath0 decreases .",
    "it also means that the basin of attractor @xmath130 keeps getting wider with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "when separatrix reaches the other fixed point the latter disappears resulting a unique fixed point in the large @xmath47 region . turning to the sh side ,",
    "the dynamical cluster approximation predicts increasing @xmath60 fixed point as we leave @xmath124 , which is again in nice agreement with the mc results .",
    "further decreasing @xmath47 , however , the approximation predicts a small two - attractor region and finally the @xmath55 function coincides with the phase boundary where @xmath105 becomes 1 .    before evaluating the predictions of the present cluster mean - field approach",
    ", we should stress that the simpler ( two - state ) version of the three - site approximation , which is valid for homogeneous @xmath0 case , can not describe correctly the functions @xmath99 as well as @xmath51 in the low @xmath0 limit .",
    "namely , the border of all c phase tends to @xmath155 instead of @xmath124 when @xmath156 .",
    "( according to this , defectors can survive the deterministic limit when @xmath106 . )",
    "such a qualitative failure of the approximation might have been the consequence of the small number of independent variables . in other words ,",
    "the restricted freedom prevents the approximation to find the valid solution . at the same time , if we increase the number of independent variables by letting different @xmath38 values for players , the approximation is already capable to find the relevant solution ( at least in the vicinity of @xmath124 ) .",
    "our argument is supported by the fact that the five - site approximation for the homogeneous @xmath0 model can also describe the behavior @xmath157 in the @xmath156 limit . the relevant increase in @xmath158",
    "can remove the artifact(s ) occurred at low @xmath47 values .",
    "summing up , the extension of the three - site approximation by letting different @xmath38 values was capable to indicate the correct results of the more sophisticated approximation based on larger cluster of sites .",
    "we studied evolutionary prisoner s dilemma and stag hunt games on two representative two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the underlying structures were the square lattice and the kagome lattice exemplifying spatial connectivity structures without or with triangle percolation .",
    "we analyzed the simultaneous evolutions of strategy and a player specific noise parameter used by individuals in the strategy imitation processes .",
    "it turned out that players prefer to use the same distinguished noise level , namely the same way of strategy adoption and the fixed points of the adoption parameter are systematically close to those parameter values which are the most favorable for cooperation for the pd games .",
    "it implies that the evolution of the adoption parameter drives the population to a state which assures substantial cooperation within the coexistence region . in the region of sh game",
    "the maximum average payoff is achieved at the peripheries of the coexistence region .",
    "it is shown that in the latter case the darwinian selection favors the edge of coexistence region where the noise level ( @xmath0 ) is lower .",
    "the preference of the lower noise level can also be observed within the pd region because the distinguished rule @xmath60 was always smaller than that where the maximum average payoff ( or cooperator density ) occurs for homogeneous dynamical rules at fixed payoff .",
    "the above results raise many general questions about the main features of states ( including many aspects of the model itself ) favored by the darwinian selection . here",
    "we emphasize that the darwinian selection seems to be more efficient within the coexistence region where the simultaneous evolution of strategies accelerates the evolution of adoption rules , too .",
    "the latter observation is confirmed by simulations where the coexistence in maintained artificially by introducing rare mutations in the systems .",
    "the above investigations have required to improve the accuracy particularly in the low noise limit where the relaxation time diverges .",
    "the systematic investigation of the cooperator s density versus @xmath47 ( temptation to choose defection ) and @xmath0 have indicated different types of non - analytical behaviors in the limit @xmath159 and @xmath156 as figs .",
    "[ sqr_mc ] and [ kag_mc ] show . at the same time we found qualitatively similar behavior on both structures in the region of sh game .",
    "although most of these features can be reproduced qualitatively well by the dynamical cluster methods on sufficiently large cluster of sites , we think that further analysis is required to clarify the effects of the sucker s",
    "payoff @xmath1 , topology of connectivity network , and dynamics ( e.g. , when irrational choices are forbidden ) on the non - analytical behavior appeared here at @xmath124 and @xmath122 .",
    "the present investigations have expanded the research of coevolutionary game theory by applying darwinian selection among a continuous set of noise levels in dynamical rules used by the individuals while other relevant ingredients of the model were fixed . in most of the previous studies of the coevolutionary games",
    "only two ingredients of the system were allowed to evolve simultaneously .",
    "recently , van segbroeck _ et al . _ have studied a model where the players could modify three quantities : their strategy , connections , and the way how a new partner is chosen @xcite . in the light of the latter model",
    "one can ask what happens if the payoff parameter @xmath47 is also considered as an individual property ( @xmath160 ) and it can be adopted from the neighbors as well as the strategy @xmath161 and dynamical rule @xmath20 .",
    "the preliminary mc results have indicated that within the strategy coexistence region of the @xmath53 plane the system evolves toward @xmath55 with favoring smaller @xmath47 values .",
    "it is found that the system evolves fast toward a state where players use game of the lower @xmath47 value and subsequently the homogenization in @xmath20 will be done as described above .",
    "this means that the darwinian selection prefers sh to pd game , that is , the system develops an environment where the mutual cooperation ( providing the maximum average payoff ) can be achieved more conveniently .",
    "similar results were reported by worden and levin @xcite and also by fort @xcite who studied models with different adoptions of payoff parameters .",
    "evidently , other results can be obtained if the simultaneous evolution of the connectivity structure ( interaction and learning networks @xcite ) is also possible .    in principle , all the ingredients of the multi - agent coevolutionary games can be the subject of darwinian selection if we assume that these features are determined by the participants . in that case",
    "the system can evolve towards a strategy distribution with a proper connectivity structure , payoff parameter , adoption rule(s ) , mutation , _ etc .",
    "_ , that are preferred by the darwinian selection . as a consequence",
    "the given darwinian selection will show us the preferred features ( or parameter values ) we can fix when exploring the effect of other properties @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "the @xmath60 value(s ) can be suggested in numerical simulations if one wish to fix the noise level .",
    "finally we would like to mention that in many real systems besides the evolving individual s features there are external conditions affecting the system behavior .",
    "for example , the noise itself can arise from external sources as it was investigated by traulsen @xcite and perc @xcite .",
    "further systematic investigations are required to clarify the effect of the external noise or any other questions mentioned above .",
