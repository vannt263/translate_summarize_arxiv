    "this article is concerned with a topological quantity , the so - called _ fixed - point index _ of a homeomorphism of jordan curves , which has proven useful in the study of various areas of complex analysis .",
    "we begin with its definition :    a _ jordan curve _ is a homeomorphic image of a topological circle @xmath0 in the complex plane @xmath1 .",
    "jordan domain _ is a bounded open set in @xmath1 with jordan curve boundary .",
    "we use the term _ closed jordan domain _ or _ compact jordan domain _ to refer to the closure of a jordan domain .",
    "we define the _ positive orientation _ on a jordan curve as usual .",
    "that is , if @xmath2 is a closed jordan domain , then as we traverse @xmath3 in what we call the _ positive _ direction , the interior of @xmath2 stays to the left .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath4 be closed jordan domains .",
    "let @xmath5 be a homeomorphism of jordan curves which is fixed - point - free and orientation - preserving .",
    "we call such a homeomorphism _ indexable_. then @xmath6 is a closed curve in the plane which misses the origin .",
    "it has a natural orientation induced by traversing @xmath3 positively .",
    "then we define the _ fixed - point index _ of @xmath7 , denoted @xmath8 , to be the winding number of @xmath6 around the origin .",
    "two examples are shown in figures [ fig : ex disjoint then winding 0 ] and [ fig : ex neg winding forced ] .",
    "we remark that the fixed - point index depends crucially on the choice of homeomorphism , and also on the way that the sets @xmath2 and @xmath4 sit on top of each other .",
    "it is a worthwhile exercise to construct an indexable homeomorphism @xmath9 , for @xmath2 and @xmath4 as in figure [ fig : ex neg winding forced ] , having fixed - point index unequal to @xmath10 .",

    ", it has been applied to prove powerful existence , rigidity , and uniformization statements .",
    "most recently , the current author has used fixed - point index , including torus parametrization , to prove rigidity statements for collections of possibly - overlapping round disks , see .",
    "the fixed - point index measures the following topological quantity : suppose that @xmath2 and @xmath4 are closed jordan domains , and @xmath14 is a homeomorphism , having finitely many fixed points , which restricts to an indexable homeomorphism @xmath15 .",
    "there is a well - understood notion of the _ multiplicity _ of a fixed point of @xmath16 .",
    "then the fixed - point index @xmath17 counts the number of fixed - points of @xmath16 , with multiplicity . for more discussion along these lines , see @xcite*section 2 .    in this article , we describe a new technique for working with fixed - point index , which we call the _ torus parametrization _ of a pair of jordan curves , defined in section [ chap : torus ] .",
    "we apply torus parametrization to give a new , elementary proof of the following fundamental lemma :    [ threep ] [ 3p ] [ lem:3p ] [ lem : three points ] [ tppl ] let @xmath2 and @xmath4 be compact jordan domains in transverse position , with boundaries oriented positively .",
    "let @xmath18 appear in counterclockwise order , similarly @xmath19 .",
    "then there is an indexable homeomorphism @xmath5 sending @xmath20 for @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 .",
    "two jordan domains are in _ transverse position _ if their boundary jordan curves cross wherever they meet , c.f .  definition [ transverse position ] in section [ sec background ] . the example given in figure [ fig : ex neg winding forced ] shows that if we prescribe the images of four points , then a negative fixed - point index may be forced .",
    "a version of the three point prescription lemma [ threep ] is stated in @xcite*lemma 8.14 , but we have not been able to fill in the details of the argument .",
    "the idea of the approach is as follows : first , any riemann mapping @xmath23 between open jordan domains extends to a homeomorphism @xmath24 of their boundaries , and we may prescribe the images of three points of @xmath25 in @xmath26 by post - composing with self - biholomorphisms of @xmath27 .",
    "next , it is known that any isolated fixed point of a holomorphic map has non - negative multiplicity , see @xcite*section 2 .",
    "thus the map @xmath28 , if it is indexable , has non - negative fixed - point index , because the fixed - point index of @xmath28 counts the fixed points of @xmath16 with multiplicity , completing the argument .",
    "however , it is not clear how to deal with possible fixed points in the induced boundary map @xmath28 .",
    "our proof of lemma [ 3p ] uses only induction and plane topology arguments and is given in section [ sec:3p ] .",
    "we also state and prove a new fundamental lemma on fixed - point index , generalizing the well - known circle index lemma [ cil ] which states that the fixed - point index of an indexable homeomorphism between circles is always non - negative .",
    "the circle index lemma was a crucial ingredient in all of the applications of fixed - point index described above .",
    "in our generalization , round disks are replaced by closed jordan domains which do not disconnect each other . in particular",
    ", the closed jordan domains @xmath2 and @xmath4 are said to _ cut each other _ if @xmath29 or @xmath30 is disconnected . then :    [ no cut index ] let @xmath2 and @xmath4 be closed jordan domains in transverse position , which do not cut each other , having boundaries oriented positively .",
    "let @xmath31 be an indexable homeomorphism",
    ". then @xmath22 .",
    "the proof appears at the end of section [ incompat section ] .    as an example of the power of fixed - point index ,",
    "we apply the three point prescription lemma [ threep ] and lemma [ no cut index ] to prove a version of the incompatibility theorem of schramm @xcite*theorem 3.1 , as described in section [ incompat section ] .",
    "the incompatibility theorem is then easily applied in section [ cp proofs ] to prove some well - known rigidity theorems for circle packings .",
    "the ideas for these proofs are borrowed from .",
    "* acknowledgments . *",
    "thanks to jordan watkins for many fruitful discussions , especially for pointing us strongly in the direction of what we call _ torus parametrization_. thanks also to mario bonk for many fruitful discussions , especially for helpful suggestions that greatly simplified the proof of lemma [ no cut index ] .",
    "in the upcoming discussion it will be useful to have access to two well - known lemmas on fixed - point index .",
    "this section is devoted to introducing these two lemmas .",
    "our first background lemma says essentially that `` the fixed - point index between two circles is always non - negative '' :    [ cil ] [ lem : circle index lemma ] let @xmath2 and @xmath4 be closed jordan domains in @xmath1 , with boundaries oriented positively , and let @xmath5 be an indexable homeomorphism .",

    "2 .   if @xmath33 or @xmath34 , then @xmath35 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath2 and @xmath4 have disjoint interiors , then @xmath36 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath3 and @xmath37 intersect in exactly two points , then @xmath38 .    as a consequence of the above , if @xmath2 and @xmath4 are closed disks in the plane , then @xmath22 .",
    "lemma [ cil ] can be found in @xcite*lemma 2.2 , with a clear and complete proof .",
    "there it is indicated that a version of the lemma appeared earlier in @xcite .",
    "the moral of our second background lemma is that fixed - point indices `` add nicely '' :    [ lem : indices add ] [ additivity ] [ ial ] suppose that @xmath2 and @xmath39 are interiorwise disjoint closed jordan domains which meet along a single positive - length jordan arc @xmath40 , similarly for @xmath4 and @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 and @xmath43 are closed jordan domains .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be indexable homeomorphisms .",
