    "recently new experiments schuller07,rousseau07,schuller08,schuller2009  have shown interference effects also for grazing scattering of fast atoms from surfaces , where classical mechanics was supposed to be adequate .",
    "this unexpected diffraction phenomenon was found to be very sensitive to the description of the projectile - surface interaction schuller08,schuller2009,gravielle08,aigner08,schuller2009prb which opens the way for a method to probe surface potentials with high accuracy .",
    "the aim of this work is to find out to what extent surface potentials derived from state - of - art _ ab - initio _ methods are capable of reproducing experimental diffraction patterns for grazing scattering of swift he atoms from a lif(001 ) surface .",
    "the he - lif surface interaction is here derived by using the _ siesta _ @xcite implementation of the density - functional theory ( dft ) , which is a self - consistent method for performing first - principles calculations on systems with a large number of atoms .",
    "this dft method has been successfully used to study a variety of nanoscale problems @xcite . in order to describe the interference process",
    ", we employ a distorted - wave model - the surface eikonal approximation @xcite - using the eikonal wave function to represent the elastic collision with the surface , while the motion of the fast projectile is described classically by considering axially channeled trajectories for different initial conditions .",
    "the surface eikonal approximation is valid for small de broglie wavelengths of incident atoms , as considered here , which are several orders of magnitude smaller than the interatomic distances in the crystal .",
    "this method was shown to provide an adequate description of the interference effects for atoms colliding with insulator surfaces under axial surface channeling @xcite .",
    "eikonal projectile angular distributions derived from using the dft surface potential are compared with the experiment for different energies of incident projectiles . from this comparison",
    "we deduce the validity range of the potential model , which involves polarization and surface rumpling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental  method and the theoretical formalism are summarized in sec .",

    "in our experiments we have scattered neutral @xmath0he and @xmath1he atoms with kinetic energies @xmath2 ranging from 0.3 kev to 25 kev from a clean and flat lif(001 ) surface at room temperature under grazing angles of incidence @xmath3 deg .",
    "fast he@xmath4 ion beams were produced in a 10 ghz electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) ion source ( nanogan pantechnique , caen , france ) .",
    "the neutralization of the he@xmath4 ions was achieved via charge transfer in a gas cell mounted in the beam line of the accelerator operating with he gas and subsequent deflection of remaining charged fraction by an electric field .",
    "a base pressure of some 10@xmath5 mbar was achieved in our uhv chamber by a turbomolecular pump in series with a titanium sublimation pump , where the pressure gradient with respect to the beam line of the accelerator was maintained by two differential pumping stages .",
    "pairs of slits at both ends of these stages were used for the collimation of the incident beam to a divergence of @xmath6 .",
    "this high collimation is necessary for diffraction in order to maintain the degree of coherence in the scattering process from lif(001 ) .",
    "the lif(001 ) surface was prepared by cycles of grazing sputtering with 25 kev ar@xmath7 ions at @xmath8c where the ionic conductivity of lif is sufficiently enhanced in order to avoided macroscopic charging up and subsequent annealing to temperatures of about @xmath9c .",
    "the scattering experiments were performed in the regime of axial surface channeling , i.e the azimuthal setting of the surface plane was chosen so that the direction of the incident beam was parallel with atomic strings along low indexed directions in the surface plane .",
    "2d angular distributions of scattered projectiles were recorded by means of a commercially available position - sensitive multi - channelplate detector ( mcp ) with a delay - line anode ( dld40 , roentdek handels gmbh ) located 66 cm behind the target .",
    "this provides a simple and very efficient procedure for recording data where complete diffraction patterns as shown below can be recorded in a time of about minutes . since only about 10@xmath1 he atoms per second",
    "hit the target surface , fast atom diffraction is non - destructive and can be applied in studies on insulator surfaces ( neutral projectiles ) schuller07,rousseau07 , as well as adsorption phenomena at metal surfaces @xcite .    since aside from the absolute angular positions of diffraction spots , their relative intensities are important here , one has to carefully correct the recorded diffraction patterns with respect to inhomogeneities in the detection efficiency across the sensitive area of the mcp .",
    "this correction is performed by means of a wobbling technique where the projectile beam is scanned across the mcp active area with two orthogonal oriented electric fields using frequencies in the khz domain .",
    "when an atomic projectile ( @xmath10 ) impinges under grazing incidence on a crystal surface ( @xmath11 ) the t- matrix element associated with the elastic scattering can be defined in terms of the scattering state of the projectile , @xmath12 , as @xmath13where @xmath14 is the surface - projectile interaction , @xmath15denotes the position of the center of mass of the incident atom , and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , being the initial ( final ) unperturbed wave function and @xmath18 the initial ( final ) projectile momentum . taking into account that in the range of impact energies the de broglie wavelength of the incident projectile , @xmath19 , is sufficiently short compared to the characteristic distance of the surface potential , we approximate the scattering state @xmath20 by means of the eikonal - maslov wave function @xcite as follows @xmath21where @xmath22is the eikonal - maslov phase , which depends on the classical position of the incident atom @xmath23 at a given time @xmath24 .",

    "the surface potential was determined by performing first - principles calculations for the lif(001 ) surface .",

    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the ( 001 ) plane , and in order to prevent the interaction between images of the he atoms a @xmath42 supercell was considered in the ( 001 ) plane , giving a total of 112 + 1 atoms in the simulation box .",
    "we model the core electrons with norm - conserving pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type @xcite , describing valence electrons with numerical double-@xmath43 polarized atomic orbitals as the basis set .",
    "we explicitly included semicore states for li ( 1s@xmath44 ) in the valence band , and added two extra layers of `` ghost orbitals '' at the surface to increase the basis set description of the surface electronic wave - functions .",

    ", the distribution for scattered projectile lies inside an annulus of radius @xmath63 , presenting maxima symmetrically placed with respect to the incidence direction ( i.e. @xmath64 ) .",
    "the high intensity for the outermost peaks ( marked with lines ) is due to rainbow scattering under rainbow angle @xmath65 at maximal deflection , which can be explained classically . between the outer rainbow peaks further peaks",
    "show up , which can be explained as quantum mechanical diffraction effects in close analogy to the origin of supernumerary rainbows @xcite .",
    "supernumerary rainbows originate from quantum interference between projectiles that follow different classical pathways with the same final momentum .",
    "the order @xmath66 of a supernumerary corresponds to the multiple of @xmath67 in path length difference for constructive interference .",
    "the black dots in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] represent the theoretical positions of the maxima from the eikonal model , which closely agree with experimental data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] we show the intensity inside the annulus of radius @xmath68 from fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] as a function of the deflection angle @xmath69 , defined as @xmath70 .",
    "position and number of the supernumerary maxima are independent of @xmath2 at the same @xmath71 .",
    "similar structures are predicted by the eikonal model , although in the vicinity of the classical rainbow angle @xmath65 the relative intensity is overestimated .",
    "this is because the eikonal model is a semiclassical method based on classically calculated trajectories , showing a sharp maximum at the classical rainbow , where intensity increases sharply for @xmath72 and is zero for @xmath73 . in a more elaborate quantum treatment",
    "the classical rainbow peak will be replaced by a smoother maximum for @xmath74 at @xmath75 , with decaying intensity on the dark side of the classical rainbow @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath74 is the quantum surface rainbow \" @xcite .    just like in the experiment ,",
    "eikonal patterns as a function of the deflection angle @xmath77 are independent of @xmath2 at the same @xmath78 .",
    "this becomes more evident in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where deflection angles corresponding to supernumerary rainbows are plotted as a function of the total energy @xmath2 while keeping @xmath71 constant . even though @xmath79 takes into account the complete corrugation on the surface plane , without averaging the projectile - surface potential along the incidence direction , the eikonal projectile distribution is practically unaffected by the modulation of the potential along the channel .",
    "thus the differential probability @xmath80 is independent of @xmath81 for a given perpendicular energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the positions of supernumerary maxima are found to be extremely sensitive to the shape of the surface potential across the channel , especially for higher orders @xmath66 , which correspond to small deflection angles gravielle08,aigner08,schuller08,gravielle09 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show that the dft surface potential reproduces fairly well the angular positions of the supernumeraries .",
    "different perpendicular energies @xmath71 probe a different @xmath50-range of @xmath14 . to investigate in detail the atom - surface potential across the @xmath82 channel , in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] we plot the angular positions of maxima of the experimental distribution as a function of @xmath83 ranging from 0.03 to 3 ev . in this case @xmath84he isotopes are used as projectiles . for low perpendicular energies , i.e. @xmath85 1 ev , the experimental spectra show maxima at bragg angles @xmath86 , which fulfill the condition @xmath87@xmath88 being the width of the channel , @xmath89 the diffraction order , and @xmath90 the de broglie wavelength associated with the perpendicular motion . as discussed in ref.@xcite , interference patterns for grazing scattering stem from two different mechanisms .",
    "the first one , associated with the supernumerary rainbows , is produced by the interference of trajectories whose initial positions @xmath91 differ by a distance smaller than @xmath88 , carrying information on the shape of the interaction potential across the channel .",
    "the second one originates from the interference of trajectories whose initial positions @xmath92 are separated by the spacial lattice periodicity @xmath88 resulting in bragg peaks \" providing information on the spacing between surface atoms . whether a bragg peak shows intensity or not depends on the position of the supernumeraries .",
    "the bragg peak of order @xmath89 which is closest to the angular position of a supernumerary of order @xmath66 is intense .",
    "since the bragg angles @xmath93 decrease with @xmath71 while the angular position of the supernumeraries increases , the order @xmath89 of the intense bragg peak increases successively .",
    "signatures of both interference processes can be observed in the simulated spectrum  also . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the eikonal probability @xmath80 is plotted as a function of the deflection angle for @xmath71 = 0.5 ev . from eq .",
    "( [ teikn ] ) when the initial projectile position @xmath28 is integrated over a unit cell , supernumerary maxima are only present inthe angular projectile distribution .",
    "but when the integration area is extended to include the first order nearest neighbor target ions , the eikonal spectrum displays internal structures in the supernumerary maxima , which are due to resolved bragg peaks .    since we are interested in studying the modulation of the potential inside an unit cell , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] eikonal curves corresponding to the center of supernumerary maxima , neglecting the bragg interference that appears as a superimposed structure at low perpendicular energies .",
    "the eikonal curves obtained by using the dft atom - surface interaction follow closely the experimental results for supernumeraries @xmath94 to @xmath95 with only slight deviations for the quantum rainbow @xmath74 at low @xmath83 .",
    "supernumerary rainbows are sensitive to the corrugation of the equipotential surfaces but not to their positions .",
    "each potential with the same effective corrugation along the @xmath60 direction would agree as well . in order to show that the potential is unique",
    ", one has to compare the theoretical results with the experiment for a further ( different ) channeling direction .",
    "the potential would be unique only if the same potential describes the supernumeraries here as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] we show a comparison of experimental supernumerary rainbows with eikonal results for scattering of @xmath84he along a @xmath96 direction of lif(001 ) .",
    "the eikonal curves with dft potential agree with the experimental values except for @xmath74 at low energies @xmath97 1.0 ev .",
    "we point out again that the eikonal approximation is a semi - classical theory which fails in the vicinity of the classical rainbow @xmath65 .",
    "the angular position of the quantum rainbow @xmath74 is smaller than the classical rainbow angle @xmath65 when @xmath98 becomes large @xcite . since the intensity at @xmath65",
    "is overestimated the peak maximum @xmath74 is shifted to larger deflection angles at lower @xmath71 . for a correct description of the intensity at @xmath65",
    "a uniform approximation \" @xcite is necessary , but supernumeraries are not affected by this deviation . since the positions of the supernumeraries agree well in both channeling directions and since a change of the corrugation of the he - lif(001 ) interaction potential by 0.02   induces a clear shift in the position of the supernumeraries schuller08,gravielle09 ,",
    "we conclude that the dft he - lif(001 ) potential is accurate .    by employing the hard - wall model from garibaldi _",
    "garibaldi1975 valid for sinusoidal small corrugated potential surfaces we obtain good agreement as well .",
