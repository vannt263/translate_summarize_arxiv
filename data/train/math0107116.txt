    "let @xmath0 be a right - angled bounded convex polytope in hyperbolic space @xmath6 , and let @xmath2 be the group generated by reflections across codimension - one faces .",
    "for any torsion - free subgroup @xmath7 of finite index , the quotient @xmath4 is a closed hyperbolic manifold which is an orbifold cover of @xmath0 .",
    "we call this manifold a _ small cover of @xmath0 _ ( as in @xcite ) if the index of @xmath5 is minimal",
    ". examples of small covers include the first closed hyperbolic @xmath8-manifold to appear in the literature @xcite as well as its generalizations @xcite .",
    "the point of this note is to show that if @xmath0 is regular then any small cover of @xmath0 is uniquely determined up to isometry ( and up to homeomorphism when @xmath9 ) by @xmath5 ( modulo symmetries of @xmath0 ) .",
    "in fact , there are only two right - angled regular hyperbolic polytopes with dimension @xmath10 , the dodecahedron and the @xmath1-cell .",
    "we conclude the paper by showing that up to homeomorphism there are exactly @xmath11 small covers of the dodecahedron , and that there is a unique small cover of the @xmath1-cell with minimal complexity ( in the sense of section  [ s : examples ] , below ) .",
    "there are other hyperbolic manifolds based on the dodecahedron @xcite and the @xmath1-cell @xcite appearing in the literature , but these are obtained by identifying faces of a single copy of the polytope and require that it have dihedrals angles of @xmath12 .",
    "analogous constructions fail for right - angled realizations of these polytopes , and small covers provide a natural alternative .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath13-dimensional right - angled convex polytope in @xmath6 , and let @xmath14 denote the set of facets ( i.e. , codimension - one faces ) of @xmath0 .",
    "for each @xmath15 , we let @xmath16 denote the reflection across @xmath17 , and we let @xmath2 be the group generated by @xmath18 . defining relations for @xmath2 are @xmath19 for all @xmath17 and @xmath20 whenever @xmath21 .",
    "following @xcite , we call an epimorphism @xmath22 a _ characteristic function _ if whenever @xmath23 are facets that all meet at a vertex , the images @xmath24 form a @xmath25-basis",
    ".    if @xmath5 is a torsion free subgroup of @xmath2 , then its index is @xmath26 .",
    "if the index is equal to @xmath27 , then @xmath5 is normal and is the kernel of a characteristic function @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the reflection tiling of @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath28 is a codimension-@xmath29 cell in this tiling , then there are exactly @xmath30 maximal cells containing @xmath28 , and the stabilizer @xmath31 is isomorphic to @xmath32 . if @xmath5 is torsion - free , then the natural map @xmath33 must be injective ; hence , the index of @xmath5 is at least @xmath27 .",
    "if the index is equal to @xmath27 , then for any @xmath34-cell @xmath35 , the map @xmath36 is a bijection .",
    "we let @xmath37 be the composition @xmath38 it is not _ a priori _ a homomorphism , but since the defining relations for @xmath2 also hold for the images @xmath39 , there is an induced epimorphism @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 , for all @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath37 and @xmath43 agree on all but one element in the stabilizer of a cell , then they must also agree on the entire stabilizer .",
    "using this fact and the fact that @xmath37 and @xmath43 agree on the generators of @xmath2 , it follows that @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 is an epimorphism and @xmath5 is its kernel .",
    "that @xmath37 is a characteristic function follows from the fact that @xmath45 must be a bijection _ for every @xmath35_.    let @xmath22 be a characteristic function , and let @xmath46 .",
    "the _ small cover of @xmath0 associated to @xmath37 _ is the closed hyperbolic manifold @xmath47 .",
    "small covers are functorial in the following sense .",
    "[ prop : subface ] let @xmath48 be a small cover of @xmath0 . for any face @xmath17 of @xmath0 , let @xmath49 be the hyperbolic subspace spanned by @xmath17 and let @xmath50 be the image of @xmath51 in @xmath48 ( that is , @xmath52 ) . then @xmath50 is a totally geodesic submanifold which is itself a small cover of the face @xmath17 .",
    "the stabilizer @xmath53 fixes @xmath51 pointwise and is mapped isomorphically by @xmath37 onto a codimension-@xmath29 subspace @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 ) .",
    "each facet of @xmath17 can be expressed uniquely as the intersection @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a facet of @xmath0 that is orthogonal to @xmath17 , and we let @xmath58 denote the subgroup of @xmath2 generated by the corresponding reflections @xmath59 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath37 induces a characteristic function @xmath60 for the polytope @xmath17 with kernel @xmath61 .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) denote the symmetry group of @xmath0 , and let @xmath65 .",
    "we say that two small covers @xmath48 and @xmath66 are _ equivalent _ if @xmath67 for some @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "any small cover @xmath48 has a natural ( totally geodesic ) cell decomposition induced by the tiling of @xmath6 .    [",
    "prop : equivalence ] two small covers @xmath48 and @xmath66 are equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic as cell complexes .",
    "it is clear that equivalent small covers are isomorphic as cell complexes .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath70 is an isomorphism of cell complexes .",
    "then the lift @xmath71 is an automorphism of the tiling of @xmath6 such that @xmath72 .",
    "since the automorphism group of the tiling is a semi - direct product of @xmath2 and @xmath63 , there exists an @xmath68 such that @xmath73 for some element @xmath74 .",
    "it follows that @xmath75 ( they are both normal ) , hence @xmath67 for some @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a right - angled hyperbolic polytope as above .",
    "@xmath0 is _ regular _ if its symmetry group acts transitively on the simplices in its barycentric subdivision .",
    "any such simplex must be a hyperbolic coxeter simplex , and by examining the standard list of these simplices ( bourbaki @xcite , p. 133 ) one can show that @xmath0 must be either a polygon with @xmath76 sides , the dodecahedron , or the ( @xmath77-dimensional ) @xmath1-cell .",
    "an important property of these regular polytopes is the following :    [ lem : connectingpath ] let @xmath0 be a regular right - angled hyperbolic polytope , and let @xmath78 be the length of an edge in @xmath0 .",
    "then any path in @xmath0 that connects non - adjacent facets has length @xmath79 with equality holding only if the connecting path is an edge of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath80 be a connecting path with endpoints lying on the ( disjoint ) facets @xmath17 and @xmath57 . because @xmath0 is regular",
    ", it has a `` cubical '' decomposition obtained by cutting each edge with the orthogonal hyperplane through its midpoint ( see figure  [ fig : pminpath.fig ] ) .",
    "we define two open neighborhoods @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the facet @xmath17 as follows .",
    "@xmath81 is the union of the interiors of all cubes that intersect @xmath17 , and @xmath82 is the set of all points of @xmath0 whose distance to @xmath17 is less than @xmath83 .",
    "we claim that @xmath84 . to see this",
    ", it suffices to note that if @xmath85 is an edge meeting @xmath17 othogonally at a vertex and @xmath86 is the hyperplane bisecting @xmath85 , then @xmath82 lies entirely on one side of @xmath86 ( since the edge @xmath85 , being a common perpendicular to @xmath86 and @xmath17 , realizes the shortest distance between the corresponding hyperplanes ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the corresponding neighborhoods of @xmath57 , we have @xmath89 . since @xmath17 and @xmath57 are not adjacent , @xmath90 and , hence , @xmath91 .",
    "this means @xmath92 and since the edge @xmath85 is the _",
    "unique _ path of minimal length joining @xmath17 to @xmath86 , the equality @xmath93 is only possible if @xmath80 is an edge of @xmath0 .    to see that the lemma can fail without the regularity hypothesis ,",
    "let @xmath0 be any right - angled @xmath13-dimensional polytope and let @xmath94 be a minimal length edge . by gluing @xmath95 copies of @xmath0 together around the edge @xmath85 ,",
    "one obtains a right - angled polytope @xmath96 with @xmath85 now being an interior connecting path that is as short as any edge of @xmath96 .",
    "we are now in a position to prove the main theorem .",
    "the argument is based on the fact that an isometry must preserve the set of minimal length closed geodesics . to simplify the exposition , we call a closed geodesic in a small cover an _ edge loop _ if it is of the form @xmath97 ( proposition  [ prop : subface ] ) for some edge @xmath94 .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath13-dimensional right - angled regular hyperbolic polytope .",
    "then two small covers of @xmath0 are isometric if and only if they are equivalent .",
    "first we show that if @xmath98 is any small cover of @xmath0 , then any closed geodesic of minimal length must be an edge loop .",
    "let @xmath80 be a closed geodesic in @xmath98 , and let @xmath17 be a codimension - one cell in @xmath98 that intersects @xmath80 transversely .",
    "lifting @xmath80 to the universal cover @xmath6 , we obtain a geodesic segment @xmath99 that connects two lifts @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the cell @xmath17 ( see figure  [ fig : ucover.fig ] ) .",
    "let @xmath102 and @xmath103 be the hyperplanes spanned by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . since @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "are both mapped to the face @xmath17 under the projection @xmath104 , they are hyperparallel , thus have a ( unique ) common perpendicular @xmath105 . moreover , @xmath105 must pass through at least two copies of the tile @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ lem : connectingpath ] that the length of @xmath105 is @xmath106 with equality holding only if @xmath105 is the lift of an edge .",
    "since the geodesic @xmath99 is at least as long as @xmath105 with equality holding only if @xmath107 , the closed geodesic @xmath80 will have minimal length only if it is an edge loop .",
    "now suppose @xmath70 is an isometry . since @xmath108 takes minimal length closed geodesics to minimal length closed goedesics , it must take edge loops to edge loops",
    ". the @xmath34-cells in a small cover can be characterized as the points where edge loops intersect , thus @xmath108 must take @xmath34-cells to @xmath34-cells and , therefore , @xmath109-cells to @xmath109-cells . since any cell of dimension @xmath110 in a small cover can be characterized as the convex hull of its bounding @xmath109-cells , the isometry @xmath108 must take cells to cells .",
    "thus , by proposition  [ prop : equivalence ] , @xmath48 and @xmath66 are equivalent .",
    "mostow rigidity gives the following :    if @xmath0 is the dodecahedron or the @xmath1-cell , then two small covers of @xmath0 are homeomorphic if and only if they are equivalent .",
    "in this section , we describe an algorithm for enumerating equivalence classes of small covers for general @xmath0 , and apply it to the dodecahedron and @xmath1-cell .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm becomes unfeasible for the @xmath1-cell , so instead we apply it to a restricted class of characteristic functions .    * the algorithm .",
    "* let @xmath0 be @xmath13-dimensional , and let @xmath111 be any ordering of the facets such that the first @xmath13 facets @xmath23 all meet at a vertex .",
    "given any characteristic function @xmath22 , we let @xmath112 be the image @xmath113 of the fundamental reflection across the @xmath114th facet . by definition",
    "a @xmath115-tuple @xmath116 determines a characteristic function if and only if the @xmath112 s corresponding to facets meeting at a vertex form a basis for @xmath117 .",
    "we call such a @xmath118 a _ labeling of @xmath0 _ and each @xmath112 a _ label_. we say a labeling is _ normalized _ if the first @xmath13 labels form the standard basis for @xmath117 , and we let @xmath119 denote the set of normalized labelings of @xmath0",
    ". the following algorithm determines @xmath119 .      1 .",
    "assume by induction that @xmath123 have been chosen , and let @xmath124 be the list @xmath121 with all elements of the following form removed : @xmath125 where that @xmath126 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath129 we know that there are no ( unrecorded ) labelings that begin @xmath130 . in this case , we back up until we find a nonempty @xmath131 with @xmath132 ( and @xmath133 as large as possible ) .",
    "we let @xmath134 be the first element in @xmath135 and go back to step 1 , using @xmath133 instead of @xmath114 . if @xmath136 , we let @xmath137 be the first element in the list @xmath124 and remove it from @xmath124 . if @xmath138 , we go back to step 1 , using @xmath139 instead of @xmath114 . if @xmath140 , we add the full labeling @xmath118 to @xmath119 and repeat step 2 .",
    "the group of symmetries @xmath141 acts on @xmath119 , and the equivalence classes of small covers are in bijection with @xmath141-orbits . to determine these orbits , we choose a set of generators for @xmath141 and form the graph whose vertices are elements of @xmath119 and whose edges join any pair of vertices that differ by a generator of @xmath141",
