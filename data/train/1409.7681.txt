    "a typical example is the metric space obtained by gluing together euclidean ( respectively hyperbolic ) triangles .",

    "the following inequality holds : @xmath13    inequalities , respectively hold for all euclidean , respectively hyperbolic metrics on a disk , as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequalities in the euclidean , respectively hyperbolic , plane .",
    "therefore theorem [ thm : main ] is implied by the following proposition .",
    "[ prp : elimcone ] for every euclidean or hyperbolic cone - metric @xmath2 on @xmath8 such that all cone points have negative curvatures there is a euclidean , respectively hyperbolic , metric on @xmath8 with the same perimeter and larger area .",
    "stronger versions of proposition [ prp : elimcone ] and theorem [ thm : main ] were proved by a.  d.  alexandrov , see section [ sec : alex ] below .",
    "the aim of the present article is to give a new proof that is simple and in some sense conceptually attractive .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] can be viewed as the discrete analog of the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : weil ] for every riemannian metric on a disk @xmath8 with the gauss curvature @xmath14 the euclidean isoperimetric inequality holds .    for every riemannian metric on a disk @xmath8 with @xmath15 the hyperbolic isoperimetric inequality holds .",
    "the first part was proved independently by weil @xcite and beckenbach and rad @xcite .",
    "the second part is due to bol @xcite .",
    "aubin @xcite conjectured that a similar result holds in higher dimensions : a simply connected @xmath16-manifold of non - positive sectional curvature satisfies the isoperimetric inequality of @xmath17 .",
    "later the conjecture was extended to metrics with sectional curvature bounded by @xmath18 , replacing @xmath17 by the space - form of curvature @xmath19 . as for now ,",
    "only the cases @xmath20 for any @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath21 for @xmath22 @xcite are verified .",
    "see @xcite for a novel approach and new partial results .",
    "a.  d.  alexandrov s stronger version of theorem [ thm : main ] is @xmath23 where the cone - surface is allowed to have singularities of positive curvature , @xmath24 denotes the sum of all positive curvatures , and @xmath25 stands for the curvature of the model space ( @xmath26 in the euclidean and @xmath27 in the hyperbolic case ) .",
    "alexandrov s method consists in repeated cutting of the surface along piecewise geodesics paths and gluing in polygonal regions along the cuts .    by approximation , inequality ( with @xmath24 duly defined in dependence on @xmath25 ) holds for all metrics of _ bounded integral curvature _ , a broad class introduced by alexandrov , that includes both riemannian and cone - metrics .",
    "the equality holds only if @xmath3 is a circular neighborhood of the apex of a cone",
    ". see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) for more details and references .",
    "in particular , this generalizes the inequality @xmath28 proved first by fiala @xcite for analytic riemannian metrics of positive gauss curvature .",
    "weil s proof of the first part of theorem [ thm : weil ] goes as follows .",
    "a metric with non - positive gauss curvature uniformizes with a subharmonic conformal factor : @xmath29 where the metric @xmath30 is flat .",
    "a harmonic function that coincides with @xmath31 on @xmath32 minorizes @xmath31 : @xmath33 hence for a flat metric @xmath34 we have @xmath35 where the integration is done with respect to the area element of @xmath30 . thus the theorem is reduced to the isoperimetric problem in the euclidean plane ( if one is able to deal with possible self - overlaps of the development of @xmath36 onto @xmath37 ) .      in section [ sec : triang ]",
    "we show that every euclidean or hyperbolic cone - surface ( independently of its topological type and curvature signs ) can be geodesically triangulated without adding unnecessary vertices .",
    "namely , all interior vertices of the triangulation are cone - points , and one is allowed to add a vertex on a boundary component if it is geodesic , that is contains no angle points .    in section [ sec",
    ": deform ] we explain how to deform the edge lengths in such a minimal triangulation of a negatively curved cone - surface so that its area increases and one of the interior singularities disappears . by iterating this step , taking each time a new triangulation with fewer vertices , we arrive to a metric without cone points that has a larger area and the same perimeter as the initial cone - metric .",
    "this proves proposition [ prp : elimcone ] and hence theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "the basic deformation step is a special elongation of all edges incident to some interior vertex .",
    "this can be viewed as a discrete analog of a conformal deformation with non - negative factor . in this",
    "respect our method resembles weil s argument from the previous section .",
    "note that a different discrete analog of conformal deformations was proposed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 be a euclidean or hyperbolic cone - surface , possibly with boundary .",
    "a _ geodesic triangulation _ of @xmath38 is a decomposition of @xmath3 into euclidean , respectively hyperbolic , triangles with disjoint interiors such that every side of every triangle is either contained in the boundary of @xmath3 or glued to another side of another or the same triangle .",
    "clearly , the vertex set of a geodesic triangulation contains the singular locus of @xmath2 .",
    "every cone - surface can be geodesically triangulated .",
    "the main result of this section is proposition [ prp : triangsurf ] , which implies the existence of a _ minimal _ triangulation , that is one all of whose vertices are singular points of the metric , with addition of one extra vertex on every geodesic component of the boundary .",
    "( if @xmath3 is closed and has no cone points , then one has to add a non - singular vertex in the interior . )",
    "the result is probably not new , but we could nt find a reference .",
    "an analogous statement is false in dimension  @xmath39 , see remark [ rem : triang3 ] .    by a _",

    "then there exists a geodesic triangulation of @xmath38 with the vertex set @xmath42 .    if @xmath44 , then create a boundary by cutting @xmath3 along any simple geodesic arc with the endpoints , and only them , in @xmath42 . to show that such a geodesic exists , one can use the exponential map based at a point @xmath45 .",

    "consider the exponential map @xmath86 , restricted to the interior of the angle at @xmath76 .",
    "if at some radius @xmath87 it ceases to be injective , then we either find a simple interior geodesic of length @xmath87 ending at a cone point of positive curvature , or we find a simple closed geodesic of length @xmath88 based at @xmath76 .",
