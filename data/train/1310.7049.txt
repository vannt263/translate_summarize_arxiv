    "m_(r ) @xmath12 , where a shallowing of the luminosity function is a possible signature of collisional evolution of the kuiper belt @xcite , comparatively little attention has been paid to the luminosity function of the largest objects .",
    "accretion models @xcite predict the slope of the kbo size distribution should continue smoothly to the brightest object .",
    "measurement of the luminosity function at the bright end ( _ m_(r)@xmath022 ) should thus provide strong constraints on these accretionary theories , but in fact , the luminosity function of the brightest kbos is not as well known .",
    "this seemingly surprising situation is a result of the fact that in order to find the few large and bright ( _ m_(r)@xmath3 22 ) kbos wide - field surveys cover several thousands of square degrees over a wide range of conditions making precise photometric and detection efficiency calibration difficult .",
    "previous attempts have been made at constructing the large kbo luminosity function .",
    "@xcite found the large kbos ( _ m_(r)@xmath0 21 ) follow a single function with the same slope measured by @xcite at fainter magnitudes ( smaller sizes ) , but made no attempt to calculate the detection efficiencies that would be required to absolutely calibrate the brightness distribution of the large kbos and compare the absolute number of objects to that measured at smaller sizes .",
    "more recently @xcite examined the cumulative number of kbos as a function of absolute magnitude for all known kbos and their survey discoveries but make no attempt to correct for detection losses and survey biases .",
    "thus , the luminosity function of the brightest and largest kbos ( _ m_(r)@xmath0 22 ) has not been properly joined with that observed at fainter magnitudes ( smaller sizes ) nor their absolute numbers compared .",
    "@xcite have provided the largest wide field survey to date with detections of these bright objects , moderately accurate photometric calibration , and an empirically determined efficiency function . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xcite survey combined with available published surveys , to make the first attempt at constructing a complete luminosity function of the kuiper belt from the brightest objects to _ m_(r)@xmath13 and compare the brightness distribution obtained for the largest and brightest kbos ( _ m_(r)@xmath022 ) to that measured for smaller fainter kbos .",
    "no single survey to date has the sky coverage and depth to detect a sufficient number of objects for which the brightness distribution could be accurately measured over @xmath14 range .",
    "accurately constructing the luminosity function across this magnitude range requires careful selection of comparison surveys to combine , objects within the surveys to include , and correction of each survey to a common system .",
    "first we must select the objects to include in our luminosity function .",
    "observations find that the luminosity function differs for dynamically cold classical kbos ( defined as _ i _",
    "@xmath0 5@xmath15 orbits ) and dynamically excited or ` hot ' orbits ( _ i _ @xmath1 5@xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the cold classicals are a set of exclusively red objects in low inclination , low eccentricity orbits with semimajor axes between about 42 and 48 au , @xcite that appear to be a physically distinct population with physical and dynamical characteristics ( including color and binary fraction ) distinct from the rest of the kbo population @xcite .",
    "the cold classical size range is also smaller than that of the dynamically excited kbos @xcite .",
    "the cold population lacks objects brighter than _ m_(r)=21.5 , with nearly all the largest and brightest kbos being members of the dynamically excited or hot kbo population .",
    "therefore we restrict our analysis to the hot population only , ignoring the cold classical kuiper belt .    for the analysis described in this paper , we define our hot or excited kbo population , which we will refer to as the ` hot population ' , as those objects with inclinations greater than 5 degrees and discovered at barycentric distances greater than 25 au .",
    "we use the dynamical boundary at 5 degrees inclination found by @xcite to exclude the majority of cold classical orbits .",
    "we note that there is observational evidence suggesting a break in the color distribution of the classical belt , separating red objects and more varied in color bodies , at a higher inclination of @xmath412 degrees @xcite .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy between the inclination distribution and the color distribution has yet to be resolved.the low - inclination peak due to the cold classicals in the inclination distribution is very well defined , and we therefore use this as the basis to remove cold classicals from the survey detections . while many surveys do not perform sufficient astrometric follow - up to precisely determine orbital parameters , even two - night observations are sufficient to determine the inclination and of a minor planet to moderate accuracy .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to surveys where the majority of the detected kbos have observed arcs of at least 24 hours in order to securely identify the hot kbos with little contamination .",
    "we also exclude the much closer centaur population from our luminosity function .",
    "while the centaurs are derived from the kuiper belt , their much closer distances would allow small objects to contaminate the luminosity function of the brightest kbos .",
    "like inclination , heliocentric distance is also well - determined in short observations arcs .",
    "we thus include in our sample only objects discovered at heliocentric distances greater than 25 au where the majority of the determined orbits will be beyond neptune .",
    "next , we must select appropriate surveys to combine in order to assemble our luminosity function .",
    "the number density of kbos changes with ecliptic longitude .",
    "this variation is primarily due to the plutinos , bodies residing in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with neptune .",
    "a large concentration of plutinos have orbits that come to perihelion at approximately 40 - 140 degrees ahead of and behind neptune .",
    "surveys observing at those ecliptic longitudes are biased towards the detection of these preferentially closer , thus brighter , objects . for deep pencil - beam surveys which search only a few square degrees over a narrow range of ecliptic longitudes",
    "this detection enhancement could be significant when binning into a cumulative magnitude distribution , especially for _ m_(r)@xmath0 22 where small numbers of non - resonant hot kbos are expected .",
    "then extrapolating from these surveys to full - sky would overestimate the number of kbos as a function of magnitude . to properly account for these variations in sky density",
    "would require both simultaneously solving for the absolute magnitude and radial distribution for each of these surveys , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but for surveys searching several hundreds to thousands of square degrees , this effect is mitigated by the large swath of sky surveyed .",
    "they cover much more area where the majority of plutinos are not coming to perihelia and biased towards detection .",
    "plutinos will be a very small fraction of the surveys overall detections , and thus correction is generally negligible for surveys of such sizes .",
    "when extrapolating to the full - sky , these wide - field surveys will do a much better job at reflecting the true numbers of kbos .",
    "thus we restrict our survey sample to those that cover @xmath1 100 deg@xmath16 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of each survey selected for the analysis presented here . while the @xcite and @xcite surveys are the only wide - field surveys that include an estimate of an efficiency function , for comparison we also include the surveys of and @xcite which have published detection lists and each found a significant number of objects brighter than _ m_(r)=21 .",
    "for kbos fainter than _ m_(r)=22 , we use @xcite which is the only survey that fits our selection criteria detecting moderately sized kbos with a high recovery rate and well - characterized detection efficiency . in order to consistently calibrate the luminosity function , we restrict @xcite to those observations within a few degrees of the ecliptic , excluding the two survey blocks observed at 10 and 20 degrees off the ecliptic . @xcite",
    "determine the detection losses of each of their fields separately .",
    "we take their nominal survey efficiency to be the average detection efficiency of all the fields searched .",
    "in the following section we compute the hot kbo luminosity function and determine whether there is a match in sky density between 20@xmath0_m_(r)@xmath023 kbos predicted by @xcite to that measured at the the bright end , _",
    "m_(r)@xmath022 , from the surveys .",
    "we choose to assemble the luminosity function based upon apparent magnitude rather than absolute magnitude or estimate a size distribution ( with an assumption for albedo ) .",
    "the detection efficiencies and limiting magnitudes for our sample surveys are all measured in terms of a flux limit . the absolute magnitude ( or size )",
    "that a survey is sensitive to depends on the distance to the body .",
    "the hot population covers a much wider radial distance , ranging from 25 au to approximately 100 au , than the cold classicals where a mean distance of 42 au is typically assumed to convert from the luminosity function to a size or absolute magnitude distribution . to correctly calibrate each survey in our sample in terms of absolute magnitude",
    "would require knowing the full radial and orbital distribution of the hot population .",
    "therefore we choose to avoid these complexities and simply use the apparent magnitudes which are a convolution of the hot population s radial , size , and albedo distributions .",
    "our survey sample ( listed in table 1 ) observes in a variety of different filters ; we choose the r filter as our common magnitude reference system . for the @xcite survey ,",
    "each kbo was imaged four times , twice each night , and the apparent magnitude is taken to be the median of the four observations .",
    "we find an average @xmath0v@xmath17r@xmath1 color of 0.54 for multiopposition hot population kbos ( _ a _",
    "@xmath1 30 au and _ i _",
    "@xmath1 5@xmath15 ) in the mboss databaseohainaut / mboss/ ] .",
    "we use the magnitude transformation @xmath0g@xmath18@xmath17",
    "r@xmath1 = 0.8 used by @xcite to transform their pre - survey detections r to g .",
    "we apply these values as our constant offset to transform the reported survey apparent magnitudes to r band .",
    "the and @xcite surveys both use the broadband rg610 filter , a broadband vr filter . using the magnitude transformations provided by @xcite , we find a small average offset of @xmath0vr@xmath17r@xmath1= 0.02 , and we choose to apply no offset to these surveys reported magnitudes .    for each survey , we compile the differential luminosity function , the number of kbos as a function of apparent magnitude binned in 0.25 mag bins up to their limiting magnitudes . for @xcite , we account for the survey losses by dividing by the reported detection efficiency in each magnitude bin . for @xcite ,",
    "we correct for detection losses by simply dividing by the nominal survey detection efficiency .",
    "additionally , @xcite only report the objects that were successfully tracked in follow - up observations , and we account for their magnitude dependent recovery rate by dividing by the reported follow - up efficiency at each magnitude bin . as no efficiency is reported , we make no correction for and @xcite .",
    "we then assemble the differential luminosity function into a cumulative distribution at 0.25 magnitude intervals .",
    "error bars are then taken as the poissonian 68@xmath19 uncertainty ( as prescribed by @xcite @xcite ) for the value of the cumulative distribution in each magnitude bin .    to directly compare the brightness distributions from each survey in our sample , we require a common reference sky coverage to account for observational biases caused by the on - sky density of kbos varying with ecliptic latitude .",
    "we select the sky coverage of @xcite , because the survey covers the most sky in our sample with published estimates of detection efficiency .",
    "@xcite searched 11,786 deg@xmath16 down to a mean limiting r magnitude of @xmath421.3 , within @xmath2030@xmath15 of the ecliptic .",
    "for further details about the survey and calibration , we refer the reader to @xcite .    for the remaining surveys in our sample ,",
    "we calculate the number of objects that would have been found had they searched the same sky coverage as @xcite .",
    "@xcite targeted fields well off ecliptic , but @xcite , , and @xcite observed fields at less than 10 degrees ecliptic latitude . if kbos were uniformly distributed latitudinally , the total number of objects expected within the @xcite survey region would simply be the number density found at the ecliptic multiplied by @xcite s areal coverage ( 11,786 deg@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the number of kbos varies as a function of distance from the ecliptic , and we must account for that .",
    "we compute the correction from a flat distribution using the latitude distribution derived , by @xcite scaled to fit the observed @xcite folded latitude distribution . making an approximation for circular orbits , l(@xmath21 )",
    ", the number of kbos as a function of absolute ecliptic latitude ( @xmath21 ) is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is inclination,@xmath24 is 15@xmath15for the hot kbos .",
    "the @xcite observed folded latitude distribution binned in 2 degree bins and @xmath25 scaled to the observed distribution are plotted in figure [ fig : lat ] .",
    "@xcite observes a spike in detections at @xmath2610 degrees that is not present in @xmath25 .",
    "these peaks were hypothesized by @xcite and @xcite to be enhanced detections of the subset of plutinos locked in the kozai resonance .",
    "with only 3 of the 33 @xcite sample kbos identified as potential kozai plutinos and modeling of the kozai plutino population by @xcite not reproducing a spike at those ecliptic latitudes , the excess in the 11 - 13 degree bin may be due to small - number statistics .",
    "we thus chose to use the @xcite latitude distribution shown in figure [ fig : lat ] without an additional component at 11 - 13 degrees .",
    "we find that the total number of objects in the area of the @xcite survey should scale as the number density found at the ecliptic multiplied by the areal coverage of the @xcite survey multiplied by a scaling factor of 0.69 . while the precise value of this scaling is uncertain , the scaling itself is modest , so the precise value has only a small effect on the final results .",
    "the @xcite , , and @xcite density measurements are not strictly equatorial , but the latitude distribution below 10 degrees is essentially flat , so to transform these distributions to the @xcite sky coverage , we scale for the difference in sky coverage between @xcite and the respective surveys and apply the standard 0.69 scaling factor to the distribution and uncertainties in each magnitude bin .",
    "we note the errors induced by the assumed hot population latitude distribution will affect all the corrected brightness distributions equally and therefore not change the relative difference between these surveys .",
    "we first examine the brightness distribution of the large kbos ( _ m_(r)@xmath0 22 ) obtained from @xcite , , and @xcite . figure [ fig : wide ] plots the number of hot population kbos brighter than or equal to a given apparent r magnitude present in the @xcite survey region binned in 0.25 mag bins for all three shallow wide - field surveys .",
    "all three surveys are photometrically calibrated to the usno catalogs and the uncertainty in their measured magnitudes is approximately @xmath20 0.3 mag @xcite , which could at most shift the cumulative luminosity function by a magnitude bin in either direction .",
    "both @xcite and distributions are within a factor of 1.6 of the @xcite distribution .",
    "the surveys are in relatively good agreement despite the @xcite and surveys having no estimate of detection losses and the uncertainty in the estimated @xcite survey efficiency .",
    "the corrections for these two surveys would likely be not more than a factor of two , and any correction would further improve the match between the luminosity functions .",
    "while we do not include the @xcite survey ( of which the detections are a subset ) because of a lack of a published detection list , we nonetheless note that the shape of the cumulative number of objects agrees well with this survey .",
    "we can estimate the total number of large bodies ( _ _ r__@xmath2719.5 ) in the kuiper belt using the known objects reported to the minor planet center ( mpc ) .",
    "the bulk of the @xcite sky coverage is within 30 degrees of the ecliptic where the majority of the hot population objects are found ( see figure 1 ) , therefore we can estimate the number of bright kbos visible in the kuiper belt .",
    "the brightest body in the @xcite survey is quaoar with an _",
