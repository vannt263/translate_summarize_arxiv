    "as the quality of photometric data has improved over the years ( largely due to the use of ccds ) , the applicability of a fitting - function which can account for variations in the curvature of a light profile has been demonstrated for elliptical galaxies ( capaccioli 1987 , 1989 ; davies et al .",
    "1988 ; caon , capacciolli & donofrio 1993 ; young & currie 1994 ; graham et al .",
    "1996 ) , and for the bulges of spiral galaxies ( andredakis , peletier & balcells 1995 ; seigar & james 1998 ; moriondo , giovanardi & hunt 1998 ; khosroshahi , wadadekar & kembhavi 2000 ; prieto et al . 2001 ; graham 2001 ; mllenhoff & heidt 2001 ) .",
    "these systems are not universally described with either an exponential profile or an @xmath2 law ( de vaucouleurs 1948 , 1959 ) , but rather a continuous range of light profile shapes exist which are well described by the srsic ( 1968 ) @xmath0 model .    in ellipticals , the shape parameter @xmath1 from the srsic model is strongly correlated with the other global properties derived independently of the @xmath0 model , such as : total luminosity and effective radius ( caon et al.1993 ; young & currie 1994 , 1995 ; jerjen & bingelli 1997 ; trujillo , graham & caon 2001 ) , central velocity dispersion ( graham , trujillo & caon 2001 ) and also central supermassive black hole mass ( graham et al.2001 ) .",
    "additionaly , the spiral hubble type has been shown to correlate with the bulge index @xmath1 such that early  type spiral galaxy bulges have larger values of @xmath1 than late  type spiral galaxy bulges ( andredakis et al .",
    "1995 ; graham 2001 ) .",
    "this correlation arises from the fact that the index @xmath1 is well correlated with the bulge  to  disc luminosity ratio ( b / d ; see , e.g. simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) and this is one of the parameters used to establish morphological type ( sandage 1961 ) .",
    "given the abundance of observational work and papers now using the srsic model , it seems timely that a theoretical study is performed on realistic , analytical models following the @xmath0 law .",
    "structural and dynamical properties of isotropic , spherical galaxies following @xmath0 models have already been studied in detail in the insightful paper of ciotti ( 1991 )",
    ". however , most elliptical galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies are known to be non  spherical objects .",
    "typically , the mass models which have been used for the study of triaxial galaxies have followed analytical expressions which were selected to reproduce the properties of the de vaucouleurs @xmath2 profile ( e.g. jaffe 1983 ; hernquist 1990 ; dehnen 1993 ) , or more recently the modified hubble law ( chakraborty & thakur 2000 ) .",
    "for that reason , previous studies based on these kinds of analytical models , although certainly useful , are however unable to probe the full range of properties which are now observed in real galaxies .",
    "consequently , it is of importance to know how much room for improvement exits in the study of triaxial objects following the @xmath0 family of profiles .    due to",
    "the fact that the observed @xmath0 luminosity profiles can not be deprojected to yield analytical expression for the spatial density is an integer . ] , the @xmath0 law has been considered less useful for studies of detailed modelling .",
    "an analytical representation ( approximation ) for the mass density profiles which accurately reproduces the observed @xmath0 luminosity profiles would be of great interest for simulations of real galaxies .",
    "we have therefore derived just such an analytical expression for the mass density profiles of the srsic family of models .",
    "our approximation surpasses the accuracy of both the dehnen models for representing the specific @xmath2 profile and also their extension to the double power  law models of zhao ( 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of how the physical properties of triaxial stellar systems change as a function of the index @xmath1 .",
    "an accurate analytical expression for modelling the spatial density is presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we explore the axisymmetric and the non  axisymmetric components of the potential , forces and torques associated with a srsic light distribution .",
    "finally , by using literature available k  band observations of a sample of 80 spiral galaxies , the physical basis to the @xmath1@xmath3 ( or @xmath1@xmath4 ) relation is investigated in section 4 .",
    "the projected , elliptically symmetric srsic @xmath0 intensity distribution @xmath5 can be written in terms of the projected , elliptical radial coordinate @xmath6 ( see details in trujillo et al .",
    "2001 ) such that : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the central intensity , and @xmath9 is the effective radius of the projected major  axis . curves of constant @xmath6 on the plane of the sky are the isophotes .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is a function of the shape parameter @xmath1 , and is chosen so that the effective radius encloses half of the total luminosity . the exact value is derived from @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the gamma function and the incomplete gamma function respectively ( abramowitz & stegun 1964 , p. 260 ) .",
    "the index @xmath1 increases monotonically with the central luminosity concentration of the surface brightness distribution ( trujillo , graham , & caon 2001 ) .",
    "the total projected luminosity l associated with this model is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ellipticity of the isophotes .",
    "for a homologous triaxial ellipsoid , the spatial ( deprojected ) luminosity density profile @xmath18 can be obtained by an abel integral equation ( stark 1977 ) : @xmath19(\\xi^2-\\zeta^2)^{-1/2}d\\xi , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a constant that depends on the three - dimensional spatial orientation of the object ( varela , muoz - tuoz & simonneau 1996 ; simonneau , varela & muoz - tuoz 1998 ) and @xmath21 parametrizes the ellipsoids of constant volume brightness .",
    "@xmath20 equals 1 when the proper axis frame of the object has the same orientation as the observer axis frame ( i.e.  when the euler angles between the two frames equal zero ) .",
    "assume a triaxial object whose mass is stratified over ellipsoids with axis ratios a : b : c ( a@xmath22b@xmath23c ) and the x ( z ) is the long ( short ) axis ( see fig .   1 ) .",
    "the symmetry of the problem motivates us to work with ellipsoidal coordinates where : @xmath24 and where @xmath25=b / a and @xmath26=c / a .",
    "the mass models considered in this study are the triaxial generalizations of the spherical models discussed in detail by ciotti ( 1991 ) .",
    "the mathematical singularities present in eq . 3 were considered and solved by simonneau & prada ( 1999 , eq .",
    "substituting eq . 1 into eq .",
    "3 , letting @xmath27 , and multiplying by the mass  to  light ratio @xmath28m / l , we obtain a similar expression to the one found by these authors : @xmath29 with @xmath30 the dimensionless mass density profiles @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total mass , are shown for different values of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "it should be noted that the inner density profile decreases more slowly with increasing radius for systems having lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "the mass density profiles of the @xmath0 family ( eq .",
    "5 ) can be extremely well approximated by the analytical expression : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the @xmath37th  order modified bessel function of the third kind ( abramowitz & stegun 1964 , p. 374 ) . in the appendix",
    "a we show the values of the parameters ( @xmath37,p , h@xmath38,h@xmath39,h@xmath40 ) as function of the index @xmath1 .",
    "this approximation contains two exact cases : @xmath1=0.5 and @xmath1=1 , and provides relative error less than 0.1% for the rest of the cases ( fig 2b ) in the radial range 10@xmath41 .",
    "this approximation surpasses ( by a factor of 10@xmath4210@xmath43 ) the expression presented in lima neto , gerbal & mrquez ( 1999 ) .",
    "for three different triaxiality mass distributions : a ) spherical ( @xmath25=@xmath26=1 ) ; b ) moderately triaxial ( @xmath25=0.75 , @xmath26=0.5 ) ; c ) highly triaxial ( @xmath25=0.5 , @xmath26=0.25 ) , we have explored , in detail , the non  axisymmetric gravitational field over the z=0 plane ( i.e. the disc plane when studying spiral galaxies ) .",
    "we evaluate this quantity by calculating : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the m=2 and m=0 component of the gravitational potential , such that the nth  order term @xmath47 is evaluated from the gravitational potential on the z=0 plane @xmath48 by using the fourier decomposition ( see , e.g. combes & sanders 1981 ) .",
    "gravitational potential and gravitational force expressions are shown on appendix b.    the profiles of @xmath49 for different triaxialities and values of @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . as it is expected , as the triaxiality increases the non  spherical nature of the gravitational field increases . also",
    ", we highlight that for a given triaxiality , smaller values of @xmath1 ( i.e less concentrated mass distribution ) give greater non - spherical gravitational fields .",
    "the maximum non  axisymmetrical behavior of the potential is obtained at radial distances less than 2 @xmath9 .",
    "this radial distance is also a function of the index @xmath1 , decreasing a @xmath1 increases and remains quite independent of the triaxiality of the object . for a moderately triaxial object with @xmath1=1 ,",
    "the non  axisymmetrical component of the potential can vary some 6% between r=0 and r=2@xmath9 , and varies some 15% for our highly triaxial model .    for an @xmath1=1 model , and starting from our moderately triaxial case ( @xmath25=0.75 , @xmath26=0.50 ) , we increased the value of @xmath26 to 0.75 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3c and reveal that g(r ) varied only mildly .",
    "this figure shows that the non  axisymmetric effect ( along the radial distance ) in the z=0 plane is mainly due to how the mass of the bulge is distributed in this plane .",
    "the non  spherical component of the radial gravitational forces in the z=0 can be estimated by : @xmath50 in fig .",
    "3 the n(r ) profiles ( eq",
    ". 9 ) are evaluated for the same cases as was the g(r ) profiles .",
    "a remarkable point is that n(r ) reaches its maximum value in the radial range 2 @xmath9@xmath51r@xmath514 @xmath9 . for a spiral bulge structure",
    ", this means that the most important non  axisymmetric effects take place in a zone which is dominated by the disc . as with the g(r ) parameter , stronger distortions occur as the triaxiality increases and the index @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the mechanism which controls this distortion is basically determined by the mass distribution in the z=0 plane ( fig 3c ) .",
    "it is noted that the relative ( i.e. % change ) non  axisymmetric effects on the radial forces are larger than the relative distortion on the potential . as an example , for a moderately triaxial structure with @xmath1=1 the non  axisymmetric component of the radial forces can reach 8% .",
    "the torques provoked by the triaxial structures along the angular coordinate are evaluated around the circle of radius @xmath52 where the maximum non  axisymmetrical distortion of the radial forces is produced ( i.e. at the peak of the n(r ) profile ) .",
    "given the gravitational potential @xmath48 in the z=0 plane , we have at the radius @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54/r_{max}$ ] represents the amplitude of the tangential force along the angular coordinate at radius @xmath52 , and @xmath55 is the radial force at this radius . due to the symmetry of the ellipsoid , the values of @xmath56 need only be plotted for one quadrant in the z=0 plane ; we use 0@xmath57@xmath5890@xmath57 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "depending on the quadrant , @xmath56 is either negative or positive because the sign of the tangential force changes from quadrant to quadrant .",
    "the maximum torque around a circle of radius @xmath52 depends on the triaxiality of the object .",
    "as the triaxiality increases the maximum torque tends to be closer to the major axis  as one would expect .",
    "the position of this peak is quite independent of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the absolute value of the torque for any given triaxiality increases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "for our highly triaxial bulge , @xmath56 ranges from 0.17 ( @xmath1=10 ) to 0.24 ( @xmath1=1 ) , which would be considered a `` bar strength '' class of 2 in the classification scheme of buta & block ( 2001 ) . in the case of our moderately triaxial object",
    ", the maximum absolute value of @xmath56 ranges between 0.06 and 0.09 .",
    "these values correspond to a `` bar strength '' class of 1 .",
    "thus , even a moderately triaxial bulge is capable of provoking non ",
    "negligible torques on a disk  that is to say , a bar is not neccessarily required .",
    "a detailed study separating the torque contribution from both bars and bulges would of course be of interest , and it is our intention to add a range of bar potentials to our models in the future .    as with the previous parameters , for the range of triaxialities investigated and a given @xmath1 , varying the mass distribution along the z  axis ( i.e. varying the triaxiality parameter @xmath26 ) only results in a slight change to @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "3c ) . for a spherical distribution all above parameters",
    "in the previous section we have seen how the non  axisymmetrical effects ( in the z=0 plane ) from a triaxial bulge increase as @xmath1 decreases . taken with the correlation between @xmath1 and galaxy type ( andredakis , peletier & balcells 1995 ) shown in fig .",
    "4 , this invokes the natural question : how , if at all , are the structural properties of the bulges ( i.e. @xmath1 ) related ( that is , cause and effect ) with the non  axisymmetrical components ( i.e. arms ) observed in the disc ?",
    "the results obtained in the previous sections were evaluated without any mention to the relative mass of the bulge and disc .",
    "it turns out that the axisymmetrical mass distribution of the disc causes a strong softening of the non  axisymmetrical perturbation caused by the non  sphericity of the bulge .",
    "the degree of `` smoothing '' is an increasing function of the @xmath59 ratio .",
    "5 shows the n(r ) profile for a moderately triaxial bulge with @xmath60 and @xmath4=0.1 and 0.01 , and for a bulge with @xmath61 and @xmath4=1.0 and 0.1 ( fig .",
    "n(r ) was evaluated here assuming the disc follows an exponential surface brightness distribution .",
    "the ratio between the length scale of the disc and the effective radius of the bulge is assumed to be constant and with a value of @xmath62=5 . in the @xmath63-band",
    "is 5 ( graham & prieto 1999 ) . ] the expressions for the potential and the radial force of these structures can be found in binney & tremaine ( 1987 , p.  77 and 78 ) .",
    "5 illustrates that for @xmath4 luminosity ratios typical of real galaxies , the non  axisymmetrical effects on the disc largely disappear ( @xmath64 ) . for @xmath4=1 ,",
    "the values of the n(r ) profile remain basically unchanged to that seen in fig .  3 , but for @xmath4=0.1 these values decrease approximately by a factor 2 , and for @xmath4=0.01 this factor is bigger than 10 .",
    "thus , although the non  radial effects on the z=0 plane increase as @xmath1 decreases , the smoothing effects of the increasingly dominant disc are stronger .",
    "bulges with small values of @xmath1 are unable to produce significant non  axisymmetrical effects on a massive disc .      to explore the connection between bulges and discs in spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. fuchs 2000 ) , we have used the data from two independent samples of galaxies observed in the k  band .",
    "the k  band provides a good tracer of the mass due to the near absence of dust extinction and the reduced biasing effect of a few per cent ( in mass ) of young stars .",
    "we used the data from andredakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the structural analysis of the de jong ( 1996 ) data performed by graham ( 2001 ) .",
    "both studies were done fitting a seeing convolved srsic law to the spiral galaxy bulges . in both samples",
    "we have removed those objects which contained a clear bar structure , leaving a total of 28 objects from andredakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and 52 objects from graham ( 2001 ) .",
    "the relations present in fig .",
    "4 between @xmath1 and the @xmath4 luminosity ratio , and @xmath1 versus the morphological type t have a spearman rank ",
    "order correlation coefficient of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , for the combined sample .",
    "andredakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest `` although other possibilities can not be excluded , the most straightforward explanation for this trend is that the presence of the disc affects the density distribution of the bulge in such a way as to make the bulge profile steeper in the outer parts .",
    "one mechanism to produce such an effect might be that a stronger disc truncates the bulge , forcing its profile to become exponential '' .",
    "following this line of thought , via collisionless n",
    " body simulations , andredakis ( 1998 ) studied the adiabatic growth of the disc onto an existing @xmath2 spheroid .",
    "he found that the disc potential modifies the bulge surface brightness profile , lowering the index @xmath1 .",
    "this decrease was larger with more massive and more compact discs .",
    "this mechanism , however , saturated at around @xmath1=2 and exponential bulges could not be produced .",
    "we believe that this line of reasoning is not the most appropiate explanation for the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , we find that the index @xmath1 is not only well correlated with the luminous @xmath4 ratio , but is equally well correlated ( @xmath68 ) with bulge luminosity @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "additionally , the correlation between @xmath1 and disc luminosity @xmath70 is relatively poor ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "secondly , @xmath69 is more strongly correlated ( @xmath72 ) with the @xmath4 ratio than @xmath70 and the @xmath4 ratio ( @xmath73 ) ( fig .",
    "hence , it is variations in the bulge which are predominantly responsible for variations in the @xmath4 ratio .",
    "these above two correlations seem to indicate that @xmath1 may be related directly with the properties of the bulge rather than with the combined @xmath4 ratio .",
    "consequently , as @xmath1 is correlated with the total bulge luminosity , the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 is a result of the more fundamental correlation between @xmath69 and @xmath4 .",
    "that is , it is not the relative increase in disc  to  bulge luminosity which produces bulges with smaller values of @xmath1 , but simply that bulges with larger values of @xmath1 are more luminous ( or vice  versa ) and this produces the correlation between @xmath1 and the @xmath4 luminosity ratio .",
    "favouring this argument , we note that among the elliptical galaxies ( without the need to invoke any disc ) there exists a strong correlation ( pearson s r=-0.82 ; graham , trujillo & caon , 2001 ) between @xmath1 and the total luminosity of these objects . the index @xmath1 of pressure supported stellar systems are related with the total luminosity of these structures . in agreement with this , aguerri , balcells & peletier ( 2001 ) have found ( using collisionless n  body simulations ) that the bulges of late  type galaxies can increase their @xmath1 values via dense satellite accretions where the new value of @xmath1 is found to be proportional to the devoured satellite mass .      due to the strong correlation between the @xmath4 luminosity ratio and @xmath69 , it might be of interest to ask which one of these quantities is preferred to establish the morphological type t of a galaxy . working from b  band images ( which is good for observing the young star population , and consequently the spiral arm structure , which is one of the basic criteria to the hubble galaxy classification ) , simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) fitted @xmath2 profiles and exponential discs to a sample of 64 spiral galaxies and 34 s0 type galaxies .",
    "they presented a good correlation between the bulge  to  disc luminosity and @xmath3 , but not between @xmath74 and @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , their b  band observations suggested that the @xmath4 luminosity ratio was preferred to @xmath74 for establishing the morphological type t. in fig .",
    "7 we show the relation between the @xmath4 luminosity ratio and t ( @xmath75 ) and between @xmath69 and t ( @xmath76 ) . thus , from k  band observations , and fitting @xmath0 bulge profile models , the change in the luminous mass of the bulge along the hubble sequence appears equally as important as the combined change in the bulge and disc luminosity between the @xmath4 luminosity ratio and t , but only @xmath77 between @xmath74 and t. ] .",
    "it would then follow that the luminous mass of the bulge ( i.e. @xmath69 ) is related with the spiral arm structure .",
    "the main results of this work are the following :    \\a ) we have generalised the analysis of the physical properties of spherical stellar systems following the @xmath0 luminosity law to a homologous triaxial distribution . the density distribution , potential , forces and torques are evaluated and compared with the spherical case when applicable ( ciotti 1991 ) .",
    "an extremely accurate analytical approximation ( relative error less than 0.1% ) for the mass density profile is provided .",
    "\\b ) we derive an exact expression showing how the central potential decreases as triaxiality increases .",
    "we also show that for a fixed triaxiality , as the index @xmath1 decreases the non  axisymmetrical effects in the z=0 plane increase .",
    "even for a moderately triaxial object , the non  axisymmetrical component of the potential and the radial forces are not negligible for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "these components can range from 6 to 8% , respectively , compared to the value of the spherical component . for our highly triaxial model",
    ", they can range over some 20% .",
    "\\c ) the non  axisymmetrical effects in the disc plane due to the bulge structure are strongly reduced when an axisymmetrical disc mass is added .",
    "for this reason , bulges with smaller values of @xmath1 appear unlikely to produce any significant non  axisymmetrical effect on their disc , which is typically 10 to 100 more times more massive than the bulge . in this regard , the @xmath4 mass ratio and the triaxiality of the bulge are more important , that is , can dominate over the effects of small @xmath1 .",
    "\\d ) the correlation found between @xmath1 and the @xmath4 luminosity ratio found in spiral galaxies is explained here not as a consequence of the interplay between the bulge and the disc , but due to the strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath78 , and between @xmath78 and @xmath4 .",
    "also , k  band data do not support the idea that the @xmath4 luminosity ratio can be preferred over @xmath78 as an indicator to establish galaxy morphological type ( t ) .",
    "both parameters present equally good correlations with galaxy type t.    99 abramowitz m. , stegun i. , 1964 , handbook of mathematical functions .",
