    "the recent decade has witnessed the observational evidence for the cosmic acceleration of the universe , which has become the central theme of modern cosmology . this evidence is built up of observations of supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , and large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . in einstein s gravity , this acceleration can not be explained by normal matter or fields on friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric background ; therefore a mysterious cosmic fluid with negative pressure , the so called _ dark energy _ , is introduced . presently , understanding the nature of the dark energy is one of the main problems in the research area of both theoretical physics and cosmology .",
    "a simple example of dark energy is the cosmological constant , equivalent to a fluid with the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is the pressure of dark energy , and @xmath3 its energy density .",
    "however , the cosmological constant model is subject to the so - called _ fine - tuning _ and _ coincidence problems _ @xcite .    dark energy , if it is a perfect fluid , must have eos parameter @xmath4 . if @xmath5 , the dark energy is called the _ quintessence",
    "_ @xcite ; if @xmath6 , dark energy is dubbed a _ phantom fluid _ @xcite . in spite of the fact that these models violate both the strong energy condition @xmath7 and the dominant energy condition @xmath8 , and therefore may be physically considered undesirable ,",
    "the phantom energy is found to be compatible with current data from sne ia observations , cmb anisotropy and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "dark energy behavior can be exhibited by possible new fundamental fields acting on cosmological scales .",
    "the simplest such model is the single component scalar field .",
    "other alternatives in the literature include the cardassian expansion scenario @xcite , the tachyon @xcite , the quintom @xcite , the k - essence  @xcite models and more .",
    "alternatively , modifications of einstein s gravity have been proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration of the universe ; among them @xmath9 theories @xcite .",
    "for example , quintessential behavior of the parameter @xmath10 can be achieved in a geometrical way in higher order theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "scalar fields with various couplings and potentials can be put in by hand , or follow from the model naturally .",
    "one of the simplest modification of einstein s gravity is the brans - dicke ( bd ) gravity theory @xcite , a well known example of a scalar - tensor theory which represents the gravitational interaction using a scalar field in addition to the metric field .",
    "this theory is parametrized by one extra constant parameter , @xmath11 . in the limit @xmath12",
    ", the bd theory reduces to einstein s gravity @xcite .",
    "the conditions , where the dynamics of a self - interacting bd field can account for the accelerated expansion , have been considered in ref.@xcite , where it was concluded that accelerated expanding solutions can be obtained with a quadratic self - coupling of the bd field and a negative equation of state ( eos ) parameter .",
    "astrophysical data indicate that eos parameter @xmath10 lies in an interval of negative values roughly centered around @xmath13 .",
    "the majority of popular cosmological models , including all the ones referred to above , use the _ cosmological principle _ , that is , they assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "on the other hand , there are hints in the cmb temperature anisotropy studies that suggest that the assumption of statistical isotropy is broken on the largest angular scales , leading to some intriguing anomalies @xcite . to provide predictions for the cmb anisotropies ,",
    "one may consider the homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies known as bianchi type spacetimes , which include the isotropic and homogeneous frw models @xcite . in this study",
    "we consider the simplest of these , the locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi type i spacetime as an anisotropic background universe model ; note that this spacetime is a generalization of flat ( @xmath14 ) frw metric .",
    "our aim is to investigate the solutions of the field equations of scalar - tensor , in particular , bd theory of gravity for the lrs bianchi type i spacetime using the noether symmetry approach .",
    "the noether symmetry approach was introduced by de ritis _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and capozziello _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to find preferred solutions of the field equations and the dynamical conserved quantity .",
    "the noether theorem states that if the lie derivative of a given lagrangian @xmath15 dragging along a vector field @xmath16 vanishes @xmath17 then @xmath16 is a symmetry for the dynamics , and it generates a conserved current .",
    "recently some exact solutions have been presented in the scalar tensor theories following the noether symmetry approach that allows the potential to be chosen dynamically , restricting the arbitrariness in a suitable way @xcite .",

    "we also make a conformal transform to the so - called _ einstein frame _ in section [ einstein ] and discuss the problem in that context .",

    "for all solutions ( with nonzero @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) , at late time , latexmath:[$h \\rightarrow    asymptotic behavior of the universe(s ) . for positive @xmath149 , the scalar field @xmath23",
    "approaches a constant .",
    "if either one of @xmath159 and @xmath160 is zero , the universe either expands or contracts exponentially , depending on the sign of @xmath149 and on which constant vanishes . in these cases , @xmath194 at all times , and for @xmath141 ( isotropic ) , @xmath23 is constant .",
    "a constant scalar field is the standard ( simplest ) way in the literature for causing exponential expansion , and in the isotropic case can be interpreted as creating a cosmological constant . for positive @xmath149 ,",
    "the solution approaches isotropy at late times .",
    "according to recent astrophysical data , the deceleration parameter of the universe lies in the interval @xmath195 @xcite . in all models of this subsection at late time @xmath87",
    "converges to @xmath13 , so in this sense these models are consistent with the observational results",
    ".      we may also use @xmath147 , where @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath150 are non - zero constants , since this function is similar to the frw big rip models . then eqs.([metric - a1])-([sclr - fld ] ) become @xmath198 , \\label{rip - a } \\\\ & & b(t)= \\frac{-l_0}{m \\sqrt{a_{3 } } } ( t_{c}-t)^{1+m/2 }   \\left[l_1 a_3 ^ 3 ( t_{c}-t)^{-3m}+l_2\\right]^{1/2 } ,   \\label{rip - b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath199}. \\label{rip - sclrfld}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the substitutions @xmath200 and @xmath201 bring these expressions into the same form as eqs.([powerlaw - a - b ] ) and ( [ sclr - fld3 ] ) . therefore all solutions from section [ powerlaw ] apply , we just have to read the lines of the tables in that section from right to left , and switch the sign of @xmath148 ( and of course , shift any `` i '' designation to the other side of the singularity ) .",
    "so this seed does not only give big rip models ( see ref.@xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "of course , @xmath135 being a free function , an infinite number of choices is possible , not to mention the freedom in the choices of @xmath159 and @xmath160 . among these , we are naturally interested in those choices that give simple metric functions @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "one way of achieving this would be to set @xmath159 or @xmath160 equal to zero .",
    "but @xmath141 takes us to isotropic solutions , which are not in line with the emphasis of the present work .",
    "the choice @xmath173 , although it will give simple - looking solutions , limits us to the case of massless field , and there seems to be no motivation for choosing a particular solution above others , except possibly @xmath202 ( since the comoving volume stays constant ) , but this is already covered in subsection [ powerl1zero ] .",
    "one can also choose combinations to make both @xmath135 and @xmath203 simple .",

    "another solution , @xmath212 is mathematically similar , but describes universes with infinite lifetime , for example the @xmath183 universe starts with a cigar - like big bang and approaches de sitter - like isotropically expanding universe at late time .",
    "it is known that a scalar - tensor theory can be transformed to the so - called _ einstein frame _ , where the gravitational scalar field becomes minimally coupled to curvature .",
    "the price to pay for this simplification is the equivalence principle : massive point particles do not follow geodesics any more , in contrast to the _ jordan frame _ , which we used so far in this work  @xcite . for the bd theory ,",
    "the case @xmath73 is special : we derived it from the vanishing of the hessian ( [ hessian ] ) , it represents a fixed - point of the conformal transformation  @xcite , and marks the boundary beyond which ghosts appear  @xcite . in the einstein frame , this specialness is reflected in the gravitational scalar field becoming non - dynamical .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to look at our solutions also in the einstein frame .",

    ", the ( transformed ) scalar field @xmath140 does not appear in the action , hence the scalar field is non - dynamical as stated in the beginning of this section ; and the field equations take the form @xmath221 where the ricci tensor @xmath222 refers to the transformed metric @xmath223 .",
    "the lrs bianchi i spacetime can be brought back to its original form @xmath224 by a simple coordinate transformation after the conformal transformation .",
    "the transformations of time coordinate and scale factors from the jordan frame to the einstein frame are given by @xmath225 for this spacetime in einstein frame the field equations ( [ f - eq - ein ] ) give @xmath226 where the prime represents derivative with respect to tilted time coordinate @xmath227 .",
    "these equations can be solved exactly , giving @xmath228 for @xmath229 ; @xmath230 for @xmath231 ; @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",
    "we note here that the obtained scale factors given in ( [ tr - metric - coeff - t-0 ] ) represent the well known kasner solution .",
    "we would like to check the consistency between these solutions and those in the jordan frame , ( [ metric - a1])-([sclr - fld ] ) . for given @xmath70 ,",
    "the jordan frame solutions contain the arbitrary function @xmath135 and two arbitrary constants @xmath234 and @xmath160 ( @xmath159 is not independent ) .",

    "to show consistency , we need to transform the jordan frame solutions to the einstein frame and show that they agree with solution found in that frame .    applying the transformations in ( [ tr - metric - coeff ] ) to ( [ metric - a1 ] ) and ( [ metric - b1 ] ) , using ( [ sclr - fld ] ) , we get @xmath239 using ( [ b_trans ] ) in ( [ sclr - fld ] ) , we can write for @xmath23 in the transformed coordinates @xmath240 but using ( [ tr - metric - coeff ] ) , @xmath241 so @xmath23 disappears from the equation : it can not be determined in the transformed coordinates .",
    "this was to be expected , since the scalar field is absent from the action ( [ action - ein ] ) .",
    "the arbitrariness ( or information ) in @xmath135 in the jordan frame has shifted to @xmath235 in the einstein frame .",
    "returning to ( [ phi_trans ] ) and using the solution found for @xmath242 , e.g. for positive @xmath70 , @xmath243 where it should be noted that @xmath244 ( see after eq.([sol1 ] ) ) .",
    "this will hold , if @xmath237 is chosen such that @xmath160 is equal to @xmath245 .",
    "this choice can be made , since obviously the set @xmath246 can not be independent of the set @xmath247 : if two solutions describe the same physical reality , the parameters ( arbitrary constants ) of one should be expressible in terms of the parameters of the other , although information could hide in the arbitrary function(s ) in this case .",
    "similarly , ( [ a_trans ] ) will agree with ( [ tr - metric - coeff - t-1 ] ) , if @xmath238 is properly chosen ; but @xmath236 is not related to @xmath234 or @xmath160 , it comes from the integration in the first term in ( [ tr - metric - coeff ] ) .",
    "the same calculations can be made for the cases of negative and vanishing @xmath70 , establishing consistency of einstein frame solutions with the jordan frame solutions .",
    "for example , we can transform the solutions of subsection 6.1.1 ( @xmath248 , isotropic ) as @xmath249 and those of subsection 6.1.2 ( @xmath173 ) as @xmath250^{1/2 } t^{(3/2)n-1 } \\longrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\ & & t = t_{0 } ( \\tilde{t}+\\tilde{c_{1}})^{2/(3n ) } , \\;\\ ; \\tilde{a } = a_{0 } ( \\tilde{t}+\\tilde{c_{1}})^{-1/3 } , \\;\\ ; \\tilde{b } = b_{0 }   ( \\tilde{t}+\\tilde{c_{1}})^{2/3 } , \\label{tr - metric - coeff-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath251^{1/(3n ) } , \\;\\ ; a_0=\\left[\\frac{2 l_{2}}{3l_{0}}\\right]^{1/3 } \\;\\;{\\rm and } \\;\\ ; b_0=\\left[\\frac{9",

    "although containing only three parameters , are the transformed versions of the solutions in the jordan frame , which contained an arbitrary function .",
    "this correspondence between a solution for the metric in the einstein frame and an infinite number of metrics in the jordan frame is possible , since the scalar field , which determines the transformation between the two frames , is arbitrary in the einstein frame .",
    "in this paper we have examined the scalar - tensor brans - dicke theory of gravity for lrs bianchi type i spacetime admitting noether symmetry .",
    "this symmetry approach is important because it provides us with a theoretical motivation to select a region of the solution space ( for other motivations , leading to different regions of the solution space for the bianchi type i spacetimes , see e.g. refs.@xcite-@xcite ) . the lagrangian density ( [ lagra ] ) of lrs bianchi type i becomes degenerate for @xmath253 , when the brans - dicke coupling function @xmath254 is used .",
    "this degeneracy is required for nontrivial solutions , hence we use this value as the bd parameter .",
    "the existence of noether symmetry also restricts the form of potential @xmath22 , and allows us to find a transformation given by ( [ i - trns ] ) in which the metric potentials and the scalar field are stated in terms of new dynamical variables ( @xmath255 ) , where the variable @xmath101 is cyclic . under the transformation ( [ i - trns ] )",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagra ] ) reduces to a new , simpler one ( [ lag2 ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the new set of field equations ( [ el])-([e - l2 ] ) for the lrs bianchi type i spacetime by using these transformations . we have found the general class of solutions of bd field equations with potential @xmath256 in the background of lrs bianchi type i spacetime exhibiting noether symmetry .",
    "this solution family contains an arbitrary function , called @xmath135 in this work , and two arbitrary constants .    in section [ ornekler ]",
    ", we gave examples using some simple forms of the _ seed function _",
    "@xmath135 ; first as powers , then exponentials , powers of @xmath257 , and some others .",
    "the first three are chosen to be similar to popular models in frw cosmology .",
    "the solutions are shown concisely in tables , clearly showing the relation between the behavior of the model universes and the parameters of the seed function .    because of the specialness of the value @xmath258 for the bd - theory when one considers conformal transformations , we considered the problem also in the _ einstein frame _ in section [ einstein ] . for this value ,",
    "the scalar field becomes non - dynamical , taking on the arbitrary nature of the function @xmath135 in the _ jordan frame_. the solutions found in the einstein frame are consistent with those found in the jordan frame ; they can be transformed into each other .",
    "the models found in section [ ornekler ] show a wide range of behaviors , featuring big bangs , big crunches , big rips , bounces , various singularities of the cigar or pancake types , etc .",
    "while some of these solutions are of theoretical interest only , there are many expanding - universe solutions with acceleration , consistent with observational data . for example , all the solutions in table [ tb : l1l2nonzero ] and all solutions in subsection [ ustel ] except the few strictly contracting solutions , feature late - time acceleration .",
    "even the isotropic special case with power - seed function displays surprising richness , despite the time - dependence of the scalar field being the same for all powers .",
    "one solution is particularly interesting : it is minkowski space , containing a nontrivial scalar field .",
    "the particular nonminimal coupling and the potential selected by the hessian determinant condition and the noether symmetry make this possible",
    ". given the important guiding role of the concept of symmetry in modern theoretical physics , we believe that the family of solutions found and analyzed in this work constitute a potentially more relevant set among all possible solutions for lrs bianchi type - i cosmological models containing a brans - dicke field .",
