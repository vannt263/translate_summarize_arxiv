    "the confinement of quarks is a remarkable phenomenon that features both static and dynamical aspects . to reveal its underlying mechanism",
    "it is on the one hand essential to restrict the analysis by considering certain limits where the system is considerably simpler and particular aspects of the mechanism become transparent . on the other hand one",
    "extends the analysis to similar systems , in order to identify the requirements and characteristic properties of the mechanism .",
    "an important limit in this respect is the static case and the corresponding confinement of fundamental color sources which presents an analytic result of non - abelian gauge theory in the strong - coupling limit @xcite and which has been confirmed in numerical simulations at realistic coupling .",
    "this is reflected by an area law behavior of large wilson loops corresponding to a linear potential between the sources and presents a genuine property of the gauge dynamics that is independent of the detailed aspects of the sources and merely depends on the representation of the gauge group .",
    "+ within the last years a detailed picture of the infrared ( ir ) sector of yang - mills theory and qcd has evolved , mainly due to investigations within either functional approaches as dyson - schwinger equations @xcite and functional renormalisation group equations @xcite , respectively , or lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the infrared singularities of landau gauge quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can provide a mechanism for the confinement of static quarks @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , relying on the ir scaling solution of yang - mills theory @xcite , is driven by a strong kinematic singularity of the quark - gluon vertex that overturns the ir suppression of the gluon propagator and leads to a long - range gluonic interaction . yet , in this approach this is inherently obtained from the static limit of the solution of the functional equations of the quark sector of the theory . since the mechanism exhibits a relation between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , this poses the question whether the dirac structure of the quarks is essential for this mechanism . in order to answer this question we present here",
    "results for a related theory where the quarks are replaced by a fundamentally charged scalar field , for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "this theory is interesting because of its simplicity owing to the absence of internal spin degrees of freedom compared to the fermionic theory and has been studied before as a model system for the qcd dynamics . on the other hand , this theory involves additional self - interactions between the scalars and thereby could exhibit a rather different dynamical behavior .",
    "most notably it involves a higgs phase in addition to a confining phase , and it has been shown that in the fundamentally charged scalar model the confined and the higgs phase are not separated by a phase boundary @xcite .",
    "+ in dynamical qcd a gluonic interaction that rises with distance is only realized over a certain range that varies continuously with the quark mass(es ) @xcite .",
    "a simplified model system to study all these aspects would be highly desirable .",
    "interestingly string breaking signatures have likewise been observed in lattice simulations of the scalar model , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , before corresponding studies were possible in dynamical qcd , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "in order to construct a model system for full qcd , where ( fermionic ) quarks carry a conserved charge and transform according to the fundamental representation of the gauge group , we attribute the same transformation properties also to the ( bosonic ) scalars .",
    "therefore the scalars will firstly be implemented in the fundamental representation , and secondly the scalar field must be a complex field in order to be able to define a conserved charge .",
    "these scalars will be coupled to an @xmath0 gauge theory , and as we aim at comparing the system to landau gauge qcd we also fix to landau gauge , i.e. we take the limit for the gauge fixing parameter @xmath1 . considering only renormalizable interactions this generally results in the lagrangian given by @xmath2 with @xmath3",
    "wherein @xmath4 denotes the covariant derivative , involving the gell - mann matrices @xmath5 , for the complex scalar field @xmath6 with the associated mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the coupling constant for a quartic scalar interaction , @xmath9 is the field - strength tensor involving the gluons @xmath10 and the structure constants @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the covariant derivative for the faddeev - popov ( anti-)ghosts @xmath13 in the adjoint representation .",
    "lorentz - indices are written in greek letters , roman indices starting with @xmath14 are color - indices and the fundamental representation is indexed by roman letters starting with @xmath15.in contrast to qcd the tensor structure of the scalar model is strongly simplified . in the quark propagator one has to consider a dirac - vector as well as a dirac - scalar component .",
    "instead for scalar bosons , there is only one ( scalar ) tensor component in the scalar propagator @xmath16 .",
    "similarly the scalar - gluon vertex @xmath17 depending on two independent momenta can be decomposed into two tensors , in contrast to 12 independent tensors in the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "this simplification becomes even more significant for higher correlation functions .",
    "we will choose the parametrization @xmath18 where the two independent momenta are conveniently chosen as the incoming scalar and the gluon momentum .",
    "note that besides the simplification in the tensor structures two additional subtleties arise that are not present in qcd .",
    "firstly , the classical lagrangian contains additional 4-particle - interactions involving scalars , whose analogous terms are not present in qcd due to dimensional reasons ( renormalizability ) .",
    "secondly , a scalar field theory gives rise to a possible scalar condensate via the higgs mechanism .",
    "+ here a note is in order .",
    "the theory described above develops a more complicated phase structure compared to qcd .",
    "as the gauge is already fixed the residual symmetry that is broken must be a global one @xcite .",
    "note that it is ascertained that these two different `` phases '' of the system are not separated by a phase boundary @xcite , but rather by a kertsz line , i.e. they are continuously connected . in that sense",
    "the terminology of `` phases '' is not strictly correct , but as it is frequently used in the literature we will adapt this nomenclature .",
    "a suitable quantity to investigate the phase transition is an order parameter @xcite of the form @xmath19 the relation of screening to confinement has been subject to other investigations @xcite . in this work",
    "we will not discuss the effects due to scalar condensation and concentrate on the confinement properties of the model - leaving a detailed analysis of a condensate for future work .",
    "+ in the following we will use the functional dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) to describe the non - perturbative dynamics of the theory .",
    "the dse analysis we perform here relies on the framework described in detail in @xcite and is similar to the analysis in qcd @xcite .",
    "the details on the derivation of the presented results can be found in @xcite .",
    "the dses for the theory can be derived algorithmically @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equations in the gauge sector are given in @xcite , which also hold for coupled scalars in the quenched approximation .",
    "in the case of a dynamical scalar these equations are extended by unquenching graphs with closed scalar loops analogous to the case of qcd .",
    "the leading equations in the scalar sector are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar - dses ] where 2-loop diagrams arising in these equations are omitted .",
    "these equations represent an infinite tower of coupled integral equations and in general would require some truncation . in order to study interesting qualitative aspects , like the confinement of static sources , it is sufficient to study the long - range behavior of the theory . in momentum space",
    "this is encoded in the ir regime of correlation functions , and as far as only the ir scaling laws are concerned a solution of the whole tower is actually possible .",
    "this has previously been achieved via the help of a skeleton expansion @xcite and we will also employ this approach in this work .",
    "the skeleton expansion presents a loop expansion in terms of dressed green functions and this way the equations for the primitively divergent green functions are transformed into a closed system of equations .",
    "however , as argued recently the skeleton expansion is only a convenient tool and not mandatory since the ir scaling is strongly restricted and fully determined by the equations for the primitively divergent correlation functions , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . since in the scaling solution of yang - mills theory @xcite the ghost dynamics is strongly dominant in the ir regime and there is no direct coupling between scalars and ghosts in the lagrangian , the first ghost corrections in the scalar sector arise from two loop diagrams in the skeleton expansion .",
    "correspondingly , we have to consider these graphs in our analysis whereas otherwise higher loop graphs in the skeleton expansion must not be more divergent than the corresponding lower order graphs .",
    "the resulting leading ghost contribution in the scalar - gluon vertex dse is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : gh - box ] .",
    "similar diagrams emerge from the ghost contributions to the scalar-2-gluon vertex equation . + besides masses , qcd has no inherent scales far below the mev scale .",
    "thus in the ir regime @xmath20 all green functions should exhibit a scaling form in terms of the external momenta . in the case that all external momenta vanish uniformly ( _ uniform _ limit ) with a single external scale @xmath21 power law scaling solutions of the form @xmath22 are a natural ansatz for green functions .",
    "herein the canonical exponent @xmath23 reflects the dimension of the corresponding operator and the anomalous exponent @xmath24 describes the anomalous scaling induced by the dynamics . in the case of the scalar propagator and scalar - gluon vertex defined above the corresponding canonical dimensions are @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the uniform limit",
    "there is effectively only a single scale , and the loop integrals that are dominated by the poles of the integrand have to scale with this external scale .",
    "the scaling of a given loop graph can then be determined by a power counting analysis . yet , when there are additional mass scales present the loop integrals can also be dominated by scales of the order of the mass which has to be considered in detail in the power counting analysis @xcite . for a massive particle",
    "the propagator can alternatively be parametrized by a mass dressing function @xmath27 which features a massive ir behavior for @xmath28 and contains in this case an additional hard scale @xmath29 therefore the mass dressing function @xmath27 yields an additional exponent @xmath30 in the power counting , with @xmath31 for massive particles , and @xmath32 for massless particles , respectively .",

    "in this section we discuss the fundamentally charged scalar model in the limit where all external momenta of green functions vanish uniformly . in order to find such infrared solutions",
    "we perform a power counting analysis .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to find the scaling behavior of green functions under the assumption that all green functions scale with some power of @xmath33 in the deep infrared . in this case",
    "we can simply count the exponents of the different dynamical contributions in the dses and determine a solvable system for the scaling exponent of each green function . as @xmath34 the dominant term which determines the scaling of the corresponding green function is the one with the most divergent power law and correspondingly the one with the minimal ir exponent . with this procedure and the help of the skeleton expansion",
    "we obtain a closed system for the ir exponents of the primitively divergent vertex functions . for an illustrative example of this counting procedure consider the scalar propagator given in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar - dses ] in the top left corner . on the left hand side the power law ansatz gives @xmath35 since it is the inverse of the propagator that arises in the dse , giving an additional overall - sign .",
    "the right hand side involves four different diagrams , and the dominant term is correspondingly given by a minimum function of the individual exponents .",
    "the first diagram is simply the inverse bare propagator giving @xmath36 . in the second diagram one has to count the momentum dependence of the loop integration @xmath37 , a scalar - propagator @xmath38 , a gluon - propagator @xmath39 and a scalar - gluon vertex @xmath40 . performing the analogous power counting for the last two graphs and subtracting the canonical dimensions one obtains an equation for the anomalous dimension of the scalar - propagator @xmath41 applying the same procedure for all skeleton expanded dses of the primitively divergent vertex functions of pure gauge theory in @xcite and the scalar sector in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar - dses ] one obtains a closed system of equations for the ir exponents of the primitively divergent vertex functions . due to the scalar self - interaction",
    "this system of equations for the anomalous ir exponents proves to be rather extensive in the scalar model and is explicitly given in @xcite .",
    "+ the next task is then to find the leading infrared behavior of all green functions for the different infrared fixed points as solution of this purely algebraic system .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite it turns out that it is a convenient starting point to consider the equations from the gauge sector first , wherein the ghost equation is the most convenient one to start with .",
    "depending on the boundary condition of the dse that determines if the bare term is present or absent in the corresponding renormalized equation , this equation can , in addition to the trivial perturbative case , have two qualitatively different non - trivial solutions .",
    "these solutions are standardly referred to as _ scaling _ @xcite and _ decoupling _ solution @xcite , see @xcite and references therein for lattice results .",
    "note that both solutions yield a confining polyakov - loop potential @xcite .",
    "+ for each of these two classes of solutions one can subsequently solve the remaining system of coupled equations , starting with the gauge sector and continuing with the matter part . in the scalar sector",
    "different solutions are found in the massive and the massless case .",
    "the complete fixed point structure is given in table [ tab : fixed - points ] and presents the main result of our analysis .",
    "the mass of the scalar is here taken into account via the parameter @xmath30 , thus these fixed points in principle hold for both , a massless and a massive scalar field , but in the following we will see that there are further subtleties for massive particles .",
    ".the anomalous power law exponents of the primitively divergent green functions for the different fixed points of the fundamentally charged scalar theory in the uniform limit .",
    "the results are given for both massive scalars @xmath31 and massless scalars @xmath32 .",
    "the given anomalous exponents represent the scaling of the propagators of the ghosts @xmath42 , the gluons @xmath43 and the scalars @xmath44 as well as of the ghost - gluon vertex @xmath45 , the 3- and 4-gluon vertices @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the scalar - gluon vertex @xmath48 , the scalar-2-gluon vertex @xmath49 and the 4-scalar vertex @xmath50 .",
    "these power laws are only valid up to possible logarithmic corrections .",
    "the full vertices include also the canonical scaling dimension @xmath51 for the propagators and @xmath52 for the 3-point vertices .",
    "note that the uniform limit is not sufficient to determine the dominating scaling exponents of the scalar-2-gluon and the 4-scalar vertex .",
    "the values given here in parentheses will be corrected below by the inclusion of kinematic divergences for massive scalars .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is fixed by an explicit ir solution and the best known value is @xmath54 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however as in the case of qcd , for higher uniform correlation functions the consideration of kinematic divergences is required in a dse study even to get the proper scaling in the uniform limit . as explained in @xcite",
    "this is a peculiarity of the dses owing to the fact that they involve a bare vertex in each graph .",
    "thereby in a theory with enhanced vertices ir strength can be missing in the lowest order corrections and is represented dynamically in the contributions from correlation functions with one more external leg . to see this consider the last term in the equations of the 4-scalar vertex that involves a 5-point function .",
    "the latter satisfies its own dse which contains a graph with a simple gluon exchange correction involving only scalar - gluon vertices . inserting this correction into the corresponding term in the 4-scalar dse as visualized in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig:4-point ] yields a 2-loop diagram that looks very similar to the ordinary gluon exchange graph in the 4-scalar dse with the difference that the bare vertex has now a vertex correction .",
    "when the scalars are massive , this vertex correction loop receives contributions from hard loop momenta and scales only due to the kinematic divergence of the dressed vertex , cf .",
    "[ fig:4-point ] ( a ) . in the heavy quark limit",
    "the hard loop simply shrinks to a point and precisely presents a forth dressed vertex which is present from the outset in functional rg equations .",
    "this mechanism finally yields the leading ir scaling laws for the 4-point vertices in table [ tab : fixed - points ] . + now let us discuss the interaction between static scalar sources which is described by the heavy mass limit of the full 4-scalar vertex",
    ". here the relevant limit it is not the uniform kinematic configuration where momenta of the external scalars are in the ir regime and the scalars would correspondingly be on the light cone in minkowski space , but the exactly opposite limit where their mass is large and the external momenta are of the order of this large scale . nevertheless , when the scalars are far spatially separated the exchanged gluon momentum becomes soft and the correlator can be ir enhanced . due to",
    "the same mechanism described above the leading contribution arises from the graph on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig:4-point ] and the dominant kinematic contribution is given by graph ( b ) on the right hand side - again effectively adding a forth dressed vertex .",
    "the corresponding graph with a soft gluon exchange scales therefore in the ir as @xmath55 which leads after fourier transformation in the static limit to a linear potential in coordinate space @xmath56 correspondingly , scalars are subject to the same static confinement mechanism as quarks in the case of qcd .",
    "in contrast the decoupling solution does not provide a corresponding mechanism , i.e. if the decoupling solution were confining this would not be reflected in any @xmath57-point function with finite @xmath57 .",
    "+ it is easy to convince oneself that the universality of the long - range interaction between static fundamental color sources in the discussed mechanism is not restricted to the explicitly studied cases of dirac fermions and scalars but should actually hold for matter fields in any representation of the lorentz group .",
    "this follows since the performed ir analysis is totally independent of the lorentz structure and depends only on the topology of the individual graphs in the dses and the involved propagators and vertices .",
    "the case of a complex scalar field considered here presents the renormalizable theory of matter fields coupled to a yang - mills sector with the most general interactions in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the explicitly considered cases of scalars and dirac fermions present precisely the two distinct possibilities for the dynamics as far as the topology of possible graphs is concerned .",
    "deviations from the scaling laws obtained within a power counting analysis are only possible if there are identical cancellations of the leading graphs in the dses . in the case of the scalar-",
    "respectively quark - gluon vertex there is actually only a single leading diagram in the corresponding dse , cf .",
    "[ fig : scalar - dses ] and [ fig : gh - box ] , so that cancellations between different graphs are impossible here .",
    "this shows that the universality of the long - range interaction between static fundamentally charged sources , which is a natural property in the lattice framework , is indeed realized in the functional framework as well .",
    "+ finally , we note that although in this work we studied only gauge dependent green functions , the above 4-point correlator represents the lowest term in a power series representation of the exponential arising in the corresponding gauge invariant correlator where the two quark sources are connected by a wilson line .",
    "therefore , in case this leading term is not cancelled identically by higher order terms in the series , this gauge independent quantity likewise shows the observed long - range interaction .     and vanish in the ir limit or that they are hard @xmath58 of the order of the scalar mass .",
    "[ fig:4-point ] ]",
    "we have studied the ir fixed point structure of a non - abelian gauge theory coupled to a scalar matter field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group as a schematic model for the qcd dynamics .",
    "we find that the ir fixed point structure is indeed identical to the case of qcd and that for one type of solutions a kinematic divergence of the scalar - gluon vertex induces a linear confining interaction between static sources .",
    "the qualitatively identical confinement aspects of the scalar model compared to qcd show that this confinement mechanism is indeed universal and does not depend on the particular features of the matter fields .",
    "instead the long - range interaction between fundamental sources is a property of the gauge sector in complete analogy to results of lattice gauge simulations .",
    "therefore , it is merely a technical complication , that within functional green function methods the coupling of a fundamental color source to the gauge sector has to be obtained from the static limit of the dynamical equations of the corresponding matter fields . in this limit",
    "the kinematic divergence of the matter - gauge vertex simply describes the non - trivial dressing of the static color source .",
    "+ finally , we want to emphasize that due to the presented results the scalar theory presents an ideal model system to study a potential confinement mechanism in detail . within functional approaches",
    "the minimal system of coupled integral equations for the matter sector decreases from 14 for fermionic fields to 3 in the scalar case .",
    "this should strongly simplify the numerical treatment and allow to study quantitative aspects of the mechanism .",
    "even more importantly , the dramatic simplifications of scalars compared to fermions in lattice gauge simulations could allow to test this mechanism in lattice simulations .",

    "<S> recently it has been shown that infrared singularities of landau gauge qcd can confine static quarks via a linearly rising potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the same mechanism can also provide a confining interaction between charged scalar fields in the fundamental representation . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that within this scenario static confinement is a universal property of the gauge sector even though it is formally represented in the functional equations of the matter sector . </S>",
    "<S> the simplifications compared to the fermionic case make the scalar system an ideal laboratory for a detailed analysis of the confinement mechanism in numerical studies of the functional equations as well as in gauge - fixed lattice simulations . </S>"
