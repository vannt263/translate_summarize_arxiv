    "consequently , bell inequalities provide an extremely clear distinction between classical , local hidden variable ( lhv ) , and non - classical ( e.g. , quantum ) theories and so have been studied with great fervor since their discovery .",
    "another motivation for the study of bell inequalities has been from an informational point - of - view .",
    "quantum information has brought new insight into the very nature of quantum mechanics and bell inequalities have been used to gain insight into the information processing power of quantum mechanics .",
    "bell inequality violations have been used to guarantee the security of quantum key distribution @xcite , generate randomness @xcite , give an advantage in communication complexity @xcite and non - local games @xcite .",
    "recently , connections have been made between quantum computing and a violation of a bell inequality as giving some computational advantage @xcite .    despite their utility , there are many open questions about bell inequalities .",
    "many breakthroughs have been made by constructing bell inequalities for many parties each with a choice of two measurements and two measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "however , constructing bell inequalities ( that fully define lhv correlations ) in general is np - hard in the number of measurement choices and measurement outcomes at each site @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the bell inequality experiment away from the two measurement setting , two measurement outcome scenario have been studied and have led to the discovery of interesting phenomena @xcite . for example , quantum violations can be greater @xcite and more robust to experimental imperfections @xcite in these general scenarios .",

    "however , quantum theory does not obtain the maximal violation of the ch inequality possible in theories that do not allow superluminal signaling ( non - signaling for short ) , as demonstrated by popescu - rohrlich boxes @xcite . as a result",
    ", much work has gone into characterizing the space of non - signaling probability distributions @xcite .",
    "an approach based around convex polytopes has been particularly fruitful but the space of all non - signaling probability distributions remains complicated and often counter - intuitive , as demonstrated by the guess your neighbor s input non - local game @xcite .",
    "the convex polytope of non - signaling probability distributions in the ch inequality setting is well - studied and is an excellent platform for describing quantum correlations via an information theoretic , or physical principle @xcite . for more general settings ,",
    "it is difficult to describe the space of non - signaling probabilities . to avoid this difficulty",
    "yet still obtain some intuition about the space of non - signaling probabilities , we consider the space of correlators , i.e. , the space of probability distributions over joint outcomes .    for two - setting , two - outcome bell inequalities , the correlations studied in bell experiments can be described in terms of stochastic boolean maps , e.g. probabilistic mixtures of boolean functions from the two bits describing the measurement settings to the parity of the measurement outcomes , which is a single bit .",
    "this approach has proven well - suited to the study of many - body generalizations of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality and led to a number of unifications and new insights @xcite .    in this paper",

    "our generalization reveals new phenomena which do not occur in the simpler two - setting , two - outcome case .",
    "hand - in - hand with this `` computational '' description of correlations we shall use a geometric approach .",
    "the list of conditional probabilities describing the stochastic map can also be treated as a vector in a real vector space @xcite . in this picture , the valid sets of correlations which occur in a theory form a convex region in this space , which , in the case of lhv theories , is a polytope .",
    "a polytope can be defined as the intersection of the half - spaces that satisfy a set of linear inequalities , which , for the lhv polytope , are simply the facet bell inequalities .",
    "very recently , two of us showed that for 2-setting 2-outcome bell inequalities , computational expressiveness provides an elegant method for studying measurement - based quantum computing @xcite .",
    "we shall show how such approaches can be generalized , and that the switch from boolean to more general maps allows more complex behavior than in the binary case .    in section [ sec2 ]",

    "the general scenario we consider is the @xmath5-partite bell experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where @xmath8 . for simplicity , we assume all space - like separated parties choose from @xmath0 possible measurement settings , each with @xmath1 possible outcomes , so we label an experiment by the variables @xmath9 .    as in the standard chsh experiment",
    ", we assume that each party s measurement setting is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution and is uncorrelated with the state of the system ( see @xcite for some consequences of dropping this assumption ) .",
    "we label the @xmath0 possible measurements and @xmath1 possible measurement outcomes by digits @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "therefore the @xmath5 settings and measurements for each repetition of the experiment are labeled by @xmath5 digit - strings @xmath12 and @xmath13 corresponding to all @xmath5 measurement outcomes and all @xmath5 settings respectively , where @xmath14 denotes the @xmath5-digit string such that the @xmath2-th digit is @xmath15 .    to simplify the analysis",
    "we shall assume initially that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are prime .",
    "we discuss features of the analysis in the non - prime case in appendix [ app2 ] .",
    "we will employ arithmetic in both modulo @xmath0 and modulo @xmath1 . as we are considering correlators obtained by adding measurement outcomes",
    ", the majority of the arithmetic will be modulo @xmath1 .",
    "therefore we use the following convention . in all expressions , arithmetic will be modulo @xmath1 , except in exceptional cases where the arithmetic is modulo @xmath0 , which will be denoted with large square brackets and subscript @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath16_c$ ] .",
    "after the data @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been collected from many repetitions of the experiments , conditional probabilities @xmath17 for each value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be calculated . in the initial chsh paper , and in many - body generalizations , rather than studying this full probability distribution , one merely considers the statistics of the parity of the output @xmath6 . here , we shall take a similar course and study correlators @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "when taking a sum over @xmath20 we are performing addition modulo @xmath1 but when taking sums of probabilities or describing anything that is not related to measurement settings or outcomes we are performing standard , natural arithmetic over the reals .",
    "this natural generalization of the chsh - type correlators in also encompasses the well - known collins - gisin - linden - masser - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality for two parties @xcite .",
    "these correlators have a well - defined role when considering the expectation values of joint measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , singling out this one parameter simplifies the problem by reducing the dimensionality of the problem , whilst still capturing interesting properties of the full distribution @xmath17 .    in section [ sec2a ]",
    "we introduce the mathematical framework for describing these correlators , which employs a correspondence between conditional probabilities and stochastic maps . in section [ sec2b ]",
    "we apply this framework and derive the full family of correlators that are possible in lhv theories .",
    "then , in section [ sec2c ] we consider correlators in more general non - signaling theories and derive generalizations of the popescu - rohrlich non - local box @xcite .      before we begin our study of correlators",
    ", we need to introduce some notation and mathematical construction .",
    "the correlators @xmath21 are maps from @xmath5 digit - strings @xmath22 to probability distributions over a single digit @xmath23 .",
    "any stochastic map is a convex combination of deterministic processes , which in this case are functions @xmath24 .",
    "such functions take an  input \" @xmath22 to a single  output \" @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are fields for @xmath0 , @xmath1 prime , these functions can be represented as elements of a vector space .",
    "there are many bases one could choose to represent the function .",
    "perhaps the simplest and cleanest basis is the set of kronecker delta functions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , which equals 1 when @xmath30 and 0 otherwise .",
    "any function can be represented as @xmath31 the @xmath32 possible coefficients correspond to @xmath32 functions .",
    "it will sometimes be convenient for the basis set to include the constant function .",
    "we shall then replace the delta function @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the all - zeros string with the constant function to write @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the natural expression for the computational power of correlators in a general theory is how close they can approximate an arbitrary function . therefore we want to be able to rewrite as a polynomial .",
    "this can be done as the kronecker delta @xmath38 can be written as a polynomial ( modulo @xmath0 ) , @xmath39_{c},\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left[1-\\sum_{l=0}^{(c-1)}(-1)^{l}{{c-1}\\choose{l}}(y_{j})^{l}(s_{j})^{c-(l+1)}\\right]_{c}. \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first line follows from fermat s little theorem , as @xmath40 mod @xmath41 if @xmath42 is non - zero and @xmath41 is prime . to reach the second line we have used the binomial theorem which follows from the distributivity of modular arithmetic .",
    "this shows us that any function @xmath43 can be expressed as a polynomial with mixed modular arithmetic systems .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath44 we can write the function solely in terms of modulo @xmath1 arithmetic since equation holds for any prime @xmath45 .    in this paper , the following class of functions , which we term the `` @xmath5-partite linear functions '' , will be crucial in the study of lhv theories .",
    "[ defn : local - function ] a function @xmath46 is an @xmath5-*partite linear function * if it can be expressed as @xmath47where addition is modulo @xmath1 and the @xmath48 are functions @xmath49 of a single variable .",
    "if @xmath43 is not an @xmath5-partite linear function , we refer to it as a * * non-**@xmath5 * -partite linear function*.    these functions will play a role analogous to that of the linear boolean functions in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-partite linear functions can also be written as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "there are @xmath53 @xmath5-partite linear functions . for @xmath0 being prime",
    ", the key feature of a non-@xmath5-partite linear function is the presence of cross - multiplicative terms in between different digits @xmath54 of @xmath7 .    for non - prime @xmath0",
    ", we can not write delta functions in the neat polynomial of but in a more elaborate fashion ( see appendix [ app2 ] ) but we can still work in terms of the delta functions for non - prime @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the definition of an @xmath5-partite linear function in applies for non - prime @xmath0 .",
    "thus for prime and non - prime @xmath0 , the delta functions @xmath55 only singularly define a value of @xmath43 when there is only one non - zero element in @xmath7 . for other values of @xmath7",
    "there is addition modulo @xmath1 between the terms @xmath55 .",
    "equivalently then , for @xmath43 to be a non-@xmath5-partite linear function , there must be at least one delta function @xmath38 in [ eqn : f_delta ] with @xmath56 being a digit - string with more than one non - zero element .",
    "a function @xmath43 can be written in terms of an @xmath5-partite linear part plus a non-@xmath5-partite linear part ( with addition modulo @xmath1 ) , and if the @xmath5-partite linear part is zero , then @xmath57 for all @xmath7 with only one non - zero element .",
    "finally , we note that the above treatment also applies in a more general setting where instead of setting digit - strings @xmath13 we now have digit - strings @xmath58 .",
    "that is , the number of possible settings , now labeled @xmath59 at each @xmath2th site could now be different from other sites and also non - prime .",
    "the string @xmath7 is now a direct sum ( or cartesian product ) of the registers @xmath60 for each site .",
    "all delta functions as defined can be carried over to this general setting .",
    "thus single site maps and @xmath5-partite linear functions are exactly the same as but for the @xmath2th site , @xmath0 is replaced with @xmath59 .",
    "we now discuss a geometrical picture of the correlators @xmath21 .",
    "the correlators @xmath21 are stochastic maps and so must satisfy the positivity inequalities , i.e. , the set of @xmath61 linear inequalities @xmath62 , for all @xmath63 , @xmath7 . furthermore , as some outcome always occurs for any choice of measurement settings @xmath7 , the correlators must also satisfy the normalization equations , @xmath64 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we then only have @xmath65 independent correlators for each value of @xmath66 , so we omit the correlator @xmath67 and treat the remaining correlators as elements of a vector in a @xmath61-dimensional real space with elements being @xmath21 for @xmath68 .",
    "the space of correlators satisfying the linear inequalities of the positivity conditions @xmath62 and normalisation conditions in this reduced space , @xmath69 , is then a convex polytope labeled @xmath70 .",
    "it is a convex polytope as it is the intersection of the half - spaces defined by these linear inequalities . in any specific theory , the region of allowed correlators , @xmath71 ,",
    "will be a convex subregion of @xmath70 .",

    "recall that we will focus our attention on correlators @xmath21 representing the probability distribution on @xmath83 , the sum modulo @xmath1 of the outputs .",
    "the correlators have the form of a conditional probability and thus a stochastic map , and therefore are characterized by vectors in the space @xmath84 .",
    "the space @xmath84 represents the set of all correlators possible in principle , but for certain theories , not all correlators will be permitted .",
    "the focus of our study is then the regions of correlators which are accessible in lhv theories and in quantum theories .",
    "the region of lhv correlators is itself a polytope , and the facet - defining inequalities represent the facet - defining bell inequalities@xcite .",
    "this is the geometrical picture of bell inequalities that we will consider in the next subsection .",
    "we now study and characterize the region of correlators in lhv theories .",
    "lhv theories are theories in which the measurement outcomes at each site can depend on the input setting of the measurement .",
    "the only other parameter the outcome depends on is an objective `` hidden variable '' @xmath85 which we assume is shared by all parties , and where @xmath86 is the ( often continuous ) set which defines the possible values for this variable .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath87 is deterministic , but allow it to satisfy a probability distribution @xmath88 over the space @xmath86 such that @xmath89 . without loss of generality @xcite , we assume that apart from the probability distribution over @xmath87 the internal workings of each measurement device is deterministic . this , via a standard argument , results in conditional probabilities for the set of outputs @xmath6 of the following form , @xmath90 since @xmath87 is the only non - deterministic element to consider , we can study the lhv correlations as the convex combination of the set of possible deterministic maps .",
    "we now prove that the map from measurement settings to correlators in any lhv theory is a probabilistic combination of @xmath5-partite linear functions .    in an @xmath5-party generalized bell experiment , with @xmath0 settings and @xmath1 outputs for each measurement , the region @xmath91 of correlators accessible in a lhv theory",

    "the space @xmath91 of correlators is a convex polytope , we only need to find the extreme points of the polytope , or deterministic correlators , and take their convex hull @xcite .",
    "this means we just need to find the deterministic functions possible with lhv correlators .",
    "these deterministic functions correspond to adding the measurement outcomes of space - like separated sites , which , for a lhv theory , is deterministic if and only if the maps from the measurement setting @xmath3 to the measurement outcome @xmath4 at each site is deterministic , i.e. , of the form @xmath92 in definition [ defn : local - function ] for all @xmath2 .",

    "it shows that @xmath91 is compactly characterized by considering it in terms of the computational expressiveness of lhv correlators ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for a schematic of the consequences of theorem 1 ) . in other words , if one considers the bell experiment as a computation , lhv theories allow the computation of @xmath5-partite linear functions and nothing more . from this perspective ,",
    "lhv theories have limited computational power , and thus a theory that allows correlators outside this region can be perceived as having a _ computational advantage _ in a bell experiment .    as mentioned above , there is a dual description of a convex polytope in terms of linear inequalities .",
    "the convex polytope of lhv correlators @xmath91 is the intersection of the half - spaces described by the set of facet - defining bell inequalities ( or facet bell inequalities for short ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we illustrate the different types of bell inequalities which one can construct , and the terminology to classify them .",
    "bell inequalities that are equivalent to normalization or positivity conditions ( i.e the boundaries of @xmath70 ) are referred to as trivial bell inequalities .",
    "there remain bell inequalities that are neither necessarily facet - defining or trivial , which we call _ non - trivial _ bell inequalities ; they are non - trivial because they indicate a separation between the polytopes @xmath70 and @xmath91 by bounding the latter .",

    "for example , it is well - known that some quantum correlators violate a bell inequality @xcite .",
    "also if we observe a violation of a non - trivial inequality then we know that it is outside of @xmath91 .",
    "to recapitulate , for either non - trivial or facet bell inequalities , _ we associate a violation with a computational advantage _ and in section [ sec3 ] we consider bell inequalities from this computational perspective .    before investigating bell inequalities",
    ", it is worth considering the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath17 . since the latter is more general than the former ,",
    "we are excluding interesting phenomena by only considering correlators .",
    "examples of interesting phenomena in the full @xmath17 setting include the @xmath93 inequality @xcite which has interesting implications with regards to quantum correlations ; another example is the guess your neighbor s input @xcite non - local game which results in some facet bell inequalities that are not violated by any quantum correlators . in spite of these examples , we argue in the next subsection that the correlators @xmath21 capture many important phenomena of full non - signaling probability distributions . in particular , we show that particular deterministic correlators can be uniquely associated with a single non - signaling distribution , that being a many - body generalization of the pr non - local box @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we shall consider general non - signaling theories .",
    "these are theories in which there are no constraints on correlations other than the no - signaling conditions .",
    "first , note that given any deterministic correlator @xmath94 where @xmath95 , there exists a non - signaling distribution such that @xmath96 and the non - signaling distribution results in the correlator .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm : generalized - pr ] , proven below , but can be understood intuitively since every possible value of @xmath20 is consistent with one of more output strings @xmath6 where @xmath97 .",
    "one can then take a suitable mixture of these strings such that every output digit is maximally uncertain . since a maximally uncertain output carries no information about @xmath7 , the no - signaling condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "we denote the space of probability distributions @xmath17 that satisfy the no - signaling conditions by @xmath98 ( the indices will normally be omitted for clarity ) .",
    "this space is a convex polytope as it is the intersection of the half - spaces defined by the linear inequalities being the normalization , positivity and non - signaling inequalities ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "finding the vertices of this polytope is the dual problem of finding the facet - defining linear inequalities corresponding to some vertices ( e.g. finding the facet bell inequalities ) which is an np - hard problem .",
    "we now discuss some of the vertices of @xmath99 without resorting to this vertex enumeration problem in the following discussion .",
    "a famous example of a non - signaling distribution which can not be simulated by lhv or quantum correlators for two spatially separated systems is the pr non - local box .",
    "the pr box is defined as a black box that results in measurement outcomes according to the probability distribution , @xmath100 the pr box is described by the correlator @xmath101 . in other words , the pr box is associated with a correlator in @xmath102 . this correlator is a vertex of @xmath102 corresponding to the deterministic property that the parity of outputs @xmath103 and @xmath104 is equal to the product of the inputs @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "the structure of the high dimensional space of all possible non - signaling distributions can be partly revealed by considering the space of correlators , which are of relatively low dimension .",
    "note that the difficulty in ascertaining the remaining structure of @xmath99 comes from the difficulty of finding the set of vertices that generate vertices of @xmath70 that correspond to bi - partite linear functions and determining whether this gives a complete list of vertices .",

    "given this framework , we want to look at the correlators that are achievable with quantum theory .",
    "it is well - known that there exists quantum mechanical correlators that can not be described by correlators resulting from an lhv theory , and this is demonstrated by the violation of a bell inequality @xcite . therefore we now devote our attention to the bell inequalities .",

    "the normalization and positivity inequalities defined in section [ sec2b ] define part of @xmath91 , the lhv polytope . however , these inequalities are also satisfied by all possible correlators @xmath21 and define the polytope @xmath70 of all correlators . these inequalities",

    "we call @xmath169 the maximum value of the sum on the left - hand - side over correlators in @xmath70 . for the bell inequality to be non - trivial , we require @xmath170 .",
    "if a correlator exists outside the lhv polytope , then it violates at least one facet bell inequality .",
    "finding facet bell inequalities involves an optimization of the parameters @xmath171 in and in general is an np - hard problem @xcite .",

    "these optimization algorithms are often used to characterize the non - signaling @xcite and lhv polytopes @xcite in full probability distribution settings .",
    "we used polymake to find the facet bell inequalities for a number of small @xmath9 settings .",
    "the number of facet bell inequalities for each setting is listed in tab . [",
    "tab : tab1 ] , which shows that the number of inequalities grows rapidly in the size of the problem .",
    "the smallest value of non - prime @xmath1 is @xmath172 and so we studied the structure of the lhv polytope for the @xmath173 setting which has @xmath174 @xmath5-partite linear functions corresponding to the vertices of the lhv polytope .",
    "there are @xmath175 facet bell inequalities for this setting found with polymake @xcite which reduces to @xmath176 symmetry classes ( @xmath177 excluding the class of normalization and positivity inequalities ) .",

    "indeed , this fact has been vital in the proof of theorem [ thm : generalized - pr ] , so this proof fails for non - prime @xmath1 . however , for other aspects of the methods in this paper , a non - prime @xmath1 has little consequence for our construction of correlators .",
    "there are two approaches to considering non - prime @xmath1 : the most obvious approach is just to think of representing outcomes as a string of digits from prime number registers as with the description of settings above ; secondly , instead of having the elements @xmath43 of a function as elements of a vector in a vector space over @xmath26 for prime @xmath1 , we now have elements of a _ module _ over @xmath26 ; a generalization of a vector space .",
    "since we only ever take addition of functions represented in a kronecker delta function basis to generate all functions , all of our methods generalize to these modules .    from the aspect of functions , the only difference for non - prime @xmath1",
    "is the fact that @xmath184 in can now take values from a non - prime register @xmath26 .",
    "the derivation of all functions and @xmath5-partite linear functions generalizes naturally . for @xmath185 with the smallest non - prime @xmath186 , we present the facet bell inequalities",
    ". there are four symmetry classes for this setting of which one is the class of positivity and normalization inequalities .",
    "one of these three non - trivial symmetry classes is formed by the cglmp inequality .",
    "the second is another generalization of the chsh inequality and is of the form : @xmath187\\leq 2,\\ ] ] which is essentially the chsh inequality if each party groups their outcomes @xmath20 into modulo @xmath188 terms . in other words , since @xmath189 mod @xmath188 is equal to @xmath190 mod @xmath188 , the above inequality is equivalent to the chsh inequality if each party just maps from mod @xmath172 arithmetic to mod @xmath188 .",
    "the third and final symmetry class is generated by the following inequality ( expressed in the notation described earlier ) : @xmath191 the deterministic map or function @xmath43 that achieves the maximal upper bound @xmath192 of this inequality for all correlators in @xmath70 is @xmath193 .",
    "it is worth noting that this can be constructed by adding @xmath194 to the previous inequality ."
