    "the most successful scheme used to date to classify galaxies is the morphological classification of hubble  @xcite .",
    "the utility of this simple classification scheme ( a compression of the available morphological types to approximately seven classes ) has become apparent through its application to numerous extragalactic studies .",
    "spectral classifications have a number of natural advantages over the morphological classifications of hubble in that they are more easily related to the physical processes that are ongoing within a galaxy ( e.g. , star formation ) and that they do not require us to obtain high resolution imaging of a large number of galaxies . as such",
    ", they are well suited to studying the cores of galaxies in the distant universe .    as was found for the classification of the spectra of stars , classifying the spectra of more complicated systems such as galaxies or quasars ( qsos ) can provide a better understanding of the physical processes that determine the formation and evolution of these sources . moreover ,",
    "if there exist mechanisms by which galaxies can be classified using a handful of representative parameters , this classification can be thought of as a compression of the information contained within the spectra . from such an approach",
    ", one might be able to derive simple mechanisms for exploring the physics of the spectral properties of galaxies using large data sets .",
    "recent massive spectroscopic surveys , e.g. , the anglo - australian observatory 2-degree - field ( 2df ) galaxy survey ( colless et  al .",
    "2001 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) provide us with the opportunity to address the classification of galaxy spectra using hundreds of thousands of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "one technique that has gained popularity for studying the distribution of seds is the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform .",
    "the power of this approach is that it enables a large amount of data to be decomposed and compressed into independent components in an objective way .",
    "applications of this technique can be found in the classifications of galaxies ( connolly et  al .",

    "as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( york et  al .  2000 ) spectra are taken with fibers of 3 arcsec diameter ( corresponding to 0.18 mm at the focal plane for the 2.5 m , f/5 telescope ) .",

    "2002 ) , the luminous red galaxy sample ( lrgs ; eisenstein et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and the qso sample ( richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) . from these data we select the main galaxy sample for our analysis and use only those galaxies defined as being of survey quality : a signal - to - noise lower - limit of approximately 16 .",
    "the galaxies in this sample have r - band petrosian magnitudes @xmath2 and petrosian half - light surface brightnesses @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , defined to be the mean surface brightness within a circular aperture containing half of the petrosian flux ( called the petrosian half - light radius ) .",
    "the spectral reductions used are the standard sdss 2d analysis pipeline ( idlspec2d v4.9.8 , as of 18th of april , 2002 ) and the 1d specbs pipeline ( schlegel et  al .",
    "the resultant spectra are flux- and wavelength - calibrated , and sky - subtracted . from these data",
    "approximately two hundred galaxies are removed , as they have zero flux in all pixels .",
    "this results in a final sample of 176,956 galaxy spectra .",
    "the median redshift is about 0.1 , and we find that about 6.5% of the sample have redshifts @xmath5  kms@xmath6 , so that their petrosian half - light radii can be substantially larger than the 3 arcsec aperture of the fiber ( strauss et  al .",
    "1,854 spectra of the final sample are found to be duplicated observations ; identified as being within a search radius of 2 arcsec and a redshift tolerance of 0.01 .",

    "the binning of the spectra is logarithmic , with a velocity dispersion of 69  kms@xmath6 .",
    "this procedure emphasizes the blue end of the optical spectrum , enabling our analysis to focus on the ca  h and ca  k lines , and the balmer break .",
    "the resultant spectra cover rest - wavelength range @xmath7    over 3839 pixels .",
    "the karhunen - love transform ( or principal component analysis , pca ) is a powerful technique used in classification and dimensional reduction of data . in astronomy ,",
    "its applications in studies of multivariate distributions have been discussed in detail ( efstathiou & fall  1984 ; murtagh & heck  1987 ) . in this paper , we limit ourselves to its applications to spectral energy distributions . the basic idea is to derive a lower dimensional set of _ eigenspectra _ @xcite from a very large set of input seds .",
    "each sed can be thought of as an axis in a multidimensional hyperspace , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the @xmath10-th wavelength in the @xmath11-th galaxy spectrum .    for the moment",
    ", we assume that there are no gaps in each spectrum ; we will discuss the ways we deal with gappy regions later . from the set of spectra we construct the correlation matrix",
    "@xmath12    where the summation is from @xmath13 to the total number of spectra , and @xmath14 is the normalized @xmath11-th spectrum , defined for a given @xmath11 as , @xmath15    the eigenspectra are obtained by finding a matrix , @xmath16 , such that @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix .",
    "@xmath16 is thus a matrix whose @xmath11-th column consists of the @xmath11-th eigenspectrum @xmath19 .",
    "we solve this eigenvalue problem by using singular value decomposition .",
    "the observed spectra are projected on to the eigenspectra to obtain the eigencoefficients . in these projections ,",
    "every pixel in each spectrum is weighted by the error associated with that particular pixel , @xmath20 , such that the weights are given by @xmath21 .",
    "the observed spectra can be decomposed , with no error , as follows @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the total number of eigenspectra .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath23 equals the total number of wavelength bins in the spectrum .",
    "previously , we assumed that the spectra are without any gaps . in reality , however , there are several reasons for gaps to exist : for example , different rest - wavelength coverages , the removal of sky lines , bad pixels on the ccd chips etc .",
    "leave gaps at different rest frame wavelengths for each spectrum .",
    "all can contribute to incomplete spectra .",
    "the principle behind the gap - correction process is to reconstruct the gappy spectrum using its principal components .",
    "the first application of the method to analyze galaxy spectra is due to connolly and szalay  ( 1999a ) , which expands on a formalism developed by everson and sirovich for dealing with two - dimensional images @xcite .",
    "initially , we fix the gap regions by some means , for example , linear - interpolation . a set of eigenspectra are then constructed from the gap - repaired galaxy spectra . afterward , the gaps in the original spectra are corrected with the linear combination of the kl eigenspectra .",
    "the whole process is iterated until the eigenspectra converge , which we define in the next section . according to everson and sirovich s work on",
    "artificially masked two - dimensional images , they claimed that the iteration process gives convergent images .",
    "however , the question about whether the principal components resulting from the correction procedure on realistic gappy galaxy spectra would converge is unknown and is to be addressed with this work .",
    "there are some questions to be solved in our analysis before the kl eigenspectra and hence the classification itself become robust and meaningful .",
    "these questions are : do the resultant eigenspectra converge and , if so , how many iteration steps are required , what is the dependency of the quality of the kl - repaired spectra on how the gaps are initially corrected , how much information is contained in the eigenspectra and most importantly , how many galaxy spectra are needed in order to derive a convergent set of eigenspectra ?",
    "several authors have tried to assess the performance of a kl analysis in a number of different quantitative ways .",
    "an example of this is the @xmath24 assessment @xcite in which the authors calculated the difference between the observed spectrum and the spectrum reconstructed with the principal components in order to determine the number of components needed for reconstructing a quasar spectrum . with the implementation of gap - corrections in our analysis , this comparison of only _",
    "one _ spectrum to another may not suffice .",
    "we are more interested in how well the _ set _ of eigenspectra describes the distribution of spectra rather than a one - to - one comparison .",
    "for example , how does the set of eigenspectra differ as the gap - correction procedure progresses ? given two subspaces , each formed by a set of eigenspectra obtained with different conditions ( e.g. , at different points in the iterative gap correction or computed with different numbers of observed spectra ) , we require a method that will quantitatively compare one set of eigenspectra with another .",
    "in other words , instead of just comparing two spectra , a mechanism is desired to compare two subspaces , which are spanned by a finite number of spectra respectively .",
    "mathematically it can be stated , as in @xcite , that two spaces , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are in common if @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the sum of projection operators of space @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , and @xmath30 is equal to the dimensionality of each space .",
    "we assume that these eigenbases have the same dimensions for a meaningful comparison .",
    "the sum of the projection operators , @xmath28 , of a space is given by the sum of the outer products @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the basis vectors which span the space @xmath25 ( e.g. , merzbacher 1970 ) .",
    "a basis vector is an eigenspectrum if @xmath25 is considered to be a set of eigenspectra .",
    "the two spaces are disjoint if the trace quantity is zero and are identical if the quantity is equal to the dimension of the subspace .",
    "this provides a quantitative way of measuring the commonality of two subspaces ( i.e. , how similar the two subspaces are ) .        in investigating the convergence behavior of eigenspectra as a function of the number of iterations",
    ", we define one of the spaces to be that formed by a finite number of eigenspectra obtained after initially interpolating over the gap regions , but _ without _ gap correction .",
    "the other spaces are defined to be those formed by the same finite number of eigenspectra but at different iterations in the gap correction .",
    "the sum of projection operators in the first case is named @xmath33 and in the latter , @xmath34 .",
    "the subspaces are named @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath11-th iteration .",
    "the dimension of the space is @xmath37 , which is the number of eigenspectra forming the subspace .    the trace quantity @xmath38 as a function of iteration is plotted in figure  [ fig : eigspectracede]a , in which the kl transform is applied to @xmath39 randomly - chosen sdss galaxy spectra , where @xmath37 is set to be @xmath40 and @xmath41 , meaning that the subspaces are spanned by the the first five and the first ten eigenspectra respectively . repairing of the galaxy spectra in the iteration procedure is performed with @xmath42 eigenspectra .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath43 is independent from @xmath37 and that @xmath37 is always smaller or equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the traces are normalized by the corresponding @xmath37 in each curve to simplify comparison .",
    "initially , let us concentrate on the curves with open symbols in figure  [ fig : eigspectracede ] .",
    "these curves denote that the initial gappy regions are approximated by linear - interpolation . in this linear - interpolation method the flux of a pixel , @xmath44 , in the gap is simply approximated by the average of its neighbors , so that @xmath45    the trace quantity decreases gradually as the iteration step increases , indicating that the space @xmath36 is less and less in common with @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the kl gap - correction and eigenspectra construction are changing the spectrum of a galaxy within the gappy regions .",
    "as such the eigenspectra from the kl - repaired spectra differ progressively more from those formed from the original spectra .",
    "the above is true for both @xmath46 and @xmath41 .",
    "the above is generally valid for @xmath37 from @xmath47 . as the iteration increases , the slope of the curve decreases , which implies that a we have converging set of eigenspectra .",
    "the choice of linear - interpolation in the initial correction for the gappy regions is arbitrary .",
    "in fact , if the gap formalism is robust , the quality of the kl - repaired spectrum and the eigenspectra should be independent of the way the observed spectra are initially repaired .",
    "we test an alternative method of correcting for gaps , where the flux at each wavelength bin in the gap region is approximated by the mean of all other spectra within that region , i.e. , the flux of a pixel in a gap is approximated by , @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the normalized flux at @xmath50 .",
    "we call this method mean - interpolation . with this alternate method",
    "the trace quantity also converges as we can see from figure  [ fig : eigspectracede]a , but at a higher value than those in the case of linear - interpolation .",
    "this behavior shows that , in the case of mean - interpolation , the eigenspectra constructed after the gap correction deviate _",
    "less _ from the initial interpolated spectra than in the case of linear - interpolation .",
    "the rate of convergence is faster when using the mean - interpolation method .",
    "this suggests that the mean - interpolation provides a better initial estimate of the true spectra within the gap regions .",
    "we do not , therefore , require as many iterations as in the case of linear - interpolation .",
    "this is important as each step in repairing the spectra and constructing the eigenspectra is computationally expensive when large amounts of data are under consideration .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigspectracede]b shows the convergence behavior of the sets of eigenspectra given in figure  [ fig : eigspectracede]a except that the trace quantity now compares the subspace from one iteration to the subspace from the next iteration , i.e. , @xmath51 . as expected , the convergence with the number of iteration steps can be seen in both methods , but with this more sensitive measurement the convergence is now no longer found to be monotonic .",
    "this implies that we may need more iterations , than it first appeared from our previous example in order to obtain a convergent set of eigenspectra .",
    "again , the mean - interpolation method is shown to converge to a consistent set of eigenspectra faster than for linear - interpolation .",
    "consequently , in the following all gaps in the spectra will be fixed using the mean - interpolation method , unless otherwise specified .",
    "an example of the actual performance in the mean - interpolated and repaired spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : mirepairedspec ] .",
    "the data set is the same @xmath52 galaxies as before , except that one randomly chosen spectrum is artificially masked in the region [ 4500 , 5000] .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mirepairedspec]a shows that the mean - interpolated region is already close to that of the original spectrum before masking .",
    "the lower panel shows the kl - repaired spectrum at @xmath53 overlaid on the original spectrum , using all @xmath41 eigenspectra .",
    "the spectra are offset by an arbitrary amount for illustration .",
    "there is a substantial improvement in retrieving the original spectrum as the iterations proceed . to compare the kl - repaired and unmasked spectrum quantitatively",
    ", we apply a similar convergence measure as described previously . the convergence measure in this case",
    "is defined to be @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the projector of the kl - repaired spectrum with @xmath43 eigenspectra in the gaps , and @xmath56 is that of the unmasked spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig : mirepairedspec]b , the trace quantity versus the number of iterations is plotted for the case corresponding to figure  [ fig : mirepairedspec]a .",
    "@xmath57 means that the repaired spectrum is identical with the original unmasked one .",
    "we see that after the initial few iterations , the two become more similar .",
    "after 30 iterations , the kl - repaired spectrum converges to that of the original spectrum with a high degree of accuracy , the difference in the trace quantities of @xmath58  % .        combining the results of the convergence measures in both kl - repaired spectra and the previously discussed eigenspectra",
    ", it can be concluded that the convergence of the eigenspectra implies the convergence of the repaired spectrum , and vise versa .",
    "furthermore , the quality of a repaired spectrum should not depend on the initial gap - interpolation technique .",
    "figure  [ fig : milirepairedspec ] shows the kl - repaired spectra , using linear- and mean - interpolations for the initial gap approximation , @xmath42 and at @xmath53 .",
    "the two are shown to be very similar to each other .",
    "the insert shows the corresponding @xmath59 as a function of iteration .",
    "the convergence behavior seems different in both cases , nevertheless they are approaching each other with a difference in the actual value about 0.3% which is small as can be seen in the plots of the spectra in the main graph .",
    "this is a desired result , because if the whole formalism is robust , the repaired spectrum should not be different due to different procedures used in the initial gap - fixing .",
    "another important aspect of the kl - eigenspectra construction is the number of observed spectra necessary as the input . in principal , as we increase the number of galaxy spectra , a more representative and general set of eigenspectra should result .",
    "the question remains , however , how much more generality would be gained by including more observed spectra in the analysis ?",
    "fundamentally , does there exist a minimum number of input galaxy spectra such that the eigenspectra set start to converge ?",
    "this is important because we can thus use a minimum number of randomly - chosen observed spectra in the survey to derive a set of eigenspectra which nevertheless contain all the necessary information within the full data set .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigentrace_2310_newn ] shows an attempt to answer this question . in these figures , the commonality percentages of two subspaces spanned by ( a ) @xmath60 ( b ) @xmath61 and ( c ) @xmath41 eigenspectra are plotted versus the number of galaxy spectra n@xmath62 used in the sample .",
    "the commonality is similar to that previously discussed for the trace quantities except here we compare the set of eigenspectra derived from n@xmath62 input galaxy spectra with that from a smaller number of spectra n@xmath63 .",
    "this is defined as follows @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the sum of projectors of the subspace spanned by @xmath66 eigenspectra , derived from @xmath67 galaxy spectra , using @xmath68 eigenspectra for gap - repairing .",
    "the number of iterations for the gap - correction is 20 .",
    "the smallest number of spectra we consider is @xmath69 ( = n@xmath70 ) and the largest number @xmath71 .",
    "the galaxies in each case are randomly selected from the full sdss sample .        for all cases ,",
    "convergent trends are present as more spectra are included .",
    "for the case of two eigenspectra ( figure  [ fig : eigentrace_2310_newn]a ) we can see that only about @xmath72 galaxy spectra are needed in order to construct the first two eigenspectra to an 0.5% accuracy when compared to the final converged set .",
    "the inclusion of the third mode ( figure  [ fig : eigentrace_2310_newn]b ) requires more spectra to obtain a similar accuracy though the convergence behavior is very similar to ( a ) ( with slightly larger fluctuations ) . nevertheless , only about @xmath73 galaxy spectra",
    "are needed for 90% commonality .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that most types of galaxy spectra can be described with 2 to 3 colors @xcite and therefore a random sampling of a few thousand galaxies can be expected to cover the full color distribution for these galaxies .    in figure ( c ) , it is interesting that the convergent behavior is different from that in ( a ) and ( b ) . with a sample size smaller than about @xmath74 to @xmath75 ,",
    "the improvement in the set of 10 eigenspectra is small .",
    "however , once the number of spectra used exceeds that threshold , the convergent rate dramatically increases .",
    "this finding suggests that there exists a minimum number of galaxy spectra that we need to include in our kl analysis in order to fully sample the true distribution of galaxy spectra . combining this with the fact that the higher - order modes in the eigenspectra tend to correspond to spectral features in galaxies with prominent emission lines ( this will be discussed in detail in section  [ section : kl ] ) and the fact that those galaxies only comprise about 0.1% of the whole sample , the behavior in ( c ) can be understood as the effect of including galaxies with relatively extreme spectral properties .",
    "when we randomly pick about @xmath73 galaxies from the sample there are a few emission line galaxies . as more spectra",
    "are included we eventually reach a threshold where we begin to sample the extreme emission line galaxies .",
    "once we have included a small number of these emission line galaxies ( with a sample size of @xmath76 galaxies we would expect three to four emission line galaxies ) the information they contain is now incorporated within the kl eigenbases . the dramatic increase in the convergence rate come from the fact that , while rare , these extreme emission line galaxies can still be described by a handful of spectral components ( i.e. , once we have a small number of them in the sample we can map out their full distribution ) .    to conclude , there exist a minimum number of galaxy spectra we need to observe in order to derive a convergent set of eigenspectra .",
    "approximately @xmath77 spectra are sufficient for a 90% convergence level with ten eigen - components ( figure  [ fig : eigentrace_2310_newn]c ) .",
    "this is sufficient to characterize the spectral types of 99.9% of galaxies within the local universe .",
    "these results are , however , purely empirical , based on randomly selecting spectra from the current data set .",
    "thus , there is no concrete evidence to support the present result that @xmath77 galaxy spectra are all we need in deriving the most complete set of eigenspectra",
    ". there may exist populations of galaxies that comprise much less that 0.1% of the full galaxy sample that our current analysis is not sensitive to .",
    "in general , for a larger data set ( e.g. , at the completion of the survey ) , new galaxy types , if any , may call for more spectra to be included when constructing the eigenspectra .",
    "the first @xmath41 kl eigenspectra of the 170,000 sdss galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig:10eigspec ] , derived from @xmath79 iterations and using 10 eigenspectra for gap repairing .",
    "the eigenspectra are publicly available ( from the website http://www.sdss.org ) .",
    "the first eigenspectrum is the mean of all galaxy spectra in our sample .",
    "the continuum is similar to a sb - type . as we would expect from the mean of all spectra , nebular lines and other emission lines , as well as absorption lines such as ca  h and ca  k , are present within this spectrum .",
    "the second eigenspectrum has one zero crossing , positive toward longer wavelengths , at around 5200 , which marks the wavelength at which the modulation in the continuum level relative to the 1st eigenspectrum occurs . in the third component , there is a zero crossing in the continuum , negative toward longer wavelengths , at around 6000 .",
    "the higher the order of the eigenspectrum , the larger the number of zero crossings which in turn adds high - frequency features to the final spectrum as these higher order modes are added or subtracted . in the higher - order modes ,",
    "the eigenspectra are dominated by emission and absorption lines because each of these eigenspectra comprises emission and absorption lines plus a small fluctuation of the continuum level around zero .",
    "we illustrate this point later in the paper .",
    "statistically , the amount of information contained in each eigenspectrum is given by the eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of that particular mode .",
    "table  [ tab : weight ] lists the weights of the first @xmath43-modes of eigenspectra , where the weights are normalized to unity .",
    "we find that the first three eigenspectra contain more than @xmath80 of the total variance of the data set .",
    "it is known that there is a one - parameter description of galaxy spectra which correlates with the spectral type of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "this parameter , @xmath81 , is the mixing angle of the first and second eigencoefficients .",
    "explicitly , @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the eigencoefficients of the first and second modes of a galaxy respectively .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of the third component discriminates the post - starburst activity @xcite . to follow this classification scheme ,",
    "we define here @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the third eigencoefficient . here",
    "we adopt the normalization @xmath87                the first three eigencoefficients of the whole sample are plotted in figures  [ fig : a2vsa1 ] and [ fig : a3vsa2 ] in the forms of @xmath84 versus @xmath83 and @xmath86 versus @xmath84 .",
    "more than 99% of the total galaxy population is located on the locus in figures  [ fig : a2vsa1 ] , in which the second eigencoefficients have values from @xmath88 0.25 to -0.75 .",
    "the appearance of this locus is very similar to previous works @xcite .",
    "red galaxies have positive , and relatively large second eigencoefficients , while blue galaxies have smaller , or in some cases negative values . from figure",
    "[ fig : a3vsa2 ] we clearly see that by introducing the third eigen - component , there is a group of galaxies being separated out from the main group .",
    "these galaxies , with negative @xmath86 and negative @xmath84 values , exhibit post - starburst activity in their spectra . a much smaller group ( about 0.1% ) with positive @xmath86 and negative @xmath84 values is also seen .",
    "these are outliers and will be discussed later .",
    "the resulting @xmath81 versus @xmath89 is plotted in figure  [ fig : phitheta ] for all galaxies in the sample excluding those galaxies with @xmath90 ( 118 objects ) .",
    "these @xmath90 sources tend to be either artifacts within the data ( m.  subbarao , private communication ) or spectra that are not visually confirmed as a galaxy spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig : phitheta]a , the sequence from red to blue to extreme emission line galaxies is illustrated .",
    "the boxes drawn show the regions from which a set of spectral types are identified .",
    "they range from the early - type at the top of the plot to emission line galaxies at the bottom .",
    "the spectra for these subsamples are shown in figure  [ fig : meanspec](a - f ) , ranging from red to emission line galaxies .",
    "the spectral energy distributions shown are the mean of all the _ observed _ spectra classified to be in the range ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) , where the superscripts @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the starting and ending values bounding the range .",
    "the actual values are chosen such that the resultant mean spectra agree with the galaxy spectra of each type in kennicutt s atlas of nearby galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "the flux levels are in good agreement with those in the atlas , which leads us to believe that the classification is physically sound as well as having statistical rigor .",
    "spectra with similar spectral features are therefore seen to be clustered by the kl procedure . due to the smoothing of spectral inhomogeneities with a large number of galaxies , the resultant mean spectra have very high signal - to - noise levels .",
    "this result demonstrates the power of the kl transform for calculating mean ( or composite ) spectra ( e.g. , eisenstein et al .",
    "2003 for the mean spectrum of the sdss massive galaxies ) .",
    "table  [ tab : number ] shows the number of observed galaxy spectra in each of the regions described previously .",
    "we stress that the sum of all galaxies listed in the table is not equal to the total number of galaxies in the data set because the ranges chosen comprise a subset of the full ( @xmath97)-plane .",
    "the early late- to intermediate late - types galaxies ( with @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) dominate within the whole data set which agrees with the well - known fact that late - type galaxies dominate the field populations in terms of number counts .",
    "apart from the main locus in figure  [ fig : phitheta ] the region marked `` ( b ) '' identifies a group of outliers , forming approximately 0.1% of the full sample ( @xmath100 sources ) .",
    "these are unusual sources that arise due to artifacts within the reduction pipelines , errors within the spectra themselves or possibly due to new classes of astrophysical sources . in later processing runs ( idlspec2d v4.9.8 , as of 13th of august , 2002 ) only 68 of these sources remain in the main galaxy sample",
    ". approximately half of them have the zwarning flag set to 4 , which indicates that there are large errors in the redshift estimations .",
    "this results in less than 0.02% of the spectroscopic sample having spectra that can be considered unphysical ( a testament to the remarkable accuracy and performance of the current spectroscopic reduction pipelines ) .",
    "considering all of these sources as a whole 90% have signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) higher than the mean survey quality ( the @xmath101 is 15.9 in the data set ) .        of the remaining 30 galaxies within this outlier class , most have relatively high redshifts ( @xmath102 ) as assigned by the pipelines . some of these sources classed as galaxies by the pipelines do not appear to be galaxy spectra when inspected visually . on the other hand , for those that _",
    "are _ galaxies as inspected by us , we found that the pipelines have assigned incorrect redshifts to some of these spectra . as expected , the gap - repairing procedure fails in those objects and the resulting expansion coefficients have unphysical values .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : weirdspec_176455.eps ] , according to the assigned redshift , this object has a redshift @xmath103 , which is obviously incorrect from the locations of + h@xmath104 + lines , as shown in the insert ( this galaxy should have a redshift of @xmath105 ) .",
    "the outcome is that the magnitudes of the 2nd and the 3rd eigencoefficients obtained by a kl of all the objects in this group are roughly the same but with different _ signs _ , meaning that no lines that are representative of typical spectral types are found .",
    "this result suggests that kl technique is a powerful tool for identifying artifacts within any spectral reduction procedure .",
    "the above results show that the classification is successful in allowing the galaxy types to be identified using the first three eigencoefficients and that it may serve as a way for error checking .",
    "how do the eigenspectra actually perform in reconstructing the spectra ?",
    "figure  [ fig:3modes](a - f ) shows , for the same range of ( @xmath106 ) as above , the means of all kl - reconstructed spectra .",
    "a kl - reconstructed spectrum , using @xmath43-eigenspectra , is given by @xmath107        it should be noted that the kl - reconstructed spectrum is different from the kl - repaired spectrum we mentioned previously ( in that case the repairing is in the gap regions only ) .",
    "for convenience , the _",
    "mean _ of all kl - reconstructed spectra in a given range is abbreviated as `` kl - reconstructed spectrum '' in the following sections unless otherwise specified .",
    "comparing the mean spectra in figure  [ fig : meanspec](a - f ) with the reconstructed ones in figure  [ fig:3modes](a - f ) ( 3 modes are used ) , the continuum levels and most emission lines are in excellent agreement with the mean spectra ( except for the galaxies with extreme emissions , which we will discuss later ) .",
    "these results are consistent with previous claims that two eigenspectra are enough to describe most of the spectral types in galaxies @xcite .",
    "our present classification scheme of using two mixing angles of the first three eigencoefficients is also justified .",
    "the 3-mode kl - reconstructed spectra shown in figure  [ fig:3modes](a - f ) also suggest that to reconstruct some of the lines and line ratios , more eigenspectra are necessary .",
    "figure  [ fig : recon_lines_details ] shows in detail the emission lines that require more than 3 modes for reconstruction .",
    "these figures show early - type to late - type galaxies ( from top to bottom ) . with the first eight eigenspectra",
    ", the amplitude of the line for galaxies with classification angles in the range ( 7.5 , 20 , 86 , 92 ) can be correctly recovered .",
    "similarly , the first four modes are sufficient for the and h@xmath104 reconstruction for galaxies with classification angles in the range ( 5 , 6 , 80 , 100 ) . progressing to bluer galaxies with classification angles in the range ( 0 , 2 , 80 , 100 ) , the first eight modes are enough for the reconstruction .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : recon_lines_details_2 ] shows the cases for galaxies with prominent emission features .",
    "we find that the first four modes are enough to reconstruct the amplitudes and line - ratios [ 5008.240]/[4960.295 ] and h@xmath108[4862.68]/[4960.295 ] for those with classification angles in the range ( -12 , -8 , 80 , 100 ) . for galaxies in the range ( -60 , -40 , 120 , 135 ) ,",
    "the line - ratio [ 6585.27]/[6549.86 ] is correct with three eigenspectra , while the first eight modes are enough to further retrieve the amplitudes of the two lines .",
    "the maximum differences between the amplitudes of the mean and the reconstructed lines ( which we define as the error of the reconstruction of a particular line ) in the above - mentioned cases are about 10% .        therefore , for all but the most extreme emission line galaxies , eight spectral components , or modes , are sufficient to reconstruct the spectral line ratios to an accuracy of about 10%  ( a factor of 500 in compression of information within the galaxy spectra ) . for the reconstruction of galaxies with extreme emissions , however , the performance is not satisfactory when using a small number of eigenspectra",
    ". nevertheless , ten eigenspectra are sufficient to recover the continuum level ( see the mean and kl - reconstructed spectra in the enlarged continuum region ) .",
    "the residuals of the mean spectra and the kl - reconstructed spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : sbmresidue ] , where ( a - d ) correspond to the reconstructions with 3 , 4 , 5 and 10 eigenspectra respectively .",
    "there are substantial improvements in using ten eigenspectra , especially in nebular lines and lines , and various line ratios .",
    "the typical errors in the fluxes of lines remains around @xmath109% .",
    "this is not a surprising result .",
    "on one hand , the result follows because of the increasingly dominant role of lines in the higher - order modes compared with the continuum .",
    "on the other hand , statistics also play a factor .",
    "the early and intermediate - type galaxies dominate the population of galaxies while emission and extreme emission line galaxies comprise just a few percent of the total population .",
    "thus , galaxies with significant emission call for more eigenspectra and higher - order modes in their reconstructions . besides the statistical reasons ,",
    "the inevitable variations in line - widths of emission lines make it comparatively difficult to reconstruct them accurately using linear combinations of eigenspectra .",
    "due to the fact that the spectral features in extreme emission line galaxies are distinct from other types of galaxies , they still reveal themselves in the plane ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus , for the main purpose of this work , which is obtaining a robust and objective classification of galaxies , the less satisfactory performance of reconstructing some emission lines in galaxies with extreme emission lines does not have a significant effect .",
    "however , if detailed diagnosis of lines ( for example , the flux - ratio of two lines ) in those galaxies are of interest , then more modes are needed .",
    "better yet , a separate analysis using kl with those emission line galaxies is suggested .",
    "the inclusion of all the modes in the kl - reconstruction of a given spectrum should , in principle , reproduce all spectral features ( including the noise ) .",
    "as higher - order modes contain higher frequency signals and smaller variances of the sample , the inclusion of only a few lower - order modes would thus suppress the noise present in the spectrum .",
    "examples of the comparison between the observed spectra and the kl - reconstructed ones are shown in figure  [ fig : inspec_reconspe_comprandom](a - c ) . in each case , the spectrum is reconstructed with the first 10 eigenspectra , and normalized at 5500 . from these noise - free reconstructed spectra , it becomes a simple task to identify and classify the spectral lines .",
    "any classification scheme has to be repeatable in order to be useful .",
    "if we measure the spectrum of a galaxy on different nights in different conditions , would the classification still be the same ? to answer this question , we are fortunate in that many galaxy spectra in the sdss data set are taken on multiple nights @xcite .",
    "a total of 1,854 galaxies were found in our sample to be not unique ( i.e. , they have been observed and reduced independently ) .",
    "a further thirty thousand galaxies were found in the sdss spectroscopic data to have been observed on multiple nights with different observing conditions ( often these individual observations do not meet the signal - to - noise requirements of the sdss spectral observations ) .",
    "the quantitative interpretation of the repeatability of classifications based on these plates may be difficult due to the variation in signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "nevertheless all repeat observations are selected for this part of our work .",
    "of the thirty - thousand sources , only those with flags primtarget , objtype and class equal galaxy are selected ( together with the requirement that all sources are present in the most up to date reductions ) .",
    "this selection results in thirteen - thousand objects in the final sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : repeat]a and figure  [ fig : repeat]b show a comparison between the @xmath81 and @xmath89 values assigned by our classification scheme to those galaxies with the highest signal - to - noise and the classification derived from the repeat observations .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the location of the one - to - one correspondence between the two measures .",
    "the dispersions in @xmath81 and @xmath89 are @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "this agreement is excellent , as these angle dispersions correspond to small changes in the resulting repaired spectra .",
    "the agreement also spans a large range in both classification angles .",
    "the implication of this finding is that a truly reliable and repeatable classification scheme is obtained which validates the repeatability of the spectrophotometry of the sdss .    in order to determine a representative signal - to - noise ratio for each spectrum",
    "the median signal - to - noise ratio is adopted ( the flag sn_median in spzbest-_plate_-_mjd_.fits ) .",
    "the dependence of the rms error in the measured angles on the signal - to - noise of the observations ( where the signal - to - noise is selected to be the lower one of any pair of observations ) is shown in figure  [ fig : sigsnphitheta ] . from the current data set we observe a weak trend with larger discrepancies in the classification for those observations with lower signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the mean ( absolute ) discrepancies in the classification angles ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) and mean signal - to - noise ratios are calculated in the ranges of signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath114 ) , ( @xmath115 ) , ( @xmath116 ) , ( @xmath117 ) and larger than 30.0 .",
    "the dependence is very similar in both the @xmath81 and @xmath89 angles .",
    "the error bars are set by the root - mean - square fluctuations in both quantities .",
    "the vertical line marks the calculated mean signal - to - noise ratio of all the galaxies defined as meeting the survey quality ( a signal - to - noise of 15.9 ) .        for those sources meeting the survey quality signal - to - noise criteria , the maximum errors in the two mixing angles are , approximately , three degrees in @xmath81 and two degrees in @xmath89 .",
    "this result shows that the classifications based on the sdss spectra are repeatable and robust to the variable signal - to - noise within the spectroscopic data .",
    "the fact that the signal - to - noise dependence is weak suggests that the noise within the spectra are essentially poisson such that the projection of a noisy spectrum does not add substantial artifacts into the expansion coefficients . despite this weak dependence in the distribution of expansion coefficients with signal - to - noise",
    "we do find instances where the spectral properties of the galaxies change between pairs of observations .",
    "for example , in one case we find that the strength of the o  ii lines change by about 20% between two separate observations .",
    "it is not clear whether this difference is due to a calibration error or due to variability in the source .",
    "from studies of the luminosity function of galaxies it has been shown that the distribution of galaxies comprise a number of populations or classes .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to ask how many classes are present within the sdss spectroscopic data and how many galaxies occupy each class .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : phihistogram ] the frequency distribution of @xmath81 , ( for the moment we neglect @xmath89 because the extreme emission line galaxies contribute less than a percent to the full galaxy distribution ) .",
    "the bin width is @xmath118 and the histogram is normalized to unity .",
    "visually , there appear to be two to three dominant `` classes '' or subtypes within the @xmath81-distribution . to further investigate the number of subpopulations",
    ", we adopt the akaike information criterion ( aic ) .",
    "aic is widely used in model selection in a number of different disciplines .",
    "the details of aic and its application in astronomy can be found in connolly  et  al .",
    "basically , in aic , a score is assigned to the model distribution , allowing a quantitative comparison with the true distribution of the data . naturally , more parameters within a model yield a better fit to the data .",
    "to counter this the aic penalizes the score based on the number of parameters within a model .",
    "the aic score is given by the following , @xmath119    for a given model .",
    "in this definition , @xmath120 is the log - likelihood function , and @xmath121 is the number of parameters in the model . as a result ,",
    "the higher is the score the better the model .",
    "the first step in the analysis is to choose a functional form for the model ; a gaussian model is adopted here .",
    "we fit models with increasing numbers of gaussian components to the @xmath81-distribution and show the resultant aic score in figure  [ fig : aicscore ] as a function of the number of gaussians @xmath122 in the linear mixture model .",
    "the insert shows an enlargement of the region around @xmath123 .",
    "we find that for @xmath124 , the scores start to flatten off ( 0.01% difference in the aic score ) , whereas the major improvement occurs at @xmath125 . in a statistical sense ,",
    "@xmath124 give the best score and therefore it would appear that at most six subgroups might contribute to the distribution of the @xmath81 values .",
    "we do note , however , that there is no underlying physical motivation for assuming a gaussian mixture model and that as the number of gaussians in the model exceeds four the individual gaussian contain no direct physical meaning .",
    "that is to say , the individual populations for @xmath126 actually overlap , forming redundant descriptions .",
    "thus , we estimate that a linear model of a mixture of three gaussians is sufficient for modeling the populations of galaxies in our data set .",
    "the form of the model is as follows @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the number density ( normalized , @xmath129 ) as a function of @xmath81 , and @xmath130 is a gaussian function of @xmath81 @xmath131}^2 } \\ .\\ ] ]        the three gaussians are illustrated by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : phihistogram ] . comparing the mean values ( in @xmath81 ) of the gaussian distributions with the ranges of @xmath81 over which the mean spectra of different galaxy types are derived",
    "( see figure  [ fig : meanspec ] , also see table  [ tab : number ] ) , these distributions correspond approximately to early through to intermediate types . because the first two eigenspectra , i.e. , @xmath81 , roughly describe the color of a galaxy",
    ", the different sub - populations we obtain should relate to the color separation found in the sdss edr galaxies @xcite in which the bimodal @xmath132 color distribution corresponds to early- ( e , s0 and sa ) and late- ( sb , sc and irr ) types @xcite . besides , optical colors of all galaxies in the sdss were found to be correlated very strongly with @xmath133 color ( i.e. , the @xmath134 color for galaxies at redshift @xmath135 ) , which was also found to be double - peaked @xcite .",
    "as we have shown , the eigencoefficients that describe a galaxy spectrum correlate strongly with its intrinsic spectral type .",
    "we will leave for a later paper a detailed investigation of the correlations inherent within the eigenbases and their relations to physical spectral energy distribution models such as bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) . in the following section we will just note a number of the interesting correlations present within the galaxy spectra and eigenspectra .",
    "each galaxy spectrum can be constructed through a linear combination of the eigenspectra .",
    "while the relative weights of these combinations ( i.e. , the expansion coefficients ) have been shown to provide a basis for the classification of the galaxy spectra , the details of the individual eigenspectra provide insight into the relative correlations between the emission and absorption lines within a spectrum together with its continuum shape .",
    "spectral lines that are typically anti - correlated will appear anti - correlated in the the second eigenspectrum ( e.g. , one with positive emission and the other as an absorption feature ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pclines ] plots the first three eigenspectra ( with the first eigenspectrum the lower spectrum on the plot ) with the typical emission and absorption lines identified by the sdss spectroscopic pipelines @xcite overlaid .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd eigenspectra are flipped and offset by an arbitrary amount to improve the clarity of this figure .",
    "what is immediately apparent from this figure is that the majority of the nebula lines are highly correlated .",
    "an increase in the star formation rate within a galaxy will result in a general increase in the luminosity of all emission lines .",
    "while we expect this correlation in the hydrogen lines , it does not necessarily have to be the case for other lines such as [ ] : the physical processes that give rise to these lines are different ( i.e. , radiative vs collisional excitation ) .",
    "the most obvious anti - correlation arises for the na  d line at 5800   .",
    "the first eigen - component shows the sodium absorption ( commonly associated with neutral gas at a temperature of a few thousand degrees ) to be present in the mean spectrum of galaxies . from the second eigenspectrum",
    ", we see that as the star formation rate of the galaxy increases ( i.e. , we add the second component to the mean spectrum increasing the emission line strengths ) the intensity of the na  d absorption line decreases .",
    "if the majority of the na line comes from stellar lines ( averaged over the 157,000 galaxies in this sample ) then this relation is to be expected due to the increase in the population of o stars with increasing star formation rate .",
    "a similar relation is seen for the mg triplet .",
    "considering the eigen - components individually we see that the mean galaxy spectrum for the main galaxy sample has a significant component in the h@xmath104 and [ ] emission lines with weaker emission from [ ] and no real evidence for balmer emission below h@xmath108 . adding in the second eigenspectrum has the result of increasing the overall star formation within a galaxy ( i.e. , both the blue continuum increases together with the nebular emission lines ) .",
    "the second eigenspectrum has very strong balmer absorption indicative of post starburst activity within a galaxy .",
    "the third component is dominated by line emission .",
    "there is very little of the stellar absorption of the balmer emission lines as it is seen in the second eigenspectrum . a combination ,",
    "therefore , of the first and third component will enable the reconstruction of pure absorption or emission line spectra . within the third component the ca  k and ca  h absorption lines are strongly anti - correlated with the emission lines .",
    "increasing the contribution of the third eigenspectrum has the net effect of increasing the line emission together with decreasing the strong absorption line features .",
    "this result is understood by the fact that absorption features in a galaxy are mainly due to older stellar populations , and many emission lines , especially nebular lines , are due to the ionization of the interstellar medium within the galaxy by hot stars .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that the correlations present within the eigenspectra provide a reasonable description of the physical processes that occur within typical galaxy spectra",
    ". a more detailed description of these correlations will be the subject of a followup paper .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature within these spectra is that the second eigenspectrum shows the hydrogen emission lines in h@xmath136 , h@xmath137 , h@xmath138 , and h@xmath108 exhibiting stellar absorption .",
    "the clarity of this effect comes from the high resolution of the sdss spectroscopic data ( relative to other large spectroscopic samples such as the 2df ) together with the accurate control we have on the spectrophotometric calibration of the individual spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigspec_selfabs_all ] shows an enlarged region of interest for the first four eigenspectra .",
    "comparatively , h@xmath108 is the weakest in terms of this effect , while h@xmath104 shows no apparent effect .",
    "the absorption features are also observed in higher - order modes , but they are not shown here since the first few modes dominate .",
    "we find that the majority of the signal for the stellar absorption comes from the second eigen - component .",
    "there is a smaller contribution from the fourth component but the contribution from this component describes the variation in the widths of the hydrogen lines rather than their amplitudes .",
    "as we have shown in figure  [ fig:3modes ] using just three modes we can recover galaxy spectra with and without strong stellar absorption .",
    "the consequences of this are two - fold .",
    "the fourth eigen - component appears not to contribute significantly to the stellar absorption signal , as noted above .",
    "secondly , the fact that just two modes can recover the shape of the stellar absorption suggests that the mechanism that describes the magnitude of this process is , on average , relatively simple ( as would be expected given the correlation between the spectral properties and stellar composition of the galaxies ) . this would imply that modeling the stellar absorption and correcting for its effect on the emission line properties of galaxies should be a straightforward process in a statistical sense , even in the presence of low signal - to - noise data .",
    "the sdss uses a fixed aperture of 3 diameter for its spectroscopic observations",
    ". this can , in principal , lead to biases in the current spectral classification scheme if , for example , a fiber samples only the central bulge of a nearby intermediate or late - type galaxy ( resulting in the assignment of an early - type spectral class ) . as this effect depends on the apparent size of a galaxy when compared to the fiber diameter it has the potential to induce redshift and luminosity dependent biases in any analysis using the kl classifications @xcite .",

    "we assume that the apparent diameter of each galaxy can be approximated as twice the petrosian half - light radius ( petro50 ) in the r - band .",

    "this effect is , however , smaller than the typical dispersion between repeat observations and is negligible at signal - to - noise levels at which the sdss spectra are defined as being of survey quality .",
    "we find that there exists a minimum number of randomly selected spectra that are necessary to statistically represent the information within the full sample ( i.e. , to be representative of the true distribution of galaxies ) .",
    "for a set of ten eigenspectra ( i.e. , ten eigenspectra enable the reproduction of both quiescent and active galaxies ) the number of spectra required is around @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "this is due to the need to sample a minimum number of randomly selected galaxies in order to include galaxies with extreme emission line properties in our data set ( as they comprise only 0.1% of the full galaxy sample ) .",
    "we find that the bias on the spectral classification due to the fixed aperture spectroscopy is , on average , small and is negligible for all galaxies except for the reddest galaxies that are very close by ( @xmath162 ) and for those galaxies that are large physically ( @xmath163 kpc ) with prominent emission lines .",
    "a look - up table is constructed for the correction of this bias .",
    "there are several future directions related to this work . with the present continuous classification scheme , which simplifies the distribution of galaxies into a handful of parameters , studies of the statistics of the physical properties of galaxies",
    "become more tractable .",
    "the clustering and spectral properties of these classifications will be addressed in a future paper .",

    "<S> we perform an objective classification of 170,000 galaxy spectra in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) using the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform . with about one - sixth of the total set of galaxy spectra which will be obtained by the survey , we are able to carry out the most extensive analysis of its kind to date . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism proposed by connolly and szalay  ( 1999a ) is adopted to correct for gappy regions in the spectra , and to derive eigenspectra and eigencoefficients . from this analysis , we show that this gap - correction formalism leads to a converging set of eigenspectra and kl - repaired spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , kl eigenspectra of galaxies are found to be convergent not only as a function of iteration , but also as a function of the number of randomly selected galaxy spectra used in the analysis . from these data </S>",
    "<S> a set of ten eigenspectra of galaxy spectra are constructed , with rest - wavelength coverage @xmath0   . the eigencoefficients describing these galaxies naturally place the spectra into several classes defined by the plane formed by the first three eigencoefficients of each spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> spectral types , corresponding to different hubble - types and galaxies with extreme emission lines , are identified for the 170,000 spectra and are shown to be complementary to existing spectral classifications . from a non - parametric classification technique , we find that the population of galaxies can be divided into three classes which correspond to early late- through to intermediate late - types galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is believed to be related to the color separation of sdss galaxies discussed in earlier works . </S>",
    "<S> bias in the spectral classifications due to the aperture spectroscopy in the sdss is small and within the signal - to - noise limit for majority of galaxies except for the reddest nearby galaxies and large galaxies ( @xmath1 kpc ) with prominent emissions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean spectra and eigenspectra derived from this work can be downloaded from http://www.sdss.org . </S>"
