    "the user receives codified signals from four satellites at the same time . after decoding",

    "thus , the emission coordinates are obtained from the inertial ones .",

    "( [ inemis ] ) is not necessary since there is an analytical formula obtained by @xcite , which gives @xmath19 in terms of @xmath18 for photons moving in minkowski space - time , and arbitrary satellite world lines .",
    "we use a manageable approach which leads to an accurate enough positioning . in this approach ,",
    "the satellite world lines are appropriate timelike geodesics of the schwarzschild space - time , and the photons follow null geodesics in the minkowski space - time asymptotic to the schwarzschild geometry .    in our approach , there are two types of positioning errors .",
    "the first one is due to the fact that photons do not move in minkowski space - time , but in the earth gravitational field . in the simplest generalization of the above approach",
    ", it may be assumed that both satellites and photons move in the schwarzschild space - time created by an ideal spherically symmetric earth .",

    "metrics including earth rotation and deviations with respect to the spherical symmetry in the earth mass distribution might be also considered ; nevertheless , since the distance travelled by the photons from the satellites to any possible user is not large , and the earth gravitational field is weak , the lensing effect produced by this field on the photons is expected to be small and , consequently , positioning errors of the first type should be small . a detailed study about these errors will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this paper is devoted to study a second type of positioning errors , which are due to uncertainties in the satellite world lines .",
    "these errors are greater than those due to our assumption that photons move in minkowski space - time ( first type ) .",
    "the equations of the satellite world lines are involved in eqs .",

    "hereafter , we say that these satellites form the ideal constellation .",
    "of course , these ideal world lines are not followed by the true satellites .",
    "even if they are launched to follow them , gravity , radiation pressure , and so on , would produce deviations with respect to the ideal lines .",
    "sometimes these deviations are too large and the satellite world lines must be corrected . in this way",

    "the galileo constellation is composed by 27 satellites ( @xmath30 ) , located in three equally spaced orbital planes ( 9 uniformly distributed satellites in each plane ) .",

    "<S> global navigation satellite systems use appropriate satellite constellations to get the coordinates of an user close to earth in an almost inertial reference system . </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated both gps and galileo constellations . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the satellite world lines lead to dominant positioning errors . in this paper , a detailed analysis of these errors is developed inside a great region surrounding earth . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is performed in the framework of the so - called relativistic positioning systems . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on the jacobian ( @xmath0 ) of the transformation giving the emission coordinates in terms of the inertial ones . around points of vanishing @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> positioning errors are too large . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for any 4-tuple of satellites , the points with @xmath1 are located at distances , d , from the earth centre greater than about @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the satellite orbits which are assumed to be circumferences . </S>",
    "<S> our results strongly suggest that , for d - distances greater than @xmath2 and smaller than @xmath4 , a rather good positioning may be achieved by using appropriate satellite 4-tuples without @xmath5 points located in the user vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> the way to find these 4-tuples is discussed for arbitrary users with @xmath6 and , then , preliminary considerations about satellite navigation at @xmath6 are presented . future work on the subject of space navigation based on appropriate simulations is in progress . </S>"
