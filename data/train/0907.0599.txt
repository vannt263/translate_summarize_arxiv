    "lately , titania ( tio@xmath0 ) has received an increased attention since it is considered to be promising for cost - effective photovoltaic applications . however , high reactivity of tio@xmath0 under only uv light bears a great disadvantage which reduces the quantum efficiency so that pure tio@xmath0 is not alone sufficient for a practical system application .",

    "we employed a conjugate - gradients algorithm to compute the electronic ground state based on the minimization of the total energy subject to a convergence tolerance of 0.1 mev .",

    "integrations have been carried out over 32 and 5 special @xmath2-points sampled in the irreducible wedge for 1@xmath11 and 2@xmath12 surfaces , respectively .",
    "we did not impose any symmetry in our surface calculations .    in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",

    "a negative @xmath13 value indicates a more stable structure relative to the clean tio@xmath0 surface .",
    "positive values , on the other hand , give the relative formation energy that is required to assemble the corresponding composition .",
    "gfe , in general , is defined by , @xmath14 .",
    "one can omit @xmath15 term in comparison to the surface energy for the pressures , @xmath4 , under consideration as well as the @xmath16 term since the contribution from the entropy , @xmath17 , is negligible .",
    "therefore , it can be approximately expressed only by the internal energy @xmath18 .",
    "if one also neglects the ionic vibrational contributions , @xmath18 will be equal to the total energy @xmath19 obtained by the dft slab calculations .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium is established when the chemical potential of a given atomic species becomes equal in all phases that come into contact with each other . in particular , we assume that the surface structures are in equilibrium with the anatase tio@xmath0 bulk so that @xmath20 .",

    "the role of such an incorporation on the electronic properties of anatase surface has been investigated by examining adsorptional , substitutional , and interstitial impurities at quarter and full coverages . for these concentrations , we considered gold ions in the subsurface at the interstitial cavities up to a depth of the fifth atomic plane , and also substituted them for ti ions up to the third ti plane .    the topological structure and",

    "furthermore , bulk termination gives rise to undercoordinated ions by breaking the axial bonds over the surface . as a result , o1 and",

[ cols=\">,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the non - ionic nature of ti  o bonding in tio@xmath0 stoichiometry , due to below - nominal charge states of ti cations and o anions , has been previously shown  @xcite .",
    "bulk ions accumulate @xmath27 and @xmath28 bader charges while these values are slightly lower for the corresponding surface layer species , being @xmath29 and @xmath30 , due to bulk termination .",
    "bader charge results presented in table  [ table2 ] for the impurity neighboring ions demonstrate the local disturbance of the electronic density .",
    "the fluctuation in the charge density around the cation sites remains minimal upon au incorporation . for interstitial and adsorptional cases",
    ", gold seems to weakly bound to the lattice because of a limited charge transfer from au to nearby oxygens .",
    "we obtained relatively smaller deviations in the charge states of deeper lying atoms implying a weaker contribution to surface electronic properties .",
    "when gold is substituted for ti cations it induces deviation in the electronic density also around the second nearest neighbor oxygens owing to its spatially wider spread wavefunction .",
    "for instance , au ",
    "ti1 substitution in s11@xmath11 charges the third layer oxygen to @xmath31 that is smaller than its reference value of @xmath32 at the clean surface .    in comparison with their reference values at the clean surface , a lower amount of charge accumulation at the anions around the impurity site has been obtained for all au ",
    "tio@xmath0(001 ) structures in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "this elicits a weak polarization in the covalency between gold and oxygen at this surface .",
    "the au  o and ti  o interaction strengths can be compared based on the charge transfers in between . the electron depletion from ti",
    "to o is clearly much larger than that from au to o suggesting that ti ",
    "o bond is stronger .      the weakness of au  o bond polarization , in and on tio@xmath0 surface , compared to that of ti  o opens the possibility of an important interaction between two adjacent au atoms .",
    "clearly , au driven impurity bands disperse relatively stronger when they are incorporated to 1@xmath11 surface unit cell in fig  [ fig1 ] . therefore , we considered all possible adsorption configurations of au dimer on 2@xmath12 surface in order to investigate the effect of au ",
    "au interaction on the electronic structure of the combined system .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the minimum energy au dimer structure on the anatase tio@xmath0(001)-2@xmath12 surface .",
    "this is obtained from an initial configuration in which one au atom is placed over the ti1o1 bond in bridge position and the other one is located over the next ti1o1 bond on the back ti  o  ti row .",
    "they are attracted to each other due to au - au interaction . relatively speaking with respect to the structure shown in left - top of fig  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "as they come closer reducing the dimer length to 2.55  the one at the back row ( au2 ) pulls the nearest neighbor o1 off its lattice position up by 0.91  .",
    "however , the o1 in interaction with the au1 at the first row is elevated by only 0.06  . surprisingly , any geometry that the surface oxygens bonded symmetrically to the dimer is energetically unfavorable .",
    "we also examined the possibility of a dissociative adsorption for various configurations which corresponds to 0.5 ml coverage on this surface .",
    "our results suggest that such a dimer dissociation on the anatase surface is energetically not preferable signifying the strength of au ",
    "au attraction compared to au  o and au  ti interactions .",
    "electronically , gold dimer adsorption at 2@xmath12 unit cell drives the anatase ( 001 ) surface into a semiconducting state such that it reduces the band gap by 1.04 ev relative to anatase bulk vbm .",
    "the impurity band just below the fermi energy has a minimum at @xmath33 and a maximum at j@xmath34 which gives rise to an indirect gap .",
    "this otherwise almost flat going state lies higher in energy from a group of five surface - like bands with a separation of 0.34 ev at @xmath33 .",
    "it is mainly characterized by au ",
    "au and au1o1 interactions with a partial mixing from the unsaturated surface oxygens .",
    "the second defect states disperses conjugately to the first one having a maximum at @xmath33 and a minimum at j@xmath34 .",
    "the surface oxygen that is bonded to au2 mainly contributes to the second and the third defect states .",
    "the next impurity band that has a minimum at j and a maximum at j@xmath34 originates from au2-o1 bonding .",
    "the ldos of unsaturated o1 ions extend over the vb , also giving partial contribution to all of the defect states .",
    "we analyzed the thermodynamic stability of gold incorporated tio@xmath0 systems , considered in this work , assuming au and ti exchange between the substrate and the surrounding gas phase to account for the formation of substitutional cases .",
    "we assume experimental conditions so that au is chosen to be in equilibrium with its metallic bulk phase and redefine the zero point of energy at the maximal value of @xmath21 by introducing @xmath35 .",
    "the relative surface gfes , @xmath13 , ( or the formation energies ) are plotted as a function of @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] over its allowed range of values for 12 surface structures considered in this study .",
    "the lower limit for ti chemical potential has been obtained to be @xmath37 ev due to the fact that the surface must keep in thermal equilibrium with the bulk anatase tio@xmath0 phase .",
    "our prescription of stability of the phases can predict the structural reconstructions rather than thermally stimulated formations due to the approximation made by omitting the entropy terms in the surface gfe .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig4 ] suggest that au incorporation at 1@xmath11 surface is not favorable .",
    "for instance , au substitution for the second layer ti at 1@xmath11 anatase ( 001 ) surface ( s21@xmath11 ) is energetically the least preferable phase among the structures considered .",
    "similarly , s11@xmath11 case is also thermodynamically unstable .",
    "their formation energies further increase linearly toward ti ",
    "rich experimental conditions .",
    "au adsorption for 1 ml coverage would require an energy of 1.23 ev/1@xmath11 relative to that of the clean surface .",
    "au interstitials in the 2@xmath12 surface appears to be unfavorable compared to bulk terminated bare anatase tio@xmath0(001 ) by the formation energies of 0.44 , 0.35 and 0.35 ev/1@xmath11 for c , d , and e cases , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , au implantation into the interstitial cavities deeper than the fourth atomic layer is slightly more preferable at this surface .",
    "these calculated formation energies for au interstitials in anatase surface are in good agreement with the experimental results of perkas  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in an attempt to explain au induced crystallization ( ic ) of anatase through gold insertion into tio@xmath0 which requires thermal treatment at about 80@xmath38c by sonication",
    ", they stated that au diffuses into the support layers and forms and intermixed layer through a multiphase diffusion across the gold support interface .",
    "substitutional gold impurities tend to be linearly more unstable toward ti - rich conditions .",
    "it is also reasonable to see that au substitution for a second ti layer cation is energetically more unstable than that for the surface layer ti over the full range of allowed @xmath21 values . on the other hand , au(ti )",
    "substitution has been expected to be more preferable in a ti - poor environment .",
    "indeed , both of the substitutional cases become more stable than the clean relaxed surface under o - rich conditions when the substrate establishes thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding oxygen gas phase .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that such a surface structure can be realized under the limits , @xmath39 ev and @xmath40 ev for s2 and s1 cases , respectively .",
    "furthermore , au(ti ) substitution for the surface ti atom proves to be the most stable phase for @xmath41 ev that corresponds to a ti - poor environment .",
    "1ml gold adsorption is not preferable with a formation energy of 1.23 ev relative to that of the clean surface . on the other hand , au adsorbates at 2@xmath12 unit cell as well as the dimer structure in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] happen to be even more stable than the formation of bulk terminated bare ( 001 ) surface which is known to be under tensile stress  @xcite whereby au bonding causes a lowering of the surface energy by releasing the surface strain  @xcite we calculated the corresponding relative surface gfes as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ev/1@xmath11 for a2@xmath12 , b2@xmath12 and aa2@xmath12 structures , respectively .",
    "therefore , highly symmetrical structure in fig .  [ fig2](b ) appears to be the most stable phase over a wide range of experimental situations within @xmath45 from ti - low to ti - rich equilibrium conditions .",
    "however , the differences between the computed gfe values of these three adsorption modes are , surprisingly , not significantly large and can be accepted within the limits of a computational accuracy . in this sense , one can not conclude that a2@xmath12 and aa2@xmath12 are considerably less stable than b2@xmath12 is .",
    "the results rather suggest that these three phases might co - exist in an experimental situation where , interestingly , single au atom adsorption is metallic while dimer structure is semiconducting . therefore",
    ", overall behavior is expected to be conducting in nature .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the role of au mediated lattice relaxations as well as the effect of the impurity itself on the electronic structure of anatase tio@xmath0(001 ) for 1@xmath11 and 2@xmath12 surface unit cells .",
    "we , additionally , considered gold dimer adsorption on tio@xmath0(001)-2@xmath12 to account for the strength of au ",
    "au interaction over au  o attraction .    in comparison with ti , due to its spatially wider spread wavefunction ,",
    "gold maintains a relatively larger distance to the oxygens with which it interacts .",
    "in addition , au exhibits an ample coordination with the neighboring oxygens and , therefore , disturbs local lattice structure .",
    "electronically , an au adsorbate transfers a limited amount of charge to the nearest neighbor oxygens that reduces the ionicity leading to a relatively weaker impurity  oxygen interaction . on the other hand , au can attain higher valence charge states in the case of interstitial and substitutional incorporations due to increased coordination number with the neighboring oxygens . for 1ml impurity concentration ,",
    "gold interstitial enforced local distortion causes significant reconstruction in the form of interlayer segregation due to shortened au  au interaction distance .",
    "these impurity mediated disturbances derive new defect states and strongly disperse the existing surface bands .",
    "single au impurity brings a half - filled impurity state into the band gap of tio@xmath0(001 ) which pins the fermi level leading to metallization , in addition to other filled surface and impurity driven bands within the gap . in the adsorptional and interstitial cases ,",
    "this state is derived from the cb . for au interstitials as well as for b2@xmath12",
    ", fermi energy falls inside the cb",
    ". however , substitutional au makes it up close to the vb also deriving empty impurity states higher in energies toward the cb .",
    "the dispersion of the defect states depend on the impurity concentration and the au  o interaction strength .",
    "therefore , 1@xmath11 cases exhibit the strongest dispersions , and the adsorptional au incorporations at 2@xmath12 surface lead to flat - like defect states which represent the weakest au  o interactions .",
    "incorporated tio@xmath0(001 ) structures at 1@xmath11 surface unit cells are unstable . under strongly oxidizing , ti",
    " poor conditions gold tends to substitute surface ti ions at 1/4 ml coverage . on the other hand , for a wide range of experimental situations , from moderate to strongly reducing conditions",
    ", au adsorption is thermodynamically more stable at the 2@xmath12 support surface .",
    "single au adsorbates at this coverage bring out new acceptor sites as they reduce the surface leading to metallization .",
    "therefore , an additional gold adsorption prefers the dimer structure rather than being dissociative .",
    "gold dimer supported by the slab at 2@xmath12 surface is almost as stable as the single au adsorption signifying the strength and the role of au ",
