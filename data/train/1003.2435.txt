    "quantum dots have become in the last years very important in several fields , from spintronics to solar panels and even biological applications .",
    "they represent also possible candidates for qbits realization in view of quantum computation .",
    "the reason for such a success is that they are relatively easy to produce and their discrete energy levels @xcite can be engineered depending on specific needs acting over the intensity and shape of the confining potential . though a quantum dot is indeed a quasi zero - dimensional structure , in which electrons are confined along all three dimensions , several possible realizations of quantum dots exist . in this work we consider in particular quantum dots obtained as finite size quasi two ",
    "dimensional structures at semicondutor interfaces .",
    "a semiconductor heterostructure provides a very narrow ( 001 ) quantum well from which the quasi two - dimensional character raises . the lateral confinement",
    "may then be obtained applying an electrostatic potential or using etching tecniques .",
    "modern fabrication techniques allow also the control of the number of the confined electrons , which can be very low .    due to a structure inversion asymmetry of the material an electric field generates inside of the quantum well along the @xmath0 direction causing the appearance of the rashba interaction @xcite : @xmath1 \\ , ,   \\label{vrashba}\\ ] ] here @xmath2",
    "is the momentum of the @xmath3 electron , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices acting over the spin of particle @xmath6 .",
    "this spin ",
    "orbit interaction is particularly interesting due to its tunability @xcite : acting on the gate voltage it is possible to control the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "this in principle gives the possibility of modifying the system spin and the energy levels through a easy to operate electric potential .",
    "spin - orbit effects have a particular interest in confined systems , due to the possible appearance of features like non obvious spin densities and for their effects on energy levels and shell structures .",
    "several monte carlo simulations have already been done in different conditions @xcite , proving the validity and the accuracy of the method .",
    "other techniques have also been applied , such as hartree ",
    "fock , density functional  based methods @xcite like lda and lsda .",
    "also exact diagonalization @xcite was used , but mainly for very small numbers of electrons .",
    "quantum dots with rashba interaction were studied in particular in absence of coulomb potential @xcite and recently a dft calculation has been done also taking the coulomb interaction into account @xcite .",
    "what we propose here is an ab - initio monte carlo study , in which the spin - orbit interaction is taken into account by a spin - operator dependent propagator .",
    "the system studied in this paper is a circular quantum dot with different numbers of electrons trapped into a static parabolic electric potential of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system with @xmath10 electrons in presence of the rashba spin - orbit interaction can be written as @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively are the effective dielectric constant and electron mass in the semiconductor . about the confining potential strenght @xmath14 and the rashba interaction coupling constant @xmath7 different values",
    "have been used in our calculations in order to obtain a more complete view of the contributions of the two interactions to the system ground state . in the following",
    "we will make use of effective atomic units in order to simplify notation , defining @xmath15 .",
    "the lenght unit therefore is the effective bohr radius @xmath16 and the energy unit the effective hartree @xmath17 . for gaas quantum dots , we take @xmath18 and @xmath19 , yelding @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this hamiltonian , due to the spin - orbit term , does not commute with the angular momentum operator , but can be proven to commute with the @xmath0 component of the total momentum @xmath22 .",
    "diffusion monte carlo is a very accurate method used for the study of the ground state properties of many body systems .",
    "it is based on projection in imaginary time of an initial wavefunction , exploiting the fact that higher energy components of the initial wavefunction will tend to be exponentially suppressed respect to the ground state . in order to obtain imaginary time evolution of a wavefunction an imaginary time propagator is needed . though an exact form for the propagator is unknown , trotter s formula is employed in order to write the propagator as a product of exponentials of the different terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is correct only to second order in the propagation time .",
    "the problem is overcome by applying a short time propagation repeatedly in order to obtain a long enough projection .",
    "the dmc method samples the ground state wavefunction ( multiplied by a trial wavefunction when importance sampling is used ) with walkers , i.e. points in the phase space moving during propagation .",
    "the kinetic term of the hamiltonian produces a gaussian propagator , which is used in dmc as a sampling probability for walkers displacements .",
    "the propagator factor coming from the potential is instead usually seen simply as a weight for the walkers . in case",
    "the potential contains terms which only depend on space coordinates this is in principle not a problem . for momentum depending potentials anyway",
    ", this approach can not be applied .",
    "being walkers points in the coordinate space they do nt have a definite momentum , and in almost all interesting cases also the trial wavefunction is not a momentum eigenstate .",
    "the rashba potential , being due to a spin - orbit - like interaction , shows indeed dependence on the particles momenta and therefore needs to be treated in a particular way .",
    "the basic idea ( for a detailed description of the method see @xcite ) is dividing the propagator into three factors , containing respectively the kinetic energy , the spin - orbit potential and the remaining parts of the hamiltonian ( which then only depend on space coordinates ) .",
    "one can choose to apply the factor containg the rashba potential right after the gaussian free particle propagator . with this procedure",
    "the derivative terms inside of the spin - orbit interaction are turned into terms with space coordinates and spin operators dependence , having the meaning of a spin rotation .",
    "the third factor can finally be applied in the usual way , i.e. as a weight .",
    "the full propagator for the quantum dot in this case can be written as : @xmath23\\delta \\tau } \\times \\\\ \\nonumber e^{-i\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\sum_{i = i}^n(\\delta r^y_i \\sigma^x_i -\\delta r^x_i \\sigma _ i ^y)\\delta \\tau } g_0(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'},\\delta \\tau ) .",
    "\\label{greenfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 and @xmath25 we respectively indicate the set of new and old space coordinates of the n electrons , with @xmath26 the coulomb potential and with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the @xmath29 and @xmath30 components of the difference between the new and the old coordinates of the i - th electron . @xmath31 indicates the free particle propagator and @xmath32 the imaginary time step for the evolution .",
    "notice that the propagator has already been renormalized by the factor @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ground state energy , in order to let the ground state weight remain finite .",
    "though the quantum dot with parabolic confinement and rashba interaction can be described in absence of coulomb potential by a sum of single particle hamiltoninans , its analytical solution has nevertheless not been found yet .",
    "the problem one encounters when trying to diagonalize such hamiltonians over a basis of harmonic oscillators , is an infinite set of coupled equations .",
    "what has been so far proposed is an analytical very accurate approximation and a numerical diagonalization over two dimensional harmonic oscillator states @xcite . due to the fact that @xmath35=0 $ ] one expects to get better results for the ground state energy using a trial wavefunction which is a @xmath22 eigenstate since such a state would have the required symmetry . because the single particle orbitals deriving from the two methods mentioned above mix different harmonic oscillator states",
    ", it is difficult building with them a @xmath22 eigenstate . on the other hand one",
    "can easily provide @xmath22 eigenvectors with simple combinations of two dimensional harmonic oscillator orbitals but such wavefunctions will be both eigenstates of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and therefore will be eigenstates of operators which do not commute with the hamiltonian . from our monte carlo calculations we observed that the wavefunctions obtained from simple combinations of harmonic oscillators always give the lowest results for the ground state energy , therefore we adopted them obeying to the variational principle .",
    "because of the spin rotating factor contained in the imaginary time propagator just shown in the previous section , walkers will not only change their space coordinates during propagation , but also their spins .",
    "this implies that it is not possible separating spin  up and spin  down electrons in two slater determinants : only one determinant must be used containing all electrons .",
    "besides this it was necessary dealing with complex numbers because though single particle orbitals could be real , spin components in general are not .",
    "for these reasons the trial wavefunction is complex and its phase is not constant .",
    "this means that using the fixed node approximation is not possible .",
    "our choice has been the fixed phase approximation @xcite which is based on the idea of finding the lowest energy state having the same phase as the trial wavefunction .",
    "the results contained in this paper concern the ground state of the system for variable numbers of electrons .",
    "the energy was calculated for two values of the parabolic confining potential and for three values of the rashba interaction strenght in order to give an extensive and systematic study of the system .",
    "studying the system under different conditions is meant to partially account for the tunability of the two potentials .",

    "since the trial wave function employed in qmc calculations was a combination of gaussian orbitals and carried no information about the effects of the spin orbit interaction on the system , we stress that such peculiar structures are only due to the spin orbit propation given by the green s function .",
