    "<S> the dipole @xmath0 of systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in a static electric field @xmath1 is applied to one - dimensional peierls - hubbard models for organic charge - transfer ( ct ) salts . </S>",
    "<S> exact results for @xmath0 are obtained for finite systems of @xmath2= 14 and 16 sites that are almost converged to infinite chains in deformable lattices subject to a peierls transition . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic polarizability per site , @xmath3 , of rigid stacks with alternating transfer integrals @xmath4 diverges at the neutral - ionic transition for @xmath5 = 0 but remains finite for @xmath6 in dimerized chains . </S>",
    "<S> the peierls or dimerization mode couples to charge fluctuations along the stack and results in large vibrational contributions , @xmath7 , that are related to @xmath8 and that peak sharply at the peierls transition . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of @xmath0 to correlated electronic states yields the dielectric response @xmath9 of models with neutral - ionic or peierls transitions , where @xmath9 peaks @xmath10 are found with parameters used previously for variable ionicity @xmath11 and vibrational spectra of ct salts . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath9 accounts for the dielectric response of ct salts based on substituted ttfs ( tetrathiafulvalene ) and substituted cas ( chloranil ) . </S>",
    "<S> the role of lattice stiffness appears clearly in models : soft systems have a peierls instability at small @xmath11 and continuous crossover to large @xmath11 , while stiff stacks such as ttf - ca have a first - order transition with discontinuous @xmath11 that is both a neutral - ionic and peierls transition . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions are associated with tuning the electronic ground state of insulators via temperature or pressure in experiments , or via model parameters in calculations . </S>"
