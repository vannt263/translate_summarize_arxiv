    "field theories with the chern - simons ( cs ) term in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite are among the best studied models in the past two decades .",
    "this is due not only to its potential applications but also because of some subtle conceptual and technical aspects .",
    "indeed , the quantization of these theories raises interesting questions some of which have not been answered satisfactorily up to now .",
    "of particular interest is the set up of a renormalization / regularization scheme simple and reliable to provide a consistent framework for complex calculations .",
    "many proposals have appeared in the literature@xcite each of them presenting advantages as well disadvantages .",
    "for instance , pauli - villars regularization explicitly breaks parity , analytic regularization is not gauge invariant , and slavnov regularization becomes rather intricate beyond one - loop calculations .",
    "it is of course desirable that the regularization scheme preserves as much of the models symmetries as possible . in this respect",
    ", the popular dimensional regularization appears to be suited for the task .",
    "however , the topological nature of the cs term introduces extra complications .",
    "the levi - civita symbol does not admit a simple extension to complex dimensions @xmath3 and to overcome this problem some modifications have to be done@xcite .",
    "if one insists in keeping the levi - civita symbol in three dimensions , other approaches are possible .",
    "firstly , there is the so called _ consistent dimensional regularization _",
    "@xcite in which @xmath4 is treated as essentially three dimensional , but one has to introduce a maxwell or yang - mills kinetic term as a supplementary regularization . in another proposal , called _",
    "dimensional reduction _ @xcite the tensor algebra is done in three dimensions and afterwards the feynman integrals are promoted to @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "this method may introduce ambiguities in the _ finite _ parts of the amplitudes and also in the divergent parts in high order corrections .",
    "now , it is possible to renormalize divergent integrals without introducing an specific regularization .",
    "one of the most efficient and rigorous method is the bphz subtraction scheme which has been applied in a variety of situations@xcite .",
    "one class of this method , the soft bphz schemes , is specially adequate for the study of massless theories@xcite .    in a soft bphz scheme one introduces subtraction operators in the external momenta and in the masses of the theory . in order to have a better control of the infrared divergences , some of the subtractions have zero mass whereas others have mass equal to @xmath5 ( the renormalization scale ) . in @xmath6 this scheme is in many circumstances equivalent to the dimensional regularization with a minimal subtraction prescription , and leads to a mass - independent renormalization group equation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use a soft bphz scheme in an abelian cs theory coupled with scalar matter to compute two - loop renormalization group functions .",
    "since this method do not involve analytic continuation in the space - time dimension ( i.e. , we stay in the physical dimension @xmath7 ) , we evade the problems aforementioned .",
    "although we will be dealing mainly with massive particles the scheme allows , for non - exceptional momenta , a smooth zero mass limit if all super - renormalizable interactions are deleted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the model , generalize the soft bphz scheme to the cs theory with scalar matter , and show that the soft bphz scheme respects the ward identity . in section iii",
    "we compute the renormalization group functions up to two - loops .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions and comments . our results for the renormalization group functions extend the ones recently computed through the use of the _ dimensional reduction _",
    "@xcite , in the sense that the results agree whenever a comparison is possible .",
    "the mentioned agreement indicates that _ dimensional reduction _ is a consistent scheme , at least up two - loops , as far as renormalization group functions are concerned .",

    "are made finite by the application of subtraction operators @xmath25 arranged in accord with the _ forest formula_@xcite .",
    "the subtraction operator @xmath26 has degree @xmath27 in the derivatives and uses derivatives with respect to @xmath28 ( each of them having degree 2 ) if the integrand depends only on the square of this mass .",
    "all infrared finite subtractions are made at @xmath29 but in the would be infrared divergent terms ( possibly occurring in the last subtractions ) we make @xmath30 . as a rule",
    ", we make the minimum number of subtractions necessary to render finite a feynman amplitude .",
