    "a measurement of elastic scatterings of a projectile nucleus by a target nucleus provides unique information on the nuclear density distribution as well as the optical potential between them .",
    "the measurements of the angular distribution of purely elastic scattering for unstable nuclei are , however , very few so far because the separation of elastic and inelastic scatterings is in general difficult .",
    "very recently the elastic scattering of @xmath2he on @xmath1c has been measured at 38.3 mev / nucleon up to about 20@xmath3 in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame  @xcite , which covers considerably wider angles than the previous measurement at 41.6 mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the new data will give us better opportunity to study the interaction potential between @xmath2he and @xmath1c .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0he has attracted much experimental and theoretical interest as a two - neutron halo nucleus : it breaks to @xmath4he+@xmath5+@xmath5 by the small energy input of 0.975 mev .",
    "it is borromean as the three - body system of @xmath4he+@xmath5+@xmath5 . at the present stage of experimental precision",
    ", the @xmath6+@xmath5+@xmath5 model appears to be entirely satisfactory  @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated approach may be called for in some cases .",
    "for example , the breaking up of the @xmath6-cluster is necessary to deeply understand the binding mechanism of @xmath2he  @xcite .",
    "the weak binding of a halo nucleus implies that it can easily decay to its constituents .",
    "its ground state , lying close to the decay threshold , has a strong coupling to continuum states or resonances during the interaction with a target .",
    "this requires a special treatment of the coupling effect on the interaction potential for the halo projectile .",
    "a folding potential derived from an appropriate effective nuclear force , combined with a phenomenological imaginary term , has been successful for describing the elastic scattering of various systems  @xcite .",
    "a substantial reduction of the real strength of the folding potential has , however , been found necessary for weakly bound projectiles like @xmath7li and @xmath8be  @xcite .",
    "this effect is explained by coupled - channel calculations in which projectile excitations are explicitly taken into account .",
    "the excitation of a weakly bound projectile into the continuum states has an important influence on the elastic scattering , and in the optical model this has to be mocked up by a substantial reduction of the depth of the real potential term .",
    "the difference from the folding potential is called a dynamic polarization potential .    since a halo nucleus is an extreme case of a weakly bound projectile , a similar effect",
    "is expected for halo - nucleus projectiles , thus the applicability of the folding model to halo nuclei is questionable .",
    "in fact , the double - folding model using a realistic density - dependent nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , combined with the imaginary part taken in the conventional woods - saxon form , fails to reproduce the measured @xmath0he+@xmath1c elastic differential cross sections over the whole angular range  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of continuum states is performed by a continuum - discretized coupled - channel method , in which the continuum states of the projectile are approximated by a set of discrete states and each of them couples with the relative motion between the projectile and the target .",
    "for the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath2he the continuum states are three - body states , so in the continuum - discretized coupled - channel approach to the @xmath2he+@xmath1c scattering one must solve a four - body schrdinger equation , which , even if possible , will become very computer - time consuming . it is certainly impossible at present if one wants to consider the effect of , e.g. , the distortion of the @xmath6-core .    a way out to overcome this difficulty is to use the eikonal approximation for composite - particle scattering  @xcite , which is known as the glauber theory  @xcite when all the constituents of the colliding nuclei are treated on an equal footing .",
    "we will show that a full glauber calculation does not necessarily reproduce the new elastic scattering data but an effective phase calculated from a nucleon - target ( nt ) optical potential instead improves the description of the scattering .",
    "the utility of the approach has been tested even at low energies around 100 mev / nucleon  @xcite . with the use of the eikonal approximation it is straightforward to obtain the dynamic polarization potential .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the new @xmath0he+@xmath1c data can substantially be understood in the eikonal approximation without introducing any _ ad hoc _ assumptions and in addition to study the energy dependence of the optical potential of the @xmath0he+@xmath1c system .",
    "we stress the characteristic points and the strength of the present approach : firstly , a nucleon-@xmath1c optical potential is used as a basic input of our calculation .",
