    "to compute the monodromy group of a differential equation or a system of such equations is a notoriously difficult problem in the analytic theory of differential equations .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the computation of the monodromy group requires full understanding of the structure of the solution space of the system of differential equations under study , including the dimension of this space , a basis in it , the fundamental group of the complement to singularities of the system as well as analytic continuation and branching properties of the chosen basis .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the monodromy of certain families of systems of partial differential equations of hypergeometric type .",
    "it uses and extends the results in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "while the monodromy group of the classical gauss second - order hypergeometric differential equation has been computed by schwarz and the monodromy of the ordinary generalised hypergeometric equation has been described in  @xcite , the problem of finding the monodromy group of a general hypergeometric system of partial differential equations remains unsolved despite all the effort and several well - understood special cases ( see  @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the original motivation for the results presented in the paper goes back to the work  @xcite where the authors have posed the problem of describing the gelfand - kapranov - zelevinsky ( gkz ) nonconfluent hypergeometric systems ( see  @xcite ) , whose solution space contains a nonzero rational function for a suitable choice of its parameters . in terms of monodromy , this is equivalent to the existence of a one - dimensional subspace in the space of holomorphic solutions to the system under study with the trivial action of monodromy on it .    in the present paper",
    ", we solve a closely related problem of describing all holonomic bivariate hypergeometric systems in the sense of horn ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) whose solution space splits into a direct sum of one - dimensional monodromy invariant subspaces ( theorem  [ thm : zonotopeshavepolbasis ] ) .",
    "we call such a monodromy representation _ maximally reducible . _",
    "the relation between gkz and horn hypergeometric systems has been studied in detail in section  5 of  @xcite : for any gkz system there exists a canonically defined horn system and a naturally defined bijective map from a subspace in the space of its analytic solutions into the space of solutions to the gkz system .",
    "the solutions of the horn system that are not taken into account by this map are its persistent puiseux polynomial solutions in the sense of definition  [ def : persistentpolynomialsolution ] below . here and throughout the paper by a puiseux polynomial we mean a finite linear combination of monomials with ( in general ) arbitrary complex exponents . as it has been announced in theorem 5.3 of  @xcite ,",
