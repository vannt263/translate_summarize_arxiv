    "aluminium - silver alloys have been frequently selected to investigate the solid - state phase transformations involved in precipitation strengthening@xcite .",
    "the system is not of commercial interest , owing to the high cost ( and density ) of silver and the moderate precipitation strengthening response .",
    "however , it is an exceptionally useful system to study precipitation of intermetallic phases because the principle strengthening phase , the @xmath0 ( ) intermetallic precipitate , is formed with negligible @xmath8 volumetric strain@xcite .    the nucleation of the @xmath0 ( ) phase is considered difficult despite the coherent precipitate - matrix interface , low interfacial energy@xcite and the minimal volumetric strain@xcite associated with the phase transformation .",
    "silver - rich guinier - preston ( gp ) zones , whose formation precedes that of @xmath0 , have been observed after 200h ageing at 175@xmath9c@xcite , indicating that significant amounts of silver remained partitioned to the gp zones , rather than precipitating as the @xmath0intermetallic phase .",
    "precipitation of @xmath0precipitates generally requires the existence of suitable heterogeneous sites such as grain boundaries@xcite , dislocations @xcite or dislocation loops@xcite to assist in nucleation .",
    "the @xmath0phase is thought to form via the diffusion of silver to a pre - existing stacking fault , and the simultaneous extension of the stacking fault due to the lower stacking fault energy of silver@xcite .",
    "the al - ag - cu phase diagram contains only binary phases in the aluminium - rich region @xcite and the equilibrium phases identified are those found in the al - ag and al - cu binary systems .",
    "the @xmath0phase has also been reported in al - ag - cu alloys@xcite , along with copper - containing @xmath10(@xmath11 ) and @xmath1 ( ) intermediate phases@xcite .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath12 ( ) and @xmath13 ( ) phase were also found after high temperature ageing@xcite .    in aluminium - rich al - ag and al - ag - cu alloys",
    "the @xmath0phase formed thin , high aspect ratio plates , with @xmath14 habit .",
    "the @xmath1 ( ) phase also retains the same plate - like morphology and @xmath15 habit in both al - cu and al - ag - cu alloys@xcite .",
    "the orientation relationships determined for @xmath0and @xmath1 in al - ag - cu ternary alloys @xcite were identical to those observed in the respective binary alloys @xcite .",
    "considerable differences in the precipitation of the @xmath0phase in the ternary alloys . have been reported@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0plates in ternary alloys were found to be finer in scale and were formed in greater number densities than in binary al - ag @xcite .",
    "recent quantitative measurements found @xmath0number density were an order of magnitude greater in the ternary alloy compared to binary alloys aged under identical conditions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0precipitates also grew significantly faster than @xmath1  ( ) precipitates in al-7wt%ag-3wt%cu alloys@xcite .",
    "the microstructural changes in the ternary alloy have been attributed to competition between copper and silver for vacancies@xcite ; however , no detailed mechanism has been proposed and the role of copper is unclear .",
    "copper generates considerable misfit strains in the aluminium matrix ( unlike silver ) and is known to modify the defect structure in binary aluminium - copper alloys@xcite .",
    "these changes include changes in dislocation loop geometry and the formation of non - faulted loops @xcite .",
    "the higher number density and more refined @xmath0precipitate distribution @xcite suggest that the nucleation of the @xmath0phase may be enhanced in the ternary alloys .",
    "this is of interest given the difficulty in precipitating the @xmath0phase ; however , a detailed characterisation of the microstructure of aluminium - silver - copper alloys is lacking .",
    "such an investigation into the ternary al - ag - cu system is warranted in order to determine how microstructure differs from that of the binary alloys and how the addition of copper leads to a finer microstructure .",
    "means of increasing the precipitate number density are of interest in alloy design and offer the potential of increasing the effectiveness of precipitation strengthening@xcite .",
    "the present work sets out to determine the reasons behind the microstructural refinement of the @xmath0phase in al - ag - cu alloys .",
    "this involves an examination of the microstructure of a ternary al - ag - cu using conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem and hrtem ) .",
    "the ternary aluminium - silver - copper alloy used in this work was cast from high - purity aluminium ( cerac alloys , 99.99% purity ) , silver ( amac alloys , 99.9+% ) and copper ( amac alloys , 99.99% ) .",
    "the composition used contained 0.9at.%ag and 0.90at.%cu , hereafter designated @xmath16 .",
    "aluminium - copper and aluminium - silver alloys were also cast to provide a basis for comparison .",
    "the binary compositions were selected so that the level of alloying elements was a ) approximately equal to the combined ag and cu content of the ternary alloy or b ) approximately equal to the ag content of the ternary alloy .",
    "the pure elements were melted in air at 700@xmath9c in a graphite crucible , stirred , then poured into graphite - coated steel molds .",
    "the cast ingots were homogenised at 525@xmath9c for 7days and hot - rolled to 2 mm ( for hardness testing ) , or 0.5 mm for further thinning and tem analysis .",
    "alloy compositions were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry ( icp - aes ) .",
    "the principle impurities detected ( fe and si ) were present at less that 0.03 at.% .",
    "solution treatments were carried out for 0.5h at 525@xmath9c in a nitrate / nitrite salt pot .",
    "samples were quenched into water at ambient temperature and aged in an oil bath at 200@xmath9c for up to 72h .",
    "vickers hardness testing was carried out using loads of 2.5kg10 kg , depending on the hardness of the material .",
    "the consistency of results obtained at each load was compared , and the difference was roughly @xmath17 vickers hardness number ( vhn ) .",
    "foils for tem analysis were jet electro - polished at -20@xmath9c using a nitric acid ( 33%v / v ) / methanol(67%v / v ) solution .",
    "the voltage applied was @xmath18v , and currents averaged 200ma .",
    "conventional transmission electron microscopy investigations were carried out using a philips cm20 transmission electron microscope operating at 200kv .",
    "high resolution studies made use of a jeol  2011 hrtem instrument with a point resolution of 0.23 nm .",
    "the vickers hardness curves measured for the ternary @xmath16alloy are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] , along with those for al - ag@xcite and al - cu@xcite binary alloys .",
    "the copper containing alloys experienced a more significant increase in hardness than those with equal atomic amounts of silver .",
    "the response of the @xmath16alloy was moderate , reaching a peak hardness of @xmath19vhn after 64h of ageing .",
    "this was greater than the peak hardness for a binary al - cu alloy with equivalent cu ( @xmath20 ) but less than of @xmath21 .",
    "the latter alloy had a total solute element level close to that of the alloy of interest , meaning that on a atomic percentage basis copper was a more effective strengthening element than silver .",
    "the @xmath16alloy required more prolonged ageing to reach maximum hardness ( 64h ) than the @xmath21 , @xmath22(32h ) and @xmath20alloys ( 32h ) .",
    "the quenched - in defect structure was analysed using two - beam diffraction contrast tem .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows an electron micrograph of the al - ag - cu alloy in the as - quenched condition .",
    "elongated elliptical dislocation loops are clearly visible on the @xmath23 planes of the @xmath24-aluminium matrix .",
    "stacking fault contrast would appear as diffuse bands of alternate bright - dark contrast@xcite and was not observed for the dislocation loops in this alloy .",
    "these dislocation loops were identified as perfect dislocation loops with @xmath25 , as expected for an aluminium - copper alloy with levels of solute around 0.90at.% @xcite .",
    "an overview of the microstructure for an ageing time of 0.16h at 200@xmath9c is presented in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the microstructure contains what will be shown to be aggregated @xmath0precipitates ( at points labelled @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "some of these aggregates ( e.g. @xmath26 ) are comprised of two variants of the @xmath0precipitate , with both variants normal to the beam direction .",
    "this yields a two - dimensional assembly structure resembling a faceted ellipse , with the assembly lying normal to the @xmath28_{\\alpha}}$ ] and elongated parallel to a @xmath29_{\\alpha}}$ ] direction ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) precipitate assemblies ( @xmath27 ) appeared with the loop normal perpendicular to the viewing direction . in this orientation",
    "the @xmath0precipitates are inclined to the beam and in poor contrast .",
    "dislocation loops ( labelled @xmath30 ) are also present and have inside contrast in this figure .    the structure of the elliptical precipitate assemblies is shown in greater detail in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the micrographs were obtained from a foil aged for 0.083h at 200@xmath9c .",
    "the precipitates plates are present as aggregates with alternating @xmath31 variants formed adjacent to one another , as shown in figure  [ fig4a ] which shows a portion of a precipitate assembly .",
    "( the remainder of this assembly was removed due to foil truncation . )",
    "individual assemblies varied considerably in terms of the number of @xmath0precipitates present , their projected diameters and the size and shape of the ellipse .",
    "precipitation of @xmath0rarely occurred in the portion of the ellipse parallel to the traces of @xmath32 planes ( see figure  [ fig4a ] ) , leaving the assemblies as open , crown - like , two - dimensional structures .",
    "a diffuse feature is visible ( arrowed ) , but the weaker , less defined contrast suggests that this is associated with strain or a dislocation rather than a precipitate .",
    "figure  [ fig4b ] shows an image obtained along the @xmath28_{\\alpha}}$ ] zone axis in which the assembly was viewed edge - on . while the individual @xmath0precipitates possessed the standard @xmath31 habit for the phase , the assembly as a whole was parallel to the @xmath33 plane . in this orientation",
    "the precipitates were seen in a line with the loop only partially occupied .",
    "precipitate lengthening appeared most extensive along the habit plane of the assembly .",
    "longer ageing times resulted in precipitates with greater diameter , and in more frequent impingement between adjacent precipitates , the @xmath0precipitates formed a continuous circuit after 0.5h of ageing except at the portions tangential to the @xmath34 traces , which were devoid of @xmath0precipitates .",
    "the diffuse contrast feature noted in figure  [ fig4a ] was frequently observed in this region .",
    "high - resolution tem was used to examine the structure of the precipitate assemblies after 0.016 - 0.5h ageing .",
    "the precipitates were extremely fine in scale , with diameters as low as @xmath35 nm and frequently , thicknesses of 0.92 nm , equivalent to two unit cell heights of the @xmath0phase .",
    "figure  [ fig5a ] shows one example of the distal edge of a precipitate assembly .",
    "the diffuse contrast feature ( see open arrow ) noted in figure  [ fig4a ] ( above ) is clearly visible .",
    "the edge of another precipitate assembly is shown in figure  [ fig5b ] .",
    "the bottom of the field corresponds to the matrix , while the upper region was inside the assembly of @xmath0plates .",
    "note that the @xmath0precipitate to the far right of the field is growing towards the interior of the assembly at an angle of 70@xmath9 to the adjacent precipitate , rather than 110@xmath9 that was observed at all other points around the assembly .",
    "the copper - rich @xmath1 ( ) phase was first observed after 2h of ageing at 200@xmath9c .",
    "this phase formed as thicker plates occupying the @xmath34 faces of the faceted elliptical precipitate assemblies ( see figure  [ fig6a ] ) .",
    "most precipitate assemblies were observed with @xmath1plates on either one or both sides of the precipitate assembly , and in the latter case effectively formed a closed , two - dimensional structure , as shown in figure  [ fig6a ] .    further ageing results in the loss of the elliptical assembly structures and the continued growth of the @xmath1phase .",
    "a typical example of the microstructure in this stage is shown in figure  [ fig6b ] , where the alloy has been aged for 8hours .",
    "the @xmath0precipitates were less prominent at this stage and the assembly structures have decomposed .",
    "the @xmath0plates are most commonly observed in contact with @xmath1precipitates , towards either end of the remnants of the assembly structures .",
    "guinier  -preston zones can be seen in figures  [ fig6a ] and  [ fig6b ] , although the region close to the precipitate assembly in figure  [ fig6a ] is noticeably deficient in such zones .",
    "the microstructure of the al - ag - cu alloy contained both @xmath0 ( ) and @xmath1 ( ) precipitates , in addition to spheroidal ag - rich guinier - preston zones .",
    "the @xmath0phase formed at an earlier stage of ageing than the @xmath1phase and adopted a very distinctive morphology where two variants of the phase alternated around an approximately elliptical aggregate .",
    "this was later capped at the sections tangential to the @xmath32 ends by the @xmath1precipitates .",
    "it appeared that the @xmath0precipitates grew more extensively in the plane of the loop , as is the case in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the faceted elliptical assemblies have not been reported previously in the aluminium - silver - copper alloy system .",
    "the development of these precipitate assemblies is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "precipitates formed furthest from the centre of the assembly ( close to the @xmath34 normals ) , were typically of greater diameter and appear to have formed first ( figure  [ fig7a ] ) .",
    "these were followed by alternating @xmath37 variants of the @xmath0phase ( b ) and eventually @xmath1precipitates at the @xmath34 ends of the assemblies ( c ) .",
    "the assemblies later deteriorated due to coarsening of the precipitates , with the loss of the majority of the @xmath0plates and the growth of the surviving @xmath0plates and the @xmath1precipitates ( d ) .",
    "the presence of such assembly structures can be explained through an examination of the interaction of the dislocations loops present in the as - quenched condition with the precipitate .",
    "the dislocation loops were identified as the principle precipitation site of the @xmath0phase .",
    "the precipitate assemblies are of similar scale to the dislocation loops ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) and have the same @xmath38 habit . both dislocation loops and precipitate assemblies were absent from the grain boundaries , which are expected to act as vacancy sinks and thus prevent the formation of vacancy loops .      the dislocation loops in this alloy differed from those of binary aluminium - silver alloys@xcite .",
    "dislocation loops in the @xmath16alloy took the form of ellipses lying on the @xmath38 planes of the aluminium matrix .",
    "these did not display the alternate light - dark contrast which would indicate the presence of a stacking fault .",
    "dislocation loops in binary al - ag alloys had @xmath14 habit , were hexagonal in shape@xcite and displayed stacking fault contrast .",
    "the difference in the character of the dislocation loops was ascribed to the differing effects of solute silver and copper on the matrix .",
    "hexagonal frank dislocation loops have been observed in al - ag alloy for compositions up to 20wt.%ag@xcite .",
    "in contrast , levels of copper as low as 0.2wt% have been shown to alter the quenched in defect structure@xcite .",
    "the addition of copper to the aluminium - silver binary alloy is expected to affect both the misfit strain energy and stacking fault energy .",
    "copper generates considerable misfit strains in the aluminium matrix , due to the lower effective atomic size @xcite .",
    "tem studies of dislocation loops in aluminium - copper alloys found that dislocation loops did not exhibit stacking fault contrast@xcite .",
    "the calculations of schulthess _ _",
    "et al__@xcite predict that the introduction of copper will increase the stacking fault energy of the aluminium matrix .",
    "both factors will make the hexagonal frank dislocations unstable and subject to further changes , commencing with the nucleation of a shockley partial dislocation in the plane of the loop to remove the stacking fault@xcite .",
    "progressively greater additions of copper to aluminium alloys resulted in the formation of circular ( undissociated ) frank loops , followed by ( rounded ) rhomboidal perfect loops on @xmath39 planes and finally circular perfect dislocation loops , also on the @xmath38 planes@xcite .",
    "the elliptical dislocation loops observed in the present work correspond to the `` rounded '' rhomboidal dislocation loops reported by@xcite , as both appear to be perfect dislocation loops , elongated in the @xmath40 directions and lying on the @xmath41 planes of the matrix .",
    "the net effect of the copper will therefore be to yield a different dislocation loop type , in which the dissociated frank loops are replaced by elliptical perfect dislocation loops lying on @xmath41 planes .    the change in dislocation loop character is a complex process involving a number of steps , including the removal of the stacking fault via nucleation of a shockley partial@xcite , glide of individual segments of the dislocation@xcite and the loss of two segments of the loop@xcite .",
    "the stages preceding the formation of the elliptical dislocation loops have been reviewed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "previous reports note that the @xmath0phase can form as narrow rods on perfect dislocation helices@xcite .",
    "although the precipitate morphology is distinctly different from the assemblies described here , there are similarities since both nucleation sites possess burgers vectors of @xmath42 type . for a dislocation helix , segregation of silver to",
    "the dislocation line resulted in the dissociation of segments of the @xmath42dislocation on @xmath31 planes to form two shockley partial dislocations with burgers vectors of type @xmath43 ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the hexagonal close - packed region between the two partial dislocations was able to act as a preferred site for the formation of the @xmath0phase .",
    "the width @xmath44 of the precipitate parallel ( in the @xmath28_{\\alpha}}$ ] direction in the figure ) was controlled by the separation of the shockley partial dislocations , which was determined by the stacking fault energy@xcite .",
    "lengthening @xmath45 in the @xmath46_{\\alpha}}$ ] direction required the dislocation line to straighten into the habit plane , and thickening ( c ) required the nucleation of additional ledges on the face of the precipitate .",
    "precipitates formed on dislocation helices were restricted in length to the pitch of the helix@xcite .",
    "this was ascribed to the interaction between the dislocation helix and the precipitate .",
    "the growth of the precipitate required the bowing of the dislocation segment into the operative @xmath47-type plane in order to allow dissociation to take place .",
    "this , in turn , required local adjustments in the shape of the helix ( via dislocation glide and/or climb ) which became more difficult to achieve as the precipitate increased in scale , limiting the length of the rod - like precipitates , giving rise to the series of parallel , rod - like @xmath0precipitates along the helix .",
    "a similar process of dislocation bowing may explain the formation of faceted elliptical assemblies on perfect dislocation loops in the present work .",
    "silver segregation to the dislocation would result in the dissociation of the perfect dislocation , providing a potential nucleation site for the @xmath0phase , as for precipitation on a dislocation helix .",
    "the width of the precipitate would also be controlled by the local stacking fault energy , resulting in more extensive growth in the plane of the assembly ( as can be seen in figure  [ fig4b ] ) .",
    "lengthening of the precipitate in the plane of the loop would lead to bowing of the dislocation loop , since dissociation of the perfect dislocation into shockley partial dislocations must occur on a @xmath37 plane .",
    "the dissociation of a segment of the loop along a @xmath37 plane would act to increase the area of the loop , unless accompanied by a contrary bowing of the loop to accommodate this change .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "this figure shows @xmath0precipitates nucleating on the dislocation loop in ( a ) .",
    "these lengthen in the plane of the loop ( in ( b ) ) , forcing the dislocation loop to bow inwards .",
    "continued growth of these precipitates ( c ) would make segments of the dislocation loop parallel to the alternate @xmath31 habit plane for the @xmath0phase .",
    "this may allow for the nucleation of additional @xmath0precipitates athese sites , resulting in the faceted loop structure reported here .",
    "the presence of only two of the four @xmath31 variants of the @xmath0phase in a given precipitate assembly was also due to the burgers vector of the dislocation .",
    "a perfect dislocation of any given @xmath48 vector can only dissociate on one of two @xmath47-type planes , which are normal to the burgers vector .",
    "these correspond to the two variants formed in each assembly , with habit planes normal to that plane of the faceted ellipse .",
    "previous reports have noted qualitatively@xcite that the number density of @xmath0precipitate was greater in the binary alloy compared to the ternary , and that the precipitates diameter was lower in the ternary alloy .",
    "more recent studies have concluded that the number density of @xmath0precipitates in @xmath16was an order of magnitude greater than for an @xmath22alloy aged for equivalent time periods@xcite .    the higher number density of @xmath0precipitates in al - ag - cu alloys is a consequence of precipitation occurring on elliptical perfect dislocations , rather than hexagonal frank dislocations .",
    "while the number of precipitates which can form on a hexagonal ( dissociated ) frank loop is limited to the number of faulted surfaces initially provided by the dislocation loop@xcite , the same restriction does not apply for elliptical dislocation loops .",
    "lengthening of precipitates on a perfect dislocation loop can divert the dislocation line and result in the generation of _ additional _ faulted surfaces on which the precipitate can form .",
    "the number of precipitates per dislocation loop is significantly greater ( see for example figure  [ fig4a ] , where 12 @xmath0precipitates are visible ) .",
    "the finer scale of precipitation can also be attributed to precipitation on the elliptical dislocation loop .",
    "the lengthening behaviour of the precipitates is markedly different in this alloy . in the binary alloy ,",
    "lengthening was restricted by the nature of the dislocation bounding the stacking fault , with stair - rod @xmath49 dislocations acting as barriers to growth , while growth was permitted where the stacking fault was bounded by shockley partial dislocations@xcite .    for the faceted elliptical assemblies ,",
    "the controlling factor for growth appears to be the potential for the nucleation of alternate @xmath0variants due to the bowing of the dislocation loop .",
    "nucleation of additional precipitates , of the alternative variant possible for a given dislocation loop , would block the growth of the original plate in the plane of the defect .",
    "the higher number density was not matched by a commensurate improvement in the mechanical properties of the ternary alloy .",
    "similar hardness data has been reported in the literature@xcite , but the reasons have not been made clear .",
    "the poor strengthening response was due in part to the localisation of the precipitates into discrete , isolated assemblies .",
    "the second factor limiting precipitation strengthening in the @xmath16alloy relates to the limited growth of the precipitates .",
    "plate - shaped precipitates offer optimal strengthening when thin and of extremely high aspect ratio@xcite .",
    "growth of precipitates on elliptical , perfect dislocation loops does not allow the precipitates to adopt such a form and the precipitates could be more accurately described as lath - like .",
    "the reduction in precipitate diameter and then increase in number density of the @xmath0 ( ) phase in al - ag - cu alloys compared to binary al - ag alloys can be attributed to the heterogeneous defect assisting in the nucleation of the precipitate .",
    "nucleation on elliptical perfect dislocation loops in the ternary alloy permits the formation of a greater number of precipitates per dislocation loop , while simultaneously restricting the lengthening of the precipitates .",
    "both effects are due to the lengthening of the precipitates causing bowing of the dislocation line and permitting the formation of additional @xmath0precipitates , while simultaneously limiting the growth of those precipitates .",
    "the @xmath1precipitate was not observed until well after the faceted elliptical assemblies were well established and does not develop the extended cross- or t - shaped arrays reported in al - cu alloys @xcite .",
    "while the presence of copper is responsible for the change in quenched - in defect structure , change in microstructure is not due to the presence of the @xmath1phase _ per  se_.",
    "a detailed examination of the microstructure of the ternary al - ag - cu alloy has been conducted . the @xmath0 ( )",
    "phase was found to form as faceted elliptical assemblies on perfect dislocation loops .",
    "two variants of the @xmath0phase were identified for a given dislocation loop , each lying on a @xmath37 normal to the habit plane of the dislocation loop .",
    "the formation of this structure can be explained through the dissociation of the dislocation loop , followed by bowing of the dislocation loop to compensate for the lengthening of the precipitate , leading eventually to the formation of the alternate @xmath0variant . the @xmath1 ( ) phase",
    "was found to form on the dislocation loops following longer ageing and does not appear to be the determining factor leading to the change in microstructure .",
    "the faceted assembly structure explains a number of features previously associated with the formation of the @xmath0phase in the ternary alloy , namely the presence of a higher number density of the silver - rich precipitate , along with a more refined microstructure than in the binary al - ag alloy . in both instances",
    "the precipitation - strengthening response is limited by the aggregation of the precipitates into discrete isolated assemblies .",
    "the substantial differences in the precipitate microstructure in the binary al - ag and al - ag - cu can be ascribed to differences in the heterogeneous defect assisting in the nucleation of the precipitate .",
    "this illustrates the importance of understanding the identity and role of heterogeneous defects in precipitation - strengthened alloys in general .",
