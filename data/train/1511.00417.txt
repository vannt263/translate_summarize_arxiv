    "we now present the equations for the reaction - transport dynamics of charges in an electrolyte .",
    "to be specific , we consider here only electrolytes that contain reductant - oxidant pairs ( denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) that interact directly with the semiconductor through electrons transfer ( which we will model in the next section ) , and @xmath104 other charged species ( denoted by @xmath105 ) that do not interact directly with the semiconductor through electron transfer .",
