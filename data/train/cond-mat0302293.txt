    "transition metal oxides have been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies after the discovery of a variety of novel physical phenomena and a diversity of ordered phases.@xcite their ground state can be insulating , metallic or superconducting , depending on temperature and stoichiometry and their magnetic structure varies from ferromagnetic ( fm ) to different antiferromagnetic ( afm ) types . the insulating behavior is generally attributed to a large coulomb interaction that localizes the @xmath4-electrons in mott - hubbard or charge - transfer regimes.@xcite in this case low energy excitations can be described by the spin degrees of freedom through an effective superexchange model . often , the ground state of the transition metal ion possesses an orbital degeneracy in addition to its that originating from the spin . in such cases ,",
    "orbital degrees of freedom are also incorporated in the superexchange theory and the system is described by means of an effective spin - orbital model.@xcite    the purpose of the present work is to formulate such a superexchange theory and derive a spin - orbital hamiltonian for the antiferromagnetic insulator sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 .",
    "the experimental value of its nel temperature @xmath5 is quite low and reported in the literature as @xmath6 k.@xcite sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 belongs to a family of double perovskite compounds with general formula a@xmath0bb@xmath7o@xmath1 .",
    "it has , however , electronic and magnetic properties which differ significantly from those of the other members of the family .",
    "for example , sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 , that have been the subject of the intense studies since the discovery of room temperature magnetoresistance in these compounds,@xcite are half - metallic ferrimagnets with fairly high magnetic transition temperatures .",
    "@xcite one of the reason why sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 is so different from the other members of the group has been suggested by band structure analysis.@xcite in this picture , the antibonding w(5d ) states are pushed higher in energy by the stronger hybridization with oxygen @xmath8-orbitals.@xcite ( in the case of re(5d ) states this effect is compensated by the deeper @xmath9-level of re ion . ) because of this , 5d - electron prefer to move away from w site , leaving it in a w@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) configuration , and stay on the fe @xmath12-level even at the cost of paying an extra coulomb energy . as a result , in sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 iron",
    "is in a fe@xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) valence state,@xcite and the moderately large fe - w charge transfer gap , in the presence of strong coulomb interaction on fe sites , causes the insulating behavior .    in the perovskite structure , the octahedral ligand field of oxygens",
    "splits d - levels into a low - lying triplet ( @xmath14 ) and a higher doublet ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "there are several experimental evidences@xcite suggesting that fe@xmath3 ion is in the high spin configuration @xmath16 with @xmath2 .",
    "as four electrons occupy the threefold degenerate @xmath14-levels , the ground state of fe@xmath3 has a threefold orbital degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy , similarly to the spin one , can be described by pseudospin quantum numbers .",
    "the spin @xmath2 and pseudospin @xmath17 are thus the building blocks of an effective theory for insulating sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 . in the double perovskite structure of sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 fe and w ions",
    "form a rock - salt structure .",
    "each type of ions resides on a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) sublattice .",
    "the fcc lattice is weakly frustrated and allows ordered anisotropic afm structures .",
    "but weak frustration of the lattice alone can not be responsible for the very low magnetic transition temperature .",
    "the reason why @xmath18 is low , we believe , is as follows .",
    "the superexchange interaction , that couples magnetic moments of fe ions , is mediated by two types of diamagnetic ions , along the path fe - o - w - o - fe , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 angles between fe and w ions . because of this , the resulting fe - fe exchange is rather weak and the corresponding transition temperature is low .",
    "the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) fe moments are coupled , respectively , by @xmath19 and @xmath20 fe - w - fe bonds .",
    "depending on values and signs of the nn and nnn exchange energies , different types of afm structures can be stabilized on the fcc lattice . to our knowledge",
    "no experimental determination of the kind of afm order taking place in sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 has ever been undertaken .    in this paper",
    "we derive an effective spin - orbital model from the hubbard hamiltonian of correlated fe-3d electrons hybridized with uncorrelated 5d electrons of w and determine the magnetic ground - state structure as a function of the model parameters .",
    "we assume that oxygen degrees of freedom are integrated out and consider an effective hybridization between fe and w @xmath4-states . performing a fourth order perturbation expansion in the hopping parameters around the atomic limit",
    "we get an effective @xmath2 hamiltonian for a system with six electrons in five @xmath4 orbitals",
    ". it may be worthwhile to note that our derivation is based only on the geometrical structure and electronic configuration of the system .",
    "as such it can be applied to a variety of systems presenting the same characteristics : any rock - salt with a high - spin @xmath16 configuration , like , e.g. , feo .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the multi - band hubbard hamiltonian , perform the fourth order perturbation expansion and write the effective spin - orbital hamiltonian in which the orbital degrees of freedom are described in terms of the pseudospin representation .",
    "the derivation of the effective hamiltonian demands a lot of algebra with rather cumbersome expressions . to facilitate the reader , we have tried to use , whenever possible , a pictorial representation of states and processes , relegating both the fourth order perturbation scheme and all the final expressions in the appendices a and b , correspondingly . in section",
    "iii the classical ground state phase diagram of the effective spin - orbital model is discussed , as a function of model parameters , within a variational procedure . in the same section",
    "we also discuss the range of the external parameters appropriate to the case of sr@xmath0fewo@xmath1 and sketch some results . in section",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "here we introduce the five - band hubbard hamiltonian , and perform a perturbative expansion in the hopping parameters up to the fourth order to describe all the low - lying excited states of the fe - w system in terms of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of iron sites , only .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coulomb repulsion among electrons in the same and in different orbitals , respectively , and @xmath26 is the hund s coupling constant .",
    "due to the cubic symmetry , the relation @xmath27 holds .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators , @xmath28 and @xmath29 refer to fe-3d orbitals at site @xmath30 , of type @xmath31 ( one of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) and with spin @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the octahedral crystal field splitting of d - orbitals into a @xmath15-doublet ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and a lower - lying @xmath14 triplet ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) is taken into account for both fe and w ions by the term:@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 counts the electrons on w sites @xmath41 .",
    "the summation is for all @xmath30 and @xmath41 running over fe and w sublattices , respectively .",
    "finally , the last term of the local part of the hamiltonian , @xmath42 , represents the single particle energy level of the w ion with respect to fe@xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the charge transfer energy , i.e. , the minimum energy needed to remove one electron from fe@xmath43 ion and put it to an empty w@xmath46 site . here and below an upper index denotes the number of @xmath4-electrons on a given ion .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath47 is considered as a perturbation : @xmath48 the summation is over nearest - neighbor fe - w sites , and all possible spin and orbital indices . here",
    "@xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) creates ( annihilates ) a 5d - electron on w ions , with spin @xmath51 in the orbital @xmath31 . in a cubic lattice",
    "there is no hopping between @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath52 is diagonal in the @xmath14 manifold for all the orbitals @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with non - zero matrix elements @xmath53 only for the bonds laying in the corresponding plane ( i.e. , along @xmath54 direction , the hopping integral is zero for @xmath36 orbitals and equal to @xmath53 for the other two ) . due to the shape of the @xmath15 orbitals ,",
    "their hybridization is different in the three cubic directions thus leading to direction dependent hopping with the anisotropic transfer matrix elements @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) given by : @xmath58    in constructing the effective hamiltonian we also assume that the hund s coupling @xmath26 is strong enough to win the competition with the crystal field splitting @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that fe@xmath3-ion in the ground state is in the high - spin configuration @xmath60 with total spin @xmath2 , and justifies the exclusion from our zeroth order of the low - spin state , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and of the intermediate - spin state , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , both higher in energy .",
    "we can write the ground state as a collection of atomic states @xmath65 , each characterized by two quantum numbers : the spin @xmath66 and pseudospin @xmath67 .",
    "this latter describes the orbital occupation , namely the position of double occupied orbital in the @xmath14-manifold .",
    "since there are three possibilities to put the double occupied orbital in the manifold , we can describe it by @xmath68 , with the same algebra of the usual spin operator .",
    "the orbital quantization axis can be selected arbitrarily , and we choose the following convention which pictorially can be presented as : +               + in this notation , the upper boxes represent the @xmath15 orbital doublet , @xmath75 ( left upper box ) and @xmath76 ( right upper box ) .",
    "the lower boxes refer to the three - fold degenerate @xmath14 orbitals . with @xmath77 ( left box ) , @xmath78 ( central box ) and @xmath79 ( right box ) .",
    "the atomic ground state energy is @xmath80 . because of the three - fold orbital and the five - fold spin degeneracies , the ground state is 15-fold degenerate .",
    "such a degeneracy is then lifted by the hopping term , @xmath47 , as detailed below .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly describe the perturbation scheme and classify the excited states according to their total spin @xmath81 , their @xmath82 projection and orbital configurations .",
    "since we are interested in describing the superexchange interactions between iron sites , we need to go beyond second order perturbation theory in the hopping hamiltonian @xmath47 and deal with fourth - order perturbative expansion .",
    "in fact , we neglect the direct fe - fe hopping and consider only the hopping through the w sites .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath47 is such that the fourth order eigenvalue equation simplifies to ( see appendix a ) :      where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are two possible ground - states for @xmath22 ( all the fe@xmath3-ions in the @xmath16 configuration , all 5d w - orbitals empty ) , while @xmath86 denotes all possible intermediate excited states , as imposed by @xmath47 .",
    "the first and third step states , @xmath87 , must have five electrons on one fe - ion and one electron in an adjacent w - ion ( @xmath88 ) , while the second - step state , @xmath89 , must be of the kind @xmath90 or @xmath91 on the three sites involved in the hopping process ( see fig .  [ process ] ) .",
    "our aim is to find out a representation of the effective hamiltonian , leading to this same eigenvalue equation , in terms of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of iron only .",
    "we consider the full multiplet structure of the intermediate states with five and seven electrons which can be grouped according to their energies and the total value of the spin .",
    "moreover , depending on the orbital occupation of fe@xmath43 ion in the ground state and the orbital symmetry ( @xmath15 or @xmath14 ) of the hopping electron , different intermediate configurations can be reached .",
    "as already stated , in the cubic symmetry the hopping is allowed only within @xmath14-manifold and @xmath15-manifold , separately .",
    "consider the excited states which involve @xmath14 hopping , first .",
    "the intermediate atomic states with seven electrons fe@xmath92 have total spin @xmath93 .",
    "the manifold is 12-fold degenerate ( 4(spin)@xmath943(orbital ) ) and one of the possible states can be depicted as : +                  ( 50,30 ) ( 20,12)(20,0 ) @xmath101 ( 70,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 82.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 94.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 75.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 88.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 118,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 130,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 142.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 154.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 135.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 148.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 173,12)(5,0)@xmath103      ( 50,30 ) ( 20,12)(20,0 ) @xmath104 ( 70,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 82.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 94.1,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 75.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 88.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 118,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 130,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 142.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 154.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 135.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 148.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 173,12)(5,0)@xmath103      ( 50,30 ) ( 10,12)(20,0 ) @xmath105 ( 60,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 72.05,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 84.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 65.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 78.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 102,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 110,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 122.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 134.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 115.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 128.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 151,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 160,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 172.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 184.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 165.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 178.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 200,12)(5,0)@xmath106      ( 50,30 ) ( 18,12)(20,0 ) @xmath107 ( 70,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 82.05,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 94.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 75.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 88.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 112,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 120,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 132.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 144.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 125.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 138.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 161,12)(3,0)@xmath102 ( 170,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 182.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 194.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 175.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 188.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 211,12)(5,0)@xmath106      ( 50,30 ) ( 50,12)(5,0)@xmath108 ( 75,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 87.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 99.1,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 80.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 93.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 118,12)(3,0)@xmath109 ( 130,0)(12,12)@xmath71 ( 142.05,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 154.1,0)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 135.95,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 148.05,12.6)(12,12)@xmath70 ( 173,12)(5,0)@xmath103     + each of these states is 4-fold degenerate because of the spin ( only the states with maximum @xmath82 are shown ) .",
