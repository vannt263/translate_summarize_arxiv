    "although the standard model ( sm ) has withstood all possible experimental challenges and has been tested to an unprecedented degree of accuracy , so far there has been no direct experimental verification of the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking . with the latter",
    "being considered a central pillar of this theory and its various extensions , the search for a higgs boson is one of the main aims for many current and future colliders  @xcite . within the sm ,",
    "the only fundamental spin-@xmath4 object is the ( @xmath0-even ) higgs boson and remains the only particle in the sm spectrum to be found yet .",
    "rather , a lower bound on the mass of the sm higgs boson , ( about 114.5 gev ) is provided by the direct searches at the lep collider  @xcite .",
    "electroweak precision measurements , on the other hand , provide an upper bound on its mass of about 204 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "it should be realized that both these limits are model dependent and may be relaxed in extensions of the sm .",
    "for example , the lower limit can be relaxed in generic 2-higgs doublet models  @xcite or in models with @xmath0 violation  @xcite . in the latter case , direct searches at lep and elsewhere still allow the lightest higgs boson to be as light as 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the upper bound on the mass of the ( lightest ) higgs in some extensions may be substantially higher  @xcite . the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "is expected to be capable  @xcite of searching for the higgs boson in the entire mass range allowed .",
    "it is then quite obvious that just the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc will not be sufficient to validate the minimal sm .",
    "for one , the only neutral scalar in the sm is a @xmath5 state arising from a @xmath6 doublet with hypercharge 1 , while its various extensions can have several higgs bosons with different @xmath0 properties and @xmath7 quantum numbers .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , for example , has two @xmath0-even states and a single @xmath0-odd one  @xcite .",
    "thus , should a neutral spin-0 state be observed at the lhc , a study of its @xmath0-property would be essential to establish it as _ the _ sm higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "since , at an @xmath8 collider , the dominant production modes of a neutral higgs boson proceed via its coupling with a pair of gauge bosons ( @xmath9 ) , any change in the @xmath10 couplings from their sm values can be probed via such production processes . within the sm / mssm , the only ( renormalizable ) interaction term involving the higgs boson and a pair of gauge bosons is the one arising from the higgs kinetic term . however , once we accept the sm to be only an effective low - energy description , higher - dimensional ( and hence non - renormalizable ) terms are allowed .",
    "if we only demand lorentz invariance and gauge invariance , the most general coupling structure may be expressed as @xmath11 \\label{eq : coup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denote the momenta of the two @xmath13 s ( @xmath14 s ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the context of the sm , at the tree level ,",
    "@xmath17 while the other couplings vanish identically . at the one - loop level or in a different theory ,",
    "effective or otherwise , these may assume significantly different values .",
    "we study this most general set of anomalous couplings of the higgs boson to a pair of @xmath13s and @xmath14 at a linear collider ( lc ) in the processes @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being a light fermion .",
    "the various kinematical distributions for the process @xmath18 , proceeding via vector boson fusion and higgsstrahlung , with unpolarized beams has been studied in the context of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the effect of beam polarization has also been investigated for the sm  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous @xmath2 couplings have been studied in refs.@xcite for the lc and in refs.@xcite for the lhc in terms of higher dimensional operators .",
    "@xcite investigates the possibility to probe the anomalous @xmath20 couplings , @xmath21 , using the optimal observable technique  @xcite for both polarized and un - polarized beams .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , probes the @xmath0-violating coupling @xmath22 by means of asymmetries in kinematical distributions and beam polarization . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath10 vertex is studied in the process of @xmath23 using angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : vvh ] we discuss the possible sources and symmetries of the anomalous @xmath10 couplings and the rates of various processes involving these couplings . in section",
    "[ sec : zzh ] we construct several observables with appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath24 property to probe various @xmath2 anomalous couplings . in section  [ sec : wwh ] we construct similar observables to probe anomalous @xmath3 couplings , which we then use along with the ones constructed for the @xmath2 case .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] contains a discussion and summary of our findings .",
    "the anomalous @xmath10 couplings in eq.([eq : coup ] ) can appear from various sources such as via higher order corrections to the vertex in a renormalizable theory  @xcite or from higher dimensional operators in an effective theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the mssm , the non - zero phases of the trilinear susy breaking parameter @xmath25 and the gaugino / higgsino mass parameters can induce @xmath0-violating terms in the scalar potential at one loop level even though the tree level potential is @xmath0-conserving . as a consequence , the higgs - boson mass eigenstates can turn out to be linear combinations of @xmath0-even and -odd states .",
    "this modifies the effective coupling of the higgs boson to the known particles from what is predicted in the sm ( or even from that within a version of mssm with no @xmath0-violation accruing from the scalar sector ) .    in a generic multi - doublet model , whether supersymmetric  @xcite or otherwise  @xcite , the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to a pair of gauge bosons satisfy the sum rule @xmath26 thus , while @xmath27 for a given higgs boson can be significantly smaller than the sm value , any violation of the above sum rule would indicate either the presence of higher @xmath6 multiplets or more complicated symmetry breaking structures ( such as those within higher - dimensional theories )  @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath28 or @xmath29 can arise only at a higher order in a renormalizable theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within models such as the sm / mssm where the tree - level scalar potential is @xmath0-conserving , @xmath29 may be generated only at an order of perturbation theory higher than that in which the higgs sector acquires @xmath0-violating terms .",
    "however , in an effective theory , which satisfies @xmath30 symmetry , the couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 can arise , at the lowest order , from terms such as @xmath31 or @xmath32  @xcite where @xmath33 is the usual higgs doublet , @xmath34 is a field strength tensor and @xmath35 its dual .",
    "it can be easily ascertained that the effects of the higher dimensional terms in the trilinear vertices of interest can be absorbed into @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) by ascribing them with non - trivial momentum - dependences ( form factor behavior ) .",
    "clearly , if the cut - off scale @xmath36 of this theory is much larger than the typical energy at which a scattering experiment is to be performed , the said dependence would be weak . in all processes that we shall be considering ,",
    "this turns out to be the case .",
    "in particular , the bjorken process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn](b ) ) essentially proceeds at a fixed center - of - mass energy , hence both @xmath37 and @xmath22 are constant for this process . even for the other processes of interest , namely gauge boson fusion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn](a ) ) , the momentum dependence of the form - factors have a rather minor role to play , especially for @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that we can treat @xmath39 as phenomenological and energy - independent parameters",
    ".      a consequence of imposing an @xmath30 symmetry would be to relate the anomalous couplings , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for the @xmath3 vertex with those for the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "however , rather than attempting to calculate these couplings within a given model , we shall treat them as purely phenomenological inputs , whose effect on the kinematics of various final states in collider processes can be analyzed .    in general ,",
    "each of these couplings can be complex , reflecting possible absorptive parts of the loops , either from the sm or from some new high scale physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is easy to see that a non - vanishing value for either @xmath42 or @xmath43 destroys the hermiticity of the effective theory .",
    "such couplings can be envisaged when one goes beyond the born approximation , whence they arise from final state interactions , or , in other words , out of the absorptive part(s ) of higher order diagrams , presumably mediated by new physics .",
    "a fallout of non - hermitian transition matrices is non - zero expectation values of observables which are odd under @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for the pseudo - time reversal transformation , one which reverses particle momenta and spins but does not interchange initial and final states .",
    "of course , such non - zero expectation values will be indicative of final state interaction only when kinematic cuts are such that the phase space integration respects @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath46 too can be complex in general and can give an additional @xmath24-odd contribution .",
    "however , for the processes that we will consider , the phase of at least one of @xmath47 and @xmath48 can always be rotated away , and we make this choice for @xmath48 .",
    "henceforth , we shall assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are _ close to their sm value _",
    ", i.e. @xmath49 , the rationale being that any departure from @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively would be the easiest to measure    unfortunately , this still leaves us with many free parameters making an analysis cumbersome .",
    "one might argue that @xmath30 gauge invariance would predict @xmath52 .",
    "however , once symmetry breaking effects are considered , this does not necessarily follow  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will make this simplifying assumption that @xmath53 is real and equal to @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , since the equality is found to hold true in some specific cases  @xcite ( and would be dictated if @xmath30 were to be an exact symmetry of the effective theory ) . with this assumption , we list , in table  [ tab : coup ] , the @xmath0 and @xmath45 properties of such operators .",
    ".[tab : coup]transformation properties of various anomalous couplings under discrete transformations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that , unlike in the case of the @xmath2 couplings , we have largely been unable to construct observables that are primarily dependent only on a given anomalous coupling .",
    "in other words , the constraints are correlated .",
    "thus , it is of interest to obtain the maximal size that these couplings may assume with the aid of such correlations .",
    "such an analysis may be performed by examining the 9-dimensional parameter space ( i.e. , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings ) and delineating the part that would be consistent with _ all _ the observables to a given level of confidence .",
    "clearly , the lack of correlations for the @xmath2 couplings renders the _ blind region _ to be trivial in five of the nine dimensions and the extent of these remain the same as in table  [ tab : ind - lim ] .",
    "the most general simultaneous limits on the anomalous @xmath3 couplings obtained using this method are presented in table  [ tab : com - wwh ] for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the @xmath24-even couplings , such limits are comparable to the corresponding individual limits ( table  [ tab : lim - wwh ] ) with only a small dilution due to contamination from @xmath2 vertex . for the @xmath24-odd couplings , however , the lack of any @xmath24-odd observable results in a possibly large contamination from @xmath2 vertex .",
    "consequently , the limits on @xmath58 and @xmath59 are only `` indirect '' and hence poor .",
    "finally , the effect of a non - zero @xmath60 is seen only in @xmath61 due to the large correlation between them ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rebw - k2 ] ) .",
    "we have constructed observables which , due to their @xmath0 and @xmath62 transformation properties , receive contributions only from specific anomalous couplings with matching @xmath0 and @xmath24 properties . thus , most of the observables we construct are sensitive only to a single anomalous coupling .",
    "this one - to - one correspondence between the observable and the anomalous coupling allows us to obtain a robust constraint on the latter , _ independent _ of the values of all the other anomalous couplings .",
    "thus we see from tables  [ tab : ind - lim ]  [ tab : com - wwh ] that the individual and simultaneous limits are the same ( or very similar ) in most cases .",
    "the observables we construct are also very simple from the point of view of experimental measurements .",
    "in other words , they are both very physical and easily implementable in actual experiments .",
    "it should also be noted that the limits that we quote on the anomalous couplings , other than those on @xmath63 , are obtained using only asymmetries . in general , asymmetries are more robust with respect to the effects of radiative corrections , except in situations where the tree level contributions are accidentally small .",
    "this also means that we have a clear indication as to which observables bear a tighter scrutiny while assessing the effect of radiative corrections .",
    "available calculations of higher order corrections , in the sm  @xcite , to the processes under consideration show that the total rates receive a correction less than 3% for a higgs with mass about 120 gev , thus validating our choice of @xmath64 . since radiative corrections to the processes we consider",
    "have been computed not only in the sm  @xcite but also for the mssm  @xcite , assessing the effects of these on the rates and asymmetries and hence on the sensitivity for the anomalous couplings will be the next logical step of this analysis which has shown efficacy of these variables to probe these couplings .",
    "furthermore , in our analysis , we have imposed simple cuts on the kinematic variables which virtually eliminate the non - higgs backgrounds to the particular final states under consideration .",
    "since the latter involve @xmath65 jets , we fold our results with realistic @xmath65-tagging efficiencies . in addition , certain cuts also serve to enhance / suppress particular contributions to the signal . for example , the additional cuts @xmath66 and @xmath67 were introduced to enhance the contribution from @xmath68channel and @xmath69channel diagrams respectively .",
    "if we look at the observables pertaining to the @xmath2 vertex , then all the couplings , except for @xmath70 , are best constrained with @xmath66 cut , i.e , via the bjorken diagram when @xmath14 boson is produced on - shell .",
    "the contributions from @xmath71 and @xmath72 are proportional to @xmath73 , and hence are small away from the @xmath14-pole . for @xmath70 , however , the contribution from the @xmath74-channel is roughly proportional to @xmath75 hence an analysis with the @xmath67 cut provides a better limit .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the @xmath3 couplings .",
    "while the relevant final state , namely @xmath76 , receives large contributions from @xmath24-odd coupling , the impracticality of measuring the momentum of an individual neutrino prevents us from isolating such contributions .",
    "consequently , we are left with just two observables , which , coupled with @xmath77 and @xmath78 cuts , provide probes of the @xmath24-even couplings .",
    "the bounds on the @xmath24-odd couplings are indirect and hence suffer from reduced sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from non - zero anomalous @xmath2 couplings can not be eliminated in their entirety and are treated as contaminations in the determination of the @xmath3 couplings .",
    "together , these two factors result in the bounds on the two @xmath24-odd @xmath3 couplings to be as weak as order unity .",
    "note though that our entire formalism presupposes that the anomalous couplings are small and thus these limits on @xmath59 and @xmath58 are of little value .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of our analysis with those of earlier investigations .",
    "@xcite had analyzed the case of @xmath2 couplings with ( out ) initial beam polarization .",
    "we find that the effect of realistic cuts on kinematic variables required to isolate the signal with the dominant final state with @xmath79 as well as the finite @xmath65-tagging efficiency , reduces the possible limits on @xmath22 by about a factor of 2 , compared to the ones quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite with unpolarized beams .",
    "needless to say , if the reduction in rates implied by these cuts is neglected , our analysis does reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an optimal observable analysis  @xcite is performed , including along with an additional anomalous @xmath80 coupling . while such optimal variable analyses generally indicate the maximum achievable sensitivity , the observables constructed very often remain a little opaque with respect to the physics they probe .",
    "the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite is quite different from ours .",
    "still , making use of the correlation matrices given by them , and putting the @xmath80 coupling to zero , one may extract the limits their analysis will imply for our parameterization .",
    "doing this , we find that , for the @xmath24-even couplings , our limits compare quite well with those obtained in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , implying thereby that our simple @xmath24 observables indeed catch the physics content of their optimal observables in this case . for the @xmath24-odd couplings , our use of simple observable like the expectation value of sign of @xmath81 rather than the expectation value of the momentum correlator",
    ", @xmath82 causes a loss in sensitivity only by a factor 4 .",
    "given the fact that some of this is attributable to our use of realistic kinematic cuts , @xmath65-tagging efficiencies etc , this is a very modest price to pay for the simplicity of the observable .",
    "the optimal observable analysis shows that the use of @xmath83 and @xmath84 final states and polarization of the beams can improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "this is a very good motivation for constructing analogous simple observables similar to the ones constructed here .    to summarize",
    ", we have looked at the higgs production processes at an @xmath8 collider involving @xmath10 coupling .",
    "we constructed several observables with appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath24 properties to probe various anomalous couplings incorporating realistic cuts and detection efficiencies .    using these observables in the context of @xmath85 fusion and higgstrahlung processes , we obtain stringent but realistic bounds on the various anomalous @xmath2 couplings , even while allowing for maximal cancellations between the various individual contributions .",
    "as for the @xmath3 couplings , their effects can not be fully isolated from those of the @xmath2 couplings . nonetheless , we are able to derive quite stringent bounds for the @xmath24-even subset even while accounting for maximal contamination from the@xmath2 sector . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of suitable @xmath24-odd observables render the limits on the @xmath24-odd @xmath3 couplings to be only indirect and thus poor .",
    "we reemphasize that all our asymmetries are simple to construct , have specific @xmath0 and @xmath24 properties to probe specific anomalous coupling , and are robust against both the radiative correction to the rates as well as systematic errors .",
    "we thank b. mukhopadhyaya for collaboration in the initial phase of this project and s. d. rindani , m. schumacher and k. moenig for useful discussions and s. k. rai for reading the manuscript .",
    "we would like to acknowledge support from the department of science and technology under project number sr / fist / psi-022/200 , to the center for high energy physics , iisc , for the cluster which was used for computations .",
    "the work was also partially supported under the dst project sp / s2/k-01/2000-ii and the indo - french project ifc/3004-b/2004 .",

    "dc thanks the dst , india for financial assistance under the swarnajayanti grant .",
    "as mentioned in section iib , the total cross - section for @xmath86 receives contributions only from @xmath0-even and @xmath24-even couplings @xmath87 and @xmath88 , while the other couplings contribute to partial cross - section in such a way that their net contribution to the total rate is zero . in our analysis",
    "so far , we considered appropriately chosen partial cross - sections and combined them to construct asymmetries . in its stead , we could , in principle , have considered just the partial cross sections themselves and investigated their resolving power .",
    "this , we attempt now .    to start with",
    ", we look at @xmath89 and constrain the higgs boson to be in the forward direction ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 to be above the higgs production plane ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this partial cross - section , called `` forward - up '' and denoted by @xmath93 in section iii f , is plotted as a function of @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fu - s ] for the sm . also shown",
    "are the corresponding cross - sections when only one anomalous coupling is non - zero .",
    "the large values of the anomalous couplings have been chosen to highlight the differences .",
    "we see that all four anomalous couplings contribute to the @xmath93 partial cross - section , which can now be parametrized as @xmath95 if only one anomalous coupling @xmath96 were to be non - zero , then the measurement of this partial cross - section would be sensitive to @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the degree of statistical significance , @xmath99 is the integrated luminosity of the @xmath8 collider and @xmath100 is the fractional systematic error . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim - s ] , we show a simple ( @xmath101 ) limit on anomalous couplings , obtained using fig .",
    "[ fig : fu - s ] , for an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath1 . a measurement of @xmath102 will thus be sensitive to values of @xmath96 lying above the corresponding curve .",
    "a similar exercise can be done for @xmath103 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnn](a ) we display the @xmath93 partial cross - section for the same as a function of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "the presence of an additional @xmath74-channel diagram changes the @xmath94 behaviour of the partial cross - section and hence that of the limits that could be inferred in a fashion analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : fu - s ] .    for @xmath70 and @xmath104 , the @xmath105 bounds of table  [ tab : ind - lim ] are much better than the @xmath106 limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim - s ] .",
    "this indicates that asymmetries with appropriate symmetry properties and combinations of various final states can be used efficiently to obtain stringent constraints on anomalous couplings .    for @xmath104 ,",
    "on the other hand , the limit obtained using @xmath107 is only comparable to the one obtained using just the partial rate @xmath108 after accounting for degrees of significance .",
    "however , the limit from @xmath108 is subject to the assumption that all other anomalous couplings are zero , while the one obtained using @xmath107 is independent of any other anomalous coupling .",
    "once again this underscores the importance of specific observables , such as @xmath109 , which receive a contribution from only one of the anomalous coupling , thus allowing us to obtain a robust constraint .    and finally , we look at the @xmath110 channel , where both @xmath3 and @xmath2 vertices contribute thus doubling the number of anomalous couplings involved . since the final state fermions , the neutrinos , are not detectable , it is meaningless to construct the partial cross - section @xmath93",
    ". instead we add @xmath93 and @xmath111 to form the `` forward '' cross - section , _",
