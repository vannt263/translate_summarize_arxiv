    "irreversible phenomena are ubiquitous , and it is a goal of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to describe evolution equations governing such processes .",
    "there are many frameworks of the non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite leading to countless different ways of prescribing the irreversible terms in evolution equations .",
    "we shall discuss two of them , namely the gradient dynamics ( dissipation potentials ) and the entropy production maximization ( epm ) .",
    "when using the gradient dynamics , the irreversible part of evolution equations is given by thermodynamic fluxes @xmath0 which are gradients of a dissipation potential @xmath1 with respect to conjugate variables or thermodynamic forces , @xmath2 : @xmath3 such framework is advocated , for example , by edelen @xcite , where the non - potential part can be regarded as the reversible part as in @xcite , p. 28 , or by recent findings based on the theory of large deviations @xcite .",
    "gradient dynamics also plays a crucial role in the generic framework @xcite , where it guarantees approach to the equilibrium driven by the irreversible part of the evolution equations .",
    "maximization of entropy production is widely used in both theoretical and engineering communities @xcite .",
    "constitutive relations ( thermodynamic fluxes expressed in terms of forces ) are obtained by maximizing a prescribed entropy production @xmath4 subject to constraints such as that the entropy production is a sum of products of thermodynamic forces and fluxes , i.e. , @xmath5 @xmath6 being a lagrange multiplier .",
    "epm describes many nonlinear irreversible phenomena in particular in non - newtonian fluids .",
    "a framework closely related to epm was developed by g. p. beretta , see @xcite and references therein , where entropy production ( as sum of products of forces and fluxes ) is maximized subject to constraints  the steepest entropy ascent ( sea ) .",
    "one of the constraints is a norm of entropy production , which is just the @xmath4 function of epm , and sea means essentially the following : @xmath7 which is equivalent to eq . .",
    "the two methods ( sea and epm ) are thus essentially equivalent , as shown also in @xcite .",
    "therefore , relations between gradient dynamics and epm presented in this paper could be regarded as relations between gradient dynamics and sea .",
    "the novel insight brought in this paper is : ( i ) comparison of epm and gradient dynamics and identification of formulas for entropy production for which both approaches coincide .",
    "( ii ) explicit identification of a step in the procedure of epm that is usually tacitly performed , but for which substantial physical insight is necessary .",
    "we refer to the gradient dynamics as to dynamics generated by a dissipation potential @xmath1 ( convex sufficiently regular function , zero at the origin ) .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the set of state variables .",
    "thermodynamic forces @xmath2 are then related to thermodynamic fluxes @xmath0 through eq .  .",
    "a relation between thermodynamic forces and fluxes is called a constitutive relation .",
    "relation can be seen as a consequence of the legendre transformation    [ eq.lt.xj ] @xmath9 giving the dependence @xmath10 .",
    "the dual dissipation potential is @xmath11    the backward legendre transformation from @xmath12 to @xmath13 proceeds as follows :    [ eq.lt.jx ] @xmath14 and @xmath15    legendre transformation is the natural way for passing between @xmath13 and @xmath12 with relation because no information is lost during the passage , see e.g. callen s textbook @xcite , where the pertinence of the legendre transformation in equilibrium thermodynamics is explained . note also that the forward and backward legendre transformations need the dissipation potential to be non - degenerate , see @xcite for the degenerate case .",
    "onsager reciprocal relations are generalized into far - from - equilibrium regime by using a non - quadratic dissipation potential as shown for example in @xcite . indeed , taking the derivative of both sides of eq .   with respect to the force @xmath16",
    ", we obtain that    @xmath17    and change of variables then leads to equivalent relations @xmath18 called the maxwell  onsager reciprocal relations ( morr ) , see @xcite .",
    "morr can be also seen as conditions necessary for existence of a dissipation potential generating the dynamics .",
    "if they turn out not to be fulfilled , no dissipation potential can be constructed for the given set of thermodynamic forces and fluxes ( and state variables ) .",
    "however , a more detailed level of description could be chosen ( with an extra state variable ) , where the dissipative dynamics could be already given by a dissipation potential , and the possible failure of maxwell  onsager relations on the less detailed level could be interpreted as an effect of hidden dependence on the missing extra state variable .",
    "dissipation potential generates irreversible evolution of a set of state variables @xmath8 , for example @xmath19 conjugate state variables @xmath20 are identified with derivatives of entropy , see @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to identify the state variables with derivatives of energy while keeping energy conservation by adding a source term ( entropy production ) to the balance of entropy density as in @xcite .",
    "the dissipation potential typically depends only on gradients of the conjugate variables , and thermodynamic forces are then just a shorthand for writing down that dependence , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an operator , usually @xmath23 .",
    "one than has @xmath24    for example in classical hydrodynamics , momentum density @xmath25 is among the state variables ( together with density and entropy density ) , and conjugate variables can be identified with derivatives of energy @xmath26 conjugate momentum is thus @xmath27 , which is just the velocity .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic force is the gradient of conjugate momentum , i.e. , the velocity gradient .",
    "that is why the strain rate tensor is to be interpreted as a thermodynamic force while the irreversible cauchy stress as the corresponding flux .",
    "entropy production is given by @xmath28 within the gradient dynamics .",
    "these relations can be seen from equations and , since total entropy of a system evolves as @xmath29 entropy production @xmath4 is thus equal to the product of thermodynamic forces and fluxes as usually in the non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "let us now motivate the gradient dynamics from the point of view of differential geometry .",
    "all the necessary terminology can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the set of state variables @xmath8 forms an infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "right hand sides of the evolution equations of the state variables are then vector fields on the manifold , which belong to the tangent bundle of the manifold , @xmath32 .",
    "the vector fields can be split into the reversible and irreversible part as shown in @xcite , and the irreversible part is in close relation with the thermodynamic fluxes , typically their divergence .",
    "the fluxes can be thus regarded as elements of the tangent bundle .",
    "each point of the tangent bundle can be thus associated with coordinates @xmath33 .    cotangent bundle , which is locally dual to the tangent bundle , can be constructed .",
    "the construction is analogical to the passage from variables @xmath34 to @xmath35 in the classical mechanics .",
    "let us denote elements of the cotangent bundle as @xmath36 . if there is a function on @xmath32 that expresses the irreversible evolution ( dissipation potential @xmath37 ) , what is the corresponding dissipation potential on the cotangent bundle ?",
    "to construct such a function , we first need a mapping from the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle .",
    "moreover , it should map points @xmath38 to points @xmath39 , where the @xmath8 coordinate is the same , the mapping should preserve the fibers .. ] once having a function on @xmath32 , a natural fiber - preserving mapping is the fiber derivative @xmath40 so the new function on the cotangent bundle should be a function of @xmath8 and of the derivatives of the original function @xmath37 . in order not to lose any information ( see @xcite ) contained in @xmath37 , the new function is given by legendre transform of the original function , which is given by eq .  .",
    "constitutive relation can be thus seen as a natural consequence of the duality between tangent and cotangent bundles .    in summary ,",
    "legendre transformation is the natural transformation between functions on tangent and cotangent bundles , and gradient dynamics can be seen as a consequence of this transformation .",
    "let us now formulate the procedure of entropy production maximization ( epm ) . taking entropy production @xmath41 , which is a function of thermodynamic forces , the entropy production should be maximized while keeping the constraint @xmath42 the maximization is carried out by means of the lagrange multipliers technique ,    @xmath43    where @xmath6 is the lagrange multiplier . by solving these two equations , we are able to obtain @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "note that the second equation is equivalent to constraint .",
    "equations imply ( after multiplying eq .   by @xmath2 )",
    "that @xmath44 which gives @xmath6 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    ". then leads to @xmath45 which is the general result ( constitutive relation ) obtained by the method of entropy production maximization .    in the particular case of @xmath46-homogeneous entropy production ,",
    "we have that @xmath47 and eq .   becomes @xmath48 for example the quadratic entropy production @xmath49 is 2-homogeneous , and eq .",
    "yields the standard linear force - flux relations @xmath50 see @xcite .",
    "let us assume system with two fluxes @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are known functions of the forces @xmath53 and @xmath16 .",
    "the entropy production is then given by @xmath54 it could be tempting to identify the thermodynamic fluxes with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but the method of maximum entropy production leads to generally different fluxes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , given by .",
    "it can be shown that the relation between the known fluxes @xmath57 and the fluxes resulting from the maximum entropy production principle @xmath58 is    @xmath59    where the the discrepancy @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 the fluxes are unique if the discrepancy is equal to zero , i.e. , @xmath62 see for example @xcite .",
    "for quadratic entropy production , condition holds if onsager reciprocal relations are satisfied .    in summary , it is important to determine the thermodynamic fluxes by going through the whole procedure of entropy production maximization , which leads to formula . on the other hand , if the fluxes are identified simply from writing down entropy production in the form @xmath63 , the result can be misleading , since there are usually more ways of casting entropy production in that form .      to find the constitutive relations specifying the system by the means of the entropy production maximization , we need to determine how the system stores energy and how it produces entropy  to this end , we need to stipulate two scalar functions .",
    "the general framework goes as follows , for more details see  @xcite .",
    "step 1 : : :    determine the state variables @xmath8 and specify    the storage mechanism of the system by virtue of the fundamental    thermodynamic relation in terms of one of the thermodynamic potentials    ( internal energy @xmath64 , helmholtz free energy    @xmath65 , gibbs potential @xmath66 , enthalpy    @xmath67 ,  ) as a function of the state variables .",

    "when there is only one dissipative process taking place in the physical system , entropy production depends on only one thermodynamic force ( or flux ) . in that case",
    "we can assume the entropy production function to be in the form of @xmath86 . although it can be a sum of several terms that might be non - homogeneous functions , there is no difference between maximization by parts or as a whole . using the relation @xmath87 where the prime @xmath88 denotes the derivation with respect to the argument  the norm @xmath89",

    "we see that for @xmath126 , i.e. , when both terms in   are quadratic , constitutive relations and   are tantamount and we recover the standard model for incompressible heat - conducting newtonian fluid .",
    "since there are materials with the thermal conductivity @xmath115 depending on the shear rate , see for example  @xcite , we hoped that the constitutive relation   given by the entropy production maximization could capture this dependence .",

    "when discussing compatibility of gradient dynamics and epm , a question arises whether the maxwell  onsager relations from sec .",

    "if the condition is not fulfilled , no dissipation potential can be constructed .",
    "in particular , the condition is fulfilled for entropy production when the matrix @xmath129 is symmetric .",

    ", there is a natural way how to distinguish thermodynamic forces and fluxes , missing in the classical non - equilibrium thermodynamic frameworks , e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , onsager reciprocal relations are automatically extended to far - from - equilibrium regimes and the implied maxwell ",
    "onsager reciprocal relations are also guaranteed .",
    "gradient dynamics is advantageous because of this automatic consistence with thermodynamics .    in section [ sec.epm ]",
    "the method of entropy production maximization ( epm ) is recalled , and it is compared with gradient dynamics in section [ sec.comparison ] . both methods are compatible if entropy production is a homogeneous function of thermodynamic forces or fluxes or if it depends on only one force ( or flux ) .",
    "otherwise the compatibility is rather rare .",
    "when performing entropy production maximization , a step is usually tacitly made ( namely step 4a in sec .",
    "[ sec : procedure ] ) where entropy production is split into several parts , each of which is maximized separately . in the case of possible coupling between thermodynamic forces ,",
    "such a step can be done only with great caution , since the resulting coupling is affected by the splitting and since the splitting depends on the not always objective definition of thermodynamic forces , see sec .",
    "[ sec : non - uniq - choice ] .",

    ", the whole entropy production can be maximized at once .",

    "[ sec : heat - power ] .    to compare gradient dynamics and epm ,",
    "a condition is identified , namely eq . , which is equivalent to the validity of maxwell  onsager reciprocal relations for constitutive relations obtained by epm .",
