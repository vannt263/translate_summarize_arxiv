    "one may suggest an alternative way of looking at the same limiting cases , the usefulness of which will become evident later on . let us re - examine the expression for the interfacial contribution , @xmath14 [ eq .  ( [ f0 ] ) ] .",
    "the dla case corresponds to the following description ( see fig .",
    "the interface is all the time at the minimum of the curve @xmath50 , yet the shape of the curve changes with time as @xmath51 is changed by diffusion , until it attains the value of @xmath7 .",

    ", the time scales of these two limiting cases must be compared .",
    "let us start with the dla case and look for the asymptotic time dependence of the process .",
    "we return to the laplace transform of eqs .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) and ( [ dp1dt ] ) and let the conjugate variable of the transform approach zero @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the dla limit is currently considered , we neglect the kinetics at the interface and take @xmath11 to be almost constant .",
    "after inverting back to @xmath52-space , this procedure leads to the following asymptotic time dependence , previously mentioned by hansen @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the equilibrium surface coverage .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) we can identify the characteristic _ time scale of diffusion _",
    ", @xmath55 typical values of @xmath56 correspond to very short times ( of order @xmath57 sec ) , but the prefactor of @xmath58 is usually very large ( of order , say , @xmath59 ) .",
    "thus , the diffusion time scales may reach minutes .    in order to estimate the time scale of the kinetics taking place at the interface , we look at the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ dp0dt ] ) and find @xcite , @xmath60 since the value of @xmath2 at the interface is not expected to be drastically smaller than that inside the solution , comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ td ] ) and ( [ tk ] ) leads to the conclusion that @xmath61 .",
    "we thus expect , in general , that _ non - ionic surfactants should exhibit diffusion - limited adsorption_. this is one of the conclusions of our study as applied to non - ionic surfactants , and has been observed for quite a large number of such surfactants @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat expected , since we did not include in the interfacial free energy , eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , any potential barrier that might lead to kinetic limitations .",
    "the  footprint \" of dla is the asymptotic time dependence ( see eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath62 for any reasonable dependence between the surface tension and surface coverage , @xmath63 $ ] , we expect the surface tension to also exhibit a similar asymptotic time dependence , @xmath64 .",
    "it should be compared with the asymptotic _ exponential _ time dependence in the case of kla [ eq .",
    "( [ tk ] ) ] .",
    "four examples of experimental results are given in fig .",
    "3 , all exhibiting an asymptotic @xmath65 behavior , as expected for dla .",
    "having realized that the adsorption is diffusion - limited , the mathematical solution of the problem amounts to the simultaneous solution of two equations : ( i ) the ward - tordai equation , ( [ wt ] ) , accounting for the diffusive transport ; ( ii ) an isotherm , such as ( [ frumkin ] ) ( with @xmath42 replacing @xmath8 ) , describing the ( immediate ) response of the surface coverage to changes in the sub - surface layer of solution .",
    "useful numerical schemes were suggested for performing such a task @xcite , yielding the time - dependent surface coverage , @xmath49 .",
    "since most experiments measure dynamic surface tensions and not surface coverages , we still need a relation between these two variables in order to relate theoretical calculations to actual measurements .",
    "we return , therefore , to the evolution of the interfacial tension during a dla process . as was stated above , in this limit the interfacial contribution , @xmath50 ,",
    "is all the time at its minimum .",
    "we can , therefore , write @xmath12 = \\int_0^\\infty \\delta f[\\phi(x ) ] dx +           \\frac{1}{a^2 } \\left [ t\\ln(1-\\phi_0 ) + \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\phi_0 ^ 2           \\right].\\ ] ] if , in addition , the contribution from the bulk solution is neglected ( recalling that it completely vanishes when equilibrium is reached ) , we are left with the equilibrium relation , eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) .",
    "hence , the equilibrium equation of state , relating the surface tension to the surface coverage , holds approximately also out of equilibrium .",
    "note , that this conclusion is valid only in the case of _ diffusion - limited adsorption_.    practically all previous works assumed that the equilibrium relation between the surface tension and surface coverage holds for the _ dynamic _ surface tension as well .",
    "as we have just found , non - ionic surfactants usually do undergo dla .",
    "hence , the assumption employed by previous works was justified , as far as non - ionic surfactants were concerned .",
    "indeed , satisfactory agreement with experimental findings is obtained , when results of the numerical schemes mentioned above are related to the dynamic surface tension via the equilibrium equation of state @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion is drastically modified for _ ionic _ surfactants , as we show in the next section .    the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath11 , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "note the moderate slope in the beginning of the process ; the surface coverage significantly changes without a corresponding change in the surface tension .",
    "it is a result of the competition between the entropy and interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) . as the surface coverage increases ,",
    "the surface tension starts falling until reaching its equilibrium value .",
    "since @xmath11 monotonically increases with time during the adsorption , we expect the _ time _ dependence of @xmath9 to resemble the schematic curve depicted in fig .",
    "4b : a slow change in the beginning , then a rapid drop , and eventually a relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "this is , indeed , in agreement with dynamic surface tension measurements ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "returning to fig .  4a , the surface tension will start its rapid fall roughly when the second derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath11 changes sign , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath66 as one examines surfactant solutions of increasing bulk concentrations ( but always below the _ cmc _ ) , the surface coverage corresponding to the beginning of the drop in surface tension will be reached earlier along the process .",
    "the initial period of slow change in the tension will shrink , until finally vanishing behind the finite experimental resolution .",
    "this trend is observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the need for an interaction between surfactant molecules in order to account for such a time dependence of surface tensions was previously realized by lin _",
    "they even suggested the existence of a transition from a gaseous to a liquid phase as being responsible for the initial period of almost constant tension .",
    "in fact , the form of @xmath14 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) may account for a two - phase region , but only if @xmath67 . as demonstrated above in fig .  4 ( where @xmath68 ) , this is not necessary , however , for recovering the experimentally observed time dependence .",
    "we now consider the problem of _ ionic _ surfactant adsorption . the main difference compared to the previous , non - ionic case is the introduction of electrostatic interactions .",
    "the kinetics of the system include , apart from the diffusive transport of molecules and their adsorption at the interface , the formation of an electric double layer due to the increasing surface charge .",
    "we start with the case of a salt - free solution , where the only charges present are those of the surfactant ions and their balancing counter - ions .",
    "the system is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "5 . in such a case",
    "the electrostatic interactions are unscreened , and thus , as we shall see , have a drastic effect on the adsorption process . instead of the single degree of freedom we have specified in the non - ionic case , namely the surfactant profile , @xmath69 , we should consider here three degrees of freedom : the surfactant ion profile , @xmath70 , the counter - ion profile , @xmath71 , and the local mean electric potential , @xmath72 ( without loss of generality , we take the surfactant ions as the positive ones ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume the following : ( i ) the surfactant molecules are fully ionized ; ( ii ) the surfactant ions and counter - ions are monovalent ( extension to general valencies , however , is quite straightforward within our mean - field formulation ) ; ( iii ) as in the previous section , the solution is assumed to be dilute . in the current context",
    "this last assumption also allows us to treat the surfactant and counter - ion volume fractions as independent variables , as the probability for an ion and a counter - ion to overlap at the same spatial position is negligible .",
    "in addition , and without loss of generality , we take the surfactant ions to be the positive ones .    the extension of the model to ionic surfactants evidently demonstrates the benefits of the free - energy formulation we have employed .",

    "it should be interesting to examine aqueous solutions with low salt concentrations and observe the crossover from one limiting behavior to another .",
    "moreover , since the adsorption in the case of salt - free ionic surfactant solutions has been found to be kinetically limited , dynamic surface tension measurements may be used to `` probe '' the actual dependence of the interfacial free energy , @xmath50 , on the surface coverage , @xmath11 .",
    "this , in turn , may help explain the equilibrium phase behavior of ionic surfactant monolayers under various conditions ( _ e.g. _ , under compression ) .",
