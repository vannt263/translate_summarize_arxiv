    "a carbon nanotube is a cylindrical structure  @xcite that can be thought as the result of the wrapping up of a single graphene sheet  @xcite over itself . in the same way that * , * in the past * , * graphene sheets were always found stacked to form graphite , carbon nanotubes were always found forming nanotube bundles , structures in which the only surfaces available for adsorption were the exposed parts of the tubes in the fringes of the bundle  @xcite .",
    "the adsorbed phases in a planar structure such as graphite are quite different from the ones observed on a highly patterned substrate like the external surface of a nanotube bundle .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the results on a bundle of carbon nanotubes and graphite for @xmath2he @xcite ( bundles ) @xcite ( graphite ) , h@xmath0 @xcite ( bundles ) @xcite ( graphite ) , and ne @xcite ( bundles ) and @xcite ( graphite ) .",
    "similar to the opportunities for adsorption that the achievement of a single graphene sheet offers , a recent experimental work shows the proper technique to suspend a single carbon nanotube and study the phases of different gases ( ar , kr ) adsorbed on its external surface  @xcite . in this latter work",
    ", the results indicated that the phase diagrams were similar to those of the same gases on graphite , but with phase transitions shifted to higher pressures . in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the adsorption behavior of h@xmath0 on a series of armchair ( ( n , n ) ) carbon nanotubes with different diameters in order to see if a quantum gas would exhibit novel phases when adsorbed on curved surfaces .",
    "the carbon nanotubes considered , together with their indexes and radii , are given in table i. the most noticeable results driven from our calculations are : _ i _ ) , the existence of a solid - solid phase transition for ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) nanotubes , and _ ii _ ) , the stability of the curved version of the @xmath3 commensurate phase only for the widest nanotube studied ( 16,16 ) .",
    "our calculations were performed with the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method . this well - established technique allows us to solve exactly the schroedinger equation within some statistical errors to obtain the ground state energy of a system of interacting bosons  @xcite .",
    "this is exactly our case , since in its lowest energy state ( @xmath4-h@xmath0 ) the hydrogen molecule behaves as a boson . to apply the dmc algorithm",
    ", we need the potentials to describe the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 interaction ( we chose the silvera and goldman expression  @xcite , a standard model for calculations involving @xmath4-h@xmath0 ) , and the c - h@xmath0 one . for the latter",
    ", we used a lennard - jones potential with parameters taken from ref .",
    ", as used previously to describe the phase diagram of h@xmath0 adsorbed on graphene @xcite .",
    "all the individual c - h@xmath0 pairs were considered , i.e. , we took into consideration the corrugation effects due to the real structure of the nanotube .",
    "the last ingredient needed to perform a calculation in a dmc scheme is a trial wave function .",
    "it regulates the monte carlo importance sampling , and can be considered as a variational approximation to the exact description of the system . in this work , we used a trial wave function formed by the product of two terms .",
    "the first one is @xmath5 }   \\label{trial1 } \\\\   & & \\times \\prod_i   \\prod_j \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{b_{{\\text c}{\\text -}{\\text   h}_2}}{r_{ij } } \\right)^5 \\right ]    \\prod_i \\exp ( -a ( r_i - r_0)^2 ) \\nonumber \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  , @xmath8 are the coordinates of the h@xmath0 molecules and @xmath9 the position of the carbon atoms in the nanotube .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ trial1 ] ) is a two - body jastrow function depending on the h@xmath0 intermolecular distances @xmath10 , while the second one has the same meaning but for each @xmath11 ( c - h@xmath0 ) . finally , the third term is a product of one - body gaussians with @xmath12 , that depend on the distance of each h@xmath0 to the center of the tube ( @xmath13 ) .",
    ".armchair carbon nanotubes considered in this work , together with their tube radii ( @xmath14 ) and the most probable distance for an adsorbed hydrogen molecule to the center of the cylinder ( @xmath13 ) . in the last column , the adsorption energy of a single h@xmath0 molecule ( @xmath15 ) is reported . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "summarizing , we studied all the possible h@xmath0 phases adsorbed on the surface of armchair carbon nanotubes ranging from ( 5,5 ) to ( 16,16 ) . in all cases , but the last one , we have found that the stable phases are incommensurate solids formed by molecules adsorbed on circumferences perpendicular to the main tube axis .",
    "where the curvature of the surface is more relevant , i.e. , in the narrowest tubes [ ( 5,5),(6,6 ) ] , our results show the existence of a solid - solid zero - temperature phase transition between two incommensurate structures . the first commensurate solid phase , curved version of the well - known @xmath3 phase , appears only when the radius of the nanotube is big enough : a ( 16,16 ) tube for h@xmath0 .",
