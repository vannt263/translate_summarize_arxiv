    "these were formulated as an expansion in a coupling parameter .",
    "one such parameter is @xmath2 , viz . , the ratio of the coulomb energy to the kinetic energy .",
    "the coulomb energy is of the order of @xmath3 , where the wigner - seitz radius @xmath4 is the radius of the sphere containing one ion .",

    "the coupling parameter @xmath9 for electrons is of the order of 160 . even at very high temperatures ,",
    "the system remains strongly - coupled for a large range of conditions , because the ionic charge @xmath1 increases with @xmath0 from 3 to 13 when full ionization is achieved . hence expressing physical properties as a series expansion in @xmath2 , or within a hierarchy of equations based on @xmath2 becomes non convergent .",
    "sccs meetings recorded the progress in treating systems , classical or quantum , with coupling parameters larger than unity .",
    "the electrons in electron - ion systems are quantum mechanical for a large range of conditions because of the high fermi energy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the system is mostly in the ` warm ' , strongly - correlated matter ( wcm ) regime since @xmath12 and @xmath13 . a sub - class of wcm is often known as ` warm - dense matter ' ( wdm )  @xcite .",
    "the theory of wcms involves finite-@xmath0 atomic physics , finite-@xmath0 continuum states inclusive of @xmath14-@xmath14 , @xmath14-@xmath15 and @xmath15-@xmath15 correlations .",

    "there are @xmath21 species of particles since electrons have two spin states . treating spin types",

    "thus there are @xmath22 coupling constants @xmath23 to deal with .",
    "clearly , even when shell - structure is absent , perturbation methods , or truncations of hierarchies of equations ( e.g. , the bbgky equations , zubarev s equations of motion ) can not be used , unless some guidance from benchmark results is available .",

    "gabor kalman s inaugural meeting in 1977  @xcite have ranged from europe , usa , japan to moscow  @xcite and more , playing a pivotal role in bringing leading scientists together . in the 1970s the sccs - community studied simple ` benchmark ' systems like the one - component classical plasma ( ocp ) described by the single parameter @xmath2 .",

    "however , theories of electron - ion systems need a tractable quantum treatment of the @xmath15-@xmath14 and @xmath15-@xmath15 interactions .",
    "the traditional approach to the @xmath25-electron problem is to fix the nuclei in given positions @xmath26 and solve the schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation .",
    "this uses a many - electron wave function @xmath27 expressed as a sum of all possible slater determinants @xmath28 of rank @xmath25 made up of one - electron  basis \" functions , @xmath29 in number , with @xmath30 .",
    "each @xmath28 expresses an electron configuration for the fixed @xmath26 .",
    "this approach to approximating @xmath27 is known as configuration interaction ( ci ) .",
    "the @xmath15-@xmath15 interactions involve four ( two incoming , and two outgoing ) states .",
    "they give rise to @xmath31 coulomb and exchange terms for each @xmath28 . furthermore",
    "( i ) the ci problem grows in complexity as a non - polynomial function of @xmath25 , even faster than the legendary hydra - head .",
    "( ii ) the calculations have to be repeated for many sets of @xmath26 and a configuration average has to be taken . the born - oppenheimer approximation used in this approach",
    "is not valid when ion - electron coupled - modes are formed , or near the center of spectral lines where ion dynamics become important .",
    "( iii ) for finite-@xmath0 problems , the number of angular momentum states @xmath32 needed in continuum - state basis functions of the type @xmath33 , of positive energy @xmath34 ( in atomic units ) rises very rapidly .",
    "then even hartree - fock calculations become prohibitive at finite-@xmath0 .",
    "this hopeless situation was saved by the formulation of dft in 1964 by hohenberg and kohn  @xcite . the historical background to dft",
    "is given in an essay by zangwill  @xcite .",
    "in dft , the many - body @xmath27 is dispensed with , and the ordinary density @xmath35 in the fixed external potential ( of the ions ) determines the physics of the system .",
    "this requires knowing the kinetic energy as an explicit functional of @xmath35 .",
    "as this is not known , the practical implementation of dft is via the kohn - sham method where the @xmath35 at equilibrium is obtained from a hartree - like equation .",
    "the @xmath25-electron many - body problem is rigorously converted into an effective single - electron problem , and the many - body effects are buried in a one - body exchange - correlation potential @xmath36)$ ] whose existence is proved , but whose form is not available from dft itself .",
    "the @xmath37 formalism was extended to finite-@xmath0 by mermin where the free energy @xmath24 becomes a functional of the finite-@xmath0 one - body density @xmath38 .",
    "these developments were reported in the sccs - conference series .",

    "this leads to _ two _ coupled variational equations  @xcite , one being a modified kohn - sham equation , while the other defines the variational equation for the ion distribution .",
    "( b ) the construction of exchange - correlation functionals @xmath42,t)$ ] , and @xmath42,[\\rho],t)$ ] for finite-@xmath0 coulomb systems  @xcite .",
    "( c ) the construction of two - temperature pseudopotentials and pair potentials for sccs  @xcite .",
    "( d ) their use for calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) over many orders of temperature and density  @xcite . ( e )",
    "calculation of transport properties , e.g. , electrical and heat conductivity  @xcite .",
    "( f ) plasma spectroscopy , opacity ( line widths , absorption , emission ) , and scattering  @xcite . (",
    "g ) laser- and shock- created plasmas , their energy relaxation and transient ( optical and transport ) properties  @xcite .",
    "( h ) search for simpler computational schemes , for example , classical potentials mimicking quantum effects , classical maps  @xcite , orbital - free methods etc .",
    "their application to the eos , e.g. , of hydrogen  @xcite , and the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )  @xcite in multi - component systems are presented , with some new results for graphene .",
    "in describing the physical properties of a many - body system , empirical models and approximate interaction potentials construed to give optimal results for specific properties usually fail for other properties .",
    "if the full many - body wavefunction @xmath43 where @xmath44 are nuclear positions is available , all properties can be consistently calculated from @xmath27 . however , the @xmath27 with or even without the dependence on @xmath45 is not available , except for some small systems or model problems .",
    "since the one - particle density @xmath46 replaces @xmath27 in dft , all properties become self - consistent if they are formulated as functionals of @xmath46 .",
    "all properties of systems interacting via a two - body potential ( e.g. , the coulomb potential ) can be formulated transparently via pair - distribution functions ( pdfs ) . a convenient way to relate pdfs to the one - body theory used in dft is to to use a system of coordinates with one of the particle ( e.g. , an ion ) chosen as the origin @xmath47 .",
    "then the particle correlations become manifest via the pdfs .",
    "the one - body density @xmath46 becomes an effective two - body density @xmath48 . for extended systems ,",
    "such two - body densities relate simply to the corresponding pair - distribution functions @xmath49 and the mean densities @xmath50 far away from the origin .",
    "thus , assuming spherical symmetry typical of fluids , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 hold .",
    "hohenberg - kohn theory implies that : @xmath54,[\\rho])}{\\delta n(r)}=0 ; \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\frac{\\delta f([n],[\\rho(r)])}{\\delta \\rho(r)}=0;\\ ] ] in the usual formulations of dft , only the first equation is considered and the ions provide a  fixed external potential \" . the first equation is usually reduced to the kohn - sham equation , invoking an exchange - correlation potential acting on the electrons , while @xmath55 is fixed . however , wcm calculations need a self - consistent evaluation of @xmath55 , to within the quasi - equilibrium time scales of the problem which may impose different temperatures to the different subsystems .",
    "wcm calculations also need an extended form of xc - potentials which are functionals of both @xmath35 and @xmath55 .",
    "that is , ideally , the applicable xc - potential has to be obtained _ in situ _ , as a non - local quantity from a @xmath56 which is coupled to a calculation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is largely achieved in the classical - map hnc - technique ( chnc )  @xcite that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ eos - h ] .    if dft is valid , the only information required to describe ( at least ) the linear transport properties of the system are just the equilibrium pdfs , be it a quantum system , or a classical or mixed system , at @xmath37 or finite @xmath0 , without requiring a wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation contributions are contained in the pdfs , and can be extracted using coupling - constant integrations  @xcite .",
    "the problem is to determine the pdfs for multi - component sccs .",
    "however , once they are determined via dft , the eos , bound states , scattering phase shifts , static and dynamic conductivities , energy - relaxation rates , opacities , electromagnetic scattering etc .",
    ", come out to be consistent with each other . here",
    "we note that any pdf , i.e. , @xmath59 , is connected with the corresponding static structure factor @xmath60 , while @xmath61 determines spectra and time dependent properties .",
    "this theory can be developed without making the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the ion correlations in strongly - coupled systems have to be mandatorily treated via a non - local ion - correlation theory since the local - density approximation fails badly for ions  @xcite .",
    "hence , from the outset we formulate sccs problems in terms of pdfs and structure factors of the system , as reported in sccs - meetings in santa cruz  @xcite and subsequently .",
    "this approach contrasts that used in _ ab initio _ codes like _ vasp _ or _ ab - init _ designed for condensed -matter physics . in such codes the ion positions are fixed , and specified as periodic repetitions of a simulation cell .",
    "the @xmath0=0 one - electron kohn - sham functions for a fixed ion configuration ( born - oppenheimer approximation ) are determined , and the calculations are repeated for many static - ion configurations , to obtain averaged physical properties . a thermal smearing of the one -electron occupation numbers is introduced to take account of finite-@xmath0 effects in a somewhat phenomenological way , and so far no serious attempts to use finite-@xmath0 versions of @xmath62 $ ] or finite-@xmath0 pseudopotentials have been made .",
    "the kohn - sham eigenfunctions are rigorously identifiable as states of the one - electron excitation spectrum only in the limit of negligible electron- electron interactions .",
    "they are merely lagrange multipliers in the variational equations leading to the kohn - sham form .",
    "nevertheless , they are ( non - rigorously ) used as valid single - electron states and excitation energies in , say , the kubo - greenwood formula to calculate transport properties of these systems .",
    "alternatively , path - integral methods can be used , especially for hot systems where @xmath63 .",
    "quantum monte carlo is available at @xmath37 , for small numbers of electrons .",
    "owing to the finite size of the simulation cells , extrapolations to large-@xmath25 are needed , and results from different boundary conditions ( e.g.,periodic versus twisted , etc . ) and different treatments of ` backflow ' can be dramatically different , especially with respect to exchange - correlation driven phase transitions which are difficult to predict  @xcite .",
    "the approach based on pdfs lends naturally to modeling the system within a ` correlation sphere ' ( cs ) built around a central nucleus , encompassing all particle correlations .",
    "the cs , with a radius @xmath64 - 10 @xmath4 encloses the ion distribution @xmath55 and the associated electron distribution @xmath35 forming a neutral system , labeled the ` neutral pseudoatom ' ( npa ) , introduced by ziman as a name , and formulated in detail by l. dagens  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to approximately replace the interacting system of @xmath25 nuclei and their electrons with an equivalent _ superposition of independent charge distributions _",
    "@xmath65 centered on each nucleus at @xmath44 , referred to as ` neutral pseudoatoms ' .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "the 1st step is to obtain @xmath35 , and the corresponding pseudopotentials @xmath66 and pair - potentials @xmath67 .",

    "bridge - corrections to the hnc are needed for large-@xmath2 systems.the two - step implementation , involving first the npa - dft , and then the hnc for @xmath55 can be merged into a single iterative scheme of a correlation - sphere dft - hnc model , as in ref .",
    "but this is harder to converge .",
    "a single nucleus is used as the ` central object ' in the npa .",
    "hence the method does not explicitly treat the formation of molecules and atomic clusters .",
