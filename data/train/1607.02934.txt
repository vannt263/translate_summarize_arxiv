    "in contrast to time - of - flight absorption imaging where densities are low and the mean - field interaction between the atoms is negligible , the interaction s influence on the cloud s density profile has to be taken into account in the case of in - trap images . instead of taking the complete influence of mean - field interactions on the condensed and thermal part in a self - consistent way into account , we employ the so - called ` semi - ideal ' model @xcite , which only includes the interactions of the condensed part on the thermal part which leads to a modified effective trapping potential for the thermal part : @xmath32    in the thomas - fermi approximation , the condensed and thermal cloud s density distributions are then given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thermal de - broglie wavelength . usually , the chemical potential @xmath35 and the number of condensed atoms @xmath36 have to be determined self - consistently .",

    "given atoms in the same internal state with @xmath12 axis angular momentum projection @xmath46 the spatially dependent faraday rotation is @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the excited state lifetime , @xmath49 the imaging light wavelength , @xmath10 the excited state detuning and @xmath50 is the density distribution .    the resulting image is azimuthally averaged around the point with the highest rotation angle ( see fig .

    "fig : faraday_singleprobe](a ) ) shows a systematic shift towards higher bec fractions in the in - situ images and best agreement for long durations .    to understand the origin of this trend we model the effect of finite photon numbers on the determination of bec fractions .",
    "for a given photon flux and cloud profile we generate sample images which include the poissonian statistics of the imaging light and apply the fitting procedure described previously . the mean and standard deviation in bec fraction",

    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : faraday_singleprobe](b ) demonstrate a clear , systematic shift consistent with observations .",

    "the range of photon fluxes used in the experiment ( yellow bar ) indicate that agreement between in - situ and absorption imaging can not be expected for higher condensate fractions .",

    "the total atom number nrf is higher than 10 for points close to the bec transition and decreases significantly to almost 2 for the data points at the lowest final evaporation power , .",
    "this drastic drop in predictability is attributed to a combination of small classical fluctuations of the trap bottom and quantum noise arising due to the stochastic nature of the condensate formation .",
    "as described in the main letter , experimental outcomes are subject to systematic shifts as soon as the control variable fluctuates and the system shows a non - linear response .",
    "this effect can be understood and quantified by the following argument , which is valid for any measurement with a controlled but fluctuating variable . assuming a control variable @xmath23 that fluctuates around its mean by some amount @xmath59 , each realization of an experimental outcome following some function @xmath25 will be measured at slightly different values @xmath60 .",
    "the mean measurement result @xmath61 will simply be the convolution of the true response function with the distribution of the control variable . in the case of a normally distributed fluctuating control variable with variance @xmath24 and assuming that the fluctuations are sufficiently small such that @xmath25 can be approximated by its taylor expansion to second order , one finds a relatively simple differential equation showing the introduced systematic shift , @xmath62 .",
    "a more general calculation leads to the same result even for non - gaussian distributions of control values  .",

    "this is illustrated by the fact that the dataset corresponding to the highest probe duration is not pulled as much towards zero around the transition as the other series .",
    "for this reason we define the transition point as the level of evaporation power where the fitted bec fraction reaches 10% , and define its error from the 1@xmath65 confidence bounds .",

    "<S> this effect can be understood based on the following argument , which is valid for any measurement with a noisy control parameter . assuming a control parameter @xmath23 that is fluctuating with a variance @xmath24 , the average over many realizations of an experimental outcome following some function @xmath25 yields a systematically shifted value @xmath26  @xcite . in the case of averaging all data </S>",

    "<S> this highlights the usefulness of the db - approach for the sensitivity - enhancement of general quantum simulation experiments . in this particular case , </S>",
    "<S> the benchmark method yields a prediction precision improvement of a factor of 10 compared to the necessarily conservative estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the relative simplicity of the technique , which can easily be implemented in existing setups as a post - selection tool or used to study the stochastisticity of quantum phase transition dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> to quantify the predictability in more detail , we compare the variance of absorption measurements in the vicinity of the bec transition to the conditional variance given the knowledge of the benchmarking probe . </S>",
    "<S> slightly before the transition point , we obtain a reduction in variance by a factor 14 , whereas after the transition point the reduction decreases steadily ending at roughly 2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this drastic drop to a combination of small classical fluctuations , such as trap bottom instabilities , and quantum noise arising due to the stochastic nature of the condensation process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the drop demonstrates that single benchmark measurements can not give detailed information on the stochastic dynamics in the region around the quantum phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore turn to a natural extension of this approach ; repeated probing of the crossing of the phase transition in a single realization . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two cases : first repeated probing of evaporative cooling and second probing of multiple consecutive conservative phase transition crossings .        </S>",
    "<S> based on a detailed understanding of the individual in - situ images  @xcite , we repeatedly probe the sample in a single evaporative run . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate goal is accurate probing of the transition at the quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is at present limited by classical fluctuations in the probing light and the trap geometry as well as insufficient imaging resolution , which will be topics of future research . </S>",
    "<S> here we address an important first step : the modification of the phase transition due to the heating caused by the probing . </S>",
    "<S> this is important for all future studies due to the intrinsic trade - off between destructivity and signal to noise in dispersive probing .    during the final stages of the evaporation process up to 6 pulses </S>",
    "<S> are taken at intervals for various pulse durations . </S>",
    "<S> after the final pulse in the sequence an absorption image is taken and the condensed fraction extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this in - situ probing of the condensation process using three different probe durations are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dimple](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a clear shift of the bec transition point towards lower dipole powers and shallower traps is observed for increasing pulse durations due to heating . </S>",
    "<S> the red curve in fig .  [ fig : dimple](a ) demonstrates the systematic shift introduced by the faraday probing which is confirmed by absorption images at the end of the sequence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed heating rate is somewhat higher than simple theoretical estimates would suggest , which we attribute both to classical variations in probing conditions and to multiple scattering events due to the high spatial density . </S>",
    "<S> our results reinforce the need to consider heating effects in future studies of the quantum effects of dispersive probing  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the entire bec phase transition diagram can be mapped in a single - run using the periodic addition of a focused `` dimple '' potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dimple allows for the repeated conservative crossing between thermal cloud and bec . </S>",
    "<S> studies to date have only employed this effect in combination with individual , destructive absorption images : bec production has been characterized @xcite and in one pioneering experiment multiple crossings explored  @xcite . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> the evaporation is stopped before condensation is reached . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the cloud serves as a reservoir in which a wavelength laser beam focused to a waist of produces an additional potential . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> this potential is periodically cycled from a depth of @xmath29 to .    </S>",
    "<S> we first characterize the cloud evolution with absorption imaging . </S>",
    "<S> maximum bec atom numbers of around 1.5@xmath30  atoms , 10% of the total atom number , are measured while after 30  cycles the condensed cloud of 2@xmath31  atoms is still distinguishable from the thermal reservoir , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dimple](b ) . the total atom number decay and the reservoir temperature increase </S>",
    "<S> are used to estimate a critical dimple depth . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can place the experimental results into two groups on a phase diagram , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dimple](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation dynamics in the dimple involves three parts of the sample ( reservoir , bec and thermal fractions in the dimple ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even a simple model  @xcite can predict the presence / absence of a bec reasonably well during the first 20 cycles . </S>",
    "<S> inaccuracy in the measurement of the reservoir temperature and non - adiabatic dimple loading dynamics reduce the effectiveness of the model to make predictions on the final cycles .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we perform the first dispersive probing of multiple quantum phase transitions by introducing a varying number of weak faraday pulses within each dimple cycle at different pulse durations . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : dimple](b ) red squares indicate the maximal angle of faraday rotation obtained in each probing pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero signal in the absence of the dimple is caused by the background polarisation rotation of the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the data clearly demonstrate our ability to track the loading into the dimple over two realizations of the bec production . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the destructivity of the probing by interrupting the probing at various points and determine the number of condensed atoms using absorption imaging . for a single weak probe applied repeatedly at maximum dimple power </S>",
    "<S> at least 10 dimple cycles can be monitored whereas only a few transitions can be monitored when seven pulses per cycle are applied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that both correlation measurements between , as well as high - resolution monitoring of , several quantum phase transitions in a single shot should be feasible .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the predictive power of non - destructively probing a cold cloud before it crosses the bec phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this provides enhanced information about the non - linear dependence of a phase transition on a control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> importantly we demonstrate that using conventional methods the precision of a quantum simulation does not necessarily increase with additional repetitions unlike our method . </S>",
    "<S> we envision similar techniques to be applicable for any quantum many - body phase transition in which classical fluctuations play a role . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have demonstrated repeated probing of both one and several phase transitions in a single shot . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the single - realization mapping of full phase diagrams as well as the investigation of stochastic effects such as increased fluctuations at the phase transition  @xcite and possible non - markovian dynamics @xcite for multiple crossings . </S>"
