    "the iron k@xmath0 line is arguably the most important feature in the hard x - ray spectrum of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) .",
    "sensitive measurements of the shape and energy of the line could provide information on the velocity and ionization state of the accretion flow , as well as constraining the properties of the central black hole ( see the recent review by fabian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the line is thought to arise from the fluorescence of irradiated optically - thick material , most likely the accretion disc itself . with the launch of the high - throughput telescope _ xmm - newton _ , high signal - to - noise detections of the fe k@xmath0 line will soon be common .",
    "it is therefore important that the models of x - ray reflection are suitably advanced to take advantage of this high - quality data .    in this contribution , we present new calculations of x - ray reflection from an ionized accretion disc , and concentrate on the properties of the fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "it will be shown that emission from ionized fe is quite common over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "the calculations were performed using the code described in detail by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) and ballantyne , ross , & fabian ( 2001 ) .",
    "the program computes the reflection spectrum from an optically thick layer of gas over the energy range 0.001 to 100  kev .",
    "the incident radiation is in the form of a power - law with photon index @xmath1 which strikes the gas with a flux @xmath2 and at an incidence angle of @xmath3 degrees to the normal .",
    "the atmosphere then relaxes into thermal , ionization and pressure equilibrium before the reflection spectrum is computed .",
    "the transfer of the illuminating radiation is treated analytically in a one - stream approximation . the diffuse radiation ( that from the disc , the gas , and the scattered component of the illuminating radiation ) is treated using the fokker - planck / diffusion method ( ross , weaver , & mccray 1978 ) .",
    "the calculations are one - dimensional and occur at a radius @xmath4 along the accretion disc ( @xmath5 schwarszchild radii for all the models presented below ) .",
    "we include levels from c  v  vii , o  v  ix , mg  ix  xiii , si  xi ",
    "xv , and fe  xvi  xxvii with the abundances of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . the radiation pressure from both the impinging and diffuse radiation",
    "is included in determining hydrostatic balance .",
    "calculations were performed using both the gas and radiation pressure dominated boundary conditions with no energy dissipation in the corona as described by merloni , fabian , & ross ( 2000 ) .",
    "figure  1 presents results from the models run with the assumption of a gas pressure dominated accretion disc .    in these cases ,",
    "the illuminating radiation was incident on a disc that was accreting at 0.001 of the eddington rate for a 10@xmath6  m@xmath7 black hole ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the incident flux was 10@xmath9  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath11 , the incidence angle was set so that @xmath12 , and @xmath1 was varied from 1.6 to 2.2 .",
    "the left hand panel shows that ionized fe lines at 6.7 and 6.97  kev were found to be prominent for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated in the right hand panel of figure  1 .",
    "here , we plot the temperature of the gas versus the thomson depth of the gas in the illuminated atmosphere .",
    "the gas temperature decreases rapidly , but not discontinuously ( cf .",
    "nayakshin , kazanas , & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "there is a zone at @xmath13  k which is kept thermally stable by a balance of photoelectric heating and a combination of line and bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "this zone of stability allows sufficient quantities of helium - like and hydrogenic iron to exist and imprint their features on the reflection spectrum . for harder illuminating spectra ( smaller @xmath1 ) , iron is fully ionized to greater depth until the fe lines disappear almost entirely .",
    "ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also find ionized fe lines when the other model parameters , such as @xmath2 , have been varied .",
    "the left - hand panel presents results for when radiation pressure dominated boundary conditions were assumed , allowing calculations at higher accretion rates . in these models ,",
    "the accretion rate around a 10@xmath6  m@xmath7 black hole was varied , and the illuminating parameters were held fixed at the following values : @xmath14 , @xmath15  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath11 , and @xmath16 . as before ,",
    "a line at 6.7  kev from helium - like fe was found for every value of the accretion rate that was considered .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  2 compares two different calculations of the @xmath17 model from the left - hand panel .",
    "the solid line denotes a model that was calculated with an oxygen abundance one - fifth of solar , while the dashed line denotes the solar abundance model from the other panel .",
    "changing the abundance of oxygen could potentially impact the stability of the small plateau in the temperature structure of the atmosphere , and therefore affect which fe k@xmath0 line dominates the reflection spectrum .",
    "however , as fig . 2 illustrates , changing the oxygen abundance does not have an impact on the ionization state of the predicted fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "these results show that ionized fe lines are expected from agn reflection spectra over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "this could have important implications on determining the structure of accretion discs and how they are illuminated .",
    "however , disentangling ionization effects from instrumental and/or relativistic ones will be a challenge with current instruments .",
