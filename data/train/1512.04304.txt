    "the hamiltonian constraint for the spatially homogenous and diagonal bianchi class a models , discussed e.g. in ref .  , and",
    "filled with a perfect fluid reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the momentum of barotropic fluid with @xmath2 .",
    "the misner variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe respectively the isotropic and anisotropic components of the evolving three - geometry , whose ricci curvature is encoded in the potential @xmath5 .",
    "we solve the above constraint by setting @xmath6 as a clock and removing @xmath7 from the framework .",
    "we find the true non - vanishing hamiltonian : @xmath8 which generates dynamics in the physical phase space @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath10 is positive .",
    "the dynamics resembles the motion of a particle in the half - line @xmath10 in some potential .",
    "the potential is due to the shear and the intrinsic curvature",
    ". the particle hits the singularity @xmath11 at a finite value of clock @xmath6 .",
    "the quantization of anisotropic pairs @xmath12 , which are real , can be based on the usual canonical prescription . on the other hand , the isotropic variables @xmath13",
    "have the range of the half - plane and their quantization must follow a suitably adapted prescription .",
    "in fact , the cosmological phase space @xmath13 may be identified with the affine group , which is given by the multiplication law : @xmath14 its unitary irreducible and integrable representation in @xmath15 reads : @xmath16 given a vector @xmath17 , a continuous family of unit vectors may be defined @xmath18 by the virtue of schur s lemma they resolve unity : @xmath19 the following quantization map respects the symmetries of the cosmological phase space : @xmath20 the above quantization is covariant with respect to the affine group rather then weyl - heisenberg group .",
    "moreover , it has all the demanded properties : ( i ) it is linear , ( ii ) to @xmath21 it assigns identity and ( iii ) to semi - bounded @xmath22 it assigns semi - bounded operators . since there exist infinitely many possible families of states @xmath23 , which depend on the choice of @xmath24 , there follow infinitely many quantization maps",
    "such a parameter - dependent quantization procedure seems well - suited for investigating possible singularity resolutions in quantum gravity .",
    "the affine quantization of canonical coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 was studied in ref .   and reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the position and momentum operators defined on the half - line , @xmath30 and the constants @xmath31 depend on the fiducial vector @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath29 is not self - adjoint on the half - line .",
    "the choice of @xmath24 can be constrained in a way to obtain the canonical commutation rule for the basic variables , @xmath32=1 $ ] , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "let us start with an analysis of the closed friedmann model . for brevity , we set radiation as the content of the universe , @xmath34 .",
    "then the true hamiltonian reads : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the quantization of the kinetic term reads ( cf .",
    "@xmath37 the constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the fiducial vector @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath39 is non - vanishing only for complex fiducial vectors and will be disregarded in what follows .",
    "we note that @xmath40 is an ordinary differential sturm - liouville operator , singular at the end point @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 , if defined on the domain of smooth compactly supported functions , is essentially self - adjoint for @xmath42 , whereas for @xmath43 the deficiency indices of @xmath40 are @xmath44 and thus more self - adjoint extensions exist requiring setting the boundary condition .",
    "we choose the fiducial vector @xmath24 in such a way that @xmath42 in order to comply with essential self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .    given a state @xmath45 ,",
    "coherent states define the so - called phase space representation @xmath46 and the associated phase space probability distribution @xmath47 : @xmath48 having a well - defined quantum hamiltonian , we can study the evolution of the phase space probability distribution : @xmath49 in fig.[figure1 ] we plot the quantum evolution of the phase space probability distribution of the friedmann universe by setting the coherent state @xmath50 as the initial state .",
    "see ref . .",
    "furthermore , the coherent states are used to map quantum operators back to the classical world , where they become semiclassical observables replacing the classical ones in the phase space .",
    "they are called ` lower symbols ' and the lower symbol of @xmath51 is defined as : @xmath52 we require that @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the lower symbol of hamiltonian is shown ( cf . ref .  ) to generate semiclassical dynamics .",
    "the contour - plots of the classical and semiclassical hamiltonians for the friedmann model are presented in fig .",
    "the strongest singularity is exhibited by the anisotropic bianchi i model .",
    "the non - vanishing shear in this model fuels the gravitational collapse to such an extent as to produce diverging trajectories in the phase space @xmath13 .",
    "the physical hamiltonian reads : @xmath55 due to the positive energy density of the fluid , the physical hamiltonian must satisfy @xmath56 , which in the presence of the shear is non - trivial .",
    "the cosmological phase space @xmath13 consists in expanding and collapsing trajectories , which originate and terminate respectively in the singularity @xmath11 and which are separated from each other by the non - physical region , @xmath57 .",
    "affine quantization naturally smooths ( quantum effect ) the positivity constraint so the contracting quantum states become dynamically connected with the expanding ones .",
    "specifically , we implement the positivity constraint in the quantum model by quantizing @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the heaviside function .",
    "we have obtained the respective quantum dynamics generator , @xmath61 , in ref .",
    ". the lower symbol , which encodes semiclassical features of the quantized dynamics , can be computed numerically and its approximation can be given in terms of analytic functions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the classical and the corresponding semiclassical hamiltonians are contour - plotted in fig .",
    "we notice that due to quantization the classically forbidden region @xmath57 becomes semi - classically accessible .",
    "contracting universes close enough to the singularity bend and extend across this region to emerge smoothly in the expanding branch .",
    "the singularity is resolved with a bounce . on the contrary",
    ", it is intuitively understood that the wheeler - dewitt equation can not be successful in dealings with this sort of hard , shear - fuelled singularities .",
    "the generic local behavior of cosmological spacetimes on their approach to the singularity becomes asymptotically , by virtue of the bkl conjecture , identical with the dynamics of bianchi viii / ix models , in which all familiar forms of matter become dynamically negligible . in what follows we study the hamiltonian constraint of the mixmaster universe ( the vacuum bianchi type ix model ) : @xmath64 the first part of @xmath59 describes the energy of the isotropic expansion and the isotropic curvature potential energy , whereas @xmath65 describes the energy of the anisotropic oscillations of the three - geometry .",
    "when the universe approaches the singularity , anisotropic oscillations become very fast with respect to the contraction rate . therefore , in quantum theory , in analogy with molecular physics , one can assume a fixed eigenstate of quantized @xmath65 , and consider the dynamics of @xmath25 in the potential induced by this eigenstate .",
    "this is the so - called born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "note that the energy of oscillations is dynamically significant and can not be neglected . for low eigenstates , it reads @xmath66 .",
    "the semiclassical constraint was derived in ref . and reads : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are constant dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding friedmann - like equation is plotted in fig .",
    "the singularity is resolved with a bounce .",
    "it was shown that when the bo approximation breaks down , then a huge production of anisotropy may take place at the bounce . in order to maintain the proper balance between the anisotropic and isotropic expansion energies ,",
    "this must be accompanied by a vigorous inflationary - like phase of accelerated isotropic expansion .",
    "more details may be found in ref .  .",
    "coherent states prove to be very useful to deal with the singularity problem in the spatially homogenous models .",
    "they are used to define a covariant quantization ( respecting the symmetries of the cosmological phase space ) , which leads to the resolution of singularities .",
    "they provide a fully consistent semiclassical description . presently , in ref .  , we use coherent states to develop the so - called vibronic framework for the quantum theory of the oscillatory models , which extends beyond the regime of validity of the bo approximation .",
