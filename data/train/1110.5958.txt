    "as has been discussed in the first part of this series of two papers ( henceforth referred to as paper i ) , the migdal - kadanoff bond - moving renormalization group transformation recursion procedure and its extensions are very powerful for the study of near - critical properties of various classical lattice systems with globally symmetries @xcite .",
    "however inconveniences can still be found in treating some dual symmetrical systems such as the fractals even if the generalized procedures presented in paper i are used @xcite .    from another point of view , the fractal systems with local symmetries have attracted much attention in the study of phase transition and critical phenomena since the pioneering works by gefen and co - workers @xcite . in the past few decades great effort",
    "has been devoted to the investigation of such typical fractal systems as koch - type curves @xcite , diamond - type hierarchical lattices @xcite , bethe - type lattices @xcite as well as sierpinski carpets and gaskets @xcite .",
    "the method of decimation @xcite , block transformation @xcite and cumulate expansion @xcite are the usual means for scientists to rely on .",
    "yet the applying of bond - moving procedures on these fractals systems is seldom reported .",
    "we noticed the generalized bond - moving transformation recursion procedures presented in paper i can be easily applied to the sierpinski gaskets under a simple alteration . thus resulted in this paper another type of generalization of the remarkable migdal - kadanoff bond - moving renormalization group transformation . in the following sections of this paper we will give in detail the generalizations we have made on these procedures ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) and their predominance in applications ( sec . [ sec3 ] ) respectively by recurring them on the sierpinski gaskets to investigate the critical properties of the spin - continuous gaussian model .",
    "a summary of our conclusion and some further discussions are presented in sec . [ sec4 ] .",
    "]    sierpinski gaskets are a kind of typical infinitely ramified regular fractal lattices that can be easily constructed by a repeated process .",
    "the starting point is usually based on a regular triangular as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sierlatt]a . then connecting each midpoint of the three sides to divide the initial triangular to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 here in this paper ) smaller sub - triangulares , out of which @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) sub - triangulares at the center of the initial triangular",
    "is eliminated ( fig .",
    "[ sierlatt]b ) .",
    "this procedure is then infinitely repeated in the remained smaller sub - triangulares ( fig .",
    "[ sierlatt]c ) iterating to the microscopic length scales .",
    "the fractal dimension of this sierpinski gaskets is then determined by @xmath4    here we can found that the partial structure of the sierpinski gaskets is actually still a triangular .",
    "then we can deduce reversely from this fact that it will be very easy to make the sierpinski gaskets coarse - grained if one proceeds following a very similar renormalization procedure as those we have presented on the triangular lattices in paper i.    basing on these considerations , we present here in the second part of this series of two papers another type of generalized bond - moving recursion procedures that can be used very conveniently on the sierpinski gaskets like fractal lattices .",
    "it proceeds in such a little different way : ( 1 ) selecting a cluster of six lattice sites in a small sub - triangular part of the sierpinski gaskets as a basic unit for recursion ; ( 2 ) moving the to be eliminated bonds connecting the three to be eliminated sites in the selected triplet with a weight of half length bonds to the peripheral bonds . for an example bond @xmath5 in @xmath6 connecting sites 2 and 3",
    "is moved with a half length weight to bonds @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively as is shown in fig.[tra - pro]b ; ( 3 ) rescaling the system and decimating the to be eliminated sites .",
    "thus the lattice is made coarse - grained under enough steps of renormalization .",
    "this procedure can also be proved to be a powerful way bringing with great convenience in particular in the study of spin - continuous systems constructed on the fractal - like lattices .    ]",
    "for comparing and predominance illustrating of the above bond - moving recursion procedures with other means , we study again the critical behavior of the spin - continuous gaussian model constructed on the sierpinski gaskets whose spins can take any real value between @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of finding a given spin between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is assumed to be @xmath12 d\\sigma_{i}$ ] .",
    "this results in the classical gaussian effective hamiltonian with two - body nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the reduced nearest - neighbor interaction with @xmath15 denotes the ferromagnetic systems ; @xmath16 is the gaussian distribution constant ; @xmath17 the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "the summation of the spin is performed between each nearest - neighbor pair @xmath19 .    in order to successfully complete the bond - moving and decimation processes and generalizing the gaussian model on translational invariant lattices to that on the sierpinski gaskets , we assign two types of interactions @xmath20 and @xmath21 for differentiation of spin interaction at different cases as gefen et al did in previous studies @xcite . where the bond noted as @xmath20 separates between two to be eliminated sub - triangulares while @xmath21 borders a non - eliminated one .",
    "for the particular case of gaussian model two types of self - energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 should also be assigned correspondingly but the numerical value of @xmath24 and @xmath16 is actually identical as well as that of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus if a spin has @xmath25 bonds of @xmath21 and @xmath26 bonds of @xmath20 with its nearest - neighbors , the self - energy of it is then given by @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "in the renormalization procedures the to be eliminated bonds are moved with a weight of half length to the peripheral ones resulting a half weight addition to the nearest - neighbor spin interaction but a wholly symmetrical maintaining of the lattice .    ]    as is illustrated in fig.[sl - pro ] , along with the moving of the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) between the spins @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the self - energy @xmath32 $ ] ( or correspondingly @xmath33 $ ] ) move in the same direction .",
    "the decimation procedure for the renormalized bond @xmath34 is @xmath35ds_{1 } \\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1.0cm}=c\\textrm{exp}\\left[k's'_{a}s'_{b}-\\frac{b}{2}\\left(s'^{2}_{a}+s'^{2}_{b}\\right)\\right ] \\label{decimation}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by directly integrating @xmath36 to decimate the intermediate spins it becomes @xmath37 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1.0cm}=c\\textrm{exp}\\left[k's'_{a}s'_{b}-\\frac{b}{2}\\left(s'^{2}_{a}+s'^{2}_{b}\\right)\\right ] \\label{decimation}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the continuity of spin sampling , the spins are rescaled by @xmath38 with @xmath39 then the recursion relation for @xmath34 is obtained to be @xmath40 meanwhile , the renormalization group transformation of the cell decimated to the renormalized bond @xmath41 is @xmath42ds_{1}\\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1.0cm}=c\\textrm{exp}\\left[\\frac{3k_{e}^{2}}{4b_{e}}s_{a}s_{b}-\\frac{3(2b_{e}^{2}-k_{e}^{2})}{8b_{e}}\\left(s^{2}_{a}+s^{2}_{b}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1.0cm}=c\\textrm{exp}\\left[k'_{e}s'_{a}s'_{b}-\\frac{b_{e}}{2}\\left(s'^{2}_{a}+s'^{2}_{b}\\right)\\right ] \\label{decimation},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which the recursion relation for @xmath43 is derived to be @xmath44    from these recursion relations we can found the critical behavior of the gaussian model on the sierpinski gaskets is quite different from that on the translational invariant lattices .",
    "here we can obtain an attractive fixed point @xmath45 and two critical points @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "an fixed point @xmath48 was found to be repulsive corresponding to the critical point of the gaussian model on the translational invariant lattices given @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    since the integration of the partition function are kept limited because of the introduction of self - energies",
    ", we can obtain the renormalization - group transformation matrix at @xmath46 as @xmath51 by setting @xmath52 at critical point @xmath46 .",
    "clearly we can found that it has only two eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus we obtain the critical exponent of correlation length as @xmath55 in good conformity with the previous results @xcite .    in the meantime",
    ", the renormalization - group transformation matrix at @xmath47 is found to be @xmath56 by setting @xmath57 .",
    "it has also two eigenvalues @xmath58 and @xmath59 resulting in the correlation length critical exponent @xmath60 conforming to the previous results .",
    "in summary , in this second part of the series of two papers we have generalized the migdal - kadanoff bond - moving renormalization group transformation recursion procedures to containing symmetrical single bond operations that can be used conveniently in particular on the fractal lattices .",
    "the critical behavior of the classical spin - continuous gaussian model constructed on the sierpinski gaskets was studied as an example of the application of these procedures .",
    "results obtained are in good conformity with previous studies revealing the dependability of these means",
    ". the predominance of these procedures revealed in this paper may encourage many future applications of them on some more complicated spin systems such as the @xmath61 models .",
