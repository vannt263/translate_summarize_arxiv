    "a powerful and complete characterization of the different three dimensional interacting topological insulators is in terms of a gapped symmetry preserving surface with intrinsic topological order .",
    "the physical symmetries are realized in this surface topological order in a manner which can not be realized in strict two dimensions .",
    "the surface topological order of the topological paramagnets was studied in refs .",
    "the simplest such surface states have @xmath3 topological order , with two particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 having a mutual @xmath69-statistics .",
    "the topological paramagnet i supports a surface theory in which both @xmath8 and @xmath9 particles are kramers bosons ( denoted as @xmath7 ) , while topological paramagnet ii has a surface in which both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are non - kramers fermions ( @xmath12 ) . the third state , being a composite of the previous two , has @xmath8 and @xmath9 both being kramers fermions ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the topological band insulator can also be characterized in terms of its surface topological order .",
    "in contrast to the topological paramagnets the surface topological order in this case is non - abelian and such states have recently been studied in ref . .",

    "[ rootsto ] we list the representative surface topological orders of the three root states described in the main text .    in hindsight , in interacting electron systems the descendants of neutral boson spt states are naturally expected to arise .",
    "however , one could also have naively included the descendants of boson spt states made out of cooper pairs ( charge-@xmath72 objects ) .",
    "the non - trivial boson spt made out of physical bosons with charge @xmath73 supports a surface theory@xcite in which both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are non - kramers bosons carrying charge @xmath74 ( denoted as @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , since we have physical kramers fermions with charge-@xmath4 in the system ( the electrons ) , we can bind them with the @xmath8 and @xmath9 particles .",
    "this converts them to neutral kramers fermions , which becomes exactly one of the spt surface states ( @xmath70 ) of neutral bosons .",

    "here we provide more details of the argument establishing that electronic topological insulators with @xmath23 and a bosonic monopole can be reduced to bosonic topological paramagnets .",
    "it is convenient to start with a symmetry preserving surface termination that has intrinsic topological order .",
    "such a surface state is characterized by a set of anyons @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a discrete label , and their corresponding braiding and fusion rules .",
    "each anyon will be characterized by a sharply quantized charge @xmath34 under the global @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "let us denote this topological information and symmetry assignments as the initial surface anyon theory : @xmath80 .",
    "a useful theoretical device@xcite is to consider creating a monopole source of an external ( non - dynamical ) magnetic field , and dragging that monopole through the topologically ordered surface at position @xmath81 .",
    "such a monopole insertion event changes the external magnetic flux , @xmath82 , piercing the surface by @xmath83 ( in units where @xmath84 ) .",
    "when the monopole sits close to the under - side of the surface , this extra flux , @xmath85 , is concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath81 .",
    "suppose we take a surface excitation , @xmath86 , with fractional charge @xmath87 , and drag it around a sufficiently large loop that encloses ( nearly all ) the additional magnetic - flux from the monopole insertion .",
    "this process accumulates berry phase @xmath88 because of @xmath86 s fractional charge . however , the total monopole insertion event is a local physical process , and since there are no gapless excitations in the system it can not have non - trivial action on distant events ( clearly if @xmath86 is arbitrarily far from the @xmath81 , it should not be able to discern whether the monopole is infinitesimally above or infinitesimally below the surface ) . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath80 contains quasi - particles @xmath89 with fractional charge , @xmath90 , the monopole insertion event must also create a quasi - particle of type @xmath91 in the surface theory which has mutual statistics @xmath92 .",
    "this mutual statistics then exactly compensates the non - trivial berry phase from encircling the additional flux from the monopole insertion , and ensures that the overall monopole insertion event does not have unphysical non - local consequences .",
    "furthermore , since the bulk monopole is chargeless and bosonic , @xmath91 , is a neutral boson .",
    "we can similarly consider the time - reversed version of this process by inserting an anti - monopole from the vacuum into the bulk .",
    "let us denote by @xmath93 the particle nucleated at the surface .",
    "clearly @xmath91 and @xmath93 are exchanged by @xmath5 , indicating that , like @xmath91 , @xmath93 is a charge - neutral boson .",
    "the mutual statistics of an anyon @xmath86 with @xmath93 is then @xmath94 .",
    "further as the monopole and antimonopole can annihilate each other to give back the ground state @xmath93 must be the antiparticle of @xmath91 .",
    "these mutual statistics indicate that driving a phase transition in which @xmath95 condense will confine all fractionally charged particles .",
    "however , in general it is not guaranteed that the condensation of @xmath96 preserves @xmath55 . to avoid this issue",
    ", we take a detour through an intermediate superconducting phase in which descendants of @xmath95 can be safely condensed while preserving @xmath5 .",
    "this results in a topologically ordered state , @xmath97 , which has the desired structure of a neutral boson theory .",
    "our strategy is to first enter a superconducting phase obtained by condensing the physical cooper pair , @xmath98 , from @xmath80 and then to exit it through a different phase transition to reach the final topological order @xmath97 . in the theory ,",
    "@xmath80 , the cooper pair is local with respect to all nontrivial anyons .",
    "thus its condensation preserves the topological order @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting topologically ordered superconductor is conventionally denoted sc@xmath99 ( see ref . ) to distinguish it from the ordinary non - fractionalized bcs superconductor , sc .",

    "the advantage of this choice of variables is now manifest , as the cooper - pair phase @xmath104 is no longer directly coupled to the neutralized fields @xmath108 .",

    "now consider the particles @xmath121 .",
    "these carry vorticity @xmath122 and are interchanged under time reversal .",
    "these are the relics of a monopole tunneling event in this superconducting state discussed in the main text . due to the coupling of @xmath113 to the dual gauge field , @xmath123",
    ", we may always choose a gauge such that time reversal is implemented as : @xmath124 we may now condense @xmath121 and preserve time reversal symmetry .",
    "the condensation also destroys the superconducting order and produces the desired new topological order @xmath97 .",
    "note that the neutralized particles @xmath108 have no non - trivial mutual statistics with @xmath125 as the phase around the @xmath126 exactly cancels the phase around @xmath91 .",
    "hence they survive in @xmath97 as quasiparticles .",
    "the vortex condensate however quantizes electric charge to be an integer .",
    "in particular the charge @xmath34 bosons obtained by fractionalizing the cooper pair @xmath127 are confined unless @xmath34 is an integer . in effect",
    "the original electrically charged @xmath89 particles are confined to the fractional bosons to produce the neutral @xmath108 particles .",
    "the vortons @xmath113 also survive as particles in @xmath128 but they are electrically neutral .",
    "the detour through the superconductor essentially implements a ` charge - anyon ' separation of the original topological theory @xmath80 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the conceptual utility of superconducting degrees of freedom in implementing ` spin - charge ' separation in @xmath76 insulators@xcite . though we will not elaborate this here an alternately route from @xmath80 to @xmath97",
    "is through a parton construction where we fractionalize the charged anyons into a charged boson and a neutral anyon .",
    "this proves that @xmath97 only has integer charged quasi - particles . without loss of generality",
    ", we may relabel the quasi - particle content of @xmath97 by binding an appropriate number of electrons to each quasi - particle to remove the remaining integer charge .",
    "the resulting theory has quasi - particle content @xmath129 , that can be decomposed into the direct product of a neutral boson sector @xmath130 trivially accompanied by a gapped electron .",
    "this completes the desired proof that the @xmath131 classification reduces to the classification of neutral bosonic phases .",
    "in this section we provide a general argument against the possibility of fermionic monopoles in a purely electronic spt insulator .",
    "we will show that fermionic monopoles in the bulk necessarily leads to inconsistencies in the boundary theory , as long as the charge @xmath1 symmetry is preserved . when the charge @xmath1 is gauged , apart from monopoles we may also consider in the bulk dyons parametrized by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the electric charge and @xmath65 the magnetic charge .",
    "if the neutral monopole @xmath134 is fermionic in a purely electronic system ( where the @xmath135 particle is identified with the electron ) all dyons with @xmath136 are also fermions . if time reversal is broken in the bulk the @xmath25 value may change from @xmath137 leading to these dyons acquiring non - zero charge .",
    "however their statistics stays fermionic .",
    "it follows that if any putative time reversal symmetric electronic topological insulator phase with a fermionic monopole exists then it will stay a non - trivial topological insulator even in the absence of time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus it suffices to show that fermionic monopoles are forbidden in the absence of time reversal symmetry to rule out such putative topological insulators .",
    "we will show that spt states of electrons with a global @xmath1 symmetry admit unphysical boundary excitations if the monopole is fermionic .",
    "suppose we could construct a state with fermionic monopoles . by the arguments of the previous section",
    ", we may describe this phase in terms of the surface topological order with particle content : @xmath138 here , @xmath139 is the surface excitation corresponding to the bulk monopole , and hence is a neutral fermion having mutual statistics @xmath140 , with particles @xmath89 of charge @xmath90 .",
    "( even if time reversal is not present we imagine tuning to a point where the monopole is neutral ) .    following an analogous line of reasoning in appendix .",
    "[ s3 ] , we can now pair condense the remnant of the fermionic monopole @xmath141 , which immediately confines all the fractionally charged particles @xmath89 unless @xmath142 for some integer @xmath22 , due to their mutual statistics with @xmath139 . by attaching enough physical electrons ( @xmath38 ) , we can always take the charge of the particles @xmath89 to be either @xmath137 or @xmath143 .",
    "the resulting theory can thus be written as : @xmath144 where @xmath145 have charge @xmath143 , and @xmath146 are neutral quasi - particles .",
    "note that @xmath139 is local with respect to @xmath146 and is a mutual semion with @xmath145 .",
    "the neutral sector of the theory @xmath147 is closed under fusion and braiding due to charge conservation .",
    "moreover they form a consistent topological field theory . to see this ,",
    "let us momentarily dispense also with charge - conservation symmetry ( for example by explicitly breaking it ) , and then condense @xmath148 , which confines all 1/2-charged particles @xmath145 while keeping all the neutral particles @xmath146 unaffected .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath139 is local with respect to all the @xmath146 s , the theory @xmath147 can be viewed as a topological field theory of a system with physical fermion @xmath139 in the _ absence _ of any symmetry .",
    "such a theory can then be confined to @xmath149 without obstruction .",
    "returning to the original theory in eqn [ tqftfm ] this implies that we may get rid of the neutral particles @xmath146 and be left with @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a subset of the original charge-@xmath143 particles @xmath152 .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can restrict our attention to a single species of fractional charge particle @xmath153 , and its anti - particle .",
    "the only possible fusion outcomes consistent with charge conservation are : @xmath154 .",
    "if two copies of @xmath153 fuse to @xmath38 then @xmath155 is the anti - particle of @xmath153 .",
    "however , this is not possible , since the topological spin ( self - statistics ) of @xmath155 and @xmath153 differs by @xmath156 , whereas anti - particles must have the same topological spin . a similar argument rules out the possibility that two copies of @xmath153 fuses to @xmath157 .",
    "this line of reasoning shows that the topological order of eq .",
    "[ eq : inconsistent ] is internally inconsistent , unless there are no @xmath158 particles , i.e. unless the topological order contains only the following particles : @xmath159 since @xmath139 has trivial mutual statistics with @xmath38 , it must be a physical object that is microscopically present in the system ( i.e. is not an emergent particle ) . however , there is no such neutral fermion degree of freedom in an electronic system .",
    "it follows that in a purely electronic system the monopole can not be fermionic in an spt phase with global @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we note that the bose - fermi example constructed in the main paper has a neutral fermion excitation ( a bound state of the boson and fermion ) and hence is allowed to have a fermionic monopole .",
    "let us examine this more closely .",
    "we put the electron into a trivial band insulator , and the boson into a boson topological insulator .",
    "then the charge - neutral external monopole source becomes a fermion@xcite .",
    "we initially consider such a system in a geometry with no boundaries .",
    "we then tune the boson charge gap to infinity , so that the charged bosons disappear from the spectrum , and we are left with a purely electronic theory .",
    "but since the fermionic monopole does not carry any boson charge , it survives as the only charge - neutral monopole .",
    "now the bulk theory is exactly what we were looking for , but we need to examine its boundary and see if it is consistent with a time - reversal invariant electronic system .",
    "as the electrons are in a trivial insulator they do not contribute anything special on the boundary , so we only have to worry about surface states of the @xmath75 boson spt .",
    "we first consider a symmetric surface state with topological order .",
    "it is known@xcite that one of the possible surface states of the bosonic ti is described by a @xmath3 gauge theory with both @xmath8 and @xmath9 carrying charge-@xmath14 and the @xmath160 fermion being charge - neutral ( the state denoted @xmath75 in ref . ) . by setting the boson charge - gap to infinity ,",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 particles disappear from the spectrum , but the neutral @xmath160 fermion survives as a gauge - invariant local object , which is not allowed in a system purely made of charged fermions .",
    "another way to see the inconsistency of the surface is to look at the surface state without topological order in which time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the boson topological insulator leads to a surface electrical quantum hall conductance @xmath161 and thermal hall conductance @xmath162.@xcite the difference of @xmath163 between the two time - reversal broken states should correspond to an electronic state in two dimensions without topological order .",
    "here we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 , which can not be realized from a purely electronic system without topological order . indeed adding integer quantum hall states of electrons",
    "increases @xmath166 by the same amount .",
    "it is possible to add a neutral boson integer quantum hall state without topological order but that requires @xmath167 .",
    "hence the boundary as a purely electronic theory is not consistent with time - reversal symmetry , and the bulk theory can not be realized in strict three dimensions , although it may be realizable at the surface of a four dimensional system .",
    "we also note that if we allow topological ( or other exotic long range entanglement ) in the bulk then the monopole may be fermionic .",
    "in this section , we provide a physical construction of the @xmath7 topological order from the @xmath11 majorana - cone surface state of a time - reversal invariant topological superconductor phase .",
    "we start from the free theory @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and with time reversal acting on the real ( majorana ) fermions as @xmath171    we can group the theory into four complex ( dirac ) fermions by writing @xmath172 the lagrangian then simply describes four gapless dirac cones @xmath173 in which time - reversal acts as @xmath174    it is easy to see that the theory is protected from gap - opening at the free ( quadratic ) level .",
    "we can then ask , could a non - perturbative gap be opened when interaction is introduced ?",
    "the way to tackle this problem is to first introduce a symmetry - breaking mass term into the fermion theory , viewing the mass term as an fluctuating order parameter , and ask if one can recover the symmetry by disordering the phase of the mass field .    for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to first introduce an auxiliary global @xmath1 symmetry @xmath175 as a microscopic symmetry in the model ( rather than a subgroup of the emergent @xmath176 flavor symmetry ) .",
    "this auxiliary symmetry will be removed at the end of the argument , so the final result does not depend on the existence of this @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the total symmetry is now enlarged to @xmath177 , with @xmath178 ( i.e. the conserved quantity associated with the auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry changes sign under @xmath5 like a component of spin rather than an electrical charge ) .",
    "one can now write down a pairing - gap term into the theory @xmath179 which breaks both @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( @xmath180 under time - reversal because @xmath181 on physical fermions ) . the task for us now is then to disorder the field @xmath182 and restore time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the virtue of the auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry shows up here : the field @xmath182 is @xmath183-like , so to disorder it we can follow the familiar and well - understood route of proliferating vortices of the order parameter    it is important here to notice that although the gap in eq .",
    "breaks both @xmath1 and @xmath5 , it does preserve a time - reversal - like subgroup generated by @xmath184 . since we want to restore @xmath5 by disordering @xmath182 ( which surely will restore @xmath1 ) , we must do it while preserving @xmath185 . this  modified time - reversal \" looks almost like the original one , but there is a crucial difference : @xmath186 when acting on the fermion field @xmath187 .",
    "now we are ready to disorder the field @xmath182 . at first glance",
    "it seems sufficient just to proliferate the fundamental vortex ( @xmath188-vortex ) and obtain a trivial gapped insulator .",
    "however , as we will see below , @xmath189 on these fundamental vortices , hence proliferating them could not restore time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the vortex here is subtle because of the fermion zero - modes associated with it .",
    "it is well - known that a superconducting dirac cone gives a majorana zero - mode in the vortex core@xcite .",
    "so the four dirac cones in total gives two complex fermion zero - modes @xmath190 .",
    "we then define different vortex operators as @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the state with all the negative - energy levels filled in a vortex background .",
    "the @xmath1 being spin - like under @xmath5 ( hence @xmath185 also ) means that a vortex configuration is time - reversal invariant .",
    "the only non - trivial action of @xmath185 is thus on the zero - modes : @xmath193 and by choosing a proper phase definition : @xmath194 it then follows straightforwardly that @xmath195 and @xmath196 form two `` kramers '' pairs under @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , since the two pairs carry opposite fermion parity , they actually see each other as mutual semions .",
    "we thus conclude that to preserve the symmetry , the  minimal \" construction is to proliferate double vortices .",
    "the resulting insulating state has @xmath3 topological order @xmath197 with the @xmath8 being the remnant of @xmath195 , @xmath9 being the remnant of @xmath196 , and @xmath160 is the neutralized fermion @xmath198 .",
    "now the full @xmath177 is restored , we can ask how are they implemented on @xmath197 .",
    "obviously these particles are charge - neutral , so the question is then about the implementation of @xmath5 alone .",
    "however , since the particles are neutral the extra auxiliary @xmath1 rotation in @xmath185 is irrelevant and they transform identically under @xmath185 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence we have @xmath199 on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath200 on @xmath160 , which is exactly the topological order @xmath7 .",
    "the charged physical fermion @xmath187 is now trivially gapped and plays no role in the topological theory , one can thus introduce explicit pairing to break the auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "since topological order stems from the charge - neutral sector , pair - condensation of @xmath187 does not alter the topological order , and the resulting state is just the @xmath7 state with only @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "we first provide the proof that a @xmath24 electromagnetic response in a time reversal invariant insulator implies that the charge carriers are kramers fermions .",
    "when the global @xmath1 symmetry is gauged , @xmath24 implies that the monopoles of the resulting @xmath1 gauge field are ` dyons ' ( in the witten sense ) with electric charge shifted from integer by @xmath201 .",
    "label particles by @xmath202 , where @xmath65 is the magnetic charge ( monopole strength ) and @xmath133 is the electric charge .",
    "a strength-@xmath4 monopole ( dyon ) carries charge-@xmath14 , labeled as @xmath203 , which under time - reversal transforms to the @xmath204 dyon , since electric charge is even while magnetic charge is odd under time - reversal .",
    "introduce fields @xmath205 for dyons with magnetic charge @xmath65 and electric charge @xmath133 . under time reversal",
    "these transform as @xmath206 where @xmath207 denotes the corresponding dyon operator .",
    "we then have for @xmath208 @xmath209 the exact value of the phase factor @xmath210 is not meaningful since it is not gauge - invariant ( see appendix . [ s1 ] ) .",
    "now let s consider the bound state of @xmath211 and @xmath212 , it has @xmath213 and @xmath214 , which is nothing but the fundamental charge of the system .",
    "these two dyons see each other as an effective monopole .",
    "to see this view the @xmath204 dyon as the bound state of the electric charge @xmath135 and @xmath215 which is the anti - particle of @xmath203 .",
    "the berry phase seen by the @xmath204 dyon is the same as that seen by a charge from a monopole .",
    "hence their bound state will carry half - integer orbital angular momentum and fermionic statistics the angular momentum of the gauge field@xcite in this bound state is given by @xmath216    the half integer angular momentum goes hand in hand with fermi statistics of the bound state . to determine whether or not the fermion is a kramers doublet , we need to consider contributions from the internal and orbital degrees of freedom separately .",
    "the internal contribution follows readily from eq .  , which contributes to @xmath208 by @xmath217 .",
    "the orbital part contributes to @xmath218 by @xmath156 due to the half - integer angular momentum .",
    "more precisely , since time - reversal exchanges the two dyons , it is generated by a @xmath69-rotation along a great circle , hence @xmath208 is generated by a @xmath219-rotation along a great circle , which picks up a berry phase of @xmath69 due to the mutual - monopole structure of the two dyons .",
    "therefore we conclude that the fundamental charge must be a kramers fermion , and there s no fermion spt with @xmath61 made out of non - kramers fermions .",
    "we emphasize that this argument is non - perturbative , and does not rely on results from free fermion theories .    in the absence of the @xmath24 ti for non - kramers fermions ( @xmath220 )",
    "what are the possible tis ?",

    "<S> our strategy - which sidesteps the difficulties of this prior approach - is to first constrain the symmetries and statistics of monopole sources of external electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we then incorporate these constraints into a theory of the surface , and determine the resulting allowed distinct states .    </S>",
    "<S> in general it is natural to attempt to construct possible spt phases of fermion system by first forming bosons as composites out of the fermions and putting the bosons in a bosonic spt state . </S>",

    "<S> we determine that the distinct such states ( see appendix . </S>",
    "<S> [ s2 ] ) can all be viewed as topological paramagnets as described above .    </S>",
    "<S> while such spin - spt phases can clearly exist , we give very general arguments that the only other electronic root state is the original topological band insulator .    </S>",

    "<S> * generalities * : for any fully gapped insulator in 3d , the effective lagrangian for an external electromagnetic field obtained by integrating out all the matter fields will take the form @xmath15 the first term is the usual maxwell term and the second is the ` theta ' term : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the external electric and magnetic fields respectively .    under time reversal , @xmath19 and in a fermionic system </S>",
    "<S> the physics is periodic under @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> time reversal symmetric insulators thus have @xmath21 with @xmath22 an integer . </S>",
    "<S> trivial time - reversal symmetric insulators have @xmath23 while free fermion topological insulators have @xmath24@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any new interacting ti that also has @xmath24 can be combined with the usual one to produce a ti with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it suffices to restrict attention to the possibility of new tis which have @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the symmetry properties of monopole sources of the external magnetic field . at a non - zero @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> this elementary monopole carries electric charge @xmath26 so that it is neutral when @xmath23 . under time reversal </S>",
    "<S> the monopole becomes an anti - monopole as the magnetic field is odd . </S>",
    "<S> formally if we gauge the global @xmath1 symmetry to introduce a dynamical monopole field @xmath9 it must transform under time reversal as @xmath27 however@xcite ( see appendix . </S>",
    "<S> [ s1 ] ) by combining with a gauge transformation we can set the phase @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> physically this is because the time reversed partner of a monopole lives in a different topological sector with opposite magnetic charge and hence is not simply a kramers partner .    </S>",
    "<S> this fixes the symmetry properties of the bulk monopole . </S>",
    "<S> there are still in principle two distinct choices corresponding to the statistics of the monopole : it may be either bosonic or fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider them in turn below . </S>",
    "<S> bosonic monopoles will be shown to allow for the topological paramagnets mentioned above and nothing else . </S>",
    "<S> fermionic monopoles will be shown to not occur in electronic spt phases .    * topological insulators at @xmath29 - bosonic monopoles : * consider the surface of any insulator with @xmath23 and a bosonic monopole . </S>",
    "<S> this is conveniently incorporated into an effective theory of the surface formulated in terms of degrees of freedom natural when the surface is superconducting , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e _ , it spontaneously breaks the global @xmath1 but not time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the suitable degrees of freedom then are @xmath30 vortices and ( neutralized ) bogoliubov quasiparticles@xcite ( spinons ) which have mutual semion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in general we can also allow for co - existing topological order , i.e. other fractionalized quasi - particles , in the surface superconductor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a dual description of @xmath31 electronic systems that is particularly convenient to studying not just the superconducting phase but also some topologically ordered insulating phases .    </S>",
    "<S> imagine tunneling a monopole from the vacuum to the system bulk . since the monopole is trivial in both regions , the tunneling event - which leaves a @xmath32 vortex on the surface - also carries no non - trivial quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> hence the surface dual effective field theory has a bosonic @xmath32-vortex that carries no non - trivial quantum number </S>",
    "<S> . we can therefore proliferate ( condense ) the @xmath32-vortex on the surface which disorders the superconductor and yields an insulator with the full symmetry @xmath33 unbroken . </S>",
    "<S> however as is well known from dual vortex descriptions@xcite of spin - charge separation in @xmath31 , the resulting state has intrinsic topological order .    in this surface </S>",
    "<S> topologically - ordered symmetry - preserving insulator , a quasi - particle of charge-@xmath34 sees the @xmath32-vortex as a @xmath35 flux . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath32-vortex condensate confines all particles with fractional charge and quantizes the charge to @xmath36 for all the remaining particles in the theory ( for a more detailed discussion see appendix . </S>",
    "<S> [ s3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can always remove integer charge from a particle without changing its topological sector by binding physical electrons . </S>",
    "<S> hence the particle content of the surface topological order is @xmath37 , where only the physical electron @xmath38 in the theory is charged , and all the non - trivial fractional quasi - particles in @xmath39 are neutral . </S>",
    "<S> since time - reversal operation preserves the @xmath1 charge , its action has to be closed within the neutral sector @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore describe the surface topological order as a purely charge - neutral quantum spin liquid with topological order @xmath39 , supplemented by the presence of a trivial electron band insulator , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , any gauge - invariant local operator made out of the topological theory must be neutral ( up to binding electrons ) , but in an electron system a local neutral object has to be bosonic . </S>",
    "<S> hence the theory should be viewed as emerging purely from a neutral boson system . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the bulk spt order should also be attributed to the neutral boson ( spin ) sector , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e _ it should be a spt of spins in a mott insulating phase of the electrons ( a topological paramagnet ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spt states of neutral bosons with time - reversal symmetry are classified@xcite by @xmath41 , with two fundamental root non - trivial phases . </S>",
    "<S> these can both be understood as mott insulators in topological paramagnet phases . </S>",
    "<S> adding to this the usual @xmath24 ti captured by band theory we have 3 root states corresponding to a @xmath0 classification . to establish that there are no other states we need to still consider the other possibility left open for the bulk response : a fermionic monopole .    * topological insulators at @xmath29 - fermionic monopoles ? * : the possibility that the monopole may be fermionic in a system which also has fermionic charges is naively consistent with time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however we can show that such a state can not occur in any electronic @xmath2 spt phase . </S>",
    "<S> crucial to our argument is the requirement of ` edgability ' defined in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> any theory that can occur in strictly @xmath42-dimensions ( as opposed to the surface of an spt in @xmath43 dimensions ) must admit a physical edge to the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that electronic systems with a fermionic monopole are not edgable .    to illustrate the difficulty consider a bose - fermi mixture , with both the boson @xmath44 and the electron @xmath38 carrying charge-@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> now put the electron into a trivial band insulator , and the boson into a bosonic spt state . </S>",
    "<S> then the charge - neutral external monopole source becomes a fermion@xcite . we may attempt to get rid of the bosons in the bulk by taking their charge gap to infinity ( _ i.e _ projecting them out of the hilbert space ) . </S>",
    "<S> however they will make their presence felt at the boundary and the theory is not edgable as a purely electronic system . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we show in appendix . </S>",
    "<S> [ s4 ] by a direct and general argument that fermionic statistics of the monopole in an spt phase implies the existence of physical charge-@xmath4 bosons at the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this is not possible in a purely electronic system . </S>",
    "<S> * physical characterization of interacting topological insulators * : we now describe phenomena which in principle can be used to completely experimentally identify the various tis . </S>",
    "<S> we consider breaking symmetry at the surface to obtain states with no intrinsic topological order . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized in table.[root ] . </S>",
    "<S> a different , less practical , but conceptually powerful characterization is in terms of a gapped topologically ordered surface state which we describe in appendix . [ </S>",
    "<S> s2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> first consider surface states breaking time - reversal symmetry ( and no intrinsic topological order ) . </S>",
    "<S> of the 8 insulating phases we obtained , four have electromagnetic response @xmath24 ( of which one is the topological band insulator ) and four have @xmath23 ( of which one is the trivial insulator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 term in the response means that such a surface state will have quantized electrical hall conductivity @xmath45 with @xmath46 , where @xmath22 can be any integer signifying conventional integer quantum hall effect on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> a further distinction is obtained by considering the thermal hall effect @xmath47 in this surface state . in general in a quantum hall state @xmath48 where @xmath49 are boltzmann s constant and the temperature respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath50 is a universal property of the quantum hall state .    </S>",
    "<S> two of the @xmath24 insulators have @xmath51 ( including the topological band insulator ) while the other two have @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly two of the @xmath23 insulators ( including the trivial one ) have @xmath53 while the other two have @xmath54@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a combined measurement of electrical and thermal hall transport when @xmath55 is broken at the surface can provide a very useful practical ( albeit partial ) characterization of these distinct topological insulators .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider surface superconducting states ( again without topological order ) obtained by depositing an @xmath56-wave superconductor on top . </S>",
    "<S> it was noticed in ref . that the surface of the topological paramagnets i and ii become identical to that of a topological superconductor ( see also appendix . </S>",
    "<S> [ s5 ] for a simpler derivation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding free fermion superconductor has @xmath57 gapless majorana cones at the surface protected by time - reversal symmetry . thus inducing superconductivity on the surface of either topological paramagnet i or </S>",
    "<S> ii leads to @xmath58 gapless majorana cones which should be observable through photoemission measurements . taken together with the @xmath59-breaking surface transport </S>",
    "<S> we have a unique fingerprint for each of the 8 tis .    * </S>",
    "<S> other symmetries , kramers fermions , and @xmath60 topological insulators * : as a by - product of our considerations we are able to address a number of other fundamental questions about interacting topological insulators . for the free fermion systems the kramers structure is what allows a topological insulator with @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> what precise role , beyond free fermion band theory , does the kramers structure of the electron play in enabling @xmath24 ? </S>",
    "<S> we show non - perturbatively that any gapped insulator with a @xmath24 response and no intrinsic topological order necessarily has charge carriers that are kramers doublet fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we also use a similar insight to show the necessity of magnetic ordering when the exotic bulk excitations of the topological mott insulator phase of ref . </S>",
    "<S> are confined . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that time reversal breaking electronic systems with global charge @xmath1 symmetry have no interacting topological insulator phase in three dimensions . </S>",
