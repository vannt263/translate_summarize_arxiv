    "@xcite , where the excitation of a plasma oscillations by a short laser pulse was considered , much interest has been devoted to wakefield generation in plasmas . to a large extent",
    "this has been due to the wakefield acceleration concept ( see , e.g. , tajima - dawson , kirsanov-1987,phys - reports , faure - etal , nature - review , martins - etal ) , where the longitudinal field traveling close to the speed of light in vacuum is used as an effective source for particle acceleration . however , the wakefield properties has also been study from a more theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "most studies of wakefield generation has been done for unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "this is justified by the fact that in most experiments @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath2is the plasma frequency  @xmath3 is the unperturbed magnetic field strength , @xmath4 is the unperturbed electron density , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the electron charge and mass respectively . as can be expected , the wakefield properties is not much affected by the magnetic field in this regime .",
    "however , for @xmath7 , and for the exciting source propagating non - parallel to the the external magnetic field , the wakefield is significantly altered by the non - zero @xmath3wadhwani2002,shukla - hybrid , pre1998,yooshii1997 .",
    "in particular , as found by e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , for the em - pulse traveling perpendicular to the magnetic field , the excited mode becomes an extra - ordinary mode , with a significant electromagnetic part , and a non - zero group velocity .    in the present paper we will re -",
    "consider the excitation of the extra - ordinary mode wakefield in a strongly magnetized plasma , allowing for @xmath8 . in this regime",
    "the group - velocity of the wakefield may approach the speed of light in vacuum @xmath9 . in then turns out that the excitation process is significantly altered , as compared to the regime of a more modest value of @xmath3 . from particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations we find that when @xmath3 is increased , the wakefield changes from an approximately monochromatic field at low @xmath10 , to a broadband one at @xmath11 . at the same time",
    "the energy loss rate of the exciting high - frequency ordinary mode is much increased with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "a reduced system of equations is derived , generalizing previous eqs .",
    "@xcite avoiding the division into fast and slow time scales .",
    "the reduced equations are solved numerically , and a good agreement with the full 1d pic simulations is found .",
    "here we will study an ordinary mode propagating parallel to an external magnetic field , @xmath13 . in the absence of the magnetic field",
    ", it is well known that the ponderomotive force due to a short electromagnetic pulse will excite a wakefield of electrostatic oscillations @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the effects due to the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we note that this is more likely to be relevant for experiments in the microwave regime parchamy2005 , rather than the regime of optical lasers .    the 1d particle - in - cell simulation ( lpic++)@xcite is carried out to study the effect of external magnetic field on the wakefield generation in magnetized plasma . the typical simulation geometry is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the exciting electromagnetic ( em ) high - frequency pulse is taken to be an ordinary mode . for all the results presented here the em field amplitude of the ordinary mode driver",
    "is considered as 0.2 ( in dimensionless unit @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the frequency ) , space and time are taken in units of laser wavelength ( @xmath16 ) and one laser cycle @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the 800 nm laser with fwhm duration of 8@xmath18 and an initially gaussian shape propagates through the plasma along the @xmath19-direction with electric field along @xmath20 and the laser magnetic field along the @xmath21-direction @xcite .",
    "we have modified the code in order to extend its ability to incorporate the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the external magnetic field is taken to be along the @xmath20-direction . the plasma of length 800 @xmath16 is considered with a 40@xmath16 of the ramp region at the front . in the ramp region",

    "@xcite ( see also the discussion and simulation results in ref .",
    "@xcite )    1 .",
    "the ratio of the electromagnetic to electrostatic field field amplitude scales as @xmath10 when @xmath25 is varied .",
    "this is in accordance with the wake field being an extra - ordinary wave mode .",
    "2 .   by observing the position of the drop in the wake field amplitude",
    ", we can deduce that wake field propagates with a group velocity @xmath26 , which is in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite    however , there are also some properties of the pic - simulations that contain new results , as compared to previous findings .    1 .",
    "the wakefield does have a small but nonzero trailing part at a distance more than @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the group velocity of the ordinary mode , and @xmath29 is the time after the entrance of the driving pulse .",
    "the relative energy content of the wakefield in this tail is larger for larger value of @xmath10 .",
    "the approximation that the evolution of the wakefield is slow in a frame moving with the pulse is not entirely accurate .",
    "furthermore , the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite becomes increasingly inadequate when the magnetic field strength is increased such that @xmath8 . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the loss - rate of the driving pulse is approximately independent of @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ loss_pic ] the total energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the em part , contained in the wakefield is plotted as a function of time for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "we see that the loss rate of the driving pulse due to the generated wakefield is approximately constant until @xmath32 , but for larger values of this ratio it increases rapidly .        one way to understand the deviance from the models in ref .",
    "@xcite is to investigate the validity of the basic assumptions .",
    "a key ingredient in the derivation is that the evolution should be slow in a frame moving with the group velocity of the driver .",
    "a consequence of this is that the phase velocity of the wakefield should match the group velocity of the driver .",
    "since the wakefield is dispersive , such a condition determines the dominating frequency and wavenumber to be excited . noting that the plasma is underdense with respect to the driver frequency , the group velocity of the driver is close to @xmath9 , which matches the wakefield phase velocity in case the excited wakefield frequency is @xmath33 and wavenumber @xmath34 .",
    "such a condition can be seen to hold for the leading part of the wakefield , but for a strong static field this part actually makes up for a small part of the energy content of the excited extra - ordinary mode .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fft_ez ] , where the frequency spectrum of the wakefield is computed as a function of the static magnetic field for a fixed position and time of interaction . for @xmath32 we see that the spectrum ceases to peak at @xmath33 , and as a consequence the assumption that the evolution of the wakefield is slow in a system moving with the group velocity can not be accurate . in the rest of the paper the aim is to investigate the physics of wakefield generation in the regime where the basic equations of ref .",
    "@xcite needs to be improved .",
    "for 1d - perturbations ( with variations along @xmath19 ) , the cold relativistic fluid equations can be written .",

    "it was also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the wake - field was also found to have en electromagnetic part , that could be computed from @xmath44 .",
    "the main modification of the wake - field generation due to the static magnetic field @xmath46 was to introduce an electromagnetic component of the wake field , which in turn resulted in a non - zero group velocity .",
    "the pic - simulations of the previous section confirms that these properties are essential ingredients when the external magnetic field is introduced .",
    "however , when the ratio @xmath10 is increased beyond unity , we also saw that additional features were introduced .",
    "in particular , the assumption of ref .",
    "@xcite that the fields evolve slowly in a frame moving with the group velocity , becomes less accurate with increasing value of @xmath47 . in the rest of this section we will derive the coupled equations for an extra - ordinary mode driven by an ordinary mode , without any additional assumptions than those of an 1d geometry and a weak nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , we will avoid making a wkb - ansatz for the high - frequency ordinary mode .",
    "we use the coulomb gauge and write the vector potential as @xmath48 .",
    "thus the component @xmath49 is associated with the electromagnetic component of the nonlinearly driven extra - ordinary mode , and @xmath44 with its electrostatic component .",
    "the fields of the ordinary mode is derived solely from @xmath42 .    from the @xmath20-component of the momentum equation ( [ momentum ] ) we obtain @xmath50which we substitute into ampere s law , to give @xmath51where @xmath52 is the plasma frequency associated with the unperturbed electron density @xmath4 .",

    "we thus conclude that the wakefield generation can be seen as the extra - ordinary mode driven by the ponderomotive force , in agreement with the model ( [ laser - evolution])- ( [ wake-2 ] ) .",
    "however , in contrast to an assumption commonly made in connection with wakefield generation , the evolution is not necessarily slow in a frame moving with the group velocity of the driver . to be more specific - for a low to modest ratio of @xmath80",
    ", the assumption of slow evolution in the co - moving frame is adequate .",
    "however , starting roughly from the value @xmath81 it is not appropriate to consider the evolution as slow , which is reflected by the broad - band nature of the wakefield spectrum ( see fig . [ fft_ez ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that besides abandoning the slow evolution assumption when deriving the eqs .",
    "( [ laser - evolution])- ( [ wake-2 ] ) we have also refrained from the wkb - approximation of the high - frequency driver , that were made in ref . @xcite .",
    "by contrast to the slow evolution assumption , the validity of the wkb - approximation for the driver does not depend only on the ratio of @xmath10 . instead the parameter @xmath82",
    "@xmath83(where @xmath84 is the pulse length , and @xmath85 the high frequency wavenumber ) naturally plays a major role . in fig .",
    "[ fft_ez ] we see that the wakefield frequency spectrum extends almost a factor 6 above the value @xmath33 . for efficient wakefield generation",

    "the parameters used in our case , @xmath89 , lies somewhere in the intermediate range , and therefore we have taken the safe approach and avoided the wkb - approximation for the high - frequency driver , although it should clearly be applicable for a sufficiently large value of @xmath90 , even for the highest values of @xmath10 that has been considered in our paper .     in presence of external magnetic field with ratio @xmath91 0.5 ( a )",

    "in the present paper we have re - considered 1d wakefield generation in magnetized plasmas . based on 1d pic simulations we have deduced that previous results need to be modified in the regime of large magnetic fields . for moderate magnetic field strengths previous results",
    "are confirmed , and the wakefield consists of an extra - ordinary wave mode with a dominating frequency @xmath92 and wavenumber @xmath34 .",
    "however , monitoring the dependence as a function of the frequency ratio @xmath10 , we find that there is a gradual transition in the regime @xmath93 where the wakefield spectrum of the extra - ordinary mode becomes broadband , and the loss rate of the high - frequency driver is enhanced ..    although we have deduced that wakefield generation is governed by eqs .",
    "( laser - evolution)- ( [ wake-2 ] ) , we have not so far discussed why the assumption of a slow evolution in the co - moving frame must be abandoned for a large value of @xmath10 .",
    "however , an explanation of this can be given in the form of a _ reductio ad absurdum _ reasoning .",
    "let us assume that evolution of the extra - ordinary mode is indeed slow in the co - moving frame . in that case , there must be a dominant wavenumber of the wakefield corresponding to the property @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the group velocity of the high - frequency driving pulse and @xmath96 is the phase velocity of the wakefield .",
    "however , from the dispersion relation of the extra - ordinary mode we find that the group velocity for this wavenumber scales according to @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "this behavior is to a large extent reflected in figs [ wf_ex_pic ] , [ wf_ez_pic ] and [ fft_ez ] , where the dominant mode follows the driver closely for the stronger values of the magnetic field . on the other hand",
    "provided the wakefield should follow the driver closely ( as it must when @xmath97 ) and then drop in amplitude suddenly , it can not be well represented by a small spectrum surrounding a leading wave - number .",
    "hence we must have broad - band wakefield spectrum for strong magnetic fields , in which case the assumption of a slow evolution of the wakefield will cease to be adequate .    to some extent",
    "the break - down of the slow evolution of the wakefield is related to the initial conditions .",
    "after long interaction times the system may gradually set up a wakefield with a dominating wave number , and at the same time the slow evolution regime can be approached .",
    "however , the stronger the magnetic field is , the longer time this will take . for a limited size of the plasma region and a strong magnetic field , in practice the slow evolution regime will never be reached .",
    "a practical consequence of this is that the loss rate of the high - frequency driver will be much enhanced , due to the excitation of the broad - band spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the energy loss will be accompanied by a frequency decrease and  a de - acceleration of the driver @xcite .",
    "so far only the basic consequences of a strong magnetic field has been explored .",
    "a more complete study , e.g. involving the effects of varying the self - nonlinearity and the long - time evolution , is a project for further study .",
