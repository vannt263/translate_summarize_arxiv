    "in nuclear reactions with weakly - bound projectiles , breakup processes are significant not only for their prominent cross sections as a final reaction product but also for their influences on other reaction channels such as elastic scattering .",
    "the breakup processes have been investigated originally for the reactions involving weakly - bound stable nuclei , such as deuterons @xcite and @xmath0li @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "interests on the breakup reactions have explosively increased because of the discovery of the halo nuclei around the neutron drip - line and the studies of their reactions @xcite .",
    "a variety of theories have been developed to describe the breakup processes . in this article",
    ", we consider reactions in which the weakly - bound projectile is described as a composite two - body system and the whole reaction is described as a three - body problem of the projectile and the target . at sufficiently high incident energies , one may assume that the projectile internal motion is much slower than the projectile - target relative motion .",
    "then , the projectile internal motion may be frozen during the reaction .",
    "this is the adiabatic approximation , which has been developed originally for the deuteron reactions @xcite .",
    "one may also adopt the eikonal approximation for the fast projectile - target relative motion .",
    "a combined use of the eikonal and adiabatic approximations has provided especially useful descriptions for the reactions of halo nuclei @xcite .    for a more accurate description ,",
    "a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the breakup processes has been developed in a coupled channel framework .",
    "this is known as the coupled discretized continuum channels ( cdcc ) method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the continuum excited states of the projectile are incorporated by discretizing the momentum variables .",
    "the cdcc method has been successful in describing the reactions of deuterons @xcite and @xmath0li @xcite , and has been recently applied to the reactions of halo nuclei @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we discuss an alternative , fully quantum mechanical method : the method of absorbing boundary condition ( abc ) .",
    "this method was developed in the field of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is an introduction of the absorbing potential outside the physically relevant area .",
    "this absorbing potential allows us to treat scattering problems with the vanishing boundary condition .",
    "we show that the abc method provides a useful description for the breakup reactions in which the final scattering channels include three - body continuum states .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section ii , we illustrate the abc method in the simplest example , a two - body scattering problem with a nuclear optical potential . in section iii , we formulate the abc method for three - body scattering problems . in section iv",
    ", we present results of the abc method applied to the breakup reaction of @xmath1ni at the incident deuteron energy of 80 mev .",
    "the results are then compared with those by the cdcc method .",
    "the summary is given in section v.",
    "we first explain the abc method considering the simplest example : the scattering of a particle of mass @xmath2 from a potential @xmath3 .",
    "we separate the potential @xmath3 into two parts , @xmath4 the potential @xmath5 is spherical and may be of long - range .",
    "we assume that it is easy to construct the scattering solution @xmath6 for the potential @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath7 may not be spherical but must be of short - range , @xmath8 for the spatial region beyond a certain radius @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the scattering wave function can be written in a form @xmath11 the function @xmath12 is expressed by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the green s functions with the potentials @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the kinetic energy operator .",
    "a positive infinitesimal number @xmath18 specifies the outgoing - wave boundary condition .",
    "for the special case of @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath6 becomes a plane wave and we have an analytic expression for @xmath21 .",
    "now , let us explain the abc method to construct the wave function @xmath12 .",
    "the basic trick is that the positive infinitesimal number @xmath18 is replaced by a finite , space - dependent function @xmath22 . in order to simulate the outgoing boundary condition",
    ", we introduce the function @xmath22 which is positive and finite in the spatial region , @xmath23 .",
    "we impose the vanishing boundary condition at @xmath24 for @xmath12 .",
    "if the absorbing potential works ideally , only the outgoing waves are allowed in the spatial region around @xmath25 .",
    "if we regard @xmath22 as a part of the hamiltonian , namely @xmath26 , one may regard this replacement as an addition of the absorbing potential , @xmath27 , to the hamiltonian , @xmath28 .    employing the absorbing potential @xmath22 ,",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ scateq ] ) for @xmath12 as the following linear inhomogeneous equation , @xmath29 where , as mentioned above , the scattered wave @xmath12 should satisfy the vanishing boundary condition at @xmath30 .",
    "the right hand side of this equation is spatially localized since we assume that the potential @xmath7 vanishes in the spatial region @xmath31 .",
    "the abc approach thus allows us to obtain the scattered wave function in the spatial region of @xmath32 by imposing the vanishing boundary condition at @xmath30 .",
    "we should note that no asymptotic form is required to solve the scattering problem in this procedure .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath33 can be obtained from the wave function in the spatial region where the potential @xmath7 exists , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scattering amplitude with the potential @xmath5 and @xmath36 is the incoming - wave solution in the potential @xmath5 with the incident momentum @xmath37 ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "here , the wave functions are normalized as @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "the accuracy of the calculated solution depends on the quality of the absorbing potential .",
    "one should choose the function @xmath22 carefully to make the reflected waves as small as possible .",
    "in this respect , the absorbing potential with linear dependence on the coordinate has been tested extensively @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the potential as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath9 , and @xmath44 are positive constants , representing the strength , radius , and thickness of the absorbing potential , respectively",
    ". the absorbing potential should be sufficiently strong to absorb all the outgoing waves , and should be smooth enough to avoid the occurrence of the significant reflected waves .",
    "these conditions could be fulfilled if we employ a large enough value for @xmath44 .",
    "the large @xmath44 , however , implies the necessity of treating a large spatial area , which in turn results in the increase of the computational task . in practice ,",
    "the following condition derived in the wkb approximation , gives a criterion for a good absorber @xcite : @xmath45 the left inequality of eq .",
    "( [ wcond ] ) originates from the condition that the absorption is strong enough to suppress any reflection at @xmath30 , while the right inequality originates from the condition that the reflection at @xmath46 is sufficiently small .",
    "lower the bombarding energy @xmath47 becomes , the wider @xmath44 is required to fulfill the condition of eq .",
    "( [ wcond ] ) .",
    "this is due to the increase of the de - broglie wave length at low energies .    in order to demonstrate the quality of the abc calculation , we consider , as an example , the elastic scattering of @xmath48o + @xmath49c at @xmath50 = 139.2 mev with the optical potential of ref .",
    "the potential @xmath3 is spherical and composed of the real and imaginary parts of the nuclear potential and of the coulomb potential whose short range part is regularized with a quadratic function ( the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere ) .",
    "although one can easily obtain the numerical solution for the potential @xmath3 , we divide the potential into two parts , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in order to test the abc . here",

    "the closed circles represent the absolute values of the @xmath58 matrices which are obtained by a standard numerical procedure to integrate the radial schrdinger equation up to @xmath60 = 30 fm .",
    "one can see that the abc method works quite well in describing the potential scattering .",
    "it should be noted that only the absorbing potential with @xmath43 = 200 mev satisfies the condition of eq .",
    "( [ wcond ] ) .    in fig .",

    ", it does not affect the absolute values of the elastic scattering @xmath58 matrix elements as we saw above .",
    "this implies that the reaction cross section is not so sensitive to the choice of the absorbing potential .        however , when evaluating the differential cross sections , one has to be careful on the choice of the absorbing potential .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the argand diagram of the elastic scattering @xmath58 matrix elements @xmath65 , and the differential cross sections @xmath66 .",
    "the elastic scattering cross sections in the rutherford ratio vary by a few orders of magnitude as a function of the scattering angle .",

    "[ fig5 ]  ( b ) shows the elastic scattering differential cross section in rutherford ratio .",
    "the differential cross section calculated with the folding potential is also shown .",
    "the difference between the abc ( cdcc ) calculations and the folding potential calculation shows the effect of the breakup process on the elastic scattering .",
    "the results clearly show that the abc method gives almost the same results as the cdcc results .",
    "therefore , the abc method can describe the influence of the breakup processes on the elastic scattering angular distribution .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to show the usefulness of the abc method to describe nuclear breakup reactions .",
    "the basic trick in the method is to place an absorbing potential in the outer spatial region where complex three - body reactions do not take place .",
    "the vanishing boundary condition is imposed outside the absorbing potential . if the absorbing potential works properly ,",
    "there exist only the outgoing waves at the edge of the interacting region where the absorbing potential is absent .",
    "we can thus obtain scattering solution by solving the schrdinger - like equation with a source term , without imposing the scattering boundary condition .    in practical calculations ,",
    "the equation is solved in the partial wave expansion , and the radial equation is discretized employing a uniform grid .",
    "the problem is then converted into the linear algebraic equation of large dimension with a complex , sparse , coefficient matrix .",
    "we can efficiently solve the equation by employing the bi - conjugate - gradient method with a pre - conditioning procedure .    to show the feasibility and the accuracy of the abc method , we have applied the method to the @xmath195-@xmath196ni scattering as an example .",
    "for this scattering , detailed analyses with the cdcc method are available .",
    "we have found an excellent agreement between the results by the two methods , the abc and the cdcc methods , for both breakup and elastic scattering . from this observation , we are confident that the physical contents of these two methods are the same , although the procedures in solving the three - body scattering problem look very different .",
    "let us compare the advantages and the limitations between the two methods .",
    "one of the superior features of the abc method is that it is easy to assess convergence of the calculated results . if we fix the radial grid points and the number of partial waves for the @xmath70-@xmath69 motion , the quality of the absorbing potential determines accuracy of the results .",
    "one can easily ascertain the reliability by examining how sensitive the results are to changes of the absorbing potential .",
    "the convergence check is more difficult in the cdcc method in which one must first prepare the discretized continuum wave functions .",
    "one must examine the delicate convergence as to the discretization of the continuum ; the number of the momentum bins and the maximum momentum to be incorporated .",
    "the principal drawback of the abc method is its heavy computational cost .",
    "one must solve a linear algebraic equation of large dimension . in the present example of deuteron reaction , one must solve the equation of @xmath249 dimension for each angular momentum . for this problem ,",
    "the computational time for each angular momentum is typically 20 minutes in a single alpha-21264 processor .",
    "this time multiplied by the number of angular momentum states gives the total computational time for the reaction at a fixed incident energy .",
    "of course , the parallel computation would reduce the computational wall - time , by paralleling different angular momentum calculations .    in general ,",
    "as the incident energy gets higher , the calculation becomes more demanding .",
    "this is because the finer grid spacing is required as the incident energy becomes higher . also the number of angular momentum states that take part in the reaction increases . for reactions with heavy target nuclei , the coulomb breakup reactions are significant , in particular when the projectile is bound extremely weak , such as the halo nuclei",
    ". the description of such coulomb breakup reactions will be a difficult problem for the abc method , because the coupling potential is so long - ranged that one should employ a large critical radius @xmath9 to obtain reliable results .",
    "we must place the absorbing potential at a large radial distance , and must employ a large number of grid points .",
    "these difficulties are , however , not inherent in the abc method , but are suffered by the other methods as well .    establishing the usefulness of the abc approach for breakup reactions of a weakly bound projectile",
    ", we are now planning to apply the method to reactions of unstable nuclei . a preliminary result on the nuclear breakup reactions of a single neutron halo nucleus , @xmath250be ,",
    "will be published in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that calculation ,",
    "the number of the matrix size is about @xmath251 , not so much different from that in the deuteron reaction",
    ". the abc method should , at least , be useful for breakup reactions of a single nucleon halo nucleus induced by the nuclear force .",
    "applicability of the abc method depends on the availability of the computational facilities .",
    "we expect that the abc method will be more popular and useful as the parallel computation becomes more prevalent .",
    "the abc method is also useful in any circumstances where the scattering boundary condition comes in .",
