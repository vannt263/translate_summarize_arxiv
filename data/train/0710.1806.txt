    "complex vanadium oxides often present attractive examples of low - dimensional magnetic systems and exhibit unusual phenomena like spin gap formation or a spin liquid ground state.@xcite these phenomena are not fully understood yet , therefore the search and investigation of novel compounds revealing low - dimensional spin systems is still a challenging task for solid state physics",
    ". basically , there are two possible ways to search for new spin systems .",
    "the first way deals with the study of new structural types that are completely different from those of well - known and thoroughly investigated compounds .",
    "the second way suggests a systematic investigation of a number of related compounds .",
    "both ways have been successfully realized during the last decade.@xcite however , the search for new structural types requires substantial intuition and luck .",
    "systematic studies are more predictable if one can understand the relationship between the composition , crystal structure of the solid and the magnetic interactions in it .",
    "( color online ) the projection of the pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  crystal structure along the @xmath6 axis ( upper panel ) and the system of coupled two - leg spin ladders ( lower panel ) . in the upper panel circles",
    "denote the mixed pb / cd position , white arrows show three different nearest - neighbor exchange interactions . in the lower panel",
    "solid lines correspond to the legs of the ladders , dashed lines show the rungs and dots indicate inter - ladder coupling .",
    "the inter - layer hopping @xmath7 is not shown . ]",
    "mv@xmath2o@xmath3 compounds ( m is an alkaline or alkaline - earth metal ) are promising candidates for a systematic study of magnetic interactions in vanadium oxides . all of them ( except for that with m = cs ) have layered structures with layers formed by edge- and corner - sharing vo@xmath3 square pyramids ( see fig .  [ structure ] ) .",
    "the m cations are situated between the layers .",
    "if m is a monovalent cation the average oxidation state of vanadium is + 4.5 and both charge ordered ( liv@xmath2o@xmath3 ) or disordered ( nav@xmath2o@xmath3 above 35 k ) states may be realized along with 1d magnetic behavior.@xcite actually , the properties of nav@xmath2o@xmath3 are even more complicated since different patterns of charge ordering have been recently found for this compound at low temperature.@xcite    the physics of mv@xmath2o@xmath3 compounds with divalent m cations ( ca , mg ) is simpler due to the absence of charge degrees of freedom . in both oxides vanadium atoms",
    "are tetravalent and a system of coupled @xmath4 two - leg spin ladders is realized . however , exchange interactions in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 and mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 are quite different . in cav@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "the strongest interaction runs along the rung of the ladder ( @xmath8 k , see fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) while other interactions ( @xmath9 ) do not exceed 100 ",
    "150 k.@xcite thus , weakly coupled spin dimers are formed and cav@xmath2o@xmath3 reveals a spin gap @xmath10 [ experimental values of @xmath11 range from 560 to 660 k ( refs . ) ] .",
    "in contrast , mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 reveals comparable nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath12 of about 100 k.@xcite the presence of a spin gap in mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 is still argued and the suggested values of @xmath11 are quite small ( @xmath13 k).@xcite the change of v  o  v angles has been claimed in ref .   as the main reason for the differences between cav@xmath2o@xmath3 and mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "a general phase diagram for the coupled @xmath4 two - leg spin ladders is rather complicated revealing unusual ground states ( namely , spiral order ) and a number of quantum critical points.@xcite however , most of the regions of this diagram still lack experimental study . the remarkable difference between the magnetic properties of cav@xmath2o@xmath3 and mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 suggests that an appropriate substitution in the m cation position of mv@xmath2o@xmath3 enables to modify the spin system and to shift between different regions of the phase diagram .",
    "here we present the results of synthesis and investigation of pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3   an example of mv@xmath2o@xmath3-type compounds combining two different cations in the m position .",
    "the joint experimental and computational study of pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  allows us to carry out a comparison between several mv@xmath2o@xmath3-type compounds and to establish correlations between the cation size , geometrical parameters and exchange integrals .",
    "a powder sample of pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  was obtained by heating a mixture of pb@xmath2v@xmath2o@xmath14 , cdo , v@xmath2o@xmath15 and v@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ratio 2:4:1:1 ) in an evacuated and sealed silica tube at 700@xmath16c for 24 hours . a change in the pb",
    ": cd ratio always resulted in the appearence of trace amounts of impurity phases in the samples .",
    "a change of heating conditions also led to the formation of impurities .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction ( xpd ) data for the structure refinement were collected on a stoe diffractometer ( transmission mode , cuk@xmath17-radiation , ge - monochromator , linear - psd ) .",
    "the jana2000 program @xcite was used for rietveld refinement .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( electron diffraction ( ed ) and edxs ) was performed using a philips cm20 microscope with an oxford instruments inca edxs analyser .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer in the range between 2 and 400 k at fields @xmath18 of 0.01 , 0.2 and 1 t.    scalar relativistic band - structure calculations were performed using the full - potential non - orthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis scheme@xcite and the parametrization of perdew and wang for the exchange and correlation potential.@xcite v@xmath19 , pb@xmath20 , cd@xmath21 and o@xmath22 states , respectively , were chosen as the basis set .",
    "all lower - lying states were treated as core states .",
    "the inclusion of v@xmath23 , pb@xmath24 and cd@xmath25 states in the basis set was necessary to account for non - negligible core - core overlaps due to the relatively large extension of the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the o @xmath26 and pb @xmath27 states were taken into account to get a more complete basis set . a @xmath28 mesh of 768 points in the brillouin zone ( 189 in the irreducible part ) was used .",
    "the spatial extension of the basis orbitals , controlled by a confining potential@xcite @xmath29 , was optimized to minimize the total energy . convergence with respect to the @xmath28 mesh was carefully checked .",
    "a four - band tight - binding ( tb ) model was fitted to the resulting band structure to find the values of the relevant hopping parameters .",
    "the latter values were used to estimate the exchange integrals .",
    "pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  has an orthorhombic unit cell with lattice parameters @xmath30 a , @xmath31 a , @xmath32 a. single crystals of pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  can not be obtained since above 700@xmath16c the compound gradually decomposes without melting .",
    "therefore , the xpd data were used for the structural study .",
    "the lattice parameters for pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  and cav@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath33 a , @xmath34 a , @xmath35 a , space group @xmath36 @xcite ) are rather close , therefore we used the crystal structure of cav@xmath2o@xmath3 as an initial model for the rietveld refinement .",
    "indexing of xpd and ed ( see below ) patterns revealed only the reflection conditions @xmath37 indicating two possible space groups : @xmath36 and @xmath38 , a subgroup of @xmath36 .",
    "the lead and cadmium atoms were placed into @xmath39 position ( corresponding to calcium in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 ) and occupancy factors @xmath40 were set .",
    "the values in table [ exchange ] are easily understood if one considers the change of the crystal structure caused by the decrease of the cation size . in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 calcium ( ionic radius @xmath41 a ) has eight - fold coordination and the [ v@xmath2o@xmath3 ] layers are flat .",
    "smaller cations like magnesium ( @xmath43 a ) require a decrease of the coordination number ( six in case of mg ) that is achieved by the corrugation of the layers ( see fig .  [ layers ] ) .",
    "edge - sharing connections of the square pyramids are rigid in contrast to corner - sharing ones , therefore the corrugation of the layers results in a significant change of the v  o(3)v angle .",
    "the averaged ionic radius of the effective pb@xmath0cd@xmath1  cation ( 1.33  a ) is even larger than that of calcium and the layers remain flat . for that reason ,",
    "angles remain almost constant but v  v distances ( and hence v  o distances ) increase .",
    "( color online ) comparison of the mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 ( upper panel ) and cav@xmath2o@xmath3 ( lower panel ) structures .",
    "the small size of the mg cation results in a corrugation of the [ v@xmath2o@xmath3 ] layers . ]",
    "now we turn to the exchange integrals . according to ref .   the dramatic decrease of @xmath44 in mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 compared to that in cav@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "is caused by the decrease of the angle . in case of pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  the decrease of @xmath44",
    "is less pronounced since interatomic distances are changed instead of the angle .",
    "this result is quite reasonable as magnetic interactions are known to be far more sensitive to the variation of angles than to interatomic distances .",
    "the values of @xmath45 are more difficult to explain .",
    "the relevant bonding angles in the two compounds are quite similar . the v ",
    "v distance in mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 and pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  is higher than in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 but @xmath46(pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 ) .",
    "one may suggest two reasons for such changes of @xmath45 .",
    "first , tight - binding model reveals significant next - nearest - neighbor diagonal  interaction ( @xmath47 k ) in pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  while lower estimates ( @xmath48 k ) were given for cav@xmath2o@xmath3 and mgv@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite this explanation seems to be reasonable ( at least qualitatively ) since lead and cadmium have different relevant orbitals compared to calcium or magnesium .",
    "therefore , pb and cd may mediate superexchange interactions better .",
    "note however that we discuss antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange integrals only ( see band structure section ) , and ferromagnetic contributions may slightly change the situation .",
    "second , the consideration of the geometrical parameters corresponding to v  o  v path only may be an oversimplification as other factors ( e.g.  local environment of vanadium : all the v  o distances and o  v  o angles ) are also important .",
    "thus , in case of complex superexchange paths it is difficult to impose a simple correlation between exchange integrals and geometrical parameters as the spin system in the mv@xmath2o@xmath3-type compounds is rather complicated .",
    "nevertheless , we succeed in the explanation of the basic difference between pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  and cav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we found that the cav@xmath2o@xmath3 structure is conserved rather well and the increase of the effective cation size in pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  results in a mere increase of interatomic distances . both @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are decreased and the type of the spin system ( weakly coupled dimers ) remains unchanged .",
    "the corrugation of the [ v@xmath2o@xmath3 ] layer ( alike the one that happens in mgv@xmath2o@xmath3 ) would be necessary to induce a really significant change of the spin system .",
    "the layers in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 are almost flat and the further increase of the cation size can not give rise to their distortion .",
    "it means that one has to introduce a smaller ( namely , smaller than calcium ) cation between the [ v@xmath2o@xmath3 ] layers in order to achieve an appreciable change of the spin system .",
    "the number of the appropriate cations is rather limited , therefore one may try to use a pair of different cations instead .",
    "the present study demonstrates that even two cations with fairly different size may randomly accommodate interstices between the vanadium - oxygen layers .",
    "this approach seems to be very promising for the search of new layered vanadium oxides since combinations of two different cations provide an easy way to adjust the cation size and modify the spin system in a controlled manner .    in conclusion , we prepared and investigated the complex vanadium oxide pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "its crystal structure is similar to that of cav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the new compound reveals a system of weakly antiferromagnetically coupled dimers with an intradimer interaction of about 270 k. in our approach using microscopic model with averaged hopping parameters we were able to describe the influence of structural changes on the magnetic interactions .",
    "nearest - neighbor exchange interactions in the [ v@xmath2o@xmath3 ] layers are decreased with the increase of the interatomic distances from cav@xmath2o@xmath3 to pb@xmath0cd@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  while the type of spin system remains unchanged .",
