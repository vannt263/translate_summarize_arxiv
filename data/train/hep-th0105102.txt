    "superembedding is an elegant and geometrically profound approach which is based on a supersymmetric extension of the classical surface theory to the description of superbrane dynamics by means of embedding worldvolume supersurfaces into target superspaces ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) .",
    "the superembedding approach arose as a proposal to solve the problem of the covariant quantization of the green  schwarz superstring by combining in a more general formulation main properties of both the neveu ",
    "ramond ( nsr ) and the green  schwarz ( gs ) formulation , and by now it has developed into a generic geometrical method for formulating the theory of superbranes .    being manifestly doubly supersymmetric ( on the worldvolume and in target superspace ) the superembedding approach has explained the origin and the nature of the fermionic @xmath0symmetry of the gs formulation as a manifestation of the conventional local supersymmetry of the worldvolume , and thus solved the problem of infinite reducibility of the @xmath0symmetry by realizing it as an irreducible extended worldvolume supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "this stimulated progress in the covariant quantization of the green  schwarz superstring mainly due to persistent work of n.  berkovits @xcite .    the superembedding approach established or clarified a classical relationship between various formulations of the dynamics of superparticles and superstrings , such as the nsr and the gs formulation @xcite , the twistor @xcite and harmonic @xcite descriptions .",
    "this approach has proved to be a universal and powerful method applicable to the description of all known supersymmetric branes , in particular , to those of them for which standard methods encountered problems because of their specific structure , such as the 5brane of m  theory .",
    "the superembedding methods allowed , for the first time , to derive the complete set of covariant equations of motion of the m5brane @xcite . and",
    "only later these equations were obtained @xcite from the m5brane action @xcite based on a different technique adapted to deal with self  dual fields .",
    "the superembedding formulation has also proved to be useful for studying the `` brany '' mechanism of partial supersymmetry breaking @xcite by giving a geometrical recipe @xcite for constructing covariant worldvolume supersymmetric actions for superbranes . upon gauge fixing worldvolume superdiffeomorphisms these actions become those of effective field theories with non  linearly realized spontaneously broken supersymmetries .",
    "this has demonstrated an intrinsic link of the superembedding approach and the method of nonlinear realizations developed in application to supersymmetric theories in @xcite ( see @xcite for a review and references ) .    in this contribution",
    "i would like to make an introduction into the superembedding formalism and describe its basic properties .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction the superembedding description of superbrane dynamics is formulated in such a way that it possesses manifest supersymmetry on the brane worldvolume and in target superspace , and thus has properties of both the nsr and the gs formulation .      in the nsr formulation , which describes spinning particles @xcite and spinning strings  @xcite ,",
    "the worldline or worldsheet of the spinning object is a supersurface @xmath1 parametrized by bosonic coordinates @xmath2 and fermionic coordinates @xmath3 which we will collectively call @xmath4 . depending on the model considered @xmath1 may have a various number of fermionic directions @xmath3 . for simplicity",
    "we here take only one @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of the spinning object is described by embedding @xmath1 into a bosonic target space ",
    "time @xmath5 parametrized by coordinates @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . in the classical problems",
    "the number of space ",
    "time dimensions can be arbitrary , but for quantum consistency the spinning string , whose worldsheet has one or two fermionic directions , must live in a ten  dimensional target space .",
    "the motion of the spinning object is described by the image of @xmath1 in @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is associated with the bosonic degrees of freedom of the spinning particle or string in @xmath5 , and the grassmann ",
    "odd vector @xmath11 is associated with its spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the nsr formulation is invariant under worldsheet superdiffeomorphisms @xmath12 , which include @xmath1 bosonic reparametrizations @xmath13 and local worldsheet supersymmetry",
    "@xmath14    the presence of the local symmetries ( [ soro-2 ] ) and ( [ soro-3 ] ) implies that the dynamics of the spinning objects is subject to bosonic and fermionic first  class constraints , respectively , which i will _ schematically _ write down in the form @xmath15 the bosonic constraint in ( [ soro-4 ] ) is the mass shell or the virasoro conditions , and the fermionic constraint produces , upon quantization , the dirac equation for the spin wave functions of the dynamical system .",
    "the nsr formulation does not have target  space supersymmetry .",
    "the latter appears , in the case of the spinning string , only at the quantum level upon imposing the gliozzi ",
    "scherk  olive projection .",
    "the merit of this formulation is that it is covariantly quantizable .",
    "this formulation is applicable to all known superparticles , superstrings and superbranes .",
    "now the worldvolume @xmath1 is a ( p+1)dimesnional bosonic surface parametrized by the coordinates @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and the target space , into which @xmath1 is embedded , is a superspace @xmath18 parametrized by bosonic coordinates @xmath19 ( @xmath7 ) and by an appropriate number of fermionic coordinates @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 the gs formulation is manifestly invariant under bosonic @xmath23 reparametrizations @xmath24 , and target space superdiffeomorphisms @xmath25 , which in the case of flat target superspace reduce to the translations along @xmath19 and to the global target ",
    "space supersymmetry transformations @xmath26 there is also another ( non  manifest ) local worldvolume fermionic symmetry , so  called @xmath0symmetry , inherent to the gs formulation .",
    "this is an important symmetry which implies and reflects the existence of supersymmetric bps brane  like solutions of corresponding supergravity theories .",
    "it is thus responsible for the ` brane scan ' ( i.e. which brane lives in which target superspace ) .",
    "the @xmath0symmetry was first observed in the case of superparticles @xcite and has the following generic form of transformations ( in flat target superspace ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a projector matrix ( @xmath29 ) , whose form depends on the object under consideration .    because of the presence of the projector in the @xmath0transformations they are infinite reducible , so only half of @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 of the @xmath32 grassmann spinor components , effectively contribute to the variation of the worldvolume fields .",
    "this is a cause of the problem of the covariant quantization of the gs formulation .    to solve the infinite reducibility problem of the @xmath0symmetry it is natural to try to find its irreducible realization which is covariant in target superspace .",
    "a natural assumption is that this should be an extended local worldvolume supersymmetry ( [ soro-3 ] ) with the number of independent parameters equal to the number of independent ( irreducible ) @xmath0symmetries @xcite .",
    "this reasoning brings us to      in this formulation the dynamics of superbranes is described by embedding a worldvolume _",
    "super_surface @xmath33 parametrized by the coordinates @xmath34 ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath35 into a target _",
    "super_space @xmath18 parametrized by the coordinates @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "note that the number of the grassmann directions of @xmath33 is half the number of the grassmann directions of @xmath18 .",
    "such a choice of the supermanifolds for superembedding is caused by our desire to identify @xmath31 local supersymmetries on @xmath33 with @xmath31 independent @xmath0symmetries of the gs formulation .",
    "thus in the doubly supersymmetric formulation the degrees of freedom of the superbranes are described by worldvolume superfields @xmath39 where @xmath40 stand for the terms of higher order in @xmath41 .",
    "these terms contain auxiliary fields and in addition , for example in the case of the d  branes and the m5brane , include the gauge fields propagating on the worldvolumes of these branes .    from eq .",
    "( [ soro-8 ] ) we see that in the doubly supersymmetric construction the number of degrees of freedom of the superbrane roughly speaking doubles .",
    "we now have @xmath10 describing the bosonic oscillations of the brane , the grassmann ` spin'vectors @xmath42 as in the nsr formulation , the green  schwarz fermionic spinor degrees of freedom @xmath43 and their bosonic counterparts @xmath44 .",
    "so if all these worldvolume fields are independent the corresponding models will not describe conventional superbranes . in this case",
    "one will get , for instance , so called spinning superparticles and spinning superstrings @xcite which have more degrees of freedom then the conventional nsr and gs dynamical systems .",
    "they also have infinite reducible @xmath0symmetry as a fermionic symmetry independent of the local worldvolume supersymmetry .    to reach our goal of interpreting @xmath0symmetry as a manifestation of the local worldvolume supersymmetry we should find an appropriate doubly  supersymmetric description of the _ conventional _ superbranes .",
    "for this we should impose constraints on the superfields ( [ soro-8 ] ) which relate their components in such a way that the independent physical degrees of freedom described by these superfields will correspond to the standard gs formulation .",
    "the geometrical meaning of these constraints is that they cause the worldvolume supersurface @xmath33 to be imbedded into the target superspace @xmath45 in a specific way .",
    "before discussing in more detail the geometrical meaning of the superembedding condition let us consider its dynamical consequences in the simplest case of a superparticle propagating in a flat @xmath46 , @xmath47 target superspace .",
    "then the supersurface @xmath33 of the previous subsection is associated with the superparticle  worldline \" having one bosonic ( time ) and one fermionic coordinate @xmath48 , and the target superspace is parametrized by bosonic three ",
    "vector coordinates @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and grassmann majorana two  spinor coordinates @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "the superembedding condition relates the worldline superfields @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the following way @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a grassmann covariant derivative on @xmath33 which in the case of the superparticles can be chosen to be flat @xmath57 using the @xmath3expansion ( [ soro-8 ] ) which in the case under consideration does not contain the  @xmath40\"terms we obtain the following relation between the components of the superfields @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath58 @xmath59 from eq .",
    "( [ soro-11 ] ) we see that @xmath60 are not independent fields and are expressed in terms of the derivatives of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover in the l.h.s . of ( [ soro-11 ] )",
    "one can recognize the canonical momentum of the superparticle @xmath61 whose square is identically zero @xmath62 because of its so called cartan ",
    "penrose ( or twistor ) representation as a bilinear combination of commuting spinor components and @xmath63matrix identities .",
    "we conclude that the superparticle is massless .",
    "_ in the case of the superstrings the superembedding condition will produce in a similar way the virasoro constraints , and it will produce the corresponding constraints for the other superbranes . _",
    "( [ soro-12 ] ) implies the relation between the grassmann vector and the grassmann spinor variables , so that only one or another can be regarded as describing independent fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a basic relation which allows one to establish a classical correspondence between the nsr and the gs formulation of supersymmetric particles and strings @xcite .",
    "let us now demonstrate how @xmath0symmetry appears in the superembedding formulation as a weird realization of the local worldvolume supersymmetry .    the components ( [ soro-7 ] ) of the superfields @xmath64 and @xmath54 transform under the local worldline supersymmetry ( [ soro-3 ] ) in the standard way @xmath65 @xmath66 we now substitute into the first equation of ( [ soro-15 ] ) the solution ( [ soro-12 ] ) of the superembedding condition ( [ soro-9 ] ) and observe that , due to the form of the @xmath67variation ( [ soro-14 ] ) , the variation of @xmath19 can be rewritten as follows @xmath68    the next step is to replace the grassmann scalar parameter of the local supersymmetry by the scalar product of the spinor @xmath69 with a grassmann spinor parameter @xmath70 , which is always possible , @xmath71 and to substitute ( [ soro-17 ] ) into the @xmath67variation ( [ soro-14 ] ) .",
    "we thus get @xmath72 we now note that , due to the superembedding condition ( [ soro-11 ] ) , the bilinear combination of @xmath73 in ( [ soro-18 ] ) is nothing but @xmath74 which is the projector matrix in the @xmath0symmetry variation of @xmath67 ( [ soro-7 ] ) . hence , the local supersymmetry variations ( [ soro-16 ] ) and ( [ soro-18 ] ) reduce to the @xmath0variations ( [ soro-7 ] ) .",
    "_ we have thus demonstrated how , in virtue of the superembedding condition ( [ soro-9 ] ) , the @xmath0symmetry of the gs formulation of the superbranes shows up from the irreducible local worldvolume supersymmetry .",
    "_    one might have already noticed the difference in sign in the target  space supersymmetry variations of @xmath19 ( [ soro-6 ] ) and in the worldvolume supersymmetry variations ( [ soro-16 ] ) and corresponding @xmath0variations ( [ soro-7 ] ) .",
    "the target  space supersymmetry and the local worldvolume supersymmetry ( or @xmath0symmetry ) can be therefore regarded as , respectively , ` left ' and ` right ' supertranslations of @xmath19 .      to understand the superembedding condition from the geometrical point of view",
    "let us note that the left hand side of ( [ soro-9 ] ) is the grassmann component of the pull ",
    "back onto the superworldline of the target  space vector supervielbein one  form @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 form a basis of the supercovariant one  forms ( supervielbeins ) on the superworldline .",
    "we see that the superembedding condition ( [ soro-9 ] ) requires that the pullback of the target  space _ vector _ supervielbein @xmath79 vanishes along the _ grassmann _ directions of the superworldvolume .",
    "this is the generic requirement for the superembedding to be appropriate to the description of the dynamics of the superbranes .",
    "in general , if we take a supersurface @xmath33 , whose geometry is described by supervielbein one  forms @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , and a curved target superspace @xmath18 , whose geometry is described by supervielbein one ",
    "forms @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath18 should be that of corresponding supergravities , which implies that the torsions and curvatures of @xmath33 and @xmath18 are subject to appropriate supergravity constraints .",
    "] , and consider the embedding of @xmath33 into @xmath18 , then for the superembedding to describe a super  p  brane propagating in @xmath18 the pull  back of @xmath88 along the grassmann directions of @xmath33 must vanish , i.e. in @xmath89 the grassmann components are zero @xmath90 for the most of the superbranes ( with some subtleties for the space filling and codimension one branes @xcite ) , the superembedding condition ( [ soro-22 ] ) , accompanied by the @xmath18 and/or @xmath33 supergravity constraints , implies that    * the geometry of the superworldvolume @xmath33 is induced by its imbedding into @xmath18 , i.e. the @xmath33 supergravity on the brane is not propagative ; * the dynamics of the superbrane is subject to the standard constraints of the green ",
    "schwarz formulation , such as the virasoro constraints and their fermionic counterparts ; * @xmath0symmetry is a particular form of worldvolume superdiffeomorphisms ; * the consistency of the superembedding condition results in the same ` brane scan ' as that of the gs formulation .",
    "in addition , when the number of the grassmann directions of @xmath91 is 16 or higher , the integrability of the superembedding condition requires the worldvolume superfields to satisfy the dynamical equations of motion of the superbrane @xcite .",
    "it is in this way the covariant equations of motion of the m5brane were obtained for the first time @xcite .",
    "in the cases when the superembedding condition does not imply dynamical equations but only the kinematic constraints , one can construct ( doubly supersymmetric ) worldvolume superfield actions for corresponding superbranes .",
    "several related methods have been proposed so far to construct the superembedding actions @xcite .    for the massless",
    "superparticles the action is simply the integral over the superworldline of the product of the left hand side of the superembedding condition ( [ soro-22 ] ) with a lagrange multiplier @xmath92 @xmath93 in the case of the massive superparticles and superbranes to the action ( [ soro-23 ] ) one must add a second term which governs the dynamics of the superbrane and produces both the nambu ",
    "goto ( or dirac  born  infeld ) term and the wess  zumino term of the gs formulation .",
    "let me explain the general structure of this second term with the example of a space filling d3brane in @xmath94 , @xmath95 superspace . in this case , the geometry of the worldvolume @xmath33 is that of chiral @xmath46 , @xmath95 supergravity @xcite .    the d3brane couples to supergravity fields via the worldvolume pull  back of the wess ",
    "zumino four  form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the field strength of the bi gauge field propagating on the d3brane and @xmath98 ( p=0,2,4 ) are ` ramond - ramond ' p  form fields .    to construct the d3brane action as an integral over the chiral @xmath46 , @xmath95 superspace @xmath33 parametrized by @xmath99 @xmath100 we take a component of the pull  back of ( [ soro - wz ] ) onto @xmath33 which has the appropriate dimensionality .",
    "this is @xmath101 .",
    "we then contract @xmath102 with the antisymmetric product of the pauli matrices @xmath103 .",
    "the d3brane action ( accompanied by the superembedding term ( [ soro-23 ] ) ) is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a chiral superspace integration measure ( see @xcite ) .    upon solving for the superembedding condition , integrating over @xmath3 and eliminating auxiliary fields one can get from this simply  looking superembedding action the d3brane action of the gs formulation .",
    "it is still a problem for future study to demonstrate how , in the static gauge , the action ( [ soro - action ] ) is related to the super field dbi action discussed in @xcite .    as a final remark to this section",
    "we note that when the superembedding condition ( [ soro-22 ] ) produces dynamical equations of motion and the worldvolume superfield actions can not be constructed there exist geometrically well  grounded recipes @xcite of how to construct green  schwarz  type actions for corresponding superbranes .",
    "we have tried to describe in simple terms basic features of the superembedding approach , which has not only allowed one to explain and clarify various classical and quantum properties of superstring and superbrane theory , but has also found applications in the construction and description of new superbrane models , and of field theories with partially broken supersymmetry , as well as for solving practical problems .",
    "for instance , recently it has been used for calculating vertex operators in ( m2m5)brane systems @xcite .",
    "one may expect the superembedding methods to be also useful for other purposes , such as a unified ( s  duality ) description of fundamental and solitonic extended objects @xcite , and , in particular , for a covariant description of @xmath106 coincident dp - branes and corresponding supersymmetric non  abelian dirac  born  infeld theories .",
