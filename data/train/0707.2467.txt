    "cyclic covers of the projective line defined over a field @xmath2 of characteristic zero have been thoroughly studied .",

    "the zeros of @xmath6 in a suitable finite extension field of @xmath2 are the branch points of @xmath7 . in the case",
    "that @xmath2 is a @xmath0-adic field , it is known that not every equation as above corresponds to a cover by a mumford curve . and",
    "even if @xmath6 is of the right kind , one finds strong restrictions on the position of the branch points for @xmath7 to be a mumford cover of @xmath8 .",
    "this was first observed in the case @xmath9 and @xmath10 an elliptic curve : @xmath10 is a tate curve , if and only if the four branch points do not form an equilateral quadrangle in @xmath8 . to be more precise , by a projective automorphism",
    "one can take the branch locus to be @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "then for residue characteristic not equal to two , the legendre equation @xmath13 is the equation of a tate curve , if and only if @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a hyperelliptic cover , then the restriction found in @xcite is that the branch points come in pairs of points closer to one another than to the other branch points .",
    "the distance is measured by rational affinoid subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "the most elegant way of obtaining bounds for relative positions of the branch points of any finite galois cover @xmath7 of @xmath8 is through the @xmath1-tree @xmath15 for the discrete finitely generated group @xmath16 giving rise to the orbifold uniformisation of @xmath17 factoring through @xmath7 and having the same branch locus and ramification orders as @xmath7 .",
    "distances within @xmath18 translate into distances between branch points .",
    "the group @xmath16 sits in an exact sequence @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the galois group of @xmath7 and @xmath21 is a free group whose rank is the genus of @xmath10 .",

    "extensive use of the @xmath1-tree is being made in the classification of @xmath0-adic triangle groups @xcite .    in the present article ,",
    "we focus on all possible cyclic covers of @xmath8 with twofold aim .",
    "firstly , we exhibit detailed calculations of the exact bound for @xmath23 characterising the mumford covers among four - point cyclic harbater - mumford covers @xmath7 whose branch locus is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and give the exact sizes of the separating annuli for covers with more branch points .",
    "secondly , explicit hyperbolic generators for @xmath21 are given from which again one can calculate the characteristic bound from above by ford s method of isometric circles and some combinatorial group theory , and thus gains an explicit parametric description of the schottky uniformisation of the mumford curve . for covers of prime degree , we recover the generators of @xcite .",
    "we remark , however , that here we are only dealing with the positions of branch points up to  first order \" , meaning that our methods do not reveal the precise relationship between the discrete representation @xmath24 and the branch points of the corresponding mumford cover @xmath7 , which would require the study of automorphic forms on the mumford curves .",
