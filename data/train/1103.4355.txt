    "coherent state in quantum mechanics usually refers to a specific type of quantum states with minimum uncertainty .",
    "it was first discovered in the context of oscillator field and has found wide applications in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "a quantum harmonic oscillator in coherent state most closely resembles the behavior of a classical oscillator .",
    "the notion was later generalized to spin systems  @xcite . in an ensemble of @xmath0 spin-@xmath3 particles , the term spin coherent state ( or atomic coherent state ) is used to denote the states where the collective spin @xmath4 has the minimum uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "such states can be easily identified in the basis @xmath5 which are eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , and @xmath10 denotes additional quantum numbers to provide a complete set of labels .",
    "the collective spin @xmath11 gets every value from @xmath12 down to @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) in integer steps , and for each collective spin value @xmath11 , the magnetic quantum number @xmath15 .",
    "one can easily show that the minimum uncertainty relation @xmath16 is satisfied for all extremal states @xmath17 in this basis .",
    "hence these states and their rotations generated by @xmath18 are the spin coherent states ( scs )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , two contrary characters coexist on these states : the most classical collective spin behavior ; and the fundamentally non - classical phenomenon of quantum entanglement . for every @xmath19",
    ", there is a degenerate set of @xmath20 with identical collective properties and distinct entanglements where the number of unentangled spins is upper bounded by @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "preparation of scs has been possible only in limited cases .",
    "the @xmath22 scs , nondegenerate and unentangled , is obtained when all spins are fully polarized .",
    "most experimental studies of spin squeezing start on this state .",
    "schemes were also proposed to populate mixed state of singlets ( @xmath23 scs ) by collective pumping  @xcite , and to select out singlet by projective measurement in a scattering model  @xcite . engineering a pure - state scs of an arbitrary @xmath11 value is a challenge but of multi - fold significance .",
    "it is the sufficient condition for initialization into a decoherence free subsystem for robust quantum computation under strong collective decoherence  @xcite .",
    "scs of @xmath24 are resources of large scale entanglement with potential uses in one - way quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the ability to access a scs of entangled spins also opens up a new realm for the study of the interrelation between collective spin behaviors and quantum correlations in a spin ensemble  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose control schemes for engineering pure - state scs of an arbitrarily specified collective spin value in a general spin ensemble .",
    "the schemes are based on incoherent spin pumping of the @xmath0 target spins and a set of ancilla spins by a few ( e.g. three ) collective raising / lowering operators . the desired pure state is obtained with an @xmath0-independent probability by a single projective measurement on the steady state of the pumping , and the success rate approaches @xmath25 with @xmath26 cycles of pump plus measure . in a simplified pumping scenario aimed for maximum entanglement ,",
    "the steady state of @xmath0 pumped spin qubits ( without measurement projection ) realizes the ideal resource for @xmath27 optimal quantum telecloning  @xcite .",
    "we show how the scheme can be implemented in the realistic system of atomic spin qubits trapped in optical lattice , where the collective spin pumping is realized by stokes or anti - stokes light scattering .",
    "error analyses show that high fidelity state engineering is possible for up to @xmath2 atomic spin qubits in the presence of control errors and decoherence .",
    "this is a concrete example of using simple and robust irreversible dynamics to prepare a desired complicated quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the scheme can also prepare resource state for the secret sharing protocol  @xcite , and for efficient construction of large scale aklt state with applications in one - way quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "key to the state engineering approach by irreversible dynamics is to design the dissipative controls under which the system saturates to the desired state vectors .",
    "we utilize here the spin pumping process which drives a spin system towards a mixture of all singlets connected to the initial state by the pumping operators  @xcite .",
    "if a target spin ensemble is in singlet with a spin-@xmath11 ancilla , its collective spin value must also equal to @xmath11 . with a proper constraint from conserved quantum numbers",
    ", the singlet can be unique from which the desired pure - state scs of the target spins can be obtained .",
    "the target spins are divided into two subgroups with collective spin @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , and the collective spin of @xmath30 spin-@xmath14 ancillas is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "when an inhomogeneous collective operator of the form @xmath32 acts on a scs , the final state can be generally written as @xmath33 where the first two quantum numbers in the kets denote the total spin and the @xmath34-component of @xmath35 respectively .",
    "calculation of the coefficients @xmath36 is straightforward by expanding the collective spin states in terms of common eigenstates of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we find that only the @xmath43 transitions are allowed  @xcite , and the ratio between transition rates @xmath44 is @xmath45 consider the incoherent strong pump by @xmath46 which results in a mixture of scs of @xmath47 , and the weak pump by the inhomogeneous operator @xmath48 which then causes transitions between these scs with the effective rate @xmath49 and the selection rule @xmath50 . from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) , we can see the @xmath51 transition is much faster than the @xmath52 one between any such pair of states .",
    "thus , the pump will saturate the target and ancilla spins to singlets of @xmath53 where @xmath54 is minimized . with the target and ancilla",
    "spins initialized on the fully polarized state , the quantum numbers @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are all conserved by the pump operators .",
    "only one singlet exists under this constraint : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes eigenstates of @xmath60 and @xmath61 with eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "[ fig1](a ) presents a simulation of the spin pump using the lindblad master equation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "here we have chosen the inhomogeneous raising operators @xmath66 while other choices of coefficients @xmath67 lead to similar results .",
    "for the simulated example , we set the spin pump rates @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . after a pump time @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 is occupied by a population @xmath72 . for general values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we require @xmath76 which ensures the lowering operator @xmath77 to be applied much more frequently than the raising operator @xmath78 .",
    "the largest possible value of @xmath79 is @xmath80 while the smallest possible value of @xmath81 is @xmath82 .",

    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the probability of not obtaining @xmath71 is reduced to @xmath91 after 30 cycles of measure plus repump .    from the singlet @xmath84 , further pumping by the target spin operator @xmath92 bring the target spins to the desired scs @xmath93 . here the collective spin value @xmath11 of the target spins is controlled by the number of the ancilla spins involved .",
    "different choices of @xmath94 and @xmath95 realize distinct pure scs of the same collective spin value , which are fully symmetric under permutation of spins within subgroup a ( or b ) . a and b can also be initialized with any @xmath96 and @xmath97 by applying the scheme first to the subgroups .",

    "we consider the @xmath23 scenario of the above scheme ( i.e.  no ancilla spins ) which uses two pump operators : the homogeneous @xmath92 and the inhomogeneous @xmath109 , where a and b each contain @xmath110 target spins . for @xmath111",
