    "unlike classical ccd - type detectors which have nonlinearity as a function of photons counts hitting the detector ( i.e. , count - dependent nonlinearity or gain nonlinearity ) , ir hgcdte detectors ( such as the nicmos , hawaii , and hawaii - rg detectors ) have another type of nonlinearity that is not only dependent on the total photon counts , but also dependent on the count - rate or incident flux level . that is , a fainter source hitting the detector with a lower photon rate gives a different nonlinearity response from a brighter source with a higher photon rate even if they give the same total number of counts .",
    "this count - rate dependent nonlinearity , also known as flux - dependent nonlinearity , or  reciprocity failure \" in photography , is relatively well known among engineers working on infrared detectors , but is less well - known among observational astronomers .",
    "it was first discovered in @xmath154 nicmos data @xcite and characterized by @xcite and @xcite , for which a nonlinearity of @xmath116% per decade of flux change was reported for nicmos .",
    "later studies also investigated this effect on newer generation hgcdte ir detectors from teledyne imaging sensors , such as the @xmath154 wfc3 ir detector and the hawaii - rg family detectors @xcite . despite the still - unclear physical mechanism behind the flux - dependent nonlinearity",
    ", studies have found that this effect is common in hgcdte detectors and varies from detector to detector @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the newer generation hawaii - rg series have significantly lower flux - dependent nonlinearity than older generation detectors , and this effect is generally not wavelength - dependent @xcite .",
    "characterizing and calibrating the flux - dependent nonlinearity for hgcdte ir detectors is important for high precision photometric measurements such as measuring transmission spectra or secondary eclipses of exoplanets , as the signatures of interest are often extremely small and dominated by noise or systematics . in principle , because these measurements only target differential flux changes as a function of time , the differential nonlinearity effects are minimal and usually negligible as long as the incident flux and psfs are stable , and the psfs are well sampled by many pixels ( so minor variations can be averaged out ) .",
    "however , because ground - based observations usually suffer from large flux variations from pixel to pixel due to atmospheric variations or time - varying instrumental effects ( e.g. , varying bright spots on the psf due to telescope astigmatism ) , it is necessary to understand the impact of this effect .",
    "we characterized the flux - dependent nonlinearity of the hawaii-2 detector of palomar hale / wirc ( an earlier generation of the hawaii-2rg family ) using dome flats with the detector installed on the telescope . to ensure the stability of the flat lamp , we kept the power of the lamp stable and unchanged , and simulated different incident flux levels by changing the amount of mirror cover opening . at each fixed incident flux level , we took many sets of exposures with increasing exposure times to sample the nonlinearity curve .",
    "we took minimum exposures interspersed between each set of measurements to measure and track the incident flux level of each nonlinearity curve .",
    "this ensures that small flux variations of the flat lamp are properly corrected .",
    "although the absolute flux level can not be measured accurately in this manner due to existing nonlinear counts from the detector , it still allows us to track the relative differential nonlinearity changes at each observed flux level . by sampling the nonlinearity response of the whole detector at different incident flux levels and comparing with the actual counts",
    ", we can construct a nonlinearity response map as a function of observed flux and total counts per pixel  this allows us to correct for the nonlinearity of each pixel based on its measured counts and average flux .",
    "the measured - to - actual counts ratio , i.e. , the nonlinearity response , can be denoted as : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the mean flux of pixel @xmath108 in image @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the total measured counts of pixel @xmath108 in image @xmath157 .",
    "the mean flux of pixel @xmath108 in image @xmath157 can be approximated using its total counts and the exposure time of the image as long as the exposure time is not too long ( e.g. , @xmath159 s ) : @xmath160    since all pixels have the same exposure time in each image , i.e. , @xmath161 , we can take this advantage and convert the response from a function of flux and counts into a function of exposure time and counts . therefore , for fixed exposure time",
    "@xmath162 , as for the case of our secondary eclipse observations , the nonlinearity function can be further simplified to : @xmath163 which is essentially a function of pixel counts @xmath158 when the exposure time is fixed .",

    "the nonlinearity curves are clearly flux - dependent in the figure . given the same number of total counts , high incident flux levels ( short exposures ) cause less deviation from unity than that of low flux levels ( long exposures ) , a trend that is consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the shape of each nonlinearity curve closely resembles each other despite their difference in absolute nonlinearity levels .",
    "all curves have a  ramp \" at low counts ( @xmath2615 k ) and a  plateau \" between @xmath165 k counts and 30 k counts , and start to drop off at @xmath1230 k when the counts are close to saturation .",
    "this suggests that for images with high background levels ( bg ) , such as the @xmath1 band images ( bg@xmath1212 k ) in our observations , most of the pixels are in the  plateau \" region , and thus have negligible differential nonlinearity effects for differential photometry .",
    "in contrast , images in the @xmath0 band have more significant nonlinearity differences between the wings and peaks of each stellar psf due to their low background levels and large differences in counts .",
    "since we only measure differential photometry in our secondary eclipse observations , we can take the advantage of the similar nonlinearity shapes and average them to create a normalized differential nonlinearity curve that is universal to all exposure times .",

    "the resulting global nonlinearity approximation is : @xmath167 assuming all pixels on the detector have the same response , where @xmath168 is the scaled counts of each pixel .",
    "we applied this nonlinearity curve to our wirc data in the @xmath0 band based on the assumption that the detector response remains similar for exposure times lower than 12s .",
    "we then divided each pixel s measured counts by its corresponding nonlinearity approximation in section [ wirc ] .",
    "we also applied this nonlinearity approximation to the @xmath1 band data .",
    "however , the resulting difference in @xmath1 is negligible , as expected from its high background levels .",
    "this global nonlinearity curve is applicable to all wirc data obtained using the same hawaii-2 detector and the same exposure times .",
    "however , since the flux - dependent nonlinearity varies from detector to detector , this function form can not be applied to other instruments .",
    "nonetheless , the measurement method described here can be applied to similar characterizations of hgcdte ir detectors .",
