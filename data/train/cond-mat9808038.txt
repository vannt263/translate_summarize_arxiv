    "deformation of the ground state gives rise to observable effects in the excitation spectrum of these systems , with the splitting of the giant dipole resonance in deformed nuclei most likely being the best well known feature@xcite .",
    "based on the close analogy that exists between the nuclear giant dipole resonance and the cluster surface plasmon , a similar splitting is expected and has indeed been observed in atomic clusters ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite for reviews of experimental and theoretical work ) . a spheroidal deformation ( prolate and oblate )",
    "is often sufficient to explain data in both nuclei and atomic clusters although recent jellium model calculations @xcite also suggest more complicated shapes for the latter .",
    "clemenger @xcite has used a deformed oscillator model , which is inspired by the nilsson model of nuclear physics @xcite , to describe deformed clusters .",
    "however strutinsky @xmath1 @xcite have pointed out that the oscillator potential is somewhat special and argued that a spheroidal cavity would give a more realistic description of the equilibrium mean field ( in nuclei , but the same is true for large atomic clusters ) .",
    "actually the spheroidal cavity is still a rather special choice since its sharp surface is an undesirable feature . a mean field with a diffuse surface would be more realistic .",
    "studies by arvieu @xmath1 @xcite of the classical motion of a particle in a deformed saxon  woods like potential indicate that part of the classical phase space becomes chaotic . in a spheroidal cavity instead",
    "the single - particle motion is integrable and this fact makes calculations practicable .",
    "in this paper we study surface plasmons in deformed clusters by assuming a spheroidal cavity model for the equilibrium mean field .",
    "thus we limit our analysis to the simplest deviation from spherical shape and consider only spheroidal geometry .",
    "however our model is not limited to small deformations and , in principle , we can study systems ranging from spherical to almost cigar or disk - like shapes .",
    "our aim is to extend the semiclassical theory of linear response based on the vlasov equation of refs.@xcite to deformed systems .",
    "this theory can be viewed as a semiclassical version of the random phase approximaton ( rpa ) .",
    "although a fully quantum treatment of the problem is certainly more rigorous , the vlasov equation has the advantage that the numerical effort required is greatly reduced .",
    "indeed , a fully quantum rpa calculation for finite systems must rely heavily on numerical computation .",

    "in spite of its well known difficulties in reproducing the observed width of collective resonances , the rpa is still the basic microscopic theory of small  amplitude vibrations for many fermions systems . the rpa theory can be derived in the green function formalism @xcite . the rpa green function @xmath2 obeys an integral equation that can be written formally as [ 1.1 ] g ( ) = g^0()+g^0()vg ( ) , where the unperturbed particle - hole green function @xmath3 describes the single - particle motion of the constituents in the equilibrium mean field , and @xmath4 is the effective two - body residual interaction .",

    "( [ 1.1 ] ) means facing two main problems : first to evaluate @xmath3 for the system under study and then solving the corresponding integral equation to determine @xmath2 .",
    "the latter becomes quite a challenge when the system is non ",
    "spherical since @xmath2 will be determined by a system of coupled integral equations , as we shall discuss later on .",
    "the problem of calculating @xmath7 for a given mean field is simpler in the semiclassical theory of linear response developed in refs .",
    "this theory has been applied to the study of giant resonances in spherical nuclei @xcite and of surface plasmon excitations in spherical microclusters @xcite . the excitation spectra given by this semiclassical theory",
    "are very similar to those yielded by the fully quantum rpa theory even when the many - body system under investigation is not particularly large .",
    "moreover for large deformations it is expected ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.591 ) that shell effects should be smaller than for spherical systems , thus favouring a semiclassical approach .",

    "however the rpa equation is actually more complicated when exchange ( fock ) terms are properly taken into account @xcite .",

    "<S> a microscopic theory of linear response based on the vlasov equation is extended to systems having spheroidal equilibrium shape . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the linearized vlasov equation , which gives a semiclassical version of the random phase approximation , is studied for electrons moving in a deformed equilibrium mean field . </S>",
    "<S> the deformed field has been approximated by a cavity of spheroidal shape , both prolate and oblate . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to spherical systems , there is now a coupling among excitations of different multipolarity induced by the interaction among constituents . </S>",
    "<S> explicit calculations are performed for the dipole response of deformed clusters of different size . in all cases studied here </S>",
    "<S> the photoabsorption strength for prolate clusters always displays a typical double - peaked structure . for oblate clusters we find that the high  frequency component of the plasmon doublet can get fragmented in the medium size region ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fragmentation is related to the presence of two kinds of three - dimensional electron orbits in oblate cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the possible scaling of our semiclassical equations with the valence electron number and density is investigated .    </S>",
