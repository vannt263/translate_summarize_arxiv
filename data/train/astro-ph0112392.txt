    "in the last several years , the basic model of particle acceleration above a pulsar polar cap ( pc ) has been undergoing significant revision .",
    "sturrock ( 1971 ) , ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) and arons & scharlemann ( 1979 ) originally proposed that particles are accelerated by an induced electric field , producing curvature radiation ( cr ) photons which create electron - positron pairs in the strong magnetic field .",
    "the pairs short out the electric field above a pair - formation front ( pff ) , self - limiting the acceleration . in the process of screening or shorting - out the electric field ,",
    "some fraction of the positrons is accelerated back toward the pcs and heats the surface of the neutron star ( ns ) , producing a potentially observable x - ray emission component ( arons 1981 ) .",
    "two recent developments have introduced important changes to this picture .",
    "first was the finding of muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) that the effect of inertial - frame dragging near the ns surface greatly increases the induced electric field @xmath2 above the pc in space - charge limited flow models ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) .",
    "the second was the realization that inverse - compton radiation of the primary particles can produce pairs which could potentially screen the electric field ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 , harding & muslimov 1998 ; hereafter hm98 ) .",
    "we have investigated the electric field screening and pc heating in the revised space - charge limited flow ( sclf ) model . in the first paper ( harding & muslimov 2001 ; paper i ) , we have presented our results for screening and pc heating by cr pffs , as in arons ( 1981 ) , but using the frame - dragging electric field of muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) .",
    "paper i outlined a self - consistent calculation of the pff height , returning positron flux and the screening scale length , where the @xmath2 and the primary flux are adjusted for the change in charge density caused by the returning positrons .",
    "a main assumption of this calculation was that the screening scale is small compared to the height of the pff , the location where the first pairs are produced .",
    "this turns out to be generally true for screening by cr - produced pairs because the pair cascade multiplicity grows rapidly over small distances due to the strong dependence of cr photon energy on particle energy .",
    "thus , the existence of a cr pff always results in pc heating and full screening of @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the pc heating luminosity , as a fraction of the spin - down luminosity , increases with pulsar characteristic age , @xmath3 , and should be detectable for pulsars with @xmath4 yr .",
    "the most significant heating occurs for pulsars near the death line for cr pair production , which is @xmath5 yr for normal period pulsars and @xmath6 yr for millisecond pulsars .",
    "our predicted x - ray luminosity due to pc heating is about a factor of ten higher than the x - ray luminosity predicted by arons ( 1981 ) , due to the increase in accelerating voltage drop resulting from the inclusion of inertial - frame dragging effects .",
    "we also predicted that older pulsars should have higher pc surface temperatures from heating .    in this second paper ( paper ii ) , we present results of our investigation of electric field screening and pc heating by inverse - compton scattering ( ics ) radiation pffs .",
    "we investigate pc heating by ics produced pairs in all pulsars , including those which produce cr pairs .",
    "for the older pulsars that do not produce pairs through cr , pc heating by positrons from ics cascades is especially important .",
    "our treatment of the ics pffs follows closely that of hm98 , where cyclotron - resonant and non - resonant scattering are considered as separate radiation components .",
    "hm98 found that the ics pffs are located much closer to the ns surface than are the cr pffs , because primaries with lorentz factor of only @xmath7 can produce pairs via ics whereas lorentz factors of at least @xmath8 are required for production of pairs via cr .",
    "they also found that the ics pffs of positrons returning from the upper pff occur at a significant distance above the surface , so it is possible that ics pairs fronts are unstable if screening of @xmath2 at the lower pff occurs .",
    "however , hm98 did not determine whether the ics pairs were capable of screening either at the upper or lower pffs .    this paper will attempt to answer those questions with a calculation similar to that of paper i. in section ii",
    ", we describe the acceleration model for this calculation .",
    "we use a solution for @xmath2 from poisson s equation which imposes an upper boundary condition requiring that @xmath9 at the location of screening ( as in hm98 ) , which differs from that of paper i which used a solution with no upper boundary .",
    "the solution with an upper boundary is more appropriate for screening at ics pffs which form close to the surface , where the screening scale is generally comparable to the pff height .",
    "this solution is required here because pairs from ics photons may screen @xmath2 close to the ns surface . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath2 is suppressed due to proximity of the screening to the surface .",
    "section ii also presents a calculation of ics pff height and the location of a new ics pair death line .",
    "we find that virtually all known pulsars can produce pairs by either resonant ics ( rics ) or non - resonant ics ( nrics ) in a pure dipole field .",
    "hibschmann & arons ( 2001 ) ( hereafter ha01 ) have recently taken a different approach to determining pulsar death - lines including ics produced pairs .",
    "they define the pff as the location where the pair multiplicity achieves that required for complete screening of the @xmath2 , whereas we define the pff as the location where pair production begins ( i.e. where the first pairs are produced ) . in the case of cr , this distinction is minor since the screening scale is small compared to the pff height , but in the case of ics the distinction is very important since the screening scale is comparable to the pff height .",
    "ha01 also assume that the pair multiplicity required for screening is determined by the difference between the actual charge and the goldreich - julian charge at a distance from the ns surface that is roughly equal to the pc radius , whereas in our calculation the charge density required for screening is determined by the charge deficit at the location of creation of pairs which can be much smaller . with their more restrictive definition of the pff ,",
    "their death lines differ significantly from ours . in section iii",
    ", we give self - consistent solutions for the fraction of positrons returning to the pc and for the screening scale .",
    "we also explore the question of whether positrons returning from the upper pff can screen @xmath2 near the lower pff close to the ns surface .",
    "the subject of pulsar pair death lines , i.e. which nss are capable of pair production , will be discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we present our calculations of pc heating luminosity due to returning positrons , giving both numerical and analytic estimates .",
    "summary and conclusions , as well as a comparison of results from both papers i and ii will be given in section vi .",
    "in this paper we exploit the same model for charged particle acceleration that is described in paper i. namely , in the acceleration region we use the appropriate solution for the electric field and potential presented in paper i. for example , for most ics pair fronts , where the screening occurs over the length scale smaller than the pc size , we use our formulae ( a7)-(a10 ) of paper i , whereas in the screening region ( see   3.2 for details ) for all cases we model the electric field by equation ( 26 ) of paper i.        for our analytic estimates we shall use the same simplified expressions for the accelerating electric field ( cf .",

    "also , in all our analytic estimates based on the above formula we shall discriminate between unsaturated and saturated regimes of acceleration , with the unsaturated / saturated regime occuring in the case where the characteristic altitude of pair formation is smaller / larger than the pc radius .",

    "for the @xmath19 and @xmath21 values above the lines in fig . 1 for the different processes , we were able to find numerical solutions to equation ( [ s0 ] ) .",

    "we find that the majority of pulsars can not produce pairs through cr .",
    "this result has been well known for some time ( arons & scharlemann 1979 , arons 1998 , zhang et al .",
    "we find that virtually all known pulsars , with the exception of only a few ms pulsars , are capable of producing pairs via ics .",
    "for the majority of pulsars , those with @xmath52 , the pairs are produced from nrics photons .",
    "we have plotted ics pff boundaries for three different temperatures and , as expected , there is only a small dependence on pc temperature .",
    "the slight variation due to pc temperature occurs for higher field pulsars where scattering is not in the extreme klein - nishina regime and the photon energies become somewhat temperature dependent .",
    "the failure of the lowest - field ms pulsars to produce ics pairs in our calculation may be due to the failure of our @xmath2 solution , obtained in the small - angle approximation , to accurately model the accelerating field in the ms pulsars which have large pcs with @xmath53 ; or to our use of a canonical ns model in the case of ms pulsars which may have undergone significant mass accretion in low - mass binary systems .",
    "we are currently exploring these effects to correct this shortcoming .",
    "also , we shall examine the possibility of photon - photon pair formation in ms pulsars .",
    "we will discuss the broader implication of pair death lines in section 4 .",
    "to estimate the maximum fractional density of positrons returning from the upper pffs we can use equation ( 33 ) of paper i and the expressions for @xmath46 derived in   2.2 .",
    "we must note , however , that in paper i ( where we investigated the cr case alone ) in our analytic calculations of the fraction of returning positrons , we justifiably assumed that the screening occurs within the length scale much less than @xmath46 .",
    "this is not the case for ics , for which the screening scale is determined by the scale of growth of energy of pair - producing photons . for the ics photons the energy of pair - producing photons @xmath54 , so that the scale of growth of @xmath0 governs the screening scale @xmath55 , i.e. _ s ~_z = z_0 \\ {    ll 0.5  z_0 & if pp_^(r , nr ) , + z_0 & if  p > ~p_^(r , nr ) .    .",
    "[ deltas ] thus , in the case of ics the screening effectively occurs over a more extended region .",
    "this means that even within the screening region the primary electrons keep accelerating and generating pair - producing photons .",
    "since the pair - production rate per primary electron in the case of the ics photons is not as high as in the case of cr photons , the assumption that the altitude of the screening is @xmath46 would result in a significant underestimation of the returning positron fraction at the ics - controlled pair - fronts . to come up with better estimates we should add @xmath55 to the calculated values of @xmath46 , or , according to formula ( [ deltas ] ) , multiply @xmath46 by a factor 1.5 and 2 , for the unsaturated and saturated regimes , respectively .",

    "in contrast , in our calculations the fractional density of returning positrons is proportional to the dimensionless screening altitude ( see paper i ) , and can be roughly estimated as @xmath64 z_0 $ ] .",
    "thus , the ratio of our value for the density of returning positrons to that of ha01 is of order of @xmath65 , which for the observed pulsar parameters may range from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "more specifically , for short - period pulsars our calculated fractions of returning positrons are up to a factor of @xmath68 less than those of ha01 , while for relatively long - period pulsars they are larger by about the same factor .",
    "besides this quantitative difference , there is a significant difference in the dependence of our fractional densities on @xmath69 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that in reality , the screening scale and thus also @xmath70 is dependent on the pc temperature , as will be shown in the numerical calculations .",
    "we can not model this dependence analytically since we have assumed that the @xmath55 is a constant multiple of @xmath46 for all pulsars .",
    "our numerical calculation of the returning positron fraction and scale length of the ics pair screening follows that described in paper i for cr pair screening .",
    "as detailed in that paper , we first compute the pair source function in energy and altitude above the pff and then compute the dynamical response of the pairs to the @xmath2 above the pff by solving the continuity and energy equations of the pairs to obtain the charge density .",
    "the @xmath2 above the pff is parameterized as an exponential with scale height @xmath55 , which is readjusted at each iteration to equal a multiple of the height at which the computed charge density from the pairs equals the difference between the primary beam charge density and goldreich - julian charge density . in computing the source function of pairs from ics photons ,",

    "the discrete qed treatment of the synchrotron emission in high magnetic fields ( described above ) is able to treat the effect of pair production in the ground landau state , which also severely limits the number of pair generations in fields @xmath105 ( baring & harding 2001 ) .      since the ics photon spectrum has a much weaker dependence on the particle lorentz factor than the cr photon spectrum , the ics pair source function grows much more slowly with height above the pff . in the case of nrics ,",

    ". in nearly all cases ,",
    "the screening scale lengths are comparable to the particle acceleration length , requiring different treatment of the self - consistent screening calculation from what was used in paper i for cr screening . the onset of pair production and possible screening close to the ns surface couples the entire @xmath2 solution to the screening scale .",
    "we therefore must correct the accelerating @xmath2 as well as the @xmath2 in the screening region above the pff on every iteration of the screening scale length .",

    "[ a7 ] - [ a10 ] of paper i ) to @xmath108 , so that the electric potential distribution below the pair front is accurate .",
    "we still assume the exponential form with scale height @xmath55 ( eq . [ 26 ] of paper i ) for @xmath2 above the pff .",
    "but unlike our calculation of cr pair screening , the location of the pff will change and adjust on every interation of @xmath55 . the exponentional function @xmath109 $ ] describing the @xmath2 above the pff is also renormalized at the pff at each iteration so that the value of @xmath110 is equal to the maximum value of the @xmath2 solution between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we also must take into account the increase in the charge deficit in the screening region , which will also cause ics screening to be more difficult .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of an ics pair source function , integrated over energy , so that the growth of pairs as a function of distance @xmath113 above the pff is displayed .",
    "the first generation pairs ( those produced by primary electrons ) is almost flat before beginning to decrease . including pairs from higher cascade generations produces an initially sharp increase in number of pairs vs. height , but the pair number quickly levels off and also eventually decreases .",
    "the ics pair source function is a sharp contrast to the cr pair source function shown in figure 1 of paper i , which increases nearly exponentially with height above the pff .",
    "this raises the interesting question of whether ics pairs are capable of screening @xmath2 to all altitudes , even if they are able to initially screen the local @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows an example of a self - consistent solution for the charge density @xmath114 due to polarization of pairs and @xmath115 in the screening region .",
    "the charge density initially increases faster than the charge deficit , which is increasing approximately as @xmath116 . in this case ,",
    "screening of @xmath2 is achieved locally , until the pair source function begins to decline with @xmath116 , causing the charge density due to pairs to decrease . as the charge density due to pairs decreases",
    "while the charge deficit is increasing , screening can not be maintained and the @xmath2 will again begin to grow .",
    "we can not model this effect in the present calculation , which would require the solution of poisson s equation throughout the screening region .",
    "however , it is clear that ics screening can not short - out @xmath2 and produce a limit to particle accleration at low altitudes .",
    "ics screening , even if locally complete , will only slow the particle acceleration until the ics pair density falls off and beyond this point the particles will resume their acceleration until they can produce cr pairs , which will then screen the @xmath2 at higher altitudes .    for many pulsars",
    ", however , ics can not even achieve locally complete screening .",
    "figure 4 shows computed boundaries of ics local screening for different assumed pc temperatures , @xmath117 k , as a function of pulsar surface magnetic field and period .",
    "pulsars above and to the left of these boundaries can achieve local screening of @xmath2 at a colatitude of @xmath118 , while pulsars below and to the right of the boundaries can not . although the pff boundaries were nearly independent of @xmath119 , the screening boundaries are very sensitive to the temperature of the soft photons . for low @xmath119 ,",
    "only very high - field pulsars , those whose pairs source functions are dominated by rics , can screen with ics photons . as @xmath119 increases , the boundaries move down , but are limited in their movement to the right as they approach the ics pff boundaries ( figure 1 ) .",
    "there is also some dependence of the screening boundaries on @xmath16 , in that the boundary for a given @xmath119 will be higher at a lower value of @xmath16 .",
    "this means that screening is more difficult in the inner parts of the pc , so that some pulsars may have local ics screening only in the outer part of their pc .",
    "even though complete ics screening is not achieved for all pulsars , there will still be positrons which turn around and return to heat the pc .",
    "in fact this heating can be substantial since in the absence of complete screening which shuts of the acceleration , most of the positrons from ics pairs will return to the pc .",
    "figure 5 shows self - consistent calculations of the returning positron fraction , as well as the pff altitude @xmath46 which we have discussed in section ( 2.2 ) , as a function of @xmath120 . figures 5a and 5b , which have the same @xmath21 and @xmath69 values but temperatures @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively , illustrate that although there is very little difference in the pff altitude with a large increase in pc temperature there is a large increase in returning positron fraction .",
    "the dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath119 is not reflected in the analytic estimates ( eqs . [ [ frac_r ] ] , [ [ frac_nr ] ] ) which are based only on a constant multiple of the charge deficit at the pff altitude , proportional only to @xmath46 .",
    "the size of @xmath123 is actually dependent on the number of pairs produced above @xmath46 which is not dependent on the charge deficit if screening is not achieved .",
    "comparison of figures 5a and 5c shows that pulsars with larger periods have relatively larger @xmath46 and also larger fractions of returning positrons .",
    "this is due to the fact that longer period pulsars have more difficulty producing pairs due to the smaller pc size and therefore larger radii of curvature of the last open field line . as illustrated in figure 5d ,",
    "ms pulsars have very large @xmath46 and large fractions of returning positrons , but smaller than expected from the analytic solutions , because they do not produce enough pairs to screen the field .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of returning positron fraction on pc temperature @xmath119 and surface field strength .",
    "the steep dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath119 at low temperatures @xmath124 is due to the increase in numbers of high energy ics photons that produce pairs . for @xmath125 , in the case of normal pulsars",
    "there is local screening at these field strengths , which limits the number of returning positrons to be proportional to @xmath126 rather than to @xmath119 .",
    "the screening therefore produces a saturation in the pc heating , which will be seen in the calculation of pc heating luminosities to be presented in section v.      as discussed in hm98 , the positrons returning from the upper pff will be accelerated through the same voltage drop as the primary electrons and thus will reach the same high energies as the primaries that produced them .",
    "they will therefore initiate pair cascades as they approach the ns surface .",
    "hm98 speculated that the pairs from these downward moving cascades may screen the @xmath2 above the surface since they found that the pffs of the positrons are located at significant altitudes above the surface , due to asymmetry in the ics between upward moving and downward moving particles .",
    "now that we can calculate the fraction of positrons returning from the upper ics pff , we can investigate the question of screening at the lower pff .",
    "we have simulated cascades below the pffs of test positrons returning from the upper pff .",
    "the source functions of pairs from the downward cascades and the charge density are computed in the same way as at the upper pff , and the screening scale height is determined self - consistently .",
    "but there are several critical differences between screening at upper and lower pffs .",
    "first , the flux of returning positrons from the ics pff is small compared to the primary flux and the charge density must be weighted with the value @xmath123 .",
    "second , the value of @xmath2 is very small near the ns surface , making it harder to turn around the electrons from the pairs .",
    "third , the charge deficit is much smaller than at the upper pff and decreasing toward the stellar surface , being proportional to the altitude of the returning positron pair front .",
    "this guarantees that there will be a point above the ns surface where @xmath114 will equal the charge deficit .",
    "we have computed pair source functions from cascades of downward - moving positrons and the resulting charge densities below the lower pff for a range of pulsar parameters .",
    "we find that for nearly all pulsars , the charge densities do not reach values high enough to screen @xmath2 significantly above the ns surface . for pulsars having surface fields @xmath127 and periods @xmath128 , pair multiplicities from the near - surface cascades are not high enough to balance the low fraction of returning positrons , primarily because most pairs are produced in the ground landau state in the high near - surface fields . for pulsars having lower surface fields and longer periods , screening can occur for some cases just above the surface at the highest pc temperatures .",
    "these pulsars are near the ics screening boundary ( figure 4 ) .",
    "therefore , according to our calculations it seems that ics pffs will be stable except possibly near the screening boundaries .",
    "before we discuss the pulsar death line , it is instructive to calculate the luminosity of the primary electron beam at the pff",
    ".    the luminosity of the primary beam as a function of @xmath15 ( @xmath129 ) can be written as ( see eq . [ 73 ] of mh97 , and cf .",

    "[ [ f+r ] ] and [ [ f+nr ] ] ) , as long as there is locally complete screening . when complete screening is no longer achieved , at a @xmath186 value that depends on @xmath21 and @xmath119 , the heating rate saturates because the number of pairs produced is not sufficient to return a positron flux proportional to @xmath46 .",

    "we have also plotted for comparison the calculations of pc heating luminosity from the cr pffs presented in paper i. the high @xmath186 end of the cr heating rate curves marks the cr pff pair death line for that period . where heating from positrons returning from the cr pff is present",

    "heating from ics pair fronts is not high enough to be detectable at present , even in the absence of cr pair heating .",
    "however , emission from ics pairs provides the only source of pc heating for the known ms pulsars , which have ages @xmath187 yr , since they can not produce cr pairs .",
    "this emission may be detectable if the pc temperatures are above @xmath188 k. the relatively high ics pair heating rates in the ms pulsars is due primarily to the higher voltage drop necessary to make pairs . even though the fraction of returning positrons is not large , the positrons gain more energy before hitting the ns surface .",

    "recent chandra observations of psr j0437 - 4715 ( zavlin et al . 2001 ) confirm that at least one thermal component plus a power law is needed to fit the spectrum .",
    "their preferred model consists of a two - temperature thermal blackbody , with a hotter pc core of @xmath204 k and @xmath205 km and a cooler pc rim of @xmath206 k and @xmath207 km . a blackbody fit to asca emission from psr j2124 - 3358 ( sakurai et al .",

    "grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001b ) have found a dependence @xmath213 for the ms pulsars in the cluster , not too different from what we have found for pc heating from ics pair fronts ( cf .",
    "figure 9b ) .",
    "we have explored production of electron - positron pairs by photons produced through ics of thermal x - rays by accelerated electrons above a pulsar pc . since the accelerating primary electrons can produce pairs from ics photons at much lower energies than are required to produce pairs from cr photons",
    ", it is very important to investigate the consequences of ics pair fronts for @xmath2 screening and for pc heating .",
    "we have defined  pair death \" lines in @xmath214 space as the boundary of pair production for pulsars , having dipole magnetic fields of surface strength @xmath215 g. operationally , the existence of a pair front is determined by a finite solution to equation ( [ s0 ] ) for @xmath38 , the altitude of the onset of pair creation .",
    "although we are able to give analytic formulae for the altitude of the pffs for different radiation processes , the location of the pair death lines must be determined numerically .",
    "the existence of a pair front requires much less than one pair per primary electron ( but still many pairs from the whole pc beam ) , since the very first pairs are created in the declining high - energy tail of the radiated spectrum , and also much less than the number of pairs per primary required for screening of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that virtually all known radio pulsars are capable of producing pair fronts with ics photons .",
    "a smaller number , less than half , are able to also produce pairs via cr .",
    "if the acceleration model we use is correct and pulsars have dipole fields , then this result implies that relatively few pairs are required for coherent radio emission .",
    "self - consistent calculations show that ics pair fronts produce lower fluxes of returning positrons and lower pc heating luminosities than cr pair fronts .",
    "this is due to the higher efficiency of the ics process in producing pairs at lower altitudes where both the charge deficit required to screen ( and thus the returning positron flux ) and the accelerating voltage drop are smaller . for pulsars with surface magnetic fields in the",
    " normal \" range of @xmath216 g , ics heating luminosities are several orders of magnitude lower than cr heating luminosities .",
    "however , for ms pulsars having surface fields in the range @xmath217 g , production of any pairs requires such high photon energies that ics pair fronts occur at higher altitudes , where acceleration voltage drops are high enough to produce significantly more pc heating .",
    "since most ms pulsars can not produce pairs through cr , ics pair fronts provide the only means of external pc heating .",
    "we find that for surface temperatures @xmath218 k , ics heating luminosities are in the range of detection .",
    "we find that ics pairs are able to screen the _ local _ @xmath2 in some pulsars having a high enough pc temperature , but that this local screening will not produce a complete screening of the accelerating field at all altitudes and thus will not stop the acceleration of the primary beam .",
    "this is because the number of ics pairs grows slowly , on a scale length comparable to the altitude of the pff , and then declines while the charge deficit which maintains @xmath2 continues to increase with altitude .",
    "even if the ics pair production is vigorous enough to achieve local screening of @xmath2 , it eventually can not produce the charge density ( from returning positrons ) to keep up with the increasing charge deficit ( produced by the combination of flaring field lines and inertial frame - dragging ) .",
    "the primary particles may slow their acceleration briefly , due to the local screening , but will resume acceleration once the ics pair production declines . at higher altitudes , those pulsars to the left of the cr pair death line will reach the lorentz factors ( @xmath219 ) required to produce cr pairs .",
    "in contrast to ics pair fronts , the growth of pairs above the cr pff is rapid and robust due to the sensitivity of cr photon energy and emission rate on particle lorentz factor , producing complete screening of @xmath2 in a very short distance ( cf .",
    "paper i ) . in pulsars",
    "to the right of the cr pair death line , there is not complete screening and the primary particles will continue accelerating to high altitude with their lorentz factor being possibly limited by cr reaction .",
    "we have also investigated the proposal by hm98 that pairs produced as the returning positrons are accelerated toward the ns may be able to screen the @xmath2 above the surface . using our calculated values of the returning positron flux in cases where",
    "local screening has been achieved at the ics pair fronts , we find that in most cases screening does not occur at a significant distance above the ns surface to cause disruption of a steady state or formation of pair fronts . in the cases where screening does occur near pffs significantly above the surface , the pulsars are near the ics screening boundary .",
    "the resulting instability would then not move the start of the acceleration to higher altitudes , as hm98 had envisioned , but would probably weaken or disrupt the screening at the upper ics pair front , resulting in a decrease in returning positron flux which would weaken the screening at the lower pff , etc .",
    "pc heating by cr pair fronts will dominate for pulsars to the left of the cr pair death line , while ics pair fronts will supply the pc heating for pulsars to the right of the cr pair death line .",
    "while we have given analytic expressions for the fraction of returning positrons and pc heating luminosities from ics pair fronts , these are only good estimates above the ics screening boundaries of figure 4 . below the ics screening boundaries , where local screening is not achieved for",
    "that pc temperature , the numerical values of returning positron fraction and heating luminosity fall well below the analytic estimates .",
    "this will be true for ms pulsars , nearly all of which are below the ics screening boundary for a pc temperature of even @xmath220 k.    our results are dependent on a number of assumptions inherent in our calculations .",
    "first , we have assumed that the pattern of thermal x - ray emission is from a heated pc and is a pure , isotropic blackbody . according to recent calculations ( zavlin et al .",
    "1995 ) of radiation transfer in magnetized ns atmospheres , the thermal emission is not pure blackbody or isotropic , but a somewhat cooler blackbody consisting of pencil and fan beam components .",
    "both effects of full surface ( cooler ) emission and pencil beaming would tend to decrease ics radiation and thus ics pair production efficiency .",
    "however , a large fan beam component would tend to increase ics efficiency .",
    "second , we have used a hybrid scheme to describe the ics radiation spectrum in which the rics has been treated as classical magnetic thompson scattering and nr ( or continuum ) ics has been treated as relativistic but non - magnetic . in reality , both rics and nrics should be treated as a single process with one cross section . while the magnetic qed scattering cross section has been studied for some time ( e.g. herold 1979 , daugherty & harding 1986 ) , simple expressions in limited cases are only beginning to become available ( e.g. gonthier et al . 2000 ) .",
    "our present treatment is probably accurate for magnetic fields @xmath221 which includes most of the radio pulsars .",
    "the location of a pulsar relative to the pair death lines may be important not only to its radio and thermal x - ray emission characteristics , but also to its high - energy emission properties . as we have argued in this paper , ics pair fronts will not limit the acceleration voltage drop in pulsars but that acceleration will continue until it is limited by a cr pair front .",
    "the voltage drop at the cr pair front ( together with the size of the pc current ) is therefore expected to determine the high - energy emission luminosity . in section 4 , we have noted that the acceleration voltage drop of pulsars that produce cr pair fronts is remarkably insensitive to pulsar parameters , leading to the prediction that high - energy luminosity , @xmath222 , should be simply proportional to pc current ( which is proportional to @xmath223 ) , which seems to be borne out by observations ( e.g. thompson 2000 ) .",
    "however , pulsars that do not produce cr pair fronts do not have such a limit on acceleration voltage drop and should depart from the @xmath224 dependence , and approach a @xmath225 dependence . indeed",
    ", such a departure must occur if they are not to exceed 100% efficiency in converting rotational energy loss to high - energy emission .",
    "we predict that this change in @xmath222 dependence should occur along the cr pair death line .",
    "none of the pulsars which have detected @xmath48-ray emission are to the right of the cr pair death line although some , such as geminga , are close .",
    "the large area gamma - ray telescope ( glast ) will have the sensitivity to detect @xmath48-ray emission from significant numbers of radio pulsars beyond the cr pair death line and so should be able to test this prediction .",
