    "our galactic centre region provides , arguably , the best available laboratory in which to study the central activity of galaxies .",
    "recent measurements of the proper motion of infrared stars around the dynamical centre of the galaxy coupled with the enhanced radio brightness of the region , strongly support the presence of a super massive black hole of mass ( 23)@xmath1 m@xmath2 ( _ e.g. , _ genzel et al .",
    "2000 ) in sgr  a@xmath0 . a number of unusual phenomena are also observed in the galactic centre region : _ e.g. , _ magnetic radio filaments , high density , fast - moving molecular clouds , massive star clusters , and high - temperature plasma extending over scales in excess of a few hundred parsecs , etc .",
    "a wide - angle _ xmm - newton _ survey of the galactic centre region was carried out in the period 20002001 utilising 11 pointings in total , each with 1025 ksec exposures ( see warwick 2002 ) .",
    "this _ xmm - newton _ galactic centre survey along with a complementary _ chandra _ survey ( wang et al .",
    "2002 ) has revealed the complex x - ray structure of the region .",
    "here we report some of the recent discoveries which have stemmed from the _ xmm _ galactic centre survey , focusing particularly on sgr  a@xmath0 , sgr  a east , the radio arc region , and an x - ray non - thermal filament designated xmm j174540@xmath32904.5 .",
    "[ fig : img ] shows a false colour x - ray image of the galactic centre region taken with _",
    "xmm - newton _ in which galactic north is up .",
    "most of red dots are presumably foreground stars .",
    "two persistent ( 1e 1740.7@xmath32942 and 1e 1743.1@xmath32843 ) and one transient ( sax j1747.0@xmath32853 ) x - ray binaries are apparent as very bright sources in these observations .",
    "there is extended high surface brightness emission coincident with the sgr  a and radio arc ( or g0.1@xmath30.1 ) regions .",
    "the arches star cluster and snr g0.9@xmath40.1 are also prominent in the hard energy band .",
    "in addition to these identifiable sources , low - surface brightness emission is evident over the whole region .",
    "the configuration is , however , highly asymmetric with the region to the galactic west of sgr  a being brighter and having a more complex morphology than that to the east .",
    "we also point out that there is an extended and clumpy structure extending from sgr  a towards the ( galactic ) south - west direction on a scale of several tens of parsecs .",
    "with the moderate angular resolution of _ xmm - newton _ , sgr  a@xmath0 can not be resolved .",
    "however , we have detected an x - ray flare from sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "since the flare was detected in the last tens of minutes of an observation and was increasing in brightness right up to the end of the observation , the peak luminosity is unknown ; the maximum luminosity observed was 4@xmath5erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the flare nature is basically consistent with those detected by _",
    "( baganoff et al . 2001 ) .",
    "full details are given in goldwurm et al .",
    "the sgr  a region which is characterised by extremely bright radio structure , consists of sgr  a east and west .",
    "sgr  a east is an oval shell - like radio morphology , and in projection surrounds sgr  a west , which includes sgr  a@xmath0 . from its shell - like structure , sgr  a east",
    "is supposed to be a supernova remnant ( snr ) , snr 000.0 + 00.0 , although alternative interpretations have also been proposed .",
    "[ fig : img - sgraest ] shows the _ xmm - newton _",
    "mos1 + 2 image of the sgr  a region .",
    "the x - ray emitting region is contained within the radio shell of sgr  a east , as is also readily apparent from the _ chandra _ observation ( maeda et al .",
    "we also made a 6.7-kev line narrow - band image corresponding to helium - like iron , since the x - ray spectrum of sgr  a east apparently shows that line ( see sec.[sec : sgraest - spec ] ) .",
    "the underlying continuum is subtracted using an adjacent bandpass and assuming an averaged spectral shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img - sgraest ] right panel ) . the 6.7-kev line is found to be clearly more concentrated in the core of sgr  a east than the continuum .",
    "this implies that the core of sgr  a east is more abundant in iron or higher in temperature , or perhaps a combination of these factors ( see sec.[sec : sgraest - spec ] for detail ) .",
    "we accumulated the source spectrum of sgr a east from a region of radius 100@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : img - sgraest ] ) , but excluding both sgr  a west and the region around a bright soft point source . in the spectrum ,",
    "several strong emission lines at energies corresponding to k@xmath8 lines from highly ionized ions , can be seen ( sakano et al .",
    "2002b ) .    from the line ratios of k@xmath8 lines from helium(he)-like and hydrogen(h)-like atoms , we found that the spectrum requires a multi - temperature plasma .",
    "when we approximate the spectrum with a two - temperature thin thermal plasma model by fitting all the spectra ( mos1 , 2 , and pn ) simultaneously , we obtained the best - fitting temperatures to be @xmath91  kev and @xmath94  kev .",
    "the best - fit abundances for silicon , sulfur , argon , calcium , and iron vary slightly from element to element , but are mostly in the range 12 solar units .",
    "we further examined the possible spectral variation within sgr  a east using spatially resolved spectra , and found that only the iron abundance varies significantly from place to place : @xmath90.5 solar in the outer region ( @xmath10 ) to @xmath93.5 solar in the central region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , the iron line concentration in fig .",
    "[ fig : img - sgraest ] is due to an abundance gradient .",
    "the concentration of the iron at the centre suggests that the plasma originated in ejecta . from the derived spectral parameters and spatial extent , we estimated the total energy and mass to be @xmath12 erg and 1.9@xmath13 m@xmath14 , respectively , assuming pressure equilibrium between the low- and high - temperature components , where @xmath15 is a filling factor of the total plasma . these results , therefore , favour an origin for sgr  a east in a type - ii sn event .",
    "the most intriguing problem is the extremely high temperature of 4  kev .",
    "the special environment in the galactic centre region may be responsible for it .",
    "the detailed analysis and discussion are found in sakano et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "this region is unique due to the bright structure both in the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission is coincident with the position of the molecular cloud g  0.1@xmath30.1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio brightest structure , the radio arc , is not particularly luminous in the x - ray band .",
    "another unusual characteristic is the extremely high surface brightness of the 6.4-kev line , a fluorescent k@xmath8 line from neutral iron . whereas the x - ray reflection nebula , sgr  b2 , is dim in the continuum but bright only in the 6.4-kev line ( murakami et al .",
    "2001 ) , this region is bright both in the continuum and 6.4-kev line .",
    "the origin of this x - ray structure remains an open question .",
    "a hard extended source , xmm j174540@xmath32904.5 , newly discovered with _ xmm _ ,",
    "is marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : img - sgraest ] this source has a corresponding radio non - thermal structure , the sgr a - e ` wisp ' ( ho et al .",
    "1985 ) (= 1lc 359.888@xmath30.086 = g359.88@xmath30.07 ) .",
    "both the x - ray and radio images show similar elongated structure , although the x - ray emission is more localised .",
    "we found that the x - ray emission from this source is clearly non - thermal with an energy index of 1.0@xmath16 and heavily absorbed ( @xmath17h  @xmath18 ) .",
    "so far , this is the first x - ray / radio filament in the galactic centre region which has been shown , unequivocally , to have a non - thermal x - ray spectrum .",
    "the spectral energy distribution shows that the x - ray spectrum is steeper than that observed in the radio band but is , most likely , smoothly connected to it .",
    "thus , the emission is presumably due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the lifetime of the high energy particles ( @xmath97  yr ) emitting x - rays is roughly comparable with the spatial extent of the structure .",
    "hence , the x - ray source is probably the site of particle acceleration .",
    "the position of the x - ray source coincides with the peak of the molecular cloud and it is quite possible that dense environment is one factor in determining this as an efficient acceleration site .",
    "this represents one of only a few x - ray / radio non - thermal filament known in the galactic centre region .",
