    "to write a field theoretical model which has nonzero values for the coupling constants at zeroes of the beta function of the renormalization group is an endeavor which is still continuing in particle physics .",
    "the @xmath0 theory is a `` laboratory '' where different methods in quantum field theory are first applied .",
    "after it was shown that this model became a trivial theory when the cutoff was removed , @xcite , it was clear that analyzing the terms in the perturbation series was not sufficient to decide whether one had a truly interacting theory .",
    "work in this field was also given by wilson and others , @xcite .",
    "renormalization group methods , first introduced by wilson for this purpose @xcite , are the most commonly used technique in studying whether one has a trivial theory or not .    since",
    "a nontrivial fixed point is not yet found for qcd , there are attempts to study alternative models for this purpose is given in @xcite .",
    "a very popular model is the nambu - jona - lasinio model , hereafter njl , @xcite .",
    "this model is written in terms of spinor fields only , and is used as an effective theory extensively in high energy physics @xcite .",
    "the njl model was also shown to be trivial @xcite .",
    "recent attempts to gauge this model to obtain a nontrivial theory are given in references @xcite .",
    "both functional and diagram summing methods were used in these papers .",
    "exact renormalization group methods proposed by wilson and polchinski , @xcite , are often employed for this purpose . a very recent paper on this method is given by sonoda @xcite .",
    "another model , which uses only spinors is the g \" ursey model @xcite .",
    "we have worked on different forms of the g \" ursey model @xcite .",
    "our starting point was both our earlier work , @xcite , where g \" ursey model lagrangian was attempted to be written in a polynomial form , and recent work , @xcite , which suggested that the gauged form of the njl model can be interpreted as a nontrivial theory .",
    "in @xcite we reinterpreted our earlier work , @xcite , and showed that rather than finding a trivial theory , as claimed in @xcite , we ended up in a model where composite particles took part in physical processes .",
    "the constituent fields , however , did not interact with each other when perturbation theory was applied to the model , as already shown in @xcite . in @xcite , we showed that , when this model is coupled to a constituent @xmath1 gauge field , we were mimicking a gauge higgs - yukawa ( ghy ) system , which had the known problems of the landau pole , with all of its connotations of triviality .",
    "the essential point of our earlier work was the fact that the propagator of the composite scalar field was equal to @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath3 goes to zero as the cutoff is removed , many of the diagrams , where the scalar field propagator takes part as an internal line , become convergent .",
    "we could show that there was no breaking of the chiral symmetry , thus no mass generation , for the fermion fields in our model in higher orders of perturbation theory .    here",
    "we will study our original model @xcite , coupled to a @xmath4 gauge field and use solely renormalization group techniques .",
    "we start with the description of our starting model without the gauge field @xcite .",
    "then we derive the renormalization group equations ( rges ) in one loop , and try to derive the criteria for obtaining non - trivial fixed points for the coupling constants of the theory . here",
    "we closely follow the line of discussion followed in our reference @xcite . in our model",
    ", however , there is a composite scalar field with a propagator completely different from a constituent scalar field used in this reference .",
    "this gives rise to rge s in our case which are different from those given by harada et al .",
    "since our starting models are different the motivation of our work is different from that of this reference .",
    "we show that the renormalization group equations point to the non - triviality of the model when it is coupled to an @xmath4 gauge field .",
    "we end up with a few remarks in the last section .",
    "our initial model is given by the lagrangian    @xmath5    here the only terms with kinetic part are the spinors .",
    "@xmath6 is a lagrange multiplier field , @xmath7 is a scalar field with no kinetic part , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are coupling constants .",
    "this expression contains two constraint equations , obtained from writing the euler - lagrange equations for the @xmath6 and @xmath10 fields .",
    "hence , it should be quantized by using the dirac constraint analysis as performed in reference @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian given above is just an attempt in writing the original g \" ursey lagrangian    @xmath11    in a polynomial form .",
    "we already showed how the @xmath12 invariance of the grsey lagrangian , which prevents the fermion field from acquiring a finite mass in higher orders , is retained in our model , and the fact that our model is equivalent to the original grsey model only classically in @xcite .",
    "to quantize the latter system consistently we proceed via the path integral method .",
    "this procedure is carried out in reference @xcite . at the end of these calculations",
    "we find out that we can write the constrained lagrangian given in equation ( [ cl ] ) as    @xmath13\\psi-{{a}\\over{4}}(\\phi^{4}+2\\phi^{3}\\xi-2\\phi\\xi^{3}- \\xi^{4})+{i\\over{4}}c^*(\\phi^{2}+2\\phi\\xi+\\xi^{2 } ) c , \\label{eff1}\\ ] ]    where the effective lagrangian is expressed in terms of scalar fields @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , ghost fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 and spinor fields only .",
    "the fermion propagator is the usual dirac propagator in lowest order , as can be seen from the lagrangian . after integrating over the fermion fields in the path integral",
    ", we obtain the effective action .",
    "the second derivative of the effective action with respect to the @xmath14 field gives us the induced inverse propagator for the @xmath14 field , with the infinite part given as    @xmath18=   { { g^2   q^2}\\over { 4\\pi \\epsilon}}.\\ ] ]    here dimensional regularization is used for the momentum integral and @xmath19 .",
    "we see that the @xmath14 field propagates as a massless field .",
    "when we study the propagators for the other fields , we see that no linear or quadratic term in @xmath15 exists , so the one loop contribution to the @xmath15 propagator is absent . similarly the mixed derivatives of the effective action with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath14 are zero at one loop , so no mixing between these two fields occurs .",
    "we can also set the propagators of the ghost fields to zero , since they give no contribution in the one loop approximation .",
    "the higher loop contributions are absent for these fields .    in reference @xcite we also studied the contributions to the fermion propagator at higher orders and we found , by studying the dyson - schwinger equations for the two point function , that there were no new contributions .",
    "we had at least one phase where the mass of the spinor field was zero .",
    "here we couple an @xmath20 gauge field to the model .",
    "we also take spinors with different flavors , up to @xmath21 .",

    "we see that both the @xmath15 and the ghost fields coming from the compositeness constraint decouple from our model .    at this point",
    "we have to note that there are two kinds of ghost contributions in the new model .",
    "the ghosts coming from the gauge condition on the vector field do not decouple , and contribute to the renormalization group equations in the usual way .",
    "we impose these constraints on equation ( [ newlag ] ) .    after these steps we start with the effective lagrangian given as    @xmath26-\\frac{a}{4}\\phi^4+\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{f}}\\overline{\\psi}_{i } id\\!\\!\\!\\!/\\psi_{i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{f}}g\\phi\\overline{\\psi}_{i}\\psi_{i } + l_{\\mbox{ghost}}+ l_{\\mbox{gauge fixing}}.\\ ] ]    here",

    "hence we do not have contributions proportional to @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as one would have in the ghy system as described in the work of @xcite .",
    "since the diagrams , omitted in @xcite via a @xmath46 analysis , are down by an order of @xmath47 in our analysis , we do not need a relation between @xmath48 and the coupling constants at this point .",

    "this means that when we set the @xmath32 term to zero , the yukawa running coupling constant decreases exponentially to zero . for this limit the gauge and the quadratic coupling constants go just to a constant .      if @xmath33 approaches @xmath32 , the limit depends on the value of @xmath52 .",
