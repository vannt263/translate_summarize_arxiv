    "recently the study of transverse momentum dependent distribution functions is among the special issues in hadronic physics .",
    "of particular interest , are two leading - twist ( nave ) time - reversal odd transverse momentum dependent distribution functions : sivers function  @xcite @xmath4 and its chiral - odd partner @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "sivers function represents the unpolarized parton distribution in a transversely polarized hadron , while @xmath0 denotes the parton transversity distribution in an unpolarized hadron . one main motivation",
    "to investigate these two distributions is that they are the possible sources of the unsuppressed azimuthal asymmetries observed in hadronic reactions .",
    "the former distribution function was proposed first by sivers  @xcite to illustrate that it can lead to large single - spin azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "this nontrivial correlation between the transverse momentum of the quark and the polarization of the hadron was thought to be forbidden by time - reversal invariance  @xcite .",
    "recently a direct calculation  @xcite of sivers asymmetry by inclusion of final - state ( in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering(sidis ) ) or initial - state interaction ( in drell - yan process ) shows that the asymmetry is in principle non - zero",
    ". then it was found that the presence of the wilson lines in the operators defining the parton densities allows for the sivers effect without a violation of time - reversal invariance  @xcite , and the final- or initial - state interaction can be factorized into a full gauge - invariance definition of transverse momentum dependent distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical developments open a wide range of phenomenological applications .",
    "several model calculations  @xcite of sivers function have been performed to estimate single - spin asymmetries in sidis process , which is under investigation by current experiment  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown  @xcite that non - zero @xmath0 can arise from the same mechanism which produces @xmath4 .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that @xmath0 can account for the substantial cos@xmath5 asymmetries in unpolarized drell - yan lepton pair production from pion - nucleon scattering : @xmath6  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , boer , brodsky , and hwang computed @xmath0 of the proton in a quark - scalar - diquark model within soft gluon exchange .",
    "they found that @xmath0 is equal to @xmath4 obtained from the same model .",
    "then the maximum magnitude of the cos@xmath5 asymmetries in @xmath7 is estimated to be @xmath830@xmath9 , by using the calculated @xmath0 . in this paper , we perform the first computation on @xmath0 of the pion ( denoted as @xmath10 ) in a quark - spectator - antiquark model in presence of final - state interaction , in similar to the quark - scalar - diquark model of the proton . we find that the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath10 in our model is the same as that of @xmath0 of the proton from the quark - scalar - diquark model , although the @xmath3 dependence is different .",
    "this feature allows one to expect that @xmath10 and @xmath0 are closely related . with the present model result",
    "we investigate the cos2@xmath1 asymmetry in unpolarized @xmath2 drell - yan process and obtain an unsuppressed result .",
    "the shape of the asymmetry is similar to the cos@xmath5 asymmetries in @xmath11 , estimated in ref .",
    "the result suggests a connection between cos2@xmath1 asymmetries in drell - yan processes with different initial hadrons .",
    "in this section , we present the calculation @xmath0 of the pion .",

    "the pion momentum is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the path - ordered exponential ( wilson line ) with the form : @xmath17 releasing the constraint of ( nave ) time - reversal invariance and keeping parity invariance and hermiticity , the quark correlation function of the pion can be parameterized into a set of transverse momentum dependent distribution functions in leading twist as follows  @xcite @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the light - like vector with components @xmath20 , @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 and @xmath10 denote the unpolarized quark distribution and the quark transversity of the pion , respectively .",

    "it is similar to the quark - scalar - diquark model for calculating sivers function and @xmath25 of the proton , and the differences are that the intermediate state here is the constituent antiquark instead , as shown in fig .  1 , and that the pion - quark - antiquark interaction is modelled by pseudoscalar coupling : @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the pion - quark - antiquark coupling constant , and @xmath28 is the charge of the antiquark .",
    "@xmath22 can be calculated from the lowest order @xmath29 without the path - ordered exponential . from fig .",
    "[ lo ] we obtain @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the outgoing quark which is the same of the antiquark , @xmath32 is the spinor of the antiquark and the quark momentum @xmath33 .",

    "the exponential serves as the final - state interaction  ( fsi ) or initial - state interaction  ( isi ) between the struck quark and the remnant of the hadron , which is also viewed as the soft gluon scattering , to provide nontrivial phase to generate t - odd distribution function . in our calculation",
    "we expand path - ordered exponential to first order , means that the final- or / and initial - state interaction is modelled by one gluon exchange , as shown in fig .",
    "thus the nonzero @xmath10 can be calculated from the expression @xmath39 in which @xmath40 represents the antiquark spectator state , and @xmath41 is the charge of the struck quark . in momentum space",
    "we write down : @xmath42 the @xmath43 in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ h1 t ] ) comes from the antiquark - gluon interaction vertex .",
    "the @xmath44 integral can be done from the contour method .",
    "@xmath45 integral is realized from taking the imaginary part of the eikonal propagator : @xmath46 .",

    "with @xmath22 and @xmath10 we estimate @xmath61 $ ] , which is proportional to the cos2@xmath1 asymmetries in unpolarized drell - yan process .",
    "we choose the mass parameters @xmath62  gev for the constituent quark mass and @xmath63  gev for the pion mass .",
    "to generalize our model result to the consequence in qcd we extrapolate the coupling constant @xmath64 , and take @xmath65 which is adopted in ref .",

    "the general form of the angular differential cross section for unpolarized @xmath74 drell - yan process is @xmath75 where @xmath1 is the angle between the lepton plane and the plane of the incident hadrons in the lepton pair center of mass frame ( see fig .  [ drell - yan ] ) .",
    "the experimental data show large value of @xmath76 near to 30% , which can not be explained by perturbative qcd .",
