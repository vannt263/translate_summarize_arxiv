    "the riemann period matrix @xmath8 and the matrix of @xmath9-periods @xmath10 are computed in a canonical homology basis @xmath11 .",
    "the modern interest in the thomae formulae was initially stimulated by the finite - gap integration of kdv and kp type equations where , according to the dubrovin - novikov program of `` effectivization of the finite - gap solutions '' , it was necessary to express winding vectors in the its - matveev formula  @xcite in terms of @xmath3-constants ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in this context thomae formulae were recently considered in @xcite .",
    "thomae formulae were used to describe the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves with level two structure in terms of theta constants @xcite .",
    "they give a generalization of the @xmath12 function of an elliptic curve @xcite ( umemura s appendix ) and @xcite . in",
    "@xcite they were combined with the arithmetic - geometric mean to obtain criteria for the reducibility of ultraelliptic jacobians .",
    "thomae formulae also appear in a wider context of modern research on integrable systems , in particular in the riemann - hilbert problem and the associated schlesinger equations ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . in this set of problems",
    "the thomae formulae were used to give explicit expression for the @xmath13-function of the schlesinger equation associated with hyperelliptic curve @xcite , general curve with simple branch points @xcite and non simple branch points @xcite .",
    "thomae formulas are also used to compute action variables in conditions of complete integrability ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the conformal field theory thomae formulae became relevant after the work of knizhnik @xcite who expressed correlation functions of the multi - loop string amplitude in terms of @xmath3-constants of a riemann surface with @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "a solution of knizhnik - zamolodchikov equations in terms of @xmath3-constants was also obtained in @xcite on the basis of thomae formulae .",
    "after the classical thomae paper @xcite the derivation of thomae formulae in hyperelliptic case was given in many places : fuchs @xcite , bolza @xcite , fay @xcite , mumford @xcite .",
    "but only recently bershadsky and radul @xcite discovered a generalization of thomae formula for @xmath14 curve @xmath15 and gave a heuristic proof of them on the basis of path integral formulation of the conformal field theory .",
    "afterwards nakayashiki @xcite developed a rigourous derivation of these formulae in the frame of the classical methods .    in this paper",
    "we derive the thomae formula for the singular curve @xmath16 which has @xmath2 symmetry and it will be called singular @xmath2 curves .",
    "the modular properties of certain family of curves ( [ zvcurve ] ) were investigated by burhardt @xcite , hutchinson @xcite , more recently by shiga @xcite and koike @xcite , diez @xcite and others .",
    "this curve ( [ zvcurve ] ) appeared in zverovich @xcite as the curve related to a solvable riemann - hilbert problem with quasi - permutation monodromy matrices .",
    "explicit solution of this problem was derived in our recent paper @xcite which stimulated the present investigation .",
    "our proof of thomae formulae goes up to the original thomae paper @xcite and inherits principal steps of the nakayashiki s proof @xcite for non singular @xmath2 curves .",
    "the non singular @xmath2 curves are invariant under the group generated by the permutations of branch points , while the singular @xmath2 curves are not .",
    "this is the main difference with the case treated by nakayashiki .",
    "the main steps of our proof are the explicit algebraic formula for the szeg kernel associated with non - singular @xmath1-period and the explicit formula for the canonical bimeromorphic differential kernel .",
    "the above kernel functions can be realized in @xmath3-functional form , and in algebraic forms . in the former case",
    "the theory was developed by fay @xcite , in the latter case the theory has originated in the work of klein @xcite and later it was developed by baker @xcite and also @xcite,@xcite and for nonsingular @xmath2 curves by nakayashiki @xcite .",
