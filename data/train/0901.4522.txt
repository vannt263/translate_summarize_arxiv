    "recent technological advances have prompted significant interest in developing the foundations of quantum control theory .",
    "one major concern is how to design the dynamics to steer the system state to a stationary target state , or track the natural trajectory of non - stationary states .",
    "numerous results have been obtained on the theory of lyapunov - based control  @xcite and the references in @xcite .",
    "most papers have used the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) distance as the most natural lyapunov function and in this setting @xcite showed that the target state is asymptotically stable under a sufficient condition equivalent to controllability of the linearized system for pure states represented by wavefunctions , although an additional control had to be added to fix the relative phase of the state . an alternative design based on an implicit lyapunov function",
    "was proposed in @xcite to render ( pure ) target states asymptotically stable when the linearized system is not controllable .",
    "the more general case of systems whose states must be represented by density operators was recently considered in  @xcite , but our analysis for generic quantum states  @xcite , for instance , showed the dynamical landscape and convergence behavior to be more complicated than described in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this technote is to extend this analysis to non - generic states , which , although a set of measure zero , deserve special consideration as they include important cases such as pseudo - pure states .    specifically we show that , although the lasalle invariant set for non - generic states is much larger than in the generic case , for ideal systems the target state not only remains isolated and thus locally asymptotically stable , but a dynamical systems analysis for stationary target states shows that all other critical manifolds are unstable and attract at most a measure - zero subset of the state space . at least for the stationary target states , these arguments rigorously show that we indeed have almost global convergence as claimed in @xcite , although the set of states _ not _ attracted to the target state is significantly larger than claimed in  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for effectiveness of the method for stationary target states are similar to those for generic states , and we again find that center manifolds emerge around the target state when these conditions are not satisfied , but in contrast to the generic case , the emergence of a center manifold now is conditional on the target state , i.e. , the method may still be effective for some target states even if the ideal hamiltonian criteria are not satisfied . for the special class of pseudo - pure states , we can further show explicitly that for systems with ideal hamiltonians , the method is effective not only for stationary target states but also for almost all non - stationary ones .",
    "this is similar to the situation for the generic case but in this special case we can characterize the non - regular target states explicitly , which shows that they include some states of special interest such as so - called cat states and maximally entangled states .",
    "we study the bilinear hamiltonian control problem for a quantum system on an @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the state of such a system is generally represented by a trace - one positive operator @xmath2 on @xmath1 , referred to as _ density operator _ , whose evolution is governed by the quantum liouville equation @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is an admissible real - valued control , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are time - independent hamiltonians corresponding to free evolution and control interaction terms , respectively .    a density operator @xmath2 represents a _ pure _ state if it is a rank - one projector , and a _ mixed _ state otherwise ; @xmath2 is generic if it has @xmath0 distinct eigenvalues , and _ pseudo - pure _ if its spectrum has only two distinct eigenvalues occurring with multiplicities @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the control problem is to design a control @xmath4 such that the system state @xmath9 converges to the target state @xmath10 as @xmath11 . for hamiltonian evolution",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath10 to be reachable from an initial state @xmath12 is that both @xmath12 and @xmath10 have the same spectrum , and we shall assume this condition to be satisfied here .",
    "the set of density operators isospectral with @xmath10 forms a compact manifold @xmath13 , whose dimension depends on the spectrum of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is a stationary state of the system if and only if @xmath14=0 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath10 is not a stationary state then the control problem becomes a trajectory - tracking problem , and to be able to apply lasalle s invariance principle to this case , we formulate the control dynamics on an extended state space @xmath15 :    @xmath16,\\\\   \\dot{\\rho}_d(t ) & = -i [ h_0,\\rho_d(t)],\\\\   f(\\rho,\\rho_d )   & = \\tr([-ih_1,\\rho(t)]\\rho_d(t)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eqn : auto ]    where the control function @xmath17 is chosen such that @xmath18                  = \\tr(\\rho_d^2)-\\tr(\\rho\\rho_d)\\ ] ] is non - increasing along any flow , i.e. , @xmath19)= -f^2(t)\\le 0.\\ ] ] thus , the dynamical system @xmath20 is autonomous , all solutions are bounded , and @xmath21 is a lyapunov function on @xmath15 .",
    "from lasalle s invariance principle  @xcite we have :    [ thm : lasalle:2 ] any evolution @xmath22 for the dynamical system ( [ eqn : auto ] ) will converge to the lasalle invariant set , @xmath23 .",
    "the effectiveness of the control in steering the system towards the target state depends on the asymptotic stability of @xmath10 .",
    "local asymptotic stability is a prerequisite for almost global convergence , and a necessary and sufficient condition for the former is that the target state be isolated in @xmath24 .",

    "since @xmath10 achieves the minimum of @xmath47 , these eigenvalues must have negative real parts , i.e. , @xmath10 must be a sink .",
