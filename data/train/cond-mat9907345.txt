    "as a microscopic model for high - t@xmath6 superconductors we use the single - band hubbard model in 2d , with the nearest - neighbor hopping element @xmath9 and the local coulomb repulsion @xmath10 . the fluctuation exchange approximation @xcite ( flex ) is used to treat the superconducting state in the standard nambu - eliashberg formalism with the spin fluctuations of the flex as the pairing interaction @xcite . from the self - consistent solution of the dyson equation one can determine @xmath5 as the highest temperature for which the off - diagonal self energy is non - vanishing .",
    "usually this is the criterion for the critical temperature @xmath4 , but this is only true if one can neglect the role of phase fluctuations .",
    "however , when the superfluid density is small , phase fluctuations will destroy phase coherence , while the charge carriers still form local cooper pairs , which is signaled by a non zero amplitude of the superconducting order parameter .    to extend the flex to include phase fluctuations self - consistently",
    ", one has to know their self - energy contribution . in order to derive it we start with a phenomenological model of tight - binding electrons and an effective nearest - neighbor pairing interaction for electrons with opposite spins , leading to a superconducting _ d_-wave order parameter in the mean - field approximation .",
    "we begin by writing down the action @xmath11 for the tight - binding electrons where the interaction term is decoupled by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , introducing a decoupling field @xmath12 , which turns out to be the superconducting order parameter : @xmath13&= &    \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau\\ ; \\bigg\\ { \\sum_{i \\sigma } \\phi_{i      \\sigma}^ * ( \\partial_{\\tau } - \\mu ) \\phi_{i \\sigma } +",

    "@xmath17 is the pairing interaction and @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the doping is controlled by the chemical potential @xmath18 .",
    "we now assume the local superconducting order parameter @xmath19 to have a time and translational invariant amplitude @xmath20 with _ d_-wave symmetry but a fluctuating phase suppressing superconducting order in the pseudogap regime below @xmath8 .",
    "we perform the following transformation to decouple the phase and amplitude degrees of freedom of the order parameter @xcite : @xmath21 }    \\quad\\mbox{.}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to an expression for the action where the phase is directly coupled to the fermions by the elementary vertices shown in figure [ fig : vertices ] .    after integrating out the fermionic degree of freedom , a loop expansion up to second order in the phase fields @xmath22 leads to the effective action for the phases , taking the form of a time - dependent xy model on a cubic lattice . from the effective action we determine the propagator of the phase fluctuations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density - density correlation function and the dynamical phase stiffness",
    "is given by @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the expectation value of the inverse band - mass operator and @xmath27 is the current - current correlation function calculated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the superfluid density is the density of _ phase coherent _ cooper pairs only , which are responsible for the meissner effect .",
    "if no phase fluctuations are present it will take the value of the local cooper - pair density @xmath28 . since in the london theory @xmath1",
    "is related to the london penetration depth by @xmath29 we can determine @xmath4 as the temperature where the meissner effect and therefore the superfluid density @xmath30 refering to phase coherent cooper pairs vanishes .",
    "this can be seen as the loss of rigidity against long - range phase fluctuations and is consistent with the transition from quasi long - range to short - range order in 2d @xcite . for @xmath31",
    "the dynamical phase stiffness will be non - zero for certain @xmath32 and @xmath33 and will result in superconducting order on finite length and time scales and will finally vanish for all momenta and frequencies at @xmath8 , where @xmath28 goes to zero @xcite .    from the generating functional for the fermions",
    "we determine the self - energy corrections due to phase fluctuations in lowest order .",
    "combining this self - energy contribution with the contribution of standard flex and taking the renormalized propagator of the phase fluctuations , which means that one has to calculate @xmath34 and @xmath24 with _ renormalized _ green functions , gives a set of self - consistency equation for the renormalized green functions . in this way we get",
    "an extension of the usual flex equations with the dyson equation shown in figure [ fig : dyson ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : phasediagram ] we show results for the critical temperature @xmath8 at which cooper pairs are formed and for @xmath4 where the phase of the cooper pairs become coherent .",
    "@xmath8 is determined within standard flex as the highest temperature for which the off - diagonal self energy is non - zero .",
    "@xmath4 is calculated using the kosterlitz - thouless criterion@xcite @xmath35 for the temperature where phase coherence vanishes . here",
    "@xmath36 is calculated within flex approximation and @xmath37 is half of the @xmath38-axis lattice constant . note the kosterlitz - thouless criterion neglects the coupling between amplitude and phase fluctuations , which is expected to be important for the overdoped regime .",
    "also we show flex results for @xmath39 extrapolated to @xmath40 , indicating @xmath41 in the underdoped regime .",
    "we find @xmath42 @xcite . in accordance with experimental findings",
    "we expect that our results for @xmath43 and @xmath4 should decrease more rapidly for doping @xmath44 due to the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic transition which is not properly described in the flex .",
    "it is interesting to note , that @xmath45 in the overdoped regime as expected for increasing cooper pair density , although using the kosterlitz - thouless criterion neglects coupling of amplitude and phase fluctuations .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 , since @xmath39 increases rapidly below @xmath8 as compared to the underdoped regime .",
    "the result for @xmath43 in the overdoped regime suggests that @xmath41 is no longer valid there .",
    "the scaled curve @xmath7 crosses @xmath8 at optimal doping .",
    "our result for @xmath4 and @xmath8 already yield the observed behavior .",
    "we expect that a selfconsistent inclusion of phase fluctuations in flex will give better agreement with experiment , in particular a more rapid decrease of @xmath4 for @xmath44 .",
    "the extended flex theory shown in figure [ fig : dyson ] should give for the underdoped superconductors @xmath47 , @xmath48 at @xmath4 to obtain no meissner effect above @xmath4 , and the pseudogaps in the single - particle spectral density .",
    "note , the coupling of the phase to its conjugate variable , the charge density , becomes important as the doping goes to zero .",
