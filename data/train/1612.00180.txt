    "several molecular complexes in the central @xmath0  pc of the milky way are not only prominent ir or submm sources , but they are also bright in x - rays ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "their spectra have several features characteristic for x - ray reflection by cold gas .",
    "it was suggested that sgr  a@xmath1 ( a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy ) is responsible for the illumination of these clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggestion implies that sgr  a@xmath1 , despite its present - day low luminosity , was much brighter few hundred year ago .",
    "since then , the problem of clouds illumination has been subject to many theoretical and observational studies ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "one of the specific predictions of the illumination / reflection scenario is that the continuum emission is polarized @xcite .",
    "the polarization can not only constrain the position of a primary source illuminating a given cloud ( from the orientation of the polarization plane ) , but also the position of the cloud along the line of sight ( from the degree of polarization ) .",
    "there were many studies that consider the reflection scenarios in the gc region .",
    "here we return to this problem to emphasize the power of long - term monitoring of the reflected emission .",
    "we illustrate this point by using models of the molecular gas distribution in the central @xmath2100 pc around sgr a@xmath1 to calculate the expected reflected signal over few hundred years . even although the true distribution of the gas is likely more complicated than prescribed by these models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this exercise shows that mapping molecular gas by x - ray observations will eventually lead to a clear 3d picture of the central molecular zone .",
    "we show that new x - ray polarimetry missions that are currently under study by esa and nasa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have sufficient sensitivity to make a decisive contribution in resolving the ambiguity in the position of molecular clouds along the line of sight , and consequently confirm or reject the identification of sgr a@xmath1 as a primary source of the illumination .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the distance to sgr  a@xmath1 @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion of different distance indicators ) , therefore @xmath4 corresponds to 2.37  pc .",
    "we first consider a simple case of a uniform spherical cloud illuminated by a steady source and we perform full monte carlo simulations of the emergent spectrum , taking into account multiple scatterings , similar to @xcite .",
    "we assume that the primary unpolarized x - ray source is located at a large distance from the cloud ( much larger than the size of the cloud ) and , therefore , the cloud is illuminated by a parallel beam of radiation , i.e. incoming photons are hitting a hemisphere facing the primary source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] in appendix [ ap : model ] ) .",
    "the illuminating source has a power law spectrum with a photon index @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon energy .",
    "since we are interested primarily in the reflected spectrum in the 1 - 10 kev band , the behavior of the spectrum at high energies is not very important for this study .      in modelling the radiative transfer , we followed the assumptions used in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have included the following processes : photoelectric absorption , fluorescence , rayleigh and compton scattering .",
    "the abundance of heavy elements in the molecular gas is highly uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to model photoelectric absorption we used solar abundance of heavy elements from @xcite , but set the abundance of iron to 1.6 solar ( see , e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cross sections for photoelectric absorption were taken from approximations of and @xcite .",
    "for calculation of the fluorescent emission we used fluorescent yields from .",
    "the fluorescent lines of all astrophysically abundant elements were included in the calculations and added to the corresponding bins of the scattered spectrum .",
    "the fluorescent photons are emitted isotropically without any net polarized .",
    "the modeling of the rayleigh and compton scattering employs differential cross - sections from the glecs package @xcite of the geant code @xcite and the klein - nishina formula for free electrons .",
    "this model effectively accounts for effects of bound electron on the shape of the compton shoulder of scattered fluorescent lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a less sharp peak of the backscattered emission .",
    "the photons coming from the direction of the primary source are absorbed or scattered in the cloud .",
    "a weight @xmath8 is assigned to each incoming photon .",
    "the evolution of each photon is traced for multiple scatterings inside the cloud , each time reducing the weight according to the probability of being absorbed or escape from the cloud after each scattering .",
    "the process stops once the weight drops below a certain threshold , in our case @xmath9 .      with the above assumption the emergent spectrum depends on two parameters : i ) the optical depth of the cloud , parametrized via the thomson optical depth of the cloud @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number density of hydrogen atoms and @xmath12 is the radius of the cloud , and ii ) @xmath13 , the cosine of the angle @xmath14 between the direction of the primary beam and the line of sight ( see fig .  [",

    "each plotted spectrum is slightly shifted in energy .",

    "has a shape resembling the shape of the incident spectrum ( except at low energies , where photoelectric absorption strongly dominates thomson scattering ) .",
    "as the optical depth increases the spectrum evolves towards a typical `` reflection '' spectrum from a semi - infinite medium .",
    "the right panel shows the variations of the spectrum with the viewing angle , while the optical depth is fixed to @xmath18 . in this case , the scattering by @xmath2160 , i.e. back scattering , leads again to the spectrum resembling reflection from semi - infinite medium with a flat ( and even slightly raising with energy ) spectrum ( the red line ) . in the small - angle scattering limit ,",
    "i.e. , we view a cloud illuminated from the back , the spectrum has a stronger decline at low energies , caused by the photoelectric absorption ( the black line ) .    in section  [ sec : comp ] we use these spectra in application to the real data to single out the contribution of the reflected emission to the observed x - ray spectra in the gc region .",
    "an xspec - ready model `` crefl16 '' based on  [ sec : rad ] is publicly available ( see appendix [ ap : model ] for a short description ) .",
    "the model covers 0.3 - 100 kev energy range .",
    "apart from the normalization , the model has four parameters : radial thomson optical depth of the cloud , slope of the primary power law spectrum , abundance of heavy elements and the cosine of the viewing angle .",

    "the image was accumulated over all publicly available observations in the archive . in this image ,",
    "sgr a@xmath1 is located in a red patch near to the centre of the image . in this section",
    "we will use the data from this @xmath20 ( @xmath21  pc ) area for spectral analysis of the diffuse emission and decomposition of the spectrum into two components ( see also * ? ? ? * for the corresponding emission in x - ray continuum and soft x - ray lines ) .      for spectrum extraction",
    "we have selected four regions shown with black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_maps ] .",
    "three bigger circles cover regions known to be bright in the reflected radiation , from left to right : sgr b2 , the `` bridge '' and sgr c ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting spectra , after excising contributions from bright point sources , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_4reg ] with black crosses .",
    "the fourth ( smaller ) circle is chosen , rather arbitrarily , to represent an example of x - ray bright region with a weak reflected component .",
    "all four spectra show two very prominent x - ray lines at 6.7 and 6.9 kev that have been identified with the lines of he - like and h - like ions of iron , produced by hot plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite of the diffuse appearance of this component , it can , at least partly , be attributed to the emission coming from compact sources - accreting white dwarfs as in the galactic ridge ( see * ? ? ? * ) , while the fractional contribution of compact source may vary across the region considered here .",
    "the three spectra the from regions known to be bright in reflected emission , show , in addition , a very prominent line at @xmath26.4 kev , corresponding to fluorescent emission of neutral ( or weakly ionized ) iron .",
    "assuming that the diffuse x - ray emission in the gc regions can be produced by the sum of hot plasma emission and reflected emission , we try to model the observed spectra as a linear combination of these two spectral templates . we reproduce the hot plasma component with the apec model @xcite of an optically thin plasma emission with a temperature fixed to 6  kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the reflected component we have selected one of the simulated spectra of the reflected emission , namely the one corresponding to @xmath18 and the scattering angle of 90 .",
    "while these two templates are not able to describe the full complexity of the observed spectra , the hope is that over a limited energy range from @xmath25 to @xmath28 kev these two templates might capture essential signatures of both components .",
    "we therefore fit the observed spectra with the sum of these templates and we determine their normalizations , while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "we use : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the observed spectrum , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the template spectra for the reflected component and for hot plasma emission , respectively , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the free parameters of the fit .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_4reg ] .",
    "the red and blue lines show the reflected and hot plasma components and the green line shows the sum . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", the best fit can reproduce the essential features of the spectrum .",
    "for each of the three regions with a prominent reflection component the fit clearly shows that the reflected and hot plasma components contribute roughly equally to the continuum .",
    "later , in ",
    "[ sec : xipe ] , we will use this result in order to estimate the polarization of the total emission .",
    "[ fig : xmm_4reg ] shows that for the forth region the quality of the fit is worse and the contribution of the reflected component is anyway small .",
    "we used this region only for the sake of a test , to compare with the results for three other regions .",
    "given the success of the template fitting in selected regions ( see , ",
    "[ sec:2 t ] ) , we use the same approach to make a map of the reflected component .",
    "since our model is linear , we can easily do the decomposition by calculating in every pixel of the image the scalar products of the observed spectra with the two spectral templates in the 5 - 8 kev band , and solve for the best - fitting amplitudes .",
    "when calculating scalar products , the template spectra have been convolved with the instrument spectral response .",
    "the maps of the two components ( best - fitting amplitudes for each template ) derived from _ xmm - newton _ data are shown in the two lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_maps ] .",
    "the maps have been adaptively smoothed to reach the required level of statistics ( number of counts in the 5 - 8  kev band per smoothing window ) .",
    "the resulting maps appear qualitatively similar to the 6.4 kev maps derived in ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , confirming that this simple approach can be used to reveal the morphology of the reflected emission and estimate its flux .",
    "a more elaborate spectral analysis is done below .",
    "even a more convincing and powerful spectral test on the nature of the `` reflected '' component is possible for regions where we see significant variability of the diffuse emission .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_ab ] , where the difference between the spectra labelled as a and b , obtained during two different epochs , are shown .",
    "for this exercise , the _ chandra _ data in 2000 - 2008 and 2009 - 2015 were used .",
    "we extracted the spectra from the red circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_ab ] , where variability of the diffuse emission flux was particularly strong . in the difference spectrum ,",
    "all steady components must be gone and we expect to see a pure reflection component .",
    "this procedure effectively simplifies the spectral modeling and therefore can be used to place stronger constraints on the reflected component alone .",
    "indeed , the difference spectrum can be well described by a pure reflection model with @xmath28 , cosine of the scattering angle @xmath29 and an additional hydrogen column density of absorbing gas @xmath30 .",
    "potentially this approach provides the most robust way to spectrally determine the position of the cloud along the line of sight , since the shape of the spectrum , e.g. , the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line , depends on the scattering angle due to the difference in the angular distributions for scattered and fluorescent photons avoiding the necessity of modelling complicated background / foreground",
    ". however , there are several caveats .",
    "one caveat is the abundance of iron ( and heavy elements in general ) , and as a consequence , the expected equivalent width of the line is uncertain .",
    "the second is the geometry of the cloud that is important in the case of substantial optical depth of the cloud .",
    "the last uncertainty is purely instrumental and applies to the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_ab ] - we used both acis - i and acis - s for this analysis , correcting for the differences in the effective area , but neglecting the difference in energy resolution , which is clearly an oversimplification .",
    "this is the reason why we quote above the approximate values of the parameters without uncertainties .",
    "however , neither of these caveats is crucial and could be overcome to improve such analysis .",
    "if we ignore these complications , e.g. , assume that the abundance used in the model is correct , then the minimal @xmath31 is achieved for @xmath32 ( scattering angle @xmath2110 ) and , at @xmath290% confidence , @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the cloud is located @xmath34  pc further away from us than sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "we note that this result agrees well with the position estimate obtained by @xcite using the completely independent technique , although uncertainties in both approaches are large .",
    "in the previous section we have used detailed monte carlo simulations ( including multiple scatterings ) of an isolated spherical cloud illuminated by a distant steady primary source .",
    "we now would like to allow for a more elaborate geometry of the gas distribution and include variability of the primary source .    as the first step we note that for neutral gas with solar ( or super - solar ) abundance of heavy elements , the photoelectric absorption cross section is larger than the scattering cross section at energies below @xmath210  kev .",
    "this means that the role of multiple scatterings is subdominal in this energy range for any value of the optical depth .",
    "indeed , in the limiting case of a small optical depth , the probability of an additional scattering is simply proportional to @xmath35 . in the opposite limit of an optical thick medium ,",
    "the probability of the scattering is set by the ratio of the scattering cross section @xmath36 to the total cross section @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the photoelectric absorption cross section . since this ratio is small ( for energies lower than @xmath210  kev ) , the probability of an additional scattering is also small . as a simple illustration we show in fig .",

    "[ sec : modela ] ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_ma ] , left panel ) and the contribution to these spectra from the photons , scattered only once ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is clear that except for the compton shoulder to the left from the iron fluorescent line , the single - scattering approximation works well over the entire 2 - 10 kev range .",
    "the calculation of the reflected spectra , their variability and polarisation properties is straightforward in the single - scattering approximation .",
    "below we use this approximation to compute maps and variability of the reflected component in the entire gc region .      to simulate the properties of the reflected emission in the gc region , we need a model of the 3d distribution of the gas in this region .",
    "large sets of high - quality sub - mm , ir and molecular data are available for the central 1 region around the galactic center owing to its extensive surveying in recent years @xcite . still , these data are capable of providing position - position - velocity ( ppv ) information at best , so one has to assume some ppv vs. 3d position correspondence in order to fully reconstruct 3d distribution of the dense gas .",
    "several models have been put forward to describe the observed ( rather complicated ) ppv - distribution of the gas in the region of interest in a concise and physically motivated way , such as the twisted ring-model proposed by @xcite on base of the _ herschel _ hi - gal survey , or the orbital solution by @xcite [ for a thorough comparison of these models with the data provided by various gas tracers see @xcite ] . here",
    "we adopt the model of @xcite as a baseline .",
    "although all such models are perhaps too simplistic for comprehensive description of the gas distribution , it is well - suited for our purpose , namely to get characteristic values of the expected reflected component fluxes and polarization degrees over the central 1 region around the galactic center .    in order to estimate the actual gas density along the path described by the orbital solution of @xcite ,",
    "this solution was used in conjunction with the cs ( 1 - 0 ) data by @xcite .",
    "namely , we extracted the cells from the @xcite data cube , which falls sufficiently close to the ppv trajectory of @xcite , i.e. that the maximum projected distance of a cell to the trajectory is not more than 2 arcmin and the maximum difference along the velocity axis is 10 km / s . every cell extracted in this way",
    "was treated as a spherical cloud with diameter equal to the cell width in sky projection , whilst its total h@xmath39 mass is calculated according to the standard conversion procedure described in section 4.2 of @xcite ( namely , the fractional abundance of cs molecule is adopted at x(cs)=@xmath40 level and the excitation temperature @xmath41 k ) . in order to eliminate gridding effects , additional gaussian scatter of the cloud positions was applied . on top of this",
    ", we separately added the sgr b2 cloud , since the cs emission as a density tracer becomes increasingly less accurate for that massive molecular clouds as a result of self - attenuation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , detailed density distribution inside the sgr b2 cloud can be reconstructed by means of less optically thick tracers along with radiative transfer simulations @xcite . for the purpose of the current study , however , the finest sub - structures are not very important , since only a small fraction of the total mass ( @xmath21% ) is associated with them .",
    "moreover , the reflected signal from them is additionally weakened since they are typically embedded in larger shells of less dense gas ( see e.g. a schematic fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we implemented only low and moderate density envelopes , and sgr b2 north , main and south cores as described in the table b.3 of @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the sgr b2 complex included in our calculation is @xmath42 , while the total mass of the molecular gas extracted along the trajectory of @xcite is @xmath43 .",
    "we note here that only a fraction ( @xmath44 ) of the total molecular gas in cmz ( @xmath45 , @xcite ) has been accounted for by this procedure . in the base - line model the sgr  b2 cloud is placed at the same distance as sgr  a@xmath1 .",

    "a more accurate estimate of the reflected emission and the degree of polarization can be easily obtained in the single - scattering approximation by calculating the expected spectra . for this purpose",

    "since we expect the emission in these lines to be unpolarized , it does not make sense to use the energy range 6 - 7.5 kev when searching for polarized emission .",
