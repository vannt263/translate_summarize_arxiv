    "graph states @xcite are fundamental in quantum information , especially in quantum error correction @xcite and measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "graph states also play a fundamental role in the study of entanglement .",
    "two quantum states have the same entanglement if they are equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) . for @xmath6 , there are six classes under slocc @xcite . for @xmath7",
    "the number of classes under slocc is infinite and is specified by an exponentially increasing number of parameters .",
    "however , if we focus on graph states of @xmath8 qubits , then the discussion becomes simpler . on one hand ,",
    "every two graph states which are slocc equivalent are also equivalent under local unitary ( lu ) operations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , previous results suggest that , for graph states of @xmath8 qubits , the notion of lu equivalence and local clifford equivalence ( lc equivalence ) coincide .",
    "the `` lu@xmath9lc conjecture '' states that `` every two lu - equivalent stabilizer states must also be lc equivalent . ''",
    "_ proved that the lu@xmath9lc conjecture is false @xcite .",
    "however , the lu@xmath9lc is true for several classes of @xmath0 qubit graph states @xcite and the simplest counterexamples to the conjecture are graph states of @xmath10 qubits @xcite . indeed , ji _ et al . _",
    "`` believe that @xmath11 is the smallest possible size of counterexamples of lu@xmath9lc . '' in this paper we assume that deciding whether or not two graph states of @xmath8 qubits have the same entanglement is equivalent to deciding whether or not they are lc equivalent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to solve the following problem . given an @xmath0-qubit graph state with @xmath12 qubits , decide which entanglement class it belongs to just by examining some of the state s intrinsic properties ( i.e. , without generating the whole lc class ) .",
    "the solution to this problem is of practical importance . if one needs to prepare a graph state @xmath13 and knows that it belongs to one specific class , then one can prepare @xmath13 by preparing the lc - equivalent state @xmath14 requiring the minimum number of entangling gates and the minimum preparation depth of that class ( see @xcite ) and then transform @xmath14 into @xmath13 by means of simple one - qubit unitary operations .",
    "the problem is that , so far , we do not know a simple set of invariants which distinguishes between all classes of entanglement , even for graph states with @xmath15 qubits .",
    "the classification of graph states entanglement has been achieved , up to @xmath3 qubits , by hein , eisert , and briegel ( heb ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and has recently been extended to @xmath16 qubits @xcite .",
    "the criteria for ordering the classes in @xcite are based on several entanglement measures : the minimum number of two - qubit gates required for the preparation of a member of the class , the schmidt measure for the @xmath0-partite split ( which measures the genuine @xmath0-party entanglement of the class @xcite ) , and the schmidt ranks for all bipartite splits ( or rank indexes @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is that this set of entanglement measures fails to distinguish between inequivalent classes ( i.e. , between different types of entanglement ) .",
    "there is already an example of this problem in @xmath3 : none of these entanglement measures allows us to distinguish between the classes 40 , 42 , and 43 in @xcite .",
    "a similar problem occurs in @xmath16 : none of these entanglement measures allows us to distinguish between classes 110 and 111 , between classes 113 and 114 , and between classes 116 and 117 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not use these invariants for deciding which entanglement class a given state belongs to .",
    "reciprocally , if we have such a set of invariants , then we can use it to unambiguously label each of the classes .",
    "van den nest , dehaene , and de moor ( vdd ) proposed a finite set of invariants that characterizes all classes @xcite .",
    "however , already for @xmath3 , this set has more than @xmath17 invariants which are not explicitly calculated anywhere , so this set is not useful for classifying a given graph state .",
    "indeed , vdd `` believe that [ their set of invariants ] can be improved if not for all stabilizer states then at least for some interesting subclasses of states '' @xcite .",
    "moreover , they state that `` it is likely that only [ some ] invariants need to be considered in order to recognize lc equivalence '' @xcite , and that `` it is not unlikely that there exist smaller complete lists of invariants which exhibit less redundancies '' @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that , if @xmath5 , then four invariants are enough to recognize the type of entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce some basic concepts of the graph state formalism and review some of the results about the invariants proposed by vdd that will be useful in our discussion . in sec . [ sec4 ] we present our results and in sec .",

    "the pauli group @xmath18 on @xmath0 qubits consists of all @xmath19 @xmath0-fold tensor products of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an overall phase factor and @xmath22 is either the @xmath23 identity matrix @xmath24 or one of the pauli matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "an @xmath0-qubit stabilizer @xmath28 in the pauli group is defined as an abelian subgroup of @xmath18 which does not contain the operator @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "a stabilizer consists of @xmath30 hermitian ( therefore , they must have real overall phase factors @xmath31 ) @xmath0-qubit pauli operators @xmath32 for some @xmath33 . we will call the operators @xmath34 stabilizing operators .    in group theory , a set of elements @xmath35 in a group @xmath36 is said to generate the group @xmath36 if every element of @xmath36 can be written as a product of elements from @xmath37 .",
    "the notation @xmath38 is commonly used to describe this fact , and the set @xmath39 is called the generator of @xmath36 .",

    ", independent means that no product of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 yields the identity except when all @xmath45 . as a consequence ,",
    "removing any operator @xmath46 from the generator makes the generated group smaller .    by definition , given a stabilizer @xmath28 , the stabilizing operators @xmath34 commute , so that they can be diagonalized simultaneously and , therefore , share a common set of eigenvectors that constitute a basis of the so - called vector space @xmath47 stabilized by @xmath28 .",
    "the vector space @xmath47 is of dimension @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "remarkably , if @xmath50 , then there exists a unique common eigenstate @xmath51 on @xmath0 qubits with eigenvalue @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 for every stabilizing operator @xmath54 .",
    "such a state @xmath51 is called a stabilizer state because it is the only state that is fixed ( stabilized ) by every operator of the stabilizer @xmath28 .",
    "graph states are a special kind of stabilizer states ( with @xmath55 ) associated with graphs .",
    "it has been demonstrated that every stabilizer state is equivalent under local complementation ( defined below ) to some ( generally non unique ) graph state @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-qubit graph state @xmath13 is a pure state associated to a graph @xmath56 consisting of a set of @xmath0 vertices @xmath57 and a set of edges @xmath58 connecting pairs of vertices , @xmath59 .",
    "each vertex represents a qubit . the graph @xmath36 provides a mathematical characterization of @xmath13 .",
    "the graph state @xmath13 associated to the graph @xmath36 is the unique @xmath0-qubit state fulfilling @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the generators of the state s stabilizer group , defined as the set @xmath62 of all products of the generators .",

    "two @xmath0-qubit states , @xmath70 and @xmath51 , have the same @xmath0-partite entanglement if and only if there are @xmath0 one - qubit unitary transformations @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 . if these one - qubit unitary transformations belong to the clifford group , then the two states are said to be lc equivalent .",
    "vdd found that the successive application of a transformation with a simple graphical description is enough to generate the complete equivalence class of graph states under local unitary operations within the clifford group ( hereafter simply referred to as class or orbit ) @xcite .",
    "this simple transformation is local complementation .    on the stabilizer , local complementation on the qubit @xmath63 induces the map @xmath73 on the qubit @xmath63 and the map @xmath74 on the qubits @xmath65 connected with @xmath63 @xcite . on the generators , local complementation on the qubit",
    "@xmath63 maps the generators @xmath75 , with @xmath65 connected with @xmath63 to @xmath76 .",
    "graphically , local complementation on qubit @xmath63 acts as follows .",
    "those vertices connected with @xmath63 which were connected from each other become disconnected from each other and vice versa .",
    "an example is in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "let @xmath51 be a stabilizer state and @xmath81 the corresponding stabilizer . given a stabilizing operator @xmath82 , its support @xmath83 is the set of all @xmath84 such that @xmath85 differs from the identity .",
    "therefore , the support of @xmath34 is the set of the labels of the qubits on which the action of the pauli matrices is non trivial ( i.e. , there is a @xmath86 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 pauli matrix acting on the qubit ) .",
    "notice that the support is preserved under the maps induced on the stabilizer by local complementation ( see sec .",
    "[ localcomplementation ] ) .",
    "let @xmath89 be the support of a stabilizing operator @xmath34 , @xmath90 .",

    "the identity operator @xmath92 , which is always present in a stabilizer due to the underlying group structure , fulfills @xmath93 and , therefore , is of weight zero .",
    "the set of operators @xmath94 of a stabilizer @xmath28 can be classified into equivalence classes according to their supports , defining a partition in the stabilizer .",
    "we will say that two stabilizing operators @xmath34 and @xmath95 of @xmath28 belong to the same equivalence class @xmath96 $ ] if they have the same support @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "we denote by @xmath99 the number of elements ( stabilizing operators ) @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "in other words , @xmath99 is the cardinality of the equivalence class @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "since any graph state @xmath13 is a special type of stabilizer state , these definitions can also be applied to them .",
    "the following theorem is a key result obtained by vdd in @xcite that presents a finite set of invariants which characterizes the lc equivalence class of any stabilizer state ( i.e. , functions that remain invariant under the action of all local clifford transformations ) .",
    "we have chosen an adapted formulation of the theorem to group multiplication involving pauli operators [ see eq .  ] , slightly different from vdd s original notation , which is based on the well - known equivalent formulation of the stabilizer formalism in terms of algebra over the field @xmath102 , where arithmetic is performed modulo @xmath103 and each stabilizing operator is identified with a @xmath104-dimensional binary index operator .",

    "denote @xmath110 and let @xmath111 be the set consisting of all tuples @xmath112 satisfying @xmath113 then , ( i ) @xmath114 is lc invariant and ( ii ) the lc equivalence class of @xmath51 is completely determined by the values of all invariants @xmath115 ( i.e. , where @xmath116 ) .",
    "vdd provide another family of support - related invariants , based on a second theorem with the same formulation than the one above , except for the substitution of conditions by new constraints @xmath117 these new lc invariants are the dimensions of certain vector spaces and , in principle , are more manageable from a computational point of view because they involve the generator matrix of the stabilizer and rank calculation .",
    "nevertheless , we will focus our attention on the first family of invariants , since they suffice to solve the problem we address in this paper with no extra computational effort . to resort to the second family",
    "would be justified in case we had to use invariants with a high @xmath118 value to achieve lc discrimination among graph states up to eight qubits .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a proof of theorem  1 and the extension to the second family of lc invariants .",
    "the invariants of theorem  1 are the cardinalities of certain subsets @xmath111 of @xmath119 , which are defined in terms of simple constraints on the supports of the stabilizing operators .",
    "vdd pointed out that , for @xmath120 , these invariants count the number of operators in the stabilizer with a prescribed support .",
    "therefore , fixing @xmath120 , for every possible support @xmath121 , there is an invariant latexmath:[\\[\\label{inv r1 }    is , the invariants for @xmath120 are the @xmath123 , i.e. , the cardinalities of the equivalence classes @xmath124 $ ] of the stabilizer .",
    "the number of possible supports in a stabilizer of an @xmath0-qubit state is equal to @xmath125 and , therefore , there are @xmath125 vdd s invariants for @xmath120 .",
    "many of them could be equal to zero .",
    "in fact , when dealing specifically with graph states , it can be easily seen that @xmath126 when referred to supports fulfilling @xmath127 because stabilizing operators of weight  1 are not present in the stabilizer of a graph state due to the inherent connectivity of the graphs associated to the states that rules out isolated vertices .",
    "on the other hand , vdd consider the invariants @xmath123 as `` local versions '' of the so - called weight distribution of a stabilizer , a concept frequently used in classical and quantum coding theory .",
    "for @xmath128 , the new series of invariants involve @xmath118-tuples of stabilizing operators and their corresponding supports and constitute a generalization of the weight distribution .",
