    "the second term , continuous spectrum , is not positive ( non - negative ) because of the factor @xmath118 , which is exactly the same one as appeared in .",
    "the fact that the positivity of the spectral density breaks down is an indirect but strong circumstantial evidence that the overlap boson system does not define a quantum mechanical system with physically satisfactory energy - momentum spectrum .",

    "this is not the case for the overlap boson .      from the explicit form of the spectral density",

    "one notes that there is the region in the spacial brillouin zone where the spectral density @xmath120 can not become negative .",

    "when the spacial momenta @xmath157 does not belong to @xmath156 , the spectral density @xmath120 has to become negative on the energy interval @xmath170 , where @xmath103 and @xmath171 are determined by @xmath172 since @xmath173 is equivalent to @xmath174 when @xmath175 .",

    "of course this does not change any physical results .",
