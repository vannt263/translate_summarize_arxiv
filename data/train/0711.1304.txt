    "one of the main features of malignant brain cancer is the ability of tumor cells to invade the normal tissue away from the multi - cell tumor core .",
    "invasion of healthy tissue by a solid tumor ( the core ) , and the role of oxygen and nutrient delivery have been the subject of extensive studies reflected in modern surveys , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "experimental data for a glioma cancer show that the proliferation rate of migratory cells is lower in the invasion region than in the core .",
    "it turns out that the proliferation and migration of cells are mutually exclusive : the high motility suppresses cell proliferation and vice versa .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the _ migration - proliferation dichotomy _ @xcite .",
    "the exact mechanism of switching between the two phenotypes of glioma cells is not known .",
    "there are several phenomenological models for this dichotomy .",
    "one can assume that the diffusion coefficient of cancer cells is a decreasing function of cell density @xcite .",
    "as a result the cancer cell motility is greater in the invasion zone because of the small density of cells there .",
    "one can also assume the dependence of the proliferation term on cell density such that the proliferation rate increases with density @xcite .",
    "an interesting dynamical model for the phenotype switch was suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , this mathematical model involves many parameters , some of which are difficult to estimate .",
    "recently the authors proposed a stochastic approach for the proliferation - migration switching that involves only two parameters @xcite .",
    "the transport process was formulated in the framework of the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "the main reason for employing the ctrw model was to give the mesoscopic description of cancer cell motility in terms of the random jump distribution and waiting times .",
    "one of the main purposes was to take into account anomalous transport ( subdiffusion ) leading to slow motility of cancer cells in the invasive zone . among all possible cancer cell genotypes , leading to six main alternations of malignant growth @xcite ,",
    "cell motility and invasion are most important for our consideration .",
    "the standard diffusion approximation for the transport ( which is the parabolic limit of kinetics ) together with a logistic growth yields an overestimation of the overall growth @xcite . since the motility is the most critical feature of brain cancer , causing treatment failure , there is a need for a proper description of cancer cell motility beyond the standard diffusion approximation . in this connection , the hyperbolic limit of the multi - cellular microscopic system is important @xcite to take into account cellular interaction in the description of macroscopic dynamics .",
    "a very interesting agent - based model was developed  recently by mansury and deisboeck @xcite .",
    "the transport process is described in terms of the local - search mechanism performed by tumor cells .",
    "the purpose of this `` conscious '' search is to find and then invade the most permissive location in extracellular matrix .",
    "a simplified scheme of migration  proliferation dichotomy in terms of ctrw was considered in @xcite .",
    "it involves two steps : cell fission with the characteristic time @xmath0 and cell transport with duration @xmath1 . during the time scale @xmath0 ,",
    "the cells interact strongly and motility of the cells is small . during the time",
    "@xmath1 , interaction between the cells is weak and motility of the cells is determined by a `` jump '' length @xmath2 .",
    "cell invasion is a very complex process controlled by matrix adhesion ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "it involves several steps including receptor - mediated adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , matrix degradation by tumor - secreted proteases ( proteolysis ) , detachment from ecm adhesion sites , and active invasion into intercellular space created by protease degradation .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to give a description of this complicated cell transport in terms of a non - symmetrical random walk model with memory effects .",
    "chemotaxis and haptotaxis are taken into account by the biased random walk of cells that respond to external signals without alteration and migrate away from the tumor core .",
    "effects are modelled by using the heavy - tailed waiting time distributions that lead to subdiffusion of tumor cells .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the migration and proliferation of glioma cells in the framework of a two - component continuous time random walk with proliferation .",
    "the paper is an essential extension of our letter @xcite with new results and examples .",
    "based on experimental observations of _ migration - proliferation dichotomy _ , we assume that the process of tumor cell invasion consists of two states . in state @xmath3 ( migratory phenotype ) the cells randomly move but there is no cell proliferation . in state @xmath4",
    "( proliferating phenotype ) the cancer cells do not migrate and only proliferation takes place . to describe the random switching between the two phenotypes",
    ", we employ the two - state markov chain model .",
    "the cell of type @xmath3 remains in state @xmath3 during a waiting time @xmath5 and then switches to a cell of type @xmath4 . after a waiting time @xmath6 , spent in state @xmath4 ,",
    "it switches back to a cell of type @xmath3 .",
    "both waiting times @xmath5 and @xmath6 are mutually independent random variables exponentially distributed with parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 here the parameters @xmath10 are the switching rates , namely , @xmath11 is the switching rate from state @xmath3 to @xmath4 , while @xmath8 determines the transition rate @xmath12 .",
    "note that the generalization for the renovation processes with arbitrary probability densities for switching times is straightforward .",
    "an important feature of the present analysis is an observation of the influence of the migration - proliferation dichotomy on the overall invasion rate of cancer cells . in what follows",
    "we show how the overall propagation rate @xmath13 depends on the parameters @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the growing tumor spheroid consisting of the tumor core with a high density of cells and the outer invasive zone where the cell density is much smaller . to describe the cancer cells of the two phenotypes we introduce the density of the cells of migrating phenotype , @xmath14 , and the density of the cells of proliferating phenotype , @xmath15 .",
    "the balance equations for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the joint probability density function of making a jump * *  * * @xmath19 in the time interval @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes the integration is over @xmath23-dimensional space .",
    "the one dimensional case ( @xmath24 ) was considered in @xcite .",
    "cell migration ( random jumps ) involves a receptor - mediated adhesion to matrix proteins , matrix degradation by proteases , detachment from adhesion sites , active invasion into `` new '' intercellular space formed by degradation , etc .",
    "it would be extremely difficult to build up a rigorous deterministic model for this process .",
    "since these factors are too many , we believe that a good alternative to such a model is a random walk with memory effects .",
    "the active mechanism of migration of tumor cells involves small random jumps and delay time between jumps .",
    "the latter might be of the same order as the proliferation time .",
    "this dynamics is obviously random and its distribution is given by the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath18 is the joint pdf .    equation ( [ n1 ] ) is the conservation law for cells of type @xmath3 at time @xmath27 at position @xmath28 the first term on the right hand side @xmath29 represents cells of type @xmath3  that stay up to time @xmath27 at position @xmath30 such that no jump occurred , and no switch took place .",

    "note that the exponential factor @xmath33 is the probability that cells of phenotypes @xmath34 do not switch until time @xmath27 .",
    "the independence of the random jumps and switching gives us the probability @xmath35 while the first factor @xmath36 is the initial density of cells of type @xmath3 at @xmath30 .",
    "the second term @xmath37 gives us the number of cells of type @xmath3 arriving at @xmath30 up to time @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the following random mechanism of migration : the cell of type @xmath3 at time @xmath38 at position @xmath39 waits a random time @xmath20 before jumping a distance @xmath19 at position @xmath30 and remains a cell of type @xmath3 .",
    "the last term @xmath40 represents the number of cells of type @xmath4 that switch to the cell of type @xmath3 up to time @xmath27 and remain the cells of type @xmath3 ( the factor @xmath41 ) .",
    "it also takes into account the fact that if transition @xmath12 happens at time @xmath38 , then no jump takes place during the remaining time @xmath20 ( the factor @xmath42 ) .    equation ( [ n2 ] )",
    "describes the balance of cells of proliferating phenotype ( no jumps ) .",
    "the first term on the right hand side , @xmath43 , is the density of cells of type @xmath4  that stay up to time @xmath27 at position @xmath30 such that no switch @xmath12 takes place .",
    "the second term on the right hand side @xmath44 is the proliferation rate for cell of type @xmath4 , which occurs providing that no switch takes place up to time @xmath27 .",
    "the last term @xmath45 gives the number of cell of type @xmath3 switching to the state @xmath4 over the time interval @xmath46 .",
    "it is well known that the ctrw modelling is a standard technique for studying anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "we employ this technique to take into account subdiffusion that leads to slow motility of cancer cells in the invasive zone . in this paper",
    "each random step of a cancer cell is characterized by a waiting time @xmath20 and a jump * *  * * @xmath19 which are distributed according to the joint pdf @xmath47 .",
    "this pdf can be written in a decoupled form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is waiting time pdf and @xmath50 is the pdf of cell jumps .",
    "this form corresponds to the case when the random waiting time and the individual displacement are independent .",
    "the subdiffusion regime occurs when the mean waiting time @xmath51 is infinite and the spherically symmetrical pdf @xmath52 has a finite variance @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the spheroid .",
    "if the asymptotic behavior for the waiting - time density @xmath55 @xmath56 for  large @xmath57 is @xmath58 with @xmath59 , the mean waiting time @xmath60 is infinite and the mean - square displacement @xmath61 corresponds to subdiffusion @xcite . when @xmath60 is finite , there is normal diffusion : the mean - square displacement is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 for the three - dimensional case ( @xmath64 ) .",
