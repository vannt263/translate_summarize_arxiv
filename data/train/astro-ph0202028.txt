    "the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in most galaxies is now becoming a generally accepted fact  @xcite .",

    "the rapid orbital motions of the stars in the cluster surrounding sgr  a@xmath0 in the milky way require the stabilizing gravitational attraction of a dark object with a mass of about @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this , though , is near the lower end of the empirical mass distribution of supermassive galactic black holes .",
    "the black hole masses , the largest of which exceed @xmath2 , correlate with the luminosity of the elliptical - galaxy - like bulge part of the host galaxy and with the average line - of - sight random velocity ( `` velocity dispersion '' ) of the stars in the host galaxy .",
    "this indictes a correlation between black hole mass and galaxy mass and is interpreted as a hint to a direct connection between galaxy formation and black hole fueling  @xcite .",
    "smbhs with masses of a million to a few billion solar masses are believed to be the engines that power active galactic nuclei ranging from faint , compact radio sources to quasars that are brighter than the whole galaxy in which they live .",
    "the detection of quasars with redshifts larger than 6 requires that these objects were formed only several hundred million years after the big bang .",
    "the growth of black holes by accretion is exponential , @xmath3 , with a timescale @xmath4 years , where @xmath5 is the radiation efficiency of the accreting black hole and @xmath6 is the ratio of the luminosity @xmath7 to the eddington luminosity .",
    "therefore smbhs with @xmath8@xmath9 solar masses need at least 1020 e - foldings to assemble by accretion on seed black holes of 10@xmath101000@xmath11 , which might be the compact remnants of an early generation of massive or very massive stars  @xcite .",
    "provided enough gas were available in the surroundings to be swallowed by such a stellar mass black hole , and the efficiency of the black hole to absorb the gas flow were as high as assumed above , the time for its growth by accretion seems marginally short enough to explain the existence of quasars in the early universe .",
    "a consistent and satisfactory picture of the formation process of quasar black holes has not been developed yet  @xcite .",
    "a variety of different routes were suggested ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , including scenarios based on gas hydrodynamics , stellar dynamics , or combinations of both .",
    "primordial gas clouds could collapse directly to smbhs when their fragmentation is inhibited by radiation pressure or magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , when angular momentum plays a role and the cooling timescale is much smaller than the viscous timescale , they might contract to form a supermassive disk  @xcite .",
    "if instead fragmentation of a primordial gas cloud occurred and a dense cluster of stars were born , stellar collisions and mergers might lead to a runaway growth of intermediate - mass black holes ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a dense cluster composed of neutron stars or black holes as the compact remnants of massive stars might be driven by the secular `` gravothermal catastrophe '' to the point of a final relativistic instability that happens on a dynamical timescale  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for arguments against this picture ) .",
    "some of the proposed scenarios are envisioned to lead to the build - up of a supermassive star ( sms ) as an intermediate stage of the evolution before the final gravitational instability sets in and the collapse to a smbh takes place .",
    "further growth of a seed black hole , possibly a smbh , by accretion , could be linked to processes during the formation or evolution of the bulge of a galaxy ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . galaxy formation or interaction could directly result in the black hole feeding that makes quasars shine , and bigger galaxies might be able to provide more fuel .",
    "this might explain why more massive galaxies contain more massive black holes  @xcite .",
    "supermassive stars ( smss ) are equilibrium configurations that are dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "their temperature is low enough that electron - positron pairs do not play a role .",
    "baryons yield only a minor contribution to the equation of state . at some point of their evolution smss collapse due to a general relativistic gravitational instability  @xcite .",
    "smss can have masses between @xmath1010@xmath12 and about @xmath13 .",
    "since they are expected to be fully convective  @xcite ( a formal argument can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , they are isentropic and their structure can be well described by a newtonian polytrope with @xmath14 or @xmath15 . with their specific entropy being nearly constant ,",
    "the adiabatic polytropic constant @xmath16 is roughly equal to the local adiabatic index @xmath17_s$ ] . to good accuracy",
    "the entropy per nucleon in a sms , @xmath18 , is given by the radiation entropy ( in units of boltzmann s constant @xmath19 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass of the star , @xmath22 the density in g@xmath23@xmath24 , and @xmath25 the temperature in k ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "smss with large masses have entropies much higher than typical astrophysical plasmas .",
    "this suggests that dissipative processes ( shocks , cloud - cloud collisions , turbulence ) must be invoked for generating appropriate conditions for the formation of such supermassive equilibrium configurations .    the evolution of smss proceeds on a kelvin - helmholtz timescale and is driven by the loss of energy and entropy through radiation and  in case of rotation being important  the loss of angular momentum , e.g. via mass shedding .",
    "because the pressure is dominated by radiation , the luminosity of smss is close to the eddington limit , @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the thompson cross section and @xmath28 the proton mass .",
    "although plasma corrections ( due to nuclei and electrons ) and general relativistic effects are small , neither of both can be neglected for the evolution of a configuration which is so close to the pathological , i.e. , dynamically marginally stable , case of a @xmath29 polytrope ( for a discussion , see ref .",
    "pressure contributions by plasma components raise the adiabatic index of the equation of state , @xmath30 , to a value above 4/3  @xcite : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the total internal energy density without rest - mass energy , and the second expression is correct to first order in the ratio of the gas pressure to the radiation pressure , @xmath33 .",
    "general relativity leads to the existence of a maximum for the equilibrium mass as a function of the central density for smss with constant entropy .",
    "this implies that general relativistic stars of mass @xmath21 , which are supported both by radiation and gas pressure , have a maximum , i.e. , `` critical '' , central density : @xmath34 for higher central densities the nonlinear effects of gravity have a destabilizing influence to radial perturbations .",
    "the central temperature at the onset of the gravitational instability is @xmath35 and the corresponding equilibrium energy can be found to be @xmath36 which is independent of @xmath21 .",
    "the redshift factor at the surface of a supermassive star ( with radius @xmath37 ) at this point of the evolution is @xmath38 which is in the range @xmath39 ....",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath41 .... @xmath42 and thus indeed very small so that the configuration is much larger than its schwarzschild radius , @xmath43 .",
    "nevertheless , general relativity plays a crucial role for the evolution .    the gravitational instability sets in when the effective adiabatic index of the configuration ( eq .  [ jankaheqgam ] ) drops below a critical value , which is approximately given by @xmath44 @xmath45",
    "is the schwarzschild radius of the star and @xmath46 is the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational potential energy . for @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ jankaheqcrit ] ) becomes @xmath48 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore the gravitational collapse begins when the plasma contribution to the equation of state does not raise the adiabatic index sufficiently above @xmath49 to compensate for the destabilizing influence of general relativity .",
    "the latter grows as the radius of the star shrinks during its evolution .",
    "rotation has a stabilizing effect and can hold up the collapse if @xmath50 if @xmath51 remains a constant during the equilibrium evolution , the final instability is again reached when the relativistic terms become too large .",
    "since the central density and temperature are higher for stars with smaller masses , and both increase during the quasistatic evolution , the creation of electron - positron pairs can be neglected for @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath53k ; eq .",
    "[ jankaheqtemp ] )  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the nuclear energy generation rate with the photon luminosity ( eq .  [ jankaheqlum ] ) shows that nuclear burning is also irrelevant prior to the gravitational instability for smss with masses in excess of a few @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "while radiating energy at its eddington limit , the sms evolves on a timescale @xmath55 with essentially constant mass but decreasing entropy and energy until the critical configuration for the general relativistic instability is reached and the catastrophic collapse sets in . only when the thermal ( kelvin - helmholtz ) timescale is longer than the hydrodynamical timescale , @xmath56 there is an equilibrium phase of the evolution of the supermassive object .",
    "the two timescales become equal ( about 10 years ) for @xmath57 . above this mass",
    "no hydrostatic phase is possible .",
    "more typical smss with @xmath58 have a lifetime of about 1000 years .",
    "since smss are very close to the edge of instability , rotation can appreciably stretch their equilibrium evolution . considering the secular evolution of a uniformly rotating configuration along the mass - shedding sequence , baumgarte and shapiro",
    "@xcite found a lifetime independent of the stellar mass , @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , they showed that the key nondimensional ratios @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the angular momentum ) for a maximally and rigidly rotating @xmath14 polytrope at the onset of radial instability are universal numbers , independent of the mass , spin , radius , or history of the star : @xmath64 with the polar radius @xmath65 being roughly @xmath66 of the equatorial radius @xmath67 .",
    "this deformation reduces the luminosity by about 36% below the usual eddington luminosity of a corresponding nonrotating star  @xcite .",
    "the effects of differential rotation , where mass loss during the quasi - stationary evolution could be ignored , were discussed by new and shapiro  @xcite .",
    "driven by energy loss through radiation and angular momentum loss due to mass shedding , smss contract slowly in a quasi - static manner and approach the point of dynamical instability as a consequence of the increasing effects of general relativity .",
    "the subsequent catastrophic collapse can lead to the formation of a smbh  @xcite or , for sufficiently large initial metallicity , to a violent explosion that is powered by the release of nuclear energy through hydrogen burning in the cno cycle  @xcite .",
    "these events are associated with the emission of gigantic amounts of energy in neutrinos  @xcite , a fact that has nourished speculations that smss collapsing to black holes might be the sources of cosmic gamma - ray bursts  @xcite . in the case of rotationally deformed configurations , which might encounter a dynamical bar mode instability that triggers the growth of nonaxisymmetric bars , the generation of long - wavelength gravitational waves can be expected .",
    "such gravitational waves could be detectable by future space - based laser interferometers like lisa  @xcite .",
    "moreover , smss that were disrupted by explosions might have contributed to the enrichment of the gas in the young universe with elements heavier than helium , in particular of comparatively rare isotopes like @xmath68c , @xmath69n , @xmath70o , and @xmath71ne  @xcite , and in case of smss with high metallicities of @xmath72al  @xcite .",
    "-@xmath25-plane ( @xmath73 is the mean molecular weight ) . initially the photo - neutrino production yields the major contribution to the neutrino loss , during the later phases of the collapse it is the pair annihilation process .",
    "plasmon neutrinos are negligible ]    the last investigation of nuclear burning during the collapse and explosion of smss was undertaken by fuller et al .",
    "they performed hydrodynamical calculations with a post - newtonian approximation to general relativistic gravity , used a detailed equation of state including electron - position pairs , and took into account photon and neutrino losses as well as all nuclear reactions for describing hydrogen burning by the cno cycle ( limited by @xmath74 decays of @xmath75o and @xmath69o ) and by the rapid proton capture ( rp- ) process that characterizes hydrogen burning at very high temperatures ( @xmath76k ; at such temperatures , however , neutrino losses become dominant ) .",
    "considering nonrotating configurations , fuller et al .",
    "@xcite found that stars with a mass @xmath77 and initial metallicities @xmath78 do not explode , whereas objects with @xmath79 ( a value near the solar mass fraction of heavy elements ! ) do explode .",
    "the explosion energies range from @xmath80ergs for stars of mass @xmath81 to @xmath82ergs for @xmath83 , and the photon luminosities can exceed @xmath84ergs@xmath23s@xmath85 for a period of more than ten years .",
    "the nucleosynthesis in exploding smss is characterized by the production of a large amount of @xmath86he and trace amounts of @xmath69n and @xmath87li .",
    "deuterium production turned out to be negligible because this nucleus is too fragile to survive the high temperatures during the explosion of supermassive objects ( see , however , ref .",

    "@xcite have performed simulations in full general relativity of the collapse of nonrotating smss to black holes with the aim to calculate in detail the neutrino ( and antineutrino ) emission of such events until the point when the emission is quickly terminated by the formation of the event horizon .",
