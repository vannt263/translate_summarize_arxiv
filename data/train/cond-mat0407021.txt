    "the existence of vesicles at thermal equilibrium is a long - standing , and still controversial , problem @xcite .",
    "unilamellar and multi - lamellar vesicles ( mlvs ) were first induced in lyotropic lamellar phases with excess water by adding energy ( _ e.g. _ shear flow , ultrasound , electric field ) @xcite . in a very elegant work",
    ", using membranes generated by a chemical reaction , hoffman and co - workers demonstrated that any of lamellae , unilamellar vesicles , or mlvs can be prepared in the same system , depending on the mechanical path chosen @xcite .",
    "however in some special cases @xcite _ equilibrium _ unilamellar vesicles have been demonstrated .",
    "these systems are all in the dilute regime ( large excess of water ) .",
    "some experiments have suggested that mlvs ( or onions ) can be stabilized in the semi - dilute regime ( excess water ) @xcite .",
    "theories to explain the stability of dilute unilamellar vesicles either describe a competition between the entropy of mixing and the curvature energy of the vesicles @xcite or a symmetry - breaking instability leading to a spontaneous curvature @xcite .",
    "onions are also predicted to be stabilized in the dilute and semi - dilute regimes due to an unstable curvature energy ; in these cases , a transition towards unilamellar vesicles is avoided by imposing either a core energy @xcite or a cutoff in the entropy of the helfrich interactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , simons and cates @xcite have discussed the stability of unilamellar vesicles and the transition to onions as the concentration increases even when the curvature energy is unfavorable , due to entropic reasons .    in the concentrated regime ( homogeneous lamellar phase with no excess water ) , very monodisperse onions can be prepared under shear @xcite .",
    "the vesicles fill space and remain in the one phase region without expelling solvent , by distorting into space - filling polyhedra @xcite .",
    "the resulting texture is a lattice of disclinations which can be either disordered @xcite or ordered @xcite .",
    "moreover many experimental systems `` spontaneously '' exhibit onions in regions of the phase diagrams that seem to be continuously linked to the lamellar phase @xcite .",
    "this evolution from a texture of polydisperse vesicles to a texture of focal conics upon tuning a parameter , such as a co - surfactant concentration or the volume fraction of solvent , seems to be generic .",
    "a striking signature of this evolution is the change in the rheology , from a viscous gel in the `` onion '' phase to a more fluid phase in the `` lamellar '' focal conic phase .",
    "thus , whether an onion texture is at equilibrium or not seems yet unclear . in this work",
    "we propose a model based on a non - quadratic elastic energy , which shows that a pure lamellar phase , or one of space - filling deformed monodisperse onions , is unstable with respect to a polydisperse space - filling packing ( we study an apollonian packing @xcite ) .",
    "we compare these predictions to experiments on copolymer - doped lamellar phases , originally introduced by ligoure _",
    "the bending free energy per area @xmath0 for membranes is usually taken , following helfrich , as the simplest quadratic function of the mean and gaussian curvatures , respectively @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two principal radii of curvature @xcite .",
    "this suffices for large curvature radii @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the layer thickness .",
    "however , if onions exist , because of the high concentration of membrane , high curvatures ( small @xmath7 ) are expected near the core of the onions .",
    "we will thus use the free energy , relative to a flat state , of a symmetric bilayer expanded to quartic order in the curvature radii @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the conventional bending and gaussian curvature moduli , and the non - linear moduli @xmath11 can be expected to scale as @xmath12 .",
    "stability of a flat membrane requires @xmath13 . for @xmath14 an instability towards a phase with @xmath15 ( _ e.g. _ a bicontinuous phase ) is possible .",
    "however , for @xmath16 spherical shells are stabilized , with free energy ( for radius @xmath7 ) @xmath17 given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "positive @xmath20 stabilizes spherical shells ( vesicles ) of finite radius .",
    "unilamellar vesicles can not accommodate volume fractions close to space filling , so we consider the free energy of an onion of radius @xmath21 , constructed from @xmath22 shells of discrete radii @xmath23 set by the layer spacing @xmath24 , which we assume remains fixed : @xmath25      \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the balance between the helfrich and non - linear elastic coefficients and @xmath27 . in the limit @xmath28 the second term above , due to the fourth order coefficients , is equivalent to the core energy introduced by fournier and durand @xcite .    for large dilute monodisperse onions the free energy per unit volume scales as @xmath29 , leading for @xmath30 to stable onions with size @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the concentrated regime monodisperse onions can not fill space without non - trivial deformations @xcite .",
    "typically , onions formed under shear pack as polyhedra , with the deformation of layer @xmath32 concentrated along the edges of length @xmath33 with curvatures of order @xmath34 , where the smectic bending penetration length @xmath35 depends on the bending @xmath36 and compression @xmath37 moduli of the lamellar phase @xcite . summing over all shells in a deformed polyhedron leads to an energy per unit volume that scales as @xmath38/(r \\xi d^3)$ ] . for @xmath39 this leads to an unphysical unilamellar vesicle phase with @xmath40 ( the lower cutoff ) .",
    "however , a polydisperse phase can relax the deformation , leading , for a broad enough distribution to a space - filling distribution of spheres .",
    "a candidate space - filling distribution is the apollonian packing , for which the number distribution of spheres @xmath41 , with a fractal dimension estimated from simulations to be @xmath42 @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : app1]c ) .",
    "such a packing has been previously suggested to describe focal conic defects in smectic droplets @xcite . in principal we should calculate this distribution from a free energy that incorporates entropy .",
    "although small on the typical scale of the elastic terms , this entropy should widen the parameter range in which onions are stable @xcite .",
    "existing equations of state for , _",
    "e.g. _ polydisperse hard spheres , fail for widely disperse distributions near space filling @xcite , so we have been unable to estimate this contribution to any useful accuracy .",
    "entropic effects will most likely influence the upper and lower cutoffs of the distribution , and would eventually lead ( for highly fluctuating systems ) to an exponential , rather than power law , size distribution away from space filling @xcite .    , as a function of @xmath26 .",

    "although spherical shells are stable for @xmath30 , the stabilizing elastic constants @xmath11 assure that a finite and negative @xmath54 is required for onion formation .",
    "onions are first stable with ` infinite radius ' , implying a smooth transition from lamellae to onions .",
