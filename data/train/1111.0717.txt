    "each single - electron orbit ( distincted by the quantum numbers @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath50 ) is four - fold degenerate due to the spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , at most two electrons in quartet can stay in the same single - electron orbit , while all the three electrons in doublets can stay in the same one .",
    "this gives rise to the difference between energy spectrum of the `` m '' and `` @xmath79 '' valley configurations .",
    "interestingly , we find that the magnetic - field independent degeneracy between quartet and doublet can exists in the `` m '' valley configuration .",

    "this corresponds the decrease of the interdot coupling .",
    "differently , the valley energies of the lowest two subbands present oscillation against the barrier width , which can be expected from the formula given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "since the intersubband coupling due to the valley - orbit coupling is much weaker than the intersubband splitting from the orbital degree of freedom , we neglect this term in our calculation .",
    "actually , the first subband dominates the lowest few states because of the large intersubband splitting ( @xmath207  mev ) in the strong interdot coupling regime studied here .",

    "in summary , we have studied three - electron energy spectra in si / sige single qds and vertically coupled dqds by using the exact - diagonalization method . in our calculation , the zeeman splitting , soc , valley coupling and electron - electron coulomb interaction are explicitly included . due to the strong coulomb interaction , a large number of basis functions",
    "are employed to converge the energy spectrum .",
    "the ground state energies in single qds show good agreement with the experiment . as a supplement of the experimental data , we identify the valley configuration , spin configuration and the degeneracy factor of the ground state from our calculation .",
    "we then systematically study the ground state configuration in the absence of magnetic field , and find that the ground state is of pure and mixed valley configurations with large and small valley splittings , respectively .",
    "we show that the ground state with mixed valley configuration is always doublet .",
    "in contrast , the ground state with pure valley configuration is doublet in small dots , while it can be quartet in large dots .",
    "then , we explicitly study the energy spectra of the three - electron states with two typical valley configurations , i.e. , pure and mixed valley states , in the presence of perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields . in the pure valley configuration case ,",
    "we show that the doublet - quartet transition of the ground state can be realized by tuning the magnetic field and/or dot size . for the mixed valley configuration",
    ", the doublet - quartet transition of the ground state can also be realized by magnetic field and the three - electron energy spectrum presents interesting quartet - doublet degeneracy , which is connected with the negligible intervalley coupling .",
    "due to the spin - orbit coupling , the intersecting points between the energy levels with identical valley configuration but different spin quantum numbers can present anticrossing behavior , which is expected to benefit the manipulation of spin .",
    "we point out and analyze all these anticrossing points in each case .",
    "furthermore , we study the barrier - width and barrier - height dependences of the three - electron energy spectrum in vertically strong - coupled dqds .",

    "and the spin - orbit coupling is very weak compared with the orbital energy and coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , one can denote each state ( except in the vicinity of the anticrossing points ) by the total orbital angular momentum .",
    "here we take @xmath263 and @xmath264 for the permutation antisymmetric or symmetric characters of the orbital part of the basis functions for the electrons `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' . even though , the identity among the three electrons is still guaranteed by the orthogonality and completeness of the entire hilbert space ."

    "<S> we identify the spin and valley configurations of the ground state in the experimental cases and give a complete phase - diagram - like picture of the ground state configuration with respect to the dot size and valley splitting . </S>",
    "<S> we also explicitly investigate the three - electron energy spectra of the pure and mixed valley configurations with magnetic fields in both faraday and voigt configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ground state can be switched between doublet and quartet by tuning the magnetic field and/or dot size . </S>",
    "<S> the three - electron energy spectra present many anticrossing points between different spin states due to the spin - orbit coupling , which are expected to benefit the spin manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the negligibly small intervalley coulomb interaction can result in magnetic - field independent quartet - doublet degeneracy in the three - electron energy spectrum of the mixed valley configuration . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the barrier - width and barrier - height dependences in vertically coupled double quantum dots with both pure and mixed valley configurations . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the single quantum dot case , anticrossing behavior and quartet - doublet degeneracy are observed . </S>"
