    "these solar - type multiple systems ( table  [ tab : objects ] ) are relatively young , as inferred from chromospheric activity ( all are x - ray sources ) and the presence of lithium .",
    "the first two objects were identified as sb3s by @xcite in a spectroscopic follow - up of _ rosat_. the wide common - proper - motion ( cpm ) pair hip 113579 and 113597 belongs to the ab doradus association @xcite ; its fainter component is the sb3 . in all four sb3s ,",

    "sections 3 to 6 are devoted to the individual systems and follow the same template : bibliography , orbits , and estimation of component s parameters . in section 7 , the results are used to discuss the mass - luminosity relation , strength of the lithium line , and origin of hierarchical triple - lined systems .",
    "the last section 8 summarizes the paper .",
    "most spectra used here were taken with the 1.5-m telescope located at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile and operated by the smarts consortium . the observing time was allocated through noao ( programs",
    "14b-0009 , 15a-0055 , 15b-0012 ) .",
    "the observations were made with the fiber - fed echelle spectrograph chiron @xcite by the telescope operators in service mode .",
    "the spectra taken in the slicer mode have a resolution of @xmath2 and a signal to noise ratio of at least 20 .",
    "they cover the range from 415 nm to 880 nm in 53 orders .",
    "thorium - argon calibrations were recorded for each target . a few spectra taken in 2010 at the same telescope with the fiber echelle ( fech ) with a resolution of @xmath3 @xcite are used here , too .",
    "most ( but not all ) individual rvs are published in @xcite , where preliminary orbital periods are also announced .",
    "the reduced and wavelength - calibrated spectra delivered by the chiron pipeline were retrieved from the smarts center at the yale university .",
    "the availability of this service has greatly enhanced this program by allowing rapid analysis of the rvs and flexible scheduling of new observations when needed .",
    "the spectra were cross - correlated with the digital binary mask ( template ) based on the solar spectrum stored in the noao archive ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",

    "spectroscopic measurements of [ fe / h ] could have been biased by the unrecognized multiplicity .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lithium line in hip 7601 and hip 23824 are comparable to the stars of similar color in the hyades @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hyad ] , suggesting an age of @xmath120.6gyr .",
    "however , large scatter of lithium abundance and activity indicators among stars in the hyades makes this estimate rather uncertain .",
    "the lithium line in hip 13498 is stronger than in the hyades , although the system may belong to this group kinematically .    the components of both hip  7601 and 13498 have slow axial rotation ranging from 1.8 to 4.3 km  s@xmath6 , as inferred from the width of their ccfs .",
    "assuming that components of the inner subsystems are synchronized and aligned with the orbits , i estimate projected synchronous velocities of 2.0 and 2.7 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "they are close to the actual @xmath150 of the secondary components ab , 1.8 and 2.8 km  s@xmath6 in hip 7601 and 13498 , respectively . the primary components aa and the visual secondaries b rotate slightly faster .",
    "if the lines are broadened by additional factors , compared to the sun , the above estimates are upper limits . in the closest inner binary hip 23824 aa , ab",
    ", the synchronous speed of aa , estimated at @xmath151 km  s@xmath6 , matches its measured rotation of 7.1 km  s@xmath6 , while b rotates much slower at @xmath152 km  s@xmath6 .      by definition ,",
    "triple - lined systems have all three components of comparable masses and luminosities .",
    "if their components were chosen randomly from the stellar mass function , sb3s would be exceptionally rare .",
    "the four nearby sb3s studied here do not appear exceptional , demonstrating that stars of similar masses are commonly assembled together in hierarchical systems .",
    "it is legitimate to ask how these objects were formed , given that the initial size of a solar - mass protostellar core , on the order of the jeans length ( @xmath153 au ) , is much larger than the size of those multiples .",
    "it is currently believed that binaries forming by fragmentation of cores or circumstellar disks have relatively large initial separations , no less than @xmath1250 au , owing to the opacity limit to fragmentation @xcite .",
    "subsequent accretion shrinks the binary , while its components grow in mass . the binary separation decreases roughly as @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the secondary grows faster than the primary , naturally leading to close pairs of comparable - mass stars .",
    "to explain the origin of a hierarchical sb3 , we have to admit that the inner pair formed first and became closer , while the outer component formed later .",
    "if this triple system later gained a substantial mass and this mass was accreted preferentially by the distant companion , one expects that the former tertiary would become nearly as massive as the close pair , converting itself into a primary .",
    "such triple systems indeed are common ( e.g. @xmath155  for , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the case of sb3s the growth of the outer component had to be regulated in such a way that all three stars end up with similar masses .",
    "the challenge of explaining the formation of sb3s may lead to new insights on star formation in general .",
    "all four systems studied here are structured in a similar way , with an inner spectroscopic pair and a tertiary companion .",
    "the orbits of those tertiaries , however , have quite different periods ranging from 1.75  yr to @xmath12500  yrs . in three systems",
    "the inclinations of the inner orbits are close to the inclinations of the outer orbits , suggesting co - planarity .",
    "the inner orbit in the closest triple , hip  7601 , has a small eccentricity of @xmath156 .",
    "this also argues for approximate co - planarity in this system , because otherwise the kozai - lidov cycles @xcite would have increased the inner eccentricity .    on the other hand ,",
    "the inner orbits in hip 13498 and 113597 are moderately eccentric .",
    "the separations at periastron in these inner binaries correspond to equivalent circular orbits with @xmath157 of 7.8 and 8.7 days , respectively .",
    "these periods are shorter than the 10-day circularization period of solar - type stars @xcite , meaning that the components tidally interact at periastron .",
    "the kozai - lidov mechanism can not be ruled out . in any case",
    ", the inner orbits will eventually become circular .",
    "these triple systems are relatively young and still evolve dynamically towards circular inner orbits .",
    "the inner binary in hip  23824 is already circularized .    the triple system hip  7601 holds the record of the shortest outer period ( 639 days ) among the 4847 f- and g - type dwarfs within 67pc of the sun @xcite",
    ". the outer periods of multiple systems in this sample are all longer than @xmath121000 days .",
    "this means that shorter outer periods are rare .",
    "nevertheless , such systems certainly exist .",
    "for example , vw  lmi contains four solar - type stars packed in the outer orbit with a period of only 355 days @xcite .",
    "several triple stars with short outer periods were recently found by @xcite in the _ kepler _ sample of eclipsing binaries .    if the orbit of the tertiary component shrinks , at some point it starts to interact dynamically with the inner pair , even when the orbits are co - planar ( no kozai - lidov cycles ) .",
    "such interaction should start at moderate period ratios ( on the order of a few tens ) and may take the form of mean motion resonances ( integer period ratios ) .",
    "the period ratio in hip  7601 is close ( although not quite equal ) to an integer number .",
    "the ratio of inner periods in the hierarchical quadruple system hd  91962 is also an integer number 19.0 @xcite .",
    "the absence of the dust disk and outer companions to hip  7601 imply that its outer orbit is no longer shrinking .",
    "orbital elements of four hierarchical systems have been determined here , based on the original rvs and complemented by published and new resolved measurements .",
    "all objects are relatively young , as inferred from the chromospheric activity ( x - ray sources ) , presence of lithium , and kinematics .",
    "measurements of masses , luminosities , and rotation give an interesting material for calibrating evolution of solar - type stars and their ages .",
    "the system hip  7601 is most interesting , being the closest , the brightest , and with accurately determined outer orbit and masses .",
    "the accuracy of masses can be further improved by accumulating more data and/or by using better instruments .",
    "the semi - major axis of the inner 19-day subsystem is 6mas , making it an easy target for long - baseline interferometers such as vlti .",
    "only a few observations are needed to establish the relative orbit orientation , confirming or refuting their suggested co - planarity .",
    "new data will also improve the accuracy of the measured masses and period ratio .",
    "i thank the operators of the 1.5-m telescope for executing observations of this program and the smarts team at yale for scheduling and pipeline processing .",

    "<S> each of the nearby triple systems hip 7601 , 13498 , 23824 , and 113597 ( hd 10800 , 18198 , 35877 , 217389 ) consists of solar - type dwarfs with comparable masses , where all three components are resolved spectrally , while the outer pairs are resolved both visually and spectrally . </S>",
    "<S> these stars are relatively young ( between 100 and 600myr ) and chromospherically active ( x - ray sources ) , although they rotate slowly . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic orbits of the inner subsystems ( periods 19.4 , 14.1 , 5.6 , 20.3 days ) and orbits of the outer systems ( periods 1.75 , 51 , 27 , 500 yrs , respectively ) are determined . for hip 7601 and 13498 , </S>",
    "<S> the combined spectro - interferometric outer orbits produce direct measurement of masses of all components , allowing comparison with stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> the 6708  lithium line is present and its strength is measured in each component individually by subtracting the contributions of other components . </S>",
    "<S> the inner and outer orbits of hip 7601 are nearly circular , likely co - planar , and have a modest period ratio of 1:33 . </S>",
    "<S> this study contributes to the characterization of hierarchical multiplicity in the solar neighborhood and provides data for testing stellar evolutionary models and chronology . </S>"
