    "increasing the capacity of a wireless communication system has always been a focus of the wireless communications research community .",
    "it is well - known that polarisation diversity can be exploited to mitigate the multipath effect to maintain a reliable communication link with an acceptable quality of service ( qos ) , where a pair of antennas with orthogonal polaristion directions is employed at both the transmitter and the receiver sides .",
    "however , the traditional diversity scheme aims to achieve a single reliable channel link between the transmitter and the receiver , while the same information is transmitted at the same frequency but with different polarisations , i.e. two channels .",
    "this is not an effective use of the precious spectrum resources as the two channels could be used to transmit different data streams simultaneously .",
    "for example , we can design a four - dimensional ( 4-d ) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels using a quaternion - valued representation , as proposed in @xcite",
    ". an earlier version of quaternion - valued 4-d modulation scheme based on two different frequencies was proposed in @xcite . however , due to the change of polarisation of the transmitted radio frequency signals during the complicated propagation process including multipath , reflection , refraction , etc , interference will be caused to each other at the two differently polarised receiving antennas . to solve the problem ,",
    "efficient signal processing methods and algorithms for channel equalization and interference suppression / beamforming are needed for practical implementation of the proposed 4-d modulation scheme .",
    "recently , quaternion - valued signal processing has been introduced and studied in details to solve problems related to three or four - dimensional signals @xcite , such as vector - sensor array signal processing  @xcite , and wind profile prediction  @xcite .",
    "with most recent developments in this area , especially the derivation of quaternion - valued gradient operators and the quaternion - valued least mean square ( qlms ) algorithm @xcite , we are now ready to effectively solve the 4-d equalisation and interference suppression / beamforming problem associated with the proposed 4-d modulation scheme .",
    "now the dual - channel effect on the transmitted signal can be modeled by a quaternion - valued infinite impulse response ( iir ) or finite impulse response ( fir ) filter . at the receiver side , for channel equalisation",
    ", we can employ a quaternion - valued adaptive algorithm to recover the original 4-d signal , which inherently also performs an interference suppression operation to separate the original two 2-d signals .",
    "moreover , multiple antenna pairs can be employed at the receiver side to perform the traditional beamforming task to suppress other interfering signals .",
    "in particular , two representative quaternion - valued equalisation / beamforming algorithms will be derived : the first one is the quaternion - valued wiener filter as a follow - up to the previously derived qlms algorithm for reference signal based equalisation / beamforming , and the second one is the quaternion - valued constant modulus algorithm ( qcma ) for blind equalisation / beamforming . compared to the summary contribution in @xcite , in addition to the detailed analytical modeling steps , the main difference is the gcma algorithm and the related simulations . although quaternion - valued wireless communication employing multiple antennas has been studied before , such as the design of orthogonal space - time - polarization block code in @xcite , to our best knowledge , it is the first time to study the quaternion - valued equalization and interference suppression / beamforming problem in this context .",
    "moreover , the dual - polarised antenna pair or an array of them has a similar structure to the well - studied vector sensors or sensor arrays @xcite , where they are used mainly for traditional array signal processing applications .",
    "although the recently developed quaternion - valued array signal processing algorithms based on such traditional array applications employed a quaternion - valued array model  @xcite , the desired signals are still traditional complex - valued signals , instead of quaternion - valued communication signals .    in the following , the 4-d modulation scheme based on two orthogonally polarised antennas will be introduced in sec .",

    "in traditional polarisation diversity scheme , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : trantennapair ] , each side is equipped with two antennas with orthogonal polarisation directions and the signal being transmitted is two - dimensional , i.e. complex - valued with one real part and one imaginary part . in the quaternion - valued modulation scheme , the signal is modulated across the two antennas to generate a 4-d modulated signal .",
    "such a signal can be conveniently represented mathematically by a quaternion @xcite .",
    "a quaternion is a hypercomplex number defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the real part of the quaternion , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the three imaginary components with their corresponding imaginary units @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the conjugate of a quaternion , denoted by @xmath8 , is defined as @xmath9 @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy the following conditions @xmath10 as a result , quaternionic multiplications are noncommutative .    as an example , corresponding to the 4-qam ( quadrature amplitude modulation ) in the two - dimensional case , for the 4-d modulation scheme , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can take values of either @xmath11 or @xmath12 , representing @xmath13 different symbols .",
    "we can call this scheme 16-qqam ( quaternion - valued qam ) or 16-@xmath14 .",
    "the signal transmitted by the two antennas will go through the channel with all kinds of effects and arrive at the receiver side , where the two antennas with orthogonal polarisation directions ( note that orthogonal polarisation may not give the best performance for a specific scenario ) will pick up the two signals . again",
    "the four components of the received signal can be represented by another quaternion .",
    "we use @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] to represent the transmitted and received 4-d quaternion - valued signals , respectively",

    "note that the optimum @xmath35 for each channel realization is different and a fixed @xmath35 for all randomly generated channel impulse responses will lead to a much less favorable result , which is why the steady state error is relatively large .",
    "we have also calculated the corresponding bit error rate ( ber ) based on this non - optimum @xmath35 and it is about @xmath97 .    however ,",
    "if we focus on one specific channel response , such as the one given below @xmath98\\ ; ,    \\label{eqn : sim_fc}\\ ] ] where each column gives the four components of the quaternion - valued coefficient of @xmath17 $ ] , and use the same value of @xmath95 , we will be able to achieve a zero ber result , as shown by the scatter plots of constellation before and after equalization in fig .",
    "[ fig : qequal_scatter ] .",
    "since we can not show the 4-d scatter plot directly , we have split it into two 2-d plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : qequal_scatter ] , where the upper row is for the scatter plots before equalization , and the lower row for the plots after equalization .",
    "we can clearly see that the equalization operation has been successful .            in the second set of simulations , we consider a @xmath99 mimo array and the two transmitted quaternion - valued signals have the same normalized power , with an snr of 20 db at the receiver side .",
    "all the other parameters are the same as the first one , except that now the step size has been changed to @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig : learningmimo ] shows the result , again a reasonable performance with such a fixed non - optimum step size .",
    "moreover , we have used the matlab function ` tic ' and ` toc ' to calculate the running time for the two scenarios .",
    "based on a windows 7 computer with intel core i5 - 2467 m cpu ( 1.60ghz ) and 4 gb memory , it took about 4.9 seconds for each run of the first scenario and 10.6 seconds for each run of the second scenario .",
    "this time is dependent on the stepsize adopted for the algorithm .",
    "a larger stepsize will significantly reduce the time required for convergence .",
    "the reason for our current step size value ( which is quite small ) is to make sure the algorithm will converge for all channel realizations in the simulation . in practice , this step size could be normalized according to the received signal powers to give a much faster convergence rate , in a similar way to the normalized lms algorithm in literature for complex - valued signals  @xcite .",
    "now we consider an example for the qcma .",
    "a well - known problem with constant modulus based algorithm is that it may converge to local minima depending on its initial values .",
    "we find that it is very difficult to initialize the algorithm properly to perform both the equalization and beamforming tasks simultaneously based on the general mimo structure .",
    "so here we only show a case for blind equalization using the qcma .",
    "the setting is the same as the first set of simulations . since we are using the 16-@xmath14 modulation scheme ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath101 .",
    "the stepsize is @xmath102 .",
    "the learn curve in terms of the instantaneous cost function @xmath103|^2 - 4)^2 $ ] averaged over 200 runs is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : learninggcma ] , where we can observe that the approximately constant modulus status has been reached .",
    "the scatter plots of constellation before and after equalization for the specific channel realization in ( [ eqn : sim_fc ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qblind_equal ] , which clearly demonstrate that the equalization operation has been successful .",
    "one note is the phase shift in the plot , which is normal as the blind equalization algorithm we employed here is ambiguous to an arbitrary phase shift .",
    "a 4-d modulation scheme using quaternion - valued representation based on two antennas with different polarisation directions has been studied for wireless communications .",
    "although quaternion - valued wireless communication systems have been investigated in the past and research progress has been made in this promising area , a crucial missing link is lack of effective and efficient quaternion - valued signal processing algorithms for channel equalization and interference suppression / beamforming . to fill this gap , two representative quaternion - valued signal processing algorithms have been introduced : one is the reference - signal based quaternion - valued least mean square algorithm with the associated wiener solution , and other one is the blind quaternion - valued constant modulus algorithm .",
    "three sets of simulation results were provided showing that both algorithms work effectively in the single - input - single - output and multiple - input - multiple - output cases and such a 4-d modulation scheme can therefore be considered as a viable approach for future wireless communication systems .",
