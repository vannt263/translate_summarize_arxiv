    "m dwarfs dominate the galactic stellar population both in number and mass . as long - lived sources , they are important tracers of galactic star formation history and chemical evolution , as well as the initial mass function .",
    "most m dwarfs identified in the vicinity of the sun are population i `` field '' stars , with kinematics consistent with galactic disk orbits and near - solar metallicities . however , a small fraction ( @xmath5 0.3% ; digby et al .",
    "2003 ) are metal - poor .",
    "these so - called subdwarfs ( sd ) typically exhibit halo kinematics ( @xmath6 km s@xmath1 ; gizis 1997 ) and were likely formed early in the galaxy s history . until recently ,",
    "the latest - type subdwarfs known were m stars , identified primarily as high proper - motion sources in multi - epoch photographic plate surveys ( e.g. , luyten 1979 ) .",
    "in contrast , hundreds of field dwarfs cooler than type m  the l dwarfs @xcite  have been identified in wide - field , near - infrared ( nir ) surveys such as 2mass @xcite , denis @xcite , and sdss @xcite .",
    "the majority of these low mass stars and brown dwarfs are too faint at optical wavelengths to have been detected on earlier photographic plates .",
    "the first l - type subdwarf was recently identified in the 2mass database ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b03 ) .",
    "this object , 2mass 0532 + 8246 , exhibits many spectral features similar to late - type l field dwarfs , including a steep red optical slope , strong alkali lines and metal hydride bands , deep h@xmath2o absorption in the nir , and pressure - broadened and at optical wavelengths .",
    "the metal hydride bands in the spectrum of 2mass 0532 + 8246 are far stronger than those observed in any field l dwarf , however .",
    "this source also has blue nir colors , @xmath7 , in contrast to @xmath8 typical of field l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the spectral and photometric properties of 2mass 0532 + 8246 , in addition to its high space motion , indicate that it is a l - type halo subdwarf . a second ,",
    "apparently earlier - type , l subdwarf has also been identified by @xcite as part of a proper motion survey using red optical photographic plates @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have extended our census of metal - poor halo objects into the substellar regime ( b03 ) .    in this letter ,",
    "i present the discovery of a second l subdwarf identified in the 2mass point source catalog , 2mass j16262034 + 3925190 ( hereafter 2mass 1626 + 3925 ) .",
    "the identification and subsequent imaging observations of this object are described in @xmath9 2 , and its nir spectrum is presented and analyzed in @xmath9 3 . the importance of this and future l subdwarf discoveries is addressed in @xmath9 4 .",
    "2mass 1626 + 3925 was initially selected from the 2mass database in a search for t dwarfs , brown dwarfs cooler than spectral class l @xcite . like most t dwarfs , this object has blue nir colors ( @xmath10 ; table 1 ) and no optical counterpart in the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "however , inspection of red ( @xmath11 ) and infrared ( @xmath12 ) photographic plates from the second palomar sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter poss - ii ) reveal an offset , moving optical counterpart ( figure 1 ) with @xmath11 = 19.84 and @xmath12 = 16.68 ( * ? ? ? * usno - b1.0 ) .",
    "this counterpart was confirmed by @xmath13-band ircam @xcite and @xmath11-band ccd imaging observations , both conducted at the palomar 60  meyer telescope on 14 april and 1 july 2000 ( ut ) , respectively .",
    "the offset between the poss - ii @xmath11 plate ( epoch 1993.3 ) and the 2mass detection ( epoch 1998.3 ) implies a high proper motion , measured plate was measured by creating a 2mass - based astrometric reference frame from 25 nearby field stars ; see @xcite .",
    "a statistically consistent value of @xmath14 yr@xmath1 at @xmath15 was measured between the 2mass detection and the epoch 1995.5 poss - ii @xmath12 plate . ] to be @xmath16 = 1@xmath1727@xmath180@xmath1703 yr@xmath1 at position angle @xmath19 . despite being an interesting , late - type source ,",
    "2mass 1626 + 3925 was initially rejected as being too optically bright for a t dwarf .",
    "however , following the identification of 2mass 0532 + 8246 in the same search sample , this source was re - examined to determine if it too is a late - type subdwarf .",
    "nir spectroscopic observations of 2mass 1626 + 3925 were obtained during 23 - 24 july 2004 ( ut ) using the spex instrument @xcite mounted on the nasa 3.0 m infrared telescope facility .",
    "observing conditions were excellent , with clear skies and 0@xmath1750@xmath177 seeing .",
    "spectral data were obtained in both prism and cross - dispersed modes , with complete 0.72.5 @xmath20 coverage at spectral resolutions @xmath21 @xmath22 150 and 1200 , respectively , for the employed 0@xmath175 slit .",
    "additional observations of the a0 v stars hd 153345 and hd 158261 were obtained for flux and telluric absorption calibration .",
    "all spectral data were reduced using the spextool package @xcite .",
    "further details on the experimental design and data reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the reduced , low resolution nir spectrum of 2mass 1626 + 3925 , along with those of three late - type m subdwarfs  lhs 377 @xcite , lsr 2036 + 5059 @xcite , and ssspm 1013@xmath233956 @xcite3956 was also identified in the same 2mass t dwarf search sample from which 2mass 0532 + 8246 and 2mass 1626 + 3925 were drawn.]all obtained with the spex spectrograph ( burgasser et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "these subdwarfs are optically classified sdm7 , sdm7.5 , and sdm9.5 , respectively , according to the scheme of @xcite .",
    "all four nir spectra exhibit signatures typical of late - type dwarfs , with steep red optical spectral slopes , tio absorption at 0.84 @xmath20 , strong alkali lines of and ( particularly between 1.1 and 1.3 @xmath20 ) , and stellar h@xmath2o absorption at 1.4 and 1.8 @xmath20 .",
    "they also exhibit features characteristic of metal - poor stars , including enhanced metal hydride bands ( feh , crh ) ; weak metal oxide bands ( note the weak or absent co band at 2.3 @xmath20 ) ; and blue nir spectral energy distributions .",
    "the blue nir colors are due to collision - induced , h@xmath2 1 - 0 quadrupole absorption centered near 2.5 @xmath20 , which is enhanced in the higher - pressure photospheres of metal - poor cool subdwarfs @xcite .    in 2mass 1626 + 3956 ,",
    "these low - temperature , metal - poor spectral features become even more pronounced .",
    "crh and feh bands at 0.86 and 0.87 @xmath20 are seen distinctly in the moderate resolution cross - dispersed data , while the 0.99 @xmath20 feh wing - ford band is deeper than those of any field m or l dwarf observed to date @xcite .",
    "feh absorption is also strong in the 1.2 - 1.3 @xmath20 region .",
    "we detect a weak signature of the @xmath24-x@xmath25 band of tih at 0.94 @xmath20 ( * ? ? ?",

    "this band is not responsible for an as yet unidentified feature centered at 0.96 @xmath20 , however , present in the spectra of both 2mass 1626 + 3925 and 2mass 0532 + 8246 . beyond 1.3 @xmath20",
    "the nir spectrum of 2mass 1626 + 3925 is generally featureless , with the exception of strong h@xmath2o absorption at 1.4 and possibly 1.8 @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the 2.3 @xmath20 co band is completely absent , and @xmath26-band flux is highly suppressed by h@xmath2 absorption .",
    "figure 3 displays the moderate resolution 1.15 - 1.35 @xmath20 spectrum of 2mass 1626 + 3925 , along with those of 2mass 0532 + 8246 and the l2 field dwarf kelu 1 @xcite , both measured with the keck nirspec instrument ( * ? ? ?",
    "significant feh absorption is present in the spectra of all three objects , with strong bands at 1.20 , 1.22 , and 1.24 @xmath20 , and fine features throughout the displayed spectral region @xcite .",
    "lines may also be present in the spectrum of 2mass 1626 + 3925 , albeit quite weak .",
    "the doublet lines at 1.17/1.18 and 1.24/1.25 @xmath20 are notably broadened in the subdwarf spectra .",
    "a measurement of the full width at half maximum of the shorter wavelength pair yields 16.3 and 19.4  at 1.17 and 1.18 @xmath20 , respectively , 20% broader than measured for the rapidly rotating kelu 1 ( @xmath27 km s@xmath1 ; basri et al .",
    "2000)1159ab ( b03 ) .",
    "the 1.24/1.25 @xmath20 lines are partly blended with feh absorption . ] .",
    "this is indicative of pressure broadening , consistent with the high photospheric pressures implied from enhanced h@xmath2 absorption at @xmath26-band .",
    "the spectra in figure 2 show a natural progression of deepening feh and h@xmath2o bands , strengthening h@xmath2 absorption , and increasingly red optical slopes .",
    "2mass 1626 + 3925 is clearly the latest - type source of the four , apparently cooler than the sdm9.5 ssspm 1013@xmath231356 .",
    "furthermore , the depth of the 1.4 @xmath20 h@xmath2o band is similar to those of early- and mid - type l dwarfs observed with the same instrumental setup @xcite , although it is somewhat weaker than that of 2mass 0532 + 8246 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that 2mass 1626 + 3925 is a _ bona - fide _",
    "l subdwarf , but of earlier type than 2mass 0532 + 8246 .    furthermore , the kinematics of 2mass 1626 + 3925 appear to be consistent with membership in the galactic halo .",
    "the radial velocity of this source was measured by cross correlating its moderate resolution @xmath13-band spectrum with nirspec spectra of 8 l dwarfs with known radial velocities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see b03 ) .",
    "the resulting heliocentric value , @xmath28 km s@xmath1 , is much too high for a nearby disk star . likewise , assuming that 2mass 1626 + 3925 has an absolute @xmath13-band magnitude similar to that of an early- to mid - type l dwarf , @xmath29 @xcite , its estimated spectrophotometric distance of 15 - 35 pc implies @xmath4 90 - 210 km s@xmath1 , characteristic of thick disk or halo stars . a more accurate determination of this object s kinematics will require a parallax measurement .",
    "finally , if 2mass 1626 + 3925 has the same effective temperature as an early- or mid - type l dwarf , 1800 @xmath30 t@xmath31 @xmath30 2300 k @xcite , then it straddles the hydrogen burning minimum mass for @xmath32 and is substellar for lower metallicities ( c.f .",
    ", figure 3 of b03 ) .",
    "again , parallax and bolometric luminosity measurements are needed to verify this possibility .",
    "the identification of l subdwarfs such as 2mass 1626 + 3925 enables a new approach to studying the atmospheric physics of cool stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the chemistry and bandstrengths of molecular species in the atmospheres of late - m and l dwarfs are highly sensitive to the total metal abundance .",
    "metal - poor environments can therefore produce emergent spectra with very different dominant species ( i.e. , metal hydrides ) or enable the detection of species that are otherwise suppressed ( i.e. , tih ) .",
    "it remains unclear as to what extent condensate clouds can form in cool metal - poor atmospheres ( b03 ) , the suppression of which would have a significant impact on nir spectral energy distributions and the retention of atmospheric chemical species such as atomic alkalis @xcite .",
    "the higher photospheric pressures of cool subdwarfs also make them excellent laboratories for studying the pressure - broadened wings of the and fundamental transitions at optical wavelengths @xcite as well as pressure - sensitive h@xmath2 absorption in the nir .",
    "the latter is a key absorber in the spectra of cool white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the unique spectra of l subdwarfs imply that existing classification schemes are inappropriate to characterize these objects .",
    "a revised scheme , preferably based on red optical and/or @xmath13-band spectral features , should be matched closely to established l field dwarf schemes ( e.g. , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 ) to enable the straightforward assessment of metallicity effects .",
    "however , the definition of a rigorous classification scheme , as well as more general studies of the l subdwarf population as a whole , require a systematic search for these objects .",
    "this may best be accomplished by a wide - field nir proper motion survey , in analogy to the successful photographic plate surveys of the past .",
