    "type - ii superconductors have been the focus of many theoretical and experimental investigations since their discovery . from the fundamental physics perspective",
    ", these materials represent a class of systems with many competing energy scales and thus a remarkably rich variety of thermodynamic phases , as well as intriguingly complex transport properties  @xcite . applied science and engineering research on type - ii superconductors",
    "has focused primarily on their optimization for technological applications , especially in magnetic fields .",
    "the most prominent desirable property of superconductors is of course the absence of current flow dissipation in these materials .",
    "however in the mixed phase of type - ii superconductors , magnetic flux enters the sample in the form of quantized vortex lines , and external driving currents generate a lorentz force that in turn causes these vortices to move , creating ohmic dissipation in the system . to prevent flux flow and",
    "thus restore dissipation - free transport , effective pinning mechanisms of flux lines to material defects are required  @xcite .",
    "different types of defects are utilized as pinning centers for magnetic vortices , predominantly uncorrelated point - like disorder and extended linear ( columnar ) defects .",
    "point defects are naturally occurring , e.g. , in ceramic high-@xmath0 materials in the form of oxygen vacancies , but can also be artificially introduced , for instance by electron irradiation  @xcite .",
    "the presence of weak point pinning centers destroys the long - range crystalline order of the low - temperature abrikosov flux line lattice in the disorder - free system , to form either a genuine disordered vortex glass phase  @xcite or a bragg glass state that is characterized by quasi long - range positional order  @xcite .",
    "the thermally induced first - order melting transition of the vortex lattice at elevated temperatures  @xcite is thereby replaced by a disorder - driven continuous phase transition between frustrated ( ` glassy ' ) low - temperature states and a fluctuating flux liquid phase .",
    "columnar defects too may be naturally present in the sample as line dislocations , and can in addition be artificially introduced by growing them using , for instance , mgo nanorods  @xcite or through irradiating the sample with high - energy ions such as sn , pb , or iodine .",
    "in contrast with point - like disorder , the presence of correlated columnar defects results in the emergence of a novel low - temperature thermodynamic state distinct from the vortex glass phase , namely the strongly pinned bose glass  @xcite . since vortex lines become then localized along the entire length of these linear pinning centers , the sample s tilt modulus diverges ( transverse meissner effect ) @xcite . indeed , columnar defects have experimentally proven more efficient at pinning than uncorrelated point - like disorder due to their extended nature  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in the vortex glass phase in the presence of point - like disorder , the low - energy flux line contours tend to roughen as the vortices minimize their free energy in the disordered pinning landscape , while in the bose glass phase in the presence of columnar defects that are oriented along the magnetic field direction the bound vortex lines are effectively straight .",
    "therefore , these two disorder - dominated glassy phases in fact display very different lateral and transverse vortex line fluctuations .",
    "one consequently expects samples with point disorder and columnar defects to yield profoundly distinct non - equilibrium relaxation properties .",
    "some materials undergo slow relaxation processes to eventually reach thermal equilibrium , which affects their measured dynamical properties and renders these effectively time - dependent ; this is referred to as physical ` aging '  @xcite .",
    "many glassy systems have been observed to undergo physical aging  @xcite owing to the very slow kinetics between a large number of energetically close metastable states typically emerging in frustrated environments . in a superconducting 2h - nbse@xmath1 sample , du _",

    "pleimling and tuber then employed an elastic line model and monte carlo simulations to investigate the non - equilibrium relaxation properties of magnetic vortices in type - ii superconductors starting from somewhat artificial initial configurations where straight flux lines were placed at random positions in the sample  @xcite .",
    "the resulting complex aging features ( with identical initial conditions and parameter values ) were subsequently confirmed in a very different microscopic representation of the non - equilibrium vortex kinetics through langevin molecular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the rich non - equilibrium relaxation dynamics and aging features of complex systems such as disordered vortex matter with various competing energy and time scales is of fundamental interest . specifically , it is crucial to assess the relevance of distinct initial configurations and their effects on the subsequent slow relaxation kinetics .    in this present work ,",
    "we investigate in detail the aging relaxation dynamics of vortex matter in disordered type - ii superconductors starting from initial conditions that more closely resemble experimentally realizable situations , where we analyze the effects of sudden changes in either the system s ambient temperature or magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to both make closer contact to experiment , and to explicitly test the sensitivity of the non - equilibrium aging kinetics to the selection of initial states . as in our earlier studies",
    ", we can switch off the repulsive vortex interactions , the pinning potentials , or both in our computer simulations , and thereby identify the physical mechanisms for the observed complex features in the vortex relaxation dynamics .",
    "again , crucial differences in the fluctuation spectrum for vortex matter in the presence of point - like or extended defects become apparent .",
    "in addition , separately tracking the behavior of the originally present , already relaxed flux lines and the newly added vortices helps our analysis of the simulations with sudden magnetic field increases .",
    "one of the principal goals of this investigation is to identify observable correlations that allow a dynamical characterization of material samples .",
    "experimental methods that could be used to extract the relevant quantities include the following techniques : vortices in type - ii superconductors were imaged by vasyukov _",
    "_ using nano - squids in scanning probe microscopy  @xcite , with recorded magnetic fields down to @xmath3nt",
    ". furthermore , auslaender _ et al . _ used the tip of a magnetic force microscope to drag the end of a single vortex across the surface of a ybco sample , directly measuring its interaction with a local disorder potential , in order to study the dynamics of vortices and their ( de-)pinning processes from different defects  @xcite . flux creep parameters in ybco samples were experimentally investigated by abulafia _",

    "these methods could perhaps be utilized to probe the relaxation processes of magnetic vortex lines in a disordered medium following quenches in temperature or magnetic field , and to distinguish the effects of different types of disorder on the dynamics of this complex system .",
    "the initial configuration of randomly placed straight vortices that were implemented in earlier numerical studies can not be realized in experiments .",
    "instead , we investigate the effects of abrupt changes of external experimental control parameters , namely the system s ambient temperature and magnetic field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the elastic line model and the langevin molecular dynamics simulation algorithm that we employ in our study , and also specify the material parameters that we use in our computational model .",
    "then , we specify the single - time quantities and two - time correlation functions that are measured in our simulations to analyze the non - equilibrium and aging properties of our vortex matter models .",

    "we compare the effects of sudden increases or decreases of the vortex density to our earlier studies where the magnetic field remained fixed .",
    "we systematically disentangle the contributions due to repulsive vortex interactions and pinning to disorder .",
    "we find the non - equilibrium relaxation features of vortex matter to strongly depend on the type of disorder present in the system .",
    "we finally summarize our work in the concluding section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we therefore introduce the times @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "we rather consider our simulation domain as a representative sample of the bulk region in a much larger physical system .",
    "also , the formation or deletion of vortices from the sample s boundaries occurs on time scales much faster than considered in this study of comparatively slow relaxation kinetics .",
    "temperature quenches are accomplished by letting the initial configuration of @xmath62 flux lines relax up to a similar initial relaxation time ( @xmath63 ) at which the temperature is suddenly raised or lowered . throughout our analysis of magnetic field and temperature quenches ,",

    "@xmath73 thus measures the thermal fluctuations of line elements around their corresponding mean lateral line position .",

    "another one - time observable that we measure in our simulations is the fraction @xmath76 of pinned line elements when disorder is present . to this end",
    ", we first find the number of line elements that reside within a fixed small cut - off distance from a certain pinning center at a given time @xmath59 .",

    "+ [ -1.3ex ] + [ -1.4ex ]    in our work , we restrict ourselves to a low magnetic field or vortex density regime , and only consider systems composed of between @xmath78 and @xmath79 vortices .",
    "this naturally constitutes a tiny system compared to typical experimental samples of disordered type - ii superconductors in external magnetic fields .",
    "it is therefore crucial to analyze the effects of this small vortex density , especially when we remove lines as the magnetic field sudden decreases .",
    "we consequently ran simulations in systems with different numbers of flux lines , but keeping the density of pinning centers the same in all cases .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .",

    "therefore , we conclude that these differently - sized systems follow similar relaxation processes confirming that finite - size effects do not play a prominent role in this computational study of dilute systems of flux lines in a dissipative medium .",
    "it is worth noting that the physics in denser vortex systems could of course be quite different .",
    "we first consider sudden changes in the ambient temperature of the system of interacting vortex lines , with the goal to analyze the effects of instantaneous increases in temperature on the system s relaxation dynamics . at @xmath63 in our simulation",
    ", we instantaneously increase the temperature from @xmath82 to @xmath83 in a system of @xmath62 interacting flux lines in the presence of either point or columnar pinning centers .",
    "we then compare the relaxation of the radius of gyration @xmath84 and the fraction of pinned line elements @xmath76 when the temperature stays fixed with the scenario wherein it is suddenly raised .",
    "we remark that the error bars displayed in some of the figures in this section , however small they appear , always represent the standard error of the mean of the computed quantities .",
    "we observe that the relaxation of these observables in the considered systems can invariably be mapped to an exponential function of the form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 determines a characteristic relaxation time .",
    "the measured values for the relaxation times @xmath86 in different scenarios are summarized in table  [ table : rel - time ] .",
    "we note that the exponential relaxation of observables in our vortex model system following sudden temperatures quenches implies that physical aging features would not be discernible on time scales larger than the relaxation time @xmath86 .    in systems with point - like disorder , the measured relaxation time of the radius of gyration at high temperature is shorter than that at low temperature , see table  [ table : rel - time ] .",
    "this confirms that thermal fluctuations facilitate the roughening of vortices in the presence of point - like disorder . following a sudden increase in temperature ,",
    "the radius of gyration first decreases a little as a few flux line segments become thermally depinned , and subsequently increases monotonically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp - up - int - point - rg ] .",
    "we checked that this increase in @xmath80 is well described by an exponential function of the form @xmath85 , with relaxation time @xmath87 ( the other parameters are @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) as observed in the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : temp - up - int - point - rg ] .",
    "thus , as expected , point defects enhance thermal wandering of flux lines in this disordered landscape .",
    "+    in contrast , systems with columnar defects actually require a longer relaxation time for the radius of gyration at higher temperatures than that at lower temperatures , see table  [ table : rel - time ] , asserting that thermal fluctuations resist the straightening of vortex lines as they become localized at columnar pinning centers .",
    "when we instantaneously increase the temperature in this system , the gyration radius after the quench shows a marked fast increase , even beyond the relaxation curve for a system at constant higher temperature , followed by a much slower decrease , see fig .",
    "[ fig : temp - up - int - col - rg ] . the initial increase in @xmath90",
    "can likely be attributed to the creation of double - kinks in the system that are not similarly generated in relaxation processes at fixed temperature , while the final decrease is due to the decay of these metastable configurations",
    ". a double - kink refers to a flux line configuration where the vortex is simultaneously pinned to two adjacent columnar defects .",
    "this is a long - lived state which will eventually decay to either a free vortex , or , more probably , to a straight flux line bound to a single defect column .",
    "we find that both the initial increase and the final decrease in the gyration radius again fit an exponential of the form @xmath85 , but with different relaxation times ( and signs of the coefficient @xmath91 ) : in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp - up - int - col - rg ] , the fast relaxation time from the initial non - equilibrium steady state at @xmath82 to the metastable state with vortex double - kinks is @xmath92 , while the much longer relaxation time from this intermediate state to the final non - equilibrium steady state at @xmath83 is @xmath93 .",

    "+    the differences between the systems responses to temperature up - quenches in the presence of point and columnar pinning centers , respectively , can be attributed to the very distinct ( de-)pinning behavior that we shall again discuss later in the context of sudden magnetic field changes . when the temperature is suddenly raised in systems with uncorrelated point disorder ,",
    "some line elements become thermally depinned .",
    "the vortices are initially straightened owing to their line tension .",

    "yet they soon become pinned to neighboring defect lines causing the subsequent decrease in the lateral spatial vortex line fluctuations , akin to systems relaxing at fixed temperature .",

    "[ fig : temp - up - int - point - col - pp ] . as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp - up - int - point - pp ] , in the presence of point disorder only a minority ( @xmath94 ) of line elements are actually pinned right before the temperature quench .",
    "a sudden increase in temperature releases a significant fraction of these pinned line elements causing a decrease in @xmath95 as well as the small dip in @xmath90 .",
    "later , the vortices become attached to and hence stretched between point - like pins causing a subsequent increase in @xmath95 , accompanied with a monotonic increase in the lines spatial fluctuations .        in the presence of columnar defects , on the other hand , fig .  [",
    "fig : temp - up - int - col - pp ] shows that almost all line elements are bound to pinning centers just before the temperature quench is applied .",
    "the sudden temperature increase causes a tiny number of these line elements to depin from their localizing columns . however , they are soon to be pinned again , but partly in metastable double - kink configurations .",
    "this explains the non - monotonic pattern we observe in the spatial fluctuations with a rapid increase of @xmath90 followed by a slow decrease .",
    "finally , the fraction of pinned line elements @xmath76 following the temperature quench in the presence of both types of disorder once again fits an exponential of the form @xmath85 , yet with different relaxation times : @xmath96 for point disorder , whereas @xmath97 for columnar defects , see table  [ table : rel - time ] .",
    "this confirms that enhanced thermal fluctuations at elevated temperatures resist the straightening of flux lines as they attempt to bind to columnar defects ; in stark contrast , thermal effects facilitate line roughening when vortices become pinned to uncorrelated point - like disorder .",
    "we also analyzed the effects of a sudden drop in temperature , where we reduced the system s ambient temperature at @xmath63 from @xmath83 to @xmath82 in our simulation runs .",
    "the subsequent vortex relaxation kinetics displays some noticeable differences as compared with the previous up - quenches : following the temperature decrease , the gyration radius decreases and the fraction of pinned line elements increases in samples with both types of disorder , and non - monotonic behavior is observed in neither of these quantities , as depicted for @xmath90 in fig .",

    "instead , dynamical scaling ensues for @xmath102 with the aging exponent @xmath105 , _ c.f .",
    "6(d ) in ref .",
    "in contrast , dynamical scaling is not observed for the height - height autocorrelation function @xmath103 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noquench - noint - point - c ] , the data for all waiting times @xmath56 display identical time evolution , since the system has in fact fully equilibrated owing to the long relaxation period @xmath55 , and time translation invariance is restored .",
    "the height autocorrelation function shows a similar increase for all waiting times indicating that flux line elements keep exploring their surroundings in search of favorable pinning sites , which causes the lines to continuously roughen due to the uncorrelated nature of the point - like disorder in the system .",
    "+    the results for a sudden magnetic field decrease ( vortex density down - quench ) turn out to not significantly differ from the situation with constant field .",
    "this is readily attributed to the fact that the lines are not interacting , and thus the remaining vortices after the quench are not at all affected by the removal of some lines from the sample .",
    "more distinct features are observed upon an instantaneous increase of the magnetic field : first of all , the mean - square displacement @xmath102 of the initial lines does not display dynamical scaling anymore , but the data ( not shown ) reveal that this vortex subpopulation has rather recovered time translation invariance , since they all collapse onto a single curve when plotted against @xmath106 , while the added line subpopulation displays neither of these straightforward features . the height - height autocorrelation function @xmath103 of the initial lines shows time translation invariance , akin to the data in fig .",

    "[ fig : upquench - noint - point - cad ] , displays an initial decrease followed by an increase , with the minimum shifted to later @xmath107 values for longer waiting times @xmath56 .",
    "the decrease happens when the added lines start noticing the presence of the pinning centers and become pinned to nearby defects , which decreases their transverse fluctuations .",
    "the subsequent increase is caused by the flux lines exploring more of the sample and thus becoming rougher as they optimize their pinning configurations .",
    "hence , the behavior of the added lines is highly influenced by disorder as demonstrated by their height autocorrelations .",
    "a one - time observable that also highlights the effects of the sudden increase in the magnetic field is the fraction of pinned vortex line elements @xmath95 . in the presence of point disorder ,",
    "this fraction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upquench - noint - point - pp ] displays a two - step increase , which can be attributed to the pinning dynamics of the newly added magnetic flux lines , as discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : upquench - noint - point - cad ] .",
    "we proceed to change the type of pinning centers present in the system to columnar defects , which are linearly extended pinning sites that are simulated as potential wells aligned along the @xmath9 direction , and compare their effects on the relaxation kinetics of non - interacting vortices to that of uncorrelated point disorder .",
    "+    we again first hold the magnetic field constant and consider the different two - time correlation functions studied above .",

    "[ fig : noquench - noint - nodis - b ] in the absence of disorder .",
    "it is worth recalling that when flux lines are completely pinned to columnar defects , their mean - square displacement becomes constant , of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dynamics of @xmath102 in the accessible time window is clearly dominated by the still unattached lines in the system .",
    "the height - height autocorrelation function @xmath103 does not display dynamical scaling with any fixed scaling exponent .",
    "however , when considering the normalized @xmath103 with respect to the initial value @xmath108 as depicted in fig .  [ fig : noint - col - noquench - c ] , we observe that the data for all different waiting times @xmath56 perfectly collapse onto a single curve , which indicates that time translation invariance is restored and the system is well equilibrated .",
    "next , we measure the fraction of pinned line elements in the system with columnar defects , see fig .",
    "[ fig : noint - col - noquench - pp ] .",
    "the data for different waiting times collapse onto a single graph , where the fraction of pinned line elements stays constant for an extended time period and only later , at @xmath109 , starts increasing .",
    "this indicates that @xmath110 represents a characteristic time scale when pinning to columnar defects becomes prominent in the system .    when vortices are removed from this system of non - interacting flux lines with columnar defects , the measured mean - square displacement , height autocorrelations , and fraction of pinned line elements all yield identical results to the situation when there is no sudden magnetic field change , as is to be expected in the absence of correlations .",
    "upon introducing additional flux lines into the system , the mean - square displacement of both the initial and the added lines subpopulations shows dynamical scaling for all waiting times with the same exponent @xmath101 as in the fixed density and field down - quench scenarios .",

    "the autocorrelation function @xmath103 for the initially present lines turns out very similar to that at fixed density , see fig .  [",

    "this indicates that this subpopulation of lines is not yet equilibrated for the range of waiting times @xmath56 employed here .",
    "as the additional lines are inserted into the sample , depending on the elapsed waiting time @xmath56 , they require different time periods @xmath59 to explore the system and become attached to columnar pins .",
    "this is corroborated in the time evolution of the fraction of pinned line elements @xmath95 for different waiting times in fig .",
    "[ fig : noint - col - upquench - pp ] , which also does not yield data collapse .",
    "the flux lines present in the sample , especially vortices that were suddenly added to the system , start exploring the surrounding pinning centers sooner for shorter waiting times , whence one observes an earlier increase in the fraction of pinned line elements for smaller @xmath56 . for the long waiting times in fig .",
    "[ fig : noint - col - upquench - pp ] such as @xmath112 , the fraction of pinned line elements is fixed at a plateau value for an extended duration because the vortices already had enough time to relax towards favorable configurations after the field up - quench .",

    "the overall trend in the presence of columnar defects is that the dynamics is dominated by the few lines that remain unattached to any pins , and the tendency of each flux line to become fully localized to a single columnar pinning center , which in turn straightens the vortex lines .",
    "the preceding discussions highlight the influence of different disorder on non - interacting vortex matter and the relaxation dynamics following magnetic field quenches .",
    "we expect that quite distinct relaxation kinetics will be observed when mutual vortex interactions are added to our consideration and collective behavior ensues , as will be explored in the following subsections .",

    "furthermore , a local maximum in @xmath103 is observed for all waiting times @xmath56 , which we attribute to the decay of metastable kink configurations .",
    "such single kinks are step - like flux line structures that are stabilized by the screened logarithmic repulsive forces ; hence they constitute interaction - induced features that are long - lived .",
    "the mean - square displacement @xmath102 loses the dynamical aging scaling property when lines are removed from the system , whereas @xmath103 displays similar behavior to that at fixed magnetic field , but with the local maxima absent for most waiting times .",
    "this indicates a destabilization of single - kink structures due to the decrease in the number of lines in the sample , which relieves the effective mutual cages generated by the repulsive interactions .",

    "this dynamical scaling is manifest only when the initial relaxation time @xmath58 is disregarded in our scaling formula for both the initial lines and the collection of all lines .",
    "the independence of these subpopulations from the initial relaxation time implies that the respective lines do not retain memory of their early dynamics and only experience changes upon the addition of new vortices , reflecting the mutual interactions and consequent dynamical correlations .",

[ fig : int - nodis - upquench - cad ] displays a plateau followed by an increase , which is in turn followed by a final decrease for all waiting times .",
