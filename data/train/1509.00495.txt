    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are the evolved descendents of massive stars , with two main flavours : helium - rich wn stars displaying the products of core h burning and carbon - rich wc stars displaying the products of core he burning .",
    "an overview of the number of wr stars in the milky way is provided .",
    "the galactic census tripled between the 1st @xcite and the 6th catalogues ( van der hucht 1981 ) , a century later ( table  [ catalogues ] ) , and subsequently doubled by the annex to the 7th catalogue owing to deep narrow - band optical surveys @xcite , the discovery of rich star clusters @xcite and infrared surveys of the galactic centre region @xcite . over the past decade , the number has doubled again , primarily through surveys arising from the advent of large format infrared detectors , with the census totalling 642 , comprising 357 wn stars , 8 wn / c stars , 273 wc stars and 4 wo stars .",
    "[ catalogues ]    [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we assume that the observed wr distribution is complete to k=8 mag ( though see below ) , @xmath3550 wr dominated stars in the galactic disk reproduce the observed wr distribution .",
    "in addition , over 100 wr stars are currently known with @xmath4 so the total cmz population may be as large as 250 .",
    "such a large population is surprisin given that the cmz accounts for perhaps 5% of the entire milky way star formation rate @xcite , but the presence of three very massive clusters in the galactic centre region suggests wr stars may be disproportionately represented .",
    "a total of 550 + 250 = 800 stars would represent only 82% of the non - dusty wr population since 18% of systems are expected to be dominated by the wr companion in the k - band , so the non - dusty wr population inferred is @xmath3950 . finally , including dusty wc stars , which comprise 15% ( 150 ) of the whole population",
    ", we estimate n(wr ) = 1,100 , providing n(wcd)/n(wc ) is uniform across all galactocentric radii .",
    "a histogram of the predicted jhk@xmath5 magnitudes for this predicted wr population is presented in fig .",
    "[ histogram ] .     and gaia g - band magnitudes predicted from the model wr population by @xcite.thick lines represent populations consisting of wn and non - dusty wc stars , while the dotted - line illustrates a model population in which 28% of wc stars are dust - forming with @xmath6 mag . ]    based on this global wr population of 1,100 ,",
    "if the lower mass threshold to wr stars is @xmath7 , an average lifetime for the wr phase of 0.25 myr is implied by the current milky way star formation rate of 1.9 @xmath2 yr@xmath8 @xcite and a standard kroupa initial mass function .",
    "this characteristic lifetime is in fair agrement with non - rotation evolutionary models , but is somewhat shorter than rotating model predictions .",
    "if the observed wr distribution is not complete to k=8 mag , the acual wr population will increase . by way of example , the two most recent additions to the on - line catalogue ( v1.13 ) involve wr111 - 13 , a wn6 star from @xcite with k=8.02 mag and wr111 - 14 , a wn78 star from @xcite with k=7.7 mag . if the wr - dominated disk population were 650 instead of 550 , a global population of 1,300 would be inferred , so the current census may be 50% complete .",
    "a brief overview of the wolf - rayet population in the milky way is presented .",
    "the current census of 642 ( v1.13 of online catalogue ) represents a doubling of the population since the annex to the 7th wr catalogue only a decade ago , due to systematic searches from narrow - band surveys at 2@xmath9 m and broad - band near to mid - ir surveys .",
    "a strict lower limit to the binary fraction is 34% ( sb12 systems plus dusty wc stars ) for v@xmath10 15 mag , but the actual fraction will oudoubedly be significantly higher .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of wr stars in the near - ir is now feasible owing to multi - object ir integral field units ( e.g. kmos at eso s vlt ) .    excluding the galactic centre region , @xmath020% of wr stars",
    "are located in star clusters , adding weight to the formation of most massive stars in ob associations , i.e. away from dense clusters .",
    "the current wr census may be 50% complete , in which case the average duration of the wr phase is 0.25 myr for a lower mass limit of 25 @xmath2 to the formation of wr stars .",
    "the majority of systems hosting wr stars are dominated by the he - rich component in the k - band , so these are fundamentally high luminosity ( high mass ) stars .",
    "in contrast , typical progenitors of stripped envelope core - collapse supernovae are relatively low mass stars , having transferred the majority of their h - rich envelope to a close companion .",
    "such systems would not be recognised as conventional wr stars since the he - rich mass donor would be masked by the h - rich mass gainer at optical and near - ir wavelengths ."
