    "historically the first speculations about the existence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and super massive black holes ( smbhs ) came from the huge energy requirements implied by the discovery of distant powerful radio galaxies and quasars . today",
    ", radio observations remain crucial to understanding the role of smbhs in astrophysics . only at radio wavelengths",
    "is it possible to image the region immediately surrounding the smbh central engine and the relativistic jets which apparently originate with the smbh .",
    "typical resolution obtained with very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations at centimeter wavelengths is of the order of 0.001 arccsecond ( 1 milliarcsec ) .",
    "thus , for nearby sources such as those located in the virgo cluster , a linear resolution of 1 milliarcsec corresponds to only about 0.1 parsec or about 100 schwartzchild radii for the smbh located in the nucleus of m87 .",
    "for @xmath1 the resolution for earth - based vlbi is @xmath2 10 kpc .",
    "however , using an earth to space interferometry at @xmath3 1 cm or earth - based systems at millimeter wavelengths , the resolution is improved by more than another order of magnitude .",
    "finally , we note that at radio wavelengths , there is no obscuration , even close to the smbh .    however , not all radio sources are due to agn ; and not all agn and smbhs are radio sources . nearly all observed extragalactic radio emission is probably due to synchrotron radiation from ultra relativistic electron with energies @xmath3 10 gev moving in weak magnetic fields with @xmath4 to @xmath5 gauss .",
    "the high energy electrons are thought to be accelerated in one of two ways ; either by a central engine associated with accretion onto a smbh in elliptical galaxies or in quasars , or by supernovae following massive star formation ( starbursts ) in the nucleus of early type galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , both processes are often referred to as agn , and this has led to considerable confusion in the literature .",
    "above @xmath6 mjy , the radio source number - flux density relation is dominated by sources driven by smbhs .",
    "these more powerful sources are characterized by extended radio lobes , and by highly beamed relativistic jets extending from a few parsecs to hundreds of kiloparsecs from the smbh . at microjy levels there is an increasing contribution from star formation related activity rather than from a smbh .",
    "however , there is an uncomfortably large spread in the observed microjy source count even among different observers using the same instrument , the vla , in the same field .",
    "most likely these discrepancies are the result of systematic errors in the reported flux densities due to uncertainties in corrections for the effects of resolution @xcite .",
    "a recent complexity comes from the arcade 2 balloon measurement of a 3 ghz sky brightness of @xmath7 k which is about 5 sigma above that expected from known radio sources , suggesting a possible population of previously unrecognized weak sub microjansky sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( fixen et al . 2011 ) ) . however , deep 3 ghz vla observations showed no evidence for any source population greater than about 30 nanojy .",
    "any population of weaker sources that could produce the excess sky brightness would need to have a sky density greater than 6 x @xmath8 per ster , or 60 times greater than the density of the faintest ( mag 29 ) galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( * ? ? ? * ( condon et al .",
    "2012 ) ) . thus if the excess background temperature observed by arcade",
    "is real and due to discrete sources , these sources can not be associated with any known galaxy population .",
    "it will be important to verify that the arcade 2 results were not contaminated by unrecognized galactic radio emission .",
    "radio emission due to agn can usually be distinguished from that due to star formation in a variety of ways .",
    "@xmath9  * morphology : * star formation sources may have dimensions of the order of a few tenths of an arcsecond or a few kiloparsecs at cosmological distances while smbh driven agn sources are typically very small , of the order of 0.001 arcsec ( 10 pc ) or less , and are coincident with the galaxy nucleus or qso .",
    "quasars and agn powered by smbhs are often variable on time scales as short as days with corresponding changes in their morphology indicating highly collimated outflows with apparent superluminal velocity .",
    "smbh driven agn may also contain extended lobes tens or hundreds of kiloparsecs distant from the compact nucleus , and sometimes show optical and radio jets joining the nucleus and radio lobes .",
    "@xmath9  * radio spectra : * star forming sources and the extended radio lobes of agn generally have steep radio spectra . due to synchrotron self absorption ,",
    "the compact sources generally have flat or even inverted spectra .",

    "@xmath9  * radio luminosity : * star forming regions typically have a radio luminosity close to @xmath12 w / hz and follow the well known correlation between radio and fir luminosity @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies and quasars driven by smbhs may be @xmath13 times more luminous so their radio luminosity greatly exceeds that expected from the radio / fir relation characteristic of star forming regions .",
    "@xmath9  * x and @xmath14-ray emission : * star forming regions are only weak x - ray sources with typical luminosity @xmath15 ergs / sec while smbh driven agn can be strong x - ray , @xmath14-ray , and tev sources .",
    "@xmath9  * host galaxies : * smbh driven radio sources are located in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies or are associated with quasars which themselves are thought to be the bright nuclei of elliptical galaxies that greatly outshine their host galaxy .",
    "low ( optical ) luminosity agn are typically found in early type spiral ( often classified as seyfert ) galaxies .",
    "radio emission from star forming regions is typically associated with spiral galaxies but may also be found in the host galaxies of radio quiet quasars ( see section 4 ) .",

    "interestingly , although seyfert s name ultimately became attached to the broad category of spiral galaxies with active nuclei , his 1943 paper received no citations until 1951 , and apparently went unnoticed until baade and minkowski ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1954 ) ) drew attention to the similarity of the cygnus a radio source spectrum with that of the galaxies studied by seyfert .    not until the 1949 nature paper by bolton , stanley , and slee ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1949 ) ) did astronomers finally recognize the vast energy requirements of radio galaxies .",
    "bolton et al .",
    "had identified three of the strongest discrete radio sources with the crab nebula , m87 , and ngc  5128 , until that time the discrete radio sources were widely thought to be associated with galactic stars .",
    "this was understandable , as karl jansky and grote reber had observed radio emission from the milky way . the milky way is composed of stars , so it was natural to assume that the discrete radio sources had a stellar origin .",
    "bolton et al . understood the importance of their identification of the taurus a radio source with the crab nebula which was widely recognized as the remnant of the 1054 supernova reported by chinese observers .",
    "bss correctly identified two other strong sources with m87 and ngc 5128 , but realizing that if they were extragalactic , their absolute radio luminosity would need to be a million times more luminous than that of the crab nebula , they argued that `` ngc 5128 and ngc 4486 ( m87 ) have not been resolved into stars , so there is little direct evidence that they are true galaxies . ''",
    "so they concluded that they are within our own galaxy .",
    "indeed their paper carried the title  positions of three discrete radio sources of galactic radio frequency radiation . \"",
    "john bolton later argued that he really did understand that m87 and ngc 5128 were very luminous radio sources , but that he was concerned that that in view of their apparent extraordinary radio luminosity , nature might not publish their paper .",
    "the following years saw the identification of more radio galaxies , and the changed paradigm which had previously considered all discrete radio sources to be stellar to one with most high latitude sources were assumed to be extragalactic .",
    "the energy requirements were exacerbated in 1951 with the identification of cygnus a , the second strongest radio source in the sky with a magnitude 18 galaxy at what was then considered a high redshift of 0.056 and a corresponding radio luminosity about @xmath16 times more luminous than m87 and ngc  5128 ( * ? ? ? * ( baade and minkowski 1954 ) ) .",
    "the total energy contained in relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the radio lobes of cygnus a and other powerful radio galaxies was estimated to be at least @xmath17 ergs @xcite .",
    "hoyle , fowler , burbidge and burbidge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1964 ) ) were apparently the first to call attention to gravitational collapse as a possible energy source to power radio galaxies . by the middle of 1960 , many radio sources had been identified with galaxies having red shifts up to 0.24 @xcite .",
    "typically the optical counterpart of strong radio sources was identified with an elliptical galaxy that was the brightest member of a cluster . in 1960 , rudolph minkowski ( * ? ? ? * ( 1960 ) ) identified 3c  295 with a mag 20 galaxy at z=0.46 .",
    "3c  295 is about ten times smaller than cygnus a and ten times more distant consistent with the idea that the smallest radio sources might be path finders to finding very distant galaxies .",
    "but a few months later caltech radio astronomers identified the first of several very small sources with what appeared to be galactic stars , thus raising questions about the extragalactic nature of other small diameter radio sources .",
    "while searching for ever more distant radio galaxies , caltech radio astronomers john bolton and tom matthews identified 3c 48 with an apparent stellar object . at the 107th",
    "meting of the american astronomical society held in new york in december 1960 , allan sandage @xcite reported the discovery of  the first true radio star . \" before he left to return to australia , john bolton @xcite speculated that 3c  48 had a high redshift of 0.37 , but was apparently dissuaded by jesse greenstein and ira bowen on the grounds that there was a 3 or 4 angstrom discrepancy among the corresponding rest wavelengths . in a subsequent analysis of the complex emission line spectrum ,",
    "jesse greenstein @xcite interpreted the 3c 48 spectrum in terms of emission lines from highly ionized states of rare earth elements .",
    "he briefly considered a possible redshift of 0.37 , but quickly dismissed the possibility that 3c  48 was extragalactic .",
    "nearly two years would pass , and other compact radio sources would be identified as galactic stars before a series of lunar occultations would lead to the identification of 3c  273 with a star like object at a redshift of 0.16 and the immediate realization that 3c  48 was also extragalactic with a redshift of 0.37 leading to the recognition of quasi stellar radio sources or `` quasars '' as the extremely bright nuclei of galaxies .",
    "the apparent high radio as well as optical luminosity of quasars , coupled with their very small dimensions presented a further challenge to understanding the source of energy and how this energy is converted to relativistic particles and magnetic fields .",
    "the following years led to the identification of more quasars at ever larger redshifts and the suggestion that quasars are powered by accretion onto super massive black holes ( smbh ) with masses up to @xmath18 solar masses or more @xcite . generally , the identified quasars had a significant uv excess compared with stars , so due to the redshift of their spectrum , they appeared blue on photographic plates facilitating their identification with radio sources with even modest position accuracy .    in 1965 , sandage noted that the density of blue stellar objects on the sky was some thousand time greater than that of 3c radio sources .",
    "sandage argued that what he called `` quasi stellar galaxies '' are related to quasars , except that they are not strong radio sources .",
    "but , his paper was widely attacked , perhaps in part because of the perceived irregular treatment by the astrophsyical journal .",
    "sandage s paper was received on may 15 , 1965 at the astrophysical journal , but s. chandrasekar , the apj editor was apparently so impressed by sandage s claim for a  new constituent of universe \" that he held up publication of the journal , and sandage s paper appeared in the may 15 issue",
    ". tom kinman @xcite along with lynds and villere @xcite argued that most of sandage s blue stellar objects were only blue galactic stars , while fritz zwicky @xcite pointed out that he had previously called attention to this phenomena , and he later accused sandage of `` one of the most astounding feats of plagiarism '' @xcite .",
    "as it turned out , most of sandage s blue stellar objects were just that ,  blue stellar objects , \" and",
    "only some ten percent of optically identified quasars are strong radio sources .",
    "but , it has now been more than half a century since we have divided quasars into the two classes of radio loud and radio quiet quasars , and it has still not been clear if there are two distinct populations or rather whether the radio loud population is merely the extreme end of a continuous distribution of radio luminosity .",
    "proponents of each interpretation claim that the other interpretation is due to selection effects .    many of the previous investigations designed to distinguish between radio loud and radio quiet quasars were limited by contamination from low luminosity agn with absolute optical magnitudes greater than -23 , biased samples based on radio rather than optical selection criteria , and inadequate sensitivity to detect radio emission from most of the radio quiet population .    in an attempt to overcome these limitations , kimball et al .",
    "@xcite observed 179 quasars selected from the sdss .",
    "all of the these quasars were within the redshift range 0.2 to 0.3 and were brighter than @xmath19 = -23 so were genuine quasars that presumably contained a smbh .",
    "the observations were made with the jansky very large array at 6 ghz reaching an rms noise of 6 @xmath20jy .",
    "all but about 6 quasars were detected as radio sources with an observed radio luminosity sharply peaked between @xmath21 and @xmath22 watts / hz characteristic of the radio luminosity typically observed from star forming galaxies .",
    "about ten percent of the sdss sample are strong radio sources with radio luminosities ranging up to @xmath23 w / hz .",
    "kimball et al . concluded that the radio emission from radio quiet quasars is due to star formation in the host galaxy .",

    "based on radio , optical , ir , and x - ray data , padovani et al . concluded that the microjy radio emission from agn , like that of galaxies , is powered primarily by starbursts , and not the smbhs which powers the agn .",
    "condon et al .",
    "@xcite argue that these starbursts are fueled by the same gas that flows into the smbh that powers the quasar and thus accounts for the co - evolution of star formation and smbhs .",
