    "the ly@xmath0  forest seen in quasar spectra probes the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the underlying matter distribution over a wide range of scales ( @xmath6 ) and redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "measurements of the mean flux in the ly@xmath0  forest shed light on the reionization history and the physical state of the igm in the post - reionization area ( press , & rybicki & schneider 1993 , hereafter p93 ; rauch 1997 ; bernardi 2003 , hereafter b03 ; bolton & haehnelt 2006 ) .",
    "fluctuations in the ly@xmath0  flux are of great interest since they provide information on the matter distribution on scales smaller than those accessible to other observables ( e.g. croft 1998 ; 1999 ; 2002b ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ; 2000 ; pichon 2002 ; zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2003 ; mcdonald 2000 ; mcdonald 2005a ) . combined with cmb observations ,",
    "the power spectrum of the ly@xmath0   forest can provide stringent constraints on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum ( seljak 2004 ; viel & haehnelt 2005 ) .    the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux was first studied by jenkins & ostriker ( 1991 ) .",
    "it has , however , received less attention in the past years as it is more sensitive to systematics errors such as continuum fitting uncertainties .",
    "yet , the tension between the wmap and ly@xmath0  values of the normalisation amplitude @xmath8 argues in favour of incorporating statistics others than the ly@xmath0  flux power spectrum .",
    "rauch 1997 and mcdonald ( 2000 ) have computed the pdf of the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux from high resolution data and found that @xmath9cdm cosmologies provide a good fit to the observations .",
    "gaztaaga & croft ( 1999 ) have provided an analytic description of the ly@xmath0  flux pdf based on perturbation theory .",
    "choudhury , srianand & padmanabhan ( 2001 ) , and desjacques & nusser ( 2005 ) have investigated the constraints obtained from a joint fit of the pdf and power spectrum of the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux .",
    "becker , rauch & sargent ( 2006 ) have examined the redshift evolution of the flux ly@xmath0  pdf from a large sample of keck hires data .",
    "note also that lidz ( 2005 ) have advocated working with the pdf of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean as it is insensitive to the quasar continuum .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york 2000 ) has greatly increased the statistical power of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to exploit the data are plagued by a number of poorly constrained parameters that describe the physical state of the igm , by inaccuracies in the numerical modelling of the ly@xmath0  forest , and by systematics errors in the measurement such as continuum fitting uncertainties .",
    "the observed flux in the ly@xmath0  region of a quasar ( qso ) spectrum depends both on the quasar continuum ( the flux emitted by the quasar , including the emission lines ) and on the amount of absorption by intervening galactic matter ( lines and continuum absorptions ) .",
    "the transmitted ( or normalized ) flux obtained by continuum fitting of the observed spectrum is related to the optical depth along the line of sight as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the optical depth , @xmath12 is the redshift space coordinate along the line of sight , @xmath13 is the observed flux and @xmath14 is the flux emitted from the source ( quasar ) that would be observed in the absence of any intervening material . to estimate the unabsorbed continuum , two different approaches have been used .",
    "when the signal - to - noise is large , a polynomial continuum is fitted to regions of the ly@xmath0  forest free of absorption ( e.g. rauch 1997 ; mcdonald 2000 ) . when the signal - to - noise is low , one usually extrapolate the continuum redward of the ly@xmath0  emission line , assuming a power law shape .",
    "the last method only provides an approximation to the true continuum , and can easily introduce several types of systematic errors ( e.g. steidel & sargent 1987 ) .",
    "the strong degeneracy between the effective optical depth @xmath15 and the continuum level affects the determination of the clustering amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "measurements of the effective optical depth from low resolution quasar spectra with comparable signal - to - noise ( p93 ; b03 ) are systematically higher than those based on high - resolution spectra by 10 - 20 per cent .",
    "as argued by seljak ( 2003 ) , tytler ( 2004 ) , viel ( 2004b ) , this is most likely due to systematic errors in the continuum fitting procedure of the low resolution spectra .",
    "furthermore , the low signal - to - noise of sdss spectra in the ly@xmath0  region ( @xmath16 typically ) requires an accurate noise estimate .",
    "systematic errors in the noise characterisation will affect the accuracy of the measurements . in this respect ,",
    "several lines of recent evidence suggest that the sdss reduction pipeline underestimates the true noise by 5 - 10 per cent ( mcdonald 2006 ; burgess 2004 ) .    in this paper , we measure the pdf of the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux from a large ( public ) sample of quasars included in the sdss dr3 data release ( abazajian 2005 ) .",
    "we assume that the quasar continuum follows the parametric form given in b03 .",
    "however , unlike b03 , we also allow for the variation in the continuum indices of individual spectra and fit a power law continuum for each spectrum separately .",
    "we compare our measurements to the probability distribution obtained from lognormal , realistic looking sdss spectra .",
    "the statistical properties of these mock spectra are beforehand constrained to match the observed ly@xmath0  flux probability distribution and power spectrum of high resolution data of the forest .",
    "our intention is to investigate the sensitivity of the ly@xmath0  flux pdf as measured from low resolution , low signal - to - noise data to a number of systematic errors such as uncertainties in the mean flux , continuum and noise estimate .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we briefly review the lognormal model of the ly@xmath0  forest in section   [ sec : lya ] .",
    "the constraints on the model parameters are discussed in   [ sec : param ] .",
    "the continuum fitting procedure and the measurement of the pdf of the ly@xmath0  flux are presented in   [ sec : data ] . in   [ sec : constrain ] , we compare the simulated and observed pdf , and study the effect of a number of systematic errors .",
    "we discuss our results in   [ sec : discussion ] . in   [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and indicate potential future works . we will present results for a @xmath9cdm cosmology with normalisation amplitude @xmath17 , and spectral index @xmath18 .",
    "this is consistent with the constraints obtained from the latest cmb and ly@xmath0  forest data ( spergel 2006 ; viel , haehnelt & lewis 2006 ; seljak , slosar & mcdonald 2006 ) .",
    "we implement the lognormal model introduced by bi and collaborators ( bi , brner & chu 1992 ; bi 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ; see also choudhury , padmanabhan & srianand 2001 ; viel 2002 ) to simulate the distribution of low - column density ly@xmath0  absorption lines along the los to quasars .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure is that simulated spectra can have an arbitrary large length .",
    "this allows us to eliminate periodicity effects that are present in simulations , where the typical box size is noticeably smaller than the total length of a single spectrum .",
    "furthermore , this approach is computationally very efficient as compared to n - body simulations .      the lognormal model of the igm is based on the assumption that the low - column density ly@xmath0  forest is produced by mildly nonlinear fluctuations ( @xmath19 ) which smoothly trace the dark matter distribution .",
    "the igm density contrast @xmath20 is obtained from a local mapping of the linear igm density contrast @xmath21 ( coles & jones 1991 ) , but the igm peculiar velocity along the line of sight is assumed to be linear even on scales where the density contrast gets non - linear ( bi & davidsen 1997 )   if one neglects the coupling @xmath22 . ] .",
    "we have namely @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rms fluctuations of the linear igm density field at redshift @xmath25 .",
    "the linear igm density and peculiar velocity , @xmath21 and @xmath26 , are obtained by smoothing the linear matter density and velocity distribution on some characteristic scale @xmath27 to mimic pressure smoothing .",
    "the linear igm clustering amplitude , @xmath28 , is thus @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the linear density growth factor , @xmath31 is the dimensionless , linear matter power spectrum at the present epoch ( peebles 1980 ) and @xmath32 is the igm filter .",
    "we take the @xmath33-space filter @xmath34 to be a gaussian .",
    "such a filter gives a good fit to the gas fluctuations over a wide range of wavenumber ( gnedin 2003 ; see also zaroubi 2005 ) . in principle",
    ", we expect @xmath35 to depend on the physical state of the igm . however , since the relation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 depends noticeably on the reionization history of the universe ( gnedin & hui 1998 ; nusser 2000 ) , it is more convenient to treat @xmath35 as a free parameter .",
    "we calculate the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux @xmath37 in the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( gunn & peterson 1965 , bahcall & salpeter 1965 ) .",
    "the optical depth for ly@xmath0  resonant scattering at some redshift space position @xmath38 is expressed as a convolution of the real space  density along the line of sight with a voigt profile @xmath39 , @xmath40\\ ; . \\label{eq : depth}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the effective cross - section for resonant line scattering , h@xmath42 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath25 , @xmath43 is the real space coordinate , @xmath44 is the neutral hydrogen density , @xmath45 is the doppler parameter due to thermal / turbulent broadening and @xmath46 is the voigt profile , which can be approximated by a gaussian for moderate optical depths . the  hydrogen density , @xmath44 , and the doppler parameter , @xmath45 , are computed using a tight polytropic relation ( katz 1996 , hui & gnedin 1997 , theuns 1998 ) that produces results comparable to full hydrodynamical simulations , @xmath47 where the adiabatic index @xmath48 is in the range @xmath49 . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the  hydrogen density and doppler parameter at mean gas density respectively . the latter is a function of the igm temperature , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the igm temperature at mean density ( in unit of @xmath54 ) .",
    "note that , since @xmath50 is usually constrained by fixing the mean flux level , @xmath55 , we will treat @xmath55 as a free parameter in the remaining of this paper .",
    "we simulate the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux in a periodic line of sight of comoving length @xmath56 at @xmath57 discrete @xmath58-space position @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "following bi ( 1993 ) , we generate two fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 at discrete @xmath33-space positions .",
    "the two fields are correlated gaussian random fields that can be written as linear combination of two independent fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 having ( dimensionless ) power spectra @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the linear growth factor of the velocity field .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath69 are constrained by the auto- and cross - correlations of the density and velocity fields , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the 3d and 1d power spectra , respectively .",
    "we obtain the linear igm density and peculiar velocity field in @xmath58-space from a fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and calculate the mean transmitted flux by combining equations ( [ eq : lg ] ) , ( [ eq : depth ] ) and ( [ eq : hi ] ) . for a given cosmological model ,",
    "the flux distribution depends only on the filtering wavenumber @xmath35 , the mean flux @xmath55 , the adiabatic index @xmath48 and the mean igm temperature @xmath53 .      to create realistic mock spectra , we compute the flux distribution on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) grid whose resolution @xmath73 is fine enough to resolve the smallest structure on the filtering scale , and whose length @xmath56 is long enough to incorporate most of the fluctuation power .",
    "we typically have @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( comoving ) .",
    "we constrain the mean flux level @xmath55 from a large sample of idealised , noise - free spectra .",
    "instrumental resolution , noise and strong absorption systems are included as described below .",
    "note that , in low resolution spectra , @xmath55 will generally differ from the `` effective '' mean flux @xmath76 of the processed spectra , which include a number of strong absorption systems .",
    "we attempt to include instrumental noise and resolution in our synthetic spectra in a way that mimics the observations as much as possible ( e.g. rauch 1997 ) .",
    "we smooth the spectra with a gaussian of constant width , and re - sample them on pixels of wavelength size @xmath77 , interpolating between adjacent values in the fine grid .",
    "the spectra are not modified to include continuum fitting uncertainties as the latter are taken out from the observed spectra .    in the high resolution spectra ,",
    "the transmitted flux is convolved with a gaussian of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath78 , and re - sampled on pixels of wavelength size @xmath79 . in units of @xmath80 ,",
    "the resolution varies from @xmath81 at @xmath82 to @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "further , gaussian noise is added to each pixel with an amplitude given by a flux - dependent rms noise per pixel , @xmath85 , as measured in m00 ( see their table 3 ) .    in the low resolution spectra",
    ", we adopt a fwhm of @xmath86 ( i.e. a dispersion of @xmath87 ) , and re - sample the flux on a uniform grid with @xmath88 .",
    "the low signal - to - noise of the sdss spectra in the ly@xmath0  region requires an accurate description of the noise . the true error on each pixel in each quasar spectrum",
    "is essentially made up of the poisson noise from photon counts , the ccd read - noise and systematics errors from sky subtraction .",
    "mcdonald ( 2006 ) have outlined a procedure which follows closely the spectroscopic data reduction pipeline .",
    "the inconvenience of this method is that it requires a sky - flux estimate . here",
    ", we simply assume that the noise distribution is gaussian whose rms variance is given by the sdss data reduction pipeline .",
    "although the latter computes a variance for each flux pixel , there is some evidence that these error estimates do not perfectly reflect the true errors in the data ( bolton 2004 ; mcdonald 2006 ; burgess 2004 ) .",
    "mcdonald ( 2006 ) and burgess ( 2004 ) have recalibrated the noise of their spectra by differencing multiple exposures , and found that the rms noise variance given by the sdss pipeline is underestimated by resp .",
    "8 and 5 per cent on average",
    ". we will hereafter refer to @xmath89 as the fiducial ( pipeline ) noise estimate .",
    "the sensitivity of the mock spectra to the noise level will be discussed in detail in   [ sub : sens ] . given the relatively broad distribution of pixel noise variances at fixed flux @xmath90",
    ", we use the full set of rms noise variances from the data points with @xmath91 .",
    "we then map with repetition the individual noise estimates onto the pixels @xmath91 in the idealized mock spectra ( e.g. burgess 2004 ) .",
    "our mapping accounts for the fact that the mean pixel noise increases with redshift ( see figure  [ fig : pix ] ) .",
    "high column density systems associated with collapsed objects such as disk galaxies are not reproduced in the lognormal model ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "large column densities are needed ( @xmath92 ) to produce the strong damping wings of the observed absorption line profile . in the high - resolution data ,",
    "damped ly@xmath0  systems ( dlas ) are removed by eliminating wavelength intervals containing these absorption lines from the spectra .",
    "these strong absorption lines are , however , present in our sample of sdss spectra .",
    "we , therefore , include a set of dlas and lyman limit systems ( lss ) in the low resolution mock spectra .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in mcdonald ( 2005b ) , which is based on the self - shielding model of zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002 ) . the column density distribution of these strong absorbers is then normalised to reproduce the observations of peroux 2003 and prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe ( 2005 ) . as the doppler parameter distribution of the strong absorption systems is largely unknown , we use a single value of 30@xmath80 at all redshifts .",
    "in this section , we constrain the model parameters from a comparison between the flux power spectrum ( ps ) and probability distribution ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux of mock and observed high resolution spectra .",
    "desjacques & nusser ( 2005 ) have pointed out that models that match best the ps alone do not necessarily yield a good fit to the pdf .",
    "it is therefore important to combine the ps and pdf statistics to ensure that both are correctly reproduced in the lognormal spectra .",
    "we perform a @xmath93 statistical test for the observed flux power spectrum and pdf to determine quantitatively the values of the parameter required to fit high resolution measurements of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "we use the measurements of mcdonald ( 2000 ) , which were obtained from a sample of eight high resolution qso spectra .",
    "results are provided for three redshift bins centered at @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . regarding the flux power spectrum",
    ", we consider the data points in the range @xmath97 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath98 is chosen so as to avoid continuum fitting errors ( hui 2001 ) , and the upper limit @xmath99 is chosen to avoid metal contamination on smaller scales ( kim 2004 ) .",
    "the observed flux pdf is very sensitive to continuum fitting , especially in the high transmissivity tail ( e.g. meiksin , bryan & machacek 2001 ) .",
    "the modelling of these errors is complicated by the fact that the scales of interest are of the order of the box size @xmath56 of the simulations .",
    "however , m00 demonstrate that , if the inclusion of continuum fitting errors can account for most of the discrepancy between the simulated and observed pdf in the range @xmath100 , it should not greatly affect the pdf for @xmath101 .",
    "we , therefore , exclude the data points with @xmath102 from the analysis to avoid dealing with those errors .",
    "the m00 measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : best ] as the filled symbols .",
    "the shaded areas indicate the data points used in this analysis is ( 10 + 15=25 measurements from the ps and pdf respectively ) .      for each value of the parameter vector @xmath103=(@xmath35,@xmath55,@xmath48,@xmath53 )",
    ", we generate mock catalogues of 1000 lines of sight .",
    "we let the filtering wavenumber , the igm adiabatic index and temperature assume the following values , @xmath104 irrespective of the redshift . the values of @xmath35 ( in unit of @xmath105 ) are chosen such that @xmath106 uniformly spans the range @xmath107 .",
    "the assumed effective optical depth @xmath108 or , equivalently , mean flux @xmath109 has a large impact on the simulated one- and two - point statistics of the forest .",
    "observations indicate that @xmath108 evolves strongly in the redshift range @xmath110 . in fig.[fig : mteff ] , we show several measurements of @xmath108 obtained from high resolution observations .",
    "empty triangles , squares and circles show the results of rauch ( 1997 ) and mcdonald ( 2000 ) for a comparable sample of hires spectra , whereas the empty circles indicate the estimates of the luqas sample of kim ( 2004 ) .",
    "the filled circle shows the measurements of tytler ( 2004 ) .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves indicate the evolution reported by kim ( 2002 ) and schaye ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that there is significant overlap among the quasar samples of schaye ( 2003 ) and kim ( 2004 ) .",
    "all these estimates have been obtained after removing damped / sub - damped ly@xmath0  systems and pixels contaminated by associated metal absorption .",
    "the measurements of @xmath108 are mostly affected by cosmic variance due to large variations between lines of sight , uncertainties in the continuum fitting procedure and the somewhat uncertain contribution from metal lines ( p93 ; zuo & bond 1994 ; rauch 1997 ; tytler 2004 ; viel 2004a ) .",
    "in particular , the continuum fitting generally adopted for high resolution data may result in an underestimation of the continuum and of @xmath108 ( kim 2001 ) .",
    "based on these measurements , we adopt the following values for the mean flux @xmath55  : @xmath111 ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath112 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath113 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "these intervals are shown as shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : mteff ] .",
    "although the effective optical depth appears to evolve smoothly with redshift , the behaviour of @xmath114 inferred from a large sample of sdss quasars is found to deviate from a power law around @xmath115 ( b03 ) , suggesting that reionizes in that redshift range ( theuns 2002b ; schaye 2000 ) .",
    "we use a spectral grid of @xmath116 pixels which are evenly spaced in wavelength ( @xmath117 ) . @xmath57 and @xmath73 are chosen so that the number of pixels in the `` degraded '' mock spectra is a constant power of 2 to facilitate the computation of fourier transforms .    for each mock catalogue",
    ", we calculate the flux power spectrum and the flux pdf .",
    "we determine the goodness of fit of any model in the grid by computing a @xmath93 statistic from the difference between the simulated ps and pdf and the observational data . in the calculation of the @xmath93",
    ", we neglect the correlations between measurements of the flux ps .",
    "however , in the case of the flux pdf , we include the full covariance matrix since these measuremements are highly correlated ( m00 ) .",
    "we take advantage of the smooth dependence of the flux ps and pdf on the parameter vector , and use cubic spline interpolation to find the best - fitting models .",
    ".parameter values of the models which best fit the ps and pdf inferred from high - resolution measurements of the ly@xmath0  forest .",

    "the filtering @xmath35 is in unit of @xmath105 .",
    "the last column gives the chi - squared for 23 degrees of freedom .",
    "note that , since we spline interpolate over the parameters , the best fit values do not necessarily lie at a grid point . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    in section   [ sec : param ] , we have constrained the model parameters from measurements of the flux ps and pdf which are fairly representative of the true statistics at redshift @xmath84 , 3 and 3.9 . however ,",
    "these measurements are averaged in relatively large redshift bins , over which the evolution of the ly@xmath0  forest is significant .",
    "it is , therefore , prudent to examine the extent to which our measurements of the pdf at redshift @xmath84 , 3 and 3.9 are sensitive to the adopted redshift intervals .",
    "we have thus computed the pdf of the transmitted flux for the redshift intervals adopted in m00 ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "the results are shown as dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdss2 ] .",
    "they are compared to our fiducial measurement of the probability distribution function obtained with a redshift interval @xmath122 ( solid curves ) .",
    "the difference is largest at @xmath82 , where the sharp decrease in the number of pixels at @xmath123 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pix ] ) and the strong increase in the flux over the range @xmath124 conspire to raise the average mean flux by 10 per cent . at @xmath84 , the height of the peak",
    "is decreased by about 10 per cent . obviously , the strength of the effect depends on the exact shape of the selection function ( see fig .  [",

    "interestingly , accounting for variation in the continuum slope has a noticeable impact on the pdf , especially on the average mean flux . for a fixed index @xmath125 , the mean flux at @xmath3 and 2.4",

    "we have also changed the interval defining the ly@xmath0  forest , and found that the measured pdf is robust to the wavelength range as long as intrinsic features to the quasar are excluded .",

    "however , the agreement is poor given the small error bars . at @xmath131 in particular , the peak in the flux probability distribution is significantly more pronounced in the mock pdf than in the observation .",
    "since the synthetic spectra have been constrained to reproduce the observed pdf and ps measured in high resolution data , the shortcomings of the lognormal model are unlikely responsible for the difference between the observed and mock pdfs .",
    "the disagreement must originate either in the transformation of the idealised mocks into realistic looking sdss spectra , or in the measurement of the ly@xmath0  flux probability distribution of the sdss sample .",

    "we confirm the results of mcdonald ( 2005b ) who find that the ly@xmath0  forest is not very sensitive to the details of the strong absorption lines , except when the damping wings become important .",
    "regarding the presence of metal lines , the typical metallicity of the low - density igm remains largely unknown , although early statistical analysis based on pixel optical depth methods seemed to indicate that there is civ and ovi associated with the low - column density ly@xmath0  forest ( cowie & songaila 1998 ; ellison 2000 ; schaye 2000a ) .",
    "more recent studies appear to refute these claims , and suggest that the volume filling fraction of metals is small , @xmath138 per cent , in the redshift range @xmath139 ( pieri & haehnelt 2003 ; aracil 2004 ) .",
    "clearly , at redshift @xmath140 , absorption in the ly@xmath0  forest region is strongly dominated by the ly@xmath0  resonant transition , and the impact of metals on the flux pdf is likely to be negligible . at lower redshift",
    "however , metals contribute more significantly to the absorption . from a sample of quasars at mean redshift @xmath141 , tytler ( 2004 )",
    "have estimated that metal lines absorb @xmath42.5 per cent of the flux in the ly@xmath0  forest .",

    "[ fig : pdf2 ] illustrates the sensitivity of the flux probability distribution to the amount of noise .",
    "the solid curve shows the mock pdf obtained with our default noise level @xmath89 given by the sdss reduction pipeline ( cf .  ",

    "the dashed curve shows the pdf when the noise is set to zero . the large pipeline noise smoothes the idealized , noise - free pdf significantly",
    "a few per cent change in @xmath89 noticeably affects the shape of the pdf . in this respect , at @xmath142 , increasing @xmath89 would lower the peak , and bring the pdf in better agreement with the observations .",

    "[ fig : pix ] shows that the distribution of signal - to - noise in our sample is broad . to assess the extent to which the shape of the measured pdf is affected by the noise level , we split the sample based on the mean signal - to - noise in the ly@xmath0  forest .",

    "is plotted with errorbars .",
    "cosmic variance errors have been computed separately for both subsamples , which include approximately the same number of data points ( @xmath146 pixels ) .",
    "the upper right panels show that the peak height of the observed flux probability distribution of low @xmath145 spectra is larger at @xmath3 than at @xmath84 , while high @xmath145 spectra show the opposite trend .",
    "this is presumably due to the large noise which dominates the signal , and gives the pdf a nearly gaussian shape .",
    "since the sdss spectral resolution varies in the range @xmath147 , we have also computed the pdf with an lower instrumental resolution of 150@xmath80 ( fwhm ) . at @xmath131 , a decrease of @xmath148 10 per cent in the instrumental resolution",
    "has a relatively small impact on the flux probability distribution .",
    "decreasing the mean flux , accounting for metal lines or increasing the noise level in the mock spectra can only partly account for the difference between the observed and simulated pdf .    in the data , the main sources of systematic errors are inaccuracies in the continuum fitting of the spectra . given the large degeneracy between the amount of absorption and the continuum level in the ly@xmath0  region , it is unclear whether the single power law approximation can be extended shortward of the ly@xmath0  emission line .",
    "low redshift spectroscopic measurements show indeed that there is a break around @xmath149 in the slope of the mean quasar continuum .",
    "they indicate that the continuum turns over in that rest frame region , from @xmath150 longward of the break to @xmath151 shortward ( e.g. zheng 1997 ; telfer 2002 ) .",
    "the exact location of the break is , however , difficult to determine due to the presence of emission lines .",
    "this turnover is neither accounted for in the continuum extrapolation method of p93 and b03 , nor in our procedure . as noticed by by kim ( 2001 ) and meiksin , bryan & machacek ( 2001 )",
    ", this may lead to an underestimation of @xmath55 that could be as large as @xmath152 per cent ( seljak , mcdonald & makarov 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , we will now relax the assumption of a single power law .",
    "since there are large uncertainties in the behaviour of the continuum blueward of 1216 , we have not looked for a parametric form of the turnover .",
    "instead , we have simply assumed that the true continuum is a rescaled version of our fiducial continuum @xmath153 , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a mean correction factor which we will attempt to constrain .",

    "note that the errors in the observed transmitted flux depend on the continuum level , as @xmath157 .",
    "the 10 per cent decrease in the continuum translates into a comparable increase in the observed mean flux , which is now @xmath158 and 0.80 at @xmath3 and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "notwithstanding this , the peak in the simulated pdf is still more pronounced than in the observed pdf .",
    "a further decrease of the continuum does not improve the agreement .",
    "in fact , unless the actual mean flux is significantly lower than that inferred from high resolution data , a substantial increase in the noise level is needed to reproduce the smooth shape of the observed pdf .    the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf3 ] demonstrates that the agreement with the data is substantially improved if the pipeline noise is increased by @xmath420 per cent .",
    "the agreement is however better at @xmath3 than at @xmath84 , where the mock pdf still appears to be shifted to larger values of @xmath90 when compared to the observed pdf .",

    "the correction factor @xmath155 that quantifies the deviation from a power law is expected to vary from spectrum to spectrum .",
    "it also probably depends on the rest frame wavelength @xmath160 .",
    "using a constant value of @xmath155 smoothes the flux probability distribution as compared to the `` true '' pdf , thereby mimicking the effect of a larger noise .",
    "we have found that the introduction of a 10 per cent scatter ( gaussian deviate ) in the continuum level of @xmath3 mock spectra smoothes the flux pdf on a level comparable to a 20 per cent increase in the noise . at @xmath84 ,",
    "this corresponds to an even larger increase in the noise , presumably because the average signal - to - noise is lower .",
    "therefore , an increase in the mean noise level can account for both a larger noise per pixel and variations in the continuum .",

    "they have found that the sdss pipeline underestimates the true errors by 5 - 10 per cent on average .",
    "although we do not have access to additional exposures , we can take advantage of the relative smoothness of the spectra redward of the ly@xmath0  emission line , and estimate the noise in , e.g. , the rest - frame wavelength interval 1450 - 1470  as the rms variance @xmath172 of the flux around the continuum .",

    "it is unclear to which extent @xmath174 reflects the excess noise contribution in the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "however , the fact that mcdonald ( 2006 ) find the same excess noise power in the region 1268 - 1380  as they do in the ly@xmath0  forest suggests that the fraction of extra noise does not depend strongly on @xmath160 .",
    "consequently , the 50 per cent increase in the noise level most probably arises from residual variations in the continua of quasars that are not accounted for by our spectrum - to - spectrum continuum fitting . in",

    ". a combined fit of the sdss and keck data indicates that a decrease of 10 - 15 per cent in the amplitude of the power law continuum together with a 20 per cent scatter can account for the data , provided that the noise excess correction is no larger than @xmath14810 per cent .",
    "measuring the probability distribution of the transmitted flux requires a spectrum - by - spectrum treatment of the quasar continuum , as the latter varies significantly from quasar to quasar .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen , it is crucial to account for the slow variation of the continuum slope in the ly@xmath0  region in order to obtain a sensible estimate of the flux probability distribution .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to obtain high resolution exposures of a subsample of sdss quasars so as to quantify the errors introduced by the continuum fitting procedure described in this paper .",
    "alternatively , lidz ( 2005 ) have suggested working with the estimator defined by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 is the observed flux smoothed with a gaussian filter on scale @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",

    "<S> we present a measurement of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0  forest from a sample of 3492 quasars included in the sdss dr3 data release . </S>",
    "<S> our intention is to investigate the sensitivity of the ly@xmath0  flux pdf as measured from low resolution and low signal - to - noise data to a number of systematic errors such as uncertainties in the mean flux , continuum and noise estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar continuum is described by the superposition of a power law and emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a power law continuum fitting on a spectrum - by - spectrum basis , and obtain an average continuum slope of @xmath1 in the redshift range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the variation in the continuum indices increases the mean flux by 3 and 7 per cent at @xmath3 and 2.4 , respectively , as compared to the values inferred with a single ( mean ) continuum slope . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our measurements to the pdf obtained with mock lognormal spectra , whose statistical properties have been constrained to match the observed ly@xmath0  flux pdf and power spectrum of high resolution data . using our power law continuum fitting and </S>",
    "<S> the sdss pipeline noise estimate yields a poor agreement between the observed and mock pdfs . allowing for a break in the continuum slope and , more importantly , for residual scatter in the continuum level </S>",
    "<S> substantially improves the agreement . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of @xmath410 - 15 per cent in the mean quasar continuum with a typical rms variance at the 20 per cent level can account for the data , provided that the noise excess correction is no larger than @xmath5 per cent .    </S>",
