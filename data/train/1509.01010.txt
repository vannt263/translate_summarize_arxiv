    "in astrophysics , hypothesis testing is ubiquitous , because progress is made by comparing competing models to experimental data . in the special case , where new physical phenomena are searched for , the most common choice of hypothesis test is the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) , whose popularity is partly motivated by the fact that , assuming @xmath1 is true , the asymptotic distribution of the lrt statistic is a @xmath2 .",
    "such result holds if the regularity conditions specified in wilks s theorem hold @xcite .",
    "a key necessary condition is  nested - ness \" , meaning that there is a full model of which both the models under @xmath1 and the alternative hypothesis , @xmath3 , are special cases .",
    "this is obviously the case for the search for new particles where the null hypothesis ( or baseline model ) , @xmath1 , is given by  background \" and @xmath3 is given by ",
    "background+signal of new particle \" .",
    "however , cases where model comparison is non - nested are common : for instance , when a known astrophysical signal can be confused with new physics , see @xcite for an example from astroparticle physics , or if the models to be compared reside in different parameter spaces @xcite ; as in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in these situations , monte carlo simulations of the measurement process are often the only possibility , but are challenged by stringent significance requirements , e.g. , at the @xmath4 level .",
    "we present a solution that allows evaluation of accurate statistical significances for non - nested model comparison while avoiding extensive monte carlo simulations . as a concrete example",
    ", we apply the proposed procedure to the search for particle dark matter , where the method has particular importance .",
    "one way to search for dark matter is to consider its hypothesized annihilation products , i.e. , @xmath0-rays , that can be detected by space borne or ground based @xmath0-rays telescopes @xcite . here",
    ", the issue of source confusion is one of the most challenging aspects of claiming discovery of a dark matter induced signal .",
    "a detected excess of @xmath0-rays may either originate from dark matter annihilation or be caused by conventional , known astrophysical sources .",
    "discrimination can be performed using their spectral distributions , however these are not necessarily part of the same parameter space ( see below ) .",
    "this situation arises for example in the search for dark matter sources among the unidentified sources found by fermi - lat @xcite , the claimed detection of a signal consistent with dark matter in our own galaxy , which has gained much attention recently @xcite , or ( once a detection has been made ) in the search for dark matter in dwarf galaxies @xcite . in the recent claims ,",
    "the existence of a source of @xmath0-rays ( over some background ) is established by a lrt , but the crucial and unsolved question is not whether a @xmath0-ray source exists , but whether it can be explained by conventional sources of @xmath0-rays as opposed to dark matter annihilation .",
    "this is a prime example of an non - nested model comparison . for definiteness , we can assume @xmath5 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of the @xmath0-rays energies , denoted by @xmath6 , originating from known cosmic sources and @xmath7 is the pdf of the @xmath0-ray energies of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the goal is to decide if @xmath8 is sufficient to explain the data ( @xmath1 ) or if @xmath9 ( @xmath3 ) provides a better fit .",
    "although the issue of comparing non - nested models has been addressed since the early days of modern statistics @xcite , as well as in the more recent physical literature @xcite , a method with the desired statistical properties , easy implementation and computational efficiency in astrophysics is still lacking .    this article is arranged as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] reviews the lrt , wilks s theorem and their extensions to non - regular situations .",
    "our proposal for testing non - tested models is introduced in section  [ sec3 ] , validated via simulation studies in section  [ sec4 ] , and applied to a realistic simulation of the fermi - lat @xmath0-ray satellite in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "general discussion appears in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be pdfs of the background and signal , where @xmath6 is the detected energy , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are parameters .",
    "suppose observed particles are a mixture of background and source , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the proportion of signal counts .",

    "are :    1 .",
    "the models are nested , meaning that there is a full model of which both @xmath1 and @xmath3 are special cases .",
    "the set of possible parameters of @xmath1 is on the interior of that for the full model .",
    "3 .   the full model is identifiable under @xmath1 .    unfortunately in practice , it is common to encounter non - regular problems .",
    "notice for example , if @xmath13 is known but @xmath26 , rc2 does not hold . in this case",
    ", @xcite applies ; it generalizes wilks and states that if @xmath1 is on the boundary of the parameter space , the asymptotic distribution of @xmath24 is an equal mixture of a @xmath25 and a dirac delta function at 0 , namely @xmath27 .",
    "further , if @xmath26 ( on the boundary ) and @xmath13 is unknown , the model in is not identifiable under @xmath1 and rc3 fails .",
    "this is known in statistics as a test of hypothesis where a nuisance parameter is defined only under @xmath3 , or  trial correction \" in astrophysical literature .",

    "if both rc2 and rc3 fail to hold ( e.g. , the important case of @xmath26 with @xmath13 unknown ) , we show in our supplementary material that because @xmath28 is a @xmath27 random process , @xmath32e^{-\\frac{c - c_0}{2 } } % \\end{small}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 $ ] is the expected number of upcrossings of the @xmath24 process over the threshold @xmath34 under @xmath1 and @xmath34 is chosen @xmath35 .",

    "although this approximation holds as @xmath30 , when @xmath36 is small , the right hand side of is an upper bound for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , basing inference on is valid , though perhaps conservative .",
    "suppose we wish to compare two pdfs , @xmath37 and @xmath11 , for which rc1 does not apply , that is the two pdfs are not special cases of a full model and do not share a parameter space .",
    "notice that in both @xmath38 and @xmath39 free parameters ( i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) are present and thus , the problem can not be reduced to a test for simple hypotheses as in @xcite , see @xcite for more details .",
    "we require @xmath13 to be one dimensional and @xmath12 to lie in the interior of its parameter space .",
    "the goal is to develop a test of the hypothesis : @xmath40    although @xmath37 and @xmath11 are non - nested , we can construct a comprehensive model which includes both as special cases .",
    "there are two reasonable formulations .",
    "we encountered the first in ; the second is proportional to @xmath41 , with @xmath42 in both formulations .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , there are advantages and disadvantages to both . from our perspective , the additive form in has the advantage of more appealing mathematical properties .",
    "since no normalizing constant is involved , the maximization of the log - likelihood reduces to numerical optimization .",
    "in contrast to the test discussed in section [ sec2 ] , the model in is not viewed as a mixture of astrophysical models in which a certain proportion of events , @xmath23 , originates a process represented by one model , and the the remaining proportion , @xmath43 , originates from the completing process represented by the other model . instead , is a mathematical formalization used to embed the pdfs @xmath44 and @xmath11 and their corresponding parameters spaces into an overarching model via the auxiliary parameter @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the overarching model has not astrophysical interpretation , but helps us reformulate the test in into a suitable form , i.e. , @xmath45    perhaps a more natural formulation of would be @xmath46 versus @xmath47 . unfortunately , neither wilks s or chernoff s theorems apply to this formulation since they rely on the asymptotic normality of the mle under @xmath1 , which can only hold if there is a continuum of possible values of @xmath23 under @xmath3 , with @xmath48 in its interior . with indirect dark matter detection ,",
    "the formulation in allows the alternative model to include both the case where dark matter and known cosmic sources are present simoultaneously ( @xmath49 ) and the case where only dark matter is present ( @xmath50 ) . in situations where intermediate values of @xmath23 are not physical we might , in addition to , test @xmath51 versus @xmath52 , i.e. , interchange the roles of the hypotheses as discussed in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the nuisance parameter @xmath12 is required to be one dimensional i.e. , @xmath53 .    under model ,",
    "testing is equivalent to testing @xmath23 on the boundary with @xmath13 only being defined under the alternative .",
