    "it is widely believed that as the temperature and/or density increase , strongly interacting matter undergoes some kind of transition from a hadronic phase , in which chiral symmetry is broken and quarks are confined , to a partonic phase in which chiral symmetry is restored and/or quarks are deconfined .",
    "the detailed understanding of this phenomenon is relevant not only in particle physics but also e.g.  in the the study of the early universe , the interior of neutron stars , etc .",
    ", therefore it has become an issue of great interest in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , one way to address this problem is through lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , even if significant improvements have been done in this field in the last years , this ab initio approach is not yet able to provide a full understanding of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "one serious difficulty in this sense is given by the so - called sign problem , which prevents straightforward simulations at finite baryon density .",
    "in this situation it is worth to develop alternative approaches , such as the study of effective models that show consistency with lattice qcd results and can be extrapolated into regions not accessible by lattice techniques . here",
    "we will concentrate on one particular class of effective theories , namely the so - called nonlocal polyakov@xmath0nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( nlpnjl ) models  @xcite , in which quarks move in a background color field and interact through covariant nonlocal chirally symmetric four point couplings .",
    "related polyakov - dyson - schwinger equation models have also been recently analyzed  @xcite .",
    "these approaches , which can be considered as an improvement over the ( local ) pnjl model  @xcite , offer a common framework to study both the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions .",
    "in fact , the nonlocal character of the interactions arises naturally in the context of several successful approaches to low - energy quark dynamics  @xcite , and leads to a momentum dependence in the quark propagator that can be made consistent  @xcite with lattice results  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been found that , under certain conditions , it is possible to derive the main features of nlpnjl models starting directly from qcd  @xcite . from the phenomenological side ,",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that nonlocal models provide a satisfactory description of hadron properties at zero temperature and density .    as mentioned above , it is important to consider situations in which the results obtained within effective models can be compared with available lattice qcd calculations .",
    "for example , it is clear that vacuum properties such as the pion mass and decay constant , as well as other features related to the chiral / deconfinement transitions ( like e.g.  the nature of the transitions , or the critical temperatures ) will depend on basic parameters of qcd , such as the number of quark flavors and the values of current quark masses @xmath1 . in particular , for the simplified case of two degenerate flavors with @xmath2 , the dependence of several relevant quantities on @xmath3 has been studied with some detail in lattice qcd .",
    "thus , the corresponding analysis within nlpnjl models can provide an interesting test of the reliability of this effective approach .",
    "actually , it has already been shown that several chiral effective models  @xcite are not able to reproduce the behavior of the critical temperatures observed in lattice qcd when one varies the parameters that explicitly break chiral symmetry ( i.e.the current quark masses , or the pion mass in the case of meson models ) at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "this fact has been taken as an indication that the transition may be not just dominated by pure chiral dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that in the framework of the standard ( local ) njl model the enhancement of the critical temperature with @xmath3 is too strong in comparison with lattice qcd estimates .",
    "although the inclusion of confinement effects through the coupling to the polyakov loop weakens this enhancement , one finds a too large splitting between the chiral restoration and deconfinement transition temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the presence of confinement effects together with a strong entanglement between the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions is indeed one of the features of nlpnjl models  @xcite .    in view of the above",
    "mentioned points , the aim of the present work is to study the effect of explicit chiral symmetry breaking on the deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures within nlpnjl models .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we provide a description of the model , proposing two alternative parameterizations . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the @xmath3-dependence of some pion properties and compare the results with existing lattice calculations . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the current quark mass dependence of the critical temperatures at vanishing chemical potential , comparing our results with those obtained in alternative models and lattice qcd . finally in sec .",
    "v we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "we consider a nonlocal su(2 ) chiral quark model that includes quark couplings to the color gauge fields .",
    "the corresponding euclidean effective action is given by  @xcite @xmath4 + \\",
    "{ \\cal u}\\,(\\phi[a(x)])\\right\\ }   \\ , \\label{action}%\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 fermion doublet @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the current quark mass matrix . in what follows we consider isospin symmetry , @xmath2 . the fermion kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) includes a covariant derivative @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are color gauge fields , and the operator @xmath11 in euclidean space is defined as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the nonlocal currents @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ currents ] ) are nonlocal covariant form factors characterizing the corresponding interactions . notice that the four currents @xmath20 require a common form factor @xmath18 in order to guarantee chiral invariance , while the coupling @xmath21 is self - invariant under chiral transformations .",
    "the scalar - isoscalar component of the @xmath22 current will generate a momentum dependent quark mass in the quark propagator , while the `` momentum '' current @xmath23 will be responsible for a momentum dependent quark wave function renormalization .",
    "now we perform a bosonization of the theory , introducing bosonic fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and integrating out the quark fields .",
    "details of this procedure as well as of the determination of vacuum and meson properties at vanishing temperature in this framework can be found e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures , we extend the bosonized effective action to finite temperature @xmath26 .",
    "this can be done by using the standard matsubara formalism . concerning the gauge fields @xmath10 , we assume that quarks move on a constant background field @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are su(3 ) color gauge fields",
    ". then the traced polyakov loop , which in the infinite quark mass limit can be taken as an order parameter of confinement , is given by @xmath29 .",
    "we work in the so - called polyakov gauge , in which the matrix @xmath30 is given a diagonal representation @xmath31 .",
    "this leaves only two independent variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the case of vanishing chemical potential , owing to the charge conjugation properties of the qcd lagrangian ,",
    "the mean field traced polyakov loop is expected to be a real quantity . since @xmath32 and @xmath33 have to be real valued , this condition implies @xmath34 .",
    "the mean field traced polyakov loop reads then @xmath35/3 $ ] .",
    "thus in the mean field approximation , which will be used throughout this work , the thermodynamical potential @xmath36 at finite temperature and zero chemical potential is given by @xmath37 + \\frac{\\bar\\sigma_1 ^ 2 + \\kappa_p^2\\ ; \\bar\\sigma_2 ^ 2}{2\\,g_s } + { \\cal{u}}(\\phi , \\phi^*,t ) \\ , \\label{granp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 \\",

    "this yields  @xcite @xmath51 a second usual form is based on the logarithmic expression of the haar measure associated with the su(3 ) color group integration .",

    "( [ pol ] ) and ( [ log ] ) corresponds in principle to the deconfinement transition temperature in the pure yang - mills theory , @xmath56  mev .",
    "however , it has been argued that in the presence of light dynamical quarks this temperature scale should be adequately reduced  @xcite .",
    "finally , one has to take into account that @xmath36 turns out to be divergent , thus it has to be regularized . here",
    "we use the prescription described e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath57 where @xmath58 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ granp ] ) by setting @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the regularized expression for the quark thermodynamical potential in the absence of the four point fermion interaction , @xmath61 \\ , \\label{freeomegareg}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ omegareg ] ) is just a constant fixed by the condition that @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath64 .",
    "given the full form of the thermodynamical potential , the mean field values @xmath41 and @xmath65 can be obtained as solutions of the coupled set of `` gap equations '' @xmath66 once these mean field values are obtained , the behavior of other relevant quantities as functions of the temperature and chemical potential can be determined .",
    "we concentrate in particular in the chiral quark condensate @xmath67 and the traced polyakov loop @xmath68 , which will be taken as order parameters of the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions , respectively .",
    "the associated susceptibilities will be defined as @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    in order to fully specify the model under consideration",
    "we proceed to fix the model parameters as well as the nonlocal form factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 at the physical point @xmath73  mev .",
    "we consider two different functional dependences for the form factors .",
    "the first one corresponds to the often used exponential functions @xmath74 which guarantee a fast ultraviolet convergence of the loop integrals .",
    "note that the range ( in momentum space ) of the nonlocality in each channel is determined by the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "fixing the current quark mass and chiral quark condensate at @xmath77 to the phenomenologically adequate values @xmath78 mev and @xmath79 mev , the rest of the parameters can be determined so as to reproduce the physical values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and by requiring @xmath82 , which is within the range of values suggested by recent lattice calculations  @xcite . in what follows this choice of model parameters and form factors",
    "will be referred to as s1 .",
    "the second type of form factor functional forms considered here is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84^{-1 } \\qquad , \\qquad f_{z}(q ) = \\left [ 1 + \\left ( q^{2}/\\lambda_{1}^{2}\\right ) \\right]^{-5/2}. \\label{parametrization_set2}\\ ] ] as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking @xmath85 mev , @xmath86 mev , @xmath87 , @xmath88 mev and @xmath89 mev one can very well reproduce the momentum dependence of mass and wave function renormalization obtained in lattice calculations , as well as the physical values of @xmath81 and @xmath80 . in what follows this choice of model parameters and form factors will be referred to as s2 .",
    "details on the model parameters and the predictions for several meson properties in vacuum can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as stated , we want to study the dependence of nlpnjl model predictions on the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this can be addressed by varying the current quark mass @xmath3 , while keeping the rest of the model parameters fixed at their values at the physical point . as a first step we analyze in this section the corresponding behavior of the pion mass and decay constant at vanishing temperature , in comparison with that obtained in the ( local ) njl model and in lattice qcd .",
    "our results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as it is usual in lattice qcd literature , we choose to take @xmath81 instead of @xmath3 as the independent variable in the plots .",
    "the main reason for this is that @xmath81 is an observable , i.e.  a scale independent quantity , whereas @xmath3 is scale dependent , hence its value is subject to possible ambiguities related to the choice of the renormalization point .",
    "dashed and solid lines correspond to parameter sets s1 and s2 , respectively , while dotted lines correspond to the curves obtained within the njl model .",
    "fat dots stand for lattice qcd results from ref .",
    "the upper panel shows the behavior of the ratio @xmath90 as a function of @xmath81 . in order to account for the above",
    "mentioned renormalization point ambiguities , the corresponding quark masses have been normalized so as to yield the lattice value @xmath91  mev at the physical point  @xcite . from the figure one",
    "observes that both njl and nlpnjl models reproduce qualitatively the results from lattice qcd , showing a particularly good agreement in the case of the nlpnjl model for parameter set s2 .",
    "however , the situation is different in the case of @xmath80 ( lower panel in fig .",
    "1 ) : while the predictions from nonlocal models follow a steady increase with @xmath81 , in agreement with lattice results , the local njl model badly fails to reproduce this behavior .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the discrepancy can not be cured even if one allows the coupling @xmath92 to depend on the current quark mass ( we have taken @xmath92 as a constant in nlpnjl models )  @xcite .",
    "thus , these results can be considered as a further indication in favor of the inclusion of nonlocal interactions as a step towards a more realistic description of low momenta qcd dynamics .",
    "in this section we analyze within our nonlocal models the mass dependence of the critical temperatures for the deconfinement and chiral restoration transitions at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "we start by considering the temperature dependence of the chiral and deconfinement order parameters , as well as the corresponding susceptibilities , for some representative values of the pion mass .",
    "the corresponding results for the lattice motivated parameterization s2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , including both the case of the polynomic ( left panels ) and logarithmic ( right panels ) polyakov potentials . qualitatively similar results are found for the exponential parameterization s1 .",
    "let us first discuss the results for the polynomic potential . from the figure",
    "it is seen that both transitions proceed as smooth crossovers , as expected from lattice qcd results .",
    "moreover , we observe that as @xmath81 increases , the position of the peaks of the susceptibilities @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( left lower panel ) move simultaneously towards higher values of @xmath26 , the difference between the corresponding critical temperatures being in all cases at the level of a few mev .",
    "it is also seen that as @xmath81 increases the chiral restoration transition tends to be less pronounced , while the confinement one becomes steeper . in the case of the logarithmic potential",
    ", we also observe that the transition temperatures increase with @xmath81 , as expected .",
    "however , for a given value of @xmath81 both the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions are steeper than in the case of the polynomic potential , and the correlation between them is stronger ( e.g.  the difference between the transition temperatures for @xmath95 is now about 0.02  mev ) .",
    "in fact , it turns out that already for @xmath96  mev one finds a first order phase transition . from lattice",
    "qcd results the onset of a first order phase transition is indeed expected above a certain critical amount of explicit symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "however , present estimations  @xcite indicate that the corresponding critical pseudoscalar mass should be much larger than the physical pion mass ; therefore , the early change in the character of the transition appears as an unrealistic feature of the logarithmic polyakov potential . in the case of the polynomic potential",
    "the onset of this first order phase transition occurs for a pion mass larger than 700 mev , i.e.  in an energy region where the applicability of the effective quark models is limited .",
    "this situation is qualitatively similar to that observed in the local pnjl model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the results for the mass dependence of the critical transition temperatures within our nonlocal models .",
    "for comparison we also quote typical curves obtained in the framework of the local pnjl model ( here we have considered the parameterization in ref .",
    "upper and lower panels correspond to polynomic and logarithmic polyakov potentials , respectively , with @xmath97  mev . before discussing in detail the results obtained for the nlpnjl models ,",
    "let us comment those corresponding to the pnjl model : from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe that already at the physical value @xmath95 the model predicts a noticeable splitting between the chiral restoration temperature @xmath98 ( dashed line ) and the deconfinement temperature @xmath99 ( dotted line ) . in addition , it is seen that the growth of @xmath98 with @xmath81 is stronger than that of @xmath99 , which implies that the splitting between both critical temperatures becomes larger if @xmath81 is increased .",
    "this is not supported by existing lattice results  @xcite , which indicate that both transitions take place at approximately the same temperature , up to values of @xmath81 even larger than those considered here . comparing both panels",
    "it is seen that the splitting is more pronounced for the pnjl model that includes a logarithmic polyakov potential .",
    "we turn now to the curves obtained within nonlocal models .",
    "first of all , from the figure it is seen that both parameterizations s1 and s2 lead to qualitatively similar results .",
    "contrary to the situation in the pnjl model , in nlpnjl models both the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions occur at basically the same temperature for all considered values of @xmath81 . moreover , comparing the results for the two alternative polyakov loop potentials we see that the main qualitative difference between them is the already mentioned fact that in the case of the logarithmic potential there is a critical pion mass of about 400 mev where the character of the transition changes from crossover to first order ( dashed - dotted and solid lines in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively ) . by analyzing in more detail the pion mass dependence of the critical temperatures",
    ", it is seen that for @xmath81 above the physical mass the nlpnjl model results can be accurately adjusted through a linear function @xmath100 this is in agreement with the findings of the lattice calculations of refs .",
    "our results for the slope parameter @xmath101 for both parameterizations and polyakov loop potentials are in the range of @xmath102 . for comparison ,",
    "most lattice calculations find @xmath103  @xcite , while according to some recent analyses  @xcite the value could be somewhat above this bound .",
    "thus the slope parameter predicted by the nonlocal pnjl models appears to be compatible with lattice estimates .",
    "this can be contrasted with the results obtained within pure chiral models , where one finds a strong increase of the chiral restoration temperature with @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "for example , within the chiral quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite one gets a value @xmath104 .",
    "it is also worth to discuss the effect of considering a value of @xmath55 that depends on the current quark masses , as suggested in ref .",
    "the change in @xmath55 leads to an overall decrease of the transition temperatures , which keep the rising linear dependence on @xmath81 but with a slope parameter that gets reduced by about @xmath105% .",
    "the main noticeable difference is that in all cases the transition becomes steeper , which leads to an earlier onset of the first order transition .",
    "for example , for the parameter set s2 we find that the transition becomes of first order already at @xmath106 mev in the case of the polynomic polyakov potential , and about one half of this value for the logarithmic one .",
    "these critical masses appear to be too small in comparison with present lattice qcd estimations .",
    "however , in this respect it is important to recall the importance of considering corrections that go beyond the mean field approximation used here .",
    "in fact , although the role of these corrections is expected to be less important as the quark mass increases  @xcite , in the range of masses considered here they can be significant enough to soften the transitions and lower the critical temperatures  @xcite . in this sense , although a fully nonperturbative scheme to account for meson fluctuations in nonlocal models is still lacking , some important steps have been taken  @xcite . as it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these fluctuations could also help to avoid thermodynamical instabilities that could arise in nonlocal models .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the dependence of the deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures on the explicit chiral symmetry breaking driven by the current quark mass .",
    "we work in the framework of su(2 ) nonlocal chiral quark models with polyakov loop ( nlpnjl models ) , considering two different functional forms of the polyakov loop effective potential commonly used in the literature , namely a polynomic function and a logarithmic function . as a first step we have considered the mass dependence of the pion mass and decay constant at vanishing temperature , in comparison with that obtained in the local njl model and in lattice qcd .",
    "we have found that , while lattice results for the ratio @xmath90 are in agreement with both local and nonlocal models , those for @xmath80 show a significant increase with @xmath81 that can be reproduced only by the predictions of nonlocal models . concerning the deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures",
    ", we have found that , contrary to the case of the local pnjl model , in nlpnjl models both critical temperatures turn out to be strongly entangled for the considered range of pion masses .",
    "in addition , it is seen that the growth of critical temperatures with the pion mass above the physical point is basically linear , with a slope parameter which is close to existing lattice qcd estimates . on the other hand , particularly in the case of the logarithmic polyakov loop potential",
    ", the present mean field calculation leads to a too early onset of the first order transition known to exist in the large quark mass limit .",
    "we expect that the development of a fully nonperturbative scheme to account for meson fluctuations in nonlocal models might help to provide a solution to this problem .",

    "<S> in the framework of nonlocal su(2 ) chiral quark models with polyakov loop , we analyze the dependence of the deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures on the explicit chiral symmetry breaking driven by the current quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with those obtained within the standard local polyakov@xmath0nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model and with lattice qcd calculations . for a wide range of pion masses , it is found that both deconfinement and chiral restoration critical temperatures turn out to be strongly entangled , in contrast with the corresponding results within the pnjl model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is seen that the growth of the critical temperatures with the pion mass above the physical point is basically linear , with a slope parameter which is close to the existing lattice qcd estimates . on the other hand , within the present mean field calculation </S>",
    "<S> we find an early onset of the first order transition expected in the large quark mass limit . </S>"
