    "even if the supersymmetry parameters are all precisely measured , this is not the whole story , however .",

    "[ sfig : darksusy ] need not coincide with the thermal relic density obtained by following the path from the top .",

    "the uncertainties and problems associated with these issues have been discussed extensively  @xcite . if neutralinos are identified as the dark matter , future colliders will determine their properties and the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross sections . to the extent that these may be checked against actual detection rates , future colliders",

    "the second possible supersymmetric dark matter candidate is the gravitino .",
    "gravitino dark matter is somewhat beyond the scope of this paper ; for an excellent review , see ref .",

    "supersymmetry and the linear collider are a near perfect fit  it is difficult to envision a richer linear collider program than that provided by the superpartner spectrum , and it is hard to imagine a more incisive tool for studying supersymmetry than the linear collider .",
    "of course , the program of supersymmetry studies at the linear collider depends on what superpartners are kinematically accessible .",
    "however , as evident from the many examples discussed above , even if only one or a few superpartners are kinematically accessible , the linear collider will be able to provide model - independent measurements of a host of soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters . in conjunction with the information provided by hadron colliders , this information will likely provide precise information about sparticles beyond the linear collider s reach .    in this overview ,",
    "we have highlighted many of the fundamental questions that will be addressed by such supersymmetry measurements .",
    "these range from issues specific to supersymmetry , such as the testing of supersymmetric identities , the resolution of the supersymmetric flavor and cp puzzles , and the determination of the scale of supersymmetry breaking , to grand universal questions , such as the nature of dark matter , the unification of forces , and the geometry of spacetime .",
    "as discussed in this review , if supersymmetry is within reach , the linear collider may shed light on all of these issues , and will , in some cases , provide definitive answers .    at the same time",
    ", there are many outstanding problems . to name but a few , the study of radiative corrections in supersymmetry and its impact on precision measurements is still in its early days .",
    "in addition , the importance of experimental uncertainties , such as in the luminosity spectrum , beam energy , and polarimetry have been considered in a few studies , but have not been systematically investigated . and of course , new ideas for physics beyond the standard model continually arise , and the potential of linear colliders to probe such new ideas and to differentiate these ideas from other new physics possibilities will continue to be of interest . to fulfill the potential of linear colliders to study new physics , dedicated experimental and theoretical efforts are still needed .",
    "we hope this chapter will be of use to people who are interested in continuing the exploration of supersymmetry at new colliders .",
