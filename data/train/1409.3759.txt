    "non - commutativity in the classical formulation of 4-dimensional general relativity can be implemented in several ways .",
    "the most frequently used is based in the replacement of the ordinary product of functions by the wigner - weyl - groenewold - moyal @xmath0-product  @xcite ( f g)(x ) = e^i2 ^ _ _ f(x ) g(y ) |_y x. in this approach , instead of using non - commutative operators for the coordinates , one uses commutative coordinates variables and a modified point - wise product of functions of them . in most of the models ,",
    "the elements @xmath1 , are taken to vanish and only non - commutativity among spatial coordinates is considered .",
    "although this prescription is easy to implement , theories based on it are sometimes difficult to solve explicitly due to the fact that a general @xmath0-product involves an infinite number of derivatives , being thus non - local .",
    "this feature forces in some situations to resort to a perturbative treatment as perhaps the only way to gain some insight into the problem at hand .",
    "this is properly justified in physical scenarios where the non - commutative parameter is thought to be small , recent bounds on it are of the order of @xmath2 , however it is always interesting to ask what happens if this is not the case , for example on a quantum gravity theory .",
    "we should recall that one of the goals of non - commutativity when used in a classical theory is the regularisation of singularities , namely , classical divergences are expected to be removed by the introduction of a non - commutative structure to which is associated a fundamental length .",
    "the first model where this idea was put into practice is due to snyder  @xcite with his formulation of special relativity aiming to eliminate the infinities appearing in the early stages of quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that a non - commutative structure may violate lorentz invariance if the time coordinate is involved . in order to remedy this situation , a proposal to implement non - commutativity such",
    "that lorentz invariance is maintained has been formulated a few years ago in the context of non - commutative quantum field theory ( ncqft ) by smailagic and spallucci  @xcite using coherent states . among the several interesting results of this approach , it has been noticed that non - commutativity effectively replaces point - like behaviour in classical equations , such as dirac delta functions , by smeared sources described by gaussian functions .",
    "this is in accordance with the point of view that space - time , when equipped with a non - commutative structure , becomes fuzzy and points are not longer localised .",
    "more recently , the above result has been applied to the formulation of non - commutative gravitational models  @xcite . in analogy with ncqft ,",
    "sources of matter and charge are given by gaussian distributions that in the commutative limit reproduce the classical singular behaviour .",
    "with these models , classical issues such as the presence of horizons in black hole solutions have been reexamined .    in the following we will use this strategy to build a deformed einstein - proca system . in his original motivation ,",
    "proca  @xcite aimed for an equation describing particles with positive energy states , having the possibility of both signs of charge and with non - vanishing spin . as it is well - known , proca lagrangian extends naturally electromagnetism to the massive photon case and thus the proca vector field has associated three polarisations states , there are a characteristic length for electromagnetic interaction that depends inversely on the mass of the photon , conservation of charge is preserved and it is relativistic invariant  @xcite .    the use of proca s equations in physics have been diverse and important , for example spin-1 mesons are described by them .",
    "more recently , proca - like lagrangians have been used in the analysis of renormalizability of massive abelian gauge theories , lorentz violation within the photon sector of the standard model and also in the formulation of abelian gauge theories in very special relativity  @xcite .",
    "when considering coupling to gravitational field , the einstein - proca system leads to interesting results on the issue of black holes and their singularities  @xcite and this line of research is what we want to pursue .",
    "the present work is organised as follows : in section  [ secc:2 ] we describe the non - commutative structure of the einstein - proca model we consider . then",
    ", in section  [ secc:3 ] , the deformed field equations of the model are solved .",
    "a class of regular solutions at the origin is then given in section  [ secc:4 ] and the strong non - commutative regime , where more explicit calculations can be done , is discussed .",
    "finally , we end with some general remarks of the results obtained in the conclusions .",
    "the non - commutative einstein - proca model is obtained by considering the field equations g^_= , for the spherically symmetric metric ds^2 = e^(r ) dt^2 - e^(r ) dr^2 - r^2 ( d^2 + ^2 d^2 ) . in this case , the energy - momentum tensors in the field equations have the following structure : first , the non - commutative matter tensor , @xmath3 , is given by ( t_nc)^ _ = diag ( h_1 , h_1 , h_3 , h_3 ) , h_3 : = h_1 + 12 x _ x h_1 , where h_1 : = -_m = - m(4)^3/2 e^-r^2/4 . here",
    "@xmath4 represents a non - commutative diffused distribution of matter which in the commutative limit @xmath5 becomes a point - like source of mass @xmath6 located at the origin .",
    "it can be verified straightforwardly that this form of the energy - momentum tensor satisfies @xmath7 due to the definition of the function @xmath8 in terms of @xmath9 .    for the electromagnetic part , we have  @xcite t^_|_el = 2f_^f _ + a_a_- 12 g _ ( f",
    "_ f^ + a_a^ ) , where @xmath10 is the four - electromagnetic potencial and @xmath11 is the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "this expression comes from the proca - like lagrangian density = ( f _ f^ + a_a^ ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the proca lagrangian corresponds to the choice = - ^2 , where @xmath12 represents the mass of the gauge field .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are determined by the conservation laws 1 _ ( f^ ) - a^= 14 j_nc^ , where now we have a non - commutative four - current @xmath13 in this equation of the form j_nc^= ( g_1 , 0 ) , g_1 : = _ e = q ( 4)^3/2 e^-r^2/4 . here",
    "@xmath14 represents the diffused density charge of the source at the origin which in the commutative limit becomes point - like , in a similar fashion as for the mass density in the non - commutative energy - momentum tensor .      with the above definitions , we now proceed along the same lines as vuille et al  @xcite",
