    "nonclassical features of optical pulses like squeezing , sub - poissonian statistics and entanglement have been of increasing interest for optical communication and measurement techniques @xcite . from classical optics it is well known that in fibers photons can fly in soliton - like pulses over long distances , provided that they intense enough and the fiber nonlinearity can compensate for the dispersion - assisted pulse spreading @xcite . yet solitons are not rigid but very lively nonclassical species , because of the quantum noise associated with the nonlinear dynamics . since already single - mode radiation becomes nonclassical under the influence of a kerr nonlinearity @xcite , solitons can be expected to exhibit not only single - mode nonclassical properties but also nonclassical internal correlations .",
