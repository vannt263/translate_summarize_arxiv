    "this article aims at providing numerical simulations of optimal transport paths studied earlier in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xcite etc .",
    "the theory of optimal transport paths was motivated by studying a phenomenon in optimal transportation where a transport system with a branching structure may be more cost efficient than the one with a `` linear '' structure .",
    "trees , railways , lightning , electric power supply , the circulatory system , the river channel networks , and cardiovascular systems are some common examples .",
    "we used the concept of optimal transport paths between probability measures to model such transport systems in @xcite .",
    "some related works are @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and others .",
    "also , in @xcite , we showed that an optimal transport path is exactly a geodesic in the sense of metric geometry on the metric space of probability measures with a suitable metric .",
    "as a result , people are interested in knowing what an optimal transport path look like numerically .",
    "this is the motivation of this article .",
    "currently , we are using optimal transport paths generated here to model blood vessel structures found in placentas of human babies and also river channel networks .",
    "more application of optimal transport paths is expected in modeling systems simulating what we seen in the nature .",

    "the idea is as follows .",
    "we first consider how to generate an initial transport path , then study how to reduce the cost by modifying the initial transport path as much as possible .",
    "we not only use an algorithm of local minimization but also a global one .",
    "topology of transport paths are not preserved during the modification process .",
    "these algorithms do not necessarily provide us a perfect optimal transport path , but it approximate an optimal transport path very well . using eyes of a human being , the author can not observe a better transport path than the path generated here .",
