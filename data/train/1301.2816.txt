    "in previous papers , an extended theory of electromagnetism was proposed @xcite and developed @xcite .",
    "the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations was studied in @xcite ; nevertheless , the authors assumed that the _ scalar _ perturbations of the electromagnetic field do not affect metric perturbations evolution .",
    "they stated that this assumption holds both in the radiation dominated period and in the matter dominated era , that is to say , at any moment before dark energy domination .",
    "hence , it affects the choice of the initial conditions for numerical integrations , which are always fixed in the radiation dominated era ( @xmath0 ) , when the cosmologically significant scales had superhorizon sizes .",
    "moreover , in paper @xcite , the conservation law of standard electromagnetism , @xmath1 , is assumed , e.g. , to get eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) from eq . ( 2.2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this law is not an equation of extended electromagnetism , whose true conservation law ( see below ) admits solutions with @xmath2 .",
    "this fact is important in cosmology , where the law @xmath1 implies that only vector modes are involved in the expansion of the current @xmath3 , whereas the condition @xmath2 requires the existence of @xmath3 scalar modes .",
    "we have introduced one of these modes ( see below ) in our general calculations .",
    "we see that , in extended electromagnetism , there are scalar modes in the expansions of both the electromagnetic field @xmath4 ( a - modes ) and the current @xmath5 ( j - modes ) . since we have not convincing arguments proving that , initially , at @xmath0 , all these modes are negligible against the small scalar modes of the radiation fluid , we can not ensure that they do not affect metric perturbations . hence , the a and j scalar modes should not be neglected _ a priori _ in order to get the metric and fluid initial conditions for numerical integrations .",
    "after these considerations it seems that the assumption used in @xcite is a simplifying condition which would require further justification ( if it exists ) . in this situation , it is obvious that a more general study of cosmological perturbations is worthwhile .",
    "it is performed in this paper , where a general complete treatment of the cosmological perturbations is developed in the framework of extended electromagnetism .",
    "our approach has various relevant properties : ( i ) it is gauge invariant , ( ii ) it does not involve approximating conditions , ( iii ) it involves a @xmath6 scalar mode as it is required by the general conservation law of extended electromagnetism , and ( iv ) it uses appropriate scalar modes for the field @xmath7 which evolve independently of the scalar gr - modes ( metric and fluid modes ) .",
