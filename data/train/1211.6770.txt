    "core - collapse supernova observations have improved rapidly in quantity and quality over the past decade , and with the coming large synoptic surveys , rates should soon advance by an additional two orders of magnitude or more , with @xmath010@xmath1 events per year likely to be found within @xmath2@xmath30.51 @xcite . with",
    "the new data has come a greater appreciation of the variety of stellar evolutionary phenomena leading to these events .",
    "these include a wide range of possibilities associated with the loss / modification of the envelope .",
    "for very massive stars , these include strong outbursts occurring within a few years prior to the collapse @xcite and circumstellar interactions during the sn @xcite , while premortem enshrouding by dust has been seen in lower - mass stars near the core - collapse threshold @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of binary evolution suggests that mass transfer could play a role prior to a substantial fraction of collapses @xcite .",
    "however , we have not found signatures of impending core collapse that are useful observationally  that would allow us to find and study stars within a designated time before collapse .    a successful core - collapse supernova requires the ejection of the remaining stellar envelope by an outward propagating shock wave that originates deep within the star s core , where it can be boosted initially by neutrino heating of the matter behind the shock front . the radiative precursor  the first radiation to  leak out \" ahead of the shock front , marking the beginning of shock breakout ( sbo ) , a burst of uv / soft x - ray photons  appears when the shock front reaches a point in the star s envelope where the optical depth @xmath4@xmath325@xmath3@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the sbo grows in luminosity , peaking at @xmath4@xmath31 and producing an integrated energy release in radiation of @xmath0@xmath6@xmath7erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sbo contains a great deal of information about the exploding star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , obtaining quality data from such events is exceedingly difficult , since the sbo is the first detectable photon signal to arrive from a sn and has a duration of only seconds to hours ( depending on the progenitor ) , much less than the time that a sn is bright optically .",
    "further , earth s atmosphere is opaque to the sbo spectral peak , and space telescopes can not typically observe more than one nearby galaxy at a time .    to observe a sbo at present",
    "requires either observations of deep fields or a great deal of luck .",
    "observations of distant sne with limited sampling of light curves can be open to interpretation , such as a sn at @xmath2@xmath80.185 detected by galex , for which @xcite claimed that the sbo was seen , while @xcite concluded otherwise .",
    "the detection of a soft x - ray burst preceding sn  2008d , interpreted as a sbo from a dense wolf - rayet wind by @xcite , was due to serendipitous _",
    "swift _ observations of the host galaxy as the star exploded , an exceptional circumstance .",
    "we discuss the possibility of mitigating these difficulties by exploiting the two early signals of core collapse available to observers , neutrinos and gravitational waves @xcite , concentrating on the former .",
    "we discuss two strategies , each with positive and negative attributes .",
    "the first , a galactic sn , would produce an unambiguous signal in neutrino detectors today ( see @xcite ) that could be combined with shock breakout data to constrain properties of the collapsing star , but suffers from an unfavorable event rate of @xmath01 per century .",
    "the second , and our main focus here , is sne within nearby galaxies . a number of studies have confirmed the feasibility of water cherenkov detectors in the @xmath00.51 megaton range , and serious efforts to proceed with such neutrino detectors within a decade have been made around the world @xcite . as these will have a reach of few mpc ( see fig .",
    "[ cumult ] ) , their sn detection rates can exceed one per decade .",
    "a multi - mton instrument would increase this to nearly one event per year .",
    "two techniques to reach a @xmath05  mton mass have been put forward . both employ strategies to provide the overburden required to adequately suppress cosmogenic backgrounds , without excavating a mountain of rock .",
    "the deeptitand concept , addressed in @xcite and @xcite , is based on large tanks of pure water submerged beneath the sea , while the @xcite has discussed a densely - instrumented array in south pole ice within icecube .",
    "detection of both the neutrino burst and the sbo would determine the shock propagation time , placing an important new constraint on progenitor star properties . even if directional information from the neutrinos is insufficient to isolate the source  which would likely be the case  we find that the candidate sn host galaxies would be limited in number , so that targeted campaigns could be launched to discover the uv / x - ray burst from the sbo using conventional methods .",
    "we also discuss searches for below - threshold neutrino counts in the event that non - triggered sbo surveys prove successful , the combination of which would achieve the same end .",
    "the distance range covered by this technique also coincides well with surveys that are imaging prospective sn progenitors .",
    "connecting the sn / sbo event with pre - explosion optical images would further improve our characterization of the star , with important implications for better understanding sn morphologies .",

    "as the sbo timescale is comparable to that of neutrino emission , little early warning would be available , although an optically - thick wind may delay emergence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while observing the sbo spectrum and light curve would provide several pieces useful for a forensic study of the departed star ( see @xcite ) , timing alone would suggest a type and mass .",

    "neutrinos are of particular interest since the data from sn  1987a @xcite provide the general sn neutrino burst properties .",
    "much of the existing literature on this topic is useful ( e.g. , @xcite ) , yet somewhat dated , based on those detectors that were in operation a decade ago . here",
    "we will consider both galactic and extragalactic events in turn .",
    "+      the task of identifying the sbo can be simplified to the extent that data from the neutrino harbinger can be quickly analyzed to pinpoint the angular region likely to contain the sn .",
    "this is essential in the case of a galactic event , as otherwise the scanning must encompass all angles .",
    "there has been some important work preparing the community for rapid sharing and coordinated analysis of data , with the organization of the supernova early warning system ( snews ; @xcite ) being an outstanding example .",
    "we first review the conclusions for a galactic sn , the focus of previous work .",
    "studies have focused on two techniques , exploiting the pointing capabilities of an individual water , heavy water , or liquid argon neutrino detector to locate an event , or coordinating the results from several detectors to determine location by timing and triangulation ( gravitational waves also rely on triangulation and with multiple detectors , possibly including the use of templates , might achieve a localization comparable to neutrinos for a galactic sn , e.g. , @xcite , although our focus shall be on neutrinos ) .",
    "the consensus from past studies has been that the more sensitive technique is pointing @xcite .    in a water detector ,",
    "the limiting factor is the finite angular resolution in reconstructing the neutrino direction via the cherenkov light from the resulting electron / positron . despite the much weaker signal for @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64@xmath65@xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 elastic scattering  typically @xmath01/30th the sn @xmath66@xmath67@xmath68@xmath65@xmath22@xmath67@xmath69 signal , depending on the detector threshold ",

    "@xcite concluded that the localization possible in this case is an angular cone of @xmath05@xmath71 radius .",
    "the collaboration is considering adding gadolinium to the detector to allow for the detection of neutrons , which are currently invisible in super - k @xcite .",
    "if this is done , the pointing capabilities could be improved by vetoing @xmath66 events to isolate the otherwise - indistinguishable @xmath64 scattering .",
    "the future detector hyper - kamiokande @xcite , with a fiducial volume 25 times that of super - k , could localize a galactic event to @xmath01@xmath71 .    in their exploration of the potential of timing and triangulation",

    "their conclusion , that triangulation was a factor of @xmath0100 less effective in limiting @xmath75 , when compared to pointing by elastic scattering , was based on a comparison of the super - kamiokande and sno detectors , and thus was limited by the smaller detector .",
    "it is possible that this is too pessimistic , however , as there may be other , more distinctive time variations in the sn neutrino flux .",
    "recent studies have seen high - frequency ( 10200  hz ) stochastic variations in 2d and 3d simulations of the sn flux  a consequence of convective instabilities and the standing accretion shock instability  and concluded that these variations would currently be detectable in icecube for a sn within @xmath0210 kpc , depending on assumptions , despite a very limiting signal / noise ratio in that detector of @xmath01/10 @xcite .",
    "the sn neutrino event rate in hyper - kamiokande during the first several seconds of the burst should be @xmath050/ms , about 1/3 the rate in icecube , but with negligible background .",
    "thus , once more than one detector of this class is operational , it is possible that timing via detailed pattern matching would greatly increase the power of this technique .",
    "while future neutrino advances will localize a galactic sn to within a degree , it will not solve the problem that motivates this study , the @xmath0hundred - year wait between events .",
    "further , whenever the next galactic sn does occur , it will still only represent one class of the great variety of sne .",
    "unfortunately , neither of the techniques described above can be applied successfully to the extragalactic sne of interest here , as both depend fundamentally on large statistics .",
    "the prospect of detecting a sn core collapse from far beyond the galaxy long appeared to be impractical .",
    "however , in @xcite it was recognized that a 1  mton detector would expect @xmath01 @xmath66@xmath67@xmath68@xmath65@xmath22@xmath67@xmath69 event from out to a few mpc , which could be searched for after an optical discovery .",
    "a sn in andromeda , which is also an infrequent source of sne , would produce @xmath040 events in hyper - kamiokande . if we set as our goal reaching starburst galaxies such as m82 and ic342 , where sne are far more frequent",
    ", then the best we can hope to achieve is a signal distinguishable from background .",
    "as these starburst galaxies are at distances of over 3 mpc , each core collapse would produce @xmath010 counts / event in a 5  mton detector and @xmath023 in hyper - kamiokande .",
    "we emphasize that , for the purpose of triggering , an independent detection of the core collapse is essential .",
    "following the methods in @xcite , we address the prospects for detecting `` mini - bursts '' of core - collapse neutrino events . for a 5  mton detector ,",
    "background rates dictate that @xmath763 sn @xmath66 events are required to reduce false triggers . in a 560  kton detector , such as hyper - kamiokande ,",

    "a more significant difference could arise if collapse proceeds to a black hole without a robust explosion . in this case",
    ", the flux from the short - lived proto - neutron star should be larger with a harder spectrum ( @xcite ; see , e.g. , figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "while we have assumed this population to not be substantial , the fraction of core collapses that end this way is not well constrained , with a current limit of @xmath5650% @xcite .",
    "if this fraction is in the tens of percent range , it would start to affect the strategy of neutrino searches , since these events could be detectable from greater distances .",
    "this itself would be quite a significant discovery . in this case their presence should be first noticed via their imprint on the spectrum of the cosmic mev neutrino background , as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , or possibly a new class of optical transients that we discuss later , so that the true rate can be estimated independently .",
    "we believe that the analysis presented here could be further refined , to take into account additional information from the detected neutrino events : for example , as progenitors that release more energy in @xmath66 tend to produce harder spectra , an improved distance indicator could be designed that incorporates information on @xmath89 .",

    "[ shockprop ] .",
    "observations of the sn progenitor by surveys of supergiants in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) would imply a stellar mass , although models are needed to interpret such data .",
    "thus , the direct determinations of stellar properties afforded by sbo measurements will be valuable .",
    "this is particularly true for cases where progenitor information is ambiguous due to a nearby cluster or binary companion .",
    "one can even imagine taking images during the period between the neutrino warning and the sbo to compare with earlier epochs .",
    "the primary objective discussed here is based on measuring the times of both core collapse and shock emergence .",
    "if surveys are conducted to observe sbo events without a trigger , it is worth considering what neutrino signals would be useful if detection is not independently possible , i.e. , looking after the fact for fewer counts than the two for hyper - kamiokande or three for 5  mton used above . for a hyper - k size detector , @xcite determined that searching for even single events from the period preceding a sn could be feasible , depending upon the expected background in the time window that must be considered . comparing to fig .",
    "[ shockprop ] , for sn  ibc or bsg events , this would be rather short if the sbo is detected and , since the neutrino burst is much briefer , one neutrino event would be sufficient to time the shock passage . for rsg , comparing the propagation time differences in fig .",
    "[ shockprop ] between adjacent progenitor masses , even while keeping energy injection fixed , the cc ",
    "sbo delay is most likely @xmath0days .",
    "one might try to further model the sbo and attempt to deduce the core collapse timing , although this is what one would like to test .",
    "using the rate given in @xcite , in a 5  mton detector the single event background is @xmath02",
    "hour@xmath101 , complicating the interpretation of a lone detected event for even bsg progenitors .",
    "however , the rate of random double coincidences ( within 10  sec ) is @xmath00.2  day@xmath101 , which , while being too high to allow independent triggers , could be low enough for searches of data taken prior to even rsg sbo events . using the same core - collapse rate estimators as before",
    ", this would add @xmath024 events per decade .",
    "this assumes the detector discussed in @xcite . a multi - megaton detector that utilizes similar detection principles as icecube , but with much denser instrumentation to reach a @xmath010  mev threshold and situated deep within icecube to use the outer detector as a muon veto , has also been put forward @xcite .",
    "a study of potential designs indicates an effective detector mass upwards of @xmath07.5  mton could be reached if photomultiplier tube noise can be sufficiently reduced @xcite , the feasibility of which is being investigated @xcite .",
    "the count thresholds for this technique will need to be determined for each design , but aim to achieve detection rates comparable to those presented above .",
    "the possibility of unifying a variety of observational techniques to study the complete chain of events following a core collapse is a difficult , yet compelling , challenge .",
    "neutrino and gravitational wave telescopes monitoring the cores of massive stars for signs of collapse can supply advanced notice that a shock should have just formed and is on its way to the star s surface .",
    "neutrinos are promising because ( 1 ) from sn  1987a , we understand what to look for and ( 2 ) neutrino telescopes can be scaled to continuously cover out to several mpc .",
    "this will allow concerted searches for the shock breakout , which , despite being thought to be ubiquitous in core - collapse supernovae , perhaps even for those forming black holes often considered as failures , is one of the rarest observed astronomical events due its transient nature and otherwise unpredictable appearance .",
    "we can extract physics from the sbo only if we identify the photons from the collapsed star before they pass us by . for a galactic sn ,",
    "super - kamiokande @xcite and icecube @xcite can presently alert us to the event , and the pointing capabilities of super - kamiokande will limit the sbo search to a cone of @xmath117 .",
    "we thus have a fighting chance of detecting the sbo , though the wait to the next sn may be a long one .",
    "because galactic sne only occur perhaps once per human lifetime , it would be tragic if such an event were to occur while we were not fully prepared to conduct the optimal sbo search .",
    "we will discuss such galactic searches in more detail elsewhere , considering cases where the sn may be either heavily extincted or exceptionally bright , requiring / allowing novel observational techniques .",
    "the most likely next step in distant sn searches , a hyper - kamiokande - class neutrino telescope , could provide @xmath012 warnings per decade , giving us an order of magnitude more opportunities to identify the sbo .",
    "it is quite possible that several detectors of this class could be constructed in asia , europe , and the u.s .  within the next @xmath0ten years , opening up opportunities through collaborations like snews to coordinate observations and combine data sets .",
    "we have seen , as exhibited in table  [ tab : params ] , that a limited number of galaxies are of the greatest interest in this endeavor .",
    "we thus emphasize the importance of understanding the star formation rates and distances of galaxies such as ngc 253 and ic  342 as well as possible .",
    "measuring both the neutrino ( or gw ) burst and the sbo is the only way to time the shock s passage through the mantle .",
    "we have described how this observable and three other sbo properties are related to progenitor and explosion parameters in simple polytropes . were an sbo observed , these connections would , of course , be made in the context of the best available sn and progenitor models .",
    "interest in short time domain astronomy has spread rapidly ( e.g. , @xcite ) and early time sn data has led to a recent revival in theoretical shock breakout interest ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the interim leading to large neutrino telescope operations , novel observational programs will hopefully break new empirical ground ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while computational advances should allow for multi - dimensional simulations of sn progenitors that include the frenetic last few years of evolution @xcite , during which changes in the envelope can be rapid and significant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the protocols for acting on the triggers provided by large neutrino detectors should be carefully developed before the next event .",
    "as new steps in technology are taken , such as hyper - kamiokande , the development of such protocols should be viewed as an element of the construction plan  one of the items that should be ready when the detector first turns on .",
    "the same principles can be applied to gravitational waves if advanced detectors are built to sufficient sensitivity to see extragalactic sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the development of modern gamma - ray burst searches with _ swift _ provides a model for how this can be done and illustrates how a field can be transformed with rapid follow - up observations .",
    "the identification of sbo events will likely prove to be a powerful tool for determining properties of the progenitors and thus correlating progenitor properties with other observables , optical , neutrino , and gravitational .",
    "this progenitor specificity will establish a tighter connection between observation and modeling , providing a better test of our understanding of the supernova mechanism .",
