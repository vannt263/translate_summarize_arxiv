    "various approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory @xcite , noncommutative geometry @xcite , and loop quantum gravity @xcite motivate the existence of a minimal measurable length .",
    "these theories argue that near the planck scale , the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) should be replaced by the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the effects of gravity play an important role in the limit of small distances around the planck length , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is newton s constant , @xmath3 is the planck constant , and @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    "equivalently , these effects are dominant in the limit of high energies near the planck energy @xmath5 .    in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , a particle with an arbitrary energy can be accurately localized and its exact location can be obtained . according to the quantum filed theory and based on heisenberg uncertainty principle , only particles with infinite energy can be localized . however , in quantum gravity theories that try to combine the effects of gravity with quantum mechanics , the localization of particles completely disappear . in general relativity , it is possible to access the path of particles that is impossible to obtain in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , in quantum mechanics determination of exact position of particles requires infinite momentum uncertainty .",
    "now , in order to achieve the ultimate theory of quantum gravity , one of the results of combination of gravity and quantum mechanics is introducing the minimal measurable length of the order of the planck length . in this case , particles lose their point - like description .",
    "thus , to find the position of particles , a minimal length uncertainty proportional to the planck length should be taken into account and the sharp localization condition for particles is relaxed @xcite .",
    "moreover , some gedanken experiments in black - hole physics and noncommutativity of the spacetime manifold predict the existence of a minimal observable distance of the order of the planck length @xcite .",
    "the generalization of ordinary uncertainty relation by incorporating quantum gravity effects requires a modification of the hamiltonian of various physical systems which has been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "according to recent statistical approaches , standard thermodynamics seems to be not suitable for studying all systems including the behavior of complex systems which are governed by the nonextensive statistics @xcite .",
    "a nonextensive statistical mechanics which is proposed by tsallis @xcite and inspired by the probabilistic description of multifractal geometries , generalizes all thermodynamical quantities such as the partition function and the internal energy with the entropic index @xmath6 that plays an important role in this framework .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath7 it gives the well - known boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
    "notice that the nonextensive statistics could be more useful than the traditional boltzmann - gibbs statistics in many situations .",
    "the theory behind the boltzmann - gibbs entropy implies a strong dependence on initial conditions .",
    "however , most materials behave quite independently of the initial conditions . in other words ,",
    "the usage of the well - known bg statistical mechanics occasionally fails and leads to serious difficulties . in this",
    "regards , we can mention long - range interactions , e.g. , @xmath8 gravitation @xcite , long - range microscopic memory , e.g. , nonmarkovian stochastic processes @xcite , and conservative or dissipative systems multifractal - like structures @xcite .",
    "more examples include granular systems @xcite , levy anomalous diffusion @xcite , pure - electron plasma two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , phonon - electron anomalous thermalization in ion - bombarded solids @xcite , solar neutrinos @xcite , peculiar velocities of galaxies @xcite , and inverse bremsstrahlung in plasma @xcite and black - holes @xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "tsallis statistics has attracted much attention in the literature @xcite . among these investigations",
    ", we can mention the harmonic oscillator in both classical and quantum domains @xcite , the phase space of tsallis entropy for the harmonic oscillator @xcite , the quantum entanglement of maximum tsallis entropy state @xcite , path integral approach to the nonextensive canonical density matrix @xcite , the hydrogen atom in three dimensions @xcite , and the sensitivity of the population state to the value of @xmath6 for a two - state system @xcite .",
    "moreover , tsallis entropy is compared to two different entropies , namely , renyi entropy @xmath9 , and the normalized tsallis entropy , @xmath10 , which is shown that the tsallis entropy is more stable @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors have investigated the exact vibrational partition function for quantum nonextensive harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "they showed that for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 the inequality @xmath13 holds and @xmath14 increases as @xmath6 and @xmath11 grow up where @xmath15 and @xmath11 represent the partition function and temperature , respectively .",
    "here and throughout the paper the symbol @xmath16 denotes the quantities obtained in the extensive statistics , i.e. , boltzmann - gibbs thermodynamics .",
    "nowadays , it is believed that the minimal length scale naturally appears in various areas of high energy physics @xcite . in particular , the effects of minimal length scale on thermodynamics of various physical systems have been studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at this point",
    ", it is worth explaining why the idea of minimal length scale can be incorporated in thermodynamics .",
    "consider a system which can not be probed to distances smaller than some length scale .",
    "this phenomenon can be an intrinsic property of the system such as the minimal length scale in high energy physics which is of the order of the planck length @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it can be due to the size effect of the measurement apparatus .",
    "for instance , in finance as a complex system , the existence of a minimal length scale is necessary due to the fact that the stock price is indeed a discrete variable @xcite . in thermodynamics ,",
    "the gas particles have a nonzero size of the order of the atom s radius .",
    "so , these particles can not probe distances smaller than their finite size which is indeed the minimal length scale of the system . here , we use a framework that is compatible with this minimal length scale .    in this paper , we study the thermodynamics of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the presence of a minimal length and in the nonextensive tsallis statistics . although , other forms of gup which imply both minimal measurable length and maximal momentum could be considered @xcite , to obtain exact solutions we only consider the existence of a minimal length .",
    "notice that at ordinary distances the effects of gravity are not dominant and the ordinary physical laws can be used without difficulty . however , at small distances of the order of planck length , the effects of gravity are considerable and the modification of physical laws would be required .",
    "the usage of the tsallis statistics is based on the fact that physical systems with long - range interactions , long - time memories , and multifractal structures can hardly be treated within the traditional bg statistical framework .",
    "therefore , the application of nonextensive statistical models is unavoidable for these systems .    the aim of our investigation is to analyze the behavior of a nonextensive thermodynamical system in the framework of the quantum gravity .",
    "also , the modification of the thermodynamical variables in the presence of the minimal length uncertainty is addressed .",
    "the nonextensive statistical model contains the effect of multifractal geometry and therefore the concept of discrete geometric constructions can be essentially derived from multifractal geometry .",
    "however , the probabilities in nonextensive models depend on the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "in fact , the statistical model does not obtain the energy spectrum , it only use them to construct the partition function .",
    "so , when an statistical model agrees with the concept of discrete geometric constructions , the energy spectrum should be also obtained from a framework which agrees with this concept . in other words , a consistent way to find the nonextensive partition function is to use the gup - corrected energy spectrum as the input of the nonextensive model which both imply the discrete geometry .    here",
    ", the vibrational partition function , probability function , internal energy , and the specific heat capacity are obtained for @xmath0 .",
    "we also compare our results with the corresponding quantities in the absence of minimal length @xcite and with the boltzmann - gibbs thermodynamics .",
    "note that the black - body radiation in tsallis statistics and in the presence of the minimal length can also be treated using this model .",
    "in ordinary quantum mechanics , heisenberg uncertainty principle allows us to measure the position and momentum of a particle separately with an arbitrary precision .",
    "but in the presence of a minimal value for the position measurement , the heisenberg uncertainty relation should be modified .",
    "one way to incorporate the minimal length is to generalize the heisenberg uncertainty principle as follows @xcite @xmath17\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the deformation parameter and defined as @xmath19 which @xmath20 is the planck mass and @xmath21 is of the order of unity . to show this , note that the absolute minimal measurable length is obtained by saturating the above inequality .",
    "so , we find @xmath22 and the absolute minimal measurable length is given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "in the context of string theory this length can be interpreted as the length of the string and therefore the string s length is proportional to the square root of the gup parameter . in thermodynamics , this minimal length is given by the size of the atoms where distances smaller than @xmath25 can not be probed by the particles .",
    "notice that , since we have @xmath26 , the minimal length scale is not essentially equal to the planck length , but it is of the order of the planck length .",
    "so , @xmath25 could be smaller or bigger than the planck length upon choosing @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the exact value for @xmath29 is hoped to be obtained in the future experiments . in one dimension , the generalized uncertainty relation leads to the following deformed commutation relation @xmath30=i\\hbar\\left(1+\\beta p^{2}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be written in terms of ordinary position and momentum operators as @xmath33 where @xmath34=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "moreover , all hamiltonians will be modified due to the deformed commutation relation . in this _ formally _ self - adjoint representation , the hamiltonian @xmath35 can be expressed as @xmath36    here , we study the thermodynamics of the quantum harmonic oscillator which its hamiltonian is given by @xmath37 .",
    "so , using the representation ( [ 99 ] ) , the generalized schrdinger equation in momentum space reads @xmath38 using the new variable @xmath39 , the above equation can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the thermodynamics of quantum harmonic oscillator in the presence of a minimal length uncertainty and in the tsallis framework . the notion of a nonzero minimal length scale",
    "is motivated by various phenomena in high energy physics such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , and black - hole physics .",
    "in fact , in the limit of high energies near the planck energy or equivalently in the limit of small distances near the planck length , the effects of gravity become dominant which modifies the physical laws . on the other hand the importance of the tsallis statistics as",
    "a nonextensive statistical model is due to the fact that the extensive bg statistics has a strong dependence on the initial conditions which is not hold for the most materials .",

    "is expected .",
    "we also studied the behavior of the probability function in the presence of a minimal length scale for two different temperatures and found that for the nonextensive statistics , the probability of finding the system at the ground state is not equal to unity even at the zero temperature . finally , in the limit of @xmath7 , the corresponding boltzmann - gibbs results in the presence of the minimal length uncertainty is recovered .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the thermodynamics of quantum harmonic oscillator in the tsallis framework and in the presence of a minimal length uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the minimal length is motivated by various theories such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , and black - hole physics . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically obtain the partition function , probability function , internal energy , and the specific heat capacity of the vibrational quantum system for @xmath0 and compare the results with those of tsallis and boltzmann - gibbs statistics without the minimal length scale . </S>"
