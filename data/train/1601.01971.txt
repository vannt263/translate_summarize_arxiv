    "absorption of the background radio continuum by neutral hydrogen ( ) traces the cool component of the neutral gas in galaxies , the reservoir for star formation .",
    "high redshift observations of the 21-cm transition can address several pressing problems in cosmology and fundamental physics , such as the evolution of large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) , detecting the epoch of re - ionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) and measuring the contribution of the neutral gas content to the mass density of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , spectral lines at high redshift can provide a measure of the values of the fundamental constants of nature at large look - back times ( see @xcite ) . of these ,",
    "the hydroxyl radical ( oh ) is of particular interest since several different combinations of the constants can be measured from this single species @xcite .",
    "that is , oh can potentially yield several measurements from a single sight - line , thus eliminating any relative velocity offsets which would cause a change in the redshifts , thus imitating a variation in the constants .    however , the detection of high redshift  absorption is currently very elusive , with only three detections at @xmath0 ( look - back times of @xmath1 gyr ) , two of which occur in galaxies intervening the sight - lines to more distant quasars @xcite and one within the host galaxy of the quasar itself @xcite .",
    "the former `` intervening '' systems arise in damped lyman-@xmath2 absorption systems ( dlas ) ) , detected through the lyman- transition ( usually redshifted into the optical band at @xmath3 . ] , with the low detection rate at high redshift being due to the geometry of an expanding universe , where the high redshift cases can not occult the background emission as effectively as those at lower redshift @xcite . in the case of molecular absorption ,",
    "the optical selection of targets means that the background quasi - stellar object ( qso ) is not sufficiently obscured by the dla @xcite to indicate a suitable environment for detecting molecular gas in absorption , either by oh @xcite or by molecules with transitions in the millimetre band ( e.g. co , hco@xmath4 , hcn , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , given that an optical redshift biases against a dusty , obscured object , in the millimetre and decimetre bands , the number of redshifted molecular absorption systems remains a paltry five , all of which are at a redshifts of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) . for the `` associated '' systems , the use of an optical redshift to which to tune the receiver also introduces a bias against the detection of neutral atomic and molecular gas , particularly at high redshift . from a survey for  21-cm and millimetre - band",
    "( co , hco@xmath4 & hcn ) absorption at @xmath0 , @xcite obtained zero detections in the ten objects searched . upon a detailed analysis of the photometry",
    ", they found all of the radio sources to be above a @xmath6    luminosity of @xmath7 , where 21-cm has _ never _ been detected , no matter the selection criteria or redshift @xcite .",
    "this critical value applies at all redshifts @xcite and , while 21-cm absorption is readily detected at @xmath8 ( e.g. @xcite ) , above these redshifts the optical selection of targets biases towards objects which are most uv luminous in the quasar rest - frame . in these ,",
    "the  ionising ( @xmath9   ) photon rate of @xmath10  sec@xmath11 is sufficient to ionise _ all _ of the neutral atomic gas in a large spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "this suggests that even the square kilometre array will not detect atomic or molecular absorption in the @xmath0 radio galaxies and quasars currently known ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in order to find such absorption at high redshift , it is necessary to dispense with the traditional reliance upon optical redshifts and perform spectral scans towards optically faint radio sources .",
    "currently , however , sufficiently wide spectral scans are subject to severe radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . therefore , in order to avoid the optical selection of targets , while retaining relatively narrow bandwidths , we can tune the receiver to the redshift of co emission , which has been detected over 150 times at @xmath12 . here",
    "we present the results of the first survey for  and oh absorption in a sample of @xmath0 co emitters .",
    "from the known @xmath12 co emitterscompiled from @xcite . ]",
    "we selected those for which the 21-cm transition is redshifted into the 90-cm bands of the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , we compiled the photometry and selected those with an appreciable radio flux ( estimated to exceed @xmath13 jy at the redshifted 21-cm frequency ) , prioritised by lowest @xmath14    luminosity ( fig . [ seds_full ] ) .",
    "this yielded a shortlist of seven sources , of which six could be observed with the gbt and five with the gmrt . in order to offer some redundancy against rfi , we targeted the four sources which could be observed by both telescopes .",
    "although we attempted to select the most optically faint sources , the high redshift ( @xmath0 ) selection did nevertheless lead to the seven shortlisted sources having @xmath14    luminosities above ( but close to ) the critical value of @xmath15  ( see table  [ obs ] ) .",
    "each of the sources was searched for  21-cm absorption on 3031 august 2013 with the gmrt full 30 antenna array , using the 325 mhz receiver backed with the fx correlator over a bandwidth of 4 mhz .",

    "many of the observational scans were marred by rfi and those completely dominated by interference were removed .",
    "nevertheless , there remained rfi spikes peppered throughout the band .",
    "given that the gbt is a single dish telescope , thus not giving the option of removing badly affected baseline pairs , there was little we could do to improve the data , although we did apply the following steps :    1 .",
    "we fitted and removed a low order polynomial to the bandpass , although some ripple was still apparent in some spectra ( e.g. 0748 + 274 , fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "we did not use high order polynomials in order to avoid over - fitting the data and thus possibly removing any putative broad , weak absorption features .",

    "[ n - z ] , we see that our survey is as sensitive as many of the previous surveys for redshifted associated  21-cm absorption and deep enough to re - detect the majority of the known 21-cm absorbers.compiled from @xcite with the non - detections compiled in @xcite . ]",

    "we now discuss possible reasons why co emission is readily detected at ionising photon rates which are inhospitable to the neutral atomic gas .",
    "interstellar molecules form on dust grains and so shielding by dust may be a reason why co is detected at ultra - violet luminosities which ionise the . however",
    ", the fact that the uv / visible fluxes are high may suggest that the sight - lines towards the sources have relatively low dust obscuration .    in order to address this , in fig .",
    "[ v - k ] we show the optical  near infrared colours of the co emitters as a proxy for dust obscuration . from these",
    ", we see that the colours span a very similar range to optically selected qsos ( @xcite , which have a mean and a standard deviation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) in comparison to @xmath40 for the five known redshifted molecular absorption systems ( see figure  1 of @xcite ) and @xmath41 for associated 21-cm absorption @xcite .",
    "the molecular absorption is due to low - excitation gas ( @xmath42 k , @xcite ) , where the density is insufficient to populate the higher levels of the molecules , according to the higher kinetic temperatures ( i.e. @xmath43 ) . for gas in emission , however , both the volumic density excitation temperature must be higher , although lower than the kinetic temperature ( @xmath44  k , cf . @xmath45  k , @xcite ) , indicating that the gas is , on average , at intermediate densities and perhaps less obscured by dust , as is indicated by the less reddened colours .    however , the colours may not be a reliable indicator of the actual column densities , if the dense regions are embedded in a diffuse medium .",
    "very dense self - shielded clumps of high column density gas could give rise to substantial co emission with un - reddened colours , if the surface filling factor of the dense gas is low .",
    "these low filling factors ( @xmath46% in absorption , @xcite ) offer an alternate explanation to the lack of 21-cm absorption .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ n - z ] , 21-cm absorption is readily detected at @xmath8 and is also detected in all five of the decimetre / millimetre band molecular absorbers @xcite and so low filling factors are unlikely to be the cause of the 21-cm non - detections .",
    "another viable reason for the detection of co at uv luminosities unfavourable to 21-cm absorption is the possibility that the molecular gas is self - shielded , due to its higher density .",
    "@xcite showed that an ionising photon rate of @xmath35  sec@xmath11 was sufficient to ionise all of the neutral gas in a galaxy with the  distribution of the milky way @xcite .",
    "this critical value is therefore valid for a central gas density of @xmath47  @xmath48 , which decays with galactocentric radius with a scale - length of @xmath49  kpc .",
    "however , co traces gas of significantly higher density , and applying the canonical @xmath50  @xmath48 to the maximum luminosity at which co is detected , @xmath36 , gives a scale - length of @xmath51 pc and a total gas mass of @xmath52 , both values being typical of a spiral galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , while an exponential disk may reasonably model the large - scale neutral atomic gas distribution in a galaxy , the denser molecular gas is expected to be embedded in discrete clouds within this .",
    "this could mean that the molecular gas is shielded by the enveloping atomic gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , since the dissociation of  requires higher energy photons than the ionisation of  ( 14.7 cf .",
    "13.6 ev , @xcite ) . because of its large dipole moment , it is co , not  directly , which is detected in these millimetre band surveys and so it is possible that co emission at high redshift could arise in very different environments than in the galaxy , and use of the galactic conversion ratio @xcite would not be warranted . therefore , since we have no direct measure of the  emission properties of these objects , it is more prudent to consider the co directly .",
    "this is dissociated at 11.09 ev ( e.g. @xcite ) , which would suggest that the co actually shields the , and being readily detected , while  is not , this would indicate that the co may be more remote from the agn activity , a possibility which we now discuss .",
    "co emission in high redshift galaxies has been observed to extend to large scales ; @xmath53 kpc in the @xmath54 transition @xcite and @xmath55 kpc in the @xmath56 transition .",
    "this extended emission appears to arise from external components such as merging gas - rich galaxies @xcite and ly  halos around the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the co emission is often aligned with the radio jet axis @xcite , which is a further indication that the co is not confined to the host radio galaxy .    since the  absorption is believed to arise in the disk , if not the obscuring nuclear material @xcite , the molecular gas detected in emission may therefore be spatially offset from the atomic detected in absorption .",
    "if this were the case , we may expect differences in the offsets of each species from the systemic redshift . calculating these via",
    "@xmath57 gives mean offsets of @xmath58  for the co emission and @xmath59 for the  absorption ( fig .",
    "[ dv - hist ] ) .    that is , on average , the  absorption may be more offset from the systemic velocity , where we would expect this to be less , if the  were intrinsic .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test of the @xmath60 values gives a probability of @xmath61 that the two samples are drawn from the same population , which is significant at @xmath62 assuming gaussian statistics ( fig .",
    "[ co - uv ] ) .",
    "this overall blueshift of the cool neutral gas was also noted by @xcite , whose sample comprises 19 of the 43  absorbers for which we can estimate @xmath60 .",
    "the blueshift was attributed to outflowing gas ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and fast outflows could account for the offsets of @xmath63 , which exceed the escape velocity of a large spiral galaxy .",
    "fast outflowing gas is predominant in compact radio sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , which may have higher  detection rates than in the extended sources ( e.g. @xcite ) . since such kinetic feedback can deplete the hydrogen in galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , the depletion of gas in more mature ( extended ) objects could explain the paucity of 21-cm absorption detections , although high resolution radio imaging of the co emitters would be required in order to verify this .",
    "note , however , that once the @xmath15  sources are removed from the radio source samples , the  detection rates in compact objects does not differ significantly from those in non - compact objects , which is consistent with the compact objects being less mature and luminous than the non - compact sources @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that photo - ionisation of the neutral gas remains a key factor in the non - detection of .    furthermore , in drawing any conclusions from the velocity offsets , it should be noted that many of the optical redshifts are only accurate to the second decimal place giving uncertainties of @xmath64  and so the absolute value of @xmath60 may be unreliable , with many of the @xmath65 values arising by default ( see fig .",
    "[ q_dis ] ) . the narrower spread in  offsets - value of @xmath66 ) . ] may suggest that the atomic gas is more likely to be associated with the radio source , although one can not draw any firm conclusions from the distribution of the offsets until more accurate optical redshifts become available .",
    "returning to the dissociation of co by the uv flux , in fig .",
    "[ q_dis ] we show the co photo - dissociation rate versus @xmath60 , from which we only see a weak correlation .    assuming that this is diluted by inaccurate optical redshifts and projection effects , and provided that @xmath60 is a reliable proxy for the distance between the agn host , this may be evidence of the molecular clouds being able to survive larger rates ( @xmath67  sec@xmath11 ) due to their larger distances from the agn .",
    "another possibility for the detection of co emission in the brightest uv sources , is that both luminosities are correlated with star forming activity : due to the low efficiency of star - formation , the consumption of molecular gas is far from complete , with a depletion times of @xmath68  gyr at @xmath69 @xcite compared to 0.7 gyr at @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "that is , there is an apparent increase in star formation efficiency with redshift .",
    "investigating the origin of the uv luminosity , in fig .",
    "[ co - uv ] we show the co line luminosity versus the uv continuum luminosity , from which a non - parametric generalised kendall - tau test gives a @xmath71 probability of the observed correlation occuring by chance , which is significant at @xmath72 .",
    "such a relationship may be expected , since far - infrared emission is a tracer of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , where @xmath73 , e.g. @xcite ) and six of our sample are estimated to have @xmath74  ( fig .",
    "[ seds_full ] ) .",
    "the fact that they have both high co and fir luminosities , suggests that they are host to high star formation rates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is generally assumed that all of the fir emission arises from star formation and such a large dynamic range may be subject to selection effects , such as an increasing luminosity with redshift probing differing host morphologies and amplification of the flux by gravitational lensing .    in fig .",
    "[ radio - uv ] , we also find a strong correlation between the radio and uv continuum luminosities ( @xmath75 for the 27 sources for which the radio luminosity can be obtained ) . since the radio  fir correlation is often attributed to star - formation , this could strengthen the argument that the high uv luminosities arise from star formation , although the radio  fir relationship is generally limited to @xmath76  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath77 , the population rapidly becomes dominated by agn ( e.g. @xcite ) , although this is only measured to @xmath78 and it is not known how this extrapolates to high redshift .    in fig .",
    "[ mpd ] we show the estimated star formation rates , based upon the uv ( @xmath79  ) luminosities @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath80  at which 21-cm is detected corresponds to a sfr of @xmath81 , with the maximum @xmath82  at which co is detected corresponding to 17000 . by assuming that all of the fir emission is due to star formation , rates of @xmath83  have been found in high redshift ( @xmath84 ) co emitters ( e.g. @xcite ) , although these rates are believed to occur in short bursts ( @xmath85 myr ) .",
    "thus , we obtain extremely high star formation rates based upon the uv luminosities of the co emitters and hence believe that , at least partially , the high luminosities , and subsequent dust heating , are caused by increased agn activity ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    one way to address the origin of the uv radiation would be through spectral classification , although , of the six of the seven target spectra which could be found , all are uv ( rest ) emission line spectra , with little continuum , and so are difficult to classify .",
    "however , ned classifies three as qsos ( 0748 + 27 , 1359 + 154 & 2327 + 39 ) and four as galaxies ( 0119 + 130 , 0508 + 604 , 0647 + 415 & 1909 + 722 ) , although the 50% detection rate in both type-1 and type-2 objects @xcite suggests that the host morphology makes little difference to the detection of 21-cm absorption in objects below the critical uv luminosity .",
    "we have undertaken a survey for atomic (  21-cm ) and molecular ( oh 18-cm ) absorption in seven strong co emitters at @xmath0 . our motivation was to circumvent the need for an optical redshift , to which to tune the receiver , which selects against the detection of decimetre absorption at high redshift .",
    "tuning to the co redshift also has the advantage that large amounts ( @xmath86 ) of molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ) are known to exist and  absorption and co emission are often coincident in low - z active galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . despite this",
    ", no absorption of either species was detected .",
    "we attribute this as being due to the targets , despite careful selection , having rest - frame ultra - violet luminosities close to the value above which all of the neutral gas is ionised @xcite .    while the non - detection of  21-cm absorption within the host galaxies of sources with ionising photon rates exceeding @xmath87  sec@xmath11 ( @xmath88 ) appears to be a universal phenomenon , holding true for various heterogeneous and unbiased samples , with varying selection criteria and over all redshifts",
    ", we find that co emission is readily detected at @xmath89 . in order to explain the detection of molecular gas in emission ,",
    "while atomic gas in absorption remains undetected , we suggest the following , non - mutually exclusive , possibilities :    1 .",
    "that , due to the ionisation of  occuring at a lower energy than the dissociation of , as per galactic clouds , the molecular gas is shielded by the atomic gas . however , by the same argument the co should shield the , although this is likely to be embedded in dense molecular cores which are enveloped by the more diffuse atomic gas .",
    "2 .   co traces higher density gas ( @xmath90  , cf .",
    "@xmath91  @xmath48 for ) , which could provide the co with better self - shielding against the uv flux . from our model galaxy @xcite , we find that the maximum luminosity at which co is detected ( @xmath36 ) gives a gas density distribution and mass which is consistent with the molecular gas in a typical spiral galaxy .",
    "this , however , relies on the assumption that the distribution of co is spatially coincident with the , when the molecular gas is likely to be embedded in discrete clumps .",
    "the co gas is located in a dustier environment which provides better shielding against photo - ionisation .",
    "this appears to be the case for both molecular and  21-cm _ absorption _ which are correlated with the optical  near infrared colours of the sight - line . for the co _ emission",
    ", however , no correlation is seen and this is readily detected at colours which are similar to those of optically selected qsos , ( @xmath92 ) , whereas co _ absorption _ has thus far only been detected towards much redder sight - lines ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this suggests either that dust does not play as an important role in co emission as in absorption or that the co is physically offset from the sight - line ( to the radio / uv source ) along which the colours are measured .",
    "4 .   at high redshift",
    ", there is evidence that the co emission is physically remote from the source of the continuum emission , meaning that the co is subject to much lower uv fluxes than the cool , neutral gas located within the host galaxy .",
    "we also investigate the possibility that the uv emission arises primarily from star formation , as may be evident through a strong correlation between the uv and co luminosities .",
    "however , it is not clear how much of the ultra - violet emission is due to nuclear activity in these objects , although three of our seven targets appear to be qsos and all seven have radio luminosities typical of agn .",
    "thus , it is possible that a large fraction of uv emission does not arise from star formation and that the presence of co is these uv luminous sources could be explained by self - shielding of the molecular gas or their distance from the continuum source .    whatever the cause , the detection of  and oh absorption at high redshift remains elusive , with wide - band decimetre - wave spectral scans of optically obscured objects being required to detect these tracers of cool gas at high redshift and",
    "perhaps shed light upon the paucity of the star forming reservoir in the locale of warm molecular gas .",
