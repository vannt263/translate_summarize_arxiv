    "since the mesonic channel @xmath9 is strongly inhibited inside nuclei due to pauli blocking , the nonmesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) @xmath10 emerges as the dominant channel . this primary decay can be induced by a neutron ( @xmath11 ) or a proton ( @xmath12 ) with widths @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . during the last two decades quite significant efforts",
    "have been invested in solving the so called nmwd puzzle. this puzzle is related to the large discrepancy between earlier experimental data and theoretical predictions on the nmwd spectra , that yield information about both the primary nonmesonic decay , and the subsequent final state interactions ( fsi ) originated by the nuclear medium .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to analyze in which way the fsi modify the spectra obtained within the independent particle shell model ( ipsm ) , and to find out to what extent it is possible in this way to explain the experimental data .",
    "the spectra that we are interested in are : 1 ) the single - nucleon spectra @xmath15 , as a function of one - nucleon energy @xmath16 , and 2 ) the two - particle - coincidence spectra as a function of : i ) the sum of kinetic energies @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and ii ) the opening angle @xmath19 , @xmath20 . the explicit relationships for these transition probability densities can be obtained by performing derivatives on the appropriate equation for @xmath3  @xcite , s_n(e_n)=,s_n(e_nn)= , s_n(_nn)=. [ 1]the measured spectra are obtained by counting the number of emitted nucleons @xmath21 within the energy bin @xmath22 mev , or the angular bin @xmath23 , always corrected by the detection efficiency . here",
    "we take advantage of the fact that in most of the kek experiments  @xcite @xmath21 are normalized to the number of nmwd processes , @xmath24 , while for the finuda proton spectra @xcite we have at our disposal also the number of produced hypernuclei @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we can explore the following relationships = , = , [ 2]where @xmath26 is the emission rate of protons within the experimentally fixed bin , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the nmwd rate and the total hypernuclear decay rate .",
    "it could be worth noting that @xmath29 , is the sum of mesonic and nonmesonic decay rates .",
    "it is not clear whether one should use experimental or theoretical values for the rates @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , and we will adopt the first possibility . then the correspondences between the theory and data are _ n^th&&_n^exp = ._nm |_kek = _ h .|_finuda .",
    "[ 3]for @xmath30c @xmath31  @xcite , and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical decay widths @xmath33 are : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for the spectra explained in 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "as the one - proton ( one - neutron ) induced decay prompts the emission of an @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) pair the total neutron kinetic energy width is @xmath37 . for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    "are available the data , with the corresponding errors . as for the kinetic energy sums , only the data for yields @xmath41 were reported so far , without specifying their errors  @xcite .",
    "it is not known how @xmath42 and @xmath41 are related with each other , and thus one is forced here to normalize the theoretical results to the data in a similar way as done in ref .",
    "n(e_nn)= _ n(e_nn)e , [ 4]where _ n^exp=_i=1^m y_n^exp(e^i_nn),=_i=1^m s_n(e^i_nn)e , [ 5]with @xmath43 being the number of kinetic energy sum bins , and the barred quantities indicate that and they are constructed with events constrained to @xmath44 mev , and @xmath45 .",
    "within the ipsm the spectra defined in read  @xcite : s_n(e_n)&= & ( a-2)_j_n _ -1^+1 d_nn e_n _ j_n(pp ) , [ 6]s_n(_nn ) & = & ( a-2)_j_n _ 0^e_j_n de_n e_n _ j_n(pp ) , [ 7]s_n(e_nn ) & = & _ j_n _ j_n(pp ) , [ 8]where the summation goes over all occupied single - particle states @xmath46 for a given @xmath47 , and e_n&=&(a-2)(a-1)_j_n - e_n [ ( a-1)^2-^2_nn ] , [ 9 ] e_n&=&^2(a-1)^-2 ,  e_j_n=_j_n , [ 10]_j_n = + _ + _ j_n ,  _ j_n=_j_n .",
    "[ 11]@xmath48 is the nuclear mass , @xmath49 s are the single - particle energies , and @xmath50 is the mass difference between the @xmath4-hyperon and the nucleon . the quantity @xmath51 contains the isospin dependence , as well as the dynamics , which is described by exchanges of complete pseudoscalar ( @xmath52 ) and vector ( @xmath53 ) meson octets with the weak coupling constants from refs .",
    "it is defined in eq .",
    "( 42 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , and depends on center of mass and relative momenta of the @xmath54 pairs , & = & ,  p= , [ 12 ] with @xmath55 , and @xmath56 being the momenta of the emitted particles .",
    "as evaluated from the ipsm eq . .,width=325 ]    after having modelled the primary process , we investigate the fsi through the time evolution of monte carlo samples constructed to represent the decaying nuclear system , making use of a time dependent multicollisional intranuclear cascade schema ( implemented in the crisp code - collaboration rio - so paulo ) .",
    "the initial sample configurations are spherically shaped portions of cold fermi gas with @xmath57 nucleons , where are incorporated the two energetic intruder nucleons resulting from the primary process , with the ipsm spectra s_n(p_n,_nn)== ( a-2)_j_np_n^2 p_n^2_j_n(pp ) , [ 13]which are shown in fig . [ fig1 ] for the emission of the @xmath8 pair , and are the starting configuration for the time evolution of the @xmath48-nucleon system , following the sequence of all possible binaries collisions between nucleons .",
    "a square well potential is included to mimic the nuclear surface , keeping the low energy nucleons bound within the system .",
    "the depth of this potential well is properly chosen in order to have an unperturbed initial configuration without nucleon loss .",
    "in fact , the potential confines low energy nucleons through internal reflections , and permits refractions / deflections of energetic nucleons , as dictated by the tunnelling probability of the charged particles through the nuclear coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "the time order of the nucleon - nucleon collisions during the evolution of the system is reconstructed after each collision between pairs of particles , and their displacement inside the nucleus .",
    "consequently , the many - body configurations are followed step by step in phase space , and in time .",
    "the cascade phase is ended when no particle is able to leave the nuclear volume , and the number of bound nucleons in the residual nucleus does not change anymore .",
    "however , the system still can present some excitation energy compared to a cold nucleon fermi gas .",
    "a thermal decay chain is performed to cool down the post cascade nuclear system by emission of protons , neutrons , and alpha particles , in competition with the fission process  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the fsi were calculated through a monte carlo simulation of all nuclear processes after the primordial nmwd  @xcite , including important features , such as the pauli blocking within both elastic and inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite .",
    "note that the interplay between the ipsm and the intranuclear cascade calculation is done through the initial configuration for the monte carlo simulation , since the two intruder nucleons in initial sample configurations have their energies , momenta , and opening angle determined stochastically from eq . .",
    "another important bridge between the two models is the choice of the isospins for the two nucleons that start the cascade process .",
    "this is also done via a monte carlo sampling of the outgoing channel according to the ipsm value for the @xmath58 ratio in the primary nmwd process .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we have also calculated the ratio between @xmath59 and @xmath60 by considering the emitted @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs in the back - to - back opening angle region @xmath61 , getting the value @xmath62 , in nice agreement with the recently reported experimental result @xmath63  @xcite , where the background uncertainty is @xmath64 . at this point",
    "it is interesting to mention that the ipsm model calculation yields the value @xmath65 .",
    "we can attribute the difference between @xmath66 , and @xmath6 to a possible depletion in the proton emission due the coulomb barrier at the residual nucleus surface , implying that a neutron produced during the primary process have higher probability of leaving the nucleus than a primary proton .",
    "the role played by the fsi on the nmwd has been investigated . for the inclusive nucleon spectra",
    "we have depicted separately the contributions coming from the cascade phase , and the low energy ones coming from the particle evaporation process in the post cascade phase regime .",
    "the importance of the latter nucleons in reproducing the experimental data was put in evidence . in the analysis of angular distributions ,",
    "we have obtained a reasonable agreement for the @xmath7 channel , while the results for the np channel still need to be improved . from the comparison of the @xmath58 ratios before and after the inclusion of fsi",
    ", one sees that these interactions increase the @xmath67 ratio by a factor of @xmath68 , yielding in this way the agreement with the measurement .",
