    "<S> firstly , i report on a recent work carried out with t. hambye and e. de rafael on how to use the large-@xmath0 expansion to calculate unfactorized contributions from the strong penguin operators , and their impact on observables such as @xmath1 and the @xmath2 rule . secondly , based on work done with m. golterman , </S>",
    "<S> i explain how this calculation allows one to predict some rather dramatic consequences for quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this may help explain the present discrepancy between lattice and experimental results for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the emphasis of this article is put on the explanation of the method of calculation used , which is fully analytic . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to build some intuition and understand the role played by the different hadronic scales in determining the size of the different contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the disparity of scales between the kaon and the w masses , the decay process @xmath3 has very large logarithms , such as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of effective field theory allows one to resum all these large logarithms as the renormalization group running of certain new couplings ( the so - called wilson coefficients ) . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients appear in the effective lagrangian where the @xmath5 and all the other heavy particles of the standard model are no longer present , i.e. they have been `` integrated out '' . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this effective lagrangian only the u , d , s quarks and the gluon fields appear explicitly , the effect of the heavy particles being encoded in a set of 10 wilson coefficients and equal number of four - quark operators operators . ] , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are matrices in dirac space ( color indices are suppressed ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effective lagrangian , @xmath9 changes the short - distance properties of green s functions with respect to the full standard model , where the heavy particles were explicit fields in the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> a set of matching conditions ensure that the physics does not change , however . </S>",
    "<S> these matching conditions define wilson coefficients and operators and make the whole construction meaningful so that the scheme dependence appearing in the wilson coefficients cancels that appearing in the four - quark operators matrix elements .    in perturbation </S>",
    "<S> theory all this is very well understood . </S>",
    "<S> two groups have been able to compute the effective lagrangian even to two loops@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , perturbation theory may be a sensible approximation down to the integration of the charm quark , but certainly not to describe the matrix elements of the kaon . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since the kaon is a ( pseudo ) goldstone boson , its dynamics is appropriately described in terms of yet another effective field theory . in the @xmath10 sector , this is given by the chiral lagrangian expansion one has to include the @xmath11 in a nonet . ] : @xmath12\\nonumber \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the pion decay coupling constant @xmath16 is in the chiral limit , i.e. @xmath17  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix field @xmath18 contains the goldstone fields of the corresponding spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd , and @xmath19 stands for the covariant derivative @xmath20 in the presence of external chiral sources @xmath21 and @xmath22 of left and right  handed currents . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian ( [ ewcl ] ) can be thought of as the one obtained from ( [ one ] ) after integrating out all the hadrons but the goldstone octet . </S>",
    "<S> how does one go about matching the two effective field theories ( [ one ] ) and ( [ ewcl ] ) ? at this point </S>",
    "<S> we find it very convenient to use the large-@xmath0 expansion to organize the calculation because , being a systematic expansion in qcd , it can be carried out either with quarks and gluons or with mesons as degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> so , in a way , the large-@xmath0 expansion plays the role of a dictionary between these two languages .    in </S>",
    "<S> the following i will concentrate on how to impose the matching condition for the case of the strong penguin operators @xmath23 where @xmath24 and sum over color indices within brackets is understood . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , since four - quark operators mix among themselves , it makes no sense to consider the contribution from one of them in isolation . </S>",
    "<S> however , as it turns out , if we are willing to restrict ourselves to the leading logarithmic approximation and only to those subleading contributions in @xmath25 which are enhanced by the number of flavors @xmath26 , there is an important simplification since the @xmath27 system closes and no other operator needs be considered through mixing . </S>",
    "<S> i will adopt this simplification in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , let us define the constant @xmath28 in the lagrangian [ ewcl ] as the coupling governing the non - diagonal `` mass term '' @xmath29 for any flavor @xmath30 . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> , we shall take @xmath31 . the matching condition stating that the same term be obtained with the lagrangian ( [ one ] ) reads@xcite    @xmath32    the subscript @xmath33 reminds one that these integrals are uv divergent and </S>",
    "<S> have to be regularized and renormalized , using the same scheme as for the wilson coefficients @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also renormalized accordingly . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) all the unfactorized contributions , of @xmath37 , are contained in the terms proportional to the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the terms proportional to @xmath36 and unity correspond to the factorized contribution from @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively and , formally , are of @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined through the connected four - point green s functions @xmath43 after integration over the solid angle in @xmath44-momentum space in the manner specified in @xcite . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ green ] ) @xmath45 , and similarly all the others . </S>",
    "<S> one then recognizes the pair of fermion bilinears which make up the operators @xmath46 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ penguins ] ) except that they are located at different space - time points . </S>",
    "<S> it is the integral over @xmath47 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) which brings them back to the same point so that , in fact , the matching condition ( [ matching ] ) is nothing but the statement that in the four - quark effective lagrangian of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ one ] ) one can only generate this two - point correlator between @xmath48 and @xmath49 by inserting the combination @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> since the same two - point correlator is proportional to @xmath28 in the language of the chiral effective lagrangian , this explains the origin of the condition ( [ matching ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that if one knew the functions @xmath51 one immediately would be able to compute @xmath28 through eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is of course that these functions are not known . </S>",
    "<S> it is known , however , how they behave both at low and at high values of @xmath52 thanks to chiral perturbation theory and the operator product expansion , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so , if we can find a reliable way to interpolate between the two , our job is done . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , large-@xmath0 comes to help . since in the large-@xmath0 limit </S>",
    "<S> both functions @xmath51 are made out of an infinity of zero - width resonances , they are meromorphic functions . in other words , they only have isolated poles , but no cut . furthermore , they are order parameters of chiral symmetry and would vanish were it not for its spontaneous breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> it follows , therefore , that perturbation theory yields a vanishing result to all orders in @xmath53 and , in particular , there is no parton - model logarithm . with all these considerations , </S>",
    "<S> our choice for the interpolator is then the most natural one , namely a meromorphic function with a _ finite _ number of poles . </S>",
    "<S> the position of these poles will be identified with the resonance masses , and the unknown residues will be determined so that the interpolator reproduces the low- and high-@xmath52 expansions given by chpt and the ope . in mathematics </S>",
    "<S> this is known as a rational approximant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our interpolator constitutes an approximation to the large-@xmath0 curve .    </S>",
    "<S> i would like to emphasize that this approximation _ is _ systematic : the more terms in the ope and chpt are known , the more resonances can be included in the interpolator . although the solution to large-@xmath0 qcd is not known , it is plausible that such an approximation may do a nice job . </S>",
    "<S> for one thing , we are interpolating a qcd green s function in the euclidean . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one should not expect a lot of `` structure '' ; i.e. resonances do not show up as `` peaks '' , unlike in the minkowski region . </S>",
    "<S> for another thing , we interpolate in the gap between the regime governed by chpt and the ope , so the gap does not seem very large ! </S>",
    "<S> of course , in the end , one will have to judge by the results obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> what are the generic properties which one can expect for functions such as @xmath54 ? </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 is a schematic view of the expected typical profile for one such generic qcd green s function , here called @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , at @xmath56 the function reaches a value determined by a typical chiral parameter , such as @xmath16 or @xmath57 , whereas at large @xmath52 it falls off like an inverse power of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the turning point is given by a typical resonance mass , of the order of 1 gev .        </S>",
    "<S> let us come back to the matching condition ( [ matching ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in trying to build some intuition , it is important to keep track of all the different hadronic scales involved in the problem since in qcd there is a very clear hierarchy , namely @xmath58 and this determines the size of the final contribution . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , let us now estimate the size of the unfactorized contributions relative to the factorized ones in the case of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ matching ] ) shows that the factorized contribution from @xmath41 is of order unity . in order to estimate its unfactorized contribution one can use that the shape of @xmath59 is like that of @xmath55 in fig . 1 and therefore @xmath60 up to logarithmic factors </S>",
    "<S> . consequently the ratio of contributions @xmath61 which , although suppressed at large @xmath0 like @xmath62 , is a number of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that this effect is very generic , and does not depend on the particular form of the four - quark operator . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , despite appearances , the contribution from @xmath40 also obeys ( [ ratio ] ) : the factorized contribution is proportional to @xmath63 , but the function @xmath64 has the shape of @xmath55 in fig . 1 multiplying its value at the origin by @xmath65@xcite . this is a consequence of @xmath40 being made up of scalar and pseudoscalar densities rather than left and right currents .    </S>",
    "<S> one simple reason behind the estimate given in ( [ ratio ] ) is that unfactorized contributions know about the scale @xmath66 gev whereas factorization is dominated by chiral parameters , like @xmath16 or @xmath57 , whose typical scales are smaller . factorized contributions do not have `` access '' to the scale @xmath67 . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> it is something similar to the opening - up of a `` new channel '' in a scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no reason to expect the next - to - next - to - leading contribution to be even bigger , with the consequent breakdown of the large-@xmath0 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> since the large contribution is due to the coming into play of a new scale , once all the scales have already appear in the problem there should be no more surprises .    </S>",
    "<S> there is another ( independent ) reason why , in the particular case of @xmath40 , one could have expected large unfactorized corrections : the factorized contribution depends on @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> although the running of @xmath36 with @xmath69 is a @xmath25 effect , in fact , a small change in scale such as going from the rho mass to 1 gev already changes the factorized contribution by roughly a factor of 2 ! </S>",
    "<S> if one takes this as a naive estimate for the @xmath25 corrections , one also concludes that it is not unnatural for these to be large . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it was found that the unfactorized contributions were actually larger than the factorized ones@xcite . within the context of a model , </S>",
    "<S> this was also found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    using that the wilson coefficients can be decomposed as@xcite @xmath70 the coupling constant @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) picks up an imaginary part due to @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain@xcite </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 @xmath73 where the error has been estimated by varying the quark condensate ( which is the source of the biggest uncertainty ) , @xmath74 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was also obtained that @xmath75 with ( [ gew ] ) and ( [ img8 ] ) one can get to an estimate for @xmath76@xcite : @xmath77\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite is a term induced by isospin breaking . using the above value for the condensate , @xmath80 and the physical value for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath82 however , using the recent determination @xmath83 @xcite and including final state interactions as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one obtains instead , @xmath84 this is to be compared to the experimental number , i.e. @xmath85 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lesson is that , due to the difference between the two terms in ( [ eps ] ) , small corrections to either term get amplified making this observable extremely difficult to control . matching the level of precision of the experimental result is going to be a very arduous task .    at present , the lattice determination of @xmath76 @xcite is smaller than the experimental result by roughly a factor of three and differs in sign . </S>",
    "<S> our previous considerations could be of help in understanding this situation . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , on the lattice one does not really have qcd , but a quenched version of it . </S>",
    "<S> this quenched version has some ghost quarks which , although spin one - half particles , are bosons . </S>",
    "<S> they are responsible for canceling the quark contribution in any internal quark loop . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these ghosts dramatically changes the flavor symmetry of the theory from the usual @xmath86 to a graded @xmath87@xcite . as a consequence , an operator like @xmath88 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ penguins ] ) has no longer well - defined transformation properties under the flavor group but it can be decomposed as@xcite [ qchq6 ] _ </S>",
    "<S> 6&=&_6^qs+_6^qns , + _ 6^qs&= & 2(_l^_d_l^ ) ( _ r^^q_r^+_r^^_r^ ) , + _ 6^qns&= & 2(_l^_d_l^ ) ( _ r^^q_r^-_r^^_r^ ) , where @xmath44 is summed over @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the bosonic ( ghost ) quarks . whereas @xmath91 is a singlet under the quenched group @xmath92 , @xmath93 is not . </S>",
    "<S> this fact changes their corresponding chiral properties completely . to leading order in chpt </S>",
    "<S> , these operators may be represented by @xcite [ bosonization]_6^qs & & -^(8,1)_q1(_^ ) + & & + ^(8,1)_q2(2b_0(u m+mu^ ) ) , + _ 6^qns & & f^2^ns_q(uu^ ) , + & = & diag(1,1,1,-1,-1,-1 ) , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 the quark - mass matrix , and @xmath96 is the so - called supertrace . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 represents the non - singlet structure of @xmath93 . comparing eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ewcl ] ) and ( [ bosonization ] ) , one sees that the couplings @xmath98 have a corresponding counterpart in the unquenched theory ( the weak mass term of @xmath99 is not written in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ewcl ] ) ) , but @xmath100 is a total quenching artifact . presently , @xmath100 is neglected in lattice simulations .    notice that @xmath93 is very similar to the electroweak penguin @xmath101 if one makes the replacement @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath100 must obey the same matching condition @xmath103 does , and this leads to@xcite ^ns_q&=&- f_0 ^ 2b_0 ^ 2 ( 1+o ( ) ) . where @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> as to the operator @xmath91 , its contribution to @xmath105 is also given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) in the leading - log approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one can neglect the contribution from @xmath106 in this expression because it is numerically small and , furthermore , @xmath91 and @xmath106 no longer mix in the quenched theory at leading log . </S>",
    "<S> one then concludes that the large unfactorized contributions which were dominant in the unquenched theory are now vanishing due to the fact that @xmath26 is effectively zero , as a consequence of the quark - ghost cancelation ! @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one predicts , therefore , that the result is given by the factorized contribution , which is a _ much smaller _ value for @xmath105 than in the unquenched theory : ^(8,1)_q1&=&-16l_5 f_0 ^ 2 b_0 ^ 2 ( 1+o ( ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if one compares @xmath100 with @xmath105 one finds & = & ~60 , where we have used that @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a small number and obviously questions the validity of neglecting @xmath100 in lattice simulations of @xmath76 as is currently done .    </S>",
    "<S> i would like to conclude by coming back to unquenched qcd and turn to the @xmath2 rule . </S>",
    "<S> this rule can be expressed by the fact that @xmath108 is much larger than @xmath109 , after subtraction of the chiral corrections@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any systematic framework must also face the calculation of these values .    although due to mixing below the charm mass all operators contribute to @xmath110 , at @xmath111 only @xmath112 given by @xmath113 have non - vanishing contributions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these contributions from @xmath114 can be related ( neglecting penguins@xcite ) to the coupling constant @xmath115 governing the local @xmath116 transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , our calculations allow us to add to this the contributions coming from penguin configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the penguin - like contribution from @xmath117 which is obtained by contracting the two @xmath118 quarks is the same as the unfactorized contribution from @xmath106 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matching ] ) , via the replacement @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> one then obtains @xmath120 in spite of the large errors involved i find this result quite encouraging .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath121 can also be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the celebrated relation to @xmath115 and @xmath122@xcite . using the results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one finds @xmath123 in the chiral limit , with a nice agreement with @xmath124 .    </S>",
    "<S> other interesting applications of our approximation to large-@xmath0 qcd include the decays @xmath125 and @xmath126@xcite , hadronic vacuum polarization@xcite and the calculation of the hadronic light - by - light contribution to @xmath127@xcite . </S>"
