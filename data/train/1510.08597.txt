    "studying on nustar j095551 + 6940.8 would help us understand various distinctive characteristics of ulxs , and how an accreting neutron star can be explained as an ulx . to this point , many researchers have paid much attentions .",
    "shao and li ( 2015 ) modeled the formation history of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 .",
    "they suggested that ns in x - ray binary system might significantly contribute to ulx population .",
    "high - mass and intermediate - mass x - ray binary pulsars dominated the ulx population in m82 and milky way like galaxies , respectively .",
    "klu@xmath6niak and lasota ( 2015 ) pointed out that nustar j095551 + 6940.8 would become a millisecond pulsar within @xmath7 , which provided a new way of millisecond pulsar formation in hmxbs .",

    "eksi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that its dipole magnetic field was as strong as @xmath11 according to the torque equilibrium condition .",
    "as expected , it could hold even stronger multi - pole field that suppresses the scattering cross section and increases the eddington luminosity ( eksi & alpar 2003 , canuto et al .",
    "moreover , tong ( 2015a , 2015b ) proposed that nustar j095551 + 6940.8 might be a magnetar in an accreting system , which favored the idea that magnetars were descendants of high mass x - ray binaries ( bisnovatyi - kogan & ikhsanov 2015 ) .",

    "it has been proposed that the accreting magnetar in the close binary system could be used for interpreting the slow rotating ns in 4u 2206 + 54 ( ikhsanov & beskrovnaya 2010 ) .",
    "however , magnetars in binary systems should be the rare case , since the birth rate of magnetar is only ten percent of the normal ns ( lorimer 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be imagined that a successful explanation of the status of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 can help us understand ns as an ulx that exists in binary system .    by means of",
    "the accretion induced ns magnetic field evolution model ( zhang & kojima 2006 ) and ns spin - up formula by ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) , we calculated the evolution of the magnetic field and spin period of a magnetar with the appropriate initial condition to make the evolved spin period fit the status of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 . with the result , we compare its evolutionary track of the magnetic field and spin period with those of the observed pulsar in binary systems .",
    "the paper is organized as below : the model is described in section 2 ; calculations and b - p diagram are presented in section 3 ; and the discussion and summary are included in section 4 .",
    "the model of accretion induced magnetic field decay of a ns was proposed by zhang and kojima ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the accretion material is channeled by the strong magnetic field to the polar cap , where the field lines are expelled towards the out - polar regime and enter into the magnetic equator region . as a result",
    ", the strength of the polar field decays and the piled - up stronger out - polar field lines at equator region are mostly squeezed into the inner crust of the ns . the analytical form of the polar field decay of a ns is obtained , b = , [ zk ] where @xmath13 is a ratio parameter of the accretion mass @xmath14 and the crust mass @xmath15 of a ns .",
    "@xmath16 is with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the initial field at the beginning of the accretion , and @xmath19 is the bottom magnetic field while the magnetosphere is compressed onto the surface of ns , b_f=4.510 ^ 8(g)m_18^m^r_6 ^ -(/0.5 ) ^- , [ bf ] where @xmath20 , m and @xmath21 are the ns accretion rate in units of @xmath22 , the mass in solar mass and radius in units of @xmath23 , respectively . in detail , with the condition of the magnetosphere radius @xmath24 matching the ns radius r , i.e. , @xmath25 , the bottom field @xmath26 is achieved .",
    "generally , @xmath24 is related to the alfv@xmath27n radius @xmath28 r_m = r_a , r_a=3.210 ^ 8(cm)m_17 ^ -_30^m^- , [ ra ] [ rm ] where @xmath29 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath30 and the preferred parameter @xmath31 is usually considered ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; frank et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the evolution of the spin period of a ns in the accretion phase described by ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) is -=5.810 ^ -5(syr^-1 ) [ m^-r_6^i_45 ^ -1]b_12^ ( pl_37^)^2n(_s ) , [ pdot1 ] where @xmath32 is the moment of inertia in units of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is luminosity of the accreting ns in units of @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the polar magnetic field in units of @xmath37 ; the dimensionless torque @xmath38 is n(_s ) = 1.4 ( ) , [ ns ] which is associated with the fastness parameter @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spin frequency of the ns .",
    "@xmath41 is the keplerian frequency at the radius @xmath24 , @xmath42 is the critical value in the range of @xmath43 ( ghosh & lamb 1992 ) .    during the ns spin - up process",
    ", the spin frequency will be constrained by the keplerian orbital frequency of the accreting material at the magnetosphere radius .",
    "therefore , the minimum spin period corresponding to the field strength can be described by the equation of the spin - up line ( or equilibrium period line ) with condition of the spin frequency being the same as the keplerian frequency at the magnetosphere radius ( bhattacharya and van den heuvel 1991 ) : p_eq=0.89(s)b^6/7_12m^-5/7_18 ^ -3/7r_6 ^ 16/7 .",
    "[ spin ] the corresponding line of eq.([spin ] ) has been plotted as the solid line in fig.[md1850 ] with the eddington rate and standard ns parameters , e.g. @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as an accreting ns , nustar j095551 + 6940.8 is a unique source since its luminosity and period variation ( @xmath46 and @xmath2 ) are higher than that of ns in hmxbs ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; bildsten et al . 1997 ; frank et al . 2002 ; liu et al .",
    "so its evolution history may be different from that of the usual x - ray pulsars in hmxbs .",
    "the low field magnetar sgr 0418 + 5729 had been discovered with the dipole magnetic field less than @xmath49 and the strong field of @xmath50-@xmath51 which might be internal ( rea et al . 2010 , 2012 ; turolla et al . 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , we simulate the magnetic field and spin period evolution of a magnetar based on the model of accretion induced polar magnetic field decay of a ns ( zhang & kojima 2006 ) . during the simulation",
    ", we set the initial condition ( accretion rate , initial magnetic field and spin period ) and try to find a magnetar with the evolved values of spin period and period derivative to be the same as those of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 that is spinning up now .",
    "the spin period of the observed magnetar is usually about 10 second with the estimated age @xmath52 ( mereghetti 2008 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & ikhsanov 2014 ; mereghetti et al .",
    "2015 ) . since the companion mass of nustar j095551 +",
    "6940.8 is more than @xmath53 , its main sequence stage before evolving to feed the accretion disk would last for about one million years , during which the magnetar might spin down to about 100 seconds due to the period and lifetime relation of the magnetic dipole emission as @xmath54 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "so the initial spin period ( @xmath55 ) of the accreting magnetar is chosen to be @xmath56 .",
    "the initial magnetic field is set to be the usual values of magnetar as @xmath57 .",
    "employing the evolution formula of b and p given in section 2 , the evolved path of b and p for nustar j095551 + 6940.8 are calculated and plotted in fig.[md1850 ] .    in order to calculate the present magnetic field of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 ,",
    "the spin period @xmath1 and period derivative @xmath2 are used in eq.([pdot1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the simulated model curve in the b - p diagram ( fig.[md1850 ] ) requires the accretion rate to be @xmath58 , and the obtained magnetic field is @xmath59 .",
    "for such a result , the b - p position of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 is included in its evolutionary path .",
    "from the b - p evolutionary history , the source might accrete @xmath60 within about @xmath61 , which feeds the field reduction and spins up the magnetar to the present state .",
    "the fastness parameter is @xmath62 , by which we get the parameter @xmath63 under the condition of the critical value @xmath42 being @xmath64 ( ghosh & lamb 1992 ) . the value of the fastness parameter is less than @xmath42 which means nustar j095551 + 6940.8 is now in the spin - up process . as the continuing decreasing of the spin period , @xmath65 increases to the critical spin period @xmath42 and the spin - up torque vanishes .    ,",
    "@xmath58 and the observed spin period @xmath1 .",
    "the dash line represents the simulated evolutionary path of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 with the initial field of @xmath57 and spin period of 100s , as depicted in the figure .",
    "the dash - dotted line and solid line are the spin up line with the accretion rate @xmath58 and the eddington accretion rate , respectively . with the data from atnf pulsar catalogue ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) , we plot the b - p position of observed binary pulsars with dots and two isolated millisecond pulsars above the eddington spin up line with triangles . ,",
    "we deduce that nustar j095551 + 6940.8 could be an evolving magnetar which is now spinning up . with the initial magnetic field and spin period ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , the simulation shows that the current magnetic field of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 has been deducted to @xmath3 with @xmath68 in about @xmath7 , while the accretion material is about @xmath69 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 depends on its companion mass . in the binary system ,",
    "the b - p evolution of a ns is mainly affected by the companion mass , which is associated with the accretion lifetime ( pan et al .",
    "the companion mass of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 is more than @xmath70 ( bachetti et al .",
    "2014 ) , which will lead to two kinds of possible evolutionary descendants : ( a ) if the companion is a @xmath71 star , the disk accretion can last @xmath72",
    ". the accretion material will be about @xmath73 which can make nustar j095551 + 6940.8 to be a millisecond pulsar with the polar magnetic field of @xmath74 and the spin period about @xmath75 , while the super - strong out - polar field is squeezed into the ns core region .",
    "there will be a millisecond pulsar and a heavy white dwarf left in the binary system after the accretion .",
    "\\(b ) if the companion is a @xmath76 star , the ns may accrete about @xmath77 within @xmath78 .",
    "a double ns system will * exist * at the end of the accretion , where the recycled pulsar is similar to the hulse - taylor pulsar psr 1913 + 16 with the dipole magnetic field of @xmath79 and spin period of @xmath80 .",
    "the evolutionary track of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 in the b - p diagram above the eddington spin - up line has been simulated ( the dash line in fig.[md1850 ] ) . from the theoretical consideration",
    ", the distribution of binary pulsars should be below the eddington spin up line ( pan et al .",
    "2015 ) , since the minimum spin period of binary pulsar is arisen by the equilibrium period line with the eddington accretion rate .",
    "however , the radio observations show that 9 binary pulsars ( out of 250 ones ) lie above the eddington spin - up line ( see fig.[md1850 ] in this paper , also see fig.4 in pan et al .",
    "we proposed that some of the 9 binary pulsars have experienced the similar evolutions with the super - eddintion accretion to that of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 .",
    "that is to say , some of them may be the descendants of magnetars after accretion .",
    "moreover , the evolved track of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 can also be used to explain the formation of the millisecond pulsar with the magnetic field as high as @xmath81 , e.g. , two isolated millisecond pulsars b1821 - 24a and b1820 - 30a marked in fig.[md1850 ] , whose companions are believed to be evaporated after formations ( hessels 2008 ; kluzniak 1988 )",
    ".    now , we may have a whole picture of the evolutionary history of accreting ns in the b - p diagram : ns in high mass x - ray binary system and ns in low mass x - ray binary system evolve to the recycled pulsars below the eddington spin - up line , while the descendants of ultra - luminous accreting magnetars stop at the b - p positions above the eddington spin - up line , from where they begin their further spin - down evolutions by electromagnetic emission .",
    "the birth rate of magnetar is about @xmath82 compared with that of normal nss ( lorimer 2008 ) , so the number of accreting magnetar systems shown as the ultra - luminous neutron star in hmxbs should be also @xmath83 of the normal ns in hmxbs .",
    "moreover , from the radio observations , only 9 of 250 binary pulsars lie above the eddington spin - up line , thus we infer that the ratio of accreting magnetars to ns in x - ray binaries should be at the scale of 4% . until now ,",
    "about a hundred of x - ray ns binary systems are observed ( liu et al .",
    "therefore , it can be inferred that there would be a couple of ulxs to be accreting magnetars that are similar to nustar j095551 + 6940.8 .      based on the model of accretion induced polar magnetic field decay of the ns ( zhang & kojima 2006 ) , the polar magnetic field would decay one half order of magnitude after accreting @xmath84 , e.g. , from @xmath8 to @xmath85 . at the same time , the out - polar field is slightly increased , which keeps almost the same as the initial value of @xmath8 . for the model",
    "acquires the magnetic flux conserving globally , the dilution of the polar field lines will be compensated by the expanding out - polar field lines .",
    "the strong out - polar field lines will be totally squeezed into the ns core after accreting the mass about 0.1 .",
    "the result shows that the polar field of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 decays about two magnitude orders , from @xmath86 to @xmath87 after accreting 0.005 .",
    "the out - polar field is almost unchanged compared with the initial value of @xmath86 .",
    "the difference of the magnetic field strength between the polar region and equator region will intensely arise the asymmetry of the magnetic field structure of the ns , which makes the accretion structure of the evolved magnetar in hmxb far from the spherical geometry .",
    "the eddington luminosity , which requires a condition of the spherical accretion ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; frank et al .",
    "2002 ) , will be destroyed by the exotic magnetic field structure .",
    "in addition , the super - strong multipole field structure induces the reduction of the scattering cross section of photon - electron , and in turn increases the eddington critical luminosity ( eksi et al 2015 ; laycock et al .",
    "2015 ) .      in the simulation , the accretion rate @xmath58 is obtained by consisting the observed spin period and derivative of nustar j095551 + 6940.8 with the calculation values . to settle the ultra luminosity difficulty , we propose two types of accretions for magnetar in hmxb , i.e. , the radial random accretion @xmath88 without bringing orbital angular momentum and the disk accretion @xmath89 that contributes to the ns spin - up ,",
    "thus the total accretion rate can be divided into two components , = + .",
    "the components of the two type accretions should be correlated to the ns magnetic structure , disk thickness and accretion environment . for the usual ns in hmxb ,",
    "the two accretion components are comparable @xmath90 , so the source luminosity is comparable with the disk accretion luminosity @xmath91 , which is no bigger than the eddington limit",
    ". however , for the magnetar as an ulx in hxmb , the local super - strong field destroys the spherical accretion geometry and breaks the limit of the eddington luminosity .",
    "the structure of the super strong multipole field dominates the radiation mechanism and leads the emission to be beamed .",
    "so , the beaming factor @xmath92 can be introduced for the accretion luminosity @xmath93 that is associated with the x - ray luminosity @xmath94 : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 ( feng and soria , 2011 ) . for ulx nustar j095551",
    "+ 6940.8 , when assuming the pulsed fraction to be 0.05 ( king and lasota , 2016 ) , then the accretion rate @xmath97 of the simulation would be reasonable to infer the radial random accretion rate as @xmath98 , which can account for the observed ultra luminosity ( @xmath99 ) of the source .",
    "therefore , the source accretes about @xmath100 through the polar channel as calculated from the simulation , which implies @xmath101 to be accreted through the non - polar random accretion .",
