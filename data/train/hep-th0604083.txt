    "we see therefore that due to quantum gravity effects the space - time from operational point of view ceases to be a continuous manifold , but becomes a discrete set of small cells with the planck length size @xmath25 .",

    "the role of noncommutative geometry in the ultimate unification of all interactions - the @xmath118-theory - appears to be important and should be further explored .",
    "now however the main challenge is to find among experimental data in high energy physics and astrophysics the ones which indicate the violation of the postulates of einstein special relativity theory ( e.g. constant velocity of light , classical conservation law of fourmomenta , classical energy momentum dispersion relation , isotropy of `` empty '' space - time etc . ) .",
