    "<S> the hole - state random phase approximation ( hrpa ) and the particle - state random phase approximation ( prpa ) for systems like odd @xmath0 nuclei are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these hrpa and prpa are formulated based on the hartree - fock ground state . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of hrpa and prpa based on a correlated ground state is given using time - dependent density - matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> applications to the single - particle states around @xmath1o are presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that inclusion of ground - state correlation affects appreciably the results of hrpa and prpa . </S>",
    "<S> the question of the coupling of the center of mass motion of the core to the particle ( hole ) is also discussed . </S>"
