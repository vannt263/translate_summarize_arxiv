    "<S> drag reduction by polymers in wall turbulence is bounded from above by a universal maximal drag reduction ( mdr ) velocity profile that is a log - law , estimated experimentally by virk as @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mean streamwise velocity and the distance from the wall in  wall \" units . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this mdr profile is an edge solution of the navier - stokes equations ( with an effective viscosity profile ) beyond which no turbulent solutions exist . </S>",
    "<S> this insight rationalizes the universality of the mdr and provides a maximum principle which allows an ab - initio calculation of the parameters in this law without any viscoelastic experimental input .    </S>",
    "<S> the mean streamwise velocity profile in newtonian turbulent flows in channel geometries satisfies the classic von - krmn  log - law of the wall \" which is written in wall units as @xmath3 here @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the streamwise , wall - normal and spanwise directions respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wall units are defined as follows : let @xmath7 be the fixed pressure gradients @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the mid - height of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> then the reynolds number , the normalized distance from the wall @xmath2 and the normalized mean velocity @xmath10 ( which is in the @xmath4 direction with a dependence on @xmath5 only ) are defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the law ( [ karman ] ) is universal , independent of the nature of the newtonian fluid ; it is one of the shortcomings of the theory of wall - bounded turbulence that the von - krmn constant @xmath13 and the intercept @xmath14 are only known from experiments and simulations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most significant experimental findings @xcite concerning turbulent drag reduction by polymers is that in channel and pipe geometries the velocity profile ( with polymers added to the newtonian fluid ) is bounded between von - krmn s log - law and another log - law which describes the maximal possible velocity profile ( maximum drag reduction , mdr ) @xcite , @xmath15 this law , which had been discovered experimentally by virk ( and hence the notation @xmath16 ) , is also claimed to be universal , independent of the newtonian fluid and the nature of the polymer additive , including flexible and rigid polymers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the coefficient @xmath16 is presently known only from experiments , @xmath17 , giving a phenomenological mdr law in the form @xcite @xmath18 for sufficiently high values of   and concentration of the polymer , the velocity profile in a channel is expected to follow the law ( [ final ] ) . for finite  , finite concentration and finite extension of the polymers one expects cross - overs back to a velocity profile parallel to the law ( [ karman ] ) , but with a larger mean velocity ( i.e. with a larger value of the intercept @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the cross - overs are not universal in the sense that they depend on the nature of the polymers and the flow conditions ; the cross - overs are discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while we still can not predict from first principles the parameters in von - krmn s log - law , the aim of this letter is to identify the mdr log - law as an edge turbulent state in wall bounded flows , leading to a derivation of the parameters appearing in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finalexp ] ) without any viscoelastic input . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation follows from the theory of drag reduction by polymers that was developed recently , and therefore a short summary of the main aspects of the theory is in order .    </S>",
    "<S> wall bounded turbulence in newtonian fluids is discussed @xcite by considering the fluid velocity @xmath20 as a sum of its average ( over time ) and a fluctuating part : @xmath21 the objects that enter the newtonian theory are the mean shear @xmath22 , the reynolds stress @xmath23 and the kinetic energy @xmath24 : @xmath25 in the presence of dilute polymers added to the newtonian fluid one needs to complement these statistical objects with the dimensionless  </S>",
    "<S> conformation tensor \" @xmath26 which stems from the ensemble average of the dyadic product of the end - to - end distance of the polymer chains , normalized by its equilibrium value @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the way that the conformation tensor appears in the additional stress tensor which appears in the viscoelastic equations of motion is model dependent ; it is different for flexible and rigid polymers , and it also depends on the actual model of the polymers . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless it was shown theoretically @xcite that both for rigid and flexible polymers one can write down eventually the balance equations for momentum and energy at distance @xmath5 away from the wall as @xmath28k(y)&= & w(y)s(y ) \\   , \\label{finalbalevis}\\\\ \\nu(y ) & \\equiv & \\nu_0 +    c   \\nu_p \\langle r_{yy}\\rangle \\ . </S>",

( [ eeffvis ] ) where @xmath31 is the viscosity due to the polymers in the limit of zero shear and @xmath32 is a constant of the order of unity . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finalbalevis ] ) the first term on the left hand side is the combined newtonian and polymer contributions to the energy dissipation , the second models the inertial energy fluxes , and the right hand side is the ( exact ) energy production rate . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 are dimensionless and of the order of unity .    as in the newtonian case , </S>",
    "<S> the balance equations need to be supplemented by a relation between @xmath24 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> rigorously the cauchy - schwartz ineqality leads to @xmath35 ; experimentally one find that @xmath36 with @xmath37 apparently @xmath5-independent outside the viscous boundary layer . to derive the functional form of the mdr </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one asserts that the terms containing @xmath30 in the balance equations ( [ finalmom ] ) and ( [ finalbalevis ] ) overwhelm the inertial terms , and then together with ( [ wk ] ) one derives @xmath38 which is the log - law for the mdr . </S>",
    "<S> consisten with this law the effective viscosiy turns to be linear in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the viscosity of course increases the dissipation , but it was argued that the momentum flux @xmath39 is reduced even further , leading to an increase in the mean momentum of the flow ( for a given pressure head ) , i.e. drag reduction . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to argue @xcite that the slope of the new log - law is larger that the slope in von - krmn s log - law , and hence drag reduction is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , since neither @xmath37 nor the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 in ( [ finalbalevis ] ) are known apriori , the actual slope of the mdr could not be determined . </S>",
    "<S> this shortcoming is remedied in the rest of this letter .    the crucial new insight that will explain the universality of the mdr and furnish the basis for its calculation </S>",
    "<S> is that the mdr is a marginal flow state of wall - bounded turbulence . in other words </S>",
    "<S> this is the solution of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finalmom ] ) and ( [ finalbalevis ] ) for which @xmath22 ( or equivalently , the velocity profile ) is the maximal possible for any turbulent solution . attempting to increase @xmath40 further results in the collapse of the turbulent solutions in favor of a stable laminar solution @xmath41 . as such </S>",
    "<S> , the mdr is universal by definition , and the only question is whether a polymeric ( or other additive ) can supply the particular effective viscosity @xmath30 that drives eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finalmom ] ) and ( [ finalbalevis ] ) to attain the marginal solution that maximizes the velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the same marginal state will exist in numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations furnished with a @xmath5-dependent viscosity @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> there will be no turbulent solutions with velocity profiles higher than the mdr .    to see this explicitly , we first rewrite the balance equations in wall units . define @xmath42 , taken for simplicity as @xmath5-independent </S>",
    "<S> ; we know from the newtonian limit ( in which @xmath43 ) that @xmath44 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once we write the equations with @xmath30 the ratio @xmath45 can change drastically , and we denote it below by @xmath46 . with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> the balance equations are written as @xmath51 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bal2 ] ) @xmath52 when @xmath53 ( the newtonian limit ) . the bunch of numerical constants in the second term on the lhs of ( [ bal2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> was replaced with @xmath54 in agreement with newtonian log - law when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the second term on the left hand side of eq.([bal2 ] ) ( which vanishes at the mdr ) contains a factor @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this factor is omitted for simplicity ; accounting for this factor complicates slightly the algbra , leaving the final conclusions unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> substituting now @xmath56 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bal1 ] ) into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bal2 ] ) leads to a quadratic equation for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation has as a zero solution for @xmath58 ( laminar solution ) as long as @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> turbulent solutions are possible only when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus at the edge of existence of turbulent solutions we find @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising , since it was observed already in previous work that the mdr solution is consistent with an effective viscosity which is asymptotically linear in @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore sufficient to seek the edge solution by maximizing the velocity profile with respect to linear viscosity profiles , and we rewrite eqs . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{pr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now endow @xmath64 with an explicit dependence on the slope of the effective viscosity , @xmath65 when @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath67 the ratio @xmath68 is expected to depend on @xmath69 ( drag reduction involves a reduction in @xmath39 ) , and this dependence is an important part of the following theory . </S>",
    "<S> we can present @xmath70 in terms of a dimensionless scaling function @xmath71 , @xmath72 obviously , @xmath73 . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> we show that the balance equation ( [ pr1 ] ) and ( [ pr2 ] ) ( with the prescribed form of the effective viscosity profile ) have an non - trivial symmetry that leaves them invariant under rescaling of the wall units . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry dictates the function @xmath70 in the form @xmath74 armed with this knowledge we can now find the maximal possible velocity far away from the wall , @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> there the balance equations simplify to @xmath76 these equations have the @xmath2-independent solution for @xmath57 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 obviously , ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) , the supremum of @xmath77 is obtained when @xmath58 vanishes , which happens precisely when @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta ] ) we find the solution @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 . using the estimate @xmath44 we get the final prediction for the mdr . using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) with @xmath83 , we get    @xmath84    this result is in close agreeement with the empirical law ( [ finalexp ] ) proposed by virk . note that the numbers appearing in virk s law correspond to @xmath85 , which is well within the error bar on the value of this newtonian parameter . note </S>",
    "<S> that we can easily predict where the asymptotic law turns into the viscous layer upon the approach to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> we can consider an infinitesimal @xmath58 and solve eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bal1 ] ) and ( [ bal2 ] ) for @xmath56 and the viscosity profile . </S>",
    "<S> the result , as before , is @xmath86 . since the effective viscosity can not fall bellow the newtonian limit @xmath87 we see that the mdr can not go below @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus expect an extension of the viscous layer by a factor of 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the result @xmath89 should not be interpreted as @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the differeence between the two objects is the factor of @xmath90 , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> since the mdr is reached asymptotically as @xmath92 , there is enough turbulence at this state to stretch the polymers to supply the needed effective viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless our discussion is in close correspondence with the experimental remark by virk @xcite that close to the mdr asymptote the flow appears laminar .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , one can probably improve further the model of the newtonian wall - bounded flow , making it more elaborate and more precise . </S>",
    "<S> but the message of this letter will stay unchanged ; whatever is the model of choice , once endowed with effective viscosity @xmath30 instead of @xmath12 , there would exist a profile of @xmath30 that would result in a maximal possible velocity profile at the edge of existence of turbulent solutions . </S>",
    "<S> that profile is the prediction of the said model of choice for the mdr . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we offer a prediction for simulations : direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations in a channel , endowed with a linear viscosity profile @xcite , will not be able to support turbulent solutions when the slope of the viscosity profile exceeds the critical value that is in correspondence with the slope of the mdr . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding , it is gratifying to discover that even a simple model of the balance of energy and momentum is sufficient , in light of the insight presented in this letter , to predict ab - initio the functional form _ and _ the parameters that determine the maximum drag reduction asymptote . </S>"
