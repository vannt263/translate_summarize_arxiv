    "within the class of expected utility maximization problems in economic theory , the special case of maximizing expected _ logarithmic _ utility has undoubtedly attracted considerable attention .",
    "the major reason for its celebrity is the computational advantage it offers : the use of the logarithmic function allows for explicit solutions of the optimal investment  consumption problem in general semimartingale models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in many diverse applications , optimal portfolios stemming from expected log - utility maximization are crucial .",
    "we mention , for example , the problem of quantifying the additional utility of a trader using insider information ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , as well as the use of the log - optimal portfolios as benchmarks in financial theory , as is presented in  @xcite .    the emergence of expected log - utility maximization dates as back as 1738 , when daniel bernoulli offered a solution to the st .",
    "petersburg paradox , which can be found in the translated manuscript @xcite .",
    "bernoulli s use of the logarithmic ( and , indeed , of any other increasing and concave ) utility function was ad - hoc and lacked any axiomatization based on rational agent s choice behavior . in the context of financial choice",
    ", @xcite seems to be the first work that has proposed maximizing growth as a reasonable optimization criterion , which is exactly consistent with expected log - utility optimization .",
    "after kelly s information - theoretical justification of using growth - optimal strategies in @xcite , there had been further attempts to justify maximizing expected log - utility , for example , in @xcite .",
    "along came heavy criticism by distinguished scholars , notably by samuelson ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the interest in log - optimality has not ceased , and is even growing .",
    "statistical or behavioral tests do not seem to uniformly favor one side or the other ; for example , long s work @xcite , which has inspired some of the recent development , fails to answer with statistical significance the question whether the log - optimal portfolio coincides with the market portfolio .    in spite of all the debate that has prolonged over the years",
    ", there has been no attempt in the realms of the theory of choice to investigate the exact behavioral axioms that , when imposed , would explain the cases where agents act as if they are maximizing expected logarithmic utility under a subjective probability measure .",
    "of course , there has been immense work on axiomatizing agent s preferences , with @xcite being the first example where axioms were imposed ensuring that agents act like they are maximizing expected utility over lotteries with a known statistical nature of the uncertain environment .",
    "savage s work @xcite provided an axiomatic framework where both the statistical views and the utility function came as a byproduct .",
    "since then , there have been numerous successful efforts in relaxing in some direction the axioms in order to explain agents behavior in more depth . in all these works , the representation of preferences via utilities of logarithmic shape does not appear to have any form of significance .",
    "naturally , there are descriptive characterizations aplenty ; for example , one could argue that agents that act consistently with maximizing expected log - utility have constant , and equal to unit , relative risk aversion .",
    "however , a normative characterization seems to be absent in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the aforementioned issue .",
    "certain axioms are proposed on the choice of agents amongst random outcomes that result in the following preference representation : agents act as if they were making choices based on the _ expected relative rate of return _ of an outcome with respect to some alternative based on a _ subjective _ probability measure . in particular , an outcome will be preferred over another if the expected relative rate of return of the latter with respect to the former outcome is nonpositive .",
    "choices based on the previous rule are closely connected to preferences stemming from a numerical representation of expected logarithmic utility , as can be seen using first - order conditions for optimality .",
    "actually , we shall discuss how one can extend preferences based on expected relative rates of return to preferences that have a numerical representation of expected logarithmic utility , by imposing an extra transitivity axiom .",
    "however , working with expected relative rate of return is far more appealing , as the agent is not forced to express a preference between all pairs of alternatives ; in other words , the preference relation will not be complete .",
    "the agent is only required to be able to make choices from certain convex _ bundle sets _ ; in this respect , we take a more behavioral route in formulating preferences via _",
    "choice rules_.    the key axiom that is imposed to ensure that an agent makes choices according to the intuitive way described above is the _ numraire invariance _ of preferences  this simply means that the agent s comparison of one outcome to another does not depend on the units that these outcomes are denominated .",
    "this is clearly necessary if we are using expected relative rate of return as a means of comparison , as relative rates of return do not depend on the denomination .",
    "furthermore , preferences with expected logarithmic utility representation are also numraire invariant , as follows from the simple fact that the logarithmic function transforms multiplication to addition .",
    "we also consider the extension of the preferences in a dynamic environment where agents make choices over _ consumption streams_. the theory regarding choice is more or less a straightforward extension of the previous static case ; `` subjective probabilities '' are now defined on a product space of states and time .",
    "the novel element is a decomposition of unit - mass optional measures on the last product space in two parts : one that has the interpretation of subjective views on the state space ( the interpretation being somewhat loose , since it might involve density processes that are local martingales instead of martingales ) and another that acts as an agent - specific consumption clock .",
    "this decomposition , a result that sharpens dolans s characterization of optional measures , allows for a solution of the investment  consumption problem for an agent with numraire - invariant preferences that separates the investment and consumption parts of merton s problem in a general semimartingale - asset - price setting .",
    "a further application discussed in the text is a solution to the pure investment log - utility maximization problem with a time - horizon that is random but not necessarily a stopping time with respect to the agent s information flow .",
    "such problems have lately been discussed in the context of credit risk and defaults ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .    from a mathematical point of view , the results of the present paper concern geometric and topological properties of @xmath0 and , in the dynamic case , of the space of adapted , right - continuous , nonnegative and nondecreasing processes .",
    "the rich structure of the previous very important spaces is still the subject of scrutinized study ( see @xcite ) ; this work contributes to this line of research .",
    "the structure of the paper is simple .",
    "section [ sec : static ] contains all the foundational results for the static case , which includes in particular the axiomatization of numraire - invariant preferences .",
    "the dynamic case is treated in section [ sec : dynamic ] , where the main focus is on a canonical representation of unit - mass optional measures and the applications it has for the numraire - invariant investment  consumption problem , as well as for the numraire property under random sampling .",

    "<S> the simple axioms turn out to be equivalent to the following choice rule : the agent prefers one outcome over another if and only if the expected ( under the agent s subjective probability ) relative rate of return of the latter outcome with respect to the former is nonpositive . with the addition of a transitivity requirement , this last preference relation has an extension that can be numerically represented by expected logarithmic utility . </S>",
    "<S> we also treat the case of a dynamic environment where consumption streams are the objects of choice . </S>",
    "<S> there , a novel result concerning a canonical representation of unit - mass optional measures enables us to explicitly solve the investment  consumption problem by separating the two aspects of investment and consumption . </S>",
