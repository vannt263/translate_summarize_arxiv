    "there has been much recent debate about the deployment of wireless networks that would allow internet access in public areas .",
    "central to this debate is the tradeoff between costs and benefits .",
    "surprisingly , this debate seems to have ignored that the costs and benefits of such wireless networks depend crucially on the technology that is or could be employed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for exploring the influence of technology on the costs and benefits of wireless networks and to demonstrate in a simple scenario that the feasibility and profitability of such a network may depend on the technology chosen .",
    "although we are most interested in the analysis of _ public _ wireless networks , we construct a framework general enough to allow for the analysis of _ private _ wireless networks as well . here",
    ", we identify a network as being public if the operator is benevolent , and seeks to maximize social welfare ; we identify a network as being private if the operator is selfish , and seeks to maximize profit .",
    "we show that the analysis of both public and private wireless networks depends crucially on the technology layer , the application layer , and the economic layer , and most crucially of all , on the interactions between these layers .",
    "indeed , even a proper _ description _ of the environment depends on the interaction between these layers .    to see why the analysis depends crucially on the interactions between the various layers ,",
    "consider a simple but representative scenario .",
    "there are two classes of ( potential ) users : _ email users _ , who are insensitive to throughput and delay , and _ video users _ , who are sensitive to both throughput and delay . in managing the network ,",
    "the service provider can offer a pricing policy , but the service provider s range of choices depends on the technology  in particular , on the medium access control ( mac ) protocol  employed . if time - division multiple access ( tdma ) is employed , the service provider will be able to guarantee the data rate and delay experienced by the users , and thus charge the users according to the guaranteed data rates .",
    "if carrier - sensing multiple access ( csma ) is employed , the service provider will be unable to guarantee the data rate or delay .",
    "absent such performance guarantees , users may be unwilling to pay for the data rates .",
    "as we will show , there are large regions within the range of plausible parameters in which employing tdma rather than csma makes possible large improvements in social welfare .",
    "indeed , there are regions in which employing tdma would be consistent with operating a self - financing network while employing csma would not be .      two substantial bodies of work in the engineering literature ask about optimal behavior of the provider of a wireless network . the first considers a benevolent provider whose objective is to maximize social welfare@xcite@xcite ; the second considers a selfish provider whose objective is to maximize profit@xcite@xcite . while the works in @xcite@xcite study the optimal pricing policies and resource allocation strategies of the provider , more recent works @xcite@xcite also consider the technology selection problem faced by the provider .",
    "our work is unique in that we focus on the _ comparison _ between the optimal behavior of the benevolent provider and the selfish provider in terms of their pricing policies , and perhaps more importantly , the impact of the technology on the optimal behavior of the benevolent and selfish providers .    apart from the focus of the paper , our work differs from existing works in three key elements of the system model .",
    "first , we model prices as real prices actually paid by users and collected by the service providers .",
    "however , the prices in some works @xcite@xcite are not real prices actually paid by the users ; rather , they are control signals used for the purpose of controlling the network congestion .",
    "palomar and chiang @xcite and kelly _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite@xcite consider a network with one service provider serving multiple users and propose charging in proportion to the flow rates of the users in order to maximize social utility .",
    "johari and tsitsiklis @xcite@xcite focus on the efficiency loss under this pricing scheme and a variant with price differentiation .",
    "gibbens and kelly @xcite propose a packet - based pricing policy for more effective flow control . under the same scenario ,",
    "basar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite@xcite@xcite propose linear and nonlinear differentiated pricing schemes to control the network usage and maximize the provider s revenue .",
    "second , we model the users as non - atomic strategic players , who decide whether to enter the network or which pricing plan to choose based on their utility functions .",
    "the price influences the users decisions , which in turn impact the aggregate arrival rate , i.e. the user demand .",
    "however , some works @xcite@xcite use a continuum user model with atomic users that is abstracted by a single parameter , the user demand , which is simply determined as a function of the price ( and maybe the congestion ) .",
    "paschalidis and tsitsiklis @xcite studies a dynamic network with users arriving and leaving the network and derives the optimal pricing strategy and its static approximation .",
    "similarly , starobinski _ et al . _ @xcite@xcite studies optimal pricing strategies in dynamic spectrum access networks .",
    "third , since we focus on the influence of mac protocols in a wireless lan on the optimal behavior of the providers , we model the technology layer closely as the mac layer in wireless networks . we derive analytical expressions for the data rates achieved by mac protocols in our model , in order to determine the utility of the users and their payment based on the pricing policies .",
    "in addition , the congestion experienced by the users is more accurately modeled as experienced in a wireless network using the considered mac protocols . on the contrary ,",
    "most works in @xcite@xcite consider resource allocation in higher layers ( e.g. flow - level resource allocation @xcite@xcite@xcite ) or model the technology as a function that determines the congestion based on the demand @xcite@xcite .",
    "other papers use much different models and have a much different focus .",
    "for example , friedman and parkes @xcite study the existence of implementable mechanisms for the users to truthfully announce their arrivals in wifi networks .",
    "musacchio and walrand @xcite model wifi pricing as a dynamic game involving one access point and one user , and study the nash equilibrium ( ne ) of this game .",
    "we do not discuss all of them due to space limit .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the system model for the three - layer network . in section iii",
    ", we formulate the design problem for the benevolent and selfish providers and the decision process of the users as a two - stage game ( with the provider acting in the first stage and the users acting in the second stage ) . in section iv",
    ", we focus our analysis on a typical scenario to gain insights into this problem , and provide simulation results in this typical scenario .",
    "finally , section v states our conclusions .",
    "we consider a public wireless network , created by a service provider to enable internet connections to potential users in public areas such as parks , libraries , and coffee shops .",
    "we focus on a wireless local area network ( lan ) with a single access point ( ap ) .",
    "the model also applies to wireless lans with multiple aps to cover a larger area , as long as the aps are operated by the same service provider and share the same spectrum . keeping in mind that a wireless lan will typically serve a relatively small number of potential users who may come and go at any moment in time , we build a dynamic continuous - time framework in which a finite number of potential users arrive and depart randomly .    in our framework , the system consists of three layers , namely the _ technology layer _ , the _ application layer _ , and the _ economic layer_. the technology layer includes the mac protocol and the admission control policy chosen by the service provider ; the application layer includes the users utility functions , arrival rates , and service times ; and the economic layer includes the pricing plan offered by the service provider and chosen by the users .",
    "the usual way to describe a system model is to describe separately and in turn each of the layers .",
    "however , in our settings , it is not possible to describe these layers separately because they are interconnected .",
    "instead , we describe the system by the specifications for the service provider and users . in this way",
    ", we can better illustrate the interactions among the components in the system and the behaviors of the service provider and users .    before we begin with the description of the service provider ,",
    "we first introduce the basic concept of the user type .",
    "users _ are categorized into @xmath0 types according to their utility functions and arrival and departure processes .",
    "there are @xmath1 identical users of type @xmath2",
    ".      the service provider must choose a mac protocol , a pricing policy , and an admission control policy .",
    "( here we view the mac protocol as a design choice of the provider .",
    "however , our analysis shows that , even if the mac protocol is _ not _ a design choice , the mac protocol that is used has an important impact on the remainder of the design and performance and in particular on the feasibility of providing service . )",
    "however , before describing these three design parameters , we must note an important _ caveat_. a mac protocol describes which packets of current users will have access to which resources in which way ; an admission control policy describes which users will be admitted to the system .",
    "it would seem that a mac protocol should allocate resources to packets of current users ( or type of users ) , as a function of the current number of users of each type in the system , and that an admission policy should specify whether or not an incoming user of a particular type should be admitted to the system , as a function of the current number of users of each type in the system .",
    "however , the service provider can only use policies that depend on observable characteristics and actions of the users and _ the type of a user can not be observed by the service provider_. in our framework , the relevant observable actions of the users are their choices of pricing plans , so the policies of the service provider should be specified as functions of the choices of pricing plans .",
    "the mac protocol chosen determines the ways in which users may share the channel resources . in principle , the service provider might be able to choose among many mac protocols .",
    "csma and tdma are the canonical mac protocols .",
    "csma is representative of the protocols without a central controller , where the packets contend to get access to the medium .",
    "the widely - used ieee 802.11 standards use csma as the basic mac protocol@xcite .",
    "tdma is representative of the protocols with a central controller , where the packets access the medium in non - overlapping periods of time .",
    "the ieee 802.11e standard enables contention - free access control in the hybrid control function ( hcf ) , which can be considered as a generalized tdma protocol@xcite .",
    "the key difference between csma and tdma is that tdma enables the provider to offer quality of service ( qos ) guarantee , while csma does not .",
    "specifically , the users can guarantee to achieve a certain data rate in tdma , while their data rates may vary greatly because of the probabilistic channel access in csma .",
    "hence , it is impossible to charge the users based on their guaranteed data rates in csma . on the contrary",
    ", a provider using tdma can charge users based on their guaranteed data rates .",
    "we write @xmath3 for a particular protocol .",
    "a _ pricing plan _ is a schedule of charges to ( potential ) users . for simplicity , we assume that charges consist only of a subscription fee ( paid once per billing period ) @xmath4 and a charge @xmath5 per unit for the guaranteed data rate .",
    "of course , the subscription fee or the charge for the guaranteed data rate might be 0 .",
    "thus a pricing plan is @xmath6 note that the charge for the guaranteed data rate is applied to the data rate allocated to a user , instead of the user s actual amount of data usage , in a billing period .",
    "this is reasonable because the user should pay for the bandwidth exclusively allocated to its data , even though it does not use the bandwidth all the time . in csma ,",
    "the bandwidth is not exclusively allocated to a certain user . instead , the users access the channel opportunistically and may get extremely high or low effective bandwidth .",
    "we take account of this by distinguishing the set @xmath7 of pricing plans that can be employed given the mac protocol @xmath3 .    to allow for the possibility that some users choose not to belong to the network at all",
    ", we will require that the service provider always offer a dummy plan @xmath8 .",
    "a user choosing @xmath8 does not subscribe to the network .",
    "a _ pricing policy _ is a vector of pricing plans ; for simplicity , we assume here that each pricing policy is a vector of exactly @xmath9 pricing plans : @xmath10 ; by convention we assume that @xmath11 .",
    "write @xmath12 for the set of all possible pricing policies given the mac control protocol @xmath3 .",
    "given a pricing policy @xmath13 , each user type @xmath2 chooses a pricing plan from @xmath14 by randomizing over all the choices according to a probability distribution .",
    "we define the _ pricing state _ to be the vector @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of users who are currently online and choose the pricing plan @xmath17 .",
    "we write @xmath18 for the set of pricing states .",
    "the admission control policy determines whether a user of a given type should be admitted into the system given the current number of users of each type in the system .",
    "however , as we have noted , the service provider can not observe the types of the current users or of the incoming user , but only the pricing plans they choose , so the admission control policy must depend only on the pricing plans chosen by current users  that is , on what we have called the pricing state  and on the pricing plan chosen by the incoming user . hence , an admission control policy is a function @xmath19 where we interpret @xmath20 to mean admit and @xmath21 to mean do not admit.    the simplest admission control policy admits every potential user : @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . a slightly more complicated admission control policy sets bounds @xmath24 for each @xmath25 and admits a potential user who chooses the pricing plan @xmath23 if and only if doing so does not cause the total number of current users who have chosen plan @xmath23 to exceed the the upper bound @xmath24 : @xmath26 if and only if @xmath27 . the upper bound @xmath24 can be determined according to the total bandwidth available and the bandwidths allocated to the users with different pricing plans .",
    "the users are characterized by their utility functions , arrival processes , and service times . given user characteristics and the technology and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider , each user determines a probability distribution on the choices of pricing plans that maximizes its expected utility ( which will depend on the choices of all the other users ) . at the beginning of time , each user chooses a pricing plan randomly according to the prescribed probability distribution , and sticks to the chosen plan throughout the considered time horizon .",
    "every time a user arrives at the network , the service provider observes the pricing plan chosen by this user .",
    "the service provider will make the admission control and medium access control according to the current pricing state and the choice of a particular user .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ systemmodel ] for an illustration of an example system with two types of users .",
    "users choose pricing plans to maximize their expected utility , given the menu of pricing plans , the mac protocol and the admission control policy of the provider , and the choices of other users .",
    "we allow for the possibility that users _ randomize _ to choose a pricing plan at the beginning of time .",
    "we write @xmath28 for the probability that a user of type @xmath2 chooses plan @xmath23 ; in particular , @xmath29 is the probability of choosing the dummy plan @xmath21 . for each @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath30 . write @xmath31 $ ] for the ( random ) action of type-@xmath2 users , @xmath32 for the action profile of all the users , and @xmath33 for the action profile of users of types other than @xmath2 . allowing for randomization guarantees that equilibrium exists .",
    "we may interpret randomization literally : users who are indifferent over various plans break their indifference in a random way .",
    "alternatively , we may interpret randomization simply as uncertainty in the minds of the provider and other users .",
    "if the number of users is large , we can also interpret the probability distribution over pricing plans as the distributions of plans among the population @xcite .",
    "the randomization is realized at the beginning of time .",
    "represent the result of the randomization by a set of vectors @xmath34,\\ldots,[n_{k,0},\\ldots , n_{k , l}]\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath35 being the number of type-@xmath2 users choosing plan @xmath23 .      the _ system state _ , or the _ true state _ ,",
    "is defined as the number of online users of each type choosing each pricing plan .",
    "specifically , the system state @xmath36 is a @xmath37 matrix , with @xmath38 as the element at the @xmath2th row and @xmath39th column , representing the number of type-@xmath2 users who choose plan @xmath40 and are currently in the network .",
    "the system state @xmath36 is in @xmath41 , the set of admissible system states under the admission control policy @xmath42 and the result of the randomization @xmath43 .",
    "the system state depends on arrivals and departures of users and on the admission control policy of the service provider , and thus is random .",
    "we write @xmath44 for the stochastic process of system state evolution .",
    "we assume that the type of a user is a private characteristic , known to the user but generally unobservable by other users and the service provider . as a result",
    ", the system state can not be observed by anyone in the system .      for simplicity",
    ", we assume the arrival process and service time are exogenously given but not choice variables .",
    "we use a continuous - time model ( reflecting the fact that users might arrive / depart at any moment ) ; as in @xcite , we assume that the users arrive independently and the arrival process of type-@xmath2 users choosing plan @xmath23 is poisson with arrival rate @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the individual arrival rate of a type-@xmath2 user .",
    "note that the aggregate arrival rate @xmath47 is proportional to the number of users currently outside the network @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the service time of one type-@xmath2 user is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath49 , and that different users leave the network independently .",
    "hence , the aggregate departure rate of type-@xmath2 users choosing plan @xmath23 is @xmath50 note that our results , based on the analysis of the steady state , hold true for other probability distributions of the arrival and departure processes .",
    "we fix a _ billing period _ of length @xmath51 , which is typically one month .",
    "subscription fees are charged at the beginning of each billing period ; other fees are charged at the end of each billing period .",
    "this is consistent with the usual billing methods : people pay a subscription fee prospectively and other charges retrospectively . for convenience , we assume that neither the provider nor the users discount utility and cost over the billing period .      the service provider and the users evaluate the social welfare and their satisfaction , respectively , by the _ expected utility _ , defined as the expectation of the total utility over a billing period when the stochastic process of the system state @xmath44 reaches the steady state .",
    "each user s total utility consists of two components : utility of use and disutility of cost . to keep the model simple , we assume that total utility is simply the sum of utility of use and disutility of cost and is linear in cost with marginal utility of cost equal to @xmath20@xcite : @xmath52    we denote the expected utility of use of a type-@xmath2 user by @xmath53 ,",
    "if the mac protocol is @xmath3 , the admission control policy is @xmath42 , and the joint probability distribution over pricing plans is @xmath54 .",
    "we can calculate the expected utility of use @xmath53 as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the conditional probability that the randomization results in @xmath43 given that one type-@xmath2 user chooses plan @xmath23 after randomization , and @xmath57 is the steady - state utility of use of a type-@xmath2 user , if the mac protocol is @xmath3 , the admission control policy is @xmath42 , and the realization of the randomization is @xmath43 .",

    "[ def : ne ] @xmath54 is a ( symmetric ) nash equilibrium of the game @xmath86 if for all @xmath2 , @xmath87    since we use @xmath76 for the action of all the type-@xmath2 users , the ne defined above is a symmetric ne .",
    "in this section , we formulate the interaction between the service provider and the users as a stackelberg game .",
    "the service provider chooses a mac protocol , a pricing policy , and an admission control policy , foreseeing nash equilibria of the plan selection game played by the users .",
    "the design problem of the service provider is therefore to find a mac protocol @xmath3 , a pricing policy @xmath14 , and an admission control policy @xmath42 , so that at an equilibrium of the plan selection game @xmath86 , the social welfare ( for the benevolent provider ) or the total revenue ( for the selfish provider ) is maximized , subject to the constraint that costs be covered .",
    "note that our notion of solution assumes that the service provider knows the arrival rates , service times , and utility functions of all types of users ( but does not know the type of a particular user ) , and foresees the behavior of the users .",
    "the users in turn must also know the behavior of other users .",
    "implicitly , therefore , we view the outcome as involving some learning process that is not modeled here .",
    "we intend to address this issue in later work , while focusing on characterizing the system performance at the equilibria in this paper .    under the above assumptions",
    ", we can formulate the design problem of the service provider as follows . for a benevolent service provider aiming at maximizing the social welfare ,",
    "its design problem can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the social welfare defined as the sum utility of all the users , @xmath90 is the fixed cost for the service provider during a billing period due to the maintenance of the network , and @xmath91 is the indicator function of the event @xmath92 .",
    "the second constraint is the individual rationality constraint for the service provider , which says that the provider needs a revenue large enough to cover the cost of running the network .",

    "similarly , for a selfish service provider aiming at maximizing its own revenue , its design problem can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the revenue defined as the total payment of all the users .    because our focus is the influence of technology on the economic layer and system performance",
    ", we will first solve the design problems of the providers with a fixed mac protocol and admission control policy , and then compare the optimal pricing policies and the resulting system performance under different mac protocols and admission control policies .    even for a fixed technology , the general design problem for",
    "the service provider may not be easy to solve because the provider must , in principle , foresee the nash equilibrium behavior of users in the plan selection game following all possible pricing policies and must take into account that such nash equilibrium might not be unique . as we shall see , however , the design problem is tractable in some settings that provide useful insights .    before moving to the detailed analysis",
    ", we first guarantee the existence of nash equilibrium in the general settings .    in the plan selection game @xmath86",
    ", there always exists a nash equilibrium as defined in definition  [ def : ne ] .",
    "the plan selection game @xmath86 is a finite game ; nash shows that such a game has a nash equilibrium ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1 ) .",
    "moreover , since the users of the same type are symmetric , there exists a symmetric nash equilibrium in which the users of the same type choose the same action ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) .",
    "in this section , we study two typical scenarios . in both scenarios , there are two types of users : type-1 users are video users with stringent throughput and delay requirements , while type-2 users are email users , who require low throughput and can tolerate large delay .",
    "we assume that the instantaneous utility of type-@xmath2 users is a concave function of the form @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the throughput .",
    "@xmath101 represents the highest instantaneous utility a type-@xmath2 user can get , and @xmath102 reflects the rate of increase of utility with respect to the throughput .",

    "we first assume @xmath103 to reflect the fact that video users can get higher utility if the throughput is large .",
    "we also assume @xmath104 , because video users need a higher throughput to get positive utility .",
    "note that the delay is not included in the utility function for simplicity , because higher throughput comes with lower delay in the csma and tdma protocols considered in our paper .",
    "thus , the user preference can be characterized by a utility function dependent solely on the throughput .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the service provider uses csma , can not guarantee the data rate of a specific user , and can only offer a pricing plan with a subscription fee alone . in the second scenario ,",
    "the service provider uses tdma , can guarantee the data rate of each user , and can offer a plan with a subscription fee and a charge proportional to the date rate .",
    "we characterize the system performance at the equilibria in both scenarios .",

    "the selfish provider compares the revenue achievable at nine types of ne .",
    "the procedure to solve the selfish provider s design problem under csma is summarized in table  [ procedure_selfish_csma ] .",
    ".procedure to solve the benevolent provider s design problem under csma .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     using tdma enables the provider to charge users for the guaranteed data rates , which results in higher social welfare or revenue .",
    "however , as we can see from table  [ procedure_benevolent_tdma ] and table  [ procedure_selfish_tdma ] , the provider has to perform exhaustive search for the highest social welfare or revenue achievable at certain types of ne , due to the complicated expression for the expected data rate .",
    "more specifically , the provider can analytically solve the cases of the four types of ne with no user being mixed , but needs exhaustive search for the cases of the five types of ne in which at least one type of users are mixed .",
    "hence , to achieve optimal performance , the provider using tdma has a higher computational complexity than the one using csma .",
    "however , the additional complexity is acceptable , because the provider solves the design problem only once prior to the setup of the network .",
    "we illustrate the solutions to the design problems when the providers use tdma .",
    "since the providers objectives do not change in tdma , the difference in the behaviors of the benevolent provider and the selfish provider is similar to the case when they use csma , which has been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "hence , the focus here is the comparison between csma and tdma in terms of the solutions to the design problems and the resulting social welfare and revenue .",
    "first , we show the phase diagram of the optimal types of ne with high - demand video and email users under tdma in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram_tdma_mixedstrategy_usernumber_hh ] .",
    "the parameters in the simulation are the same as those in the previous subsection . compared to the phase diagram under csma in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram_csma_mixedstrategy_usernumber_hh ] , we can see that for both the benevolent and selfish providers , it is more likely that they choose the pricing policies such that both types are in the network , and is less likely that they choose the pricing policies such that one type are out of the network .",
    "this is because under the same number of users , the congestion under tdma is smaller than that under csma .",
    "the difference between the congestion under tdma and that under csma is large especially when the number of users is large , as can be seen from the expressions of the utility of use in of lemma  [ lemma : expressioncsma ] and of lemma  [ lemma : expressiontdma ] : the utility of use under csma decreases exponentially with the number of users , while the utility of use under tdma decreases linearly with the number of users .",
    "since the congestion under tdma is smaller , the providers can obtain high social welfare and revenue at the ne in which both types are in the network .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram_tdma_mixedstrategy_usernumber_hh ] , we assume that the cost is zero , which is the same as the cost of using csma . however , it is more reasonable to assume that the cost of using tdma is higher than that of using csma . in the following ,",
    "we compare the social welfare and the revenue when using tdma and csma under different user number and demand parameters , considering the cost difference of tdma and csma .",
    "[ csmavstdma_socialwelfare_demandhh_10videousers ] shows the optimal social welfare achieved by the benevolent provider under csma and tdma .",
    "we can see that when the cost difference is low ( @xmath133 for csma and @xmath134 for tdma ) , tdma is always better in the range of email user number parameters considered .",
    "when the cost difference is high ( @xmath135 for csma and @xmath136 for tdma ) , tdma is worse initially , when it does not cover the cost to have both types in the network due to the small number of email users .",
    "similarly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ csmavstdma_profit_demandhh_10videousers ] , the profit achieved by the selfish provider under tdma is always better when the cost difference is low , and that achieved under tdma could be worse when the cost difference is high and the number of email users is small .",
