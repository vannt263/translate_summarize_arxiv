    "the magnetic tunneling junction ( mtj ) , which consists of a tunnel barrier sandwiched between two ferromagnetic electrodes , is one of the central topics in spintronics .",
    "@xcite mtjs exhibit tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ; their resistance depends on the relative magnetic configurations ( parallel or antiparallel ) . since the tmr effect was discovered by julliere ,  @xcite amorphous al@xmath1o@xmath2 has been mainly used as a tunnel barrier .",
    "@xcite however , in 2004 , large magnetoresistance ( mr ) was obtained in mtjs with a crystalline mgo barrier  @xcite supported by theoretical prediction .",

    "although most mtj studies have thus far been performed via conventional resistance measurements , noise measurements can serve to further clarify the intrinsic properties in mtjs .",
    "the noise results from the fluctuation of the current ( thermal noise and shot noise ) and of the resistance such as the @xmath0 noise and the random telegraph noise ( rtn ) . thermal noise and shot noise are due to the thermal agitation of electrons and the partition process of electrons , respectively , whereas the resistance fluctuation in mtjs is attributed to a nonmagnetic origin ( charge trap in the tunneling barrier ) and a magnetic origin ( magnetic fluctuations and domain wall motion in the free and/or fixed magnetic layers ) . shot noise offers information on the interactions and/or quantum correlations of conducting electrons .",

    "the behaviors of @xmath43 , @xmath89 , and @xmath66 are similar to each other in that they have their maxima at @xmath109 and then decrease as the bias is increased .",
    "finally , both @xmath110 and @xmath66 become almost half of their maxima at the bias at which the peak of @xmath43 disappears .",
    "figure 8(c ) shows that , although the estimated @xmath96 for rtn1 and rtn2 exhibits almost an exponential increase with the bias for their whole curves , there is a kneelike structure in the curve for rtn1 at @xmath109 .",
    "we fit @xmath96 for rtn1 to @xmath111 using the arrhenius relation and taking joule heating into account , where @xmath112 is an attempt frequency .",
    "we also assume that the activation energy @xmath83 is independent of the bias voltage and that the effective temperature @xmath113 . the solid curve in fig .",
    "8(c ) corresponds to the fitted curve , where the estimated @xmath83 and @xmath114 are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . comparing this result to the previous one ,  @xcite in which the activation energy for nonmagnetic rtn in al@xmath1o@xmath2-based mtjs was found to be @xmath117",
    ", we see that our value is much smaller .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of nonmagnetic rtn in high - quality mtjs in the low - temperature , low - bias regime .",
    "returning to the magnetic configuration dependence of the rtn , one sees that @xmath43 values for peaks a and b are enhanced at roughly symmetric positions with respect to @xmath53 [ see lower panels in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) ] .",
    "the values of @xmath43 for peaks a and b have their maxima at almost the same bias voltage , whereas the amplitude of the maximum for peak a is almost seven times as large as that of peak b. we assume that the same magnetic fluctuator contributes to these two peaks .",
    "the symmetric hysteresis loop of the free layer with respect to @xmath53 also supports this assumption ( see fig .  4 ) . here",
    ", the difference in the peak amplitude between a and b can not be accounted for by conventional joule heating .",
    "that is , because the joule heating effect is proportional to the bias current at a fixed bias voltage , this effect for peak a is only 1/3 that for peak b. these results may imply a spin - dependent heating process of a localized spin system in the free layer depending on the magnetic configurations .",
    "measured at 3  k in the p ( @xmath118 oe ) and ap ( @xmath119 oe ) configurations on sample 2 as a function of @xmath21 . the solid curve is the fitted curve between @xmath120 and 10 mv .",
    "( b ) counterpart of fig .",
    "9(a ) in the p configuration ( @xmath121 oe ) on sample 3 . ]",
    "finally , we discuss the shot noise to connect our previous work with the present one and to support further evidence of our claim made before .",
    "the frequency - independent component of the spectrum is well described by eq .",
    "@xmath6 describes how the noise deviates from the poissonian value and thus characterizes the partition process of the electron tunneling .",
    "conventional tunnel junctions exhibit @xmath7 , reflecting the poissonian process .",
    "regarding al@xmath1o@xmath2-based mtjs , after the first report of the full shot noise ( @xmath122 ) ,  @xcite reduced fano factors ranging from 0.45 to 1 were reported .",
    "@xcite this reduction can be explained by the sequential tunneling model ,  @xcite where the process of two - step tunneling through impurities within the barrier is assumed . in this theoretical model ,",
    "@xmath6 strongly depends on the asymmetry of the each tunneling and can be 0.5 to 1 .",
    "full shot noise in mgo - based mtjs was reported by guerrero _",
    "et al_. and some of the authors of the present paper in experiments where the mgo barriers were as thick as 3 and 1.5 nm , respectively .",
    "@xcite this indicates that mgo - based mtjs are free from the process through impurity sites , possibly resulting from the high quality of the crystallized mgo .",
    "later , we reported the suppression of the fano factor for the p configuration ( typically 0.91 ) with a 1.05-nm - thick mgo barrier , whereas the @xmath6 for the ap configuration is almost unitary ( typically 0.99 ) .",
    "@xcite to explain this subtle reduction of @xmath6 within the above sequential tunneling model , we have to assume a very asymmetric barrier ( 1:100 ) , which is unrealistic as the barrier of our mtj is thin .",
    "moreover , by using this model , we can not explain the magnetic configuration dependence of the reduced @xmath6 , and hence we can rule out this scenario .",
    "we note that all of the experimental results for @xmath6 values including the thick - barrier case can be explained by recent theoretical work based on a first - principles calculation .",
    "@xcite namely , the fano factor , which is reduced from 1 , is a direct consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , signaling that there are coherent channels with high transmission probabilities through the epitaxial mgo barriers .",
    "thus , our result on the shot noise gives unique evidence for coherent tunneling through a crystallized mgo barrier .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "9 the typical results of the white - noise component @xmath123 and @xmath43 at 3 k as a function of bias voltage . in fig .",
    "9(a ) , @xmath123 is nicely fitted by eq .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath124 mv . for @xmath125 mv",
    ", @xmath43 increases due to enhancement of rtn for both configurations , and , as a result , @xmath123 deviates from the fitted curve .",
    "it is noted that the effect of the @xmath0 noise on @xmath123 is negligibly small in this bias range .",
    "the above observation indicates that to accurately estimate the fano factor immune to the frequency - dependent noise , it is necessary to analyze the noise in the low - bias regime at low temperature .",
    "experimentally , we can suppress magnetic rtn by stabilizing the magnetization by applying a large magnetic field for the p configuration .",
    "in fact , in fig .",
    "9(b ) , the enhancement of rtn is suppressed , and thus @xmath123 is almost perfectly fitted by the shot - noise formula with @xmath126 .",
    "the low - frequency noise properties in submicron - sized cofeb / mgo / cofeb - based mtjs with thin tunneling barriers are systematically investigated .",
    "the measurements are carried out at low temperature by controlling the magnetic field and bias current ( voltage ) , where we focus on the noise properties on the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer . a clear correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath48 is observed .",
    "the nice scaling of the observation by the fd relation indicates that the main origin for the @xmath0 noise is thermal magnetic fluctuation of the free layer .",
    "rtn is observed inside the magnetic hysteresis loops for both configurations .",
    "we found that this is due to the magnetic fluctuation between two quasistable single - domain states with some strain in the free layer .",
    "although the @xmath0 noise is almost independent of the magnetic configuration , rtn is remarkably enhanced for the ap configuration and at specific bias voltages .",
    "such results indicate a spin - dependent activation process of rtn . shot noise measurement gives us quantitative information for coherent tunneling .",
    "our study shows that a systematic study on the noise of mtjs is possible by using devices with well - crystallized thin mgo barriers and by measuring the noise at low temperature and low bias .",
    "further study of the noise properties in mgo - based mtjs with various barrier thicknesses is necessary to systematically elucidate the mechanism of the noise and improve the device properties .",
