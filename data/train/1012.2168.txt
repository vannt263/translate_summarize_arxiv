    "the prediction of the electromagnetic structure of baryons and mesons is an important challenge for quark models and , when compared to the available experimental results , it provides a test on the relevant hadronic degrees of freedom . for baryons with spin 1/2 ( as in the baryon octet )",
    "the charge and the magnetic moment are the only multipole moments to be defined , while for baryons with spin 3/2 ( as in the baryon decuplet ) also the electric quadrupole moment exists . however , at present , there is no experimental measurement of the electric quadrupole moment for any of the baryons , although there are several model predictions for the @xmath9 and the @xmath0 , and other decuplet particles . for a summary of the @xmath9 results",
    "see refs .  @xcite . as for the @xmath0",
    "there are predictions based in quark models @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite , large-@xmath10 limit @xcite and other formalisms @xcite .    within all members of the baryon decuplet ,",
    "the @xmath0 is specially interesting .",
    "as it is composed solely by strange quarks in the valence sector , it can decay only by weak interaction and therefore its lifetime is extremely longer than the one of the other baryons .",
    "for this reason , experimentally , the @xmath0 properties are easier to be determined than the ones of any other member of the decuplet .",
    "a good illustration of this is the accuracy of the @xmath0 magnetic moment @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the nuclear magneton .",
    "it is also expected that the @xmath4 quadrupole moment will be measured in a near future @xcite .",
    "additionally , the valence quark content of the @xmath0 is restricted to strange quarks , with a mass considerably larger than the light @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark masses .",
    "as now it is already possible to perform lattice qcd at the physical strange quark mass , the @xmath0 magnetic moment @xcite , and more recently also its electric charge @xmath15 , magnetic dipole @xmath16 , electric quadrupole @xmath2 and magnetic octupole @xmath17 @xcite were calculated within lattice qcd .",
    "another important issue is that in sea quark effects for the @xmath0 only at most one single light quark participates , and therefore the pion has no role in this case . as in chiral perturbation theory loops involving mesons heavier than the pion",
    "are suppressed , the @xmath0 becomes then a special case where meson cloud corrections to the valence quark core are expected to be small .",
    "a consequence of the smallness of the meson cloud effects is that lattice qcd simulations , quenched or unquenched , should be a good approximation to @xmath0 form factors at the physical point .",
    "therefore in this work we take the lattice qcd simulations as good representations of the physical results , without any extrapolation of the lattice data to the physical pion mass .",
    "the main limitation in obtaining the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factors in lattice qcd simulations comes from these ones being restricted , for practical reasons , to finite non - zero values of @xmath1 , while the determination of the quadrupole moment , for instance , is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "an extrapolation in the momentum transfer squared @xmath1 , down to @xmath19 is then required , and one has inevitably to resort to an analytical form to do it .",
    "it is at this point that it is reasonable to expect that a quark model is useful , in particular for systems as the @xmath0 , without light valence quarks and where meson loop corrections are expected to be small .",
    "since the covariant spectator quark model was tested already for spin 1/2 baryons @xcite , spin 3/2 baryons @xcite , including strange quarks , and electromagnetic transitions between different baryon states @xcite , it is a good candidate to be used not only to interpolate between lattice qcd data in @xmath1 , but also to extrapolate the form factor data to @xmath19 .",
    "the covariant spectator quark model was applied in the past to estimate successfully the leading order form factors of the @xmath0 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) neglecting d - state admixtures @xcite . here , we extend the formalism to the case where the d - state admixture coefficients are non - zero . because these states are included , we have now contributions for the @xmath2 and @xmath17 form factors , and therefore we can use the model to extract the @xmath0 electric quadrupole moment from lattice qcd data . by adjusting some parameters associated with the @xmath0 wavefunction to the lattice data , our procedure has the advantage of incorporating into the phenomenological model the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , in its discrete version ( lattice qcd ) .",
    "the information on the wavefunction parameters allows us then to calculate all the electromagnetic form factors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath2 and @xmath17 as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the model can be used to determine the electric quadrupole form factor at the @xmath19 point .",
    "to constrain the model we use the unquenched lattice qcd data from ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 at the physical @xmath0 mass .",
    "although the existing lattice data is unquenched , the valence quarks are expected to play the main role and meson dressing to be small , as mentioned before .",
    "this is why the adjustment of the quark model to the lattice qcd data is meaningful . to better constrain the parameters of the quark model , we use also the single datapoint for @xmath17 from ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to the lattice data from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start by using the spectator formalism to represent the @xmath0 wavefunction , in a similar way to the one used before for the @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although both the @xmath9 and the @xmath0 have the same spin structure , they differ in their flavor content .",
    "therefore we begin with the su(3 ) generalization of the spectator quark model for the overall study of the baryon decuplet @xcite .",
    "also , the quark momentum distributions for the two baryons are different , and our calculation at the end quantifies this difference . as for the electromagnetic current associated with the interaction of the photon with the strange quark , which is another aspect where the calculation differs from the calculation for the @xmath9 baryon , we use the current based on vector meson dominance from ref .",
    "@xcite .    under the assumption that the d - state components are small",
    ", then we take only the electromagnetic current matrix elements which are in first order in the admixture coefficients as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath9 .",
    "finally , in the process of adjusting the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factor results to the lattice data , we determine the percentage of each d state present in the orbital quark - diquark part of the wavefunction of the @xmath0 baryon .",
    "our calculation enables us at the end to narrow the uncertainty in the extraction of the value of the quadrupole magnetic moment of the @xmath0 from the lattice qcd data .",

    "this shows that the momentum distribution in the overlap integral between s and d3 states is very different in both systems and it has to be taken into consideration .",
    "an intrinsic limitation of our calculation is the determination of the form factors only in first order of the admixture coefficients .",
    "the exact calculation of the form factors including the contributions from transitions between d states is in progress @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of these transitions can be estimated approximately by the correction implied by the deviation of the normalization constant @xmath119 from 1 . in the present case",
    "this correction is about 3.4% .    finally , in the future",
    ", a precise calculation of the magnetic octupole form factor of the @xmath0 using lattice qcd will be very useful for a better understanding of the @xmath0 electromagnetic structure .",
    "the magnetic octupole moment @xmath120 , was estimated already in refs .",
    "our result corresponds to @xmath121@xmath122 .",
    "although the experimental determination of @xmath123 may not be possible in practice , an evaluation based on qcd in a regime where meson excitations are expected to be small , may help to select models .",
    "in particular for our model , it can allow a more accurate determination of the wavefunction structure , which carry information on the shape of the electromagnetic distributions inside that baryon , and also the the relative contribution of the d - wave components in the wavefunction of the @xmath0 .",
