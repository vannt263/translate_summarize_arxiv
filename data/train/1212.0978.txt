    "simple example : locally , 4d riemannian space can be considered as a hyper - surface in the 10d euclidean space .",
    "if @xmath7 were its coordinates , then we would have    @xmath8    but now @xmath9 are a priori independent variables .",
    "now , in addition to the christoffel connection , we can write an alternative affine connection    @xmath10    with torsion      and curvature , whose final expression is simple    @xmath12    the action is    @xmath13    @xmath14 is projector onto the directions orthogonal to the four 10-vectors @xmath15 ( the `` vertical '' directions ) . varying w. r. t. @xmath15 and projecting onto the vertical directions we find      this gives    @xmath17 } = 0\\ ] ]    almost everywhere .",
    "then @xmath18 , and the action is the einstein s one .",
    "the action does not contain any of the squared derivatives @xmath19 and therefore it is finite on the discontinuous @xmath20 and @xmath21 . consider a piecewise flat ( composed of the flat 4-simplices ) manifold .",
    "it can approximate ( in the sense of curvature averaged over regions ) general smooth manifold . allowing discontinuities of the ( induced on the 3d faces )",
    "metric @xmath21 means that the 4-simplices may not coincide on their common faces , that is , be independent .",
    "also we can approximate general smooth manifold by _ independent hypercubes _ ( were these hypercubes coinciding on their 3d faces , the metric would be strongly restricted ) .    to evaluate the action for this system ,",
    "we consider @xcite the neighborhood of a triangle @xmath22 where the 4-simplices @xmath23 and their 3d faces @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are meeting , and @xmath26 are independent in these 4-simplices .    in @xmath27 the eq .",
    "@xmath28 is @xmath29 @xmath30-function with support on @xmath22 and the eq .",

    "the product of @xmath30 and @xmath32-functions is not well - defined .",
    "however , the action is unambiguous in the leading order over variation of @xmath26 from 4-simplex to 4-simplex .",
    "vice versa , the action obtained correctly reproduces the continuum one in the continuum limit , when this variation of @xmath26 tends to zero .",
    "write down cartan - weyl action for so(10 ) ,    @xmath36    excluding @xmath37 via eqs . of motion yields the einstein action",
    "@xcite . performing this operation with the following condition fulfilled ,    @xmath38    we get the faddeev action .",
    "we can generalize the above connection representation by adding the @xmath39-term to the action so that    @xmath40 } \\omega_{\\nu}^{ab } f^\\lambda_a f^\\mu_b \\sqrt{g } { { \\rm d}}^4 x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41}$ ] are lagrange multipliers at the local gauge violating condition . excluding @xmath37 via eqs . of motion yields the generalized faddeev action ,    @xmath42 { { \\rm d}}^4 x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using vertical components of the eqs . of motion",
    "we get the einstein action .",
    "it is remarkable that parameter @xmath1 , the analog of the barbero - immirzi parameter for the cartan - weyl form of the einstein general relativity , provides nonzero contribution to the faddeev action ( in contrast to the case of einstein gravity ) .",
    "to get this representation , we take 1 ) discrete connection representation for the einstein action ( that is , for regge calculus ) , now with so(10 ) connection , + 2 ) discrete form of the local gauge violating condition ( [ omega - ff ] ) . the 1 )",

    "we get einstein ( regge ) action @xcite .",
    "the form of 2 ) is straightforward ,    @xmath51    here @xmath43 is the face of the one of two 4-simplices @xmath52 containing @xmath49 and in which @xmath45 is defined .    to summarize ,",
    "the versions of the faddeev formalism considered can be continuum or discrete . besides that , these can include connection ( be of the i order ) or be purely in terms of the tetrad or edge vectors ( be of the ii order ) .",
    "we have the following correspondence between the versions of the faddeev gravity ,    @xmath53    above we have constructed the discrete connection representation considering logical transitions @xmath54 from genuine faddeev formulation @xmath55 , and then we can exclude connections via eqs . of motion , @xmath56 .",
    "then it turns out that we can reproduce the well - defined ( leading over variation of @xmath26 from 4-simplex to 4-simplex ) part of the faddeev action obtained by direct evaluation on the piecewise flat manifold , @xmath57 .",
    "that is , the diagram ( [ diagr ] ) is commutative .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec2 ] , possibility of discontinuous metrics allows to operate with the hypercube minisuperspace decomposition of spacetime instead of the more complex and inconvenient simplicial decomposition .",
    "summation over hypercubes is equivalent to summation over vertices ( sites ) .",
    "the action is    @xmath58 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{8 \\pi g \\gamma } \\sum_{\\rm sites } \\sum_{\\lambda , \\mu } \\frac{\\sqrt { ( \\epsilon^{\\lambda \\mu \\nu \\rho } f_{\\nu a } f_{\\rho b } ) ^2}}{2 } \\arcsin \\left",

    "now we assume minkowsky metric signature ( + , + , + ,  ) and @xmath63 so(d-1,1 ) .",
    "the manifold is viewed as constructed of a set of 3d leaves of similar ( here cubic ) structure labeled by a parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the difference @xmath65 for the neighboring leaves is assumed infinitesimal , and different variables are assumed to have certain orders of magnitude in @xmath65 ,    @xmath66    in particular , we can find the kinetic term @xmath67 in the resulting lagrangian @xcite ,    @xmath68 ( { \\omega^\\dagger}_\\lambda { \\dot{\\omega}}_\\lambda)^{ab } + \\dots .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the quantization of the surface area was first discussed in the continuum general relativity theory , namely , using ashtekar variables as early as in the work @xcite .",
    "there expression for the operator of the surface area requires point splitting regularization , and in order to preserve gauge invariance , this expression should be modified by introducing the path ordered exponents of the connection field operator",
    ". then evaluation of the area operator on certain set of states in the hilbert space of states ( loop states ) gives a discrete set of values .",
    "the surface area operators in terms of the _ discrete _ ashtekar type variables were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now in the discrete framework , we simply need to quantize elementary area , or the area of the 2-simplex ( triangle ) .",
    "area bivectors are canonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices .",
    "this fact leads to quantization of the elementary area in qualitative analogy with the quantization of angular momentum that is canonically conjugate to an orthogonal matrix of rotation in three - dimensional space .",
    "now we are faced with the @xmath69-dimensional angular momentum whose spectrum is well - known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we find that the elementary area spectrum is proportional to the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath1 in the faddeev gravity @xcite ,    @xmath70    with multiplicity    @xmath71",
    "the spectrum of horizon area in the loop quantum gravity ( different from the spectrum of the generic surface area in that theory ) was first used to calculate the black hole entropy in ref @xcite .",
    "the requirement that it be @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the horizon area ( bekenstein - hawking relation ) means an eq . for @xmath1 . in order to take into account the so - called holographic bound principle for the entropy of any spherical nonrotating system including black hole @xcite , in refs @xcite the formula for the spectrum of the horizon area was chosen to coincide with the general formula for the spectrum of the surface area , and corresponding value of @xmath1 found .",
    "now the elementary area spectrum obtained can be used to evaluate statistical black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "this gives eq . for @xmath1 for the different @xmath2",
    "s ,    @xmath74    calculation for , e. g. , genuine @xmath0 gives    @xmath75    if one considers _ global _",
    "embedding into external space , it may require as much as @xmath76 dimensions @xcite and then    @xmath77    the dependence on @xmath2 is rather weak .",
    "faddeev formulation allows for discontinuous metrics .",
    "thus , spacetime can be virtually composed of independent microblocks .",
    "it can be recast to the connection representation both in the continuum and discrete ( piecewise flat minisuperspace ) case .",
