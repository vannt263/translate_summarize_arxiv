    "<S> the energy flux distributions and the diffraction effect introduced by the aperture are studied and illustrated graphically . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the @xmath0-parameter and the truncation parameter on the non - paraxiality is demonstrated in detail . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the analytical formulas obtained in this paper can degenerate into un - apertured case when the truncation parameter tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this work is beneficial to strengthen the understanding of vectorial properties of the fpgb diffracted by a circular aperture </S>",
