    "neutral ( ` cold ' ) or ionized ( ` warm ' ) gaseous material is ubiquitous in the agn / smbh environment , and therefore of utmost importance in understanding the agn phenomenon , the evolution of active galaxies , their link with starburst galaxies and ulirgs , and the x - ray background .",
    "x - ray absorption and emission features provide valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in the x - ray gas and , in particular , allow to measure elemental abundances at high redshift , with profound consequences for our understanding of the star formation history in the early universe .    here",
    ", we provide a short overview of previous x - ray observations of absorption in agn , and discuss how exciting questions still open can be addressed with the _ xeus _ observatory .",
    "we apologize in advance for incompleteness in citations due to space limitations .",
    "with _ rosat _ , the signatures of warm absorbers , absorption edges of highly ionized oxygen ions at @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev , were first detected in the x - ray spectrum of mcg@xmath26 - 30 - 15 ( nandra & pounds 1992 ) , following earlier _ einstein _ evidence for highly ionized absorbing material in agn ( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "detailed studies of many other agn followed , and the signatures of warm absorbers have now been seen in about 50% of the well - studied seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , george et al .",
    "1998 ; see komossa 1999 for a review ) .",
    "first constraints placed the bulk of the ionized material outside the blr ( e.g. , mathur et al .",
    "1994 , komossa & fink 1997b ) .",
    "depending on its covering factor and location , the warm absorber may be one of the most massive components of the active nucleus .",
    "some ( but not all ) ionized absorbers were suggested to contain dust , based on otherwise contradictory optical  x - ray observations ( e.g. , brandt et al .",
    "1996 , komossa & fink 1997b , komossa & bade 1998 ) .",
    "the first possible direct detection of fe - l dust features in the x - ray spectrum of mcg@xmath26 - 30 - 15 was recently reported by lee et al .",
    "see komossa ( 1999 ) for a pre-_chandra / xmm _ review on warm absorbers .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ detected a wealth of absorption features originating from ionized gas in nearby seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , kaastra et al .",

    "; yaqoob et al .",
    "these observations confirmed the presence of ionized absorbers , but also showed that spectra are more complex than previously modeled : the ionized absorbers are often multi - component , with a range of ionization parameters and outflow velocities ( e.g. , kaastra et al . 2002 , kaspi et al . 2001 ) , and absorption - dips previously mainly attributed to oxygen edges are in some cases similarly well or better explained by fe - m absorption - line complexes ( e.g. , sako et al .",
    "2001 , behar et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the case of mgc-6 - 30 - 15",
    "a discussion has started on how much of the `` saw - tooth '' spectral structure at soft x - ray energies originates from a warm absorber ( which is independently detected by narrow absorption lines ; branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "2001 , lee et al .",
    "2001 ) , or whether it is dominated by relativistically broadened accretion - disk lines ( branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "2001 , fabian 2001 ) .",
    "[ wa ]    the presence of ionized absorbers may also be responsible for a number of x - ray phenomena in x - ray - weaker objects , where previous x - ray spectroscopy did no longer allow to resolve individual spectral features from the absorber , but the collective effect of the absorbing gas on the x - ray spectrum is still visible .",
    "we give two examples : for instance , ( i ) with _ rosat _ it was generally not possible to distinguish between black bodies and ionized absorbers to account for the very _ steep _ observed soft x - ray spectra of narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies ( komossa & fink 1997a ) .",
    "( ii ) the idea that _ variations _ of the ionized absorber in response to intrinsic luminosity variations can mimic continuum - shape variations in case of insufficient spectral resolution is an old one , and was discussed in the early days of warm - absorber studies ( e.g. , kunieda et al .",
    "more recently , it was applied to some cases of unusual variability among agn : the narrow - line seyfert1 galaxy rxj0134 - 4258 ( komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ) and the seyfert galaxy ngc3516 ( netzer et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "cold absorption plays a fundamental role in seyfert galaxies of type 2 . in this field ,",
    "the _ bepposax _ mission recently led to great progress : large x - ray absorption columns were measured in many seyfert2 and intermediate - type seyfert galaxies , including a number of compton - thick candidate sources ( e.g. , maiolino et al .",
    "1998 , guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 , bassani et al .",
    "according to bassani et al . , the mean absorption column in seyfert2 galaxies is about @xmath3 @xmath4 , while about 20 - 30% of the sources of their sample exceed @xmath5 @xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray absorption columns appear to be variable on the timescale of months to years ( e.g. , risaliti et al .",
    "interestingly , some seyfert galaxies seem to change their x - ray spectra from reflection - dominated to transmission - dominated within several years ( guainazzi et al .",
    "2002 , and ref . therein ) .",
    "for the relevance of cold absorption in the context of models for the x - ray background , see hasinger ( these proceedings ) .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ provided high - quality spectra for the nearest seyfert galaxies .",
    "the long - term goal is to obtain this information for a much larger number of objects , particularly at higher redshift .",
    "high spectral resolution and sensitivity will allow to detect even weak lines , measure line - profiles , resolve multiple components , perform line - reverberation mapping in x - rays , and obtain the velocity fields of the absorber(s ) .",
    "questions of particular interest are : how many components are warm absorbers composed of ?",
    ", what are their densities , locations , covering factors , and metal abundances ?",
    ", is the ionized material in or out of photoionization equilibrium ?",
    ", is the velocity field similar to that measured in the uv ?",
    "finally , are uv- and x - ray absorber identical ( e.g. , mathur et al .",
    "1997 , brandt et al .",
    ", what is the origin and evolution of ionized absorbers ?",
    "concerning _ dusty _ warm absorbers , dust - created metal k - shell absorption edges will be spectrally resolvable from gas - created k - shell edges for the first time .",
    "measuring dust absorption in x - rays will be a powerful new tool to determine the dust composition in other galaxies ( e.g. , komossa & bade 1998 , komossa 1999 ) .",
    "finally , all kinds of peculiar or extreme properties of agn , partly suggested to be linked to ionized absorption ( e.g. , komossa & meerscheinchen 2000 ) , can be studied with _ xeus _ observations of high resolution and sensitivity .",
    "bal quasars are characterized by broad uv absorption lines . is",
    "has been suggested that these lines arise in a flow of gas which rises vertically from a narrow range of radii from the accretion disk .",
    "the flow then bends and forms a conical wind moving radially outwards ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "variants of radiatively - driven disk - winds were explored ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 , proga et al .",
    "2000 , proga 2001 , everett et al .",
    "2002 ) . in some of these models",
    ", an x - ray absorber shields the wind downstream from soft x - rays , allowing resonant - line driving to remain effective and accelerate the outflowing bal wind up to @xmath60.1c .",
    "pre-_chandra / xmm _ detections of bal quasars in x - rays were rare .",
    "generally , bal quasars are x - ray weak , which is usually interpreted in terms of strong excess absorption ( e.g. , green et al .",
    "1995 , gallagher et al . 1999 , brinkmann et al . 1999 , brandt et al . 2000 ,",
    "wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "although _ chandra _ provided valuable new constraints on the amount of absorption towards selected bals ( e.g. , sabra & hamann 2001 , oshima et al . 2001 , gallagher et al . 2002 ) almost all data still suffer from low s / n ( typically 50 to few hundred x - ray photons detected ) .",
    "there are indications that the bal material is ionized instead of neutral .",
    "this is definitely the case for the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 which has the best - measured x - ray spectrum of any bal quasar we are aware of .",
    "a recent _ xmm - newton _ observation led to the detection of a strong absorption feature of ionized iron , interpreted as k - edge , arising from a warm absorber of high column density ( hasinger et al .",
    "2002 ; for _ chandra _ results on this quasar , just posted at astro - ph , see chartas et al .",
    "no doubt , apm 08279 + 5255 is a top target for _ xeus _ ( see also section 6 ) .",
    "one basic question related to the x - ray bal flow is : are we directly seeing the outflowing gas in x - rays , or is the x - ray absorber at rest , shielding the uv absorbing gas to ensure the line - driving remains effective even for high ionization parameters ?",
    "are uv and x - ray absorber identical ?",
    "is radiation pressure from uv lines indeed the main driving mechanism of the outflow ?",
    "what are the x - ray column densities and the corresponding mass outflow rates ? what is the geometry of the bal flow ?    of fundamental importance will be the simultaneous measurement of _ column density _ and _ outflow velocity _ of the gas .",
    "( with present x - ray missions , and as long as the x - ray spectrum is dominated by iron _ absorption edges _ it is very difficult to distinguish between dominant ionization stage and outflow velocity of the gas . )",
    "such measurements will allow to solve one majour uncertainty in bal models , mentioned above : is the ( high - column - density ) x - ray absorber outflowing with high speed , or at rest ?",
    "in fact , the high x - ray column density measured in some bals , most reliably for apm 08279 + 5255 , _ in combination with high outflow velocities _ would pose a problem for radiation - driven outflows ( see , e.g. , discussion by hamann 1998 ) and may give indications that other mechanisms are at work to drive the bal flows .",
    "the new x - ray measurements with _",
    "xeus _ will have profound implications for our understanding of massive and energetic outflows in agn , their launch and acceleration mechanism .",
    "abundance measurements will tell the history and origin of the bal gas , and its role in metal - enriching the environment . according to a recent model by elvis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , bal environments are expected to be dusty . in the x - rays regime ,",
    "absorption features from dust will provide a clean way to measure the dust composition .",
    "evidence for excess x - ray absorption was found in high - redshift , mostly radio - loud , quasars ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "1994 , schartel et al .",
    "1997 , yuan 1998 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the absorber remained largely unknown . however , there is now growing evidence that these absobers are not cold but warm . as shown by schartel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the spectrum and spectral changes of the high - redshift quasar pks2351 - 154 ( @xmath7=2.67 ) are well explained by the presence of an ionized absorber of column density @xmath8 which changes its ionization state in response to intrinsic luminosity changes of the quasar .",
    "pks2351 - 154 is one of the very few high-@xmath7 quasars which show a _ variable _ uv absorption system as well . for several years ,",
    "this quasar held the record of being the most distant x - ray warm - absorber candidate known , recently exceeded by gb1428 + 42 and pmnj0525 - 33 ( fabian et al .",
    "2001a , b ) . in contrast , yuan et al . ( 2000 ) argued that the x - ray absorber of the high - redshift quasar rxj1028.6 - 0844 is very likely cold .",
    "an interesting puzzle is , why the uv spectrum of this object does not show any signs of the x - ray cold absorber .",
    "[ ] 0.57    [ wa ]      what is the origin and nature of the high - z excess absorbers ? is this material warm or cold ? why has it been more abundant in the past ?",
    "how does it evolve ? why is excess absorption mainly seen in high - redshift radio-_loud _ quasars whereas a number of ( non - bal ) high - z radio-_quiet _ quasars appear to be absorption - free ? answers to these questions are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of agn .",
    "apart from measuring ionic column densities , a very interesting prospect is to determine element abundances in dust and gas at high redshift .",
    "this topic will be discussed in more detail in section 6 .",
    "an exciting new aspect of having access to high - resolution spectroscopy in x - rays is the search for absorption lines from the intergalactic medium .",
    "first results were recently reported by mathur et al .",
    "( weak ) ovii and oviii absorption lines in the direction of the bright quasar h1821 + 643 were interpreted as arising from a moderate density , shock - heated intergalactic medium predicted by cosmological scenarios .",

    "the long - term goal is to obtain this information for a much larger number of objects , particularly at higher redshift .",
    "we concentrate here on the aspect of deriving metal abundances at high redshift .",
    "below , we summarize open questions and how they can be addressed with the greatly improved sensitivity and resolution ( arnaud et al .",
    "1999 ) of _ xeus_.      two types of quasars show excess absorption at high redshift : radio - loud quasars on the one hand , bal quasars on the other hand .",
    "( ( interestingly , though , very few bals are radio - loud ; but whether these facts tell us something about the similar / different origin of the excess absorbers in both types of objects , is unclear . ) )    here , we will concentrate on the iron _ edge _ features which offer some valuable advantages over fe emission lines in usage as abundance indicators ( for interesting aspects of studying relativistically broadened iron _ lines _ at high redshift we refer to the _ xeus science case _ ; arnaud et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the iron absorption features and k - edges provide a unique probe of matter at high redshift because , firstly , they are easy to measure even , or , _ particularly _ , at high redshift @xmath7 , and secondly , fe(/o ) abundance measurements in the early universe are important for key issues of cosmology , as elaborated on below .",
    "the relevance of uv - feii emission in deriving fe / mg abundances at high @xmath7 was discussed by hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) and yoshii et al .",
    "in particular , yoshii et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the emission - line ratio feii / mgii to estimate the iron - to - magnesium abundance in the distant quasar qsob1422 + 231 . here , we would like to emphasize the role of the x - ray fek@xmath9 edges as one of the ` cleanest ' diagnostics of iron  of column density and ionization state in a first step , and of fe / o abundance in a second step :    * firstly , the iron absorption is easy to measure : at high redshift , the iron - k edges are redshifted to a region , where the detector sensitivity is high . as a bonus , the continuum shape is very well constrained since redshift shifts the high - energy part of the quasar spectrum into the observable band . + * absorption edges are , in principle , more reliable than emission lines because they do not depend on parameters like gas density and temperature , and provide a direct measurement of the ionic column densities .",
    "+ in addition , the iron edge is better suited than the iron k@xmath9 emission line which appears to be less common at high redshift .",
    "+ in the uv - band , no strong fe - lines are present , apart from the feii emission complexes which are still subject to high uncertainties , ( i ) in model predictions ( e.g. , the role of photo - excitation by lyman @xmath9 photons ) , and ( ii ) in measurement interpretation ( some fe may be depleted into dust , some fe may be of higher ionization state than feii , with reduced contribution to feii emission in both cases ) ; see hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) and references therein . + * the iron edges do not coincide with any other strong absorption - line transitions at the same energies ( as opposed to some low - energy features , where k - shell and l- and m - shell features of different species partly overlap ) .",
    "+ * absorbers of _ high column density _ have been observed in high - redshift quasars in x - rays , particularly in radio - loud quasars and bal quasars , so they are known to be present .",
    "a high column density is indeed required for the optical depths in the edges to become measurable .",
    "e.g. , a column density in neon - like iron of @xmath10 @xmath4 corresponds to an optical depth of @xmath11 in the absorption edge ( with cross section from verner & yakovlev 1995 ) . + * the element iron plays a special role in chemical enrichment scenarios , because its production is delayed relative to other elements ( e.g. , fig 1 of hamann & ferland 1993 ) , since it is believed to be mostly produced in supernovae of type ia ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 1984 , sect .",
    "2.1 of greggio & renzini , 1984 , sect.4.6 of hamann & ferland 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "its role as `` cosmic clock '' was therefore realized early ( e.g. , tinsley 1979 ) .",
    "hamann & ferland ( 1993 ) also pointed out its role in determining cosmological parameters : a certain age of the universe is required to produce iron in sufficient amounts .",
    "the detection of high fe abundances at high redshift would therefore point to a larger age of the universe at the same redshift , thus to a different set of cosmological parameters than an einstein - desitter universe with deceleration parameter @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "it is these last two science issues , which are of special interest . the usage of iron as a `` cosmic clock '' depends on our understanding of supernovae of type ia , which are thought to play the dominant role in the enrichment of iron relative to alpha elements . given the long lifetime of snia precursors , it takes about 0.3 - 1gyr until sn ia start to form in significant numbers ( e.g. , fig .",
    "9 of hamann & ferland 1993 ; fig .",
    "4 of matteucci 1994 ) .",
    "the iron production is delayed correspondingly ( @xmath13 1gyr ) . therefore ,",
    "even with a high rate of snia , detection of large amounts of iron in the very early universe would require another mechanism to be at work .",
    "it would most likely imply a larger age of the universe at a given redshift , to provide more time for the formation of iron ( hamann & ferland 1993 , yoshii et al .",
    "1998 ) .",

    "( 2002 ) on the bal quasar apm 08279 + 5255 at redshift @xmath7=3.91 , which shows an fe / o ratio of about 3 .",
    "such high ratios are not produced by snii / ib and imply that snia are involved .",
    "however , assuming an einstein - desitter world model with @xmath15=1.0 and @xmath16=0 , at the redshift of the quasar the universe was too young ( @xmath17 0.9gyr ; tab .",
    "1 ) to produce the observed overabundance of iron . according to models of hamann & ferland ( 1993 ; their model m4a ) a timescale of @xmath63 gyr is required to produce an abundance ratio of fe / o=3.solar .",
    "model ` m4 ' is the quasar model favored by hf93 . in several other models they studied ,",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observations of apm 08279 + 5255 therefore favor cosmological models which predict a slightly larger age of the universe _ at the redshift of the quasar _ , like recent models involving a low value of @xmath19 and a cosmological constant ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 of perlmutter et al .",

    "we will thus obtain valuable information about nucleosynthesis in the early universe , and we will be able to follow another path to measure cosmological parameters .      an important design feature of future x - ray missions , particularly those aiming at high - redshift studies , is the _ soft _ x - ray sensitivity . in order to determine metal abundance ratios of fe / o and fe / ne",
    ", it will be essential to detect oxygen and neon edges out to as high redshift as possible",
    ". the high sensitivity of _ xeus _ in its final configuration will be crucial to study iron absorption features at high redshifts , since the iron abundance is expected to decline significantly beyond a redshift @xmath20 4 , as discussed above .",
    "science issues that we will be able to address with _ xeus _ for the first time , particularly at high redshift , include : measurement of metal abundances of x - ray ( cold ) absorbers by detection of metal absorption edges , determination of the composition of dust mixed with cold and ionized gas ( k - edges of metals in cold dust and cold gas will be resolvable from each other for the first time ) , measurement of the velocity state of the gas , and usage of these results to investigate the _ evolution _ of gas and dust in agn from high to low redshift : the evolution of abundances , dust content , ionization state , amount and velocity of gas , and its role in feeding the black hole .",
