    "snte and other ii - vi materials with the rock - salt structure type have long attracted attention as models of small band gap semiconductors , and have been of renewed recent interest due to the discovery of topological crystalline insulators .",
    "@xcite hole - doped snte is also often considered a model system for superconductivity in a rock - salt type small band gap semiconductor .",
    "@xcite it is known , however , that snte shows very different superconducting t@xmath5 s when self - hole - doped ( _ i.e. _ sn@xmath6te ) , and chemically doped ( _ i.e. _ sn@xmath0in@xmath1te ) , to the same hole - densities .",
    "@xcite moreover , indium - doped snte maintains the cubic rock - salt structure type up to very high indium contents ( about 50% ) . at such high indium levels ,",
    "the sn@xmath0in@xmath1te system can no longer be considered as a doped semiconductor because , at such high _ x _ , normal charge balance rules based on sn@xmath3 , in@xmath2 and te@xmath7 are strongly violated ; _ i.e. _ for sn@xmath8in@xmath8te the in content is an order of magnitude too high for that to be a reasonable model for the system .",
    "these observations raise the fundamental question : `` what is the real nature of indium in sn@xmath0in@xmath1te ? ''    many reports on this materials system postulate that in@xmath2 replaces sn@xmath3 .",
    "this behavior has been well supported experimentally up to about a 9% indium doping level and a good correlation is found between the chemical in content and the experimentally observed hole carrier densities .",
    "@xcite ( assuming that each in@xmath2 donates one hole to the system when substituting for sn@xmath3 ) .",
    "it has also been reported that the superconducting t@xmath5 of sn@xmath0in@xmath1te continues to increase up to a very high level of doping ( 50% of in ) . unlike the case for the lower doping levels",
    ", however , there do not appear to be any reports of a correlation between in content and carrier density in this composition regime ; only t@xmath5 s and upper critical fields are presented .",
    "this therefore raises another question : \" if sn@xmath0in@xmath1te is the model system for hole - doping induced superconductivity in a rock salt structure semiconductor , then does the superconducting t@xmath5 scale with hole - density , even at high doping levels ?     to test these two questions ,",
    "we have revisited indium - doped snte .",
    "our experimental investigations have revealed unanticipated new details of the electronic behavior of the system , leading us to suggest that indium is not a trivial dopant in snte .",
    "motivated by the experiments , analysis of our electronic band structure calculations indicates that unlike the case for other monovalent dopants , the in(_s _ ) states in sn@xmath0in@xmath1te are prevalent at the fermi level , supporting a resonant - level - type model in which indium has a mixed oxidation state in the system , _",
    "i.e. _ that it has partially filled 5__s _ _ states and thus is neither in@xmath2 nor in@xmath9 .",
    "indium as a resonant level dopant has previously been proposed in snte  @xcite ( along with the analogous tl - doped pbte system  @xcite ) . here",

    "the fermi energy is less deep in the valence band , and there is a new , distinct in - gap state not seen in the other calculations . the fat bands , which allow the orbital origin of this in - gap state to be determined , show that it is due to the contributions from the in 5__s _ _ orbital .",

    "this in - gap bands cuts through the fermi energy at multiple points , and thus contributes to the electronic properties of the material .",
    "this already indicates an unusual doping mechanism .",
    "while in is creating holes in the valence band manifold , it is simultaneously creating other electron and hole pockets through the creation of an impurity band centered around e@xmath4 .",

    "[ fig6 ] shows the electronic structures for in , ag , na and vacancy doped snte at 12 percent doping . here",

    "furthermore , the same in - gap state present in the 3 percent doped calculation is present here . indeed , this band traverses the entire band gap .",
    "this compound can not be considered to be a doped semiconductor , as artificially adding electrons will not bring the fermi level into a band gap . finally , the fermi level is about the same depth in the valence band as is seen for the 3 percent in doping level .",
    "while these calculations can not be directly compared , as the 12 percent and 3 percent calculations needed different unit cell symmetries , this certainly indicates that there is a nonlinear dependence of hole concentration on indium doping level , at least at high doping levels .",
    "this is indeed what is observed experimentally .",
    "in fact , as the in impurity band is creating its own fermi surface , at high doping levels , it may not be meaningful to distinguish between different hole concentrations , as the fermi surface is now more complex than a single pocket .",
    "what is striking is that in both cases , the in dopant is creating an impurity band that is relatively well - separated from the other bulk bands , and which is also not very dispersive in energy .",
    "this is characteristic of a resonant level type dopant , as has been discussed in the thermoelectric and related literature .",
    "@xcite    the resonant aspect of this impurity state is also apparent in the density of states .",

    "the in doped compound at 3 percent has a small  doublet  peak , which sits right at e@xmath4 , that is not present in the others . at 12 percent ,",
    "this has evolved into a tall , well separated peak that is bisected by the fermi energy .",
    "further analysis show that both of these peaks have nontrivial in 5__s _ _ character , along with te 5__p _ _ character .",
    "this indicates that the impurity state that is so important in in doped snte appears to come from a hybridization of in 5__s _ _ and te 5__p _ _ orbitals .",
    "due to the inert pair effect , it is very unusual to have 5__s _ _ or 6__s _ _ states at the fermi level ( indeed , in snte the sn 5__s _ _ states appear about 5 ev below e@xmath4 ) ; some well - known compounds that do , such as k doped babio@xmath78 , exhibit superconductivity .",
    "@xcite it is therefore very likely that the hybrid state created by the in 5__s _ _ and te 5__p _ _ orbitals play a significant role in the superconductivity .",
    "this would explain why in doped snte exhibits an order of magnitude higher t@xmath79 than self - doped snte , even at the same nominal hole concentration .",
    "further calculations indicate that if in were also to occupy an interstitial tetrahedral site rather than replacing an sn atom , it would act as an _ n_-type dopant while still inducing the same in - gap 5__s _ _ state as seen in the previously discussed calculations .",
    "this calculation was part of our motivation for the detailed crystallographic study we performed , which showed that in in tetrahedral interstitial sites can not be found in ( sn , in)te .",
    "finally , we note that in has been used as dopant to achieve very high resisitivities in pb@xmath0sn@xmath1te .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of indium forming an in - gap state . at very low concentrations",
    ", this state would be relatively localized , and would pin the fermi energy to the gap , acting as a carrier concentration buffer , much like sn does in sn : bi@xmath80te@xmath80se .",
    "we have shown , through experimental observations and dft calculations , that indium doped snte can not be thought of as a simple hole doped semiconductor . the nature of the superconductivity and the carrier type change as a function of indium doping , going from overall _ p_-type to overall _ n_-type and from a weakly coupled to a strongly coupled superconductor .",
    "furthermore , the in 5__s _ _ states are shown by theory to be present at the fermi level and therefore affect the electronic properties . given that indium doped snte has been studied as a superconducting doped topological crystalline insulator , this work indicates that the nature and influence of the in 5__s _ _ states must be taken into account .",
    "this may also suggest that aside from allowing for insulating behavior or improving thermoelectric performance , resonant level dopants can affect superconducting properties .",
    "future studies could elucidate further the nature of resonant level doping in snte .",

    "<S> density functional theory calculations probing the electronic state of in in snte show that it does not act as a trivial hole dopant , but instead forms a distinct , partly filled in 5__s _ _ - te 5__p _ _ hybridized state centered around e@xmath4 , very different from what is seen for other nominal hole dopants such as na , ag , and vacant sn sites . </S>",
