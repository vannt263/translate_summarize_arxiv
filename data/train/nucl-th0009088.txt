    "in the last few years , interest for the study of phase transitions and phase coexistence in atomic nuclei has been revived @xcite in particular making use of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite . in the chart of nuclei ,",
    "three transitional regions can be distinguished where one observes rapid structural changes : ( a ) in the nd - sm - gd region , one observes a change from spherical to well - deformed nuclei when moving from the lighter to the heavier isotopes ; in the ibm language this is the @xmath1-@xmath2 transitional region ; ( b ) in the ru - pd region , one notices that the lighter isotopes are spherical while the heavier ones indicate a @xmath0-unstable character , this is the @xmath1-@xmath3 region ; ( c ) in the os - pt region , the lighter isotopes are well deformed while the heavier shown @xmath0-unstable properties , this is the @xmath2-@xmath3 transitional region .",
    "although these three transitional regions have been studied extensively in the framework of the ibm @xcite ( note that in this paper we use the simplest version of the model , ibm-1 , therefore we do not consider the transitional regions using ibm-2 @xcite ) , the discussion of phase transitions has not always been treated in a proper way . in particular one of the weak points is how to define an appropriate control parameter in a system such as the atomic nucleus where this parameter is fixed ( for given @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and can not be controlled externally @xcite .",
    "this problem has been recently considered in a study by casten _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite .",
    "binding energy ( be ) serves as an appropriate `` signature '' for phase transitions in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the nucleus or , equivalently its mass , is one of the more important nuclear properties to be determined . in some cases",
    "this is the only knowledge about a nucleus when situated far from stability . in the last few years",
    ", the development of new experimental facilities has given access to very unstable nuclei and many new mass measurements have been obtained @xcite . in the light of the variety of nuclear properties ( nuclear mass , nuclear moments , @xmath6 ) that have been obtained recently , a theoretical study concentrating on the nuclear binding energy and , related to that , possible phase transition is desirable .",
    "binding energies contain important information about nuclear structure . in ibm calculations , only spectra and electromagnetic transitions used to be analyzed and",
    "the description of the binding energy is in most of the cases excluded . in the present article",
    "we show that it is convenient to explore nuclear binding energies in order to obtain a consistent description , especially when one is dealing with chains of isotopes .",
    "it must be noted that the study of binding energies can help to discriminate between apparently equivalent descriptions of energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions rates for a given nucleus or , even for a chain of nuclei .",
    "in section [ ph - trans ] we review the study of phase transitions in the ibm . in section [ id - ph - trans ]",
    "a new way of dealing with phase transitions in nuclei will be presented together with the study of two - neutron separation energies ( s@xmath7 ) in regions where phase transition might happen . in section",
    "[ real ] we study some realistic cases and , finally , in section [ conclu ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the ibm is an algebraic model able to describe the low - lying collective states in even - even nuclei in terms of bosons which carry either angular momentum @xmath8 ( @xmath9 bosons ) or angular momentum @xmath10 ( @xmath11 bosons ) @xcite .",
    "the system of bosons , for which the number of bosons equals half the number of valence fermions , @xmath12 , interacts through a hamiltonian that typically includes up to two - body interactions , is number conserving and rotationally invariant . the original version of the model , the ibm-1 , is used in the present article .",
    "the ibm has been extensively used during the last decades for the study of medium and heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges for the model was the description of transitional regions , where the structure of the nuclei can change rapidly along a chain of isotopes .",
    "in particular , different transitional regions have been obtained where such changes in the nuclear structure appear : from spherical to well deformed nuclei ( nd , sm , and gd region ) , from well deformed to @xmath0-unstable nuclei ( ru and pd region ) or from spherical to @xmath0-unstable ( os and pt region ) . in the ibm language a spherical nucleus is related to the @xmath1 limit , a well deformed nucleus is related to the @xmath2 limit , while @xmath0-unstable nuclei correspond to the @xmath3 limit .",
    "a compact hamiltonian for analyzing the three previous regions can be depicted as follows , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficient of the one - body term can be rewritten as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the single - particle energy for the @xmath11 bosons . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath17 is the @xmath11 boson number operator and @xmath18 the symbol @xmath19 represents the scalar product . in this work the scalar product of two operators with angular momentum",
    "@xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the @xmath23 component of the operator @xmath24 .",
    "the operator @xmath25 ( where @xmath0 refers to @xmath9 and @xmath11 bosons ) is introduced to ensure the tensorial character under spatial rotations . with this hamiltonian",
    "one can explore the three transitional regions which correspond to the segments of the symmetry triangle @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking facts that happen in the transitional regions is the possibility of observation of phase transitions .",
    "a phase transition can roughly be defined as a qualitative change in a given property of a system . in order to characterize the properties of the system one has to introduce an order parameter .",
    "another important concept is the order of a transition which is the degree of the derivative for a given experimental observable which first experiences a discontinuity . in the atomic nucleus",
    "this experimental observable is the binding energy or , the related two - neutron separation energy ( s@xmath7 ) .",
    "although phase transitions are strictly well defined in macroscopic systems and the atomic nucleus is a finite system , a number of studies have shown that the concept of a phase transition retains its validity and usefulness in small systems too @xcite . a very useful tool in order to discuss phase transitions in finite system are the coherent states which , in the case of the ibm , are also known as intrinsic states @xcite . the intrinsic - state formalism provides a connection between the ibm and the geometrical collective model @xcite .",
    "the key point for establishing this connection is to consider that the dynamical behavior of the system can be described , to a first approximation , as arising from independent bosons moving in an average field @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the system is a condensate , @xmath26 , of bosons that occupy the lowest - energy phonon state @xmath27 , @xmath28 here , the variables @xmath29 and @xmath0 , that are obtained after minimization of the ground - state energy , are the order parameters of the system .",
    "a spherical nucleus will have as order parameters @xmath30 and an arbitrary value for @xmath0 ; a deformed nucleus is characterized by a finite value of @xmath29 ( in the @xmath2 limit for @xmath31 one has @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( prolate nucleus ) or @xmath34 ( oblate nucleus ) ; and a @xmath0-unstable nucleus corresponds to @xmath35 ( in the limit @xmath31 ) and to an arbitrary value for @xmath0 .",
    "a phase transition will produce changes in the order parameter of the system . using the intrinsic state",
    "we get `` microscopic '' information on the order parameter .",
    "first , we analyze the behavior of the binding energy and two - neutron separation energy in the three transitional regions . in the three cases the results are independent of the value of @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) . for the @xmath1-@xmath2 transition the value of @xmath37 varies from @xmath38 ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath39 ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath40 @xcite ; in the @xmath1-@xmath3 transition the value of @xmath37 varies from @xmath38 ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath39 ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath41 @xcite ; finally in the transition @xmath2-@xmath3 the value of @xmath42 varies from @xmath43 ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath38 ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath44 @xcite . in figures",
    "[ fig - trans - be]a , [ fig - trans - be]b , and [ fig - trans - be]c we present the binding energy in the laboratory system and in the intrinsic frame ( @xmath45 ) while in figures [ fig - trans - be]a , [ fig - trans - be]b , and [ fig - trans - be]c we present the value of @xmath29 in the three transitional regions for a number of bosons @xmath46 .",
    "first of all , it must be emphasized that the binding energy calculated in the intrinsic system is always below the exact value because it derives from a variational method .",
    "one can also realize that the intrinsic - state calculations show a sharp behavior in the phase transition regions while the diagonalization in the laboratory frame leads to smooth curves . in this sense",
    "the variational procedure mimics very well what happens in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one of the characteristics of phase transitions in macroscopic systems is that they are very sharp , but in finite system the sharpness will depend on the number of particles .    in figure [ fig - trans - be]a",
    ", a first order transition shows up ( discontinuity in the slope of the be ) , and also a discontinuity in the value of the order parameter exits . in figure",
    "[ fig - trans - be]b , a phase transition also appears , but in this case it is a second - order transition ( discontinuity in the curvature of the be ) .",
    "one observes , more generally , that there exits a line of first order transitions for hamiltonians with @xmath47 and just one point for a second - order transition in the case of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is very appropriate because the phase transition appears approximately at the same value of the control parameter ( @xmath37 ) for any value of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this critical point , @xmath48 , can be obtained easily from the expression for the energy given in @xcite as @xmath49 for @xmath50 the potential has a local minimum in @xmath30 , while for @xmath51 this local minimum becomes a local maximum .",
    "it is clear from this expression that for a large number of bosons , @xmath52 .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig - trans - be]c no phase transition appears and both calculations , exact diagonalization and intrinsic - state , lead to a smooth transitions .    in a next step ,",
    "we analyze the behavior of the two - neutron separation energy . the definition that will be used along",
    "this paper is , @xmath53 in the calculation of s@xmath7 two different nuclei are involved , which makes necessary to impose an assumption in order to relate the hamiltonians for the nuclei with @xmath4 and @xmath54 bosons . here , we consider the simplest ( not unrealistic ) case which implies the same hamiltonian in both nuclei . in figure [ fig - trans - s2n ]",
    "we study the same transitions as in figure [ fig - trans - be ] and essentially the same remarks hold . note in this case the crossing of intrinsic - state and laboratory calculations , which is allowed .",
    "so , in this section we have reviewed the study of phase transitions in atomic nuclei , in particular using the ibm , and have shown it is straightforward and clear from a theoretical point of view . in this analysis",
    ", however , there is a weak point : the control parameter @xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) is not a genuine one , because it can not be modified externally .",
    "the control parameter only changes when one is moving along a chain of nuclei and also assumes a change in the number of bosons .",
    "these two problems have already been remarked and alternative solutions have been proposed @xcite . in the next sections ,",
    "we propose a new strategy for attacking this problem .",
    "a consistent treatment of phase transitions in nuclei must go beyond the study carried out in section [ ph - trans ] because one has to treat simultaneously the control parameter @xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) and the number of bosons @xmath4 .",
    "it must be emphasized that @xmath4 is not a control parameter because it is a discrete variable and it is fixed in each individual nucleus . strictly speaking @xmath37 ( @xmath42 )",
    "is neither a genuine control parameter , because its value is also fixed in each given nucleus , nor can it be controlled externally . only the appropriate interplay of @xmath4 with @xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) can lead to a proper definition of an order parameter , although with discrete values .",
    "the appropriate way for treating phase transitions and transitional regions is to plot in the same figure the value of the binding energy versus the control parameter and this for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "in such a plot , a transition will develop through changes in the control parameter , but at the same time going through curves with a different number of bosons . in order to illustrate this new procedure",
    ", we discuss the transitional regions @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath1-@xmath3 and , @xmath2-@xmath3 in figures [ fig - be - n]a , [ fig - be - n]b , and [ fig - be - n]c respectively . in these figures ,",
    "only the laboratory results ( ibm diagonalization ) are presented .",
    "as an example , trajectories for real nuclei are also plotted in each figure . a procedure in order to obtain the value of the control parameter , for each nucleus , will be explained in section [ real ] .",
    "the more interesting cases appear in figures [ fig - be - n]a and [ fig - be - n]b because there , phase transitions indeed happen .",
    "so , looking at these figures , one can easily see if a given nucleus is situated in the spherical region ( @xmath37 near to @xmath38 ) , in the deformed region ( @xmath37 around 1 ) or at the critical point .",
    "one might be tempted to consider similar plots for the two - neutron separation energies . in this case",
    "one must be very careful because the hamiltonian for @xmath4 and @xmath54 bosons are different .",
    "that means that s@xmath7 is not a function of a single control parameter , @xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) , anymore , but becomes a function of two control parameters , one for @xmath4 and another one for @xmath54 .",
    "the essential difference between phase transitions in nuclei compared to macroscopic systems is the existence of a control parameter in the macroscopic case , such as temperature or pressure , that can be controlled externally . in the case of atomic nuclei ,",
    "the only way for changing the value of the control parameter is to move along a chain of nuclei .",
    "it is clear that the variation of the control parameter is thereby fixed and can not be modified externally .      in previous sections",
    "we have studied the behavior of the binding energy as a function of the control parameter , _",
    "i.e.  _ as a function of the hamiltonian , in the three transitional regions of the ibm . due to the specific characteristics of phase transitions in atomic nuclei , it is not _ a priori _ clear how different observables will behave when crossing a critical value through a chain of isotopes .",
    "more particular , one can observe the two - neutron separation energies as a function of the nucleus in the chain that one considers .",
    "s@xmath7 is indeed a very appropriate observable to be analyzed because it contains important information about the nuclear structure , in particular on the ground state .    before starting the present analysis we emphasize the fact that there exits an extra contribution to the binding energy not yet included when using the hamiltonian of equation ( [ ham1 ] ) , _ i.e.  _ @xmath55 those extra terms , deriving from the linear and quadratic @xmath56 casimir invariant , take into account the bulk contribution of the nuclear interaction .",
    "including those extra terms in s@xmath7 , one obtains a linear contribution to be added to the ibm calculation , resulting @xmath57 when the linear dependence is excluded from s@xmath7 , we will refer to that result as s@xmath7 .",
    "it must be noted that the specific nuclear structure ibm contribution in the three dynamical limits ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) is also linear in the boson number @xcite and in this context only a particular change in the internal structure of the nuclei , as happens during the phase transitions , can perturb this linear dependence .    in order to be sure one encounters a phase transition or passes through a specific transitional region , one has to establish the value of the control parameter for each nucleus . in the following we will concentrate on chains of isotopes ( fixed number of protons ) , being the nuclei characterized by a given number of bosons @xmath4 or by the number of neutron pairs @xmath58 . as a consequence one has to determine the functional relation @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) or , in terms of the number of neutron pairs , the relation @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "although the latter functional relation must be determined from experimental data , one can use a simple function and see if it is possible to obtain some physical insight on the structure of s@xmath7 . for the present study we fix a chain of isotopes with @xmath63 protons pairs , @xmath64 , and a variable number of neutrons pairs , ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "two functional dependences will be used , firstly linear and secondly quadratic .",
    "next , we show the different parametrizations for the different transition regions ,    * @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-@xmath3 transitional regions . @xmath67",
    "* @xmath2-@xmath3 transitional region . @xmath68    using parametrizations ( [ xi1],[xi3 ] ) , @xmath37 ranges from @xmath69 to @xmath39 . on the other hand , using parametrization ( [ chi1],[chi2 ] ) , @xmath42 ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath70 . in order to establish a realistic parametrization , we start from the empirical observation that in the @xmath1-@xmath2 transition , the system passes from the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 limit when the number of bosons is increasing @xcite .",
    "similarly , the transition @xmath1-@xmath3 implies that the system goes from @xmath1 to @xmath3 when the number of bosons is increasing .",
    "finally , the transition @xmath2-@xmath3 implies the system passes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 when the number of bosons is decreasing .    in figures [ fig - s2n - u5-su3]a and [ fig - s2n - u5-su3]b , s@xmath7 and s@xmath7 are shown , respectively , for the @xmath1-@xmath2 transitional region using for @xmath37 the parametrizations ( [ xi1],[xi3 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) has been used with @xmath71 @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "a linear dependence equal to @xmath72 has been chosen as a reference value in order to obtain a realistic behavior in s@xmath7 . in these figures ,",
    "an anomaly in the linear dependence of s@xmath7 and s@xmath7 , right at the place where the phase transition happens , can be appreciated .",
    "the phase transition point corresponds approximately to @xmath73 ( see figure [ fig - trans - be]a and [ fig - trans - be]a ) and taking into account equations ( [ xi1 ] ) and ( [ xi3 ] ) results a value for @xmath58 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the linear and quadratic dependence , respectively . we point out that in case a quadratic variation in @xmath58 for the control parameter is selected , the anomaly in s@xmath7 is more pronounced than for a linear variation . in figures [ fig - s2n - u5-o6]a and [ fig - s2n - u5-o6]b , s@xmath7 and s@xmath7",
    "are shown , respectively , for the @xmath1-@xmath3 transitional region using for @xmath37 the same parametrization as in the previous case .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) has been used with @xmath41 @xcite . in this case a linear dependence equal to @xmath76 has been used to determine the s@xmath7 values .",
    "again , a non - linear behavior appears at the point of the phase transition .",
    "the phase transition point corresponds approximately to @xmath73 ( see figure [ fig - trans - be]b and [ fig - trans - be]b ) and taking into account equations ( [ chi1 ] ) and ( [ chi2 ] ) results a value for @xmath58 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the linear and quadratic dependence , respectively . in this case , a linear variation in the control parameter leads to an almost linear dependence in s@xmath7 and s@xmath7 .",
    "only a control parameter which depends quadratically on @xmath58 produces a kink in the two - neutron separation energy .",
    "finally , in figures [ fig - s2n - su3-o6]a and [ fig - s2n - su3-o6]b , s@xmath7 and s@xmath7 are represented , respectively , for the @xmath2-@xmath3 transitional region using for @xmath42 the parametrizations ( [ chi1],[chi2 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) has been used with @xmath44 @xcite . in this case",
    "the following linear dependence @xmath72 has been chosen as a reference when calculating s@xmath7 . in this transitional region",
    "no phase transition is observed and a smooth curvature result except when one is approaching the @xmath2 limit and is using a quadratic dependence in @xmath58 for @xmath42 ( [ chi2 ] ) .    along this section",
    "we have learned to treat in a proper way binding energies ( two - neutron separation energies ) in transitional regions where phase transitions might appear .",
    "we have seen that in these regions one can get deviations from the linear tendency of s@xmath7 .",
    "next step will be to find experimental examples where those anomalies appear and explain them using the ibm .",
    "within the framework of the ibm , the energy spectra and transition rates of many medium - mass and heavy nuclei have been analyzed very successfully . however , in most of these studies @xcite the binding energies have been ignored .",
    "one of the reasons for such a neglect stems ( partly ) from the fact that the early ibm studies ( carried out in the 80 s ) @xcite gave a rather good reproduction of the general trends of the nuclear binding energy in different mass regions .",
    "so , it was tacitly assumed that realistic ibm calculations would also reproduce ( in a natural way ) the binding energy values . in the mean time , with a large increase in the precision for the mass measurement @xcite , much improved data have been established @xcite .",
    "moreover , it must be noted that , in order to carry out a proper comparison between calculated and experimental binding energies ( or @xmath77 data ) , one can not concentrate on single or a few nuclei",
    ". large chain of isotopes have to be considered and this complicates considerably performing consistent ibm calculations .    in this section",
    "we will determine the experimental relations between the control parameter @xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) and the number of neutron pairs @xmath58 through explicit fits of energy spectra for selected nuclei in the three transitional regions .",
    "starting from these relations we are able to represent a specific chain of isotopes on the diagrams shown in section [ diagr ] .",
    "we subsequently show that the experimental binding energies ( or two - neutron separation energies ) are not always well reproduced although the spectra do .",
    "we analyze chains of isotopes in the transitional regions ( i ) first using the more standard set of parameters for the hamiltonian @xcite and ( ii ) , secondly , we compare with an alternative parametrization ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we do not aim a perfect fit of the experimental data , but we intend to emphasize the influence of choosing various parametrizations on the binding energies .",
    "next we study the three transitional regions :    * there exit nuclei that exhibit a drastic change in the internal structure when one is passing their isotopes series , going from a vibrational into a rotational behavior .",
    "typical examples are situated in the rare - earth region , such as the nd , sm , and gd nuclei .",
    "the sm nuclei have been extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and a very good agreement with experimental data for s@xmath7 has been obtained . in figure",
    "[ fig - be - n]a , we plot the position of the different sm isotopes and one can clearly see how they cross the critical point , in particular @xmath78sm is situated almost exactly where the phase transition happens .",
    "the cases of nd and gd are very similar . here",
    ", we will only focus to the case of gd .",
    "+ in this region we assume a value @xmath71 because some gd isotopes clearly exhibit the character of the @xmath2 dynamical symmetry @xcite .",
    "this assumption was very successful in describing the sm nuclei , which form neighboring nuclei . with this",
    "_ ansatz _ we have carried out a fit to the energy spectra of the gd isotopes ( from @xmath79gd until @xmath80gd ) using the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) . in order to obtain the parameters , we tried to reproduce the rotational structure of the ground- and @xmath0-band as well as possible .",
    "the @xmath79gd nucleus still shows a vibrational structure while @xmath81gd are considered as rather good @xmath2 examples .",
    "the parameters for @xmath79gd to @xmath80gd , respectively , are shown in table [ tab - gd ] ( upper part ) . in figure",

    "those values are used to position the gd isotopes in the phase transition diagram of figure [ fig - be - n]a , where @xmath79gd corresponds to @xmath82 while @xmath83gd corresponds to @xmath84 . note that @xmath85gd are not plotted ; they also corresponds to @xmath44 . from figure",
    "[ fig - be - n]a one can observe a sudden transition in the gd isotopes from a vibrational regime into the @xmath2 limit . up to now , we have obtained a good description of the gd energy spectra but we have to consider the experimental two - neutron separation energies too .",

    "one observes a very bad agreement which points to the fact that the use of @xmath71 is not appropriate .",
    "a different approach to fix the hamiltonian is proposed in @xcite .",
    "there , it is assumed that in well deformed nuclei one can keep the value of @xmath87 constant around @xmath88  kev and smoothly change the values of @xmath42 and @xmath16 along a series of isotopes . in the present case ,",
    "the appropriate values for @xmath42 and @xmath87 are @xmath89 and @xmath90  kev . on the other hand the values of @xmath37 ( using @xmath15 , see equation ( [ ham1 ] ) ) are shown in table [ tab - gd ] ( lower part ) in going on @xmath91gd until @xmath80gd ( note that in this case , a few extra isotopes are also considered ) . in figure",
    "[ fig - gd - ener]b we again compare the theoretical and the experimental energies for the low - lying levels corresponding to the new hamiltonian .",

    "note that the present results for @xmath59 can not be represented in figure [ fig - be - n]a due to the new value of @xmath42 , since figure [ fig - be - n]a corresponds to @xmath71 .",

    "this region has already been studied in @xcite in the framework of the ibm-1 but using a different parametrization for the hamiltonian . due to the similarities among both series of isotopes , only the analysis of the pt nuclei",
    "will be presented here .",
    "+ in order to make a global fit we take into account the fact that @xmath108pt is one of the best examples of a @xmath0-unstable nucleus and , as a consequence , @xmath41 and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the obtained parameters @xmath110 for @xmath111pt until @xmath108pt are shown in table [ tab - pt ] ( upper part ) . in figure",
    "[ fig - pt - ener]a we compare the theoretical and the experimental low - lying levels for these parameters . if one places these values in figure [ fig - be - n]c , where @xmath108pt corresponds to @xmath112 while @xmath111pt corresponds to @xmath84 , it is clear that the pt isotopes always stay very close to the @xmath3 limit .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig - s2n - pt ] , we compare the theoretical and experimental s@xmath7 values ( this calculation corresponds to _ theo .- a _ ) , with a linear contribution @xmath113 ( mev ) as a background . again , we obtain a poor agreement in the description of the experimental values . in order to treat this mass region with a slightly different hamiltonian , one can follow again ref .  @xcite .",
    "there , it is suggested to include a single - particle energy term . in the case of the pt nuclei the more appropriate value is @xmath114  kev .",
    "the value of @xmath87 is also fixed to @xmath115  kev and @xmath116  kev .",
    "the different values of the parameters in the hamiltonian for @xmath111pt until @xmath108pt are shown in table [ tab - pt ] ( lower part ) . in figure",
    "[ fig - pt - ener]b we know compare the theoretical and the experimental low - lying levels for the new hamiltonian . using this new parametrization , when comparing the s@xmath7 values ( this calculation corresponds to _ theo .- b _ ) , with a linear contribution @xmath117 ( mev ) as a background , a good agreement is obtained as can be seen in figure [ fig - s2n - pt ] .",
    "these new results can not be represented in figure [ fig - be - n]c because now @xmath118 .    in this section",
    "we have presented two different parameter sets obtained from fitting the energies of the low - lying states of different isotopes of gd , pd , and pt . a very striking fact is , on one side , the good description of the energy spectra for both sets of parameters , and on the other side , the very different results obtained for the two - neutron separation energy using these different parametrizations .",
    "the results obtained here were totally unexpected because it was assumed tacitly that a good description of energy spectra would imply a good description for the binding energies too . in order to illustrate this problem",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath119sm which has been studied by different authors @xcite .",
    "although in all the cases the description of the energy spectrum is satisfactory , when calculating the binding energy for the proposed hamiltonians , one obtains the results @xmath120  mev ( ref  @xcite ) , @xmath121  mev ( ref  @xcite ) and @xmath122  mev ( also in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "all this suggests that a consistent study of atomic nuclei , within the ibm , requires the inclusion of an analysis of the binding energy .",
    "in the present article , we have analyzed transitional regions and phase transitions in the framework of the ibm . a new kind of diagram ( see figure [ fig - be - n ] ) for dealing with phase transitions has been presented . in this diagram",
    "we plot the binding energy of the system versus the control parameter ( hamiltonian ) for a range in the number of bosons .",
    "this procedure turns out to be a particularly convenient method when working in finite systems without a true control parameter .",
    "the main conclusions are twofold :    \\(i ) we have shown that , although the crossing through the phase transition points produces a deviation in the s@xmath7 values from the overall linear background dependence , the way in which , in the given chain of isotopes , this critical point is crossed proves extremely important in deriving clear - cut results . if _ e.g.  _ the relation between a control parameter and the isotope location ( _ e.g .",
    "_ boson number ) is linear , one does not observe dramatic changes in s@xmath7 in any of the three transitional regions ( @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath1-@xmath3 , and @xmath2-@xmath3 ) . on the contrary , for a quadratic relation",
    ", clear changes can appear in the s@xmath7 behavior at the crossing point .",
    "\\(ii ) we have observed that in a consistent study of long chains of isotopes , one has to treat the ground - state ( through its binding energy ) on equal level with the excited states ( relative energy spectrum ) .",
    "it turns out that parameters producing very similar energy spectra can still result in important differences in the ground - state binding energy ( order of @xmath39 mev ) .",
