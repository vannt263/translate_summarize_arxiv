    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is scheduled to begin operation in 2007 , beginning a new era wherein the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation will be revealed and studied in great detail . although alternative mechanisms exist in theory , this is generally believed to be a light higgs boson with mass @xmath3  gev  @xcite . more specifically , we expect a fundamental scalar sector which undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking as the result of a potential which acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "the lhc will easily find a light standard model ( sm ) higgs boson with very moderate luminosity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lhc will have significant capability to determine many of its properties  @xcite , such as its fermionic and bosonic decay modes and couplings  @xcite , including invisible decays  @xcite and possibly even rare decays to second generation fermions  @xcite .",
    "linear collider with a center of mass energy of 350  gev or more can significantly improve these preliminary measurements , in some cases by an order of magnitude in precision , if an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath4 can be achieved  @xcite . ]    starting from the requirement that the higgs boson has to restore unitarity of weak boson scattering at high energies in the sm  @xcite , perhaps the most important measurement after a higgs boson discovery is of the higgs potential itself , which requires measurement of the trilinear and quartic higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "only multiple higgs boson production can probe these directly  @xcite .",
    "recent literature is replete with self - coupling measurement studies .",
    "there are numerous quantitative sensitivity limit analyses of higgs boson pair production in @xmath5 collisions ranging from 500  gev to 3  tev center of mass energies  @xcite .",
    "for example , one neural net - based study concludes that a 500  gev linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath4  @xcite could measure the trilinear higgs coupling @xmath6 for @xmath7  gev , where @xmath8 decays dominate , at the @xmath9 level .",
    "however , none of these analyses addressed the case of @xmath10  gev , where the higgs boson mostly decays into @xmath11 bosons .",
    "studies exploring the potential of the lhc , a luminosity - upgraded lhc ( slhc ) with roughly ten times the amount of data expected in the first run , and a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) , have come only very recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies investigated higgs pair production via gluon fusion with subsequent decay to same - sign dileptons and three leptons via @xmath11 bosons , and cover the broader range @xmath12  gev .",
    "they established that future hadron machines can probe the higgs potential for @xmath13  gev . at the lhc , an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath4 provides for exclusion of vanishing @xmath6 at the @xmath14 confidence level or better over the entire range @xmath15  gev .",
    "a vlhc would provide for precision measurement over much of this mass range , similar to or better than the limits achievable at a 3  tev @xmath5 collider with 5  ab@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , we previously concluded that hadron colliders could not probe the mass region @xmath16  gev sufficiently well to be meaningful  @xcite .",
    "we reexamine that conclusion in this paper , utilizing rare decay modes in higgs boson pair production for @xmath16  gev at future hadron colliders .",
    "we first review the definition of the higgs boson self - couplings and briefly discuss sm and non - sm predictions for these parameters in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "an overview of the rare higgs decay modes in the sm ( predominantly @xmath17 final states ) and our analyses of these channels appears in sec .  [",
    "sec : lhc ] .",
    "we consider the lhc , slhc and a vlhc , which we assume to be a @xmath18 collider operating at 200  tev with a luminosity of @xmath19  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mssm ] we establish the prospects of observing a pair of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) higgs bosons in the @xmath17 and @xmath20 decay channels .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the trilinear and quartic higgs boson couplings @xmath6 and @xmath21 are defined through the potential @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the physical higgs field , @xmath24 is the vacuum expectation value , and @xmath25 is the fermi constant . in the sm the self couplings are @xmath26 regarding the sm as an effective theory , the higgs boson self - couplings @xmath6 and @xmath21 are _ per se _ free parameters , and @xmath27-matrix unitarity constrains @xmath21 to @xmath28  @xcite . since future collider experiments likely can not probe @xmath21 , we concentrate on the trilinear coupling @xmath6 in the following",
    ". the quartic higgs coupling does not affect the higgs pair production processes we consider .    in the sm , radiative corrections decrease @xmath6 by @xmath29 for @xmath30  gev  @xcite .",
    "larger deviations are possible in scenarios beyond the sm . for example , in two higgs doublet models where the lightest higgs boson is forced to have sm like couplings to vector bosons , quantum corrections may increase the trilinear higgs boson coupling by up to @xmath31  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "loop corrections modify the self - coupling of the lightest higgs boson in the decoupling limit , which has sm - like couplings , by up to @xmath32 for light stop squarks  @xcite .",
    "anomalous higgs boson self - couplings also appear in various other scenarios beyond the sm , such as models with a composite higgs boson  @xcite , or in little higgs models  @xcite . in many cases",
    ", the anomalous higgs boson self - couplings can be parameterized in terms of higher dimensional operators which are induced by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "a systematic analysis of higgs boson self - couplings in a higher dimensional operator approach can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "at lhc energies , inclusive higgs boson pair production is dominated by gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "other processes , such as weak boson fusion , @xmath33  @xcite , associated production with heavy gauge bosons , @xmath34  @xcite , or associated production with top quark pairs , @xmath35  @xcite , yield cross sections which are factors of 1030 smaller than that for @xmath36  @xcite . since @xmath37 production at the lhc is generally rate limited , we consider only the gluon fusion process .",
    "because the total @xmath36 cross section at both the lhc and vlhc is quite small , at most one higgs boson undergoing rare decay will allow for a reasonable number of events to work with .",
    "we therefore consider only final states containing one @xmath38-quark pair , which is the dominant sm higgs boson decay mode for @xmath39  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : brs ] .",
    "our previous study demonstrated that at both lhc and vlhc , @xmath40 and @xmath41 final states are overwhelmed by backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "while the backgrounds are more moderate for the @xmath42-channel , the observable part of this decay mode unfortunately has multiple additional small branching ratios , and the detectors have rather low efficiency to identify the @xmath42-leptons . as charm quarks are even more difficult to tag than @xmath38-quarks , and the qcd backgrounds become much larger due to similarly less fake - tag rejection , we can immediately discount any colored final states for the rare decay .",
    "weak boson pairs certainly qualify as rare decays in this mass region , but can not be used : the @xmath43 and @xmath44 final states suffer from a huge qcd top pair background .",
    "similarly for @xmath45 with one or more hadronically decaying @xmath46 bosons , and @xmath47 , qcd processes with the same final states are likely to overwhelm the signal ( here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote off - shell @xmath11 and @xmath46 bosons ) .",
    "the @xmath50  leptons and @xmath51 channels suffer from too low a rate , due to the small @xmath52 branching ratio .",

    "we include minimal detector effects by gaussian smearing of the parton momenta according to atlas expectations  @xcite , and take into account energy loss in the @xmath38-jets via a parameterized function .",
    "we assume a @xmath38-tagging efficiency of @xmath57 for all hadron colliders .",
    "in addition , we include an efficiency of @xmath58  @xcite for capturing the @xmath8 decay of the signal in its 40  gev mass bin .",
    "we calculate all background processes using madgraph  @xcite except where otherwise noted , and retain a finite @xmath59-quark mass of 4.6(1.7 )  gev where relevant .",
    "other detector efficiencies are given in the subsections relevant to the respective channels .",
    "we perform the signal calculation , @xmath60 , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , including the effects of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections via a multiplicative factor @xmath61 at lhc(vlhc ) energies  @xcite , using factorization and renormalization scales choices of @xmath62 .",
    "there is little scale variation left at nlo .",
    "we use exact matrix elements to incorporate the @xmath8 and @xmath63 decays .",
    "the basic kinematic acceptance cuts for events at the ( s)lhc and vlhc are : @xmath64 which are motivated first by requirements that the events can pass the atlas and cms triggers with high efficiency  @xcite , and that the @xmath38-quark and photon pairs reconstruct to windows around the known higgs boson mass , adjusted for an expected capture efficiency of @xmath58 each  @xcite .",
    "we take the identification efficiency for each photon to be @xmath65 at all machines considered  @xcite .    as in the @xmath66 signal case  @xcite",
    ", we will later try to determine the higgs boson self - coupling from the shape of the invariant mass of the final state .",
    "for that reason we do not apply any cuts which make use of the fact that the signal involves two heavy massive particles produced in a fairly narrow range of the @xmath17 invariant mass .",
    "the only irreducible background processes are qcd @xmath17 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 production .",

    "table  [ rejfac ] summarizes the expected rejection factors for charm and light jets to be misidentified as @xmath38-jets and photons , as well as the expected photon and muon identification efficiencies .",
    "the probability to misidentify a light jet as a @xmath38-jet is significantly higher at the slhc due to the high - luminosity environment  @xcite .",
    "the value quoted in table  [ rejfac ] for @xmath79 at the lhc is likely to be conservative ; recent studies  @xcite using three dimensional @xmath38-tagging have found a light jet rejection factor about a factor two better .",
    "expectations for the probability to misidentify a light jet as a photon at the lhc vary considerably  @xcite , so we perform two analyses , one conservative and the other optimistic , to cover this range .",
    "since their design luminosities are similar , it is reasonable to assume that the rejection factors for light quarks and charm quarks , and the jet - photon misidentification probabilities , are similar for the lhc and the vlhc .",
    "studies of how the high luminosity environment of the slhc affects @xmath80 and @xmath81 have not yet been performed . in lieu of better estimates",
    "we therefore use the same values as for the lhc and vlhc .",

    ".    it may be possible to subtract large parts of the reducible backgrounds which do not involve charm quarks using the following technique . due to the their large cross sections ( see tables  [ tab : xsec.l ] and  [ tab : xsec.v ] ) , one can fairly accurately determine the @xmath88 distributions of the individual processes , @xmath77 , @xmath89 , @xmath73 , @xmath72 , @xmath90 and @xmath76 production , imposing the same cuts as in the @xmath91 analysis ( eqs .",

    "if the photon  jet and light jet@xmath38 misidentification probabilities are independently measured in other processes such as prompt photon  @xcite and @xmath92  jets production , one can simply subtract these backgrounds .",
    "for the background processes involving charm quarks , on the other hand , this procedure will be more difficult to realize , since the smaller charm quark mass and the shorter charm lifetime result in a charm quark tagging efficiency much lower than that for @xmath38-quarks .",

    "list the limits achievable if the non - charm reducible contributions to the background were subtracted with @xmath31 efficiency , but none of the charm quark backgrounds could be reduced .",

    "the bounds achievable at the slhc ( vlhc ) by analyzing @xmath17 production are a factor  2.5 ",
    "6 ( 2   3 ) more stringent than those from the @xmath95 channel  @xcite .    due to the small number of events , the lhc and slhc sensitivity limits depend significantly on the sm cross section normalization uncertainty .",
    "for example , for a normalization uncertainty of @xmath96 on the sm signal plus background rate , the achievable bounds on @xmath93 are almost a factor  2 weaker than those obtained for a normalization uncertainty of @xmath97 .",
    "this sm cross section normalization uncertainty depends critically on knowledge of the qcd corrections to the signal and the ability to determine the background normalization .",

    "required precision on differential cross sections we would need the nlo rates for finite top quark masses , as well as the nnlo corrections in the heavy top quark mass limit .",
    "for the background normalization one can rely on either calculations of the qcd corrections or data . as mentioned before ,",
    "none of these nlo background calculations are available .",
    "since there are many processes contributing to the background , and most of them involve hundreds of feynman diagrams already at tree level , nlo calculations appear feasible only if automated one - loop qcd tools become available in the next few years . in the absence of such nlo results ,",

    "this technique should make it possible to determine the background normalization to about @xmath97 at the lhc and slhc , and to about @xmath104 at the vlhc .",
    "both methods rely on monte carlo simulation to correctly predict the @xmath88 distribution shape .",
    "the bounds listed in table  [ tab : sum ] should be compared with those achievable at @xmath5 linear colliders .",

    "for @xmath107  gev , the @xmath108 branching ratio and the @xmath109 cross section both fall off quickly .",
    "since the background cross section decreases only slightly , @xmath110 , and thus the bounds on @xmath6 obtainable from @xmath109 , worsen rapidly with increasing values of @xmath62 . by @xmath87",
    "gev they are at only the @xmath111 level  @xcite . from table  [ tab : sum ] it is clear that the lhc will be able to provide only a first rough measurement of the higgs self - coupling for @xmath7  gev .",

    "in contrast , the sensitivity at a vlhc will approach this level of precision .",
    "it should be noted that if the sm cross section normalization uncertainty could be reduced to a few percent , a vlhc could reach precision similar to that foreseen for clic  @xcite ( @xmath5 collisions at 3  tev center - of - mass energy ) .",
    "the @xmath20 signal calculation proceeds as in the @xmath17 case .",
    "the basic kinematic acceptance cuts for events at the lhc and vlhc are : @xmath112 where again the muon invariant mass window is chosen to accept @xmath58 of the @xmath113 decay after detector effects . the signal cross section at the lhc ( vlhc ) for @xmath7  gev before taking into account any efficiencies",
    "is 2.4  ab ( 0.21  fb ) , approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath17 channel . for larger higgs boson masses the ratio is even smaller , due to the @xmath113 branching ratio , which decreases much more rapidly with @xmath62 than that for @xmath63 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : brs ] ) .",
    "once efficiencies are taken into account , we expect less than one signal event at the lhc .",
    "the slhc would see 2   3 signal events for @xmath7  gev if one assumes that both @xmath38-quarks are tagged , too few for a meaningful coupling extraction . at a vlhc",
    "there would be about 60 signal events for an integrated luminosity of 600  fb@xmath4 , single @xmath38-tag requirement , and the same value of @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the vlhc in the following , and require only one @xmath38-tag .",
    "a potential advantage of the @xmath20 final state is the smaller number of processes contributing to the background .",
    "the main contributions to the background originate from qcd @xmath20 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 production , where the @xmath116 pair originates from an off - shell @xmath46-boson or photon . in the latter two processes , either a charm quark or light jet",

    "we calculate the background processes at lo using mcfm  @xcite and find that their sum is more than a factor  200 larger than the signal . the signal to background ratio improves by a factor  5 if we additionally require @xmath117 whereas the signal cross section falls by only about @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath77 background is negligible compared with @xmath115 .",

    "if instead both @xmath38-jets are tagged , the signal to background ratio improves by an additional factor  2 . however , the signal cross section is reduced by a factor  3 , which yields sensitivity bounds for @xmath93 which are somewhat weaker than those obtained from single @xmath38-tag data .    shrinking the @xmath116 invariant mass window could also reduce the background .",

    "the cms detector  @xcite likely can use a smaller window , @xmath120  gev , which would reduce the background by approximately a factor  1.7 .",

    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] ) , force the differential cross section to vanish for @xmath173  gev . pair production of light supersymmetric higgs bosons will thus be unobservable for @xmath174  gev .",
    "when taking into account detection efficiencies , we find that @xmath169 production at the lhc should be observable at the @xmath175 level for @xmath176  gev ( @xmath177  gev ) for an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath4 ( 600  fb@xmath4 ) and @xmath152",
    ". the signal would be rather spectacular : due to @xmath178-channel @xmath154 exchange , the differential cross section peaks for @xmath179 , as shown in fig  [ fig : mvis - susy ] .",
    "compared to the sm case the cross section is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude in the resonance region , where it depends on the @xmath180 and @xmath181 couplings . since mssm heavy scalar @xmath154 production with decay into fermions is unobservable at the lhc in the small @xmath2 region , this implies that @xmath169 production can measure only a combination of @xmath182 and the @xmath181 couplings , but not the individual couplings .     the visible invariant mass distribution , @xmath88 , for mssm light scalar higgs pair production at the lhc , @xmath183 , for @xmath152 .",
    "the light higgs mass for @xmath184  gev is 120.8  gev and for @xmath185  gev it is 122.2  gev . for comparison , we also show the distribution for sm higgs pair production ( @xmath7  gev).,width=415 ]",
    "after discovery of an elementary higgs boson and tests of its fermionic and gauge boson couplings , experimental evidence that the shape of the higgs potential has the form required for electroweak symmetry breaking will complete the proof that fermion and weak boson masses are generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking . one must determine the higgs self - coupling to probe the shape of the higgs potential .",
    "only higgs boson pair production at colliders can accomplish this .",
    "numerous studies  @xcite have established that future @xmath5 machines can measure @xmath6 at the @xmath186 level for @xmath16  gev .",
    "very recent studies  @xcite determined that the prospects at hadron colliders for @xmath15  gev are similarly positive , but that the @xmath16  gev region would be very difficult to access  @xcite .",
    "we have tried to rectify the situation in this paper by considering highly efficient , lower - background rare decay modes : @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "the latter suffers from very low rate and considerable background from the breit - wigner tail of @xmath187 production , and does not appear to be useful .",
    "this is not surprising upon comparison to our @xmath41 study  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath17 channel shows considerable promise . imposing photon ",
    "photon and photon@xmath38 separation cuts could result in a signal to background ratio of @xmath188 or better .",
    "since the irreducible qcd @xmath17 background is small compared to the reducible background originating from light jets or charm quarks mistagged as @xmath38-quarks , or from jets misidentified as photons , the signal to background ratio depends on the particle misidentification probabilities , and the required number of @xmath38-tags .",
    "we find that the lhc , with an integrated luminosity of 600  fb@xmath4 or more , could make a very rough first measurement for @xmath7  gev ( with @xmath189 signal events ) , but would not obtain useful limits for @xmath87  gev at all due to the lack of signal events .",
    "it would require a luminosity - upgraded run ( slhc , 6000  fb@xmath4 ) to rule out @xmath190 at the @xmath86 cl for @xmath7  gev , and to make a @xmath191 measurement at the @xmath126 level .",
    "a 200  tev vlhc , in contrast , would make possible a @xmath192 measurement of @xmath6 , competitive with future @xmath5 collider capabilities .",
    "we note , however , that current understanding of hadron collider higgs boson phenomenology does nt provide for the necessary precision knowledge of higgs branching ratios to complement this .",
    "it is likely that an @xmath5 collider would still be required to fill this role .",
    "although a luminosity - upgraded lhc can not compete with a linear collider for higgs masses @xmath16  gev , a higgs self - coupling measurement at the slhc will still be interesting if realized before a linear collider begins operation .    to fully exploit future hadron collider potential to measure the higgs self - coupling , we need an accurate prediction of the sm @xmath17 rate .",
    "it is mandatory that the residual theoretical cross section uncertainty be reduced to the @xmath193 level for any @xmath37 analysis to be meaningful .",
    "we will need similar precision on background rates probably from experiment by extrapolating from background - dominated phase space regions to that of the signal .",
    "probably the most exciting result of this analysis is the mssm case : the heavy mssm higgs scalar can decay into two light higgs bosons if @xmath159 .",
    "this region of parameter space poses a serious challenge to the lhc , because none of the usual heavy higgs searches will detect a hint of the two higgs doublets required in the mssm .",
    "resonant production of the heavy scalar higgs in gluon fusion and its subsequent decay into light higgs bosons , which then decay to @xmath17 , has two effects on the cross section as compared to the sm case : the total rate is enhanced by about an order of magnitude and the @xmath169 invariant mass peaks at the heavy higgs mass .",
    "even though our analysis is not at all optimized for resonant mssm production , we find a @xmath175 discovery region for @xmath152 and @xmath194  gev at the lhc .",
    "even though the discovery reach of this channel does not extend to much larger values of @xmath2 it still ensures the observation of one heavy higgs boson in a region preferred by bottom ",
    "tau unification , inaccessible by other mssm higgs searches .",
