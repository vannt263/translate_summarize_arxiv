    "there are several good reasons for considering a geometrization of quantum mechanics , as it has been beautifully illustrated in a paper by ashtekar and shilling @xcite ; consider also the partial list of papers @xcite , where a geometric formulation of quantum mechanics has been developed . perhaps , the most appealing reason is provided by the opportunity of making available the whole experience of ` classical ' methods in the study of quantum mechanical problems . here we shall focus on some recently established results of the geometrization program of quantum mechanics concerning the study of particular problems of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "+ to be more specific , let us comment on what we mean by geometrization of quantum mechanics : to replace the usual hilbert space picture with a description in terms of hilbert manifolds , together with all natural implications of this alternative description .",
    "+ in this respect , this proposal is very much similar to the transition from special to general relativity : space - time is considered to be a lorentzian manifold and the properties of the minkowski space time are transferred to the tangent space at each point of the space - time manifold .",
    "in particular , we go from the scalar product @xmath0 to the lorentzian metric tensor field @xmath1 , which is further generalized to non - flat space - time manifolds in the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are general 1-forms which carry the information on the non - vanishing of the curvature tensor .",
    "+ similarly , in the geometrization of quantum mechanics we go from the scalar product @xmath4 on the hilbert space @xmath5 to the hermitian tensor field on the hilbert manifold , written as @xmath6",
    ". this would be the associated covariant ( 0 , 2)-tensor field .",
    "+ if we consider as starting carrier space not @xmath5 itself but its dual @xmath7  say not ket - vectors but bra - vectors , in dirac s notation  we will obtain a ( 2,0)-tensor field , i.e. , a contra - variant tensor field .",
    "once we consider these replacements , algebraic structures will be associated with tensorial structures , and we have to take into account that there will be no more invertible linear transformations but just diffeomorphisms .",
    "the linear structure will emerge only at the level of the tangent space and will ` reappear ' on the manifold carrier space as a choice of each observer @xcite . +",
    "we must stress that manifold descriptions appear in a natural way already in the standard approach in terms of hilbert spaces when , due to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics , we realize that pure states are not vectors in @xmath5 but , rather , equivalence classes of vectors , i.e. , _ rays_. the set of rays , say @xmath8 , is the complex projective space associated with @xmath5 .",
    "it is not linear and carries a manifold structure with the tangent space at each point @xmath9 $ ] as ` model space ' .",
    "this space may be identified with the hilbert subspace of vectors orthogonal to @xmath10 .",
    "other examples of ` natural manifolds of quantum states ' are provided by the set of density states which do not allow for linear combinations but only convex combinations .",
    "they contain submanifolds of density states with fixed rank .",
    "+ the best known example of a manifold of quantum states is provided by the coherent states or any generalized variant @xcite , including also non - linear coherent states @xcite . as is well known ,",
    "these manifolds of quantum states allow us to describe many properties of the system we are considering by means of finite dimensional smooth manifolds .",
    "+ in this contribution , we start by reviewing , in section [ geo of h ] , the geometrical formulation of the hilbert space picture .",
    "we shall focus attention on the identification of tensor fields on submanifolds in terms of a natural pull - back procedure as considered in @xcite .",
    "this procedure is applied , in section [ app ] , by taking account the pull - back on the locally unitarily related quantum states .",
    "we then discuss some of its direct consequences for entanglement characterization according to @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we relate this tensor fields to the concept of invariant operator valued tensor fields ( iovts ) on lie groups @xcite , which naturally admit also applications in the general case of mixed quantum states . in section [ qimetrics ] , we review a recently considered connection between the pull - back of the fubini - study - metric and a quantum version of the fisher information metric @xcite .",
    "we conclude , in section [ outlook ] , by outlining a relation between iovts and the fisher quantum information metric .",
    "consider a separable complex hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "a geometrization of this space may be described in two steps as follows .",
    "first , by replacing the complex vector space structure with a real manifold @xmath11 , and second , by identifying tensor fields on the latter manifold which are associated with all additional structures being defined on the ` initial ' hilbert space , provided by the complex structure , a hermitian inner product @xmath12 , hermitian operators and associated symmetric and anti - symmetric products .",
    "moreover , we ll be interested to focus on geometric structures on @xmath11 being defined as pull - back structures from the associated projective hilbert space of complex rays @xmath8 .",
    "+ in what follows , our statements should be considered to be always mathematically well defined whenever the hilbert space we intend to geometrize is finite dimensional .",
    "indeed , the basic ideas coming along the geometric approach in the finite dimensional case are fundamental for approaching the infinite dimensional case .",
    "the additional technicalities which may be required in the latter case will be discussed here by underlining them within specific examples rather than by focusing on general claims ( for the manifold point of view for infinite dimensional vector spaces see @xcite ) .",
    "let us start with the identification of tensor fields of order zero . given a hermitian operator @xmath13 defined on a hilbert space @xmath5",
    ", we shall find a real symmetric function f_a ( ) : = @xmath14,on @xmath5 and on @xmath11 respectively .",
    "these functions decompose into _ elementary quadratic functions _ f_p_j ( ) = @xmath15,on @xmath11 by virtue of a spectral decomposition a=",
    "_ j_j p_jassociated with a family of projectors @xmath16 and an orthonormal basis @xmath17 on @xmath5 .",
    "this may be illustrated by taking into account _ coordinate functions _",
    "@xmath18:= z^j ( ) .",
    "yielding f_a ( ) = _ j _ j f_p_j()=_j _ j|z^j|^2().in this regard we may recover the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operators at the level of a related function e_a():=on the punctured hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "it is simple to see that eigenvectors are critical points @xmath20 of the function @xmath21 , i.e. de_a(_*)=0 hence , e_a ( _ * ) .by virtue of the momentum map : _ 0 u^ * ( ) , @xmath22 _ : = [ m - map ] we note that e_a()= _ ( a),_d^1 ( ) identifies a pull - back function from the set @xmath23 of normalized rank-1 projectors which are in 1-to-1 correspondence with pure physical states in @xmath8 .",
    "hence , @xmath21 is the pull - back of a function which lives on @xmath8 .      on this point we shall underline that the momentum map @xmath24 , as written within the commutative diagram @xmath25 provides a fundamental tool for pulling back , in a _ computable _ way , any covariant structure defined on @xmath26 to the ` initial ' punctured hilbert space @xmath27 . for this purpose",
    ", we may consider for a given hermitian operator @xmath28 , the operator - valued differential @xmath29 in respect to a real parametrization of @xmath30 , and define the @xmath31-tensor field ( a da da ) .",
    "the differential calculus on a submanifold @xmath32 , may then inherited from the ` ambient space ' @xmath30 together with this covariant structure . in particular for @xmath33 we find by taking into account the momentum map ( [ m - map ] ) , ( _ d_d _ ) = - , as momentum - map induced pull - back tensor field on the associated punctured hilbert space @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "moreover , this tensor - field turns out to be identified as a pull - back of the fubini - study metric tensor field from the space of rays @xmath8 .",
    "here we shall note that @xmath34 defines a @xmath5-vector - valued 1-form which provides a ` classical ' @xmath35-valued 1-form according to @xmath36 , as we shall explain more in detail in the next section .      by introducing an orthonormal basis @xmath37",
    ", we may define coordinate functions on @xmath5 by setting @xmath18 = z^j ( ) , which we ll write in the following simply as @xmath38 .",
    "correspondently , for the dual basis @xmath39 we find coordinate functions @xmath40=    product we can identify in the finite dimensional case @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "this provides two possibilities : the scalar product @xmath4 gives rise to a covariant hermitian ( 0 , 2)-metric tensor on @xmath5 @xmath41 = _ j @xmath42@xmath43= d|z_jdz^j , where we have used @xmath44 , i.e. , the chosen basis is not ` varied ' , or to a contra - variant ( 2,0 ) tensor @xmath45 = on @xmath7 .",
    "+   + _ remark : _ specifically , we assume that an orthonormal basis has been selected once and it does not depend on the base point .",
    "+   + by introducing real coordinates , say z^j ( ) = x^j()+iy^j ( ) one finds @xmath46 thus the hermitian tensor decomposes into an euclidean metric ( more generally a riemannian tensor ) and a symplectic form .",
    "+ similarly , on @xmath7 we may consider @xmath47 this tensor field , in contravariant form , may be also considered as a bi - differential operator , i.e. , we may define a binary bilinear product on real smooth functions by setting ( ( f , g ) ) = ( + i ) ( -i)which decomposes into a symmetric bracket ( f , g ) = + and a skew - symmetric bracket \\{f , g } = - .this last bracket defines a poisson bracket on smooth functions defined on @xmath5 . + summarizing , we can replace our original hilbert space with an hilbert manifold , i.e. an even dimensional real manifold on which we have tensor fields in covariant form g = dx_jdx^j + dy_jdy^j = dy_jdx^j - dx_jdy^j , or tensor fields in contravariant form g^-1 = + ^-1 = - , along with a complex structure tensor field j = dx^j - dy^j .",
    "the contravariant tensor fields , considered as bi - differential operators define a symmetric product and a skew symmetric product on real smooth functions .",
    "the skew - symmetric product actually defines a poisson bracket .",
    "in particular , for functions f_a ( ) = @xmath14,,associated with hermitian operators @xmath28 , we shall end up with the relations f_[a , b]_+ g^-1(df_a , df_b).f_[a , b]_- ^-1(df_a , df_b),which replaces symmetric and anti - symmetric operator products @xmath48_{\\pm}$ ] by symmetric and anti - symmetric tensor fields respectively .",
    "hence , via these tensor fields we may identify symmetric and poisson brackets on the set of quadratic functions according to f_[a , b]_+ = ( f_a , f_b),f_[a , b]_- = \\{f_a , f_b},which synthesize to a star - product ( ( f , g ) ) = ( f_a , f_b)+i\\{f_a , f_b}:=f_af_b and turn therefore the set of quadratic functions into a c - star algebra . in this way we may encode the original non - commutative structure on operators in terms of ` classical ' , i.e.riemannian and symplectic tensor fields according to f_af_b = f_ab ( ) = ( g^-1+i^-1)(df_a ( ) , df_b()).to take into account the geometry of the set of physical ( pure ) states , we need to modify @xmath49 and @xmath50 by a conformal factor to turn them into projectable tensor fields on @xmath8 .",
    "the projection is generated at the infinitesimal level by the real and imaginary parts of the action of @xmath51 on @xmath27 given by the dilation vector field @xmath52 and the @xmath53-phase rotation generating vector field @xmath54 respectively . in this way we shall identify ( )",

    "this regard one finds a generic function on @xmath8 defines a quantum evolution , via the associated hamiltonian vector field , if and only if the vector field is a derivation for the riemann - jordan product @xcite .",
    "+ the geometric formulation of the hilbert space picture reviewed here so far can be summerized at this point by a ` dictionary ' as follows @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      one interesting aspect for the current applications of the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics is the possibility to induce tensor fields in covariant form on a given submanifold via a pull - back procedure @xcite .",

    "the latter admits a smooth embedding via the unitary action of the lie group as orbit manifold @xmath70 in the hilbert space and establishes therefore a pull - back of the hermitian structure both on the orbit @xmath70 and the homogenous space @xmath69 .",
