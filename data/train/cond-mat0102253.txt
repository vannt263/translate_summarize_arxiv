    "crystallising proteins from dilute solution is in general rather difficult , yet the crystalline form is required in order to perform x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "x - ray crystallography is currently the best method of determining the all - important structure of a protein in its native state .",
    "this has lead to considerable interest in how proteins crystallise ; see ref . for a recent review from a colloidal physics perspective and refs . for recent work . in a dilute solution",
    "there may be a large free energy barrier to nucleation of the crystalline phase @xcite , which prevents nucleation on accessible time scales . here",
    ", we consider a generic model protein which in the _ absence _ of polymer already has coexistence between a dilute solution and a crystalline phase .",
    "we determine how the barrier to homogeneous nucleation of the crystalline phase changes when non - adsorbing polymer coils which are larger than the protein molecules are added to the protein solution .",
    "we find that the polymer lowers the nucleation barrier .",
    "this is to be expected as it is well - known that non - adsorbing polymer induces an effective attraction between the protein molecules , and an attraction will favour the dense crystalline phase .",
    "however , what is much less common , is that for large polymer coils it is essential to account for the fact that the polymer - induced attraction is strongly non - pairwise additive . a naive calculation using in the crystalline phase , the effective pair potential in dilute phase of protein molecules , greatly overestimates the effect of the polymer .",
    "protein molecules are typically a few nms across and the root - mean - square end - to - end distance of a flexible polymer can easily be several times this .",
    "the protein ",
    "protein interaction consists of a repulsive core of diameter @xmath0 and an attraction which is sufficiently strong to cause the equilibrium behaviour to be coexistence between a dense crystal and a dilute fluid phase . we do not need to specify the potential explicitly as we will require only the fluid - crystal interfacial tension @xmath1 and the difference in chemical potential between that of the crystal and that of the fluid , @xmath2 .",
    "we use the subscript 0 to indicate quantities before polymer is added .",
    "our results should therefore apply to a very wide range of proteins despite potentially very large variations in the structure and interactions of different proteins @xcite .",
    "the polymer is non - adsorbing : the interaction between the protein molecule and a monomer is purely repulsive .",
    "there has been extensive work done on systems of small colloidal particles immersed in polymer solutions of larger polymer coils which do not adsorb on the particles @xcite .",
    "scaling theory for these systems was pioneered by de gennes @xcite , see also refs . .",
    "field - theoretic methods have yielded results which are exact for small hard particles and ideal polymers @xcite , as well as approximate results for polymers in good solvents @xcite .",
    "work has also been done using integral equations , see ref . and references therein .",
    "it is well understood that non - adsorbing polymer increases the chemical potential of particles and induces an attraction between these particles which is not pairwise additive : the interaction of three close - by protein molecules is not the sum of three pair potentials @xcite . however , most of this work ( exceptions are refs . ) only considered a few particles , two or three , whereas a nucleus of a crystalline phase contains 10s of tightly - packed particles . because of this , the deviations from pairwise additivity observed here are much stronger than found in previous work .",
    "the next section briefly outlines classical nucleation theory for the solution before polymer is added .",
    "section 3 then describes the effect of polymer and section 4 is a conclusion .",
    "the interaction between protein molecules is taken to include a steeply repulsive core and an attraction .",
    "this attraction may be isotropic or highly anisotropic or a mixture of the two , if isotropic it may or may not be short - ranged ; all we require is that it render a dilute solution of the protein metastable with respect to a crystalline phase of the protein . by metastable",
    "we mean that the fluid phase is not the equilibrium phase , it does not correspond to the absolute minimum in the appropriate free energy , but the fluid phase is dynamically stable with respect to crystallisation for times much larger than the characteristic time of the solution .",
    "see ref . for a general introduction to the properties and behaviour of metastable fluids .",
    "classical nucleation theory @xcite assumes that the nucleus of the crystalline phase has a free energy @xmath3 which is the sum of a bulk term and surface term .",
    "see the book of debenedetti @xcite for an excellent introduction to classical nucleation theory .",
    "the protein molecules are modeled by spherical particles of diameter @xmath0 .",
    "the bulk term is equal to the number of molecules in the nucleus , @xmath4 , times the chemical potential difference @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential of the crystalline phase and @xmath7 is the chemical potential of the fluid phase which contains the nucleus .",
    "the fluid phase we are considering is not the true equilibrium phase , nucleation occurs from a fluid which is at a higher chemical potential than the crystal .",
    "thus @xmath8 is negative .",
    "the surface term is the surface area of the nucleus times the surface tension @xmath9 of the bulk interface between the coexisting crystalline and fluid phases .",
    "the surface area of the nucleus is obtained by assuming that the nucleus is a sphere of radius @xmath10 which is related to @xmath4 by assuming that the density of spheres within the nucleus is equal to the bulk density of the crystalline phase , taken to be @xmath11 : the density of a close - packed simple cubic lattice",
    ". then @xmath12 .",
    "putting this all together , @xmath13 the first term in @xmath3 is the bulk term , which is negative and decreases linearly with @xmath4 , and the second term is the surface term which is positive and increases as @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath3 passes through a maximum , denoted by @xmath15 , at some value of @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "this maximum is the top of the free energy barrier to nucleation .",
    "the nucleus with radius @xmath16 and @xmath17 spheres is called the critical nucleus . taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) with respect to @xmath10 and equating to zero , @xmath18 and inserting this value of @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) @xmath19 nucleation is an activated process with @xmath15 as the barrier height and so the nucleation rate varies as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are boltzmann s constant and the temperature @xmath22 , respectively . to increase the rate of nucleation of the crystalline phase of the protein we need to reduce the barrier @xmath15 . in the absence of polymer @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ ncnt ] ) and ( [ cnt ] ) by setting @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "now we consider a solution of both protein molecules and flexible polymer molecules . the interaction between a protein molecule and a monomer",
    "is taken to be strictly repulsive .",
    "figure [ figschem ] is a schematic of the nucleus in a solution of polymer .",
    "we remark that this simple model is not adequate for all polymers , for example it is not adequate for peg ( poly(ethylene glycol ) ) .",
    "we consider the case where the polymer molecules are larger than the protein molecules and the polymer solution is semidilute . as the protein molecules are only a few nms in diameter this regime is easily accessible in experiment . in the other limit , where the polymer s radius is smaller than that of the colloidal particles ,",
    "the polymer induces a short - ranged depletion attraction between the particles .",
    "such attractions are to a good approximation pairwise additive @xcite and therefore straightforward to treat",
    ". see refs . for work where the polymer is at most as large as the colloid .",
    "see the book of de gennes @xcite for an introduction to semidilute polymer solutions .",
    "they are characterised by a correlation length @xmath25 which scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the monomer concentration . the osmotic pressure exerted by the polymer @xmath28 .",
    "the crystalline phase of the protein is dense , the gaps between protein molecules available to polymer are around @xmath29 or less across . forcing a polymer molecule into a tube of diameter @xmath29 costs roughly @xmath30 in free energy per @xmath29 of the tube s length as the polymer collides with the walls of the tube at intervals of roughly its diameter .",
    "thus , the free energy density inside such a crystal , either a bulk crystal or a crystalline nucleus , will be of order @xmath30 per @xmath31 volume whereas in solution it is @xmath30 per @xmath32 volume .",
    "for @xmath25 larger than @xmath0 , which we assume throughout , the free energy density inside a crystal is so much higher than outside that to a good approximation there is no polymer inside the crystal .",
    "this agrees with calculations using the theory of ref . .",
    "so , as the crystalline nucleus is impermeable to polymer it interacts with the polymer , as a hard particle of radius @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction @xmath33 of a hard spherical particle of diameter @xmath0 with a semidilute solution of polymer in a good solvent with a correlation length @xmath25 is @xcite @xmath34 where we took the exponent @xmath35 to have its flory value of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is the work done (= the difference in excess chemical potential ) in taking a particle from a pure solvent and inserting it into the polymer solution .",
    "this assumes that the interaction between a protein and the monomers of a polymer is purely repulsive and that there is not much more than one protein molecule per @xmath32 volume .",
    "the notation @xmath37 indicates that we have neglected a coefficient of order unity ; here we derive only the scaling behaviour of the interactions with respect to the relevant length scales .",
    "equation ( [ wsmall ] ) can be derived in a couple of ways , see refs . .",
    "one way is to note that when @xmath38 the interaction between a particle and polymer must scale as the density of monomers , which scales as @xmath39 when @xmath40 . as @xmath41 is dimensionless",
    ", we require that @xmath39 appears as the ratio @xmath42 which gives eq .",
    "( [ wsmall ] ) .",
    "straightaway we can derive an approximation for the contribution of polymer to the difference in excess chemical potential @xmath8 between the dense crystalline phase of the protein , and the semidilute polymer solution . it is @xmath43 where the second term on the right hand side is the change in free energy of the polymer when a single protein molecule is removed from the semidilute polymer solution and the last term is the change in free energy of this solution when it is compressed by the crystalline phase of the protein expanding by the volume of one protein .",
    "the osmotic pressure of a polymer solution @xmath44 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the last term is equal to @xmath45 and so is smaller than the second term , indeed it is of order terms we have dropped and so we drop it and obtain our final expression for @xmath46 in the presence of polymer , @xmath47    for a large nucleus , radius @xmath48 , the width of the nucleus  polymer - solution interface , @xmath25 , is small and so the capillarity approximation which underlies classical nucleation theory still holds : @xmath3 is still a sum of bulk and interfacial terms .",
    "the bulk term is given by the @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) times the number of protein molecules in the nucleus . in the presence of semidilute polymer the the interfacial tension of a flat interface , @xmath9 is @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath1 is the interfacial tension in the absence of polymer .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath1 will be at least of order @xmath50 we see that the fractional modification to @xmath1 due to polymer is of order @xmath51 . for a @xmath2 of order @xmath30 , the fractional change to @xmath8 due to polymer",
    "is , see eq .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) , of order @xmath42 . within our crude scaling theory",
    "we only consider leading order contributions and so neglect the contribution of the polymer to @xmath9 , leaving the only contribution of polymer as the change in @xmath8 given by eq .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) .    in the opposite limit for @xmath10 , @xmath52 ,",
    "then the contribution of polymer to the free energy of the nucleus is no longer the sum of bulk and interfacial terms , i.e. , it is not the sum of terms scaling as @xmath53 and as @xmath54 . for",
    "@xmath55 the contribution of the polymer to the free energy of formation of the nucleus @xmath15 is the sum of two terms : the first is the number of protein molecules in the nucleus times minus the increase in chemical potential in solution due to polymer , eq .",
    "( [ wsmall ] ) , and the second is the free energy cost of inserting the nucleus into the polymer solution .",
    "this second term is the free energy cost due to the nucleus excluding polymer from a sphere of radius @xmath10 . because the polymer can not penetrate into the nucleus it interacts with the polymer as a single particle , and so this free energy cost is just eq .",
    "( [ wsmall ] ) with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath56 . adding the two terms together we have the contribution of polymer to @xmath3 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the free energy of formation of the nucleus before polymer is added . for @xmath10 a few times @xmath0 and @xmath59 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ smallr ] ) dominates the last term .",
    "so , we neglect the last term in eq .",
    "( [ smallr ] ) .",
    "then as the remaining term is linear in @xmath4 it is in effect a shift in @xmath8 and indeed is the same shift in @xmath8 we found in the opposite limit , @xmath48 .",
    "thus we conclude that as for @xmath48 the leading order contribution of semidilute polymer to the nucleation barrier is simply to shift @xmath8 by the amount given in eq .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) .",
    "so , we have shown that in both limits , @xmath48 and @xmath55 , the effect of adding polymer in the semidilute regime is to shift the chemical potential difference @xmath8 by an amount of order @xmath60 , which will be a few tenths of @xmath30 .",
    "having shown that it holds in both limits we assume that it also holds for @xmath61 as well .",
    "the shift varies as @xmath39 and so increases linearly with the density of polymer .",
    "the size of the critical nucleus also decreases , eq .",
    "( [ ncnt ] ) .",
    "thus , if decreasing @xmath8 by a few tenths of @xmath30 is enough to reduce the nucleation barrier sufficiently to make the nucleation rate significant then adding semidilute polymer is a viable way of inducing nucleation of the crystalline phase of small colloidal particles such as proteins and micelles .",
    "a pair of particles in a semidilute polymer solution separated by a distance @xmath62 of order @xmath25 or less feel a polymer - induced attraction towards each other , which we denote by @xmath63 @xcite . for small particles , @xmath64 , and for separations @xmath65 much smaller than the correlation length @xcite @xmath66",
    "naively it might be thought that the contribution of polymer to the free energy change @xmath46 could be estimated using this pair attraction plus a mean - field approximation , which would correspond to the approximation @xmath67 which is just the integral over the number density , @xmath11 in the crystalline phase , times the potential . as usual with a mean - field approximation , correlations in the positions of particles are neglected and one protein is considered to interact with surrounding particles which are at the mean density .",
    "the above integral is @xmath11 times the contribution of polymer to the second virial coefficient .",
    "see eisenriegler @xcite for a more accurate treatment of the contribution of polymer to the second virial coefficient .",
    "so , inserting eq .",
    "( [ hanke ] ) , into eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath68 if we compare eqs .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) and ( [ mf ] ) we see that the assumption of a pairwise additive potential plus the mean - field approximation predicts the wrong scaling with @xmath69 of the polymer contribution to @xmath46 .",
    "it greatly overestimates , by a factor of order @xmath70 , the effect of adding polymer whose correlation length is large with respect to the protein diameter . naively using the pair potential between an isolated pair of particles , ( a pair of particles with no others within a distance @xmath25 of them ) , as the pair interaction within a dense",
    ", number density @xmath71 ( here the crystal ) , is qualitatively wrong .",
    "we have estimated the change in the barrier to nucleation when polymer is added to a metastable dilute protein solution .",
    "the polymer is semidilute , and has a correlation length @xmath25 larger than the diameter of the protein @xmath0 ; the polymer does not adsorb onto the surface of the protein .",
    "when polymer is added , the barrier @xmath15 is reduced due to the increase in the chemical potential of the protein in solution , possibly by enough to allow nucleation .",
    "however , the effect is not large , @xmath8 decreases by only a few tenths of @xmath30 .",
    "also , a naive use of the polymer induced attraction between a pair of proteins yields results which are qualitatively wrong : they grossly overestimate the effect of adding polymer .",
    "this does not mean that an effective potential approach to the effect of polymer can not reliably estimate the effect of large polymer molecules , just that this effective potential is many - body in nature and can not simply be approximated by just a pair potential .",
    "this conclusion also applies to the phase behaviour of a system of hard - sphere - like colloidal particles and larger polymer molecules @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the second virial coefficient @xmath72 is often used to measure the strength of the attractions in a protein solution .",
    "@xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the second virial coefficient in the absence of polymer and we have assumed not only that @xmath75 is small but that @xmath74 is dominated by interactions with a range @xmath76 : then the second virial coefficient is the sum of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "so as the polymer density _ increases _ , @xmath25 decreases and the contribution of polymer to @xmath72 _ decreases_. but from eq .",
    "( [ dmup ] ) we see that as the polymer density increases it has a larger and larger effect on the nucleation barrier .",
    "so , the effect of polymer on @xmath72 is _",
    "anti_-correlated with its effect on @xmath15 , i.e. , when one goes up the other goes down , not correlated as we might naively have expected .",
    "as emphasised by evans and coworkers , see for example refs .",
    ", the interaction is only strictly pairwise additive if the polymer is both ideal and does not interact with a particle more than @xmath77 times its radius away . however , if the polymer is larger than this but still small with respect to the protein molecule , the potential will be close to pairwise additive .",
    "then the simultaneous interaction of a polymer molecule with more than two protein molecules ( which is the origin of deviations from pairwise additivity ) will be weak .",
    "in the other limit , which we consider here , where the polymer is much larger than the protein , the polymer molecule can potentially interact with _ many _ protein molecules , inducing an effective interaction which is very far from being pairwise additive ."
