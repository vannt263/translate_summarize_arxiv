    "the two most productive methods for discovering exoplanets have been surveys hunting for periodic changes in radial velocity motion seen in stellar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and photometric searches for planetary transits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . from the radial velocity method",
    "the planet s minimum mass ( @xmath10 ) can be derived while the transit method allows for the measurement of the planetary radius and the orbital inclination .",
    "neither technique can give the planet s density when used alone and knowledge of the stellar radius and mass are required for the radial velocity and transit methods , respectively .",
    "several dozen transiting planets have a measured density from follow - up radial velocity observations ( both http://exoplanet.eu [ @xcite ] and http://exoplanets.org [ @xcite ] provide up to date lists of planetary characteristics ) , but this requires a significant amount of telescope time and the use of high precision spectrographs . until recently",
    ", no planet has had a mass derived from photometry alone .",
    "the first planets with masses measured from photometry were found through observations of transit timing variations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however this technique is limited to systems with multiple dynamically interacting planets .",
    "the analysis of the light curves of transiting exoplanet host stars using space based photometers have enabled the measurement of ellipsoidal variations ( a recent review is given in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and doppler beaming caused by transiting planets from which the planetary mass can be determined @xcite .",
    "ellipsoidal variations are periodic flux variations resulting from a orbiting body raising a tide on the host star .",
    "the star is therefore non - spherical and varies in brightness as a function of the visible surface area .",
    "the dominant period of this signal will be half the orbital period of the planet .",
    "doppler beaming is a combination of a bolometric and a bandpass dependent effect . as a star moves due to the gravitational pull of a companion",
    ", the angular distribution of stellar flux will be beamed in the direction of the star s velocity vector .",
    "this effect is bolometric and results in an observed periodic brightness change proportional to the star s radial velocity .",
    "the bandpass dependent effect is a periodic red / blue shift in the spectral energy distribution of the star which results in the measured brightness of the star changing as the flux falling within the bandpass changes .",
    "the magnitude of this effect depends not only on the radial velocity of the star but also on the stellar spectrum and the observational bandpass .",
    "the number of stars for which either planetary induced ellipsoidal variation or doppler beaming have been observered can be counted on one hand .",
    "@xcite observed ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming in the phase curve ( the complete flux time - series of the star folded on the planetary orbital period ) of corot-3 , the host to a 22 @xmath11 planet / brown dwarf .",
    "more recently , observations of hat - p-7 @xcite and koi-13.01 @xcite have been used to derive planet masses photometrically . using the whole phase curve",
    "has also been shown to be a promising method for confirming the planetary nature of sources without the need for follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "light from the planet itself also contributes to the out - of - transit phase curve profile of host stars .",
    "the optical light from a cool planet is mainly owing to scattered starlight from the host star but hotter planets , such as the population of hot jupiters , also contribute significant thermal emission at both infra - red and optical wavelengths . from the ratio of a planet s flux",
    "( the combination of thermal emission and scattered light ) to the stellar flux measured at full phase , the geometric albedo can be computed .",
    "the optical planet - to - star flux ratio has been measured for a small number of systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and robust upper limits have been placed on others @xcite .",
    "combining a measurement of an occultation ( secondary eclipse ) depth and the star - to - planet flux ratio can help determine the planet s night and day side equilibrium temperatures @xcite , atmospheric composition @xcite , heat redistribution @xcite and even changing exoplanet weather patterns .",
    "the study of exoplanets is often limited by the difficulty in determining stellar masses and radii from spectroscopy alone due to the strong degeneracies between effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "uncertainties on a spectroscopically derived radius can be at the level of 50% @xcite .",
    "asteroseismic observations of solar - like oscillations can be used to reduce these uncertainties to less than 5% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we analyze the photometric time series observations of the planet host star a ( listed in the kepler input catalog with identification number 11446443 ) made using the spacecraft .",
    "we simultaneously fit transit , occulation , and phase curve effects to determine the radius of and derive the mass of the planet by measuring the amplitude of doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations .",
    "is an ideal target for phase curve analysis because ( a ) the star is relatively bright ( @xmath12 ) , ( b ) it has been observed by in short cadence mode since the beginning of the mission30 min @xcite . ] , ( c ) we detect solar - like oscillations on the star , ( d ) we see very little stellar activity , ( e ) the orbit of is very close to circular @xcite , ( f ) no variations in the transit times of are detected @xcite , and ( g ) a detection of light from the planet has previously been claimed ( indeed , this planet has previously been reported to be the darkest known exoplanet ) @xcite .",
    "the spacecraft was launched in 2009 with the goal of discovering transiting exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the planet is one of only three to be discovered before the launch of @xcite .",
    "these three previously known exoplanets have been observed in short cadence mode @xcite since the start of the mission .",
    "we use the quarters 0 - 11 short cadence observations ( where the short cadence sampling rate is 58.85 s ) of which span a total of 978 days .",
    "no data is used for q4 and q8 owing to star falling on a failed ccd during these quarters .",
    "we used simple aperture photometry data ( shown in the top panel in figure  [ fig : fulllc ] ) as opposed to time series which have undergone pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) as currently available short - cadence pdc data can distort astrophysical signals on timescales comparable to the orbital period of @xcite .",
    "we removed instrumental signals by fitting cotrending basis vectors to the time series of each quarter individually using the pyke kepler community software .",
    "details of the cotrending basis vectors are given in the kepler data processing handbook @xcite and their use described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cotrending basis vectors are only calculated for long cadence data ( 29.4 min sampling ) so we interpolated onto the short cadence time - stamps using cubic splines .",
    "the light curve after the application of the cotrending basis vectors is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : fulllc ] .        in order to remove quarter - to - quarter discontinuities we normalized each quarter to the median .",
    "doing this is appropriate because contamination from background sources is very low for ( typically less than 2% ) .",
    "when analyzing transit photometry it is common for data to be high - pass filtered in order to remove intrinsic stellar variability .",
    "however , we found this unnecessary because a is intrinsically fairly quiet on timescale of days  there is little discernible variability owing to star - spots .",
    "filtering has the potential to damp the signals we are interested in and so being able to avoid filtering is highly preferable .",

    "tres-2a was among the first exoplanet host stars in the kepler field to be analyzed using asteroseismology .",
    "the initial analysis by @xcite , based on the first 40 days of data , yielded a tentative detection of equally spaced peaks which was found to be in rough agreement with the properties derived by @xcite . to improve the stellar properties",
    ", we have analyzed all available short - cadence data up to q11 using the method described by @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the method employs a frequency - resolved autocorrelation to locate the excess power due to solar - like oscillations . after correcting the power spectrum for contributions due to granuation , the large frequency separation ( the average spacing between oscillation modes of the same spherical degree and consecutive radial order ) is calculated by fitting a gaussian function to the highest peak of the power spectrum autocorrelation centered on the frequency of maximum power .",
    "we note that the method by @xcite has been thoroughly tested against independent methods @xcite and has been extensively applied for the analysis of single stars and large ensembles of stars observed with kepler ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis yielded a clear detection of excess power near 3400 , consistent with solar - like oscillations .",
    "figure [ fig : ps](a ) displays the power spectrum centered around the power excess . note that we have checked the frequency range for known artifacts in kepler short - cadence data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and found no corresponding peaks in our data .",
    "the characteristic regular spacing indicative of p - mode oscillations is visible .",
    "we find @xmath21 , with uncertainties estimated using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : ps](c ) shows the power spectrum shown in figure [ fig : ps](a ) after folding it on a frequency of @xmath22 and summing up all power between @xmath23 , which roughly corresponds to the frequency range where oscillation modes are visible .",
    "there are three peaks in the folded power spectrum which we identify as oscillation modes of spherical degree @xmath24 and 2 .",
    "the measured small frequency separation , the amount by which @xmath25 modes are offset from @xmath26 modes , from the folded spectrum is @xmath27 , which is fully consistent with a sun - like star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the s / n is not high enough to a precisely constrain the frequency of maximum power and it has hence not been used in the remainder of this analysis .    to test the significance of the detection , we first divided the data in two parts and calculated the power spectrum of each dataset .",
    "the result in shown in figure [ fig : ps](b ) , which shows the power spectra after heavily smoothing them with a gaussian filter with a fwhm = @xmath28 to suppress the stochastic nature of the signal ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the excess power at @xmath293400  is visible in both datasets , confirming that the excess power in the combined dataset is present in independent parts of the data .",
    "we furthermore performed simulations by generating time series with white noise corresponding to the time - domain scatter of the original data , and by randomly shuffling the original data with replacement . for each simulated dataset",
    "we performed the same analysis as for the original data .",
    "the results showed that the @xmath30 peak in the collapsed power spectrum ( which primarily constrains the large separation ) is detected at a level of @xmath31 , corresponding to a @xmath32 probability that the peak is not due to random noise .",
    "these tests , combined with the fact that the large frequency separation , small frequency separation , and location of the power excess are fully consistent for a solar - type star , give us confidence that the detected asteroseismic signal is robust .    the large separation can been shown to be directly related to the mean density of the star @xcite :    @xmath33    equation ( [ equ : dnu ] ) has been tested both theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "using our measured value above we arrive at a mean stellar density of @xmath34 g@xmath35 for . to estimate a full set of stellar parameters , we adopt @xmath18 and [ fe / h ] from @xcite and compare our constraints with a dense grid of quadratically interpolated basti stellar evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "we start by identifying the maximum likelihood model assuming gaussian likelihood functions for @xmath36 , @xmath18 and [ fe / h ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we note that the uncertainties on the stellar properties stated in table 1 do not include contributions from uncertainties due to different model grids , which have been shown to be on the order of 2% in radius and 5% in mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "@xcite derive a parameter @xmath39 to denote the expected ratio of the ellipsoidal amplitude to the beaming amplitude which they define as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in units of solar mass and solar radius and @xmath43 is in days .",
    "note that we must divide our value of @xmath44 by 4 in order to be consistent with @xcite . for we find @xmath45 , which is within 2-@xmath7 of the expected value of @xmath46 .",
    "this difference is not particularly significant and we do not find this overly concerning .    we measure a radius for of @xmath47 r@xmath48 which is consistent with previously published values @xcite .",
    "however , the radial velocity semi - amplitude we calculate from photometry ( @xmath49 ms@xmath50 ) is significantly larger than the value measured by @xcite of @xmath51 m s@xmath50 using spectroscopic radial velocity data , hence the mass derived from doppler beaming is also on the high side .",
    "our derived mass is @xmath291-@xmath7 higher than the mass found by @xcite , and 2@xmath7 higher than the mass found by @xcite who use the same radial velocity data as @xcite but with revised stellar parameters .",
    "our masses derived from the ellipsoidal variations and from doppler beaming differ by 2-@xmath7 .",
    "the mass derived from beaming is usually taken to be the ground truth because it can be calculated in a relatively model independent way whereas equation  [ equ : morris ] is an approximation and relies on the accuracy of the equations used to describe limb and gravity darkening .",
    "@xcite discuss the limitations of this approximation for a earlier - type star such as koi-13a , however in the case of a star with a convective envelope such as a the approximation should describe the amplitude owing to ellipsoidal variations reasonably well .",
    "for the planet mass we adopt the weighted average of the mass derived from doppler beaming and from ellipsoidal variations where the weighting is based on the standard deviation the mcmc chain masses as a proxy for uncertainty .",
    "this results in the mass of being @xmath52 .",
    "we stress that this value does not supersede previous measurements from spectroscopic radial velocity observations , but merely demonstrates that this technique can be used to determine a planet mass consistent with other observations albeit at lower accuracy .",
    "however , the ability to derive masses consistent with valuable multiple epoch , high - resolution spectra for radial velocities should not be overlooked .",
    "as discussed earlier , rmer delay is not included in our model .",
    "we estimate the observed time of occultation will be offset by 34.5 s compared to what would be seen if the speed of light was infinite @xcite .",
    "the rmer delay equates to a change in @xmath53 of 0.00051 @xcite .",
    "we add this value in quadrature to our previously derived uncertainties on @xmath53 to give a final value of @xmath54 .",
    "this equates to an eccentricity of @xmath55 .",
    "this tight constraint on the eccentricity of the planet ( the 3-@xmath7 upper limit is 0.0025 ) is consistent with the expectations of tidal dissipation .",
    "this low eccentricity suggests that the method of @xcite for observing apsidal precession due to the planetary interior is not possible with the existing data .",
    "a growing number of planets have infrared emission spectroscopy from spitzer and adding the kepler data point to the existing data can be an important extra constraint for differentiating inverted and non - inverted atmospheres @xcite .",
    "we have modeled the atmosphere of tres-2b using the methods described in @xcite and @xcite . in figure [ caroline ]",
    "we compare the day - side planet - to - star flux ratio data to three atmosphere models .",
    "the models shown use a redistribution factor @xmath56 of 0.5 or 0.45 , to simulate redistribution of absorbed stellar flux over the entire day side ( @xmath57 ) or with a slight loss to the night side @xmath58 .",
    "the yellow model does not include tio / vo as gaseous absorbers , leaving gaseous na and k to absorb optical flux at much higher pressures , and a temperature inversion does not occur .",
    "the blue and red models include equilibrium mixing ratios of tio / vo , and possess temperature inversions .",
    "tio and vo gases have exceptionally strong optical opacity , and can lead to temperature inversions @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _ data plotted in figure [ caroline ] are from @xcite and the @xmath59 datum from @xcite .",
    "croll et al .",
    "used similar methods to fortney et al . to find a best - fit atmosphere model that included a temperature inversion , but it was only a marginally better fit than the no inversion model .",
    "however , with the inclusion of the _ kepler _ data point , a model with a temperature inversion is now more strongly preferred . @xcite",
    "have also modeled tres-2b , using the same data shown here , except the _ kepler _ data point was a preliminary number @xcite .",
    "these authors find a significantly better fit with a temperature inversion as well .",
    "models that lack tio or a similar high altitude strong optical absorber are often too bright at optical wavelengths . this can be seen in figure [ caroline ] and @xcite figure 2a .",
    "the very low geometric albedo detected for tres-2b of @xmath8 is in line with model predictions for cloud free hot jupiter atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the relatively small day - to - night brightness contrast of @xmath2 ppm is quite interesting , but potentially difficult to understand in a simple way .",
    "if tio ( or a similar optical absorber ) is present on the day side , it may well condense out on the night side ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this could mean the depth probed in the _ kepler _ bandpass could be at a pressure @xmath60 larger on the night side .",
    "this same dramatic change in opacity likely does not happen in the near or mid infrared @xcite , since h@xmath61o is the dominant absorber in both hemispheres , and the day and night abundances of co and ch@xmath62 may be homogenized due to vertical and horizontal mixing @xcite .",
    "a strong possibility for tres-2b is that the brightness temperature of the inverted day - side atmosphere probes pressures of @xmath29  10 mbar , which may be quite similar in temperature to that on the night side near 1 bar .",
    "another possibility for the warm night side of tres-2b could be energy dissipation due to a variety of potential mechanisms @xcite , which could be expressed as a higher temperature at 1 bar .",
    "we note that @xcite also found a small ( @xmath29  300",
    "k ) day - night brightness temperature contrast for hat - p-7b in the _ kepler _ band , although @xcite , with more data , suggest the difference is greater than 700 k.    the day - side to night - side planet flux ratio we determine is lower than that found by @xcitewho detected a phase curve reflection / emission component with a full - amplitude of @xmath63 ppm which is higher than the @xmath2 ppm we detect , although still within 12-@xmath7 .",
    "we have discovered ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming in the phase curve of the star - planet system .",
    "an asteroseismic analysis of the solar - like oscillations on the star allows us to derive an accurate stellar mass and radius . using the approach of @xcite we derived a mass of of @xmath64 @xmath11 from the doppler beaming effect and @xmath65 @xmath11 from the ellipsoidal variations . that these two values are independent and that they agree to within 2-@xmath7 and are within in 13@xmath7 of literature values strengthens our belief that the variations are not instrumental or induced by stellar variability .",
    "we are further convinced that what we detect is truly induced by the planet because the ratio of ellipsoidal to beaming amplitudes agrees within @xmath292-@xmath7 of theoretically expected values .",
    "we detect a difference between the day and the night side flux from of the level of @xmath2 ppm , lower than the amplitude reported by @xcite .",
