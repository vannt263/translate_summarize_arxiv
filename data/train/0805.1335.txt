    "accurately determining the global properties of the high - redshift galaxy population is a powerful method of constraining current models of galaxy evolution , and identifying the sources responsible for reionisation .",
    "large , statistical samples of high - redshift galaxies can be identified efficiently using two complementary photometric techniques .",
    "firstly , lyman - alpha emitters ( laes ) can be selected via deep imaging with narrow - band filters centred on the redshifted lyman - alpha emission line ( hu , mcmahon & cowie 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , so - called lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) can be selected from deep broad - band photometry using the lyman - break , or `` dropout '' , technique pioneered by guhathakurta , tyson & majewski ( 1990 ) .    when combined with deep multi - wavelength photometry and spectroscopic follow - up ,",
    "narrow - band selection of laes is an efficient technique for producing large samples of high - redshift galaxies within narrow redshift intervals , free from significant levels of contamination . by exploiting the wide - field imaging capabilities of suprime - cam on subaru ,",
    "several recent studies have investigated the number densities , luminosity functions and clustering properties of laes at @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( e.g. ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "moreover , at present , the highest - redshift galaxy with spectroscopic confirmation ( @xmath23 ; iye et al .",
    "2006 ) was identified using the narrow - band technique ( see stark et al .",
    "2007a for candidate laes at @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , although lae studies have many advantages , they are constrained by the fact that any individual study can only survey a comparatively small cosmological volume and that only a minority of lbgs at high redshift appear to be strong laes ( e.g. shapley et al .",
    "therefore , although the selection function of the lyman - break technique is more difficult to quantify , because it includes both laes and non - laes , it should provide a more complete census of the high - redshift galaxy population .",
    "consequently , many studies in the recent literature have exploited both ground - based and hubble space telescope ( hst ) data to study the properties of high - redshift galaxies selected via the lyman - break technique . in particular , due to its unparallelled point - source sensitivity , deep hst imaging has allowed studies of the high - redshift luminosity function to reach @xmath25 , and has therefore been crucial to constraining both the normalization and faint - end slope of the luminosity function at @xmath26 ( e.g. dickinson et al . 2004 ; malhotra et al . 2005 ; oesch et al . 2007 ; bouwens et al . 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; reddy et al .",
    "2007 ) . in terms of best - fitting schechter function",
    "parameters the results of these studies have described a fairly consistent picture , with the majority finding a very steep faint - end slope , typically in the range @xmath27 ( although see sawicki & thompson 2006 for a different result at @xmath28 ) , and little evidence for significant evolution in either the faint - end slope or normalization at @xmath29 .",
    "although studies based on deep hst imaging have been successful at exploring the faint end of the high - redshift luminosity function , their small areal coverage means that they are not ideally suited to accurately constraining the bright end of the luminosity function . to address this issue studies based on shallower , but wider area , ground - based imaging have been important ( e.g. ouchi et al . 2004a ; shimasaku et al . 2005 ; yoshida et al . 2006 ; iwata et al . 2007 ) . to date",
    ", although the existing wide - area , ground - based optical imaging surveys have been very useful for constraining the bright end of the lbg luminosity function in the redshift range @xmath30 , it has been difficult to successfully extend ground - based studies to higher redshift .",
    "the reason for this is that without the benefits of hst spatial resolution to exclude low - redshift contaminants ( i.e red galaxies at @xmath31 and ultra - cool galactic stars ) , selecting clean samples of @xmath32 lbg candidates requires near - infrared photometryfilters to quantify the uv slope of a small sample of 12 redshift @xmath33 candidates in the subaru deep field by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is one notable exception . ] to confirm a relatively blue spectral index long - ward of lyman alpha .",
    "unfortunately , due to the lack of wide area near - infrared detectors , until very recently it was not possible to obtain suitably deep near - infrared imaging over areas commensurate with the existing wide - area optical surveys .    however , with the advent of deep near - infrared imaging over a 0.8 square  degree field provided by the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) this fundamental issue is now being addressed . in a previous paper ( mclure et al .",
    "2006 ) we combined the early data release of the uds with optical imaging from the subaru / xmm - newton survey ( sxds ) to explore the properties of the most luminous ( @xmath34 ) galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "in this paper we extend this previous study by using new , deeper , @xmath36 imaging of the uds field to study the properties of a much larger sample of @xmath37 lbgs in the redshift range @xmath1 .",
    "the specific aim of this study was to use the large , contiguous area of the uds to provide an improved measurement of the bright end of the uv - selected luminosity function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 , and to measure the clustering properties , and thereby halo masses , of the luminous lbg population at @xmath35 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the properties of the near - infrared and optical data - sets used in this study . in section 3",
    "we describe our initial selection criteria and our photometric redshift analysis . in section 4",
    "we describe our adopted technique for estimating the lbg luminosity function . in section 5 we present our luminosity function results , and the results of combining our ground - based data with existing constraints derived from deep hst imaging data . in section 6 we report the results of our study of the clustering properties of the luminous lbg population in the redshift range @xmath3 and link the lbg population to that of the underlying dark matter halos . in section 7",
    "we provide an estimate of the typical stellar mass for luminous @xmath3 lbgs based on a stacking analysis of the available multi - wavelength imaging data .",
    "in section 8 we use this information to derive an estimate of the stellar mass function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 and compare our results with the predictions of recent semi - analytic models of galaxy formation . in section 9",
    "we summarise our main conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmology : @xmath38 kms@xmath39mpc@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the ultra deep survey ( uds ) is the deepest of five near - infrared surveys currently underway at the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) with the new wfcam imager ( casali et al .",
    "2007 ) which together comprise the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the uds covers an area of 0.8 square degrees centred on ra=02:17:48 , dec=@xmath4405:05:57 ( j2000 ) and is already the deepest , large area , near - infrared survey ever undertaken .",
    "the data utilized in this paper were taken from the first ukidss data release ( dr1 ; warren et al .",
    "2007 ) , which included @xmath36 imaging of the entire uds field to @xmath45 depths of @xmath46 ( 1.6diameter apertures ) .",
    "the ukidss dr1 became publicly available to the world - wide astronomical community in january 2008 and can be downloaded from the wfcam science archive .",
    "the uds field is covered by a wide variety of deep , multi - wavelength observations ranging from the x - ray through to the radio ( see cirasuolo et al .",
    "2008 for a recent summary ) .",
    "however , for the present study the most important multi - wavelength observations are the deep optical imaging of the field taken with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on subaru as part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sekiguchi et al .",
    "the optical imaging consists of 5 over - lapping suprime - cam pointings , and covers an area of @xmath47  square degrees .",
    "the whole field has been imaged in the @xmath48 filters , to typical @xmath45 depths of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( 1.6diameter apertures ) .",
    "the reduced optical imaging of the sxds is now publicly available and full details of the observations , data reduction and calibration procedures are provided in furusawa et al .",
    "the high - redshift galaxies investigated in this study were selected from a contiguous area of 0.63 square degrees ( excluding areas contaminated by bright stars and ccd blooming ) covered by both the uds near - infrared and sxds optical imaging .",
    "one of the principle motivations for this study was to exploit the unique combination of areal coverage and optical+nearir data available in the uds / sxds to study the high - redshift galaxy population without recourse to strict dropout / lbg selection criteria .",
    "the reasoning behind this is to allow the luminosity function to be studied over a relatively wide range of redshifts from a single sample , and to reduce as much as possible the strong bias towards young , blue star - forming galaxies inherent to traditional lyman - break selection .",
    "although single - colour selection techniques ( e.g. @xmath54-drop , @xmath55drop ) have proven to be highly successful at isolating high - redshift galaxies , because of the need to adopt fairly strict colour - cut criteria ( e.g. @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) , it is at least possible that a significant population of old / redder , perhaps more massive , galaxies which marginally fail to satisfy these strict criteria could be excluded ( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "2007 ; rodighiero et al . 2007 ) .    consequently , from the outset",
    "the decision was taken to make the initial selection criteria as simple and inclusive as possible , and to then use a photometric redshift analysis to both define the final high - redshift galaxy sample and to exclude likely low - redshift interlopers . within this context ,",
    "the original sample for this study was a @xmath58band selected catalog covering the @xmath59 square - degree area uniformly covered by the subaru optical and uds near - infrared data , produced with version 2.5.2 of the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the original catalog was then reduced to @xmath60 objects by adopting a @xmath58band magnitude limit of @xmath61 , which corresponds to the @xmath62 detection threshold ( @xmath63 diameter apertures ) and the @xmath64% completeness limit .",
    "in addition , the only other selection criterion applied was the exclusion of all objects which were detected in the @xmath65band at more than @xmath66 significance .",
    "this criterion was adopted in order to exclude the vast majority of galaxies which are simply too bright in the @xmath65band to be robust high - redshift candidates ; given that the lyman - limit at @xmath67 is redshifted out of the suprime - cam @xmath65band filter at a redshift of @xmath68 .    following the application of the initial selection criteria the parent sample of potential high - redshift galaxies consisted of @xmath69 candidates in the apparent @xmath58band magnitude range @xmath70 .",
    "due to the decision not to apply strict drop - out criteria in our initial selection , in principle , this sample should contain _ all _ galaxies with @xmath37 lying between @xmath68 ( when the lyman limit [ @xmath67 ] is redshifted out of the @xmath65band ) and @xmath71 ( when lyman alpha [ @xmath72 ] is redshifted out of the @xmath73-band ) . however , given that the primary selection is performed in the rest - frame uv , it is clear that the sample is still biased against objects with significant levels of intrinsic reddening .      the next stage in the analysis was to process each of the potential high - redshift candidates with our own photometric redshift code .",
    "the photometric redshift code is an extended version of the publicly available hyperz package ( bolzonella , miralles & pell 2000 ) and is described in more detail by cirasuolo et al .",
    "however , briefly , the code fits a wide range of different galaxy sed templates to the available multi - wavelength ( @xmath74 ) photometry of each candidate , returning a best - fitting value of redshift , sed type , age , mass and reddening .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that for calculating the photometric redshifts , and the final luminosity function estimates , the @xmath63 diameter magnitudes were corrected to total using point - source corrections in the range @xmath75@xmath76 magnitudes ( depending on the seeing of the @xmath74 images ) .",
    "the primary set of stellar population models we adopted were those of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , with solar metallicity and assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with a lower and upper mass cutoff of 0.1 and 100 @xmath77 respectively .",
    "both instantaneous burst and exponentially declining star formation models  with e - folding times in the range @xmath78  were included , with the restriction that the sed models did not exceed the age of the universe at the best - fitting redshift .",
    "the code accounts for dust reddening by following the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obscuration law within the range @xmath79 , and accounts for lyman series absorption due to the hi clouds in the inter galactic medium according to the madau ( 1995 ) prescription .    based on the results of the photometric redshift analysis ,",
    "8% of the sample was excluded because it was not possible to find an acceptable @xmath80 fit ( at the @xmath81 level ) with a galaxy sed template at any redshift .",
    "the vast majority of these objects were spurious artifacts on the @xmath73-band images which had contaminated the original catalog .",
    "however @xmath82% of the excluded contaminants with @xmath83 had @xmath84 colours consistent with ultra - cool galactic stars .",
    "following the photometric redshift analysis our sample consisted of 1621 high - redshift galaxy candidates with primary redshift solutions at @xmath85 , and 4350 objects with primary redshift solutions at @xmath86 .",
    "however , due to the problem of multiple redshift minima which is inherent to photometric redshift techniques , when computing the luminosity function is it clearly not optimal to simply exclude the majority of candidates with primary redshift solutions at @xmath86 . indeed , even for candidates which have well defined primary redshift solutions at @xmath85 , it is often the case that a plausible secondary redshift solution exists at lower redshift ; and vice - versa .",
    "the simple reason is that , within the constraints of the available photometry , it is often statistically impossible to cleanly differentiate between a high - redshift lyman - break solution and a competing , low - redshift , @xmath87 - break solution at @xmath31 . therefore , during the derivation of the luminosity functions presented in section 5 , each candidate ( including those with primary redshift solutions at @xmath86 ) was represented by its normalised probability density function @xmath88 , which satisfied the condition : @xmath89 in addition to making better use of the available information , this methodology immediately deals with the problem of multiple redshift solutions in a natural and transparent fashion .",
    "armed with a normalised probability density function for each high - redshift candidate , it is possible to construct their luminosity function using the classic @xmath90 maximum likelihood estimator of schmidt ( 1968 ) .",
    "therefore , within a given redshift interval ( @xmath91 ) , the luminosity function estimate within a given absolute magnitude bin was calculated as follows : @xmath92 where the summation runs over the full sample , and @xmath93 is the redshift range within which a candidate s absolute magnitude lies within the magnitude bin in question .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 is a correction factor which accounts for incompleteness , object blending and contamination from objects photometrically scattered into the sample from faint - ward of the @xmath58band magnitude limit .",
    "the corrections for sample incompleteness and object blending were calculated by adding thousands of randomly placed point - sources into the @xmath58band images and recovering them with sextractor using the same extraction parameters adopted for the original object catalogues .",
    "the results of this procedure revealed that the @xmath58band images are 100% complete at @xmath34 and fall to 80% complete at the adopted @xmath61 magnitude limit .",
    "in addition , this process also demonstrated that it is necessary to correct for a constant @xmath95% of objects which are missed from the object catalogues due to blending with nearby objects on the crowded suprime - cam images .      in this study",
    "we adopt @xmath61 as our limiting magnitude , which corresponds to the @xmath96 detection limit .",
    "this fact , combined with the steepness of the luminosity function in the region we are exploring ( see fig .",
    "1 ) means that the prospect of contamination of the faint end of our sample from objects photometrically up - scattered from below the flux limit has to be considered carefully . in order to quantify this effect",
    "it is necessary to rely on simulation . in outline ,",
    "the adopted procedure was to produce a realistic simulated population of lbgs in the redshift interval @xmath97 , based on a known model for the evolving luminosity function .",
    "the simulated photometry for this population was then passed through the same initial selection criteria and photometric redshift analysis as employed on the real data . the average effect on the faint end of our luminosity function determination",
    "could then be calculated by running many monte - carlo realisations of the simulated lbg population .    in order to make the simulated lbg population as realistic as possible we based our model for the evolving luminosity function on the schechter function fits to the latest determination of the uv - selected luminosity functions centred on @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . over the full redshift range",
    "the adopted model had a fixed normalisation ( @xmath101 mpc@xmath17 ) , a fixed faint - end slope ( @xmath102 ) and an evolving characteristic magnitude parameterised as : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is calculated at a rest - frame wavelength of 1500 ( which corresponds to the middle of the @xmath58filter for an object at @xmath9 ) .",
    "although simple , this parameterisation nonetheless closely reproduces the bouwens et al .",
    "( 2007 ) luminosity function fits over the redshift range of interest .",
    "more importantly , this model should provide an accurate prediction of the relative numbers of objects just above and just below our adopted magnitude limit , the region in which our sample is most vulnerable to potential contamination from photometric scatter .",
    "this parameterisation of the evolving luminosity function was used to populate the redshift@xmath44magnitude plane using bin sizes of @xmath105 and @xmath106 . within each redshift",
    "bin the luminosity function was integrated down to an absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath107 , one magnitude fainter than our adopted magnitude limit .",
    "in addition to its absolute magnitude and redshift , each simulated lbg was allocated @xmath108 photometry based on an appropriate model sed drawn randomly from a distribution of parameter values ( i.e. age , reddening , metallicity ) representative of those displayed by the real lbg sample .",
    "appropriate photometric errors were then calculated for the synthetic photometry in each filter , according to the average depths of the real data .",
    "the final stage of the process involved the use of monte - carlo simulation whereby , in each realisation , the photometry of each candidate was randomly perturbed according to its photometric errors .",
    "the perturbed photometry of the synthetic lbg sample was then passed through our initial optical selection criteria to establish the number of objects which would have been included in our sample .",
    "the final result of this process was a finely sampled grid of correction factors which accounted for the fraction of the objects scattered into , and out of , the sample as a function of redshift and apparent @xmath58band magnitude .    in terms of the estimated luminosity functions presented in section 5",
    ", this simulation process demonstrated that photometric up - scatter from below the magnitude limit has a relatively minor effect .",
    "as would be anticipated , the effect is most pronounced on the two faintest absolute magnitude bins in the @xmath9 and @xmath12 luminosity function estimates .",
    "however , even here the effect is only to increase the volume density by @xmath109% and @xmath110% respectively .",
    "the luminosity function estimates shown in fig .",
    "1 are corrected for this effect .",
    "following the procedures outlined in the previous two sections , the uv - selected luminosity functions were estimated in two redshift intervals centred on @xmath9 and @xmath12 . for the @xmath9 luminosity function we considered the redshift range @xmath111 and for the @xmath12 luminosity function we considered the redshift range @xmath112 .",
    "these redshift ranges were chosen to be wide enough to include sufficient numbers of objects to provide a robust measurement of the bright end of the luminosity function , and narrow enough to limit the evolution of the luminosity function across each bin .",
    "the resulting estimates of the luminosity functions at @xmath9 and @xmath12 are shown in fig . 1",
    ".    the advantages provided by the large area and deep optical+nearir data available in the uds / sxds are immediately obvious from fig .",
    "1 . as a result of the current data - set covering an area of 0.63 square degrees , it has been possible to robustly estimate the bright end of the luminosity function to absolute magnitudes as bright as @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath9 and @xmath12 respectively . a second obvious feature of fig . 1 is the significant evolution in the bright end of the luminosity function within the @xmath3 redshift interval ; as previously demonstrated by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . from the data presented in fig .",
    "1 it is tempting to assume that this evolution is due entirely to a change in @xmath104 between @xmath9 and @xmath12 ( a shift of @xmath115 magnitudes results in excellent agreement between the two luminosity functions ) . in fact , based on our data - set alone , it is not possible to determine whether the apparent evolution is due entirely to a change in @xmath104 , or whether significant evolution in the normalisation ( @xmath116 ) is also occurring .",
    "however , the differential change in galaxy number density as a function of absolute magnitude does provide some information on the form of the luminosity function evolution .",
    "for example , while the number density of @xmath117 galaxies only decreases by a factor of @xmath118 between @xmath9 and @xmath12 , the number density of @xmath114 galaxies decreases by a factor of @xmath119 . in terms of schechter function parameters , it is not possible to reproduce this change in luminosity function shape through evolution of @xmath116 alone , and immediately confirms that some evolution of @xmath104 must be taking place .",
    "an attempt to quantify the relative contribution of evolution in @xmath104 and @xmath116 is pursued in section 5.2 .      before proceeding to explore the evolution of the luminosity function from @xmath9 to @xmath12 further , it is worthwhile comparing our results with those of recent studies in the literature .",
    "the @xmath19 luminosity function has been investigated by several recent studies using both ground - based and hst imaging ( e.g. ouchi et al .",
    "2004 ; yoshida et al . 2006",

    "however , the survey area covered by this work is a factor of @xmath118 larger than that of the shimasaku study , so it is likely that the apparent off - set is simply due to a combination of statistical errors and cosmic variance .",
    "although the results of the present study provide much improved constraints on the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath12 and @xmath9 , they do not reach faint enough to constrain the normalisation or faint - end slope of the @xmath35 luminosity function .",
    "consequently , in this section we explore the possibility of providing an improved measurement of the evolution of the luminosity function between @xmath9 and @xmath12 by combining our results with those of the hst - based study of bouwens et al .",

    "( 2007 ) to derive schechter function fits to the luminosity function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 based on data spanning a factor of @xmath141 in luminosity .",
    "the adopted procedure was to use a maximum likelihood technique to fit a schechter function to a finely sampled grid on the apparent @xmath58band magnitude @xmath44 redshift plane @xmath142 . to fit the luminosity function at @xmath9",
    "the grid was populated within the redshift interval @xmath143 and the apparent @xmath58band magnitude range @xmath144 . in the magnitude range",

    "the fitting procedure was to maximise the following likelihood function : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the number of galaxies in cell @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the probability of finding a galaxy within cell @xmath150 given the choice of model parameters . in this context , the probability @xmath151 is naturally defined as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the predicted number of galaxies within cell @xmath150 , for a given set of model parameters , and @xmath154 is the corresponding integrated luminosity function .",
    "the best - fitting schechter functions to the combined ground - based+hst data - sets at @xmath9 and @xmath12 are shown as the solid curves in fig .",
    "the best - fitting schechter function parameters and their associated uncertainties are reported in table 1 , and the @xmath155 and @xmath81 confidence regions around the best - fitting values of the faint - end slope and characteristic magnitude are plotted in  fig .  5 .",

    "4 that a schechter function provides a good description of luminosity function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 over the full luminosity range ( @xmath156 magnitudes ) sampled by the combined ground - based+hst data - set .",
    "a comparison of the best - fitting schechter function parameters derived here ( table 1 ) with those reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2007 ) shows that , at both redshifts , our best - fitting parameters are within the @xmath157 uncertainties reported by the earlier study . with respect to the faint - end slope and normalisation",
    "this is unsurprising , given that the constraints on these two parameters are largely provided by the deeper hst imaging data .",
    "however , the principle advantage provided by fitting the combined data - set is the improved constraints on the value of @xmath158 ; particularly at @xmath12 .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath158 dims by @xmath159 magnitudes between @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",

    "we have adopted the redshift distribution for our sample as derived from integrating over the redshift probability density functions for those objects with primary photometric redshift solutions in the interval @xmath163 .",
    "the correlation length can then be evaluated by fixing the slope of the correlation function to @xmath175 .",
    "this calculation produces a measurement of @xmath176mpc for the correlation length and a value of @xmath177 for the linear bias .",
    "although we consider this to be our best estimate of the clustering properties of the sample , we note that if we instead adopt the redshift distribution based on the best - fitting photometric redshifts alone ( @xmath178 ; see fig a2 ) we derive slightly higher , although consistent , values of @xmath179mpc and @xmath180 for the correlation length and linear bias respectively .",

    "there are several features of fig .",
    "7 which are worthy of comment .",
    "firstly , in the stack of the @xmath65band photometry the lbg candidates are robustly non - detected ( @xmath195 ; @xmath157 ) , as expected from our initial selection criteria .",
    "secondly , it can be seen that there is a faint detection in the stacked @xmath129band data .",
    "however , the @xmath129band detection is very faint ( @xmath196 ) and is expected given that the lyman - limit does not pass out of the subaru suprime - cam @xmath129filter until @xmath197 .",
    "finally , the two panels on the lower right of fig . 7 show the results of stacking the available spitzer irac data at @xmath198 m and @xmath199 m from the swire survey ( lonsdale et al .",
    "although relatively shallow , the swire data is deep enough to produce detections at @xmath198 m and @xmath199 m in the median stack .",
    "together with the robust photometry from the stacked @xmath200 imaging data , it is the extra wavelength coverage provided by the detections at @xmath198 m and @xmath199 m which will allow us to place useful constraints on the typical stellar mass of the @xmath3 lbgs .      using the same procedure as described in section 3.1 , the best - fitting galaxy template to the stacked photometry",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen from the lower panel of fig . 8",
    "that the fit to the stacked photometry provides a robust redshift solution at @xmath201 and that any alternative low - redshift solution is securely ruled out .",
    "the best - fitting sed template has an age of 400 myrs , consistent with a typical formation redshift of @xmath202 , and no intrinsic reddening ( @xmath203 ) . by considering the range of sed templates which provide an acceptable fit to the stacked photometry",
    ", we calculate that the stellar mass of the lbg stack is @xmath15 ( salpeter imf ) .",
    "although the uncertainties in the determination of the typical stellar and dark halo mass for the @xmath3 lbg sample are obviously large , combined with the results of the clustering analysis reported in the previous section , the sed fit to the stacked photometry suggests that the typical dark matter to stellar mass ratio for the @xmath3 lbgs is @xmath204 . given that our lbg sample are exclusively drawn from the bright end of the @xmath3 luminosity function it would seem reasonable to assume that they will evolve into objects occupying the high - mass end of the low - redshift galaxy stellar mass function ( i.e. @xmath205 ) . in which case , it is noteworthy that @xmath206 is in good agreement with the measured value for luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sdss from galaxy - galaxy lensing ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "moreover , @xmath206 is also in good agreement with the predicted mean value for low - redshift lrgs from recent semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. almeida et al .",

    "9 we show an estimate of the galaxy stellar mass function at @xmath3 based on combining the luminosity function fits presented in section 5 with the results of the stacking analysis presented in section 7 .",
    "the adopted procedure for estimating the stellar mass function is extremely straightforward .",
    "based on the schechter function fits to the luminosity function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 , we have estimated the corresponding stellar mass function by simply multiplying the luminosity function fits by the mass - to - light ratio derived from our sed fit to the stacked lbg imaging data . in fig .",

    "3 .   by combining our estimate of the bright end of the luminosity function with the corresponding estimates of the faint end by bouwens et al .

    "when deriving our estimates of the lbg luminosity functions at @xmath9 and @xmath12 in section 4 we employed several techniques which differ somewhat from those which have been commonly adopted in previous literature studies .",
    "consequently , it is perhaps instructive to investigate what influence these techniques have on the derived luminosity function estimates . in this section",
    "we first investigate the influence of our completeness corrections , before proceeding to investigate the influence of our decision to make use of the full photometric redshift probability density function for each lbg candidate .",
    "as previously discussed in section 4 , to estimate the lbg luminosity function at @xmath9 and @xmath12 we used the @xmath90 maximum likelihood estimator of schmidt ( 1968 ) , adapted to incorporate the photometric redshift probability density function of each lbg candidate .",
    "consequently , within a given redshift interval ( @xmath91 ) , our estimate of the luminosity function within a given absolute magnitude bin was : @xmath92 where the summation runs over the full sample , and @xmath93 is the redshift range within which a candidate s absolute magnitude lies within the magnitude bin in question . as described in detail in section 4 , the quantity @xmath94 is a correction factor derived from realistic monte - carlo simultions of the evolving lbg population , and accounts for sample incompleteness , object blending and contamination from objects photometrically scattered into the sample from faint - ward of the @xmath58band magnitude limit .    to illustrate the influence of the correction factor we show in fig a1 our estimates of the @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath12 lbg luminosity functions with and without the inclusion of @xmath94 . in fig a1",
    "the open and filled black symbols are the estimates of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 luminosity functions including the correction factor ( identical to the estimates displayed in fig 1 ) , while the grey symbols are the equivalent estimates setting @xmath227 .",
    "it can be seen from fig a1 that the correction factor does not have a significant impact on the shape of the luminosity function estimates . at the bright end , where our sample is most complete , the off - set between the black and grey data - points",
    "is simply due to the @xmath95% correction for objects lost due to blending in the crowded subaru images . in the faintest absolute magnitude",
    "bins the inclusion of the correction factor boosts the number densities by a roughly constant factor of @xmath228% ( 0.1 dex ) .",
    "this effect is due to a balance between the increasing positive correction that has to be made for incompleteness as the data approach the @xmath61 magnitude limit , and the increasingly negative correction that has to be made for objects photometrically scattered into the sample from faint - ward of the magnitude limit .      when deriving our estimates of the lbg luminosity functions at @xmath9 and @xmath12 in section 4 we used the full photometric redshift probability density functions provided by our sed template fitting code in order to make full use of the available information .",
    "in this section we investigate the influence of this technique on the derived luminosity function estimates .",
    "of particular interest is to investigate how the derived luminosity function estimates change if we simply treat the best - fitting photometric redshift for each lbg as unique , and ignore the possibility of secondary redshift solutions .",
    "the first straightforward comparison of the two techniques is to compare the estimated redshift distributions . in fig a2",
    "we show the lbg redshift distributions in the three redshift intervals utilised in this paper : @xmath143 , @xmath163 and @xmath147 .",
    "the redshift distributions shown in the left - hand column are derived by treating the best - fitting photometric redshift for each lbg as unique and robust .",
    "the redshift distributions shown in the right - hand column are derived by integrating over the full redshift probability density functions as done in section 4 .",
    "the number of objects included in each redshift distribution is listed in the top right - hand corner of each panel .",
    "although the redshift distributions derived via both techniques are broadly similar , it can be seen from fig a2 that they do differ in detail .",
    "perhaps the most noticeable difference is that adopting the best - fitting photometric redshifts alone predicts @xmath140% more objects in the highest redshift interval ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "armed with this information we now proceed to investigate how the differences in redshift distributions affect the estimated luminosity functions .      in fig a3 we show estimates for the bright end of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 lbg luminosity functions .",
    "the left - hand panels show the estimates derived in section 4 by adopting the photometric redshift probability density function for each lbg .",
    "the right - hand panels show the luminosity function estimates derived from simply adopting the best - fitting photometric redshift for each source . in each panel",
    "we also plot the maximum likelihood schechter function fits to the lbg luminosity function at either @xmath9 or @xmath12 as derived in section 5.2 .",
    "it can be seen from fig a3 that the estimate of the @xmath9 luminosity function is virtually identical using both techniques .",
    "this is as expected given the similarity of the @xmath143 redshift distributions shown in the top panel of fig a2 , and demonstrates that the photometric redshifts at @xmath19 are sufficiently robust that both techniques lead to indistinguishable conclusions .",
    "in contrast , although the two luminosity function estimates at @xmath12 are clearly consistent , there are differences in detail .",
    "specifically , it can be seen from fig a3 that the luminosity function estimate based on the best - fitting photometric redshifts predicts more objects in the three faintest absolute magnitude bins .",
    "this effect is entirely consistent with the differences between the @xmath147 redshift distributions shown in fig a2 , which demonstrate that using the best - fitting photometric redshifts alone predicts @xmath140% more objects at @xmath20 .    in conclusion",
    ", it is clear from the information displayed in figs a2 & a3 that the only substantive difference between the two techniques is for the faintest lbgs at @xmath20 .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected , given that these are the very objects for which the best - fitting photometric redshifts are least robust , and was the primary motivation for exploiting the extra information contained within the full redshift probability density function for each object .",
    "however , the good agreement between the luminosity function estimate shown in the bottom right panel of fig a3 and the best - fitting schechter function derived in section 5.2 confirms that adopting either technique would lead to the same conclusions regarding the form , and evolution , of the lbg luminosity function between @xmath9 and @xmath12 ."
