    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a principal parameter for formation and evolution of star clusters and galaxies .",
    "therefore , it has long been discussed observationally and theoretically whether and how the imf could vary with physical conditions of star - forming clouds in galaxies ( e.g. , larson 1998 ; chabrier 2003 ; elmegreen 2007 ; bastian et al . 2010 ; kroupa 2012 ) .",
    "one of important recent observational discoveries regarding the possible imf variation in galaxies is that the imf in massive elliptical galaxies could be bottom - heavy for low - mass stars ( e.g. , van dokkum & conroy 2010 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 , cv12 ; smith et al . 2012 ; spiniello et al .",
    "2012 ; ferreras et al . 2013 ) .",
    "recent observational studies of early - type galaxies have also revealed a possible correlation between the imf slope and galaxy properties such as velocity dispersions and chemical abundances ( e.g. , cenarro et al .",
    "2003 ; cappellari et al . 2012 ; cv12 ; ferreras et al .",
    "it is , however , theoretically unclear what physical mechanisms are behind the observed correlations between the imf and physical properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "cv12 have investigated the spectral absorption lines in early - type galaxies in order to provide strong constraints on imfs of the galaxies by using their updated population synthesis model . they have found that the imf for low - mass stars becomes increasingly bottom - heavy with increasing velocity dispersions ( @xmath11 ) and [ mg / fe ] in the 38 early - type galaxies .",
    "although they have found no strong correlations of the imf with total metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) , it could be possible that there exists a weak / marginal imf - metallicity correlation .",
    "these results lead the authors to suggest that total metallicity is not a key factor which determines the imf slope for low - mass stars .",
    "cv12 have also derived the particular three - part ( kroupa ) imf that can best match the observed spectral indices and thereby inferred @xmath7 ( i.e. , they did not directly measure @xmath7 ) .",
    "cv12 have shown a strong correlation of @xmath12-band mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath13 ) normalized to the mw value ( ( @xmath14 ) with [ mg / fe ] and briefly discussed the origin of the correlation .",
    "the origin of the observed @xmath15}$ ] correlation has not been extensively investigated by theoretical studies of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "narayanan & dav ( 2012 ) have adopted a broken power - law imf with fixed slopes yet variable break - mass depending on star formation rates and thereby investigated the imf evolution of elliptical galaxies in cosmological simulations .",
    "they have found that @xmath13 can be larger for more massive elliptical galaxies with higher central velocity dispersions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "although the simulated @xmath16 correlation derived by narayanan & dav ( 2012 ) is consistent qualitatively with the observed one by cv12 , the simulated slope is too shallow to be consistent quantitatively with the observed one .",
    "furthermore their imf model with a fixed slope and no dependence of the slope on [ fe / h ] appears to be inconsistent with recent observational results which have shown different imf slopes in different galaxies and a dependence of the imf slope on [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , geha et al .",
    "this apparent inconsistency suggests that we need to search for a better imf model that can explain both ( i ) the observed bottom - heavy imf of elliptical galaxies and ( ii ) the observed dependences of imf slopes on physical properties ( e.g. , [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] ) of galaxies .",
    "recently weidner et al . (",
    "2013 ) have pointed out that a time - independent bottom - heavy imf can not explain the observed metallicities of elliptical galaxies and suggested a two - stage formation scenario .",
    "marks et al . ( 2012 , m12 ) have recently proposed a variable kroupa imf model with the three imf slopes , @xmath0 ( for @xmath17 ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) . in their model ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on [ fe / h ] whereas @xmath2 depends on [ fe / h ] and gas densities ( @xmath3 ) of star - forming gas clouds .",
    "their model is promising , firstly because their model is derived from a detailed comparison between theoretical and observational results of globular cluster properties , and secondly because the model can naturally explain recent observational results on the positive correlation of @xmath1 with [ fe / h ] in galaxies with a wide range of velocity dispersions and metallicities ( geha et al .",
    "furthermore , recent numerical simulations with the variable kroupa imf model by m12 have shown that the observed correlation between star formation rate densities and the slope of the high - mass end of the imf ( @xmath2 ) can be naturally reproduced ( bekki & meurer 2013 ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the proposed imf with a variable slope @xmath1 by m12 ( i.e. , @xmath20}$ ] ) can not simply explain the observed strong @xmath21}$ ] correlation yet no / little correlation between @xmath22 and metallicities ( @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] ) in elliptical galaxies ( @xmath0 is assumed to be @xmath24 in the present study so that @xmath1 can be a sole key parameter for the imf of low - mass stars in galaxies ) . furthermore , observational support for the proposed dependence of @xmath1 on [ fe / h ] is significantly weaker in comparison with @xmath2 in m12 .",
    "these facts imply that the variable imf model by m12 needs to be modified significantly by considering possible dependences of @xmath1 on other physical properties of star - forming gas clouds , such as gas densities @xmath3 , temperature ( @xmath25 ) , and pressure ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus it is particularly important for theoretical studies to investigate how @xmath1 in the variable kroupa imf needs to depend on physical properties of star - forming clouds so that the observed bottom - heavy imf and its correlation with galaxy properties can be self - consistently explained .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how @xmath1 should depend on physical properties of star - forming gas clouds within galaxies so that the observed positive correlation between @xmath1 and [ mg / fe ] in elliptical galaxies can be quantitatively reproduced .",
    "we adopt one - zone chemical evolution models of elliptical galaxy formation with a more generalized version of the variable kroupa imf in m12 and thereby search for the best imf model that can explain the observed @xmath1-[mg / fe ] correlation .",
    "we compare the spectroscopically inferred @xmath12-band @xmath7 ( normalized to the mw value ) with the simulated one in order to derive the best functional form of @xmath1 ( @xmath27},\\rho_{\\rm g})$ ] ) . in the present study , we consider that observational results on the @xmath21}$ ] ( or @xmath28}$ ] ) correlation by cv12 , which do not show strong correlations between @xmath1 and metallicities , can be used for determining the best variable kroupa imf model .",
    "however , cenarro et al . ( 2003 ) reported a correlation between the imf slope and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) in elliptical galaxies .",
    "if we use the results by cenarro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) as a constraint on the functional form of @xmath1 , then the best imf model would be quite different from the one that we can determine by using the @xmath21}$ ] correlation as a constraint . therefore , it should be noted that the choice of the best variable imf model can depend on which observational results are used as a constraint on the functional form of the imf .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe our new one - zone chemical evolution models with a variable imf model . in  3 , we present the results of the time evolution of @xmath1 , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] for models with different parameters . in this section",
    ", we show the best variable kroupa imf model that can reproduce observations by cv12 . in  4 , we discuss imf - related observational results that appear to be inconsistent with a bottom - heavy imf in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are given in  5 .",
    "we mainly focus on correlations between imf slopes and chemical properties of galaxies , and accordingly do not discuss recent observational results on the mass - to - light ratios of early - type galaxies which suggest a non - universal imf ( e.g. , treu et al .",
    "2010 ) in the present study .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to compare the observed and modeled @xmath29}$ ] relations .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that cv12 derived @xmath7 of elliptical galaxies from the gravity - sensitive spectral features by adopting a variable kroupa imf ( with fixed @xmath2 yet variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 in cv12 is not a direct measurement of @xmath7 and it can depend on the modeling of imf .",
    "we however compare the observationally inferred @xmath7 by cv12 with the modeled ones in order to derive physical meanings of the observed @xmath29}$ ] relation .",
    "also , as described later , a number of assumptions are made in deriving @xmath7 of elliptical galaxies from chemical evolution models .",
    "thus , there are some limitations both in inferring @xmath7 from the observed spectral features in cv12 and in modeling @xmath7 in the present study .",
    "we need to derive both [ mg / fe ] and @xmath7 by using the present one - zone chemical evolution model and a publicly available stellar population synthesis code . although it is straightforward to calculate [ mg / fe ] in the present one - zone model , we need to take the following steps to estimate @xmath7",
    ". first we derive @xmath1 ( and @xmath30 ) of a galaxy by using the adopted variable kroupa imf that depends on gas densities and [ fe / h ] in one - zone chemical evolution models",
    ". then we estimate the mean @xmath7 of old stellar populations of the galaxy from the derived @xmath1 ( that is integrated over all time steps ) .",
    "it would be ideal that we adopt a fully self - consistent one - zone model with chemical yields depending on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 at each time step and use a stellar population synthesis code to calculate @xmath7 of old stellar populations with different kroupa imf slopes . however , most of stellar population synthesis codes are for a fixed imf ( but see conroy et al .",
    "2009 for a new model with a variable kroupa imf ) and we have not yet developed one - zone chemical evolution models with variable kroupa imfs .",
    "therefore , we have to adopt the following two approximations as a compromise .",
    "one is that chemical yields do not depend on @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) in the present one - zone models in which @xmath1 is assumed to vary with time .",
    "this approximation can be justified as follows .",
    "chemical yields from supernovae and agb stars depend much more strongly on @xmath2 than on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . therefore , the inclusion of time - varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 in one - zone chemical evolution models would not change significantly the present results .",
    "in order to demonstrate this point , we have investigated [ mg / fe]@xmath31[fe / h ] relations of elliptical galaxies with different @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( but fixed @xmath32 , like the salpeter imf ) in the variable kroupa imf and the results and their discussion are shown in appendix a. clearly , the final [ mg / fe ] does not depend strongly on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( but it depends more strongly on star formation time scales of galaxies ) . thus the adopted approximation can be regarded as good enough to discuss the final [ mg / fe ] of galaxies .",
    "the other is that @xmath7 predicted for a single - power - law imf rather than @xmath7 for a ( variable / fixed ) kroupa imf is used for estimating @xmath7 of a galaxy .",
    "the adoption of this approximation means that the present model is not self - consistent ( i.e. , using a stellar population synthesis code based on a variable single - power - law imf for chemical evolution models with a variable kroupa imf ) .",
    "however , this is the best that we can do , because most of publicly available stellar population synthesis codes are for a fixed imf and we have used them so far . in order to demonstrate whether this approximation is good enough to discuss @xmath7 , we have investigated possible @xmath7 difference in single - power - law and variable kroupa imfs with different @xmath1 and the results are shown in appendix b.    it is clear in appendix b that ( i ) the absolute values of @xmath7 can be slightly different between single - power - law ( @xmath33 ) and variable kroupa ( @xmath30 ) imfs for a given @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) and ( ii ) the @xmath7 difference does not depend strongly on @xmath1 .",
    "these mean that single - power - law imfs are highly likely to overestimate @xmath7 by a similar amount in comparison with the variable kroupa imfs ( with the same @xmath2 ) for a wide range of @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these accordingly demonstrate that the slope of the @xmath29}$ ] relation modeled in the present study ( in which a stellar population synthesis code for a variable single - power - law imf is adopted ) can be very close to the true one that is derived self - consistently by using a stellar population synthesis code for a variable kroupa imf .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the observed and modeled slopes can be regarded as reasonable",
    ". it should be noted , however , that @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the imf adopted by cv12 can vary independently ( @xmath35 ) and therefore their imf is different from ours in which @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the present model is not fully self - consistent in terms of the derivation of @xmath7 from the outputs of one - zone chemical evolution models owing to the adoption of the above two approximations .",
    "however , as long as we discuss the slope of the observed @xmath29}$ ] relation , the present model greatly helps us to extract some important physical meanings of the observed @xmath29}$ ] relation",
    ". we will be able to more properly estimate @xmath7 in our future studies by adopting the latest stellar population synthesis code for any combinations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 of a variable kroupa imf ( e.g. , conroy et al .",
    "we consider that the main conclusion of this paper ( i.e. , @xmath1 should be proportional to @xmath36}+2\\log \\rho_{\\rm g}$ ] ) will not change significantly in our future better models , because the conclusion is derived from a comparison between the observed and modeled slopes of the @xmath29}$ ] relation ( not from a comparison between the observed and simulated absolute values of @xmath7 themselves ) .",

    "we consider that gas density is a more fundamental parameter for @xmath1 than sfr , because sfr can depend not only on gas density but also on other gas properties ( e.g. , molecular content and dynamical time scale ) .",

    "it should be noted here that the [ fe / h ] range of elliptical galaxies in cv12 is only 0.3 dex and thus corresponds to only 0.15 variation in @xmath1 ( for the derived relation of @xmath141}$ ] in geha et al .",

    "therefore , @xmath1 does not depend simply on [ fe / h ] for galaxies that can continue star formation beyond [ fe / h]@xmath145 .",

    "this is one of possible explanations for the observed different dependences of @xmath1 on [ fe / h ] between dwarfs and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "we need to investigate whether @xmath1 depends differently on [ fe / h ] between dwarfs and giant elliptical galaxies by using self - consistent chemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with a same variable imf model in our future study .",
    "greggio & renzini ( 2012 , gr12 ) convincingly discussed whether top - heavy / bottom - heavy imfs can really explain a number of key observed properties of elliptical galaxies _ in a self - consistent manner_. they clearly demonstrated that the canonical imf ( @xmath146 ) can better explain both ( i ) @xmath147-band mass - to - right ratios and their correlations with mean stellar ages observed in elliptical galaxies and ( ii ) oxygen and silicon mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively ) in clusters of galaxies .",
    "they furthermore showed that both bottom - heavy and top - heavy imfs fail to explain these observations by using some idealized models of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "then , how can we explain these two observations , if elliptical galaxies really have a bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars ?",
    "we provide a clue to this puzzling problem regarding the imf of elliptical galaxies as follows .",
    "since gr12 adopted a simple imf model with a single power - law slope in discussing the above imf problems , a bottom - heavy imf means bottom - heavy for both low - mass and high - mass stars . on the other hand , @xmath1 for low - mass stars and @xmath2 for",
    "high - mass stars can vary independently from each other in a variable kroupa imf model so that a bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars does not necessarily mean bottom - heavy for high - mass stars . as a result of this ,",
    "elliptical galaxies with bottom - heavy imfs for low - mass stars can have as high @xmath148 and @xmath149 as the canonical imf predicts , if @xmath2 is only slightly top - heavy .",
    "figure 8 shows the mass fraction of stars with @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) as a function of @xmath1 for five @xmath2 values .",
    "this @xmath151 can be used as a more accurate measure for @xmath148 and @xmath149 , because oxygen and silicon abundances come largely from type ii sne ( gr12 ) . in this simple model ,",
    "@xmath151 is 0.21 for the canonical imf with @xmath152 and @xmath151 at a given @xmath1 is lower for larger @xmath2 ( i.e. , more bottom - heavy ) .",
    "however , @xmath151 can be as high as 0.21 for @xmath153 even for @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the observed bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars is not inconsistent with the observed @xmath148 and @xmath149 , as long as the imf for high - mass stars is only slightly top - heavy .",
    "figure 8 also shows the mass fraction of low - mass stars with @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) as a function of @xmath1 for five @xmath2 values .",
    "if a galaxy is dominated by low - mass stars ( i.e. , higher @xmath155 ) , then the galaxy can have rather high @xmath156 ( gr12 ) .",
    "it is clear that the larger @xmath1 is , the higher @xmath155 is ( i.e. , more dwarf - dominated ) , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the model with a slightly top - heavy imf for high - mass stars ( @xmath157 ) can show @xmath155 at @xmath158 as low as @xmath159 estimated for the canonical imf with @xmath152 .",
    "this result means that even if the imf for low - mass stars is bottom - heavy , @xmath156 can not be so high ( i.e. , can not be dominated by low - mass dwarf stars ) , as long as the imf for high - mass stars is slightly top - heavy .",
    "this result suggests that the observed range of @xmath156 ( @xmath160 shown in gr12 ) in elliptical galaxies is not inconsistent with the observed bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars .",
    "thus it is possible that future models of elliptical galaxy formation with a variable kroupa imf can explain a number of observational results regarding the imf slopes in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "although elliptical galaxies with bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars and slightly top - heavy imf in high - mass stars might form , as the present study suggests , it is theoretically unclear why such a combination of bottom - heavy / top - heavy imfs is possible in a single star - forming gas cloud . elmegreen ( 2004 ) considered that different parts of the imf can be independently determined and thereby demonstrated that the entire imf can be constructed by using three log - normals , each of which has its own characteristic stellar mass .",
    "the shape of his multi - component imf model depends basically on the amplitudes of the three log - normals : it would be possible in principle that a certain combination of the three amplitudes can yield an imf with bottom - heavy @xmath1 and top - heavy @xmath2 .",
    "if we understand how the basic nine parameters determining the amplitudes of the three log - normals depend on physical properties of star - forming cloud , such as [ fe / h ] , interstellar radiation fields , @xmath3 , and @xmath26 , then we could better understand in what physical conditions of a star - forming cloud an imf with a bottom - heavy @xmath1 and a top - heavy @xmath2 is possible .",
    "thus extensive investigation on the dependences of the basic parameters of the imf on physical properties of star - forming gas clouds will greatly advance our understanding of the origin of the imf in elliptical galaxies .",

    "is suggested to be the truncation epoch of star formation for dwarfs and the time scale of star formation for giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is our future study to understand why gas density can be a fundamental parameter for @xmath1 .",
    "\\(3 ) the observed bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) in elliptical galaxies would not be a problem in explaining the observed @xmath148 and @xmath149 in galaxy clusters , as long as the variable kroupa imf for high - mass stars ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) is slightly more top - heavy .",
    "both the observed bottom - heavy imf and the cluster metal content ( for which the salpeter imf is suggested to be required ) could be self - consistently explained in a model in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 can vary independently from each other .",
    "\\(4 ) in the variable kroupa imf , the mass fraction of low - mass stars with @xmath164 ( @xmath155 ) depends on @xmath2 for a given @xmath1 such that @xmath155 can be lower for smaller @xmath2 . therefore , elliptical galaxies with @xmath4 ( i.e. , bottom - heavy ) can have @xmath155 as low as 0.44 estimated for the canonical imf with @xmath152 , if the imf for high - mass stars is only slightly top - heavy ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "this implies that the observed @xmath147-band mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath156 ) in elliptical galaxies are not inconsistent with a bottom - heavy imf for low - mass stars .",
    "a more detailed modeling with variable @xmath1 and @xmath2 is necessary to confirm that both the bottom - heavy @xmath1 and @xmath156 in elliptical galaxies can be self - consistently explained by a variable imf model .",

    "although the present study has adopted somewhat idealized models for elliptical galaxies formation , the formation processes are significantly more complicated in recent hierarchal galaxy formation models ( e.g. , naab 2012 ) .",
