    "the nature and structure of extragalactic magnetic fields are currently unknown . magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies and in bridges between clusters have been observed ( kim et al .",
    "1989 ; vallee 1990 ; kronberg 1994 and references therein ) but fields in cosmological scales are yet to be established .",
    "cosmological fields produced before galaxy formation would be present throughtout the universe today and could be detected by faraday rotation observations .",
    "a number of models for the generation of such primordial fields have been suggested ( e.g. , harrison 1969 , 1970 , 1973 ; hogan 1983 ; turner & widrow 1988 ; vachaspati 1991 ; quashnock , loeb , & spergel 1989 ; ratra 1992 ; enqvist & olesen 1993 ; dolgov & silk 1993 ; cheng & olinto 1994 ; kibble & vilenkin 1995 ; gasperini , giovannini , & veneziano 199 , lemoine & lemoine 1995 ; baym , bodecker , & mclerran 1996 ; sigl , olinto , & jedamzik 1997 ; joyce & shaposhnikov 1997 ; giovannini & shaposhnikov 1997 ) with hopes of seeding magnetic fields in galaxies . the evolution of these fields has been studied before ( jedamzik , katalinic , & olinto 1998 ; brandenburg , enqvist , & olesen 1997 ) and around recombination ( wasserman 1978 ; kim , olinto , & rosner 1996 ) but theoretical expectations for the present structure of these fields has not been contrasted with observations .",
    "here we take a first step in this direction by considering the effect of densities inhomogeneities in the present universe on faraday rotation measures and find much stronger limits on the primordial field than the previously assumed case of a homogeneous density distribution .    as early researchers realized ( rees & reinhardt 1972 ; nelson 1973 ; kronberg & simard - normandin 1976 ) , the most effective method for studying large scale magnetic fields is the detection of faraday rotation from extragalactic sources .",
    "faraday rotation occurs when polarized electromagnetic radiation travels through a magnetized medium .",
    "the polarization vector rotates an angle , @xmath11 , proportional to the magnetic field along the line - of - sight , @xmath12 , and varies with the observed wavelength as @xmath13 .",
    "the rotation measure is defined as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number density of electrons ( with charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the wavelength at a physical position @xmath19 along the line - of - sight to a source at physical distance @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the speed of light .",
    "this method has been quite sucessful in determining the structure of the galactic magnetic field by observing both rm and the dispersion measure of pulsar radio emission . with the dispersion measure data ,",
    "the electron number density can be estimated and a @xmath22 determined",
    ". for extragalactic sources , no dispersion measure data is attainable and the electron density has to be modeled theoretically .",
    "prior studies of extragalactic rm have generally used oversimplified models for the electron density distribution given what we presently know about the matter distribution in the universe .",
    "in fact , the electron density is usually assumed to be a homogeneous distribution that only scales with redshift , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 .",
    "instead , it has been clear for a number of years that the matter in the intergalactic medium is not homogeneously distributed",
    ". a new picture of the intergalactic medium has emerged in which the baryon fluctuations trace the dark matter fluctuations on scales larger than the jeans length ( cen et al .",
    "this picture fits well with high resolution spectroscopic observations of the ubiquitous high - redshift neutral hydrogen absorption clouds known as the lyman-@xmath0 forest ( kirkman & tylter 1997 , hu et al .",
    "1995 , lu et al . 1996 ) and with n - body+hydro simulations of large - scale structure formation ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 , zhang et al .",
    "1998 )    in this letter , we study the rm of distant qsos assuming that the electron distribution follows the observed lyman-@xmath0 forest distribution .",
    "we show that not only the variance and mean rm for different lines - of - sight can differ by more than an order of magnitude from the case of a homogeneous universe but their scatter is too large to determine a significant limit .",
    "the dependence on the cosmological magnetic field coherence scale is almost washed out becoming subdominant to the density fluctuations scale . to determine a limit , we use instead the @xmath1 and find that for @xmath25 and @xmath26 the cosmological field is @xmath27 g for coherence lengths varying from the jeans length to the horizon scale , @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , for cosmological fields coherent accross the present horizon , the case of a lyman-@xmath0 forest gives @xmath5 g which is stronger than the limit for a homogeneous universe , @xmath6 g ; while for 50 mpc coherence length , the inhomogeneous case gives @xmath7 g while the homogeneous limit is @xmath8 g and for coherence length equal to the jeans length , @xmath9 g for the lyman-@xmath0 case while @xmath10 g.",
    "for distant extragalactic sources , the integral in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written as an integral over redshift using the radial displacement - redshift relation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the proper displacement at redshift @xmath23 , @xmath31 is the present hubble parameter , @xmath32 is the ratio of the matter density to the critical density in the universe , and @xmath33 is the vacuum energy density over the critical density ( see , e.g. , peebles 1993 ) . following the usual choices for the cosmological parameters , we assume @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 below .",
    "( we have also considered the case of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which changes the result only by a factor @xmath39 . )",
    "the electron density along the line - of - sight to a qso depends on the mass distribution , the baryon fraction , and the ionization fraction .",
    "observations of the lyman-@xmath0 forest in qso spectra give evidence of the neutral hydrogen distribution along the line - of - sight which we assume to trace the bulk of the baryon distribution .",
    "given a value of the baryon number density over the critical , @xmath40 , we can model the electron distribution by assuming an ionization fraction .",
    "we assume that the bulk of the baryons is ionized hydrogen and helium ( 24% ) with an average density given by @xmath40 and that the spatial dependence of the baryon distribution ( hence , the electron distribution ) is the same as the neutral hydrogen distribution .    in modelling the intergalactic medium",
    ", we use the analytical approximation of a log - normal density distribution for the lyman-@xmath0 forest ( bi & davidsen 1997 , and coles & jones 1991 ) which gives a simple and consistent description of the observations .",
    "the log - normal distribution sets the baryon density fluctuations at the jeans length for photoionized clouds , @xmath41 , which can be written in comoving coordinates as ( gnedin & hui 1996 , bi & davidsen 1997 , and bond , szalay , & silk , 1988 ) : @xmath42    the log - normal distribution gives the electron density distribution as a function of one parameter , @xmath43 , which is the linear variance over the jeans length . for standard cdm ,",
    "a good fit to @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 while @xmath46cdm gives @xmath44 within 20% of standard cdm ( bi & davidsen , 1997 ) .",
    "we simulate 10,000 random lines - of - sight to high - redshift qsos by randomly drawing electron densities for cells given by the jeans length . for each jeans length cell",
    ", we calculate the electron over - density ( @xmath47 ) with the log - normal equation : @xmath48 ^ 2\\over { 2\\sigma^2}}\\right ) \\ , d\\delta \\ . \\label{pdelta}\\ ] ] the physical electron density is then given in terms of the over - density calculated above , @xmath49 where the mean electron density as a function of redshift , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we set @xmath52 from d / h measurements in high - redshift qso systems ( burles & tytler 1998a , 1998b ) together with the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( see , e.g. , copi , schramm , & turner 1995 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 independent of @xmath31 .",
    "we add the rotation measures contributed by each jeans length along the line - of - sight from the qso redshift to z=0 .",
    "in each cell , the rotation measure , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and can be related to @xmath56 through eq .",
    "we assume that the large scale magnetic field we are constraining predates the formation of structure and is considered frozen into the plasma .",
    "the conductivity of the plasma in the universe is large enough for the frozen in assumption to hold on scales @xmath57 1 a.u .",
    "( cheng & olinto , 1995 ) which is well below the scales of interest here . the field direction is then taken to be fixed between different magnetic field coherence lengths , @xmath58 , while the field magnitude changes as a function of the electron density . for simplicity , we assume that the overdensities are spherical on average and thus scale the field magnitude as @xmath59 .    therefore , the magnetic field projected along the line - of - sight , @xmath60 , is fixed within each cell to be @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the magnitude of the cosmological field in comoving coordinates ( actual value at @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 is the angle between the line - of - sight and the direction of the cosmological field .",
    "@xmath64 is chosen randomly for each magnetic field coherence length scale . for magnetic field coherence length , @xmath65 , the random angle of the field",
    "is chosen at each step , while for @xmath66 , the random direction is changed after @xmath67 steps .",
    "the coherence length for a given cosmological field depends on the particular magnetogenesis model and the evolution of the field up to recombination .",
    "given the damping of the short wavelength modes up to the silk scale ( jedamzik , katalinic , & olinto 1998 ) the coherence scale is likely to be above @xmath41 , which today is @xmath68 mpc .",
    "we chose to study three choices of @xmath58 that span the range of interest for plausible cosmological fields : @xmath41 , 50 mpc , and @xmath28 .",
    "as discussed below , our results are not very sensitive to the coherence length of the field and our conclusions can be applied to any model of magnetogenesis where @xmath69 .",
    "after integrating eq . ( 1 ) for 10,000 lines - of - sight per 0.1 redshift interval , we display our results in figs . 1 and 2 , where we plot the median of the absolute value of the rm ( @xmath70 , circles in fig .",
    "1 ) , the mean absolute value of rm ( @xmath71 , squares in fig .",
    "1 ) , and the variance ( @xmath72 , triangles in fig .",
    "2 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the same functions for the case of a homogeneous electron distribution throughout the universe ( @xmath73 are the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 , the @xmath71 are the dashed lines in fig . 1 , and",
    "the variance @xmath74 is the solid line in fig .",
    "we also bin the available data on qso rotation measures in two redshift bins , @xmath75 and @xmath76 and display the @xmath71 ( dashed - dotted line ) and the latexmath:[$median     not surprisingly we find that the lyman-@xmath0 forest introduces a very large scatter in the rm for different lines - of - sight .",
    "not only the magnitude of the variance is many orders of magnitude greater than the case of a homogeneous universe but the variance and the mean rm vary significantly within our unrealistically large simulated sample of 10,000 lines - of - sight per @xmath78 redshift interval ( fig .",
    "2 ) . with such a large variance ,",
    "the limited data set available at present is not sufficient to constrain well the cosmological magnetic field .",
    "in fact , oren & wolfe ( 1995 ) showed how sensitive is the redshift dependence of the variance to different binning procedures and how the observed distribution is non - gaussian .",
    "the trends in the variance as a function of redshift in fig .",
    "10 of oren & wolfe ( 1995 ) ( where they plot different binning of data compiled by welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 ) are incompatible with the variance behaviour in a homogeneous universe ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in particular , the homogeneous case has a monotonically increasing variance with redshift while the inhomogeneous case can reproduce the behaviour shown in their fig .",
    "10 . in this case",
    ", the non - gaussian tail of the rm is due to a few large density clouds along random lines - of - sight .",
    "the non - gaussian tail can also be due to non cosmological magnetic fields such as small scale structure unaccounted for in the galactic magnetic field .    of the statistical indicators we studied , the variance is the noisiest followed by the mean and the median is the most stable indicator .",
    "this behaviour is evident in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the fact that the mean and the mediam differ significantly in the case of an inhomogeneous universe is further evidence of the non - gaussian behaviour of the rotation measures .",
    "the mild magnetic coherence length dependence of the median and the mean , is such that as the coherence length grows the two indicators approach each other .",
    "we use the best statistical indicator , the @xmath70 , to set our limits for both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases .",
    "we only set limits versus detections due to the presently unsurmountable challenge of separating locally generated contributions to the rotation measure from cosmologically generated ones .",
    "the available date on qso rms is sparse and dominated by the galactic magnetic field contribution .",
    "courageous attempts at modelling and subtracting the galactic contribution can be found in simard - normandin & kronberg 1980 , simard - normandin , kronberg , & burton 1981 , kronberg & perry 19982 , welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 , watson & perry 1991 , valle 1990 , 1993 , and oren & wolfe 1995 .",
    "( for a critical comparison of these attempts see oren & wolfe 1995 . ) given the sparseness of the available data , we chose to bin the welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 catalog in two redshift bins ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) and calculated the mean absolute rm ( dashed - dotted line ) and the median absolute rm ( dotted line ) for this data and compared these with our predictions .",
    "for the @xmath26 flat universe ( with @xmath4 ) we get for cosmological fields coherent accross the present horizon , @xmath5 g in the case of a lyman-@xmath0 forest which is stronger than the limit for a homogeneous universe , @xmath6 g ; while for 50 mpc coherence length , the inhomogeneous case gives @xmath7 g while the homogeneous limit is @xmath8 g and for coherence length equal to the jeans length , @xmath9 g for the lyman-@xmath0 case while @xmath10 g. changing cosmological parameters to , for example , @xmath37,@xmath38 in a flat universe , the results only change by a factor of 1.6 ; we find @xmath81 ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) @xmath82 ( @xmath26,@xmath36 ) , and the limits on cosmological magnetic fields is 1.6 times lower .",
    "these limits are slightly stronger than limits attained by alternative methods . for instance , the limit due to the isotropy of the cosmic background radiation is @xmath83 g for @xmath84 and @xmath34 ( barrow , ferreira , silk 1997 ) . given the non - gaussian nature of the rm distribution , the sparseness of the data , and the difficult galactic subtraction , it is encouraging to find the rm limit for the largest coherence length to be consistent with and comparable to the cosmic background radiation limit .",
    "our results imply stronger constraints on scenarios of primordial magnetic field generation and evolution by limiting the spectrum of primordial fields today both the magnitude and the scale dependence , i.e. , we limit @xmath85 .",
    "this lowers the available primordial seed for galactic dynamos and for structure formation by primordial fields .",
    "our results also help the prospective of detectors pointing back to ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) sources , by limiting the primordial component of the intergalactic medium field .",
    "magnetic effects on uhecrs will be more important if post recombination fields , limited to sites of structure formation , are much stronger than the fossil fields from the early universe ( e.g. , ryu , kang , & biermann 1998 ) .",
