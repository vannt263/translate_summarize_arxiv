    "coronal holes ( chs ; @xcite ) are the regions on the sun , which appear dark in comparison to the quiet - sun ( qs ) because they emit less in uv @xmath5 x - rays and maintained at a lower temperature than the surroundings .",
    "the different magnetic structures of qs and ch are responsible for their different appearance in coronal lines @xcite .",
    "chs are dominated by coronal funnels , which originate from the adjoining locations of super - granule boundaries at the photosphere and expand abruptly towards higher atmosphere @xcite .",
    "qs regions are dominated by closed magnetic filed lines .",
    "although , qs has also the coronal funnels with less expansion .",
    "the filling factors of these coronal funnels are less in qs compared to chs .",
    "coronal funnels play an important role in the formation as well as propagation of nascent fast solar wind in the chs @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic analysis is important to understand the dynamics of the qs as well as ch .",
    "the doppler velocity , which provides important information to any model of solar coronal heating , has a tendency to invert from pre - dominant red - shifts ( _ i.e. _ , downflows ) to blue - shifts ( _ i.e. _ , upflows ) as we go higher from chromosphere to corona in chs @xcite as well as in qs @xcite .",
    "several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed red - shifts of the solar transition region ( tr ) and coronal lines , _",
    "e.g. _ , return of spicular material @xcite , downward propagating acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "the turnover temperature from red - shift to blue - shift is a crucial observational parameter for future modelling .",
    "full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) is also an important parameter to understand the dynamics of qs and ch .",
    "some observed solar extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and far - ltraviolet ( fuv ) spectral line profiles are found to be broader than those expected from thermal broadening @xcite .",
    "these excess widths , after subtracting thermal and instrumental widths from the observed widths , are called as non - thermal widths .",
    "non - thermal velocities as derived from these widths reveal the presence of non - thermal motions / unresolved flows or the presence of waves in the solar atmosphere .",
    "early studies show that the non - thermal velocities increase within a narrow range of temperature ( from chromosphere up to tr temperatures ) in the qs near disk centre @xcite ) . after the launch of solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) on board soho ,",
    "the non - thermal velocity has been investigated for a quite large range of solar atmosphere ( _ i.e. _ , 10@xmath6 k to 2@xmath110@xmath7 k ) .",
    "it is found that initially non - thermal velocity increases but after a certain temperature decreases corresponding to coronal heights in qs as well as active regions @xcite ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the pattern of non - thermal velocity through the solar atmosphere , _",
    "e.g. _ , mhd wave models or magnetic reconnection generated turbulence @xcite , unresolved laminar flows , waves and turbulent flows @xcite , alfvn waves @xcite , _ etc_.",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the non - thermal velocities represent strong distribution from 19 km s@xmath3 to 22 km s@xmath3 in the various parts of the solar atmosphere . in the present study , we have performed a comparison between qs and chs on the basis of various spectral parameters ( _ e.g. _ , doppler velocity , non - thermal width , _",
    "etc_. ) . on the basis of the variations of these parameters and density contrast",
    ", we have located the most probable regions of coronal funnels in qs .",
    "variation of the non - thermal velocity and average doppler velocity with temperature have also been investigated in qs by including some previous relevant results with our estimated values .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in section  [ s - data - analysis ] , we describe the details about the observation and data reduction .",
    "results related to the comparison between qs and ch as well as identification of the coronal funnels are presented in section  [ s - qs - ch ] .",
    "section  [ s - t - dv_ntv ] outlines the temperature dependent behaviour of non - thermal velocity in qs and ch .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "_ extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer _ ( eis ) on board _ hinode _ spacecraft is a normal - incidence euv spectrometer .",
    "eis has spatial resolution of @xmath0 2-arcsecond and high spectral resolution of 0.0223   per pixel .",
    "eis observes high resolution spectra in short wavelength band ( _ i.e. _ , 170 - 211  ) and long wavelength band ( _ i.e. _ , 246 - 292  ) .",
    "four types of slits / slots ( _ e.g._,1-,2-,40-,256-arcsecond ) are available in the eis observations @xcite .",
    "a north polar coronal hole ( npch ) observation captured on 10 october 2007 by _",
    "hinode_/eis , has been used in the present work .",
    "the observed region ( fov ) is marked as a white rectangular box on the soho / eit 195    image ( _ cf .",
    "_ , figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "npch was observed using the 2-arcsecond slit in the raster mode for more than four hours ( _ i.e. _ , from 14:03 ut to 18:17 ut ) by capturing 101 exposures with 155 s exposure time on each scanning step .",
    "this very long exposure ( _ i.e. _ , 155 second ) enhances the count statics , therefore , this data set is reliable for deriving various line parameters ( e.g. , doppler velocity , fwhm , etc . ) from the line profiles and also ideal for density diagnostics .",
    "standard hinode / eis routine eis@xmath8prep.pro , which is available in solarsoft ( ssw ) package , has been used for the calibration of raw data .",
    "this routine converts original raw data into physical data after processing various necessary steps , _",
    "e.g. _ , subtraction of the dark current , removal of cosmic rays and hot pixels and radiometric calibration , _ etc . _",
    "four spectral lines have been used in the present analysis as listed in table  1 .    .",
    "this table shows all the four lines , which are used in the present analysis .",
    "formation temperatures as well as the standard wavelengths are also listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : ch_ntv ]    the non - thermal velocity increase from si  vii up to the fe  xii and after that it decreases towards fe  xiii ion in the all selected boxes .",
    "we have included previous results as reported in @xcite .",
    "this plot covers a large portion of the solar atmosphere and allows us to compare our results with previous numbers .",
    "it also provides a new unified physical scenario in the solar atmosphere which shows how the non - thermal velocity behave between 4.0 k @xmath9 log t@xmath4 @xmath10 6.2 k , _",
    "i.e. _ , covering from chromosphere , tr , corona above qs .",
    "the behaviour of non - thermal velocity with temperature in all selected qs ( _ i.e. _ , 1@xmath11 , 2@xmath12 and 3@xmath13 ) boxes along with previous results has been shown in figure  [ fig : figure8 ] .",
    "we have also plotted the non - thermal velocities of ch boxes ( _ i.e. _ , 7@xmath14 and 8@xmath14 boxes ) in the same plot .",
    "we found that non - thermal velocities first rise up , attains a maximum value , and thereafter decreases further in the solar atmosphere ( _ i.e. , _ quiet - sun here ) .",
    "a 3@xmath13 order polynomial , using our qs non - thermal velocity ( _ i.e. _ , box 3 ) and non - thermal velocity by @xcite , has been fitted .",
    "this shows that the non - thermal velocity peaks at log t@xmath4@xmath05.47 k and after that the on - average non - thermal velocity decreases in the qs .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the polar coronal hole and adjacent quiet - sun , as observed on 10 october 2007 by _ hinode_/eis . using _",
    "spectra , a comparison between qs and ch has been performed . in the present study",
    ", we found that on average the line width of ch ( 39.42 m  ) is higher in comparison to the line width of qs ( 33.65 m , _ cf .",
    "_ , table  [ t - excess width ] ) .",
    "even , after setting a higher threshold limit of the line widths in ch ( _ i.e. _ , 1.35@xmath1ch average line width ) in comparison to the qs threshold line width limit ( _ i.e. _ , 1.20@xmath1qs average width ) to locate excess width locations in ch and qs , we found that ch has larger number of excess width locations in comparison to the excess width locations in qs ( see figure  [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "we assumed that excess width locations may correspond to regions where various type of transients / explosive events may occur in solar atmosphere .",
    "variations in the line width is directly related to the variations of the non - thermal width component ( section [ s - qs - ch ] ) , therefore , the ch has higher non - thermal width as well as large number of excess non - thermal width locations in comparison to the qs . as we know that chs are the source regions of the fast solar wind @xcite as well as the sites for oscillation and various type of mhd waves @xcite",
    "therefore , the presence of the larger non - thermal width and large number of excess width locations in the ch in comparison to the qs is quite obvious due to the presence of these flows / waves in the ch .",
    "it is now well established that the lower temperature lines are dominated by down - flows while higher temperature lines are dominated by blue - shifts in qs and ch @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is transition from red - shift to blue - shift at some temperature , which is an important observational parameter from the point of view of the tr models .",
    "excess width regions of qs are slightly blue - shifted at log t@xmath4 = 5.8 k ( _ i.e._,si  vii 275.35   ) , therefore , the inversion from red - shift to blue - shift has already been taken place below the log t@xmath4 = 5.8 .",
    "on the basis of observed blue - shift ( -1.9@xmath152.0 km s@xmath3 ) of the ne  viii 770.428    line as seen by sumer , which has a temperature similar to the temperature of si  vii line , @xcite have already been inferred that such transition occur at log t@xmath4 = 5.7 k in qs .",
    "therefore , we can also conclude that transition ( _ i.e. _ , from red - shift to blue - shift ) also takes place at the same temperature in these excess width regions of the qs . similar to excess width regions of qs , the average and excess width regions ( _ i.e. _ , box , 6 , 7 and 8) of ch also show marginal blue - shifts at log t@xmath4 = 5.8 k. therefore , we can infer that transition temperature in ch is similar to the qs .",
    "although , one ch box ( _ i.e. _ , box 4 ) , which is located at the coronal hole boundary , shows strong red - shift at log t@xmath4 = 5.8 k. this region might have been influenced by large number of explosive events .",
    "the properties of the excess width regions of the qs are similar to ch ( _ i.e. _ , excess and average width regions ) , but , the densities of the excess width regions of qs are higher in comparison to the ch . in contrast , one average width box ( box 3 ) of qs does not show the continuous plasma up - flows while another average width box ( box 5 ) shows continuous plasma up - flows .",
    "similarly , box 3 and 5 show strong blue - shift ( -3.24 km s@xmath3 ) and weak red - shift ( + 0.13 km s@xmath3 ) at log t@xmath4 = 5.8 , therefore , we can not deduce a common transition temperature for these average width regions of qs . as we know that the coronal funnels as well as small and large magnetic loops are the basic building blocks of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the upper tr line blue - shifts patches are associated with coronal funnels @xcite , although , these blue - shift patches may be associated with the magnetic loops as well . as we have shown earlier",
    "that qs excess width boxes show continuous plasma up - flows while qs average width region does not represent the continuous plasma up flows . similarly , the averaged densities of qs excess width regions are higher in comparison to the average width region of qs , although , the density difference is not very much .",
    "we should note that we are measuring the electron density on the basis of the intensity ratio of fe  xii line , which represents the electron density at coronal heights . at the coronal heights , due the large expansion of the coronal funnels , the electron density in the coronal funnels may not be different significantly from the surrounding region .",
    "therefore , slightly higher densities as well as presence of continuous plasma up - flows in the excess width regions of qs provide sufficient signature to identify that these excess width locations in qs are associated with the coronal funnels . on the basis of doppler velocity , excess width and density",
    ", we can not distinguish the excess width boxes from the average width boxes in qsch and ch . as we know that qs are mostly dominated by coronal loops and only a small fraction of the qs area is occupied by coronal funnels while the ch are mostly dominated by coronal funnels @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have easily located the coronal funnels in qs but it is very hard to isolate the footprints of the coronal funnels within coronal holes .",
    "it may be possible that all selected boxes in ch ( _ i.e. _ , excess and average ) are coronal funnel occupied regions because of large filling factor .",
    "we can propose that the plasma flow inversion ( _ i.e. _ , inversion from down - flows to up flows ) takes place at log t@xmath4 = 5.7 k in ch .",
    "similarly , the inversion of plasma flow also takes place at the same temperature ( log t@xmath4 = 5.7 k ) in excess width regions of qs .",
    "however , the average width regions of the qs do not show similar pattern of the doppler velocity , therefore , it is hard to get conclusive plasma flow inversion temperature in these average width regions of qs .",
    "finally , we found that excess width regions of qs show continuous plasma up - flows as well as high density concentration while the average width region of qs does not follow continuous plasma flow pattern and the density of the average width region is lower in comparison to the excess width regions of qs .",
    "therefore , the excess width regions are the most probable locations of coronal funnels in qs , however , we could not locate the footprints of coronal funnels in the qsch and ch using the same procedure . as we know that the coronal holes are dominated by open magnetic filed lines , therefore",
    ", it may be possible that all the selected regions of qsch and ch ( except box 5 ) at these heights are within coronal funnels because in ch the parameters are similar within funnel and the adjacent background region .",
    "apart from this , doppler shift of tr and coronal lines has been also investigated while combining our results with previously reported numbers from sumer ( _ cf .",
    "_ , figure  [ fig : figure6 ] ) .",
    "this new plot now covers a wide range of temperature from chromosphere up to high corona .",
    "doppler velocity inversion from red - shift to blue - shift takes place around log t@xmath4 = 5.7 k ( see the peak of 4@xmath14 order polynomial fit in figure  [ fig : figure6 ] ) , which is in good agreement with earlier results @xcite .",
    "recently fu _ et al_. ( 2014 ) have measured the doppler velocity variations with temperature in the same npch area , however , they have focused on the on - disk plume structures .",
    "we feel that these plume structures could be also used as tracers of coronal funnels .",
    "some of their results complement results presented here .",
    "our focus has been on the line widths rather than the outflow velocities alone .",
    "earlier , 1-d models which assumes energy release in magnetic loops had successfully managed to reproduce the observed red - shift at tr temperatures and blue - shifts at coronal temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , these models do not explicitly consider the heating mechanisms . more recently ,",
    "srivastava _ et al_. ( 2014 ) presented numerical model in 2-d realistic solar atmosphere , the generation of the blue - shifts ( out - flows ) due to heating pulses , as observed by hinode / eis at coronal temperature .",
    "@xcite presented , 3d models assuming that the coronal heating is caused by joule dissipation of currents produced by stressing and braiding of the magnetic fields produce red - shifts at all temperatures .",
    "episodic injection of emerging magnetic flux , which reconnects with the existing field , produces rapid , episodic heating of the upper chromospheric plasma to coronal temperatures @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the averaged doppler shifts from 0.01 up to 2.1 mk and they have shown that 3d coronal models are more appropriate for the explanation of the observed doppler velocity pattern from chromosphere up to the corona .",
    "+ the inhomogeneous solar plasma should support different mhd modes as well as acoustic wave and this has been confirmed by observations and theory @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that several mechanisms are responsible for the non - thermal broadening , _",
    "e.g. _ , propagation of waves @xcite , non - thermal motions @xcite , mhd turbulence @xcite and nano - flare heating @xcite . in - spite of all these physical processes ,",
    "the nature of the non - thermal broadening is not fully understood .",
    "we confirm here a more complete picture of the non - thermal velocity in the wide temperature range from @xmath0 1.0@xmath110@xmath6 k to 1.58@xmath110@xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : figure8 ] ) .",
    "initially , the non - thermal velocity increases with temperature but after certain tr temperature ( log t@xmath4=5.8 k ) non - thermal velocity decreases further upto inner corona ( log t@xmath4=6.2 k ) .",
    "undamped alfvn waves are responsible for non - thermal broadening @xcite , while narrowing of spectra after a certain height in the solar atmosphere is most likely signature of the alfvn wave dissipation @xcite .",
    "therefore , propagation of alfvn waves increases the non - thermal velocity up to the inversion point in qs ( log t@xmath4 = 5.47 k ) and after the inversion point , which lies in the upper tr / lower corona , alfvn waves may dissipate through various mechanisms , _",
    "e.g. _ , viscous @xmath5 ohmic @xcite , resonant absorption @xcite , phase mixing , _",
    "although , which mechanism is responsible for the alfvn wave dissipation can not be speculated here .",
    "this is one possible explanation for our results related to the non - thermal velocity pattern in qs .",
    "apart from the alfvn wave propagation and dissipation mechanism , another possible explanation may lie in terms of the nano - flares , which is frequently occurring at o  vi temperature @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that non - thermal velocity peak is at the same o  vi formation temperature ( _ i.e. _ , 3@xmath110@xmath16 ) and they concluded that non - thermal velocities arise due to the prevalent occurrence of the nano - flares in this region .",
    "the presence of the lower values of non - thermal velocities above and below this region is quite obvious due to the energy loss . in the present case , the non - thermal velocity peaks at log t@xmath4 = 5.47 k ( 2.95@xmath110@xmath2 k ) in the qs .",
    "therefore , our peak value of the non - thermal velocity is also very close to the o  vi formation temperature and it may be probable justification for our non - thermal results . in conclusion ,",
    "alfvn wave propagation and dissipation as well as prevalent occurrence of the nano - flares around at o  vi formation temperature can explain the variation of non - thermal velocity with temperature .",
    "these two mechanisms are the viable source but that does not rule out other possibilities .",
    "our results should help in constraining the atmospheric models .",
    "we hope that our attempt of identifying the footprints of coronal funnels based on density contrast and excess widths shed new light on the overall complexity and topology of the polar regions in general .",
    "this approach of searching for additional widths as precursors for transients can be further improved with future better resolution spectrographs .",
    "we acknowledge the hinode / eis observation for this study .",
