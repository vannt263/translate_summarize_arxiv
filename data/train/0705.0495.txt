    "electro - negative gases , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , play an important role in plasma - assisted materials processing .",
    "most notably @xmath4 , either as the main feedstock gas or as an admixture to halogen- or silicon - based gases , is of vital importance for a large variety of etching and thin - film deposition techniques  @xcite .",
    "the requirements on the controllability and predictability of these processes are so high that further advancement of this technology will depend on modeling tools which go beyond the macroscopic , fluid - type approximations , which , for instance , can not reliably predict the velocity distributions of the species .",
    "although electro - negative gas discharges have been studied for a long time  @xcite , with significant progress made during the last two decades  @xcite , a complete quantitative description is still lacking , in particular , with respect to discharge profiles , structuring , and operation regimes  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because the occurrence of negative ions leads to abrupt changes in the ion density ( density fronts  @xcite ) which in most cases force the discharge to stratify into a central quasi - neutral ion - ion plasma and a peripheral electro - positive electron - ion plasma  @xcite .",
    "the transition between the two is rather subtle",
    ". it can be , for instance , accompanied by a double layer ( internal sheath  @xcite ) .",
    "electro - negative gas discharges are thus rather complex and the investigation of the spatio - temporal structure of the discharge as a function of external control parameters ( current , voltage , frequency , pressure , and geometry ) is a great theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite challenge . in addition , electro - negative processing gases are reactive molecular gases , with internal degrees of freedom , which lead to a quite involved plasma chemistry .",
    "similar to the kinetic description of a mixture of reacting gases  @xcite , the modeling of a gas discharge could be based on a coupled set of boltzmann equations for the distribution functions of the species which need to be treated kinetically .",
    "this set has to be augmented by maxwell s equations , or parts of it , depending on how the discharge is electrically driven . even for simple reactive gas discharges , with only two negatively and one positively charged species ,",
    "this approach is not practical .",
    "more promising are methods which track representative samples of simulated particles subject to ( non - reactive and reactive ) collisions as well as electromagnetic fields , which are again determined from the relevant parts of maxwell s equations .",
    "although these approaches are closely related to the direct simulation method successfully employed for the modeling of the flow of rarefied gases  @xcite , in the context of gas discharges  @xcite , it is more common to refer to them as particle - in - cell monte carlo collision ( pic - mcc ) methods  @xcite , because without collisions the methods collapse to the pic approach  @xcite for the solution of the vlasov problem .",
    "this is the first paper in a series of three where we report the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the interplay between plasma - chemistry and electrodynamics in capacitively coupled radio - frequency ( rf ) discharges in oxygen .",
    "oxygen is a weakly electro - negative gas whose plasma chemistry is strongly affected by vibrational , rotational and meta - stable states . up",
    "to 75 reaction and scattering processes have been listed to potentially affect the properties of the discharge  @xcite .",
    "not all of them can be equally important .",
    "the challenge is therefore to identify ( via comparison between experiment and modeling ) the subset of collisions responsible for the experimental findings under consideration .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe such a reduced model .",
    "it is tailor - made for the investigation of the charged species of the discharge , including the formation of ion density fronts , internal sheaths , and the resulting stratification of the discharge .",
    "we critically assess the cross sections used to characterize the selected collision channels and point out some inconsistencies in previously used cross section data .",
    "the validity of our model is verified by a comparison of calculated bulk densities with experimentally measured ones  @xcite .",
    "the following two papers discuss , from the experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite point of view , respectively , the sheath region of the discharge focusing on the @xmath5 double emission layer in front of the powered electrode and a comparison of experimental and simulated distribution functions for positive ions .",
    "the next section describes the main features of our pic - mcc implementation  @xcite .",
    "it is an extension of a code , which was originally designed for the particle - based modeling of sheaths in magnetized plasmas  @xcite , to the case of electrically driven discharges in reactive molecular gases .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the handling of collision processes , which deviates from the treatments usually employed in the plasma context  @xcite and is closer to the simulation approaches used in rarefied gas dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the collisions included in our model are discussed in section iii .",
    "where necessary , we combine measured cross sections  @xcite with model cross sections  @xcite to characterize collisions and fix the free parameters through a comparison with experimental data .",
    "in section iv we show that once the parameters are fixed , good agreement between simulation and experiment can be achieved in the bulk of the discharge .",
    "section v summarizes the essentials of our model and concludes with a short outlook .",
    "schematic geometry of the rf discharges used in refs .",
    "we use a planar , one - dimensional model to simulate the central axial part of the discharge ( thick solid line ) . ]",
    "we are only interested in the central axial part of the rf discharges described in refs .",
    "@xcite . ignoring the electric asymmetry between the powered and grounded electrode ,",
    "this part of the discharge can be simulated by the planar , one - dimensional model shown in figure  [ geometry ] .",
    "the planar model retains only one spatial coordinate @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance between the electrodes , but it keeps the full three - dimensional velocity space for the particles ( 1d3v model ) .",
    "one of the electrodes is driven by the rf voltage @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , while the other is grounded .",
    "both electrodes are assumed to be totally absorbing ; secondary electron emission is neglected . to mimic the constant oxygen flow through the discharge chamber ,",
    "we enforce in the simulation volume a constant oxygen pressure ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the simulation volume of the planar model is of course not well defined because the lateral `` cross - section '' a is a free parameter .",
    "this parameter actually controls the weight of the simulated particles , that is , the number of real particles represented by one simulated particle .",
    "we arbitrarily choose @xmath16 with @xmath17 the electron debye length of a reference electron system ( res ) which we use to initially set - up the length and time scales of the simulation ( see below ) .",
    "the res is specified by a density @xmath18 and a temperature @xmath19 .",
    "both have to be adjusted to the particular experimental conditions . for the experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath22 , resulting in approximately @xmath23 simulated particles .",
    "the complex plasma - chemistry of oxygen gives rise to a large number of non - reactive and reactive collisions  @xcite . in table",
    "[ reactions ] we show the ones with the largest cross sections .",
    "they are included in our model and will be discussed in detail in section iii .",
    "we treat only three species kinetically : electrons ( @xmath24 ) , negatively charged oxygen atoms ( @xmath25 ) , and positively charged oxygen molecules ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "neutral particles appearing either as educts or products in table  [ reactions ] are not explicitly simulated . molecular oxygen in its ground state , @xmath27 ( feedstock gas ) , is modelled as a reservoir characterized by a pressure @xmath28 and a temperature @xmath29 . whereas atomic oxygen , @xmath30 , vibrationally excited oxygen molecules , @xmath31 , the rydberg state of the molecular oxygen , @xmath32 , and the molecular meta - stables , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are only indirectly accounted for in as far as their production results in an energy loss for electrons .",
    "the meta - stable @xmath33 requires special attention because it also appears as an educt in the entrance channel for associative detachment ( 17 ) .",
    "its concentration is therefore important , and we should actually build - up the @xmath33 distribution function , that is , we should also simulate @xmath33 particles . in that case , however , not only their volume production process ( 11 ) but also their volume and surface loss processes should be included .",
    "this is beyond the one - dimensional model . to take associative detachment ,",
    "which is known to be an important process  @xcite , nevertheless into account , we use instead a simple model with one free parameter , which can be interpreted as the @xmath33 to @xmath27 density ratio ( see below ) .",
    "the three - species pic - mcc model describes the physics of an @xmath4 discharge by tracing the spatio - temporal evolution of an ensemble of charged particles ( @xmath24 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) . as usual , to track the velocities and positions of the simulated particles , the simulation domain @xmath37 and the time are discretized and free flights are decoupled from collisions ( see figure  [ alg ] ) . in order to have stable free flights of charged particles ( in the mean electric field given by the poisson equation ) , the spatial resolution @xmath38 has to be less then the electronic debye length , @xmath17 , and the time step @xmath39 should resolve the electron plasma oscillation whose frequency is @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath40 are set by the res .",
    "the time interval over which collisions and free flights are decoupled is of the order of the mean free time , which , in general , is much larger then the fundamental time step @xmath39 enforced by the electric field .",
    "we distinguish two groups of collisions , each of which characterized by an average mean free time .",
    "the first group of collisions , occurring on a time scale @xmath41 comprises all collisions of table  [ reactions ] except coulomb collisions between charged particles , which take place on a different time scale @xmath42 .",
    "graphical representation of our implementation of the pic - mcc scheme . ]    to build up a representative sample for the charged particles , we first sample the initial distribution functions for @xmath24 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and then repeat the following procedure  @xcite ( see figure  [ alg ] ) :    * for @xmath43 time steps , the coordinates and velocities of all simulated particles are moved according to newton s equations of motion .",
    "the force acting on particles with charge @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electric potential satisfying the poisson equation with the boundary conditions specified above .",
    "force interpolation and charge assignment are done within a linear interpolation scheme . *",
    "after @xmath47 time steps , a representative sample of the first class of collisions is executed , with post - collision velocities stochastically determined in accordance with energy and momentum conservation , followed by free flights with @xmath48 time steps , where @xmath49 , after which a representative random sample of coulomb collisions is performed , again consistent with energy and momentum conservation .",
    "after typically @xmath50 rf cycles quasi - stationarity with respect to the rf cycle is achieved , that is , within the statistical noise , macroscopic quantities , for instance , density and potential profiles , do not change anymore when averaged over a rf cycle .",
    "our treatment of collisions utilizes a number of concepts originally developed for the direct simulation monte carlo of rarefied gas flows  @xcite . since it differs from the handling of collisions in the standard pic - mcc schemes , which is based on the null - collision method  @xcite , we give some more details . after a free flight",
    "is completed , we sort the simulated particles into cells ( see figure  [ alg ] ) .",
    "simulated and feedstock gas particles located in one and the same cell ( collisions are local ) have then the opportunity to sequentially perform all possible types of collisions with each other .",
    "simulated particles produced in the exit channel of a collision are readmitted for the next collision in the list .",
    "the ordering of particles into cells has to be repeated after each collision producing or annihilating simulated particles .",
    "thus , as in the real system , simulated particles may perform more than one type of collision within the time interval over which the simulation decouples free flights and collisions .",
    "the probability of a simulated particle @xmath51 to make a collision of type @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 it depends on the density @xmath54 of the collision partners which act as the targets , the total cross section @xmath55 for the collision , the relative velocity @xmath56 between particle @xmath51 and a particular collision partner , and the mean free time @xmath57 . as can be seen in table  [ reactions ] , except for associative detachment ( 17 ) , which we discuss in more detail in the next section , the three species model recruits collision partners either from the simulated particles or from the feedstock gas @xmath3 . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath54 is the number of simulated particles of the respective type in the considered cell divided by the cell volume , whereas in the second case , @xmath58 , with @xmath28 the gas pressure and @xmath29 the room temperature .",
    "we do not calculate the mean free times @xmath57 for all the collisions listed in table  [ reactions ] .",
    "instead , we set @xmath59 for coulomb collisions ( 1 )    ( 3 ) and @xmath60 for the remaining collisions ( 4 )    ( 19 ) .",
    "in order to verify that our code treats collisions correctly , we performed various test runs and compared the results either with analytical results  @xcite or with results obtained from the bit1 code  @xcite .",
    "the latter was also used to check discrepancies in the cross section data .",
    ".[reactions ] collisions included in our model [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     collisions strongly influence the particle concentration and the energy balance in the discharge . for oxygen ,",
    "an overwhelming number of elastic , inelastic , and reactive collisions is possible .",
    "restricting , however , the description to a three species plasma ( @xmath24 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) many processes can be ignored and others can be treated approximately . in table",
    "[ reactions ] we show the collisions defining our three species model for an oxygen discharge , and classify them into three groups : elastic scattering , electron energy loss scattering , and electron and ion production and loss reactions .",
    "the respective cross sections for these processes are shown in figures  [ elasticxs ]    [ prodlossxs ] as a function of the relative energy of the two particles in the entrance channel of the respective process .",
    "our collection of cross sections is semi - empirical , combining measured data , which is usually available only in a finite energy range , with simple models for the low - energy asymptotic , which in most cases is not very well known from experiments . in general , the high - energy asymptotic has to be also determined from models , but it is less critical because the distribution functions usually decay sufficiently fast at high energies . if not stated otherwise , we extrapolated therefore the values of the cross sections for the largest energies shown in the plots to all energies above it .",
    "some of the cross sections significantly deviate from the ones previously used  @xcite .",
    "our simulations indicate , however , that the modifications are essential for obtaining bulk densities in accordance with experiments  @xcite .",
    "elastic collisions ( 1 )    ( 6 ) are particle number conserving .",
    "thus , when a collision takes place , only the post - collision velocities of the scattering partners have to be determined whereas the list of simulated particles remains unaltered .    the first three scattering processes ( 1 )",
    "  ( 3 ) are intra - species coulomb collisions .",
    "they are not very important for the experiments  @xcite we analyze in this series of papers . for other parameter regimes , however , the _ local _ ion density in an electro - negative gas discharge can be rather high  @xcite and it can not be ruled out that ion - ion coulomb collisions affect , for instance , the width of these ion density peaks . since the computational burden is moderate , we kept intra - species coulomb scattering in all our simulations .",
    "if not stated otherwise , inter - species coulomb collisions were however neglected .    for coulomb collisions , we used a binary collision model  @xcite with a uniformly distributed azimuth angle @xmath61 , and a gaussian distribution for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the scattering angle .",
    "the second moment of the gaussian distribution is given by  @xcite @xmath64 with @xmath65 the collision time for coulomb scattering , @xmath66 the coulomb logarithm , @xmath67 the magnitude of the relative velocity in the center - of - mass frame , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 the local density , the charge , the reduced mass of the charged species under consideration , and the dielectric constant of the vacuum , respectively .",

    "figure  [ elasticxs ] shows the cross sections for elastic scattering of electrons ( 4 ) and @xmath35 ions ( 5 ) on @xmath4 molecules together with the cross section for charge exchange scattering ( 6 ) of @xmath36 ions on @xmath4 molecules .",
    "since little is known about the angle dependence of these processes , we assume the collisions to be isotropic , with a uniform distribution of the azimuth angle @xmath61 and a uniform distribution of @xmath74 , where @xmath63 is again the scattering angle .",
    "the cross section for elastic scattering of electrons on @xmath4  @xcite is the same as in ref .",

    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we ignore @xmath101 dissociation , because , in the energy range of interest , its cross section is one order of magnitude smaller than for @xmath97 and @xmath98 dissociation , and rotational excitation which is almost elastic ( small energy transfer ) and thus dominated by the much more efficient elastic scattering of electrons on @xmath4 .",
    "electron and ion production and loss reactions ( 13 )    ( 19 ) are inelastic collisions which change the number of charged particles .",

    "impact ionization ( 18 ) and impact detachment ( 19 ) are modelled as follows : first , an inelastic binary collision is performed , in which the parent electron looses the ionization ( detachment ) energy .",

    "@xcite , we plot in figure  [ fminus ] for @xmath124 and @xmath135 the ( marginal ) velocity distribution function for negative ions , @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "clearly , the majority of @xmath35 ions is cold ; the distribution function spreads out only in the region where the bulk plasma merges with the peripheral plasma at @xmath138 .",
    "thus , loss processes whose cross sections are large for small energies ( see figure  [ prodlossxs ] ) , that is , ion - ion neutralization and associative detachment , will be very efficient .",
    "direct detachment , on the other hand , whose cross section has a threshold , will be suppressed . at low energies ,",
    "both ion - ion neutralization and associative detachment have cross sections which increase with decreasing energy .",
    "which process dominates depends therefore also on the collision probability @xmath139 . for ion - ion neutralization @xmath139",
    "is proportional to the @xmath36 density while for associative detachment it is proportional to the @xmath126 density . since for the discharge of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath36 density is much smaller than the @xmath126 density , which we estimated to be @xmath140 of the @xmath4 density , associative detachment has to be the main loss process for negative ions in this experiment .",
    "quasi - stationary , cycle - averaged negative ion velocity distribution function @xmath136 with @xmath137 for @xmath135 ; @xmath28 , @xmath8 , and @xmath134 as in figure  [ central ] . ]    additional support for this claim comes from the weak voltage dependence of the @xmath35 density between @xmath12 and @xmath141 indicating that both @xmath35 production and @xmath35 loss are in this voltage range rather insensitive to voltage changes .",
    "we will now show that this strongly suggests that associative detachment is the main loss process for @xmath35 ions .",
    "first , we conclude from figure  [ felectron ] , which shows the attachment cross section ( in arbitrary units ) together with bulk electron velocity distribution functions for different voltages , that the energy range between @xmath142 and @xmath143 will be the most important one for the attachment process ; for energies below @xmath142 the production is zero because the cross section is zero while for energies above @xmath143 the number of electrons available for attachment is too low .",
    "we also see that in the voltage range of interest , the electron velocity distribution function does not change much in this energy range .",
    "thus , the production process is almost voltage - independent and the observed near constancy of the @xmath35 density has to be taken as a signature of the loss process .",
    "as already mentioned , direct detachment can be ruled out .",
    "ion - ion neutralization , on the other hand , would lead for @xmath144 , that is , in the relevant energy range , to an energy - resolved rate coefficient @xmath145 which strongly increases with decreasing energy .",
    "thus , even small , voltage - induced changes of the energy of negative ions would suffice to lead to noticeable modifications of the loss rate .",
    "what remains is associative detachment .",
    "the energy - resolved rate coefficient for this process is @xmath146 . at the same time , the distribution function for @xmath103 ions does not change much between @xmath12 to @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the loss rate due to associative detachment is nearly independent of voltage .",
    "together with the voltage independence of dissociative attachment , this leads to the observed constancy of the @xmath103 density .",
    "quasi - stationary , cycle - averaged electron velocity distribution function @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath122 for @xmath149 , and @xmath141 ; @xmath28 , @xmath8 , and @xmath134 as in figure  [ central ] .",
    "the dotted line indicates the cross section for dissociative attachment ( 15 ) in arbitrary units . ]",
    "our simulation reproduces the absolute values of bulk densities fairly well .",
    "the ( axial ) density profiles of the simulation decay however too fast compared to the experimental ones ( open symbols in figure  [ profiles ] ) .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the simulations assume a constant @xmath117 density , whereas , in reality , there should be a density profile , because of the interplay of volume and surface loss and generation processes for @xmath117 molecules . in particular surface losses , that is , the decay of @xmath117 molecules when they hit the boundary of the discharge should play an important role because they lead to a depletion of @xmath117 molecules in the vicinity of the electrodes and thus to a reduction of associative detachment .",
    "a detailed investigation of the `` drag '' the @xmath117 density is expected to exert on the @xmath103 density is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we presented a planar , one - dimensional pic - mcc model for a capacitively coupled rf discharge in oxygen which is capable to quantitatively describe experiments .",
    "its main features are : ( i ) only electrons , @xmath35 ions , and @xmath36 ions are treated kinetically .",
    "( ii ) neutral particles are only incorporated in as far as they affect the particle and energy balance of simulated charged particles .",
    "( iii ) a direct simulation monte carlo model for collisions has been used , with two groups of collisions , which differ in the collision times .",
    "the elementary processes of our three species model are shown in table  [ reactions ] .",
    "we took the processes with the largest cross sections into account .",
    "when possible , we implemented empirical cross sections . in some cases , however , we combined them with analytical model cross sections to obtain the correct low - energy asymptotic .",
    "in particular , we used a polarization - type scattering model for elastic @xmath150 scattering , a landau - zener - type model for @xmath151 neutralization , and an inverse classical , langevin - type capturing model for @xmath117-induced associative detachment . to describe associative detachment due to @xmath117 without explicitly calculating the @xmath117 density",
    ", we furthermore introduced a parameter @xmath114 , which should be fitted to the particular oxygen discharge under consideration and could be interpreted as the fraction of @xmath4 molecules in the meta - stable @xmath117 state .",
    "as a first application of our model , we simulated the discharge of ref .  @xcite . after we adjusted the parameter @xmath114 to reproduce the bulk ion densities for @xmath124 and @xmath130 , we also obtained the correct bulk densities for other voltages .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 , that is , approximately one sixth of the oxygen molecules are in the meta - stable state .",
    "we also pointed out that the weak voltage dependence of the bulk densities for fixed pressure indicates that @xmath35 losses due to associative detachment dominate the ones due to ion - ion neutralization .    although we could reasonably well describe electron and ion densities in the bulk , the ( axial ) ion density profiles of the simulation are too narrow compared to the experimental ones .",
    "most probably this is because we assumed a constant @xmath117 density . in reality , however , @xmath117 molecules decay when they hit the boundary of the discharge .",
    "the @xmath117 density should therefore decrease in the vicinity of the electrodes and with it associative detachment . to take this effect into account",
    "requires however a model which not only treats electrons , @xmath35 ions , and @xmath36 ions kinetically , but also @xmath117 molecules .",
    "our concern in the present paper , which is the first in a series of three , was the calibration and validation of a three species model for capacitively coupled rf discharges in oxygen .",
    "for that purpose , we used published experimental data for the bulk of the discharge  @xcite .",
    "the following paper  @xcite describes the results of an experimental investigation of the sheath region of such a discharge , focusing , among others , on the spatial and temporal evolution of the @xmath5 double emission layer in front of the powered electrode . in the third paper  @xcite ,",
    "finally , we will use the three species model to simulate the sheath region . besides a comparison of simulated with measured distribution functions for positive ions",
    ", we will also present a model for the @xmath5 double emission layer .",
    "the three species model , including its approximate treatment of associative detachment , is sufficient for that purpose , because negative ions are negligible in the region from which the emission originates .",
    "negative ions are only needed for the overall charge balance of the discharge .",
    "their density profile per se is not crucial for the explanation of the @xmath5 double emission layer as long as it features a vanishingly small density in front of the electrode .",
    "this is already accomplished by the three species model .",
