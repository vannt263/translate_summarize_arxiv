    "such behavior is typical for objects of dimension at most two , but systolic complexes and groups , and related classes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are the first highly dimensional counterparts .",
    "this implies , in particular , that systolic groups are very distinct from many classical groups , e.g.  from uniform lattices in @xmath1 , for @xmath2  see @xcite .    in the current article we present an algebraic counterpart of the asymptotic asphericity phenomenon",
