    "corot @xcite , scheduled for launch by the end of 2006 , will be the first space mission with the capability to detect extrasolar planets with sizes down to a couple of earth radii @xcite .",
    "it will observe a total of 60,000 stars in 5 runs of 150 days each . in a previous paper",
    ", we worked out a theoretical estimate of the planet detection capability of corot @xcite . in this paper , we first describe our transit detection algorithm , dubbed _",
    ", then we report its performance on simulated light curves ( lcs ) , and finally , we discuss the tools we are developing to discriminate between genuine exoplanets and astrophysical false positives ( binary stars ) .",
    "at low signal - to - noise ( snr ) , a transit signal can be approximated by a rectangular signal oscillating between a high level @xmath0 ( outside the transit ) and a low level @xmath1 ( during the transit ) .",
    "the amplitude of this signal depends on the ratio of the planet surface to that of the star : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "the time spent at level @xmath1 , or transit duration @xmath4 , is much shorter than the transit period @xmath5 .",
    "we note @xmath6 the date of the beginning of the first transit falling inside the observation window ( 150 days for corot ) .    in order to detect the transit signal in a noisy lc , we adopt the matched - filter approach that consists in correlating the lc with rectangular signals of the type described above .",
    "we call _ test - signals _ these rectangular signals .",
    "each of them is characterized by a parameter triplet @xmath7 .",
    "the correlation reaches a peak when @xmath8 .",
    "practically , lcs must be first high - pass filtered to remove irrelevant low - frequency variations ( stellar fluctuations ) that would bias the correlation , and we take the negative of the lcs so that transits would produce positive correlation peaks .    for , this method to work ,",
    "the three - dimensional space @xmath7 must be explored with a sufficient resolution in the given range accessible to corot ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the choice of this resolution results from a trade - off between computing time and detection efficiency . typically , we use steps @xmath12 small enough so that the maximum correlation signal would be no less than 75% of its theoretical maximum value .",
    "this requirement translates into the computation of @xmath13 correlations per lc , a task completed in 90  s with a fully idl - coded algorithm on a pentium  m at 1.6  ghz .",
    "however , preliminary tests indicate that an optimized idl ",
    "c hybrid code could cut down the computing time by a factor 78 , which would make possible a higher detection efficiency .",
    "practically , we use as our primary detection metric not the correlation itself , but the snr on the correlation defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the standard deviation of the noise affecting the high - pass filtered lc , and @xmath16 is the number of transits in the observation window .",
    "a theoretical detection threshold can be simply set assuming : ( 1 ) a total number of lcs , ( 2 ) a false detection rate , and ( 3 ) gaussian white noise ( see * ? ? ?",
    "requiring less than 1 false detection , we obtain @xmath17 for 1,000 lcs , and @xmath18 for 60,000 lcs .      in order to train the co -",
    "investigators of the corot exoplanet consortium and compare the performances of existing transit detection algorithms , a first transit detection blind test ( bt1 ) was organized inside the consortium in 2004 @xcite .",
    "bt1 consisted in the analysis of 999 lcs with no information on the target stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : histograms ] ( left ) shows the distribution of @xmath19 for bt1 .",
    "a priori , one would expect a bimodal distribution , where lcs without transits would appear at low @xmath19 , whereas lcs with transits would appear at high @xmath19 , and a dividing line around 6.5 .",
    "if the obtained distribution is indeed bimodal , the plot suggests a dividing line , or detection threshold , of either @xmath20 ( 175 selected lcs ) or @xmath21 ( 28 selected lcs ) , largely above the theoretical estimate .",
    "this discrepancy stems from the inaccuracy of the white noise hypothesis as pointed out by @xcite .",

    "right : @xmath22 histogram . the dashed and dotted lines mark thresholds at 4 and 5 , respectively . [",
    "fig : histograms],width=245 ]    we find that a secondary detection metric computed on the folded lc ( flc ) helps the selection process .",
    "we define this new metric as @xmath23 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured on the flc , and @xmath24 is the standard deviation of the noise affecting the high - pass filtered flc .",
    "figure  [ fig : histograms ] ( right ) shows the distribution of @xmath22 for bt1 .",
    "this new plot suggests a threshold of either @xmath25 ( 42 selected lcs ) or @xmath26 ( 16 selected lcs ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath27 is the right criterion as the 12 genuine planets correctly detected by _ transdet _ in this exercise are among the 42 selected lcs ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : snr1snr2 ] ) .     vs. @xmath19 diagram .",
    "crosses and squares are overplotted on genuine planets and binary stars , respectively .",
    "a thresholding in @xmath22 selects all planets much more efficiently than a thresholding in @xmath19 .",
    "[ fig : snr1snr2],width=340 ]      figure  [ fig : capability ] is an attempt to estimate the detection capability of _ transdet _ from the results of bt1 in much the same way as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  7 ) .",
    "the solid line is a line at constant @xmath19 adjusted so that all detected planets lie above it , and all undetected planets lie under it . from this , we conclude that the detection limit would be about 300  ppm at @xmath28 , which could be a 2 earth - radii planet around a g2v star with a 3-day period .     and @xmath29 for bt1 . a line at constant @xmath19 marks the bottom of the region where transits were detected.[fig : capability],width=340 ]",
    "the vast majority of transit signals are not caused by planets , but rather by stellar companions in binary stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : grazing eclipsing binary ( geb ) or background eclipsing binary ( beb ) blended with foreground stars may produce transits with amplitudes consistent with planetary companions .",
    "radial velocimetry provides the definitive way to discriminate planets from binaries .",
    "however , it would be much too time - consuming to observe every single candidate , thus it is mandatory for the success of transits searches to sort out as many candidates as possible using the photometry alone",
    ". a second transit detection blind test ( bt2 ) was organized inside the corot consortium in 2006 to work toward this goal .",
    "bt2 participants were given 237 lcs measured in the three corot photometric channels , as well as the spectral types of the target stars .",
    "a first clear indicator of the stellar nature of the companion is the presence of a secondary eclipse in the lc .",
    "therefore , once the primary eclipse has been found , we scan the flc for shallower transit - like events .",
    "a second indicator is the presence of ellipsoidal variability : tidal forces exerted by a massive companion at short orbital distance distort the primary s shape into an ellipsoid . because the ellipsoid rotates with the orbital motion , the apparent stellar disk varies and the lc s baseline is modulated at twice the orbital frequency ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also scan the flc for this modulation .",
    "corot s entry catalog contains photometrically - determined spectral types for target stars , as well as estimates for stellar masses and radii . with the target radius and the measured transit depth ,",
    "it is straightforward to check that the companion s radius lies in the planet range , say @xmath30 .    for short orbital periods where the assumption of a circular orbit is reasonable ,",
    "the transit duration can be checked against the maximum transit duration computed for an equatorial transit , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is in hours , @xmath5 in days , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 in solar units . a measured duration greater than",
    "@xmath32 would either point to a problem with the transit parameters ( e.g. , an incorrect period ) or with the parameters of the star in front of which the transit is occurring , thus betraying a beb with a spectral type different than that of the target .",
    "finally , the transit shape can be an indicator of gbs for partial occultations produce v - shape transits . to quantify this",
    ", we fit a trapeze to the transit in order to measure the duration @xmath35 of the flat part of the transit ( between ingress and egress ) as well as the total transit duration @xmath4 , and we compute @xmath36 .",
    "currently , our v - shape criterion is arbitrarily defined as @xmath37 .",
    "corot will have the unique capability to measure transits in three spatially - separated color channels thanks to a prism objective .",
    "only bebs perfectly aligned with target stars will produce transits in the three channels .",
    "therefore , transit chromaticity will be a powerful indicator of a false positive .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , corot s color channels will be referred to as @xmath38 ( blue ) , @xmath39 ( green ) , and @xmath40 ( red ) , but note that they do not correspond to any existing photometric systems .",
    "we define now three chromaticity indicators , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the relative transits depths in the color channels , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , the corresponding standard deviations of the noise .",
    "figure  [ fig : color ] shows chromaticity diagrams for a selection of bt2 lcs . in this case , we applied a @xmath48 threshold to classify lcs as chromatic .",
    "limit.[fig : color],width=340 ]",
    "we have developed _ transdet _ , a matched - filter based algorithm for transit detection , as well as tools for false positive discrimination using the lcs alone .",
    "all of these were developed and tested using blind tests conducted within the corot consortium .",
    "however , fine tuning of the thresholds for the various tests will be done by studying the statistics of real corot data .",
    "this work was performed in part under contract 1256791 with the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , funded by nasa through the michelson fellowship program .",
    "jpl is managed for nasa by the california institute of technology .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system ."
