    "black hole excision has become an important technique in numerical relativity .",
    "first proposed by unruh @xcite , excision consists in placing an outflow inner boundary which eliminates the black hole singularity from the domain .",
    "sometimes combined with singularity - avoiding slicings , it is used in all of the current long - term black hole evolutions .",
    "( for review articles see refs .",
    "@xcite , some more recent work includes  @xcite",
    ". ) excision has proved most successful with black holes at a fixed coordinate location .",
    "for example , in studies of orbiting compact objects ( black holes and/or neutron stars ) , long runs have been achieved in co - rotating frames , where dynamic gauge conditions attempt to keep the black holes at fixed locations . for more general orbits , and for simulations over many orbital time scales , it is anticipated that the ability to move the black holes on the computational grid through a stable excision algorithm will be crucial .",
    "excision methods for moving black holes typically require the extrapolation of data onto the trailing edge of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "we recently reported on a new excision method using simultaneous , multiple coordinate patches , and implemented these numerically using overlapping grids @xcite . in this method each boundary , whether an outer boundary or an excision boundary , moving or static with respect to a main coordinate system , is fixed to at least one coordinate system .",
    "the different coordinate patches overlap just like the charts of an atlas .",
    "information is communicated from one grid to the other using only interpolation , without any decomposition into ingoing and outgoing variables .",
    "this excision method has a number of advantages , including : ( 1 ) the possibility of choosing coordinate patches which conform to each individual boundary , giving smooth numerical boundaries and thus simplifying the boundary treatment ; ( 2 ) the ability to adapt the coordinates near the black hole to the horizon geometry , allowing the excision surface to be placed relatively far from the singularity , and thereby `` excising the excisable '' ; ( 3 ) the use of simple data structures and the implementation of standard methods for parallelization and adaptive mesh refinement due to the fact that individual grids are logically cartesian .    in our previous work we demonstrated this excision method by evolving a klein  gordon massless scalar field on a boosted schwarzschild background .",
    "numerical tests showed that the scheme was stable and second order convergent for very large boost parameters ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "long - term convergence test of spherical waves in minkowski space also showed that the interfaces between the overlapping grids did not introduce growing numerical errors .",
    "moreover , our tests indicated that the overlapping grids technique is robust , in the sense that stability was not dependent on some of the fine details of the implementation .",
    "for example , stability was independent of the interpolation method , the number of grids used , the physical overlap size of the grids ( which was kept fixed while testing convergence ) , and their relative resolutions .",
    "overlapping grids have also been used recently in evolutions of the full einstein equations .",
    "thornburg  @xcite , for example , used six spherical coordinate patches to excise a kerr black hole ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the patches are designed such that coordinate lines in one direction overlay each other , so that the interpolation required is effectively one dimensional . using the bssn formulation ,",
    "thornburg was able to evolve the einstein equations for @xmath2 , and it appeared that the instabilities were related to the outer boundary treatment .",
    "he also used overlapping patches in an apparent horizon solver , which is now available in cactus @xcite .",
    "more recently , anderson and matzner  @xcite have performed simulations of black holes with overlapping grids .",
    "they used two stereographic patches to cover the spherical excision region , and solved the standard @xmath3@xmath4 adm equations in a constrained evolution .",
    "they were able to evolve boosted black holes ( @xmath5 ) across the computational domain , and runs of single , stationary black holes ran for more than @xmath6 .    finally , in a related approach , reula , tiglio and lehner  @xcite use multiple coordinate patches designed such that all boundary points on neighboring patches are aligned . rather than overlapping , the grids just touch .",
    "the communication between the touching grids is based on the carpenter - gottlieb - abarbanel s method @xcite , which requires the computation of the characteristic variables .",
    "they successfully evolved a klein  gordon scalar field on a kerr background spacetime and are currently working towards fully relativistic evolutions .",
    "in this paper we expand upon our previous work , and choose to study improvements in the following directions : ( 1 ) we generalize the background spacetime geometry to allow for spinning black holes , and investigate the effect of high spin ( @xmath7 ) on the system s stability ; ( 2 ) we upgrade our derivative and interpolation operators to give global fourth order accuracy ; ( 3 ) we introduce a spherical patch for the outer boundary , removing all boundary corners .",
    "while in @xcite we put strong emphasis on the use of energy conserving schemes based on difference operators satisfying the summation by parts rule , here we allow ourselves to explore discretizations for which a stability proof based on the discrete energy method is not immediately available . at times",
    ", such discretizations can be much simpler , particularly in the higher order accurate case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : overlapping ] we outline the main ingredients of the overlapping grids method .",
    "[ sec : wave_equation ] is a generalization of sec .",

    "this paper contains three appendices .",
    "when solving hyperbolic initial - boundary value problems numerically , it is often difficult , if not impossible , to accurately represent the entire domain , boundary included , with a single grid .",
    "for example , at least two coordinate patches are required to cover the entire surface of a 3-sphere without coordinate singularities . when solving for the spacetime representing a binary black hole collision",
    ", one may want to use a spherical domain with the outer boundary placed sufficiently far away , in which the black hole singularities are excised . to represent the interior of a sphere with two ( or one after the merger ) smaller spheres removed ,",
    "more than one coordinate system is needed , specially if one wants the coordinates to be adapted to the boundaries of the problem .",
    "the overlapping grids methods provides a simple and flexible solution to such problems .",
    "our scheme is based on that described in starius @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . to demonstrate how the algorithm works we consider the first order linear hyperbolic system @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a vector valued function representing tensor field components , in a domain @xmath10 with smooth boundary @xmath11 .",
    "the problem includes appropriate initial and boundary data . in general , system ( [ eq : u_tpu ] ) is specified in a coordinate system @xmath12 which is not and can not be adapted to the boundary of the problem .",
    "we will refer to this boundary as the physical boundary , and we allow for it to be moving with respect to the main coordinate system .",
    "we introduce a coordinate system @xmath13 adapted to @xmath11 , in the sense that the boundary surface can be represented by @xmath14 , for some @xmath15 .",
    "the equations in this coordinate system will take a different form @xmath16 where the components of @xmath17 are related to the components of @xmath9 via tensor transformation laws .",
    "the initial and boundary data are also transformed . to maintain simultaneity of patches we restrict the coordinate transformation by demanding that @xmath18 .",
    "the problem is discretized by introducing a grid for each coordinate system .",
    "any grid point of the main grid which lies beyond a @xmath19 line ( or surface ) are dropped , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlapgeneral ] . the two grids overlap and the physical overlap size",
    "is kept constant when performing grid refinement tests .",
    "the numerical computation of the right hand side of ( [ eq : u_tpu ] ) at a particular gridpoint @xmath20 requires information from a number of gridpoints in each coordinate direction . with a fourth order accurate centered difference operator , for example",
    ", one needs two gridpoints in each direction .",
    "gridpoints of the main grid , at which the right hand side can not be evaluated , are updated via interpolation from the other grid .",
    "all components of @xmath17 are interpolated onto the main grid and the tensor law transformation is used to evaluate the components of @xmath9 .",
    "a similar procedure is done at the non - physical boundary of the second grid .",
    "points that require interpolation are marked with a solid dot in the figure .",
    "the numerical treatment of the physical boundary is as that of a single grid boundary .    in our code",
    "we use @xmath21-th order lagrange interpolation , which in two dimensions is given by @xmath22 if @xmath23 is sufficiently smooth , the interpolating function is a @xmath21-th order approximation of @xmath24 .    note that if the physical boundary moves with respect to the main grid , gridpoints may have to be dropped from or added to the main grid and the set of points which require interpolation needs continuous updating .",
    "this is done at the end of each full time step of the time integrator of choice ( e.g.  fourth order runge - kutta ) . when grid points are added to the main grid , the grid adapted to the boundary is able to provide accurate data for these points .",
    "the overlapping grids method requires artificial dissipation for stability @xcite .",
    "we use sixth order dissipation , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kodissip ] ) , which has a seven point stencil in each direction .",
    "this means that in our code we actually interpolate three , rather than two gridpoints .",
    "here we consider the case in which a scalar field propagates on a boosted spinning black hole background .",
    "two boundaries are introduced : an inner and an outer boundary .",
    "the first one represents the excision surface and is purely outflow .",
    "it requires no boundary data .",
    "the second one is introduced for computational reasons . we need to have a bounded spatial domain because of limited computational resources .",
    "to handle the two boundaries we introduce two additional coordinate patches .",
    "one patch is adapted to the outer boundary and one patch is co - moving with the black hole , and fixed to the inner excision boundary .",
    "we choose cylindrical coordinates for the main coordinate patch .",
    "the black hole is boosted with velocity @xmath25 along the axis of symmetry with respect to this coordinate system .",
    "spheroidal coordinates are used on the second patch , such that the location of the event horizon is at a constant coordinate value , and spherical coordinates on the outer patch .",
    "we require that all data in all three coordinate systems be simultaneous . by adapting these coordinates to the black hole horizon , we may excise the spherical grid at the event horizon for all values of the boost parameter .",
    "this allows for an efficient use of the excision technique , as we can excise the excisable .",

    "( [ eq : wave2 ] ) as a first order system , @xmath39 an attractive feature of this particular first order reduction is that the constraint variables propagate trivially , namely @xmath40 .",
