    "the calibration from the normal - state response is , for a large part , unaffected by stray capacitances from which coil circuits usually suffer at high frequencies .    whereas a 2d calculation was necessary in the normal - state response , the situation is different in the mixed state because of the strong anisotropy of the critical currents and the flux flow resistivity . in particular , as can be checked experimentally by making @xmath133 , the flux penetration through the lateral faces parallel to the vortices is negligible below @xmath134 .",
    "flux penetration in normal field can thus be regarded as a one - dimensional problem with @xmath135 .",

    "data ( latexmath:[$\\varphi ,    @xmath239 ( then @xmath202 ) had been separately measured , clearly demonstrate these size effects ( see fig.[thinslablossess ] ) .",
    "the fact that for decreasing sample thicknesses size effects are encountered when @xmath262 , _ i.e. _ well before @xmath263 , is not consistent with any one - mode theory ( see sec .  [ introduction ] ) .    according to eq .",
    "( [ thinplateadmittance ] ) , a second size effect occurs in the thin limit when @xmath264 .",
    "this second `` dimensional '' cross - over , which affects now the real part @xmath169 , could wrongly suggest that @xmath200 is a true length in accordance with one - mode approaches .",
    "this shows that one must be careful in interpreting susceptibility measurements .     as a function of @xmath265 in two slabs of the same pbin@xmath266 material with different thickness @xmath267 mm ( @xmath238 ) and @xmath268 mm ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "the skin - depth @xmath269 , or the flux - flow resistivity @xmath219 , is deduced from separate dc voltage - current characteristics .",
    "data points ( @xmath270 ) have been taken at a constant low frequency as a function of magnetic field : @xmath271@xmath272 t and @xmath273@xmath274 mm in the @xmath268 mm slab ; @xmath275@xmath276 t and @xmath277@xmath278 mm in the @xmath267 mm slab .",
    "the theoretical law @xmath279 for the half space is well obeyed in the thick slab with @xmath280 , while a significant deficit in the losses of thin slab is observed for @xmath281@xmath282 . note that , @xmath283@xmath284 m and @xmath285@xmath286 in the same field range , so that no size effect would be expected if @xmath56 was the actual penetration depth .",
    "quantitative comparison with theory is difficult in this thin limit as losses become drastically sensitive to the symmetry of surface conditions ( compare eq .",
    "( [ plateimpedance ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ odd_admittance ] ) ) . ]",
    "let us conclude by briefly examining resistivity measurements in foils within the thin limit .",
    "we refer in this respect to the pioneering work of gittleman and rosenblum @xcite , as also to recent measurements in ybacuo platelets @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such resistivity spectra is much more intricate .",
    "many authors , using this method assume that the current density does not vary along the width @xmath89 of the foil ; this requires the absence of two - dimensional skin - effects , @xmath287 , a condition that is hardly fulfilled over several frequency decades .",
    "the one - dimensional treatment of the ac resistivity relies on the odd solution of eqs .",
    "( [ penetrationb])([penetrationu ] ) .",
    "the effective resistivity of the foil is defined as @xmath288 where @xmath289    in the limit @xmath290 , eqs .",
    "( [ resistivity]),([odd_admittance ] ) reduce to : @xmath291 surprisingly enough , we find the same resistivity spectrum as that given by eq .",
    "( [ campbell ] ) which follows from the bulk - pinning theory .",
    "both eqs .",
    "( [ campbell ] ) and ( [ thin_resistivity ] ) equally fit the gittleman - rosenblum data ( by setting @xmath292 in eq .",
    "( [ thin_resistivity ] ) ) .",
    "we are led to the conclusion that resistivity experiments alone can not decide between very contrasted models of pinning .",
    "we have reported the first comprehensive investigation of dynamic depinning transition in the surface impedance geometry .",
    "it relies on the description of the depinning transition through eq .",
    "( [ admittance ] ) and requires the use of thick samples ( @xmath293 ) .",
    "the agreement is so good that surface - impedance measurements in the rf - domain provide a precise and accurate way of measuring both parameters @xmath200 and @xmath294 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lsandrhofdeb ] , dc data on the flux - flow resistivity , when available , confirm the accuracy of the method ; in other cases where low - level ac techniques are necessary ( large critical currents , ultra - low temperatures ,  ) , the surface impedance becomes the best suited non - invasive method for measuring @xmath219 .",
    "apart from this metrological aspect , it is clear that , as concerns the pinning length @xmath295 , our interpretation is completely at variance with classical views on pinning ( @xcite p. 345 ) . in this respect",
    "we wish to add some comments .",
    "the remarkable agreement with the two - mode spectrum ( [ admittance ] ) as well as the observation of predicted size effects for @xmath262 at low frequencies bring out two important facts : * i ) * the effective length , as deduced from the surface inductance @xmath296 , is _ not _ an actual penetration depth ; * ii ) * free flow is observed in the bulk ( over thicknesses @xmath297 mm ) , in spite of a large density of volume defects in a variety of polycrystalline samples from alloys to pure metals .    in the literature ,",
    "@xmath201 , usually referred to as the campbell penetration depth , is directly expressed in terms of the bulk - pinning labusch parameter @xmath49 ( see sec .",
    "[ introduction ] ) . in soft samples , such as used in this work ,",
    "bulk pinning is commonly analysed in the frame of the collective pinning theory of larkin - ovchinnikov @xcite , where @xmath49 is in turn related to larkin transverse and longitudinal correlation lengths @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "these correlations lengths are intricate expressions of thermodynamic and pinning parameters ( elastic constants @xmath300 and @xmath76 , core radius @xmath301 , pinning - centers concentration @xmath302 and the individual pinning force @xmath303 ) . for thick samples ( 3d collective pinning )",
    "one expects that @xmath304 @xcite .",
    "thus many authors consider the lengths @xmath201 deduced from the low - frequency susceptibility as a routine measurement of @xmath299 and merely investigate the field and temperature dependence of @xmath299 .",
    "this studies must be taken with due caution ; our results show that a spectral analysis should precede any interpretation .",
    "the role of point defects and elastic constants is certainly important in analyzing the short and long - range distortions of the vortex lattice , as observed in a number of techniques ( bitter decoration , neutron scattering , stm ,  ) .",
    "however , our experiments seriously question the relevance of this mechanism of weak pinning in transport properties of soft samples . here",
    ", we indeed exclude the case of hard materials where additional interfaces in the bulk may , to some extent , act like the surfaces of soft samples ( twin planes in ybco @xcite , precipitates in industrial wires ,  ) .",
    "the existence of a free vortex flow in the bulk , and the exclusive role of the surface in the critical - current properties of soft superconductors , have been confirmed in previous experiments under over - critical conditions : for instance the voltage and field noise in the flux - flow regime @xcite , the high - level step - response of a slab in parallel field @xcite , or surface localization of sub - critical currents @xcite ,  we emphasize that these experiments have been specially designed to discriminate surface and bulk currents .",
    "it is clear that the existence of bulk sub - critical currents would imply bulk pinning , but there is up to now no experimental evidence for such bulk currents in soft samples .",
    "in particular one can not , in this respect , rely on the recent hall probe technique , which determines the radial distribution of the current in platelets .",
    "the observed pile - of - sand profile of the magnetic field confirms the critical state model @xcite , but critical state model should not be confused with bulk - pinning model .",
    "the critical - current densities in this geometry may be superficial and the technique used can not resolve the axial distribution .",
