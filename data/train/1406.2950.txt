    "the problem of optimal reinsurance design lies at the heart of reinsurance studies .",
    "a reinsurance policy is a contract , according to which part of the risk of an insurance company ( the ceding company ) is transferred to another insurance company ( the reinsurance company ) , in exchange for receiving a premium .",
    "different reinsurance contracts have been introduced in the reinsurance market among which the quota - share , stop - loss , stop - loss after quota - share and quota - share after stop - loss have received more attention due to their appealing optimality properties .",
    "@xcite ( and also @xcite ) showed that , subject to a budget constraint , the stop - loss policy is an optimal reinsurance contract for the ceding company when the risk is measured by variance ( or by a utility function ) .",
    "recent extensions of the same problem have been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the problem of optimal reinsurance design has been studied by using risk measures and risk premiums , due to their development and application in finance and insurance .",
    "for instance , in a framework where the ceding company s risk is measured either by value at risk ( var ) or conditional tail expectation ( cte ) , with the expected value premium principle as the risk premium , @xcite found the optimal retention levels .",
    "later , in the same framework , @xcite showed that the stop - loss and the quota - share are the most optimal reinsurance contracts . in @xcite",
    "also , the authors have considered optimal risk management strategies of an insurance company subject to regulatory constraints when the risk is measured by var and cvar . in recent years , researchers have tried to extend the optimal reinsurance design problem to larger families of risk measures and risk premiums .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite have extended the problem by using a family of general risk premiums ; in these two papers the risk of the ceding company is measured either by var or cte . on the other hand , @xcite have extended the problem by using general law - invariant convex risk measures , whereas the risk premium is considered to be the expected value premium principle . in the existing literature , either only the family of risk measures or only the family of risk premiums",
    "is extended , while in many applications it is desirable to extend both at the same time .",
    "the present paper , considers a framework which extends , at the same time , the set of risk measures and the risk premiums to the family of distortion risk measures and premiums .",
    "first , we show that in this framework the ceding , the reinsurance and the social planner problems can be formulated in the same way .",
    "second , we characterize the optimal solutions by introducing the notion of marginal indemnification function . a marginal indemnification function is the marginal rate of changes in the value of a reinsurance contract .",
    "we show that any optimal solution to the reinsurance problem has a marginal indemnification function which only takes the values zero and one . remarkably , we can separate the roles of the market preferences and premiums and that of the total risk are separated .",
    "finally , we have to point out that , by using a very simple fact that any lipschitz continuous function has a derivative that is bounded by its lipschitz constant , we introduce a useful technique in this paper that can generalize many already existing results to the distortion risk measures and risk premiums .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the families of distortion risk measures and risk premiums contain very important particular cases ; for instance , the family of the co - monotone sub - additive law invariant coherent risk measures es ( @xcite ) , the family of generalized spectral risk measures ( @xcite ) , the generalized distortion measures of risk ( @xcite ) , wang s risk premiums ( @xcite and @xcite ) , expected value premium principle and many others .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 introduces the mathematical notions and notations that we use in this paper . in section 3 the general set - up of the ceding",
    ", the reinsurance and the social planner problems will be presented . in section 4",
    "the results on characterizing the optimal reinsurance contracts will be presented . in section 5",
    "we provide some corollaries and examples .",
    "let @xmath0 be a probability space , where @xmath1 is the `` states of the nature '' , @xmath2 is the physical probability measure and @xmath3 is the @xmath4- field of measurable subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath5 $ ] be two numbers such that @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the space of all random variables with @xmath7th finite moment with @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the expectation w.r.t @xmath2 . recall that according to the riesz representation theorem , @xmath11 is the dual space of @xmath8 when @xmath12 . recall also",
    "that the space @xmath8 is endowed with two topologies , first the norm topology induced by @xmath13 , and second the weak topology , induced by @xmath11 i.e. the coarsest topology in which all members of @xmath11 are continuous .",
    "the set of all random variables on @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "if instead of @xmath1 we used @xmath15 the same definitions and statements hold .    in this paper",
    ", we consider only two period of time , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath16 represents the beginning of the year , when a contract is written , and @xmath17 represents the end of the year , when liabilities are settled .",
    "every random variable represents losses at time @xmath17 . for any @xmath18 , the cumulative distribution function associated with @xmath19",
    "is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a non - decreasing real function from @xmath22 $ ] to @xmath22 $ ] such that @xmath23 .",
    "a distortion risk measure @xmath24 ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) is a mapping from @xmath8 to the set of real numbers @xmath15 and is introduced as could be any member of @xmath8 .",
    "actually , this is a particular form of the choquet integral , when the capacity @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , for any measurable set @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28    where @xmath29 is the survival function associated with @xmath19 . in the literature , @xmath21 is known as the distortion function .",
    "a more convenient representation for a distortion risk measure can be found in terms of value at risk .",
    "let @xmath30 . by a simple change of variable , one can see that the distortion form can be represented as @xmath31 where @xmath32.\\ ] ] in the sequel , the risk measure @xmath24 above is denoted by @xmath33 to show its connection with @xmath34",
    ". a popular example of a distortion risk measure is value at risk , introduced earlier , where @xmath35}(t)$ ] .",
    "a conditional value at risk ( cvar ) is a distortion risk measure whose distortion function is given by @xmath36}(t)$ ] , and can be represented as @xmath37    the family of spectral risk measures which was introduced first in @xcite , has the same representation as , where @xmath34 is also convex .",
    "one can readily see that @xmath33 is positive homogeneity , translation invariant , monotone , law invariance and comonotonic additive .",
    "it can be shown that all law - invariant co - monotone additive coherent risk measures can be represented as ; see @xcite .",
    "a risk measure in the form is important from different perspectives .",
    "first of all it makes a link between the risk measures theory and the behavioral finance as the form is a particular form of choquet utility .",
    "second , contains a family of risk measures which are statistically robust .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that a risk measure @xmath38 is robust if and only if the support of @xmath39 ( the derivative is in general a distribution and not a function ) is away from zero and one .",
    "for example value at risk is a risk measure with this property .    for more reading on distortion risk measures",
    "one can see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a risk premium in general is introduced as a continuous mapping on @xmath40 which maps any loss variable to a number representing its premium .",
    "a general definition for the risk premium in the literature is proposed by @xcite in an axiomatic manner .",
    "@xcite characterize the family of cash invariant , positive homogeneous , co - monotone additive risk premiums which satisfy the following continuity property    @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43\\to[0,1]$ ] is a non - decreasing function such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "when the function @xmath21 is convex the premium is called wang s premium principle .    by similar change of variable for risk measures (",
    "i.e. , @xmath30 ) , the following equality holds for a premium represented in    @xmath46    let @xmath47\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] be a non - decreasing function such that @xmath48 .",
    "the distortion premium @xmath49 is introduced as @xmath50    a popular example of a distortion risk premium is a wang s premium is convex we also call a distortion premium a wang premium . ]",
    "introduced by the following distortion function known as wang s transformation    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a real number and @xmath53 is the cdf of the normal distribution with the mean equal to zero and the standard deviation equal to one .",
    "in this section , we set up the optimal reinsurance design problem for the ceding company , the reinsurance company and the social planner , and , show that they can be expressed in a unifying framework . although , we do not need to introduce the ceding and the reinsurance companies , as they are known in the literature of actuarial science , we introduce briefly the social planner : the social planner is a decision - maker who is concerned with maximizing the total welfare , which in our setting is minimizing the total risk .",
    "social planner is different than the regulator , as they have different concerns , for example a regulator would ask companies to hold a minimum capital reserve even if it goes against the maximality of the economic welfare .",
    "let us denote the annual risk of an insurance company by a non - negative loss variable @xmath54 . in general , a reinsurance company will accept to cover part of the risk , in exchange for receiving a premium .",
    "let us denote the part of the risk covered by the re - insurer by @xmath55 and the part covered by the insurance company by @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that @xmath57 .",
    "the premium received by the reinsurance company is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a relative safety loading .",
    "therefore , the global loss of the ceding company , denoted by @xmath60 , can be expressed as    @xmath61    in the same manner for the re - insurer we have    @xmath62    we introduce three problems as follows    * * ceding problem . *",
    "the ceding company minimizes its total risk by solving the following problem @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a risk measure used by the insurance company . * * reinsurance problem . *",
    "the re - insurer tries to find the best @xmath55 which minimizes its total risk @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a risk measure used by the reinsurance company . * * social planner problem . * the social planner",
    "is concerned with the best allocation @xmath67 minimizing the economy s total risk @xmath68    by cash - invariance property of distortion risk measures , we can rewrite these problems as follows    * * ceding problem .",
    "*    @xmath69    * * reinsurance problem .",
    "* @xmath70 * * social planner problem .",
    "* @xmath71    now we assume that both the ceding and retained loss variables are non - decreasing functions of the global loss variable .",
    "this assumption rules out the risk of moral hazard , as both sides have to feel any increase in the global loss ( see@xcite and @xcite for further discussions on moral hazard and insurance ) .",
    "therefore , the set of admissible ceding loss functions is defined as    @xmath72 the set @xmath73 is known as the space of _ indemnification functions_.    let us assume that @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the ceding , reinsurance and the social planner problems can be unified in the following general framework @xmath76 where @xmath77 are either distortion risk measure or premium and @xmath78 are positive numbers .    the problem is naturally in the form , if @xmath79 .",
    "note that if @xmath75 then @xmath80 also belongs to @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , can be written in the form if @xmath81 .",
    "now , we only need to show that can be written in the form of .",
    "let @xmath82 . from construction",
    ", we know that @xmath83 belongs to @xmath73 and that @xmath84 .",
    "it is known that @xmath85 commutes with non - decreasing functions , given this fact @xmath86 therefore , the reinsurance problem can be written as @xmath87 except the second part , which is a constant number , the first part is in the form of .    before moving on further into our discussions",
    ", we would like to remark on some facts regarding the ceding , reinsurance and the social planner problems .    observe that if both the ceding and the reinsurance company use the same risk measure @xmath24 , by using the fact that @xmath85 commutes with non - deceasing functions , we have    @xmath88    this means , no matter what contract the ceding and reinsurance companies use , as far as there is no risk of moral hazard in the reinsurance market , the total risk remains constant .",
    "this is likely if the regulator imposes a unique risk measure to be used by all companies , for example the same @xmath89 , for the capital reserve . on the other hand",
    ", this fact has a serious implication , that , if ceding company minimizes his / her global risk by using a contract @xmath90 , the same contract will maximize the reinsurance company s global risk . and",
    "even further , if @xmath91 minimizes the risk of the ceding company , @xmath92 will also minimize the risk of the reinsurance company .",
    "this is in contrast with reciprocal - reinsurance - treaties .",
    "it is known that @xmath93 is co - monotone additive , which implies that any distortion risk measure or premium is also co - monotone additive .",
    "this implies that every distortion risk or premium is linear on a set of co - monotone random variables ; in particular it is linear on the following admissible space of solutions    @xmath94 if we denote the function @xmath95 by @xmath96 then we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , for @xmath101 .",
    "it is known if a function @xmath102 is lipschitz continuous , it is almost everywhere differentiable and its derivative is essentially bounded by its lipschitz constant .",
    "therefore , function @xmath102 can be written as the integral of its derivative . as a result @xmath73",
    "can be represented as    @xmath103 we introduce the space of _ marginal indemnification functions _ as    @xmath104    for any indemnification function @xmath75 , the associated marginal indemnification is a function @xmath105 such that @xmath106    the interpretation of a marginal indemnification function is as follows : if @xmath107 is a contract , then at each value @xmath108 , a marginal change @xmath109 to the value of the global loss will result in marginal change of the cedant risk at the size @xmath110 .",
    "we will see in the following that in our framework the marginal change of an optimal contract is either @xmath16 or @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "in this section , we restrict our attention to a family of distortion risk measures and premiums which satisfy the following regularity condition    @xmath112    introduce @xmath113 and @xmath114 as follows    @xmath115    and    @xmath116    where @xmath117 could be any function between @xmath16 and @xmath118 on @xmath119 . here",
    "we state our main result    if @xmath120 and @xmath121 satisfy , the solutions to the general optimization problem is given by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is given by and .",
    "the value at minimum is also given by @xmath124    it is very important to see that @xmath123 only depends on market preferences and premiums , and therefore , it is universal .",
    "also one can see how the role of the total risk and the market preferences are separated .    since @xmath125 and @xmath126 are both non - decreasing , and also since @xmath127 commute with monotone functions , we get @xmath128 using the representation we have already introduced for the members of @xmath73 in terms of the members of @xmath129 , there exists @xmath105 such that @xmath107 . therefore , we have @xmath130 first , we assume @xmath54 is bounded . by fubini s theorem ,",
    "gives @xmath131 where in the last line we use the fact that @xmath132 .",
    "it is clear that the following @xmath114 will minimize @xmath133 where @xmath134 could be any function between zero and one on @xmath135 .",
    "since we are free to choose the values of @xmath114 on @xmath136 , we may equalize it either to 0 or 1 .",
    "the value of the minimum also is equal to @xmath137 by a simple change of variable @xmath138 , we get the result for bounded @xmath54 .",
    "now let us in general assume that @xmath54 is not bounded .",
    "it is clear that at each point @xmath139 , @xmath140 are non - increasing with respect to @xmath141 . on the other hand , for any @xmath139 , there exist @xmath142 such that if @xmath143 then @xmath144 . therefore , for any @xmath139 , we have that @xmath145 .",
    "now by monotone convergence theorem we have that @xmath146 for any function @xmath105 . using this fact , our continuity assumption and that @xmath102 is non - decreasing we have @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "this simply results in @xmath149 the rest of the proof follows the same lines after .",
    "in this section , we use the theory we have developed in last sections to find the optimal solutions for particular cases .",
    "however before that , we consider further assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the cumulative distribution function @xmath150 and the distortion function @xmath151 are strictly increasing ; for instance when @xmath54 is the value of a compound poisson process with exponential claims at time @xmath17 , and @xmath152 is expectation or wang s premium . on the other hand , we assume @xmath153 and @xmath154 , when @xmath155 is a relative safety load . in the literature when @xmath156 or @xmath157 is used ,",
    "it is assumed usually that @xmath158 .",
    "given that @xmath159 is always a number very close to @xmath118 , ( usually @xmath160 $ ] ) , it means that @xmath155 has to be small , precisely , smaller than @xmath161 . in the following , we assume a different assumption that @xmath162 note that if @xmath155 is a small enough this assumption always holds .",
    "let @xmath163 and @xmath164 be two real numbers such that @xmath165 and @xmath166 and let @xmath167 .",
    "we know that since @xmath168 , @xmath170}(t)$ ] . therefore , @xmath171 the second line in definition of @xmath172 above is clearly non - negative .",
    "the first line is non - negative if @xmath173 and @xmath174 given that @xmath175 , this is equivalent to say that @xmath176 and @xmath177 ; or in sum @xmath178 on the other hand , since by assumption @xmath179 , then @xmath180 .",
    "this implies that @xmath181 .",
    "hence , @xmath172 is non - positive on interval @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 is given as @xmath183 by integrating @xmath184 over @xmath139 , @xmath185        in this case @xmath190}$ ] and therefore , @xmath191 to discover the structure of @xmath114 , we have to see when @xmath172 is non - negative .",
    "the analysis is very similar to the corollary [ cor:1 ] , except that , we need to find out when the second line in the definition of @xmath172 is non - negative .",
    "first of all , observe that at @xmath192 , the second line in the definition of @xmath172 becomes @xmath193 , which by assumption @xmath194 , yields @xmath195 .",
    "this shows that in the area @xmath196 , @xmath172 can be negative ( unlike the previous corollary ) .",
    "since @xmath151 is convex , the second line in the definition of @xmath172 is a convex function of @xmath197 which is zero at @xmath198 .",
    "since we have shown @xmath172 is negative at @xmath192 , we infer that there exists a solution @xmath199 to @xmath200 , strictly greater than @xmath201 , such that @xmath172 is non - negative between @xmath199 and @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , @xmath202 this shows that , similar to the case that the ceding company s risk measure is @xmath93 , the optimal reinsurance for @xmath157 is again stop - loss , but with a greater liability @xmath203 .",
    "let us again consider the ceding problem .",
    "assume that the ceding risk measure is @xmath157 and the risk premium for the reinsurance company is a wang s premium given as in .",
    "again we fix a relative safety load .",
    "one can find @xmath172 as follows @xmath205}\\left(f_{x_{0}}(t)\\right)-(1+\\rho)\\left(1-\\phi(\\phi^{-1}(1-f_{x_{0}}(t))+\\beta)\\right)\\right).\\ ] ]    in the figures 1 and 2 we have depicted @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively , for different scenarios .",
    "as one can see in all case we have a policy @xmath114 associated with a stop - loss policy . from the figure 1",
    ", one can see that if @xmath208 is small , it is more likely that the policy becomes a degenerate policy , by transferring the whole risk to the reinsurance company , for all levels of risk aversion . on the other hand , by looking at the figure 2 , with a fixed @xmath208 , one can see that the higher the level of risk aversion is the higher the retention level is . even at level @xmath209",
    "one can see that the policy is a degenerate policy , and all the risk is transferred to the reinsurance company .",
    "let us consider that the ceding company uses @xmath93 and the reinsurance company @xmath212 , when @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath214 this shows that @xmath215 , and therefore , the ceding company should not transfer any part of her risk to the reinsurance company . in the opposite direction if @xmath216 , the same is true for the reinsurance company , that means the reinsurance company has to accept the whole risk .",
