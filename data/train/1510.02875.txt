    "the @xmath1-queens problem is the problem of placing @xmath1 queens on an @xmath1 by @xmath1 chessboard such that none are attacking each other .",
    "this puzzle originated as the @xmath2-queens problem played on a standard @xmath3 chessboard and was proposed by max bezzel in 1848  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-queens problem and the more general @xmath1-queens problem attracted the interest of notable mathematicians of that time . in 1850 , nauck was the first to publish all 92 solutions for the standard @xmath3 chessboard  @xcite and in 1874 pauls gives the first set of solutions for the general @xmath1-queens problem published in two articles  @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding more solutions in various dimensions has continued to hold the interest of mathematicians and computer scientists .",
    "solutions sets have been found using graph theory , magic squares , latin squares , and group theory , among other techniques . in a brute force approach ,",
    "solution sets for a given @xmath1 can be found use the backtracking algorithm , a standard technique taught in computer science classes . in more modern times , a player can find numerous mobile apps to test his ability to find solutions on @xmath3 or other dimensional boards .    in this paper , we look at a game variant of the @xmath1-queens problem that can be played on chessboards of varying dimensions . the basic version of the @xmath1-queens game is described by noon in  @xcite , who , observing that not all placements of queens will lead to a full solutions with @xmath1 queens , suggests a two player game where each player successively places queens in non - attacking positions .",
    "the first player who can not place a queen loses the game . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a modification of this @xmath1-queens game .",
    "sections  [ complete ] and  [ locked ] discuss two states a game board may take .",
    "then section  [ alternate ] will discuss alternate versions of the game , while section  [ graph ] looks at the complexity of the game .",
    "we begin by observing that counting all possible arrangement of queens which satisfy noon s @xmath1-queens game can be quite complicated .",
    "this can be illustrated by using a gradient to indicate the number of queens attacking each square on the chessboard , with white indicating an open square and darker shades indicating an increasing number of queens attacking that square .",
    "figure  [ gradient_board ] displays an example of such a chessboard .",

    "a * complete * chessboard contains @xmath5 queens that have been placed through legal game play .",

    "let us review some chessboard terminology    each square on a @xmath0 chessboard will be indexed by an * ordered pair * @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates the row numbered from top to bottom and @xmath8 indicates the column numbered from left to right .",

    "_ strategy _ : thinking inductively , a @xmath15 chessboard may be filled with one queen , and if we want to fill a @xmath16 board we need to fill the top two rows and left two columns with queens as well as the @xmath15 board in the lower right corner . more generally , to fill a @xmath0 board we need to fill the top two rows , the left two columns , and a @xmath17 board in the lower right corner . looking at the game position where queens have filled the first two rows and the first two columns of the chessboard as illustrated in figure  [ unlocked_11 ] in the case @xmath18 , we observe that every uncovered square on this chessboard can be attacked by an even number of queens .",
    "@endgroupori@endgroup @endgroup@endgroupori @whitefieldmaskcolor @blackfieldmaskcolor @whitefieldcolor @blackfieldcolor    specifically , each square can be attacked vertically , horizontally , and along the difference diagonal by exactly two queens on each line .",

    "can be attacked by all @xmath48 queens on the board , we can place the final queen in this position and hence lock the board .",
    "we can find a locked board in the case where @xmath1 is even as well .",
    "for @xmath1 an even positive integer and @xmath49 , the chessboard with queens on squares in the set @xmath50 is a legal , locked game position .",
    "we encourage you to check that this chessboard is locked and arises from a sequence of legal game moves .",
    "we can now make the following observation .",
    "when @xmath1 is an odd positive integer , at most @xmath51 queens are needed to lock the board , and when @xmath1 is an even positive integer , at most @xmath52 queens are needed to lock the board .",
    "this corollary gives an upper bound on the number of queens need to lock an even or odd chessboard , but is this bound strict ?",
    "we know for very small values of @xmath1 the chessboard can be locked with fewer queens , but what about larger values ? we pose the next question .",
    "what is the minimum number of queens needed to lock a @xmath0 chessboard ?",
    "next , we will look at different versions of the game with alternate rules and the connections between them .",
    "thus far , we have seen that there is a difference in outcomes for chessboards with even and odd length , that is , with parity zero or one modulo two respectively .",
    "the rules of the game as well could be modified along the same lines .",
    "let s look at the alternative version of the game where queens can be placed on squares that are attacked by an _",
    "odd _ number of queens .",
    "we will call such a game an * alternate universe mod 2 @xmath4-queens game*.    the first observation of course is that generally this can not happen as an empty board has no squares attacked by on odd number of queens , so we will modify the rules again to start with one queen already on the board before we commence play . from a strategy standpoint , in this alternate universe game a new queen can not be placed unless she is  covered \" by an odd number of queens .",
    "a second way to play the game would be to start with @xmath5 queens on the board and try to remove the queens one by one following the rule that a queen may be removed as long as she can be attacked by an even number of queens .",
    "we call such a game an * complementary mod 2 @xmath4-queens game*. the relationship between alternate universe , complementary games , and standard mod 2 @xmath1-queens games is dependent on the size of the chessboard .    when @xmath1 is an even positive integer , the alternate universe mod 2 @xmath1-queens games are in bijection with complementary mod 2 @xmath1-queens games .",
    "earlier we saw that if an even length chessboard is fully covered with queens , each square is attacked by an odd number of queens . the initial step for both games in the same .",
    "we place one queen in the alternate universe and remove one queen from the same square in the full complementary game .",
    "while playing the complementary game , queens can only be removed if the number of queens attacking is even and hence because of the parity of the board , it means the number of empty squares  attacking \" must be odd . by taking the complement of the board , removing queens to make empty squares , and placing queens on otherwise empty squares , we can go back and forth from the complementary game to the alternate universe game .",
    "it is interesting to note that the alternate universe game on the odd length chessboards does not have the same relationship .",
    "in fact , we have the following :    when @xmath1 is an odd positive integer , the complementary mod 2 @xmath1-queens games are in bijection with standard mod 2 @xmath1-queens games .    in this case , the beginning parity for every square on a complementary game board is even .",
    "we obtain the bijection by placing a queen in the same square of the standard game from which we removed it in the complementary game .",
    "thus for each case , even or odd length chessboard , there is really only two different games to be played , standard and alternate universe , as the complementary game can be completely reconstructed from one of the other two games .",
    "we conclude this section with an open - ended question .",
    "what other @xmath1-queens games can be played on a @xmath0 chessboard ?",
    "in particular , how could we adapt play for a * mod k @xmath4-queens game * ?    in the next section",
    "we will discuss the complexity of the game and give examples of a game tree and a graph created from this tree .",
    "chess and other games played with chess pieces are complex games .",
    "we will discuss several standard measures of complexity of a game for the mod 2 @xmath1-queens game . a * game tree * is the rooted tree whose root is the empty board and whose leaves are locked or complete boards such that the directed paths from the root to a leaf display all possible games .",
    "figure  [ game_tree ] shows the first three levels of the game tree in the case where @xmath41 .",
    "many of the game boards represented by these nodes are identical or symmetric by rotation or reflection .",
    "in fact , any given game board has up to eight symmetric boards . to simplify the structure of this tree , we propose to combine nodes describing boards which are equivalent by symmetry . in this case",
    ", we have fewer nodes , but the tree has become a graph .",
    "figure  [ fullgraph ] shows the full graph for @xmath54 .",
    "this graph is still quite large even for smallest non - trivial value for @xmath1 .",
    "observe that that the first node is the empty board , the last board is the full board , and each of the solid nodes correspond to a locked board .",
    "we are also interested in the complexity of the game . because , for some @xmath1 , all possible squares may be filled , we have a finite set of @xmath5 squares ; any subset of which could be filled with queens .",
    "this set of all subsets of @xmath5 elements is the power set which has size of @xmath55 .",
    "since defining rules for the board limits the number of game boards , @xmath55 is the upper bound for the * state - space complexity * or number of legal game positions .",
    "therefore we have a complexity @xmath56 and this game is in exptime ."
