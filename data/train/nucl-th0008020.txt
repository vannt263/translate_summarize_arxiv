    "bound free pair production is one of the new types of processes that occur in relativistic collisions of atoms and ions .",
    "it is the production of an electron - positron pair with the electron not produced as a free state but as a bound state of one of the ions : @xmath0    this process changes the charge state of the ion . due to the change in the charge - to - mass ratio , such an ion will be lost from the circulating beam and the luminosity will be seriously affected .",
    "together with the electromagnetic dissociation this process is the dominant beam loss process at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern when using heavy ions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the beam loss itself , it was recently discussed in @xcite that the capture process can lead to localized beampipe heating .",
    "this could cause magnet quenches if the local cooling is inadequate .",
    "therefore it is very important to know this cross section with high accuracy and reliability .",
    "we want to mention also that the corresponding process using antiprotons as the `` target '' has recently found an application in the production and detection of relativistic antihydrogen , see @xcite . in a collision of the antiprotons with a target again electron positron pairs are produced .",
    "the positron can be produced in a bound state of the antiproton forming an antihydrogen atom . using the equivalent photon method ,",
    "this cross section was calculated in @xcite . in the equivalent photon approximation",
    ", the cross section factorizes into a photo - induced cross section and an equivalent photon spectrum .",
    "this spectrum depends on a cut - off parameter which should be chosen appropriately . using the pwba expression for",
    "the cross section one can avoid this ambiguity and see also how this parameter should be chosen .",
    "this was done in @xcite and @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "differential as well as total cross sections are given as a function of the collision energy .",
    "whereas in the latter reference approximate lepton wave functions appropriate for low values of @xmath1 , the charge of the antiproton , have been used , exact dirac wave functions , which are valid also for higher values of @xmath1 , have been used in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to calculate the cross - sections for the energy region of the colliders rhic and lhc exactly within the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) or ( which is equivalent ) the semiclassical straight line approximation ( sca ) , including also higher shells .",
    "previously , such kinds of calculations were done using the weizscker - williams method @xcite .",
    "higher order effects ( in the interaction with the projectile ) have been considered by a number of groups , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "recently exact calculations have been done in the high energy limit by baltz @xcite .",
    "he finds that that the contributions from higher orders are rather small ( of the 1% level ) and even tend to decrease the cross section .",
    "this is in contrast to results found at much smaller energies with lorentz factors in the target rest frame @xmath2 @xcite , but see also @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_pwba ] we extend the formalism presented in @xcite to the relativistic heavy ion case , including now also formulae for the higher atomic states .",
