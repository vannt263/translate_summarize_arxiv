    "the aim of the present lecture notes is to give an elementary introduction to some aspects of black hole ( bh ) physics @xcite@xcite in @xmath3 space - time dimensions , as well as an overview of some recent developments on the so - called _ attractor mechanism _",
    "@xcite @xcite for extremal bhs , as they appear in @xmath3 supergravity with a number @xmath4 of local supersymmetry @xcite @xcite ( for further developments , see also _",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "supergravity may be regarded as the low - energy limit ( in a small curvature expansion ) of some candidates for a quantum theory of gravity such as _ superstring theory _ @xcite@xcite or _",
    "m - theory _ @xcite . in situations where higher curvature effects may be neglected",
    ", the gravity part of the theory reduces to the einstein - hilbert action coupled to a certain number of matter fields , whose specific content depends on the particular low - energy theory",
    ". typically , these fields are ( _ moduli _ ) scalars , spin @xmath5 fermions , spin @xmath6 gauge fields ( abelian in our examples ) and spin @xmath7 fermions , the gravitinos .",
    "the latter ones , @xmath4 in numbers , are the gauge fields of local supersymmetry .",
    "in this situation , asymptotically flat charged bh solutions , within a static and spherically symmetric _ ansatz _ , can be regarded as a generalization of the famous schwarzschild bh .",
    "however , the presence of additional quantum numbers ( such as charges and scalar hair ) make their properties change drastically , and new phenomena appear . a novel important feature of electrically ( and/or magnetically ) charged bhs @xcite as well as rotating ones @xcite is a somewhat unconventional thermodynamical property named _ extremality _ ( _ i.e. _ zero temperature , as we will see below ) @xcite .",
    "extremal bhs are possibly stable gravitational objects with finite entropy but vanishing temperature , in which case the contribution to the gravitational energy entirely comes from the electromagnetic ( charges ) and rotational @xcite ( angular momentum / spin ) attributes .",
    "_ extremality _ also means that the inner ( cauchy ) and outer ( event ) horizons do coincide , thus implying vanishing surface gravity ( see sects .",
    "[ sect2 ] and [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "the extremal situation entails a particular relation between the entropy , charges and spin , since in this case the gravitational mass is not an independent quantity .",
    "four dimensional stationary and spherically symmetric bhs in an environment of scalar fields ( typically described by a non - linear sigma model ) , have scalar hair ( _ scalar charges _ ) , corresponding to the values of the scalars at ( asymptotically flat ) spatial infinity .",
    "these values may continuously vary , being an arbitrary point in the moduli space of the theory or , in a more geometrical language , a point in the target manifold of the scalar non - linear lagrangian @xcite . nevertheless , the bh entropy , as given by the bekenstein - hawking entropy - area formula @xcite , is also in this case independent on the scalar charges ( _ `` no scalar hair '' _ ) and it only depends on the asymptotic ( generally _ dyonic _ ) bh charges ( see sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) .",
    "this apparent puzzle can be resolved thanks to the so - called _ attractor mechanism _ ( see sect . [ sect2 ] ) , a fascinating phenomenon that combines extremal bhs , dynamical systems , algebraic geometry and number theory @xcite .",
    "it was firstly discovered in the context of supergravity ; in a few words , in constructing extremal dyonic bhs of @xmath8 , @xmath3 supergravity coupled to vector and hypermultiplets ( with no @xmath3 scalar potential ) , two phenomena occur : the hyperscalars can take arbitrary constant values , while the radial evolution of the vector multiplets scalars is described by a dynamical system @xcite . under some mild assumptions ,",
    "the scalar trajectory flows to a `` fixed point '' , located at the bh event horizon , in the target ( moduli ) space .",
    "the `` fixed point '' ( _ i.e. _ a point of vanishing _ phase velocity _ ) represents the system in equilibrium , and it is the analogue of an _ attractor _ in the dynamical flow of dissipative systems . in approaching such an _ attractor _ , the orbits lose practically all memory of initial conditions ( _ i.e. _ of the scalar hair ) , even though the dynamics is fully deterministic .",
    "the scalars at the bh horizon turn out to depend only on the dyonic ( asymptotic ) charges .    for @xmath9bps ( _ i.e. _ supersymmetric ) , @xmath8 attractors all the scalars are fixed @xcite , and one deals with the _ attractor varieties _ , which have their own interest in algebraic geometry and number theory @xcite .",
    "for the so - called `` large '' bhs , within the einstein approximation , the entropy can be shown to be proportional to a suitably defined _ bh effective potential _",
    "( positive definite function in the moduli space ) computed ( for fixed bh electric and magnetic charges ) at its critical point(s ) , reached at the horizon . all extremal static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat bhs in @xmath3 have a bertotti - robinson @xcite @xmath10 near - horizon geometry , with vanishing scalar curvature and conformally flat ; in particular , the radius of @xmath11 coincides with the radius of @xmath12 , and it is proportional to the ( square root of the ) bh entropy ( in turn proportional , through the bekenstein - hawking formula @xcite , to the area of the event horizon ) .",
    "non - bps ( _ i.e. _ non - supersymmetric ) ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) extremal bhs exist as well , and they also exhibit an attractor behavior .",
    "however , in this case not all vector multiplets scalars are stabilized in terms of bh conserved charges at the event horizon , but rather some of them remain , at least at the classical level , `` flat '' directions , as is the case for hyperscalars @xcite . in spite of this , the entropy of non - bps bhs enjoys the same property of their supersymmetric counterparts , namely it only depends on the dyonic bh charges @xcite .",
    "when the scalar manifold is an homogeneous symmetric space @xcite ( as it is always the case for all @xmath13 , @xmath3 extended supergravities ) , the theory of extremal bh attractors has a beautiful connection to group theory and differential geometry . in this framework",
    ", the bps or non - bps nature of bh attractors can be related to the theory of orbits of the dyonic ( asymptotic ) charge vector @xcite : different orbits correspond to different supersymmetry - preserving features of the fixed points of the scalar dynamics .",
    "all `` non - flat '' directions are _ attractive _ , which means that the hessian matrix the bh effective potential is semi - positive definite @xcite .",
