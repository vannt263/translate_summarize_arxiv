    "<S> let us consider first the textbook case of an incident plane wave and a square envelope ( see e.g.  @xcite for an analytical treatment of the problem ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2(a ) shows the transmission coefficient for a lattice of @xmath11  sites , calculated by solving numerically the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> for a given velocity @xmath12 , one observes that the transmission coefficient essentially switches between 0 and 1 as a function of the depth of the lattice @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be interpreted as follows . at the entrance </S>",
    "<S> , the incoming state of energy @xmath13 is projected onto the eigenstates of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the associated eigenenergies distribute into energy bands  @xcite whose position can be expressed in terms of the characteristic functions of the mathieu equation  @xcite as depicted by the white dashed lines in fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> reflection occurs if @xmath14 lies in the gap between two allowed energy bands . due to the finite length of the lattice </S>",
    "<S> the energy bands are not strictly continuous and resolve into @xmath15 separate states for vanishing incident velocity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> undersampling of the image gives rise to the ` foamy ' aspect of the low - velocity side of transmission bands . obviously , the reflection by an _ attractive _ potential is a purely quantum effect , with no classical counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> a second interesting feature appears in the limit of a vanishing potential depth @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> one still observes reflection but it occurs only for incident velocities of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an integer ( see the white arrows on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to bragg s condition @xmath18  @xcite , where @xmath19 for retroreflection , and @xmath20 is the incident de broglie wavelength of the atoms : the reflection amplitude at each lattice site is small but constructive interference between all the reflected waves results in a macroscopic reflected wave building up . for the range of parameters of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , quantum reflection by a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ lattice well occurs only for velocities that are very small as compared to @xmath21  @xcite and thus can not explain the observed features .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the result of the same calculation , but now for the experimentally relevant case of a lattice having a smooth gaussian envelope . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly observes a drastic change in the dependence of the transmission coefficient : for a fixed velocity @xmath12 , the transmission is essentially equal to one only _ below _ a critical value @xmath22 of the lattice depth , and then goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> that critical value corresponds to the smallest one at which total reflection would occur for the square envelope lattice . </S>",
    "<S> no resurgence of the transmission is observed if @xmath5 is further increased which gives a ` sawtooth ' appearance to the boundary between reflection and transmission .    </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we are in the _ slowly varying envelope _ limit as @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the lattice does not change appreciably over a few sites , and thus one can consider that , locally , the matterwave interacts with a constant - amplitude lattice . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath24 the reflection condition is met at the center of the lattice i.e. at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> then , when @xmath5 increases , there are some locations @xmath26 , on both sides of the center , for which @xmath27 and where reflection occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a fabry - perot resonator made of two bragg mirrors , analog to vcsels for example . as in optics , </S>",
    "<S> transmission exhibits sharp resonances which gives the same foamy aspect as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we now come to the experimental realization . </S>",
    "<S> our technique to produce all - optical becs has been described in details elsewhere  @xcite ; in what follows we thus simply recall the major steps . </S>",
    "<S> we produce an almost pure @xmath28 condensate containing typically @xmath29 atoms by forced evaporation over 4  s in a crossed optical dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> it is made of two intersecting beams with a wavelength of 1070  nm . </S>",
    "<S> a horizontal one , with a waist of @xmath30 , to be used later as a guide for the bec , defines the @xmath31 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the second , the ` dimple ' beam , of waist @xmath32 , propagates along the @xmath33 direction , @xmath34 being the vertical ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> spin distillation using a magnetic field gradient during evaporation  @xcite results in the bec being prepared in the state @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we then decrease adiabatically the power in the dimple beam by a factor @xmath36 over 80  ms , thus barely keeping a longitudinal confinement for the bec , before switching it off abruptly to outcouple a wavepacket in the horizontal guide . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we produce a wavepacket with a small longitudinal velocity dispersion . to set the wavepacket in motion , </S>",
    "<S> we then switch on a coil , coaxial with the guide , that produces an inhomogeneous magnetic field . through the quadratic zeeman effect </S>",
    "<S> the wavepacket is accelerated for typically 15  ms to a final mean velocity @xmath0 between 2 and 15 mm@xmath37s . </S>",
    "<S> the residual acceleration of the packet due to stray fields and beams curvature is negligible ( we measure an upper bound of @xmath38 ) .    centered 250  @xmath39 m downstream from the dimple location @xmath40 , the optical lattice is produced at the intersection of two beams with a wavelength @xmath41  nm ( red - detuned with respect to the @xmath42rb d1 and d2 lines ) and a waist @xmath43  @xmath39 m , linearly polarized along @xmath34 , crossing at an angle @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice detuning is large enough so that spontaneous emission does not play any role on our experimental timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting lattice spacing is @xmath45\\simeq 650 $ ]  nm . in a set of preliminary experiments we calibrate the potential depth @xmath5 using kapitza - dirac diffraction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a bec is created at the position of the lattice and exposed to the lattice potential for a short time @xmath46 , typically a few tens of microseconds . the diffraction pattern of the bec after time of flight as a function of @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> is then compared to numerical simulations of the process . </S>",
    "<S> a typical 35  mw per beam results in @xmath5 up to @xmath47 .    after being launched as described above , the wave packet propagates in the horizontal guide for an adjustable time @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> then all the lasers are switched off abruptly and the cloud is imaged by absorption after a 10  ms time of flight . </S>",

    "<S> each horizontal line is the average of typically eight absorption images integrated along the @xmath51 direction . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) results of the simulation without any adjustable parameters . </S>",

    "<S> we measured in a separate experiment a mean velocity is @xmath53 and a r.m.s velocity spread @xmath54 corresponding to the shaded region of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . for each lattice depth @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> an average image is generated from eight individual runs and then integrated along the transverse direction @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) is a stack of 55 such profiles . </S>",
    "<S> for sake of comparison , figure  [ fig3](b ) is the result of a numerical simulation of the wavepacket dynamics using the one - dimensional schrdinger equation solved by the split - fourier method ; the initial condition is a gaussian wavepacket with the experimentally measured momentum and position dispersions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is no adjustable parameter and the overall agreement with experimental data means that our simple 1d model captures most of the physics involved .    let us concentrate first on the transmitted part of the wavepacket ( @xmath55 ) . if there were no lattice , the propagation time @xmath48 is long enough so that the initial size of the wavepacket is negligible with respect to its size after propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the wavepacket would then be a direct mapping of its initial velocity distribution @xmath56 : @xmath57 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](b ) compares then directly with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) whose horizontal axis is properly scaled . in the background of the shaded area of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) representing the wavepacket one can see the transmitted and reflected components . in the presence of the lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the reflected part propagates backwards and is located , for the propagation time chosen here , at a symmetrical position . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the transmitted and reflected wavepackets appear like complementary mirrored image of each other . </S>",
    "<S> the sawtooth - like boundary , reminiscent of the transmission diagram , is a fingerprint of the band structure inside the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of the lattice potential is not limited to the one of the sinusoidal component , responsible for the bragg reflection described above . </S>",
    "<S> the spatially averaged attractive potential also accelerates the wavepacket . the white dotted line on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) shows the final position of a classical particle starting with velocity @xmath0 from position @xmath40 and propagating for a time @xmath48 , taking into account its acceleration by the spatially averaged lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> the fair agreement with the data indicates that the slight curvature in the position of the wavepacket as a function of @xmath5 simply arises from this classical effect .     on the optical lattice for @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> the white dashed lines in panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the position of the center of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the time interval between successive images is 1  ms . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) : experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) : simulation , taking into account the finite imaging resolution as well as the time of flight ( tof ) period . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) : same as ( b ) but without tof nor reduced resolution ; the color scale is nonlinear in order to enhance contrast.,width=283 ]    beyond studying the asymptotic scattering states , it is also possible to visualise the dynamics of the interaction by varying @xmath48 . figure  [ fig4](a ) displays such a time sequence that fairly compares to the numerical simulation depicted in the same conditions in figure  [ fig4](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly observes the spreading of the incident wavepacket over the whole lattice for @xmath59 and its subsequent splitting into a reflected and a transmitted one . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the details of the inner dynamics are washed out by the free expansion of the wavepacket during the time - of - flight sequence and the finite resolution of the imaging system </S>",
    "<S> .    numerical simulations , properly checked against the previous experimental results , are useful here . in figure  [ fig4](c ) </S>",
    "<S> we have deliberately suppressed the time - of - flight period and enhanced the optical resolution and the contrast with respect to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) : one then clearly observes multiple reflections of some components of the wavepacket at symmetric positions @xmath26 , with decreasing amplitude at each bounce . </S>",
    "<S> this ` cavity - ring - down ' behavior explains the formation of structures in the transmitted and reflected wavepackets as observed in fig .  [ fig4](a ) and especially visible as a parallel lower stripe in the transmitted wavepacket for @xmath60 . however , experimentally , observing several bounces is not possible here due to the small number of atoms involved .     after a propagation time </S>",

    "<S> the lattice depth is @xmath61.,width=325 ]    in the same way , on images such as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] the reflected wavepacket appears to be relatively smooth . </S>",
    "<S> it is actually not the case as can be seen on simulations with full resolution ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice acts as a matterwave interference filter with very narrow features due to the high number of lattice sites ( foamy zones of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> until now we have used a simple one - dimensional description of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however the system is actually far from being one - dimensional , since the transverse quantum of energy @xmath62  hz is much smaller than the typical longitudinal energy scales , typically by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> our simple one - dimensional model agrees well with the experimental results as shown above because couplings between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom are weak ( they are due only to experimental imperfections such as misalignments of the lattice beams with respect to the guide for instance ) ; some transverse excitations can nevertheless be observed on our data ( see e.g. the long wavelength dipole oscillations on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) , especially for @xmath63  ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> stronger couplings would be expected to alter significantly the scattering properties of the structure  @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied in details the scattering of a guided matterwave by a finite length optical lattice in the slowly varying envelope limit . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments can be interpreted in the framework of a local band structure and the whole lattice can be seen as a bragg reflector / cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> major improvements are expected with the use of high numerical aperture optics  @xcite . reducing drastically the length @xmath64 of the lattice and thus generating a structure consisting of only a few sites , possibly with a shaped envelope </S>",
    "<S> , one could tailor almost arbitrarily the matterwave filter response . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if a controlled frequency offset between the two interfering beams is introduced , one generates a moving lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission band of the filter could then be adjusted at will . </S>",
    "<S> such setups would prove useful in measuring for instance the coherence length  @xcite of guided atom lasers  @xcite . in a different direction </S>",
    "<S> , it would be appealing to study the effect of interatomic interactions  @xcite on the propagation of the wavepacket , with the possible appearance of soliton trains  @xcite , or atom - blockade effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this regime could be reached by using much higher transverse frequencies for the guide , in order to enhance the effects of nonlinearities .    </S>",
