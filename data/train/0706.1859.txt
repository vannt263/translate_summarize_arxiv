    "the possibility of coherent manipulation of electron spins in low - dimensional nanostructures , aimed at future large - scale quantum information processing,@xcite calls for a thorough understanding of the spin interactions at play . in the proposal for quantum computing with quantum dots by loss and divincenzo ,",
    "the exchange coupling between the spins of electrons in tunnel - coupled quantum dots was envisioned as the controllable mechanism for coherent manipulation of spin qubits.@xcite recently , this fundamental building block of a possible future solid - state quantum computing architecture was realized in an experiment , demonstrating electrostatic control of the exchange coupling.@xcite    in this paper we present numerically exact finite - element methods for calculations of the exchange coupling between electron spins in tunnel - coupled quasi - one and two - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "such structures have already been under intensive theoretical investigation using various numerical methods , e.g.  based on an exact diagonalization of the underlying hamiltonian @xcite or using quantum - chemical approaches like self - consistent hartree ",
    "fock methods.@xcite such numerical approaches often require extensive numerical work .",
    "therefore , much attention has been devoted to simple approximations which lead to closed - form analytic expressions for the exchange coupling.@xcite it is , however , not immediately obvious to what extent these approximations yield correct predictions , and where they break down .",
    "for example , in a recent work@xcite the validity criterion for such approximations was the requirement that the exchange coupling at zero magnetic field always must be positive .",
    "a criterion like this can only provide a necessary condition for an approximate scheme to be acceptable .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a quantitative comparison of the heitler ",
    "london , the hund ",
    "mulliken , and the hubbard approximations , applied to a simple model potential of a double quantum dot , with numerically exact results .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case , where the distance between the two quantum dots is short , such that the single - dot electron wave functions have a large overlap . for short distances ,",
    "the exchange coupling can reach values on the order of several mev , making it sufficiently large to exploit and observe in experiments , and our comparative study is thus highly relevant for on - going experimental activities within the field .",
    "the finite - element methods used here allow an easy implementation using available numerical packages,@xcite also when finite magnetic fields are included , which strongly influence the exchange coupling in two - dimensional geometries .",
    "we find that the approximative schemes may provide reasonable predictions of the exchange coupling for certain parameter ranges , while they fail , also qualitatively , for short distances , even for the simple model potential considered here .",
    "their value in modeling more realistic quantum - dot structures used in experiments is thereby cast in serious doubt .",
    "experimentally , electrons can be confined in double quantum dots using metallic gates on top of a semiconductor heterostructure@xcite or across a nanowire@xcite or a nanotube.@xcite by suitable electrostatic gating such coulomb - blockade double quantum dots can be brought into a few - electron regime,@xcite where only a single electron occupies each of the two quantum dots . in this regime ,",

    "we use material parameters typical of gaas ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "we consider both the quasi - one dimensional limit @xmath16 and the two - dimensional case @xmath17 .",
    "the exchange coupling between the two electrons is a purely orbital effect which arises as a consequence of the pauli principle and the coulomb interaction which lead to a splitting @xmath18 of the lowest eigenvalue @xmath19 corresponding to a symmetric orbital wavefunction of the two electrons , @xmath20 , and the lowest eigenvalue @xmath21 corresponding to an anti - symmetric orbital wavefunction , @xmath22 . due to the pauli principle",
    "the orbital part of a singlet state must be symmetric , while the orbital part of a triplet state must be anti - symmetric .",
    "the splitting of the orbital wavefunctions may thereby be mapped onto an effective spin hamiltonian , @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite the task is to calculate the exchange coupling @xmath24 as function of various parameters , e.g. , the distance between the quantum dots and the applied magnetic field .",
    "a magnetic field only affects the exchange coupling significantly in two - dimensional geometries and we consequently concentrate on the inclusion of a magnetic field in the two - dimensional case @xmath17 .",
    "we first consider the quasi - one dimensional limit @xmath16 , which may be relevant , e.g. , for describing confined electrons in nanowires . in this limit",

    ", @xmath29 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the exchange coupling can now be calculated using finite - elements by mapping the one - dimensional two - particle problem onto an effective two - dimensional single - particle problem : we consider the two - particle wavefunction @xmath30 as describing a single fictitious particle with spatial coordinates @xmath31 and momentum @xmath32 .",
    "mathematically , the corresponding single - particle - like hamiltonian then reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the effective external potential that the fictitious particle experiences .    in this reformulation of the problem ,",
    "the symmetry of the original two - particle wavefunction enters via the boundary condition along the diagonal @xmath35 .",
    "symmetric wavefunctions fulfill @xmath36 and consequently @xmath37 ( neumann condition ) , while anti - symmetric wavefunctions fulfill @xmath38 and thus @xmath39 ( dirichlet condition ) . since @xmath40 is a confining potential , eigenfunctions go to zero in the limit @xmath41 . in the numerical calculations we assume that the eigenfunctions are zero outside a certain finite range , and we check that the results converge with respect to an increase of this range .",
    "thus , we only need to solve a one - particle problem on a finite - size two - dimensional domain with well - defined boundary conditions .",
