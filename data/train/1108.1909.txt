    ", the efimov effect remained elusive to observations for a long time . over the last forty years",
    ", experimental realizations of the efimov effect have been proposed for a number of different systems belonging to nuclear , molecular , and atomic physics , such as triton compounds , halo nuclei , trimers of @xmath0he atoms , and ultracold quantum gases .",
    "the variety of these systems represents very different energy regimes , ranging from mev in nuclear physics to pev for ultracold atomic systems .    after more than 35 years of intense searches",
    "an efimov trimer state was finally observed in summer 2005 in collisional studies on an ultracold gas of cesium atoms @xcite . since then , an increasing number of experiments with ultracold gases showed clear evidence of the efimov effect @xcite , confirming its general character and pointing towards related novel few - body phenomena @xcite .",

    "_ scattering length _",
    "@xmath1 the two - body scattering length is the essential quantity to characterize elastic collisions between particles at ultralow energies .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be solved by superposition of an incoming plane wave and of an outgoing scattered wave . in general the latter contains different partial wave contributions but at very low collisional energies @xmath2 , zero orbital angular momentum collisions are predominant ( @xmath3-wave collisions ) . at long distance the wavefunction of the system approaches its asymptotic form , while a fast oscillation is present in the range of the interaction potential .",
    "the phase shift @xmath4 between the incoming and outgoing wave at long distances contains the relevant information on the collision .",
    "the phase @xmath4 is generally a function of the momentum @xmath5 of the colliding particles but , in the limit of zero energy , it can be expanded in powers of @xmath6 and related to the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath7 through @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so - called _ effective range _ , which is determined from the long - range behavior of the potential . the term @xmath10 represents the next term in the expansion of the phase shift for @xmath11 . however , when the particle momentum is much smaller than @xmath12 , the effect of the interactions is indistinguishable from the one of a contact interaction @xcite .    in the case of atoms in the electronic ground state ,",
    "the long - range potential has a @xmath13 tail governed by van der waals interaction as depicted in fig.[feshbach ] .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is characteristic of the colliding atoms and its value can be numerically estimated from first principles @xcite . the natural length scale associated with the van der waals interaction",
    "is represented by the van der waals length @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the atom and @xmath17 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "this parameter determines a natural boundary between short- and long - range physics in atomic collisions .",
    "_ feshbach resonances _ @xmath1 the scattering length between two particles ( atoms , nucleons , molecules ) is fixed by the details of the interactions and can have both positive and negative values .",
    "the exceptional power of ultracold atomic gases is the tunability of @xmath7 through magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "when a molecular state in a different interatomic potential ( the _ closed channel _ ) has a different magnetic moment compared to the free atom pair ( the _ entrance channel _ ) , the relative energy can be tuned to zero ; see fig.[feshbach ] .",
    "if the bound state then couples to the atomic threshold ( e.g.  by exchange coupling , spin - dipole or high - order spin - orbit ) , a divergence of @xmath7 is induced .",
    "the resonant behavior results in a large tunability of the scattering length from plus to minus infinity and in the case of a single isolated resonance , the dependence of the scattering length @xmath7 on the applied magnetic field strength @xmath18 can be parametrized in a convenient way as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pole and the width of the resonance , respectively , and @xmath22 is the background scattering length of the entrance channel ( see fig.[feshbach ] ) .      the regime where the scattering length @xmath7 between two particles exceeds by far any other length scale of the two - body potential , @xmath23 , is known as _",
    "universal regime_. the physics of the two - body system is then determined only by @xmath7 and becomes independent on the details of the short - range potential . at large positive values of the scattering length ,",
    "a shallow two - body bound state is present below the atomic threshold .",
    "this state is universal and shows halo character as the wavefunction extends far into the forbidden region with only a small fraction of the probability density in the interaction region @xcite .",
    "the dimer size is of the order of @xmath7 and the binding energy @xmath24 is quadratic in @xmath25 .",
    "near the center of the feshbach resonance this corresponds to a quadratic dependence on the magnetic detuning @xmath26 , as clearly visible in the inset of fig.[feshbach](b ) .",
    "although eq.([fr ] ) holds for any isolated resonance , there is an important distinction between feshbach resonances , which is based on the fraction of the width @xmath21 over which universal behavior is present .",
    "this is commonly quantified by using the strength parameter @xmath27 , defined as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is defined as the mean scattering length of the van der waals interaction @xcite ( for cesium @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the difference in magnetic moment between the closed and entrance channel .",
    "large values ( @xmath32 ) characterize _ open - channel dominated _ resonances , where universal behavior is present for a large fraction of the resonance width . in this case , the scattering problem reduces to an effective single - channel problem with the spin character of the entrance - channel potential .",
    "small values ( @xmath33 ) define instead _ closed - channel dominated _ resonances .",
    "a useful quantity is the feshbach resonance parameter @xmath34 @xcite , which describes the length scale over which the feshbach coupling influences the effective range @xmath9 . on resonance ( @xmath35 )",

    "dimer binding energies the quadratic dependence on @xmath25 can be refined by introducing finite range corrections associated to @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 in the limiting case of @xmath40 , the energy relation for universal halo dimers is restored .",
    "the two possible terms of correction will be useful for the discussion on efimov physics in sec.[sec:8 ] .",
    "ultracold cesium gases feature unique scattering properties , which have made them a prime candidate to observe efimov physics .",
    "the atomic state of interest is the lowest internal state @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the quantum numbers for the hyperfine and magnetic state .",
    "atoms in this state are immune against two - body inelastic decay , as there are no energetically open decay channels .",
    "the scattering properties of ultracold cs have been subject to intense investigations for more than a decade .",
    "feshbach spectroscopy @xcite , which is based on detecting resonances and investigating the underlying near - threshold molecular structure , has been intensively pursued first at stanford university @xcite and then by our group in innsbruck @xcite .",
    "together with elaborate models for the near - threshold molecular structure @xcite a high level of understanding and accurate knowledge of the dependence of the scattering length on the magnetic field has been reached .",
    "two main factors make the cs scattering properties special and largely different from many other species .",
    "first , the open channel features an extremely large scattering length , associated with the existence of a weakly - bound halo state . the corresponding background scattering length @xmath44 exceeds the van der waals radius @xmath45 by more than a factor of 20 , which according to eq .",
    "( [ sreseq ] ) strongly supports the occurrence of resonances with a large strength parameter @xmath46 and thus with a large universal range",
    ". moreover , higher - order relativistic feshbach coupling effects are particularly strong for this heavy species , enhancing the coupling to molecular states with higher partial wave character .",
    "therefore , the feshbach resonance structure in cs is particularly rich and a zoo of extremely broad , intermediate and very narrow feshbach resonances is found .",
    "it is important to note that essentially all previous publications on efimov physics in cs published before 2011 relied on an @xmath47 conversion that was based on the early stanford experimental data and a theoretical model by nist researchers @xcite .",
    "this model is quite accurate for low magnetic fields up to about 100 g .",
    "later our group largely extended the magnetic field range of feshbach spectroscopy , and we performed additional measurements pinpointing zero crossings of the scattering length @xcite . in collaboration with theorists from nist ( p. s. julienne ) and the univ .  or durham ( j. m. hutson ) this has resulted in an extended and an improved @xmath47 conversion @xcite .",
    "we use the new @xmath47 conversion throughout this article . for features in the low - field region , this results in small deviations for the specified scattering lengths in comparison to the originally published values .        on a coarse - grain level the @xmath3-wave scattering properties",
    "are dominated by three broad @xmath3-wave feshbach resonances with poles near @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the three resonances are generated by three molecular potentials with different spin properties .",
    "the fact that they are open - channel dominated ( @xmath27 exceeding one hundred ) shows that they very well fulfill the conditions for universal behavior .",
    "let us in the following discuss the different magnetic field regions where efimov features have been observed in some more detail .",
    "the low magnetic field region ( region _ i _ in fig.[scatt ] ) has been subject of many investigations @xcite .",
    "the pole of the dominating feshbach resonance is at @xmath51 and the zero crossing has been determined with high accuracy to @xmath52 by bloch oscillation measurements @xcite .",
    "the accessible range of scattering length is approximately between @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and this large tunability has been the key point for the first observation of efimov features in 2006 @xcite .",
    "the region of magnetic field around @xmath57 ( region _ ii _ in fig.[scatt ] ) is characterized by a cluster of four @xmath58-wave resonances .",
    "the widest one , centered at @xmath59 has a width of @xmath60 and has an open - channel dominated character , while the remaining three resonances are closed - channel dominated .",
    "the feshbach scenario around @xmath61 ( region _ iii _ in fig.[scatt ] ) shows two overlapping resonances , a broad @xmath3-wave and a narrow @xmath62-wave resonance .",
    "the presence of the wide @xmath3-wave resonance induces a negative background scattering length ( @xmath63 ) for the narrow @xmath62-wave resonance .",
    "this relative large background scattering length and the strong second - order spin - orbit coupling make this resonance a rare example of a broad @xmath62-wave resonance . among the resonances presented here ,",
    "this is the only one that is not closed - channel dominated and it represents a peculiar case as it resides on the shoulder of an open - channel dominated one - wave resonances ( neither plotted nor included in coupled - channel calculations ) appear at the atomic threshold .",
    "the most relevant ones are at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . ] .    in the magnetic field region between @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( region _ iv _ in fig.[scatt ] ) the feshbach scenario features an extreme case of an open - channel dominated @xmath3-wave resonance with a width of @xmath70 .",
    "than any other known resonance in cs or any other system . ]",
    "the tunability of the scattering length is very large on both sides of the resonance and the universal regime extends over many gauss .",
    "an important additional feature is a broad @xmath58-wave resonance near 820 g , which occurs at a very large and negative background scattering length of about @xmath71 .",

    "a similar reduction was also observed in our cs experiments @xcite , as discussed in sec.[sec:6 ] .",
    "the rice group @xcite and the bar ilan group @xcite studied the efimov spectrum and the corresponding universal relations in ultracold gases of @xmath194li . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors reported a number of recombination features for both positive and negative @xmath7 values that they interpreted as being caused by consecutive tri - atomic and atom - dimer efimov resonances , and recombination minima .",
    "however the interpretation of the loss features in terms of the efimov scenario partially remains an open issue because of discrepancies in the @xmath47 conversion used by both groups @xcite and further investigations are need to unambiguously assign the observed features . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the bar ilan group performed recombination - rate measurements with atoms in two spin channels and compared their results .",
    "they observed a tri - atomic efimov resonance appearing for both spin states at the same value of the scattering length @xmath244 .",
    "in addition , they found the corresponding recombination minimum at a position @xmath245 , which is in an excellent agreement with universal theory . combining the bar ilan with our results",
    ", we can conclude that the efimov resonances are largely insensitive to the entrance spin channel @xcite and to the character of the closed channel underlying the feshbach resonance used to tune the interactions into the resonant regime @xcite .",
    "the efimov effect does not only occur in systems of three identical bosons as we have discussed so far , but can be generalized to the case of distinguishable particles . in ultracold gas experiments , a system of non - identical atoms can be realized using fermions or bosons in spin - state mixtures or heteronuclear mixtures of two or more atomic species .",
    "an intriguing case is provided by three - component spin mixture in ultracold fermi gases of @xmath210li atoms , where the atoms are equally distributed in the three lowest spin channels .",
    "a remarkable feature of this system is that each of the three relevant spin channels exhibits a broad @xmath3-wave feshbach resonance @xcite ; all three resonances overlap in a wide magnetic field range .",
    "this situation provides a very general realization of the efimov scenario where three non - identical particles resonantly interact with each other , with all three scattering lengths , corresponding to the three two - body sub - systems , being very large .",
    "three groups , one in heidelberg , one at penn state university , and one in tokyo have used this system to explore efimov physics @xcite .",
    "tri - atomic efimov resonances were observed in recombination - rate experiments @xcite and the binding energies of an efimov trimer state were measured as a function of the scattering length via radio - frequency spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the efimov problem of distinguishable particles can also be realized with heteronuclear mixtures .",
    "remarkably , the universal scaling factor strongly depends on the mass ratio and very dense spectra can appear for mass imbalanced systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , the scaling factor reduces from 22.7 to about 5 passing from a system of three identical bosons to the yb - yb - li system , which has a mass imbalance factor of about 28 .",
    "so far , efimov states in heteronuclear mixtures were observed only in @xmath246k-@xmath247rb mixtures by the florence group @xcite .",
    "they observed two tri - atomic efimov resonances , one connected to the k - rb - rb system and the other one to the k - k - rb combination , that showed very different collisional rate values and decay parameter @xmath105 , pointing to the difference in behavior between the light - heavy - heavy and the light - light - heavy three - body system .",
    "thanks to all these experiments on ultracold gases , the efimov scenario could be firmly established and important steps beyond the three - boson systems were made by investigating universal four - body physics",
    ". however , the experimental observations also raised questions on how far universal theories can be applied to describe real systems and to which extent non - universal and short - range physics affect efimov s original scenario .",
    "efimov s scenario is now well established as the paradigm of universal few - body physics .",
    "the experimental possibilities opened up by ultracold gases with tunable interactions have given an enormous boost to research on few - body phenomena .",
    "with the recent experiments , the basic phenomenology and many key elements of universal few - body physics could be confirmed , but there are still open issues awaiting for clarifications .",
    "the latter mainly concerns the question in how far real - world systems follow the idealized universal behavior or at which point nonuniversal physics takes over .    in a more general sense , an increasing number of few - body phenomena involving three or more resonantly interacting particles are being discovered in a great variety of different situations and environments ; see e.g.  @xcite . here ,",
    "the properties of the particles and their interactions are crucial for the particular nature of a few - body phenomenon . the composition of different masses , the quantum statistics , the interactions via @xmath3- and higher partial waves , possible dipolar interactions , and the external trapping environment offer a huge parameter space for a wealth of phenomena to occur .",
    "an intriguing general question is how few - body phenomena affect the many - body physics of a strongly interacting quantum system or , in other words , how one can better understand the properties of a many - body system based on few - body physics . on one hand",
    ", we have to understand loss and recombination properties in such a system , which in many cases impose limitations to the experiments . on the other hand",
    ", the few - body approach can give new insights into the many - body physics of a strongly interacting system .",
    "in the context of fermi gases , important examples are given by the stability of dimers @xcite , the few - body perspective on the bec - bcs crossover problem @xcite , and the virial expansion @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent theoretical work has shown that general connections exist between few - body interactions and the essential properties of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "many additional possibilities result from the control of the external degrees of freedom , offered in a unique way by ultracold gases in an optical trapping environment .",
    "optical lattices allow for tight confinement in one , two , or three dimensions allowing for the realization of low - dimensional systems with highly non - trivial properties .",
    "such lattices also mimic the period environment of a solid - state crystal .",
    "a new avenue of research is to exploit few - body interactions to introduce higher - order correlations into such systems @xcite , which in a controlled way can lead to many - body phases with novel properties .",
    "research along these lines is in an early stage , but may have strong implications for many - body physics in optical lattices .",
    "forty years after its prediction , efimov physics stands for a new research field with many intriguing opportunities .",
    "few - body phenomena are ubiquitous in strongly interacting particle systems , and learning more about the general nature and particular properties will enable us to better understand and control the physics of quantum matter under conditions of strong interactions .",
