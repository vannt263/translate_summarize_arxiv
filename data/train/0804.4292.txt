    "optical position meters can be thought of as constituent parts of laser interferometers such as michelson or mach - zehnder .",
    "for instance , long - baseline michelson interferometer is the composition of two round - trip position meters : two optical waves , emerging from and returning to approximately the same spacial point , inside interferometer arms carry the information about displacements of the end - mirrors . upon their arrival to photodetector the latter measures the relative phase of two waves proportional to the relative displacement of the end - mirrors .",
    "currently long - baseline optical interferometers , such as ligo @xcite , are the world most sensitive instruments for measuring the relative displacements between the test masses , which might be produced by the gravitational waves ( gws ) coming to the earth from astrophysical sources . traditionally in literature interaction of the gravitational waves with laser interferometers is considered in the framework of the so - called transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge @xcite .",
    "though the tt - based analysis of the gw detectors is usually exceptionally simple , it is sometimes hard to be justified physically since the major requirement of the tt gauge is the ideal inertiality of the test masses . in other words , in order to validate the tt - based analysis one must require that the test masses strictly follow the geodesics of the gw space - time , i.e. no non - gravitational forces are present .",
    "however , at least in the earth - bound experimental installations test masses undergo various non - geodesic motions due to noises in the environment ( such as seismic noise ) , in the test masses themselves ( thermal noise ) , due to measurement devices ( back - action noise ) and others .    in order to deal correctly with external forces when analyzing the operation of an interferometer ( or optical position meter ) one should perform the calculations in the proper reference frame of its detector since it is the device that produces an experimentally observable quantity .",
    "since detector is subjected to the action of fluctuative forces in general , its proper reference frame is non - inertial .",
    "this is particularly important for the certain class of the gw detectors called displacement - noise - free interferometers , which are mostly of mach - zehnder @xcite or fabry - perot @xcite type , where non - geodesic motion of detector(s ) may significantly affect the operation of an interferometer limiting its sensitivity to gws",
    ". the main goal of this paper is to develop the method of solving certain electrodynamical problems in such non - inertial reference frames .",
    "we start from the introduction of space - time metric in the vicinity of an accelerated observer .",
    "first , consider the laboratory ( globally inertial ) frame with minkowski metric @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "greek indices run over @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the non - relativistic ( @xmath3 ) coordinate transformation @xcite",
    "@xmath4.\\label{coord trans}\\ ] ] brings us from the laboratory frame to the proper reference frame of the observer ( reference body for definiteness ) moving with acceleration @xmath5 along the @xmath6-axis . throughout the paper prime denotes the physical quantity evaluated in the observer s proper reference frame .",
    "according to the transformation law , metric in the vicinity of an accelerated observer , accurate to linear order of @xmath7 , takes the form : @xmath8+dx'^2+dy'^2+dz'^2 .",
    "\\label{interval}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we assume that the acceleration @xmath5 is so small that for all @xmath7 and @xmath9 condition @xmath10 is fulfilled . in particular , for the ground - based interferometers one can estimate @xmath11 with @xmath12 hz ( the upper boundary of the operating frequency band ) , @xmath13 m ( typical values of the fluctuative displacements ) , @xmath14 m ( typical interferometer arm length ) , so that @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we will use the methods of linearized theory in full similarity with the theory of linear gravitational waves ; we will keep only the 0th and the 1st order in @xmath5 terms further .",
    "metric tensor corresponding to interval ( [ interval ] ) and the determinant of its matrix are : @xmath16      since we consider the motion of the test masses along the @xmath7-axis , the only christoffel symbols needed are @xmath17 with @xmath18 : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "geodesic equation for the @xmath6-axis reads : @xmath21 in the non - relativistic approximation @xmath22 and @xmath23 , therefore we obtain the following equation of motion ( for strict derivation see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath24 which coincides exactly with the newtonian law of motion in the non - inertial frame .",
    "if the test mass @xmath25 is also subjected to some external force @xmath26 as seen from the laboratory frame , then the latter should be added to the right side of the equation : @xmath27 thus , in the absence of the observer s acceleration ( when @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) we obtain the newtonian motion law of the test mass in the laboratory frame : @xmath30 .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the test mass and the observer stay in rest , separated by a distance @xmath31 , with respect to the laboratory frame in the absence of all forces in order not to consider the effects of uniform motion .",
    "below we will consider the problems where test masses undergo tiny fluctuative displacements under the influence of external forces , i.e. @xmath32 is of the same order of smallness as @xmath33 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq_of_mot ] ) allows significant simplification : according to the transformation law ( [ coord trans ] ) coordinate time in the observer s frame @xmath9 and the one in the laboratory frame @xmath34 differ in the amount proportional to @xmath35 which is the quantity of the 1st order of smallness .",
    "therefore , up to the 1st order @xmath36 and @xmath37 . under the listed assumptions",
    "( [ eq_of_mot ] ) can be integrated in the following form : @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{law_of_mot}\\ ] ] it will be convenient to separate the 0th order and the 1st order summands : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the result of double integration of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the result of double integration of @xmath45 .",
    "the physical meaning of these quantities is clear : @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the displacements of the test mass and the reference mass correspondingly with respect to the laboratory frame , while @xmath48 is the displacement of the test mass with respect to the reference mass ( i.e. with respect to the proper reference frame of the reference mass ) .",
    "in the interferometric experiments an observer studies the motion of the test masses by sending and receiving the reflected light waves . according to the equivalence principle an accelerated frame ( of the observer ) is equivalent to some gravitational field which is known to impose the distributed redshift on electromagnetic waves .",
    "thus it is necessary to calculate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the space - time of an accelerated observer in order to obtain a complete description of an interferometer .",
    "we will derive the wave equation from the second pair of maxwell s equations without the sources : @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the 4-potential of electromagnetic field . substituting the definition of @xmath52 into the field equations we obtain : @xmath53 let us impose lorentz or coulomb gauge ( this will influence only the procedure of quantization ) so that @xmath54 vanishes .",
    "remind now that the non - zero components of metric tensor ( [ metric ] ) are @xmath55 and @xmath56 and let us assume that the vector - potential describes the propagation along the @xmath7-axis of the plane electromagnetic wave polarized along the @xmath57-axis , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "remind also that @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , wave equation reduces to : @xmath61 substituting here the components of metric tensor in an explicit form and linearizing the equation with respect to the terms containing @xmath5 , we finally obtain the following scalar wave equation : @xmath62 here @xmath63 .",
    "the right side of this equation describes the redshift produced by the non - inertiality of the reference frame .",
    "it is convenient to solve the obtained equation using the method of successive approximations in full similarity with the solution of wave equation in ref @xcite .",
    "we shall keep only the 0th and the 1st order in @xmath5 terms : latexmath:[$a'(x',t')=a'^{(0)}(x',t')+a'^{(1)}(x',t ' ) , \\    corresponds to the unaccelerated observer which stays in rest in the laboratory frame .",
    "thus , solution of the 0th order can be represented as a sum of plane monochromatic waves traveling in positive and negative directions of the @xmath7-axis with amplitudes and frequency measured in the laboratory frame in the state of rest .",
    "we denote `` positive '' wave with index + and `` negative '' wave with index  : @xmath65 where @xmath66 . evidently , in the 0th order @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "amplitudes and frequency are derived from some initial and boundary problems and we shall keep them undefined until next section . the 1st order equation is : @xmath69 the general solution of this equation can be represented as a sum of `` positive '' and `` negative '' waves : @xmath70 clearly , they can be treated independently .",
    "remind , that @xmath71 and therefore , we must demand that @xmath72 physically these initial conditions mean that both the light waves @xmath73 experience no redshift at @xmath74 , i.e. the solution of full eq .",

    "several features of @xmath84 are worth noting .",
    "first , according to the physical sense @xmath85 , i.e. the frequency of electromagnetic wave is not redshifted in the immediate vicinity of an observer .",
    "second , for small enough @xmath86 ( in spectral domain this corresponds to @xmath87 limit ) @xmath84 has the @xmath88 $ ] asymptotic .",
    "this agrees with the relativity principle : electromagnetic wave senses only the acceleration of the reference frame , not the displacement @xmath47 or velocity @xmath89 .",
    "finally , since @xmath44 and @xmath90 are the pure real quantities , @xmath84 are the pure imaginary quantities and therefore describe the influence of the acceleration on the phase ( amplitude is affected beginning from the 2nd order ) : @xmath91e^{-i(\\omega_0t'\\mp k_0x')}\\nonumber\\\\      & \\approx a_{\\pm0}e^{-i(\\omega_0t'\\mp k_0x')+w'_\\pm(x',t')}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "it is useful to consider the physical reason underlying the discrepancy of results obtained in the laboratory frame and the proper frame of detector .",
    "consideration in the laboratory frame implies that all the clocks built in the test masses are synchronized with the laboratory clock . in turn , this requires the knowledge of the velocities of the test masses with respect to the laboratory frame . evidently , an observer , staying in rest in the laboratory , is able to measure the velocities of the test masses with respect to the latter .",
