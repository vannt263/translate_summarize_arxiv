    "spin glass models on random graphs have been extensively studied in statistical mechanics of random systems @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first reason comes from a motivation for describing thermodynamic phases of models with finite connectivity which might have a different nature from the infinite - range model .",
    "models on random graphs may form the simplest class for this motivation , while the final goal is to understand the nature of finite - dimensional models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from spin glass materials in nature , it has been found that spin glass models on random graphs frequently appear in combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "many constraint satisfaction problems can be mapped to problems concerning the ground states of spin glass models @xcite , and the solutions space for random instances is characterized by their complexity that is calculated by a theoretical technique developed in studies on spin glasses .",
    "this provides the second reason for intensive studies on spin glass models on random graphs .",
    "the first step of studying models is to determine transition points . as an example , let us consider @xmath0-body interaction spin glass models on random graphs @xcite .",
    "for the model with @xmath2 , a full replica symmetry breaking ( frsb ) occurs at a transition temperature whose value is determined by the condition that the replica symmetric ( rs ) solution becomes unstable . when @xmath3 , a one - step rsb ( 1rsb ) occurs , but the transition is not detected by simply searching the instability point of the rs solution because of the discontinuous nature of the transition .",
    "in order to determine the transition temperature , we need another method different from analyzing the free energy under the rs ansatz .",
    "up to the present , the 1rsb transition temperature of models on random graphs has often been studied by using the replica method with the 1rsb ansatz @xcite , a variational approximation of the replica method @xcite , the 1rsb cavity method extending the bethe - peierls approximation to the 1rsb phase @xcite , and the replica method with finite replica number and the rs ansatz @xcite . in particular , in the 1rsb cavity method , which might be the most standard method for the calculation of the 1rsb transition temperature , one needs to solve self - consistent equations for functionals of the probability distributions of cavity fields in general .",
    "these self - consistent equations can be solved numerically by using the algorithm called population dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that the 1rsb transition is characterized by the divergence of point - to - set correlation length within the 1rsb cavity method @xcite . in the replica method for models on random graphs ,",
    "the free energy is calculated by using the function order parameter .",
    "the method using finite replica number @xcite assumes a property of the cumulant generating function of the free energy , which turns out to be equivalent to the replica method with the factorized ansatz @xcite .    as a different approach to determine the 1rsb transition temperature , the method using the franz - parisi potential @xcite has been proposed .",
    "the franz - parisi potential is an effective potential of overlap between two replicas and we can detect the transition by investigating a qualitative change of the potential",
    ". an explicit form of the franz - parisi potential has been derived theoretically for the infinite - range spin glass models .",
    "the advantage of the method using the franz - parisi potential is that we can calculate the transition temperature under only the rs ansatz .",
    "in fact , in the infinite - range model , the transition temperature calculated by using this potential with the rs ansatz agrees with the result by the standard 1rsb ansatz .",
    "if this method can apply to models on random graphs , we can determine the transition temperature with easier calculation than the 1rsb methods . for models on random graphs , since the computational cost for the methods with the rs ansatz is significantly lower than that for the methods with the 1rsb ansatz , it is a major advantage if applicable .",
    "however , the franz - parisi potential has not been employed for calculating the transition temperature of models on random graphs , because the 1rsb phase is characterized by a nontrivial distribution of cavity fields .",
    "it should be noted that a computational method of the franz - parisi potential of diluted disordered models on random graphs was proposed by generalizing the cavity method @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the transition temperature of models on regular random graphs by analyzing the franz - parisi potential under the rs ansatz . by comparing our results with those obtained by the 1rsb methods ,",
    "we conclude that our method is useful for obtaining a good approximation of the transition temperature with considerably lower computational cost .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] , we present the models we study , define the franz - parisi potential and its legendre transform , and explicitly express a condition that determines the transition point .",
    "we also express this legendre transform by using the rs cavity method . in section [ sec : results ] , we make an assumption in order to solve the problem in terms of a few self - consistent equations , and as a result , we obtain the transition temperature . in section [ sec : relation ] , we remark difference between our method and the standard 1rsb methods . finally , in section [ sec : concluding remarks ] , we discuss the validity of the assumption we made . in appendicies , we review the analysis on the infinite - range model for reference of our method and collect details of our calculation .",

    "we consider an effective potential of overlap between two replicas , the franz - parisi potential @xcite .",
    "the franz - parisi potential was originally introduced for the infinite - range model in order to detect the appearance of metastable states as a local minimum of the potential . in this calculation , the 1rsb transition point is determined as the temperature at which a nontrivial local minimum value of the potential is equal to the trivial local minimum value . in other words , at the transition temperature , the overlap between two replicas takes a nontrivial value in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "our results provide approximations .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that we obtain the transition temperature @xmath37 close to those obtained by the 1rsb methods .",
    "this fact suggests that the two - body cavity fields play an important role in describing rsb even in the models on random graphs .",
    "second , we conjecture that it would be difficult to extend our method to models on inhomogeneous graphs such as erds - rnyi graphs , because the assumption of homogeneous solution ( [ eq:2sol_p ] ) and ( [ eq:2sol_ph ] ) may not be effective in this case .",
    "we need to develop another method so as to analyze models on inhomogeneous graphs .",
    "we finally remark whether our method using the franz - parisi potential with the two - body cavity field approximation can be applied to other models on regular random graphs .",
    "we conjecture that our method is useful for models whose fully - connected limit can be described only by the two - body cavity fields .",
