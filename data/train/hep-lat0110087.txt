    "in recent lattice calculations , there have been several indications that the presence of sea quark increases the @xmath0 meson decay constant @xmath4 significantly , _ i.e. _ by about 1015% @xcite .",
    "then , the study of the sea quark effect on the @xmath0 parameters has a great phenomenological importance , because the relevant physical quantity to the @xmath5 mixing is the combination @xmath6 .    in this work",
    "we perform unquenched lattice calculations of both @xmath4 and @xmath7 using a consistent formulation .",
    "we use the nonperturbatively @xmath1-improved wilson quark action for both sea and valence light quarks , and the nrqcd action for heavy quark . using the same dynamical qcd configurations , a search for sea quark effects in the light hadron spectrum",
    "is also being performed @xcite .",
    "quenched calculations of @xmath4 and @xmath7 using the nrqcd action have been presented previously @xcite .    in full qcd , the effect of virtual pion loops leads to chiral logarithms , a specific dependence of physical quantities on the sea quark mass .",
    "hence , it provides a non - trivial test of the sea quark effect in lattice simulations . for @xmath4 and @xmath7 chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )",
    "is extensively studied in @xcite including its extension to the quenched and the partially quenched cases , where sea and valence quark masses can be different .",
    "we test the chiral logarithm using our numerical data .",
    "we generate a set of unquenched gauge configurations with the plaquette gauge action and two - flavors of nonperturbatively @xmath1-improved wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "simulations are performed on a @xmath3 lattice at @xmath8=5.2 , which roughly corresponds to the lattice spacing @xmath9 0.1  fm .",
    "we take five different sea quark masses covering @xmath10=0.60.8 . for comparison",
    "we also perform a quenched simulation at @xmath8=6.0 on the same lattice size .",
    "further details of our simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "we use the nrqcd action for heavy quark including all @xmath11 corrections consistently in the action and operators . in the calculations of @xmath4 and @xmath7",
    "we follow the methods adopted in the previous works @xcite . in particular , the @xmath0 parameters are computed with four different prescriptions , all of which have equivalent accuracy up to higher order contributions we neglect .",
    "we may estimate the systematic uncertainty taking the differences among them @xcite .",
    ".,width=283 ]    figure  [ fig : chi_phi_fb ] shows the chiral behavior of the heavy - light decay constant @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "both horizontal and vertical axes are normalized with a proper power of @xmath14 and converted to the physical unit using the lattice result for @xmath15 combined with physical input for @xmath16 . if we compare the unquenched result ( filled triangles ) with the quenched data ( open diamonds ) , we clearly find the increase of about 15% with the unquenching as found previously @xcite    we consider the following three forms for the chiral extrapolation @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the `` log '' form is motivated by the chpt result for heavy - light mesons @xcite . for two - flavor qcd , it predicts @xmath19 with @xmath20 the pion decay constant .",
    "the coupling @xmath21 describes @xmath22 interaction , which may be evaluated from @xmath23 decays using heavy quark symmetry .",
    "if we take a range @xmath21=0.20.7 rather conservatively covering @xmath24 decay @xcite and the recent @xmath23 width experiment @xcite , then we obtain @xmath25=@xmath260.5(2 )  gev@xmath27 .",
    "we find that both `` qua '' and `` log '' fits describe our unquenched data well , while the linear fit gives somewhat poorer @xmath28 than the other two .",
    "for the `` log '' fit we obtain @xmath25=@xmath260.4(3 )  gev@xmath27 , which is consistent with the above phenomenological estimate .    on the other hand , in quenched qcd ,",
    "no deviation from linearity is observed in our data , and the three fit forms lead to almost identical result in the chiral limit .",
    "this behavior contradicts the prediction of quenched chpt ( qchpt ) @xcite , which gives even stronger logarithmic dependence .",
    "there are , however , many unknown parameters in qchpt , so it is still possible to find a parameter region which mimics the linear behavior in our light quark mass regime .",
    "dependence of @xmath29.,width=283 ]    [ fig : mas_phi_fb ]    since we are not able to decide the fit form with our current unquenched data , the uncertainty in the chiral limit is quite large .",
    "figure  [ fig : mas_phi_fb ] shows the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath29 at the physical light quark mass . at the physical @xmath0 meson mass ,",
    "we observe that the two - flavor result ( filled symbols ) is 1425% larger than the quenched result ( open circle ) , depending on the fit form .",
    "we also examine the chiral behavior of @xmath7 by applying the fit forms in ( [ eq : chi_phi_r ] ) , but , because the light quark mass dependence itself is quite small , we do not observe any significant dependence on the fit functions . a weak dependence on sea quark mass is also suggested by chpt , which gives @xmath31 for @xmath7 .",
    "dependence of @xmath32.,height=283 ]    figure  [ fig : mas_bb ] shows the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath33 for both quenched ( open symbols ) and unquenched qcd ( filled symbols ) .",
    "four different symbols correspond to different prescriptions defined in @xcite . within the uncertainty indicated by the different prescriptions",
    ", we find no significant effect of unquenching .",
    "@xmath34 is also analyzed in a similar manner and we arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "our preliminary results in two - flavor qcd are summarized as follows , @xmath35 where errors are from statistics , chiral extrapolation , and systematics .",
    "we discard the linear fit from the final results because of its poor @xmath28 value .",
    "the central value is obtained by taking an average over `` qua '' and `` log '' results , and their difference is taken as a systematic error from the chiral extrapolation .",
    "some of the systematic errors in the @xmath0 parameters are estimated by the scatter with different prescriptions as in @xcite .",
    "other uncertainties are estimated by a naive dimensional counting , assuming @xmath36=500  mev and @xmath37=@xmath38=0.267 .",
    "our data for @xmath4 and @xmath7 are consistent with the prediction of chpt .",
    "this is different from the light hadron sector where we find that chpt fails to reproduce the lattice data for pion mass and decay constant @xcite . to investigate these issues we are currently accumulating further statistics , which also helps to reduce the statistical error in our results .",
