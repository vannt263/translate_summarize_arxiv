    "the standard model ( sm ) has proved to be very successful in describing the fundamental properties of elementary particles and their interactions , but it has to be extended in the flavor sector by covering the fact that the three known neutrinos are not massless and different lepton flavors can mix @xcite . in this case even a minimal extension of the sm involves twenty ( or twenty - two ) flavor parameters , among which twelve are masses , six are flavor mixing angles and two ( or four ) are cp - violating phases if the massive neutrinos are of the dirac ( or majorana ) nature .",
    "lepton flavor mixing matrix to be unitary , regardless of the origin of tiny neutrino masses . here",
    "the effective strong cp - violating parameter @xmath6 is not taken into account , but it will be briefly discussed in section iv . ] determining the values of these parameters and understanding why they are what they are constitute a central part of today s particle physics",
    ". however , we have to confront some flavor puzzles revealed by current experimental data .",
    "the flavor puzzles include why up - type quarks , down - type quarks and charged leptons all have strong mass hierarchies ( i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) at a given energy scale ; why the masses of three neutrinos are extremely small in comparison with those of nine charged fermions ; why the six off - diagonal elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark flavor mixing matrix @xmath10 @xcite are strongly suppressed such that the three mixing angles are very small ; why the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath11 @xcite contains two relatively large mixing angles and the third one is not strongly suppressed either ; why the patterns of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are so different but their smallest matrix elements are both located at the upper - right corner ( i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) @xcite ; how the origin of cp violation is correlated with the origin of fermion masses ; and so on . in the lack of a complete flavor theory capable of predicting the flavor structures of leptons and quarks or revealing possible symmetries behind them , it is a big challenge to answer even a part of the aforecited questions .",
    "the great ideas like grand unifications , supersymmetries and extra dimensions are still not very helpful to solve the flavor puzzles , and the exercises of various group languages or flavor symmetries turn out to be too divergent to converge to something unique @xcite .    in this paper we shall follow a purely phenomenological way to speculate whether the observed pattern of quark flavor mixing can be partly understood in some reasonable limits of quark masses .",
    "this starting point of view is more or less motivated by two useful working symmetries in understanding the strong interactions of quarks and hadrons by means of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) or an effective field theory based on the qcd @xcite : the chiral quark symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) and the heavy quark symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the reason for the usefulness of these two symmetries is simply that the masses of the light quarks are far below the typical qcd scale @xmath16 gev , whereas the masses of the heavy quarks are far above it . because the elements of the ckm matrix @xmath10 are dimensionless and their magnitudes lie in the range of 0 to 1 , they are in general expected to depend on the mass ratios of the lighter quarks to the heavier quarks .",
    "the mass limits corresponding to the chiral and heavy quark symmetries are therefore equivalent to setting the relevant mass ratios to zero , and they are possible to help reveal a part of the salient features of @xmath10 . in this spirit , some preliminary attempts have been made to look at the quark flavor mixing pattern in the @xmath17 or @xmath18 limits @xcite .",
    "the present work aims to show that it is actually possible to gain an insight into the observed pattern of quark flavor mixing in the chiral and heavy quark mass limits .",
    "such a model - independent access to the underlying quark flavor structure can at least explain why @xmath0 and @xmath19 should be smaller than @xmath20 . in particular , the phenomenologically successful relations @xmath21 and @xmath3 can be reasonably conjectured in the heavy quark mass limits .",
    "we also point out that the strength of cp violation in the quark sector is simply determined by the product of the four corner elements of @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , based on the experimental fact that two of the ckm unitarity triangles are almost the right triangles .",
    "this interesting observation motivates us to pay more attention to a particular parametrization of @xmath10 @xcite , in which the three flavor mixing angles are all comparable with the cabibbo angle and the tiny cp - violating phase only show up in the four corners of @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we make a brief comment on the effect of strong cp violation and then compare its strength with that of weak cp violation .",
    "we begin with the weak charged - current interactions of six quarks in their mass basis : @xmath26 where the ckm matrix @xmath10 measures a nontrivial mismatch between the flavor and mass eigenstates and can be decomposed into @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the unitary transformations responsible for the diagonalizations of the up- and down - type quark mass matrices in the flavor basis .",
    "namely , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined to be hermitian . to be explicit",
    ", the nine elements of @xmath10 read @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 run over @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . because of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the dimensionless @xmath38 elements are expected to be more or less dependent on the quark mass ratios and nontrivial phase differences between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . given current experimental data and the unitarity of @xmath10 ,",
    "the magnitudes of all the nine ckm matrix elements have been determined to an impressively good degree of accuracy @xcite : @xmath41 we shall show that the strong mass hierarchies of up- and down - type quarks allow us to account for a part of the observed flavor mixing properties in a model - independent way .      in general , the mass limit @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) does not correspond to a unique form of @xmath31 ( or @xmath44 ) .",
    "the reason is simply that the form of a quark mass matrix is always basis - dependent . without loss of generality , one may choose a particular flavor basis such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be written as @xmath45 in which  @xmath46 \" denotes an arbitrary nonzero element . to prove that eq .",
    "( 5 ) is the result of a basis choice instead of an assumption , we refer the reader to appendix a.    when the mass of a given quark goes to infinity , we argue that it becomes decoupled from the masses of other quarks .",
    "in this sense we may choose a specific flavor basis where @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be written as @xmath47 in other words , the @xmath48 hermitian matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be simplified to the effective @xmath49 hermitian matrices in either the chiral quark mass limit or the heavy quark mass limit . in view of the fact that @xmath50 and @xmath8 hold at an arbitrary energy scale @xcite , we believe that eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are phenomenologically reasonable and can help explain some of the observed properties of quark flavor mixing in a model - independent way .",
    "let us go into details in the following .      a glance at eq .",
    "( 4 ) tells us that @xmath0 is an excellent approximation .",
    "such an approximate equality can be well understood in the heavy quark mass limits , where hermitian @xmath31 and @xmath32 may take the form of eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in this case",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath28 and @xmath52 used to diagonalize @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "so eq . ( 7 )",
    "yields @xmath57 in the @xmath5 and @xmath58 limits , where @xmath59 denotes the nontrivial phase difference between the up- and down - quark sectors . since @xmath60 and @xmath61 hold @xcite , where @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the cabibbo angle , the mass limits taken above are apparently a good approximation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the approximate equality @xmath0 is attributed to the fact that @xmath64 and @xmath65 hold . holds .",
    "hence @xmath66 and @xmath67 are often conjectured and can easily be derived from some ans@xmath68tze of quark mass matrices @xcite .",
    "] one may similarly consider the chiral quark mass limits @xmath69 and @xmath43 in order to understand why @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "we are therefore left with @xmath74 in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 limits , where @xmath75 stands for the nontrivial phase difference between the up- and down - quark sectors .",
    "this model - independent result is also in good agreement with the experimental data @xmath1 as given in eq .",
    "in other words , the approximate equality @xmath51 is a natural consequence of @xmath76 and @xmath77 in no need of any specific assumptions . through @xmath78 and @xmath79 from a number of ans@xmath68tze of quark mass matrices @xcite . ]      given the magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "these numbers imply latexmath:[$|v^{}_{cd}/v^{}_{td}| \\simeq    good approximation , which has not come into notice in the literature .",
    "we find that such an approximate relation becomes exact in the mass limits @xmath42 and @xmath58 .",
    "to be explicit , @xmath85 where eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) have been used .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 holds in the chosen quark mass limits , which assure the smallest ckm matrix element @xmath12 to vanish .",
    "this simple result is essentially consistent with the experimental data if @xmath87 is taken .",
    ", which can easily be derived from the fritzsch ansatz of quark mass matrices @xcite . ]",
    "note that the quark mass limits @xmath5 and @xmath88 are less favored because they predict both @xmath89 and @xmath90 is apparently closer to reality than the limit @xmath89 .",
    "but why @xmath12 is smaller in magnitude than all the other ckm matrix elements remains a puzzle , since it is difficult for us to judge that the quark mass limits @xmath91 and @xmath92 should make more sense than the quark mass limits @xmath93 and @xmath43 from a phenomenological point of view . the experimental data in eq .",
    "( 4 ) indicate @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so a comparison between the ratios @xmath96 and @xmath20 might be able to tell us an acceptable reason for @xmath97 .      with the help of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we can calculate the ratios @xmath96 and @xmath20 in the respective heavy quark mass limits : @xmath98 this result is quite nontrivial in the sense that @xmath96 turns out to be independent of the mass ratios of three down - type quarks in the @xmath58 limit , and @xmath20 has nothing to do with the mass ratios of three up - type quarks in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "in particular , the flavor indices showing up on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) is rather suggestive : @xmath96 is relevant to @xmath99 and @xmath100 quarks , and @xmath20 depends on @xmath101 and @xmath102 quarks .",
    "we are therefore encouraged to conjecture that @xmath96 ( or @xmath20 ) should be a simple function of the mass ratio @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) in the @xmath5 ( or @xmath58 ) limit .    given the renormalized quark mass values @xmath105 mev , @xmath106 mev , @xmath107 mev and @xmath108 gev at the energy scale @xmath109 @xcite , the simplest phenomenological conjectures turn out to be @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the @xmath113 coefficients .",
    "in view of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we expect that @xmath96 is naturally smaller than @xmath20 in the heavy quark mass limits .",
    "taking @xmath116 and @xmath117 for example , we obtain @xmath118 and @xmath119 from eq .",
    "( 14 ) , consistent with the experimental results @xmath120 and @xmath121 as given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xcite .",
    "because @xmath122 gev and @xmath123 gev at @xmath109 @xcite , one may argue that @xmath5 is a much better limit and thus the relation @xmath124 has a good chance to be true . in comparison , @xmath125 suffers from much bigger uncertainties associated with the values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and even its coefficient ",
    "@xmath128 \" is questionable .",
    "it is well known that the fritzsch ansatz of quark mass matrices @xcite predicts @xmath129",
    ". a straightforward extension of the fritzsch texture @xcite , @xmath130 with @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) , can also lead us to @xmath129 .",
    "however , it is always possible to get @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 , @xmath128 , @xmath136 ) together with @xmath137 if the matrix elements @xmath138 and @xmath139 have a quite weak hierarchy in magnitude @xcite .",
    "this observation is interesting , as it implies that the phenomenological conjectures made in eq .",
    "( 14 ) can be a good starting point of view for model building in order to understand a possible correlation between the quark mass spectrum and the flavor mixing structure .",
    "a rephasing - invariant description of cp violation in the quark sector is the jarlskog parameter @xmath140 defined through @xcite : @xmath141 in which the greek and latin subscripts run over @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",

    "( 4 ) and ( 19 ) , we directly arrive at @xmath166 , which is perfectly consistent with the result @xmath167 obtained by the particle data group @xcite .    given weak cp violation in the quark sector as a corner effect of the ckm matrix @xmath10 , we have a good reason to consider the following parametrization of @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and so on .",

    "( 20 ) with eq .",

    "so far we have only paid attention to weak cp violation based on the ckm matrix in the sm . here",
    "let us make a brief comment on the strong cp problem , because it is closely related to the quark masses and may naturally disappear if one of the six quark masses vanishes .",
    "it is well known that there exists a p- and t - violating term @xmath194 , which comes from the instanton solution to the @xmath195 problem @xcite , in the lagrangian of qcd for strong interactions of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "this cp - violating term can be compared with the mass term of six quarks , @xmath196 , as follows : @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a free dimensionless parameter characterizing the presence of cp violation , @xmath199 is the strong fine - structure constant , @xmath200 ( for @xmath201 ) denote the @xmath202 gauge fields , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 is the overall @xmath205 quark mass matrix .",
    "the chiral transformation of the quark fields @xmath206 ( for @xmath207 ) leads to the changes @xmath208 in which the change of @xmath198 follows from the chiral anomaly @xcite in the chiral currents @xmath209 then the effective cp - violating term in qcd , which is invariant under the above chiral transformation , turns out to be @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a sum of the qcd and electroweak contributions @xcite .",
    "the latter depends on the phase structure of the quark mass matrix @xmath212 .",
    "because of @xmath213 the determinant of @xmath204 becomes vanishing in the @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) limit . in this case",
    "the phase of @xmath214 is arbitrary , and thus it can be arranged to cancel out @xmath198 such that @xmath215 .",
    "namely , qcd would be a cp - conserving theory if one of the six quarks were massless .",
    "but current experimental data have definitely ruled out the possibility of @xmath216 or @xmath217 .",
    "moreover , the experimental upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment yields @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "the strong cp problem is therefore a theoretical problem of how to explain why @xmath6 is nonzero but so small @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the weak and strong cp - violating effects might make sense , but it is difficult to choose a proper measure for either of them .",
    "the issue involves the reference energy scale and flavor parameters which may directly or indirectly determine the strength of cp violation . to illustrate",
    ", we consider the following preliminary measures of weak and strong cp - violating effects in the sm : , @xmath219 and @xmath220 down to the qcd scale might not make sense @xcite .",
    "one may only consider the masses of up and down quarks @xcite and then propose @xmath221 as an alternative measure of strong cp violation .",
    "] @xmath222 where @xmath223 gev , @xmath224 gev , and the sine function of @xmath6 has been adopted to take account of the periodicity in its values .",
    "so the effect of weak cp violation would vanish if the masses of any two quarks in the same ( up or down ) sector were equal , must vanish , leading to @xmath225 too @xcite . ] and the effect of strong cp violation would vanish if @xmath42 or @xmath226 held .",
    "the significant suppression of cp violation in the sm implies that an interpretation of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe @xcite requires a new source of cp violation beyond the sm , such as leptonic cp violation in the decays of heavy majorana neutrino based on the seesaw and leptogenesis mechanisms @xcite in neutrino physics .",
    "we have pointed out that it is possible to partly understand the observed pattern of quark flavor mixing in the chiral and heavy quark mass limits .",
    "such a model - independent access to the underlying quark flavor structure can help us explain latexmath:[$|v^{}_{us}| \\simeq       phenomenologically successful relations @xmath21 and @xmath3 can be reasonably conjectured in the heavy quark mass limits . in view of the experimental fact",
    "that two of the ckm unitarity triangles are almost the right triangles with @xmath228 , we have obtained latexmath:[${\\cal j}^{}_{\\rm q } \\simeq    particular parametrization of @xmath10 with the minimal cp - violating phase has been emphasized , and the rge running behaviors of its parameters have been discussed .",
    "we have also made a very brief comment on the strong cp problem , and compared between the preliminary measures of strong and weak cp - violating effects in the quark sector within the sm .",
    "although our present attempts in this regard remain quite limited , we do have obtained some encouraging results .",
    "we hope that the underlying flavor theory , which might be related to a certain flavor symmetry and its spontaneous or explicit breaking mechanism , could provide us with a more convincing dynamical reason for what we have observed about the structure of quark flavor mixing and cp violation .",
    "one may naturally ask whether the leptonic flavor mixing structure could similarly be understood in the reasonable mass limits of the charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "while the charged leptons have a strong mass hierarchy , the neutrino mass spectrum remains unknown to us  we do not know whether the three neutrinos have a normal mass hierarchy @xmath230 or an inverted mass hierarchy @xmath231 . on the other hand ,",
