    "modern x - ray observations show complex structures in both the spatial and spectral domains of various astrophysical sources . nonetheless , active galalactic nuclei ( agn ) including quasars nuclei remain spatially unresolved even with the highest - resolution x - ray telescopes .",
    "most of their energy is released within the unresolved core , and only spectral and timing information is available to study the nature of the x - ray emission .",
    "generally speaking , emission and absorption lines constitute an important part of the x - ray spectrum in that they can provide information as to the state of plasma .",
    "one of the goals of x - ray data analysis is to understand the components present in the spectrum , and to obtain information about the emission and absorption features , as well as their locations and relation to the primary quasar emission .",
    "the detection of weak lines in noisy spectra is the main statistical problem in such analyses : is a bump observed in the spectrum related to a real emission line or is it simply an artifact of the poissonian noise ?",
    "although quasars x - ray spectra are usually featureless as expected based on the comptonization process ( see for example * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an important x - ray emission feature identified in agn and quasars spectra is the iron k emission line ( see recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "determining the origin and the nature of this line is one of main issues in agn and quasar research .",
    "this line is thought to come directly from illuminated accretion flow as a fluorescent process @xcite .",
    "the location of the line in the spectrum indicates the ionization state of iron in the emitting plasma , while the width of the line tells us the velocity of the plasma @xcite .",
    "the iron line provides a direct probe of the innermost regions of accretion flow and matter in close vicinity of a black hole .",
    "absorption features associated with the outflowing matter ( warm wind , partial covering absorber ) have also been observed in recent x - ray observations @xcite . although the location and width of absorption lines provide information as to the velocity of the absorber and its distance from the quasar , this article focuses on statistical issues in fitting the spectral location of narrow emission lines , i.e. , identifying the ionization state .",
    "there are two parts to the fe - k - alpha emission line observed in agn @xcite : one is a broad component thought to be a signature of a relativistic motion in the innermost regions of an accretion flow ; the other is a narrow component that is a result of a reflection off the material at larger distances from the central black hole .",
    "a detection of the broad component is challenging as it requires a spectral coverage over a large energy range , so the continuum emission is well determined and the broad line can be separated @xcite .",
    "the relativistic line profile is broad and skewed , and two strong peaks of the emission line that originates in a relativistic disk can be prominent and narrow . while the full profile of the broad line may not be easily separable from the continuum , these two peaks may provide a signature for this line in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the broad fe - line gives an important diagnostic of the gas motion and can be used to determine the spin of a black hole @xcite ; see also an alternative model for the  red wing \" component by @xcite .",
    "the narrow component of the line gives diagnostics of the matter outside the accretion disk and conditions at larger distances from the black hole ; see fe - line baldwin effect discussion in @xcite .",
    "both line components are variable and the line may `` disappear '' from the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution of x - ray ccd detectors ( for example 100 - 200  ev in acis on _ chandra _ or epic on xmm-_newton _ ) is relatively low with respect to the predicted width of narrow ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ) emission or absorption lines in agn and quasars .",
    "observations with grating instruments ( rgs or heg ) can provide high resolution x - ray spectra , but the effective area of the present x - ray telescopes is too low for efficient agn detections , and only a handful of bright low redshift sources have been observed with gratings to date @xcite",
    ". therefore mainly the x - ray ccd spectra of lower resolution are used to study large samples of agn and quasars ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using these relatively low resolution x - ray detectors",
    ", the fe - k - alpha emission line can be narrow enough to be contained entirely in a single detector bin . in some cases ( for example in _",
    "chandra _ ) the line may occupy a few bins . in this article",
    "we focus on the statistical problem of fitting the spectral location of an emission line or a set of emission lines that are narrow .",
    "this is a common objective in high - energy analyses , but as we shall discuss fitting these relatively narrow features poses significant statistical challenges .",
    "in particular we find evidence that using line profiles that are narrower than we actually expect the emission line to be can improve the statistical properties of the fitted emission line location .",
    "x - ray spectra , such as those available with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ carry much information as to the quasar s physics . taking advantage of the spectral capacity of such instruments , however , requires careful statistical analysis .",
    "for example , the resolution of such instruments corresponds to a fine discretization of the energy spectrum . as a result",
    ", we expect a low number of counts in each bin of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "such low - count data make the gaussian assumptions that are inherent in traditional minimum @xmath2 fitting inappropriate .",
    "a better strategy , which we employ , explicitly models photon arrivals as an inhomogeneous poisson process @xcite . in addition",
    ", data are subject to a number of processes that significantly degrade the source counts , e.g. , the absorption , non - constant effective area , blurring of photons energy , background contamination , and photon pile - up .",
    "thus , we employ statistical models that directly account for these aspects of data collection .",
    "in particular , we design a highly structured multilevel spectral model with components for both the data collection processes and the complex spectral structures of the sources themselves . in this highly structured spectral model",
    ", a bayesian perspective renders straightforward methods that can handle the complexity of _ chandra _ data @xcite .",
    "as we shall illustrate , these methods allow us to use low - count data , to search for the location of a narrow spectral line , to investigate its location s uncertainty , and to construct statistical tests that measure the evidence in the data for including the spectral line in the source model .",
    "the energy spectrum can be separated into two basic parts : a set of continuum terms and a set of several emission lines .",
    "we begin with a standard spectral model that accounts for a single continuum term along with several spectral lines . throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath3 as a general representation of model parameters in the spectral model .",
    "the components of @xmath4 represent the collection of parameters for the continuum , ( emission ) lines , absorption , and background contamination , respectively .",
    "( notice that the roman letters in the superscripts serve as a mnemonic for these four processes . ) because the x - ray emission is measured by counting the arriving photons , we model the expected poisson counts in energy bin @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the set of energy bins , as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the width and mean energy of bin @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the expected counts per unit energy due to the continuum term at energy @xmath9 , @xmath12 is the set of free parameters in the continuum model , @xmath13 is the number of emission lines , @xmath14 is the expected counts due to the emission line @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the proportion of an emission line centered at energy @xmath17 and with width @xmath18 that falls into bin @xmath10 .",
    "there are a number of smooth parametric forms to describe the continuum in some bounded energy range ; in this article we parameterize the continuum term @xmath19 as a power law , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the normalization and photon index , respectively .",
    "the emission lines can be modeled via the proportions @xmath16 using narrow gaussian distributions , lorentzian distributions , or delta functions ; the counts due to the emission line are distributed among the bins according to these proportions .",
    "while the gaussian or lorentzian function parameterizes an emission line in terms of center and width , the center is the only free parameter with a delta function ; the width of the delta function is effectively the width of the energy bin in which it resides .    while the model in equation  [ park",
    ": eq : ideal ] is of primary scientific interest , a more complex statistical model is needed to address the data collection processes mentioned in  [ park : sec : hea ] .",
    "we use the term _ statistical model _ to refer to the model that combines the _ source _ or _",
    "astrophysical model _ with a model for the stochastic processes involved in data collection and recording .",
    "thus , in addition to the source model , the statistical model describes such processes as instrument response and background contamination . specifically , to account for the data collection processes , equation  [ park : eq : ideal ] is modified via @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the expected observed poisson counts in detector channel @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the set of detector channels , @xmath27 is the probability that a photon that arrives with energy corresponding to bin @xmath10 is recorded in detector channel @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 is the so - called redistribution matrix or rmf commonly used in x - ray analysis ) , @xmath30 is the effective area ( i.e. , arf , a calibration file associated with the x - ray observation ) of bin @xmath10 , @xmath31 is the probability that a photon with energy @xmath9 is _ not _ absorbed , @xmath32 is the collection of parameters for absorption , and @xmath33 is a poisson intensity of the background counts in channel @xmath28 . while the scatter probability @xmath27 and the effective area @xmath30 are presumed known from calibration , the absorption probability is parameterized using a smooth function ; see @xcite for details . to quantify background contamination ,",
    "a second data set is collected that is assumed to consist only of background counts ; the background photon arrivals are also modeled as an inhomogeneous poisson process .",
    "unfortunately , the statistical methods and algorithms developed in @xcite can not be directly applied to fitting _",
    "narrow _ emission lines .",
    "there are three obstacles that must be overcome in order to extend bayesian highly structured models to spectra containing narrow lines .",
    "in particular , we must develop ( 1 ) new computational algorithms , ( 2 ) statistical summaries and methods for inference under highly multimodal posterior distributions , and ( 3 ) statistical tests that allow us to quantify the statistical support in the data for including an emission line or lines in the model .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to extend the methods of @xcite in these three directions , and to evaluate and illustrate our proposals .",

    "although the details of this generalization are well beyond the scope of this article , we can offer a heuristic description ; a more detailed description is given in appendix  [ ap : alg ] .",
    "readers who are interested in the necessary theoretical development of the statistical computation techniques are directed to @xcite and @xcite .    the algorithms used by @xcite to fit the structured bayesian model described in ",
    "[ park : sec : model ] are based on the probabilistic properties of the statistical models .",
    "for example , the parameters of a gaussian line profile can be fit by iteratively attributing a subset of the observed photons to the line profile and using the mean and variance of these photon energies to update the center and width of the line profile .",
    "the updated parameters of the line profile are used to again attribute a subset of the photons to the line , i.e. , to stochastically select a subset of the photons that are likely to have arisen out of the physical processes at the source corresponding to the emission line .",
    "these algorithms are typically very stable . for example , they only return statistically meaningful parameters because the algorithms themselves mimic the probabilistic characteristics of the statistical model .",
    "the family of expectation / maximization ( em ) algorithms @xcite and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods such as the gibbs sampler @xcite are the examples of statistical algorithms of this sort .",
    "a drawback of these algorithms is that in some situations they can be slow to converge . when fitting the location of a gaussian emission line , for example , the location is updated more slowly if the line profile is narrower",
    "this is because only photons with energies very close to the current value of the line location can be attributed to the line .",
    "updating the line location with the mean of the energies of these photons can not result in a large change in the emission line location .",
    "the situation becomes chronic when a delta function is used to model the line profile : the line location parameter sticks at its starting value throughout the iteration .",
    "it is to circumvent this difficulty that we develop both new em - type algorithms @xcite and new mcmc samplers specially tailored for fitting narrow lines .",
    "our new samplers are motivated by the gibbs sampler , but constitute a non - trivial generalization of gibbs sampling known as partially collapsed gibbs sampling @xcite ; see appendix  [ ap : alg ] .",
    "our updated versions of both classes of algorithms are able to fit narrow lines by avoiding the attribution of photons to the emission line during the iteration .",
    "such algorithms tend to require fewer iterations to converge regardless of the width of the emission line .",

    "prior distribution _ can be used to quantify information from other sources or to impose structure on a set of parameters .",
    "the prior distribution is combined with the likelihood to form a _",
    "posterior distribution_. the prior distribution is denoted by @xmath37 and the posterior distribution by @xmath38 .",

    "using bayes theorem , the prior distribution and the likelihood function are combined to form the posterior distribution via @xmath39 where the last proportionality holds because @xmath40 does not depend on @xmath3 and , given the observed data , is considered a constant .",
    "bayesian statistical inferences are made in terms of probability statements , which are quantified using various numerical summaries of the posterior distribution . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider a stylized right - skewed distribution ; see figure  [ park : fig : skewed ] .",
    "this distribution is similar to the posterior distribution of the expected counts due to the emission line  @xmath15 , @xmath14 , because this parameter is necessarily non - negative .",
    "although from a bayesian perspective the posterior distribution of a model parameter is the complete summary of statistical inference for that parameter , it is often useful to summarize the posterior distribution using point estimates or intervals .",
    "commonly used bayesian point estimates of a parameter are the mean , median , and mode(s ) of the posterior distribution .",
    "error bars for the point estimates can be computed based on the variation of the posterior distribution .",
    "the equal - tail interval and the highest posterior density ( hpd ) interval are both commonly used summaries of uncertainty .",
    "for example , a 68% equal - tail posterior interval is the central interval of the posterior distribution and corresponds to the range of values of the parameter above and below which lies exactly 16% of the posterior probability .",
    "a 68% hpd interval , on the other hand , is the interval of values that contains 68% of posterior probability and within which the density is never lower than that outside the interval .",
    "the 68% hpd interval is the shortest possible interval that accounts for 68% of the posterior probability .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ park : fig : skewed](a ) and  ( b ) .",
    "the equal - tail interval achieves the same probability as the hpd interval by excluding a more likely region and by including a less likely region .",
    "when the posterior distribution is unimodal and symmetric , the equal - tail interval and the hpd interval are identical .",
    "in addition to computing parameter estimates and their error bars , it is often important to check if model assumptions are supported by the data .",
    "one way to do this is to generate simulated data under the model and compare the simulated data with the observed data ; refer to @xcite where this strategy is used to determine whether emission line profiles should be included in the spectral model for a gamma - ray burst .",
    "if the simulated data vary systematically for the observed data , it is an indication that the model used to simulate the data may not be adequate . in a bayesian analysis , we might generate such simulated data from the _ posterior predictive distribution _ , denoted by @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents an unknown future observation and the last equation follows because @xmath43 and @xmath44 are conditionally independent given @xmath3 . in words , the posterior predictive distribution averages the likelihood function over the posterior distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "data are simulated from the posterior predictive distribution and then used to make predictive inferences ; see  [ park : sec : model - check ] for details .",
    "posterior simulation plays a central part in applied bayesian analysis because of the usefulness of a simulation that can often be relatively easily generated from a posterior distribution . in performing simulations , given a large enough sample , a histogram of a monte carlo simulation can provide practically complete information about an actual posterior distribution .",
    "figure  [ park : fig : skewed](c ) shows that the histogram of the monte carlo simulation carries the same information as the posterior distribution itself .",
    "thus , once a monte carlo simulation is obtained , it can be used to compute the mean , variance , percentiles , and other summaries of the posterior distribution . in particular , with a random simulation of size @xmath45 , the posterior mean can be approximated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a simulation from the posterior distribution , @xmath38 .",
    "a 68% equal - tail posterior interval is computed by generating a monte carlo simulation of size @xmath45 from the posterior distribution , sorting the simulated values into increasing order , and choosing the @xmath48$]th and the @xmath49$]th values in the list . with the monte carlo simulation , a 68% hpd region",
    "is computed by segmenting the range of possible parameter values into bins , approximating the posterior probability of each bin as the proportion of the simulated values in that bin , and computing a region by beginning with the bin with the largest posterior probability and adding additional bins in the order of their posterior probabilities until the resulting region contains at least 68% of the posterior probability .",
    "our search for a narrow emission line begins by finding modes of its posterior distribution that correspond to plausible locations of an emission line . to find the modes ( and to compte the profile posterior distribution ) , we use an algorithm optimized for this problem ( i.e. , the rotation(9 ) em - type algorithm , see appendix  [ ap : alg ] and @xcite for details ) . because the posterior distribution of the line location is highly multimodal ( see  [ park : sec : mm ] ) , the algorithm is run using multiple starting values selected across the entire energy range of possible line locations , e.g. , 50 starting values for the line location equally spaced between 1.0  kev and 6.0  kev .",
    "using multiple starting values enables us to identify the important local modes of the posterior distribution .",
    "it is important to use enough starting values to ensure all of the important modes are identified .",
    "this is a standard strategy , long advocated in texts on bayesian data analysis @xcite and is closely related to the computation of the profile posterior distribution described in ",
    "[ park : sec : advise ] .",
    "the profile posterior distribution is computed by fixing the line location at each value of a fine grid , finding the posterior modes of the other model parameters , and plotting the resulting maximum posterior probability as a function of the line location .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the projected delta - chi - square method in the chi - square setting , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mode finding also begins with a fine grid of starting values , but we run the mode finder allowing all parameters including the line location to be fit .",
    "after the modes are found , monte carlo simulation techniques optimized to this problem can be run to further investigate the uncertainty of the possible line locations .",
    "we employ state - of - the - art mcmc samplers , i.e. , partially collapsed gibbs ( pcg ) i for the delta function emission line and pcg ii for the gaussian emission line to obtain the posterior distribution of line location ; see appendix  [ ap : alg ] , @xcite , and @xcite for details . to ensure the convergence of a markov chain constructed by the mcmc samplers , we run multiple chains with overdispersed starting values ( e.g. , 1  kev , 3  kev , and 5  kev for the line location parameter ) and monitor the convergence qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "for example , we compute the estimate of the potential scale reduction @xcite , denoted by @xmath50 , for all parameters of interest . if @xmath50 is near 1 ( e.g. , below 1.2 ) for each of the parameters , we collect the second halves of the chains together and use these monte carlo draws for inference ; see @xcite for theoretical justification and discussion .",
    "there are of course many strategies that one might employ to construct efficient monte carlo samplers .",
    "methods based on annealing or tempering , or that use explicitly parallel methods are often useful for exploring multimodal posterior distributions . given the low autocorrelation of the simulated values produced by our method , we have not pursued these strategies .",
    "fitting a narrow emission line often tends to yield a highly multimodal posterior distribution of the line location , as shown in figure  [ park : fig : hpd ] .",
    "thus , we are interested in the two types of intervals for the posterior distributions : an equal - tail posterior interval and an hpd region .",
    "figure  [ park : fig : hpd ] illustrates a 68% equal - tail posterior interval and a 68% hpd region for the line location when its posterior distribution is highly multimodal .",
    "this is only an example of a highly multimodal posterior distribution .",
    "we come to the details of our analysis of a line location in  [ park : sec : simul ] .",
    "the 68% equal - tail posterior interval is a central interval , so that it includes segments with nearly zero posterior probability here and there within the interval . because the posterior distribution of the line location in figure  [ park : fig : hpd ] is multimodal , the 68% hpd region consists of the four shaded disjoint intervals ; notice that the height of each of the histogram bars outside the hpd region is less than that of those within the region .",
    "in such a multimodal posterior distribution , the hpd region not only is shorter in length but also conveys more information as to likely locations of the line than does the equal - tail interval .        in figure  [ park :",
    "fig : hpd ] , we use a coarse binning to illustrate the distinction between the equal - tail posterior interval and hpd region .",
    "this results in a posterior region that is relatively imprecise ; in our spectral analysis , we use a finer binning to construct a more precise region from a monte carlo simulation . when the posterior distribution of the line location is plotted with the same fine binning as the _ chandra _ energy spectrum",
    ", however , it may not be smooth due to monte carlo errors , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] .",
    "an hpd region computed from the unsmoothed posterior distribution may result in a combination of too many posterior intervals . to avoid such fragmentation of hpd regions , we use gaussian kernel smoothing to smooth the posterior distribution before we compute hpd regions .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] presents the smoothed posterior distribution resulting from applying gaussian kernel smoothing with standard deviation equal to the bin size of the _ chandra _ energy spectrum , i.e. , 0.01  kev .",
    "the smoothed posterior distribution smooths out lower posterior probabilities but does not flatten higher posterior probabilities too much .",
    "we propose a new graphical summary to better describe the hpd regions of a ( smoothed ) multimodal posterior distribution .",
    "an _ hpd graph _ is constructed by plotting a series of hpd regions against their corresponding hpd levels .",
    "for example , for the data set used to compute the posterior distribution in figure  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] , we compute 100 hpd regions , one for each of 100 levels , 1% , 2% , @xmath51 , and 100% . each of these regions is a union of possible values of the line location .",
    "we can plot the line location on the horizontal axis and the level on the vertical axis .",
    "each of the 100 hpd regions can then be plotted as a union of horizonal line intervals at the appropriate level of the hpd region on the vertical axis .",
    "the resulting hpd graph lets us visualize many hpd regions with varying levels , so that all the important modes of a multimodal distribution can be effectively summarized with their relative posterior probabilities . as an illustration",
    ", we computed the three hpd regions with levels 50% , 68% , and 95% , and plotted them in the middle panel of figure  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] along with the smoothed posterior distribution .",
    "the solid lines indicate the disjoint intervals that compose each hpd region , and the dotted lines the intervals outside the hpd region .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] shows the hpd graph in grey with the three hpd intervals from the middle plot superimposed .",
    ", where each marginal standard deviation corresponds to the size of an energy bin in the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "based on the smoothed posterior distribution , we compute ten 2-d hpd regions with levels ranging from 10% to 100% .",
    "these regions are plotted with different shades of grey in the 2-d hpd graph shown in the right panel.,width=576 ]    when there are two parameters of interest , the 1-d hpd graph can be extended to a 2-d hpd graph .",
    "that is , a joint posterior distribution is computed from a monte carlo simulation by using bivariate gaussian kernel smoothing and used to construct 2-d hpd regions with various levels .",
    "these hpd regions can then be plotted with different shades of grey .",
    "for example , figure  [ park : fig : twod - hpd - illust ] shows the 2-d hpd graph computed for the joint posterior distribution of two possible line locations ; see  [ park : sec : simul2 ] for further discussion on the scatter plot .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ park : fig : twod - hpd - illust ] is an unsmoothed joint posterior distribution .",
    "after applying bivariate gaussian kernel smoothing , 10 hpd regions ( one for each of 10 levels , 10% , 20% , ... , and 100% ) are computed and plotted with different shades of grey from black ( 10% ) to white ( 100% ) , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ park : fig : twod - hpd - illust ] .",
    "hpd regions with lower levels contain pixels with higher posterior probabilities , so that darker pixels indicate more probable regions of the two line locations .",
    "multimodal likelihoods and posterior distributions pose another challenge for statistical analysis .",
    "the calibration of many standard statistical procedures is based on the asymptotic gaussian nature of the likelihood and posterior distribution .",
    "thus , standard methods for computing error bars and confidence intervals rely on the likelihood being at least approximately gaussian .",
    "when the likelihood function exhibits the multimodal features that we see in figures  [ park : fig : hpd - illust ] and [ park : fig : twod - hpd - illust ] , these standard results simply do not apply .",
    "one consequence of this is that the nominal level of an interval may not match its frequency coverage .",
    "that is , if we were able to repeat our observation many times , we would find that percentage of intervals that contain the true line location might differ from the nominal level of the interval . in  [ park : sec : simul ] , we find that the posterior distribution is highly multimodal when the true emission line is weak or there are several emission lines in a spectrum . in this case , we also find that by _ misspecifying _ the model we are able to improve the frequency properties of our proposed method .",
    "in particular , we find that using a delta function line profile improves the properties of our procedure even when the true line has appreciable width .      as discussed in  [ park : sec : mm ] , the posterior distribution of a narrow emission line location tends to be highly multimodal . in this case , the profile posterior distribution can be used as a handy and quick - to - compute summary of the posterior distribution to explore the possible locations of a spectral line .",
    "the profile posterior distribution is the posterior distribution of a parameter evaluated at the values of the other parameters that maximize the posterior distribution .",
    "the profile posterior distribution is a bayesian analogue to the profile likelihood , a standard likelihood method for dealing with nuisance parameters ; see @xcite or @xcite for applications of the profile likelihood . in the context of parameter estimation , the distribution of the minimum @xmath2 statistic described by @xcite is closely related to the profile posterior distribution .",
    "generally we do not advocate using the profile posterior distribution as a substitute for the marginal posterior distribution because interval or region estimates computed with the profile posterior distribution have rather unpredictable statistical properties .",
    "the marginal posterior distribution is obtained by integrating out ( i.e. , averaging over ) the other parameters and computing the marginal posterior distribution requires sophisticated numerical integration methods such as mcmc especially when the dimension of the nuisance parameters is large . however",
    ", the profile posterior distribution can be computed without mcmc and , as an analogue to the marginal posterior distribution , can be used to roughly examine the posterior distribution of a model parameter .",
    "thus , we believe the profile posterior distribution is well suited for the initial exploration of the data because it gives a clear and reliable set of potential locations for spectral lines .    the profile posterior distribution can be computed on a fine grid of the possible values of the line location by running an optimizer to maximize over the other model parameters for each value of the line location on the grid ; we recommend using stable optimizers such as em - type algorithms @xcite .",
    "the profile posterior distribution of the line location computed in this way is computationally less demanding and cheaper in terms of cpu time than the marginal posterior distribution produced by monte carlo methods such as mcmc .",
    "our simulation study is conducted to assess the validity of the highly structured multilevel spectral model discussed in  [ park : sec : model ] , to illustrate the connection between the multimodal posterior distribution of a single narrow emission line and evidence for multiple lines , to illustrate the possible advantage of the misspecification of an emission line width , and to illustrate the relationship among gaussian line parameters .",
    "we consider the following six cases that we believe are representative of the cases that are of general interest :    case  1 : : :    there is no emission line in the spectrum .",

    "case  3 : : :    there is a moderate gaussian emission line at 2.85  kev with    @xmath54  kev and    @xmath55  kev in the spectrum . case  4 : : :    there is a narrow gaussian emission line at 2.85  kev with    @xmath56  kev and    @xmath57  kev in the spectrum .",
    "case  5 : : :    there are two narrow gaussian emission lines with    @xmath56  kev , one at 1.20  kev with    @xmath58  kev and the other at 2.85  kev with    @xmath59  kev in the spectrum .",
    "case  6 : : :    there are two narrow gaussian emission lines with    @xmath56  kev , one at 1.20  kev with    @xmath58  kev and the other at 2.85  kev with    @xmath57  kev in the spectrum .",
    "that is , each spectrum has either 0 , 1 , or 2 lines .",
    "data are recorded in an energy grid with bin width 0.01  kev .",
    "thus , the narrow emission line ( i.e. , cases  2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) corresponds to about 17 energy bins and the moderate one ( i.e. , case  3 ) about 85 energy bins , using @xmath60 standard deviations .",
    "as compared to the _ chandra _ resolution , the delta function emission line profile corresponds to 1 energy bin and thus it does not correctly specify the width of the gaussian emission lines in this simulation . through the simulation study , however , we illustrate possible advantage of this model misspecification in producing valid and efficient estimates and associated uncertainties for the line location .",
    "we show that using delta functions emission lines in the model is a useful strategy even when the true line occupies multiple bins .    for each of the six spectra ,",
    "we generate twenty test data sets ( 120 data sets in total ) each with about 1500 counts similar to the observed number of counts in the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum of pg1634 + 706 analyzed in  [ park : sec : quasar ] , mimicking the real data situation .",
    "each spectrum has a power law continuum with @xmath61@xmath625 and @xmath63 .",

    "the marginal posterior density is smoothed using gaussian kernel smoothing with standard deviation 0.01  kev , as described in ",
    "[ park : sec : mm ] .    when there is no emission line in the spectrum ( i.e. , case  1 ) , the posterior distribution of the delta function line location is highly multimodal .",
    "in the case of a weak narrow gaussian emission ( i.e. , case  2 ) , the marginal posterior distribution often remains highly multimodal , but one mode typically identifies the true line location . in practice , the local mode(s ) of such a highly multimodal posterior distribution may suggest plausible line locations and show evidence for multiple lines ; see  [ park : sec : simul2 ] .",
    "even with a moderate line ( i.e. , case  3 ) , the true line location appears well estimated with the marginal posterior distribution of the delta function line location .",
    "as we shall see in table  [ park : tbl : simulhpd ] , however , in this case the resulting posterior region under - covers the true values because the true line is 85 times wider than the specified model . with the strong narrow gaussian line ( i.e. , case  4 ) , the posterior distribution of the line location tends to be unimodal , and the posterior mode correctly identifies the true line location . the posterior distribution for case  5 in figure  [ park : fig : simul ] is bimodal , with the modes corresponding to the two true line locations .",
    "when multiple lines are present in a spectrum , the posterior distribution of the single line location can be multimodal , as shown in the case  5 of figure  [ park : fig : simul ] .",
    "thus the multiple modes may be indicative of multiple lines ; see  [ park : sec : simul2 ] for details .",
    "when one of two narrow gaussian emission lines is much stronger ( i.e. , case  6 ) , the single delta function line model tends to identify only one of the two true line locations . to visualize the uncertainty of the fitted delta function line location(s ) ,",
    "the bottom two rows of figure  [ park : fig : simul ] show the hpd graphs constructed with 100 hpd regions as described in ",
    "[ park : sec : mm ] .",
    "the multimodality in the marginal posterior distribution of a single line location may indicate the existence of multiple lines in a spectrum , provided the lines are well separated .",
    "when a model is fitted with one emission line , modes in the likelihood function of the line location correspond to ranges of energy with excess emission relative to the continuum .",
    "multiple modes in the likelihood indicate that there are multiple ranges of energy with such excess emission .",
    "the height of the mode is indicative of the degree of excess .",
    "thus , if there are several emission lines , we might expect to see several corresponding modes in the likelihood . if there is one energy range that dominates in terms of excess emission , however , it corresponds to the dominate mode of the likelihood .",
    "thus , if there are lines of very different intensities , only the strongest ones may show up as a mode of the likelihood .",
    "this can be seen by comparing case  5 and case  6 in figure  [ park : fig : simul ] .",
    "if there is evidence for multiple lines in a spectrum or if we suspect multiple lines a priori , we can fit a model with two or more lines .",
    "we illustrate this using simulated data under case  2 ( one narrow line ) and case  5 ( two narrow lines ) . beginning with case  2 ,",
    "the actual spectrum has only one line , but we investigate what happens when we fit two lines to this data .",
    "a scatterplot of the two fitted line locations identified when fitting two emission lines to one of the data sets generated under case  2 is presented in the top left panel of figure  [ park : fig : simul - twolines ] .",
    "there is a label switching problem between the two fitted line locations because of the symmetry of the emission lines in the model .",
    "we can remove the symmetry by imposing a constraint on line locations . to do this",
    ", we first fit the model with a single delta function line profile and compute the posterior mode of its line location . returning to the model with two fitted delta functions , we separate the two fitted line locations by setting the  first \" line location to be the one closest to the posterior mode . in case  2 ,",
    "the posterior mode for the single line location is 2.815  kev , so that the first line location is the line location closest to 2.815  kev and the second line is the other location .",
    "the two panels in the top right corner of figure  [ park : fig : simul - twolines ] show the resulting marginal posterior distributions of the two fitted line locations .",
    "as shown in the figure , the marginal posterior distribution of the first line location correctly identifies the true line location .",
    "the spectrum used to generate the data under case  2 has no second line , so that the marginal posterior distribution of the second line is highly multimodal . in practice",
    ", we may take the local mode(s ) in the second marginal posterior distribution as candidates for another line location .",
    "however , the resulting hpd regions for the second line are wide , indicating that either there is no second line or if there is , it can not be well identified .",
    "when two emission lines are present in a spectrum , we follow the same procedure as illustrated using the data generated under case  5 .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure  [ park : fig : simul - twolines ] shows the scatterplot of two line locations identified in the spectrum of case  5 .",
    "label - switching is handled as above using the posterior mode for the single line location , which is computed as 2.855  kev .",
    "the fitted marginal posterior distributions of the first and second line locations are given in the bottom right corner of figure  [ park : fig : simul - twolines ] .",
    "when there are two emission lines in a spectrum , the two true line locations are precisely specified by the two marginal posterior distributions .",
    "this is a verification of what is suggested by the multiple modes in the marginal posterior distribution of the single line location shown in figure  [ park : fig : simul ] .",
    "the possibility of model misspecification when using a delta function to model an emission line depends on both the width of the true line and the resolution of the detector .",
    "misspecification only occurs when the line is not contained in one energy bin , and we shall illustrate that such misspecification only has statistical consequences for the fitted line location if it is very severe . indeed there can be a possible statistical advantage of using a delta function rather than a gaussian line if we know the spectral line is not too wide .",
    "as a toy example , consider a simple gaussian model with known standard deviation : when @xmath64 , a 95% confidence interval for @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "if we misspecify the modal as @xmath67 with @xmath68 , the resulting interval for @xmath65 is shorter and has lower coverage .",
    "we similarly underrepresent the error bars of an emission line location when we use a delta function for a line that is not contained in one energy bin .",
    "we expect this to reduce both the length and coverage of the confidence regions .",
    "the advantage or disadvantage of this strategy is not immediately clear , however , since the nominal coverage of the intervals is based on an asymptotic gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution which clearly does not apply in this setting .",
    "nonetheless , our simulation study illustrates that the use of a delta function line profile can result in a shorter and more informative hpd region while maintaining good coverage .",
    "we now turn to the computation of hpd regions and the possible statistical advantage of using delta functions in place of narrow gaussian emission lines .",
    "we fit a spectral model that includes a single delta function line or a single narrow gaussian line to the twenty simulated data sets generated under each of the 6 cases . after smoothing the marginal posterior distribution using gaussian kernel smoothing ,",
    "we construct 95% hpd regions for the line location , as shown in figure  [ park : fig : simul-10datasets ] . for visual clarity , we present results only for the first ten simulated data sets in figure  [ park : fig : simul-10datasets ] ; results from all twenty simulated data sets are discussed in table  [ park : tbl : simulhpd ] . because there is no emission line in the spectrum used to simulate data under case  1 , the 95% hpd regions for the line location are very wide and show large uncertainties for the fitted line location .",
    "when there is at least one strong emission line ( i.e. , cases  3 , 4 , and 6 ) , both line models produce comparable hpd regions , although those computed under the gaussian line model appear somewhat wider .",
    "the tradeoff between the two line models becomes evident when there is no strong emission line in the spectrum ( i.e. , cases  2 and 5 ) . in case  2 , the 95% hpd regions for a single gaussian line location are somewhat wider . with the same nominal level , the delta function line model yields more compact and informative hpd regions .",
    "an added advantage of the delta function line model occurs in case  5 when the 95% hpd regions for a single delta function line location consist of two disjoint hpd intervals which simultaneously contain the two true line locations ; this behavior is more often observed with the delta function line model ( 2 times out of 20 ) than the gaussian line model ( 1 time out of 20 ) .",

    "each of the 95% hpd regions is composed of a number of disjoint intervals .",
    "only the intervals that have posterior probabilities greater than 5% are presented in table  [ park : tbl : hpds ] , so that the probabilities may sum to less than 95% .",
    "for example , the two intervals of obs - id  47 presented in table  [ park : tbl : hpds ] have a combined posterior probability of 80.96% and the other eleven intervals not shown in the table have a posterior probability of about 14.04% , for a total of 95% .",

    "thus we add 1/15000 to the posterior probability of each energy bin and renormalize each of the posterior distributions .",
    "this allows the product given in equation  [ park : eq : combined ] to be computed for each energy bin and is somewhat conservative as it increases the posterior uncertainty corresponding to each of the individual data sets .",

    "with the _ chandra _ observations of pg1634 + 706 , we consider the same spectral model discussed in  [ park : sec : model ] except that we compare three models for the emission line :    model  0 : : :    there is no emission line in the spectrum .",

    "the comparison between models  0 and  1 shows stronger evidence for the line location because we are using extra a priori information about the plausible line location .",
    "this article presents methods to detect , identify , and locate narrow emission lines in x - ray spectra via a highly structured multilevel spectral model that includes a delta function line profile .",

    "consider a simplified example of an _ ideal instrument _ that is not subject to the data contamination processes .",
    "in particular , the redistribution matrix is an identity matrix , the effective area is constant , there are no absorption features , and there is no background contamination .",
    "in addition , we assume that the continuum is specified with no unknown parameters and that there is a single gaussian emission line that has a known width @xmath88 and a known intensity @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the line location is the only unknown parameter , the source model given in equation  [ park : eq : ideal ] simplifies to @xmath90 and the counts are modeled as @xmath91 .",
    "this model can be fit using the method of data augmentation @xcite by setting @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the counts due to the continuum and the emission line in bin @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "in particular , the em iteratively split the counts into continuum counts and emission line counts .",
    "given the current iterate of the line location , @xmath95 , the e - step  updates the line counts via    e - step  : : :    compute @xmath96 $ ] for each    bin @xmath10 .",

    "although this em algorithm is simple , it breaks down when fitting the location of a _ narrow _ emission line , i.e. , when @xmath88 is small relative to the size of the bins . in the extreme ,",
    "the gaussian line profile becomes a delta function , so that @xmath100 is zero for all bins except the bin containing @xmath95 .",
    "this results in an e - step that computes zero line counts in all bins except the bin containing @xmath95 and finally an m - step that computes @xmath101 .",
    "this means that em will return the same line location at each iteration and that the algorithm will not converge to a mode .    in this simplified example , this difficulty can be avoided by directly maximizing the posterior distribution @xmath102 because of the binning of the data , we can treat possible line locations within each bin as indistinguishable and compute the mode by evaluating equation  [ park : eq : toy - obs - like ] on the fine grid that corresponds to the binning of the data .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the full spectral model described in ",
    "[ park : sec : model ] .",
    "the method of data augmentation can be used to construct efficient algorithms that both fit the parameters in the continuum and the lines and account for instrument response and background contamination . in the case of the narrow emission line ,",

    "the expectation / conditional maximization either ( ecme ) algorithm @xcite allows us to use no data augmentation when updating the line location / width , but the resulting m - step is time consuming owing to the multiple evaluations of the conditional posterior distribution of the line location / width which involve the large dimensional redistribution matrix , @xmath103 .",
    "an intermediate strategy uses the standard data augmentation scheme to adjust for instrument response and background contamination but does not separate continuum and line photons when updating the line location / width .",

    "given the current iterate , @xmath95 , step  1 simulates the line counts in bin @xmath10 via            when this algorithm is applied with a narrow emission line , it breaks down just as the em algorithm does .",
    "when a delta function is used for the line profile , the simulation in equation  [ park : eq : step1 ] results in no line counts in any bin except the one containing the line , and again @xmath65 does not move from its starting value .",

    "although such a sampler may result in efficient computation , care must be taken to be sure the sampler delivers simulations from the target posterior distribution .",
    "this is formalized through the partially collapsed gibbs ( pcg ) sampler of @xcite which outlines the steps that should be taken to ensure proper convergence ; refer to @xcite for the applications and illustrations of pcg samplers .",
    "the pcg samplers can be viewed as the stochastic version of ecme and aecm , thereby allowing us to sample the line location with no data augmentation ( as in ecme ) or partial data augmentation ( as in aecm ) .",
    "thus , the pcg sampler differs from the gibbs sampler developed in @xcite in sampling the line location ( and line width ) , and in the order of sampling steps .",
    "@xcite design two pcg samplers to fit the spectral model with a delta function emission line or a narrow gaussian emission line , which are called pcg  i and pcg  ii , respectively .",
    "as compared to pcg  i , pcg",
    "ii requires one additional sampling step for the line width , so that fitting the narrow gaussian emission line is computationally more demanding than fitting the delta function emission line .",
