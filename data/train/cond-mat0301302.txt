    "the ruthenocuprates are a relatively new class of high-@xmath5 superconductors,@xcite which is attracting much interest for the apparent coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.@xcite in spite of a considerable experimental activity on these compounds , and notably on rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ru-1212 ) , there are still several obscure points regarding their preparation and characterization , and it turns out that nominally identical samples may or may not be superconducting , depending on subtle details of the preparation process.@xcite the o stoichiometry is considered as a possible source of non - uniform properties from sample to sample , but there is a great variety of results regarding the influence of the preparation on the ostoichiometry .",
    "some studies find that the annealing at high temperature in vacuum or inert atmosphere causes considerable o deficiency,@xcite while others find no influence at all@xcite even up to 800  @xmath6c.@xcite it has then proposed that the prolonged annealings affect the cation ordering,@xcite the grain boundaries,@xcite or the microstructure.@xcite it seems that granularity has an important role,@xcite since the near coincidence of the lattice parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 results in the formation of small domains with @xmath10 in any of the three almost equivalent directions .",
    "therefore , some authors attribute the improvement in superconducting properties following long high - temperature anneals to increases in domain size , rather than change in cation composition or o content.@xcite the possibility of a broad range of o stoichiometry would have implications regarding the amount of doping of the cuo@xmath0  planes .",
    "in fact , from both bond valence sum calculations@xcite and x - ray absorption spectroscopies@xcite it is found that the ru cations in ru-1212 exhibit mixed valence ru@xmath11/ru@xmath12 , with @xmath13 = $ ] @xmath14 .",
    "the fraction of ru@xmath11 is considered to be responsible for the doping of the cuo@xmath0 planes , with @xmath15 $ ] , due to the relative cu / ru stoichiometry .",
    "the value @xmath16 deduced in this way , however , is much larger than that deduced from transport experiments , suggesting that most carriers are trapped by defects or by the ferromegnetic order.@xcite    in the present work we address the issue whether o vacancies may be present in ru-1212 by anelastic spectroscopy measurements .",
    "such a technique is particularly suited , since , similarly to the well known case of yba@xmath0cu@xmath17o@xmath18 , an o vacancy in the ruo@xmath0 or cuo@xmath0 plane of ru-1212 creates an anisotropic strain that reorients by 90@xmath6 after a jump ; therefore , the diffusive motion of the o vacancies gives rise to a well detectable anelastic relaxation effect .",
    "policrystalline samples of composition rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 have been synthesized by solid state reaction of high purity stoichiometric powders of ruo@xmath0 , gd@xmath0o@xmath19 , cuo and srco@xmath19 , following a well established procedure described in previous works.@xcite the final step , aging at 1070  @xmath20c in flowing o@xmath0 for one week followed cooling at 50  @xmath20c / h , resulted in the formation of a sintered ingot that was cut into bars .",
    "some samples have been characterized structurally by x - ray powder diffraction and by magnetic susceptibility in a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "the superconducting transitions presented the two step behaviour typical of granular high-@xmath21 superconductors , with intragrain onset at @xmath22  k and the intergrain one at @xmath23  k. figure [ fig mvst ] shows the field cooled and zero field cooled magnetization curves measured in a field of 0.55  mt , as described in ref . .",
    "the anelastic measurements were made on a bar of @xmath24  mm@xmath25 .",
    "the complex young s modulus @xmath26 , was measured as a function of temperature by suspending the bar on thin thermocouple wires and electrostatically exciting its flexural modes .",
    "the frequencies @xmath27 of the first three odd flexural modes are in the ratios @xmath28 with @xmath29  khz , and are related to the real part of the young s modulus through @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a geometrical factor and @xmath32 the mass density .",
    "the elastic energy loss coefficient , or the reciprocal of the mechanical quality factor,@xcite is @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the elastic compliance ; the @xmath37 was measured from the decay of the free oscillations or from the width of the resonance peak . an elementary relaxation process , like the hopping of an o atom or vacancy with rate @xmath38 , contributes to the imaginary part of the compliance with@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the elastic dipole of the defect in configuration @xmath41 : @xmath42 is the anelastic strain due to a homogeneous distribution of defects with molar concentration @xmath10 , all in the @xmath43th configuration .",
    "considering the relaxation from o atoms or vacancies in the ruo@xmath0 or cuo@xmath0 planes , and at first neglecting the small rotation of the ruo@xmath44 octahedra about their @xmath10 axis,@xcite there are only two orientations @xmath45 of the elastic dipole , depending whether the o atom or vacancy ( v@xmath46 ) has the nearest neighboring ru / cu atoms along the @xmath47 or @xmath48 direction ( corresponding to the o(1 ) and o(5 )  sites in ybco@xcite ) . the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig octa ] shows a projection of the unrotated o octahedra on the @xmath49 plane with the two possible types of v@xmath46 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are chosen following ref . , while the @xmath48 and @xmath47 directions are at 45@xmath20 , parallel to the ru - o bonds .",
    "strain is a centrosymmetric second rank tensor,@xcite and can therefore be represented as an ellipsoid with the principal axes representing the deviations of the lengths with respect to the reference unstrained sphere ( dotted circles).@xcite the ellipsoids in fig .",
    "[ fig octa ] represent contractions around the v@xmath46 , more pronounced along the directions of the nearest neighbor ru atoms .",
    "the lower part of the figure includes the ( slightly exaggerated ) rotations of the octahedra ; the symmetry of the elastic dipoles , however , remains unaltered , as can be seen from the mirror planes passing through the v@xmath46 , which are still perpendicular to the @xmath48 or @xmath47 directions .",
    "analogously to the case of ybco,@xcite if we call @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then it is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the anelastic strain associated with an o jump is therefore @xmath57 , and causes relaxation of the @xmath58 compliance , with @xmath59 entering into eq .",
    "( [ ds \" ] ) ; the factor @xmath60 in that expression is appropriate for the case of a @xmath61 orthorhombic elastic dipole in a tetragonal crystal.@xcite the above expression is peaked at @xmath62 , and since the measurements are made at the resonance frequencies @xmath63 as a function of temperature , one finds peaks at the temperatures @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , measurements at different frequencies provide the temperature dependence of the rate @xmath66 , which generally follows the arrhenius law : @xmath67 where @xmath68  is the energy barrier for the o jump . assuming that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are almost constant over the temperature range in which the peak is observed , eq .",
    "( [ ds \" ] ) describes also the peaks in @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 where the relaxation strength @xmath74 corresponds to the static elastic susceptibility . a process characterized by a spectrum of relaxation times",
    "may be described by the fuoss - kirkwood distribution of relaxation rates,@xcite yielding for the frequency dispersion factor @xmath75 ^{-1}$ ] instead of @xmath76 ^{-1}$ ] ; the imaginary part of the dispersion to be inserted into eqs .",
    "( [ ds \" ] ) and ( [ q-1 ] ) therefore becomes @xmath77",
    "figure [ fig spectra ] presents three measurement runs in vacuum up to 660 , 850 and 920  k ; the lower panel contains the elastic energy loss coefficient , while the upper panel contains the relative change of the young s modulus , where @xmath78 refers to the as prepared state . during the first heating the dissipation is low , and starts increasing above 600  k ( curve 1 ) .",
    "this increase is due to the formation of o vacancies , as confirmed by heating the same sample in a uhv system equipped with a residual gas analyzer ; the trace of the o@xmath0 partial pressure started increasing at 600  k , indicating that this is the temperature of the onset of massive o loss . during the subsequent heating ( curve 2 at @xmath79  k / min ) a @xmath80 peak develops and becomes stable after heating above @xmath81  k. in fact , the @xmath82 curve measured on cooling ( curve 3 , open circles ) is retraced during the subsequent runs :",
    "curve 4 on heating is slightly higher , but curve 5 on cooling ( crosses ) perfectly coincides with curve 3 .",
    "this means that no further loss of o occurs , at least up to 920  k in vacuum .",
    "this fact again is confirmed by outgassing the same sample in the uhv system , and noting that the o outgassing rate at 900  k drops by two orders of magnitude within 10  min .",
    "the amount of o loss has been estimated from the mass variation after oxygenation and outgassing treatments , and ranges between 2.2 and 3% per formula unit after outgassing at 900 - 1000  k for less than 1  h.    from the perfect coincidence of the @xmath80 curves 3 and 5 measured on cooling , also very close to curve 4 on heating , we conclude that curves 35 represent a situation very close to equilibrium and their analysis is meaningful .",
    "the @xmath83 curves reflect the behavior of the acoustic losses , with a negative step in correspondence to the absorption peak.@xcite a transformation to a more symmetric structure where the rotation angle of the ruo@xmath44 octahedra about their @xmath10 axes goes to zero may be expected at high temperature,@xcite but there is no trace of it from room temperature to 930  k. such a transformation should appear in the @xmath83 curves as a jump , dip or change of slope .",
    "the formation of o vacancies in the ruo@xmath0 and possibly cuo@xmath0 planes in ru-1212 should have analogies with the partial filling of the cuo@xmath84 planes in yba@xmath0cu@xmath19o@xmath18 . from the structural point of view",
    "the cuo@xmath0 planes of ru-1212 correspond to the cuo@xmath0 planes of ybco , which remain stoichiometric , while the ruo@xmath0 planes of ru-1212 correspond to the cuo@xmath84 planes of ybco.@xcite based on this structural analogy , we assume that the o  vacancies form mainly in the ruo@xmath4 planes .",
    "it is also plausible that such planes may accommodate v@xmath85 , in view of the mixed valence displayed by ru both in ru-1212@xcite and ru-1222;@xcite in the latter compound , the o stoichiometry seems to affect the ru valence,@xcite again supporting the hypothesis of v@xmath46 in the ru planes .",
    "the case of ybco is complicated , since only half filling of the available o sites can be achieved , with the formation of parallel cu - o  chains in the ortho - i phase . a  complex @xmath86 phase diagram results , which can be reproduced , for example , introducing three different short range o - o interaction energies ( so called asynnni model).@xcite the diffusive jumps of the o atoms in the cuo@xmath84 planes in the ortho - i phase have been studied by anelastic relaxation,@xcite finding that hopping occurs over a barrier of @xmath87  ev ; it has also been shown that there are actually two additional distinct hopping rates , with smaller activation energies , for o atoms belonging to chains in the ortho - ii and tetragonal phases@xcite and for isolated o atoms.@xcite in spite of the numerous investigations , the anelastic spectrum due to o hopping in ybco has not been quantitatively explained in terms of the microscopic parameters , like the elastic dipole associated to an o atom and the short - range o - o interaction energies , e.g. of the asynnni model .",
    "still , it has been shown that the relaxation strength ( the static elastic susceptibility )  exhibits a curie - weiss enhancement and the relaxation rate a critical slowing near the orthorhombic / tetragonal phase transformation,@xcite corresponding to the ordering of o in the o(1 ) sublattice .",
    "the anisotropy of the elastic dipole in ybco is found to be @xmath88 from the dependence of the cell parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the o content both in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases.@xcite the same information can hardly be obtained from anelastic measurements on ceramic samples , due to the heavy corrections necessary for the angular averaging of the elastic constants and the porosity of the samples.@xcite      the case of ru-1212 should be simpler , since the ruo@xmath0 planes remain close to the full stoichiometry even after prolonged outgassing ; this can be described in terms of a deficiency @xmath89 in ruo@xmath90 with @xmath91 , as deduced from the mass variation after oxygenation / outgassing treatments .",
    "this means that one can consider the dynamics of isolated or at most paired o vacancies with small concentration @xmath92 , instead of more complex chain structures .",
    "one can therefore treat the o vacancy exactly like an o atom in a nearly empty cuo@xmath84 plane , and with an elastic dipole @xmath93 .",
    "a complication arises from the fact that the main peak at @xmath94  k ( 1  khz ) is accompanied by a shoulder at @xmath95  k , indicating that there are actually two distinct relaxation processes associated with v@xmath46 in ru-1212 .",
    "there are various explanations for two distinct relaxation processes associated with v@xmath46 .",
    "one is that v@xmath46 may form stable pairs with a binding energy @xmath96 ; in that case , the reorientation of the vacancy pair would require its temporary dissociation and the corresponding relaxation rate should have an activation energy increased by @xmath97 over the barrier for hopping of a simple v@xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding anelastic relaxation peak would appear at higher temperature , analogously to the case of the diluted interstitial o atoms and o pairs in la@xmath0cuo@xmath98.@xcite the problem with this interpretation is that the peak at lower temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig spectra ] , which should be due to isolated v@xmath46 , has definitely a smaller intensity than the peak at higher temperature . at these low concentrations , @xmath99",
    ", one would expect on the contrary that the isolated v@xmath46 predominate over the v@xmath46 pairs , rendering this explanation unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that the peak at lower temperature is associated with the complex of a v@xmath46 with a defect , for example a cu atom substituting a ru atom ( cu@xmath100 ) .",
    "the fact that the temperature of the cu@xmath101v@xmath46 relaxation is lower than that of v@xmath102 may be understood in terms of a cu@xmath100 environment providing a lower barrier for o hopping , in accordance with the observation that the barrier for o  hopping in the cuo@xmath84 planes of ybco is 1.1  ev , lower than the barrier associated with the main peak in ru-1212 ( see later on ) .",
    "support to the hypothesis of the existence of cu@xmath100 defects comes from the fact that ru@xmath103cu@xmath84sr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 with mixed ru@xmath103cu@xmath84o@xmath0 planes can actually be synthesized and is superconducting.@xcite in addition , superlattice spots in electron diffraction patterns of ru-1212 have been interpreted in terms of domains with intermixed and ordered cu / ru ions in the nominal ruo@xmath0 planes,@xcite or , alternatively , with ordering of mixed valence ru@xmath11/ru@xmath12 ions.@xcite the presence of the minor peak in the anelastic spectra may be accounted for by cu@xmath100 defects dispersed at a concentration much smaller than that of the v@xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath104 , and acting as trapping centers for few v@xmath46 , but also by the minority regions of mixed cu / ru or also ru@xmath11/ru@xmath12 devised in ref . .",
    "note that cu@xmath100 defects in the ruo@xmath0 planes require an equal amount ru@xmath105 in the cuo@xmath0 planes , or the presence of impurity phases rich in ru .",
    "it is also possible to explain the minor peak in the anelastic spectra without invoking cu / ru intermixing , but supposing that that v@xmath46 can form also in the cuo@xmath0 planes of ru-1212 , at concentrations lower than in the ruo@xmath0 planes . in this case",
    "the peak at lower temperature would be due to the minority of faster v@xmath46 in the cuo@xmath0 planes . in what follows",
    "we will focus on the main peak .",
    "attempts to fit the main peak in terms of eqs .",
    "( [ ds\"][fk ] ) yield a mean relaxation rate with @xmath106  s@xmath107 and @xmath108  ev , with a broadening parameter @xmath109 ; such a value for @xmath110 is too high for an o vacancy or any defect .",
    "in addition , it is impossible to reproduce the marked decrease of the peak intensity with increasing temperature ( see the curve at higher frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig fit ] ) .",
    "these features suggests a curie - weiss like enhancement of the relaxation strength , like in ybco,@xcite due to the long range elastic interactions among the v@xmath46 .",
    "the effect of the long range elastic interaction among elastic dipoles has been treated in connection with the oatoms in ybco@xcite and also the interstitial o atoms in bcc metals.@xcite the interaction causes a tendency to cooperative alignment of the dipoles and results in a factor @xmath111 that multiplies both the relaxation strength @xmath112 and time @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the temperature below which the elastic dipoles at concentration @xmath10 start aligning in a same direction .",
    "note that the elastic dipoles can describe equivalently o atoms or vacancies , with opposite sign , and in the present situation it is natural to refer to vacancies .",
    "the relaxation process is then decribed by @xmath115 @xmath116 the divergence of the relaxation time on approaching @xmath5 from above results in a @xmath66 that is steeper than eq .",
    "( [ arrh ] ) , and therefore in a higher apparent energy barrier @xmath68 and prefactor @xmath117 , as presently observed .",
    "the divergence in the relaxation strength results in a peak intensity increasing more than as @xmath118 with decreasing @xmath119 .",
    "figure [ fig fit ] presents a fit with eq .",
    "( [ q-1 cw ] ) , without relying on the usual approximation that the elastic compliance @xmath70 or modulus @xmath69 and therefore also the resonance frequencies @xmath120 are constant .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath37 , fig .",
    "[ fig fit ] reports @xmath121 @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 ^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "this correction for the temperature dependence of the frequency and elastic compliance improves slightly the fit .",
    "the dashed curve is obtained with @xmath125  ev , @xmath126  s , @xmath127  k for the main peak and @xmath128  ev , @xmath129  s , @xmath130 for the smaller peak .",
    "the fit is not perfect , but the main process can be described with very reasonable parameters ; in addition , there is no need of introducing an additional broadening , since the theoretical curve has already the correct width .",
    "the introduction of broadening , e.g. through the fuoss - kirkwood distribution with eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , introduces the additional parameter @xmath131 and allows slightly better fits to be obtained , like the continuous curve with @xmath132  ev , @xmath133  s , @xmath134  k , @xmath135 for the main peak and @xmath136  ev , @xmath137  s , @xmath138 for the smaller peak .",
    "a  probable origin of the peak broadening is the high density of antiphase boundaries between domains with opposite senses of rotation of the octahedra.@xcite it appears , however , that the introduction of a broadening is not the main ingredient for improving the accordance of the data with the curie - weiss expression , eq .",
    "( [ q-1 cw ] ) ; possibly the mean field treatment@xcite of the interactions among the elastic dipoles is not adequate , or some changes of the electronic or structural properties of ru-1212 make the barrier for o hopping temperature dependent , over the wide range of temperature ( 500 - 900  k ) where the peak is observed . for example , the angle of rotation of the ruo@xmath44 octahedra about their @xmath10 axes has been found to decrease almost linearly when temperature increases from 0 to 300  k,@xcite and it might well continue decreasing at higher temperatures . still , from the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig fit ] and others not reported here , it appears that the main peak is due to hopping of the o vacancies with an activation energy of 1.31.4  ev ; in addition , there is considerable critical slowing of the hopping dynamics and enhancement of the elastic susceptibility on approaching an ordering temperature @xmath139  k. the ordering would consist in the preferential occupation of sites of one type , namely with the nearest neighbor ru atoms along either @xmath48 or @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig octa ] ) , and would result in a slightly orthorhombic cell .",
    "it would be similar to the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transformation in ybco , where ooccupies preferentially the o(1 ) instead of the o(5 ) sites , but not necessarily with the formation of chains of vacancies .",
    "the minor relaxation at lower temperature is almost completely masked by the main relaxation process , and the fit does not yield reliable values of the parameters .      a reliable estimate of the shape factor @xmath140 of the elastic dipole tensor associated with an o vacancy can not be done at present .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ ds \" ] ) refers to a single crystal excited on pure @xmath141 mode , while a ceramic sample requires averaging of the elastic constants over the solid angle and corrections due to porosity.@xcite the same is true for ybco , were the shape factor can be estimated from the structural data at different o contents ( @xmath142 0.19 in ref . or 0.25 from the data in ref . ) .",
    "a comparison between ru-1212 and ybco in the ortho - i phase@xcite shows that the peaks due to o hopping have comparable intensities in both materials .",
    "this may at first indicate that ru-1212 has much larger @xmath143 than ybco , since in the present case the concentration of elastic dipoles is @xmath144 ( the concentration of vacancies ) , while in yba@xmath0cu@xmath19o@xmath145 the molar concentration of mobile o atoms or vacancies is @xmath146 .",
    "it should be considered , however , that in the case of orthorhombic ybco , the o atoms jump between sites that are energetically inequivalent , and this reduces the relaxation strength by a factor@xcite @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the equilibrium fractions of occupied sites of type @xmath150 or @xmath47 ; in the ortho - i phase it is @xmath151 and therefore @xmath152 .",
    "the relatively small amplitude of the peak in the ortho - i phase of ybco should therefore be attributed to this effect ; indeed , the relaxation strength reaches values as high as 1 near the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition of ybco,@xcite where @xmath153 .",
    "an estimate of the order of magnitude of @xmath140 in ru-1212 can be made as follows : the polycrystalline average of the reciprocal young s modulus , @xmath154 , assuming uniform stress from grain to grain of a tetragonal crystal ( a different approximation would be that of uniform strain ) , is@xcite @xmath155 of which only @xmath156 relaxes according to eq .",
    "[ ds \" ] ; therefore@xcite @xmath157 and , assuming that the porosity affects in the same way @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the relaxation strength becomes ( including the curie - weiss correction ) @xmath160 the effective young s modulus of our sample was @xmath161  gpa ( the low value is due to a porosity of nearly 50% ) , @xmath162  @xmath25 and assuming @xmath163 , and @xmath164 at @xmath165k from the fit of fig .",
    "[ fig fit ] with @xmath127  k , we find @xmath166 .",
    "there are several sources of error in such an estimate , from the polycrystalline average to the v@xmath46 concentration , but 0.1 is a very reasonable value for the shape factor of the v@xmath46 ; it is @xmath167 times larger than the value estimated for ybco , but @xmath168 times smaller than the shape factor of interstitial o , n and c atoms in bcc metals.@xcite it can be concluded that the high - temperature relaxation processes in ru-1212 can consistently be interpreted in terms of hopping of v@xmath46 , with a shape factor somewhat larger than in ybco .      the flat high - temperature anelastic spectrum of ru-1212 , after the initial oxygenation treatment , indicates absence of o  vacancies or interstitial o atoms ; it can be safely stated that the concentration of such o defects is at least 10 times smaller than after o outgassing , namely of the order of 0.2% or less .",
    "this means that the level of the o  vacancies may be kept as low as @xmath169 also without treatments at high o@xmath4 pressures , and should not exceed in any case @xmath170 .",
    "the latter values are estimated from the mass variation after oxygenation / outgassing treatments up to 1000  k , and correspond to a rather stable concentration of v@xmath46 , as deduced from the stability of the anelastic spectra during aging in vacuum at high temperature . unless assuming that a v@xmath46 may neutralize or trap more than two holes , even a concentration @xmath171 of v@xmath46 would not explain the discrepancy between the hole concentration deduced from the valence of ru and that deduced from transport experiments.@xcite the present study , therefore , even though demonstrates the existence of o  vacancies in ru-1212 , supports the view that the origin for the poor superconducting properties often found in ru-1212 is not in the o stoichiometry .",
    "it has been shown that rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath172 may be prepared with very low ( @xmath173 ) o deficiency , also without treatments in high o@xmath0 pressure , and annealing in vacuum above 600  k introduces o vacancies in the ruo@xmath0 and/or cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "the structural analogy with the cuprates of the ybco family suggests that most of the vacancies are formed in the ruo@xmath0 planes .",
    "the diffusive motion of these vacancies gives rise to an intense anelastic relaxation process , measured as a peak of the elastic energy loss coefficient around 670  k at 1  khz .",
    "the concentration of the o vacancies reaches a plateau estimated as @xmath170 from the mass variation after treatments up to 1000  k in vacuum or o@xmath0 atmosphere .",
    "the analysis of the peak shows that the barrier for the o diffusion is of @xmath2  ev , and the long range elastic interaction among the o  vacancies causes an enhancement of the relaxation strength and time of curie - weiss type , with @xmath139  k.    a minor peak at @xmath95  k might be due to o  vacancies trapped at defects , like cu substituting ru in the ruo@xmath0 planes , or to vacancies in the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
