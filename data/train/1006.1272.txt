    "in this work we have cross - correlated the list of the still unidentified hard x - ray emitters listed in the 4th ibis survey with the archive of all _ xmm - newton _",
    "pointings finding a set of 6 objects with archival data .",
    "first , we studied the epic images in order to find in the ibis error circle the x - ray counterpart(s ) . in the case where an associated source has been found , the _ xmm - newton _ data have then been used together the _ integral - ibis _ spectra to study the broad band slope and investigate the possible nature of the source .",
    "+ in table 4 a summary of our proposed identifications is reported .",
    "+ in a couple of cases no obvious x - ray counterpart has been found from the _ xmm - newton _ observations , like igr j1733312406 and igr j17445 - 2747 . in the first case , no x - ray source has been detected .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the ibis survey data where this source has been found to be transient .",
    "extrapolating to the low energies ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) the spectrum seen by ibis during the source outburst and comparing it with the xmm upper limit , we found a dynamical range of the order of 3000 .",
    "such a high value strongly suggests that igr j173312406 could be either a transient black hole in the galactic bulge or a sfxt although this latter interpretation can be ruled out due to source location off the galactic plane ( @xmath0 5 degrees ) as well as its significantly longer outburst duration compared to classical sfxts .",
    "+ the other case where the xmm observation does not provide a secure x - ray counterpart is that of igr j17445 - 2747 . from the imaging analysis we found a faint xmm source at the border of the ibis error circle which has also been detected by both swift - xrt and chandra . on the other hand , from archival searches we found an xmm slew source well inside the high energy positional uncertainty which has been seen only once by xmm and",
    "therefore is again in perfect agreement with the high energy survey data which classified this source extremely variable ; we therefore associate igr j17445 - 2747 to xmmsl1 j174429.4 - 274609 .",
    "+ in the remaining four cases we have found a convincing x - ray counterpart in the ibis error circle for which it has been possible to search for counterparts in other wavelength bands and also perform the spectral data analysis in the 0.5110 kev band .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained together with the possible ir / optical / radio counterpart found allowed us to investigate on the nature of each source . we conclude that igr j15359 - 5750 is an agn of intermediate type for which we were able to estimate the amount of the complex absorption as well as to give constraints on the reflection and the high energy cut - off .",
    "for the two asca sources ax j1739.3 - 2923 and ax j1740.2 - 2903 we suggest a strongly absorbed galactic nature and for both we argue that they are likely persistent hmxb systems .",
    "more uncertain is the case of igr j18538 - 0102 which is spatially coincident with a hot spot in the supernova remnant g32.1 - 0.9 detected previously by rosat and asca . from the broad band spectral analysis",
    "performed in this work we can conclude that this object is unrelated compact object which happen to coincide with the supernova remnant , probably a background agn that is coincidentally aligned even if no radio counterpart has been found in the more precise xmm error box .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
