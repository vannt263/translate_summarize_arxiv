    "there are several indications that this type of phase transition is not a rare phenomenon in gauge models at finite temperature : one can argue that in some three - dimensional lattice gauge models the deconfinement phase transition is of bkt type as well .",

    "the @xmath1 spin model in the villain formulation  ( [ qpvillain ] ) has been studied analytically in refs .",
    "it was shown that the model has at least two phase transitions when @xmath14 .",
    "the intermediate phase is a massless phase with power - like decay of the correlation function . the critical index @xmath15 has been estimated both from the renormalization group ( rg ) approach of the kosterlitz - thouless type and from the weak - coupling series for the susceptibility .",
    "it turns out that @xmath16 at the transition point from the strong coupling ( high - temperature ) phase to the massless phase , _",
    "i.e. _ the behavior is similar to that of the @xmath7 model . at the transition point",
    "@xmath17 from the massless phase to the ordered low - temperature phase one has @xmath18 .",
    "a rigorous proof that the bkt phase transition does take place , and so that the massless phase exists , has been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite for both villain and standard formulations ( with one non - vanishing coupling @xmath19 ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the standard version with @xmath20 were performed in ref .",
    "results for the critical index @xmath15 agree well with the analytical predictions obtained from the villain formulation of the model .    in this paper",
    "we thoroughly investigate the case @xmath21 , the lowest number where the bkt transition is expected .",
    "precisely , we concentrate on the standard formulation ( [ qpgen ] ) with one non - zero coupling @xmath19 .",
    "the motivation of our study is three - fold :    1 .   to compute critical indices at the transition points , which could serve as checking point of universality",
    "; 2 .   to shed light on the discrepancy in the literature concerning the @xmath0 model ; 3 .   to develop and test a new version of monte carlo cluster algorithm valid for odd values of @xmath2 .",
    "the first motivation is related to the study of the finite - temperature transitions in @xmath22 @xmath1 and @xmath23 lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) .",
    "it is expected that in @xmath22 @xmath1 lgt a deconfinement phase transition takes place at finite temperature .",
    "there is no precise statement about the order of the phase transition , but presumably it is of the bkt type if @xmath24 .",
    "if it is the case , the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite implies that the @xmath22 @xmath1 lgt is in the universality class of @xmath6 vector potts model .",
    "moreover , it can be proven that , in the strong coupling region with respect to the spatial coupling , the @xmath22 @xmath1 lgt reduces to a @xmath6 @xmath1 model with the general boltzmann weight  ( [ qpgen ] ) , and such that @xmath25 , for @xmath21 . here , @xmath26 are effective couplings which depend on the gauge coupling and the temporal extension @xmath27 .",
    "thus , our @xmath0 model represents a good approximation to @xmath22 @xmath0 lgt in this region .",
    "next , let @xmath28 and consider the following effective action in @xmath6 @xmath29 the effective action  ( [ sunaction ] ) can be regarded as the simplest effective model for the polyakov loop which can be derived in the strong coupling region of @xmath22 @xmath23 lgt at finite temperature .",
    "it possesses @xmath1 global symmetry and thus may well exhibit the bkt transitions which belong to the universality class of the corresponding vector potts model .",
    "therefore , our investigation here can be viewed as a preliminary step in studying deconfinement phase transition in @xmath22 @xmath1 and @xmath23 lgts .",
    "the second motivation reflects the fact that many features of the critical behavior of the @xmath0 model are not reliably established . moreover , there are certain discrepancies even in determining the nature of the phase transition , _",
    "i.e. _ whether the phase transition is of bkt type or not .",
    "let us briefly summarize the present state of affairs .",
    "* the rigorous proof of the massless phase existence in @xmath6 @xmath1 models utilizes methods which do not allow to establish the exact value of @xmath2 above which the bkt phase transition exists  @xcite .",
    "* reliable analytical calculations can only be performed with the villain formulation ( [ qpvillain ] ) ; the rg study of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the massless phase exists for all @xmath24 .",
    "* some information on the phase structure of the general @xmath1 spin models can be obtained through the duality transformations ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these transformations can not be used to establish the position of the critical points in the @xmath0 model  @xcite .",
    "however , duality transformations relate the two critical points and thus can be used to verify the accuracy of numerical data .",
    "moreover , one can predict an approximate phase diagram and argue that the massless phase and the bkt transition exist for @xmath21 in a certain region of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "important in this context is the rigorous proof of the existence of the massless phase , constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the generalized villain formulation .",
    "this generalized formulation contains the vector potts model defined in  ( [ qpgen ] ) with one non - zero coupling @xmath19 as a particular case . + for completeness we mention that in refs .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that there is only one first order phase transition in @xmath0 model .",
    "this , however , contradicts the rigorous results of  @xcite . * an analytical prediction for the critical index @xmath15 has been obtained for the villain formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath16 and @xmath30 ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "the situation remains unclear for the index @xmath31 which governs the behavior of the correlation length .",
    "normally , the value of @xmath31 can be estimated from the solution of the rg equations like in the @xmath7 model  @xcite .",
    "the analytical solution of the system of rg equations for @xmath1 vector models is unknown ( see ref .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , there are no strong theoretical arguments indicating that @xmath32 , similarly to the @xmath7 model",
    ". moreover , the strong coupling expansion of the @xmath0 model combined with pad approximants predicts that @xmath33  @xcite . *",
    "monte carlo simulations of the @xmath1 model have been performed in refs .",
    "results of ref .",
    "@xcite , though obtained on rather small lattices , indicate that the bkt transition takes place in models with @xmath34 .",
    "this contradicts the results of  @xcite which well agree with the bkt behavior for @xmath35 .",
    "+ however , most recent simulations of the helicity modulus in the @xmath0 model at @xmath36 do not agree with what is expected at the bkt transition  @xcite .",
    "namely , at the critical point the helicity modulus is expected to jump discontinuously to zero , and the jump is observed for @xmath37 model , while in @xmath0 the helicity modulus stays small but non - vanishing in the high - temperature region @xmath38 .    still , it remains unclear how this behavior of the helicity modulus influences other features of the bkt transition .",
    "the key feature of the massless bkt phase in @xmath1 models is the enhancement of the discrete symmetry of the hamiltonian : the symmetry of the ground state in the intermediate phase is rather @xmath39 than @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in a characteristic distribution of the complex magnetization , in the power - like decay of the correlation functions in the massless phase , in the vanishing of the beta - function , etc .. also , on the basis of the universality one could conjecture that the critical indices in the @xmath0 model are the same both in the standard and villain formulations .",
    "we are not aware of any numerical calculations of these quantities in @xmath0 . here",
    "we would like to fill this gap by computing various quantities and extracting critical indices at both transitions . among the main quantities calculated in this paper",
    "there are binder cumulants . as rg invariant quantities ,",
    "binder cumulants are very useful in locating the critical couplings and determining the nature of the phase transition .",
    "indeed , the computation of binder cumulants proved to be very efficient in studying bkt transitions in a variety of models , like the @xmath7 model , the discrete gaussian model and the sos model  @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that these cumulants are of great value also in the investigation of phase transitions in @xmath6 @xmath1 models .",
    "preliminary results of our study have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ setup ] we describe the set - up of the monte carlo simulation and the newly developed cluster algorithm ; in section  3 we introduce the observables adopted in this work and study the transition from the high - temperature to the massless phase ; in section  4 we move on to consider the transition from the massless to the low - temperature ordered phase ; finally in section  5 we draw our conclusions . in the appendix we check the consistency of our determination of the critical couplings with the duality transformations .",
    "in this work we concentrate our attention to the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ pfzndef ] ) and  ( [ qpgen ] ) , with only one non - zero coupling , @xmath40  , but we nevertheless present all definitions and formulae for a generic @xmath2 . ] .",
    "this model is known in the literature also as @xmath2-state ferromagnetic clock model and is a discrete version of the continuous @xmath7 ( plane rotator ) model .",
    "it consists of 2d planar spins restricted to @xmath2 evenly spaced directions , with spin interaction energy proportional to their scalar product .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath41 with summation taken over nearest - neighbor sites . for @xmath42",
    "this is the ising model , whereas in the @xmath43 limit we get the @xmath7 model .",
    "here we develop a new algorithm , valid for odd @xmath2 , by which an accurate numerical study of the model can be performed for @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ the smallest @xmath2 value for which the phase structure described in the introduction holds .",
    "here are the steps of our cluster algorithm for the update of a spin configuration @xmath44 :    * choose randomly @xmath45 in the set @xmath46 * build a cluster configuration according to the following probability of bond activation between neighboring sites @xmath47 @xmath48 * `` flip '' each cluster , with probability 1/2 , by replacing all its spins according to the transformation @xmath49 which amounts to replacing each spin @xmath50 in a cluster by the spin @xmath51 for which @xmath52 ; equivalently , if the spins are mapped into the @xmath2 roots of unity in the complex plane , the above replacement means flipping the component of each spin transverse to the direction identified by @xmath45 .",
    "it is easy to prove that this cluster algorithm fulfills the detailed balance .",

    "it should be noted , however , that the population @xmath56 and its susceptibility are not suitable observables for this purpose , being defined in a non - local manner and , thus , not directly related to the two - point correlator .",
    "we use , instead , the rotated magnetization @xmath66 and its susceptibility @xmath67 and compare their values at the infinite volume critical coupling @xmath17 ( see the last two columns of table  [ beta2_pc ] ) with the scaling laws  ( [ magn_fss ] ) and  ( [ chim_fss ] ) , respectively . results for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are summarized in tables  [ chimr_second ] and [ mr_second ] .",

    "the determination of @xmath17 has been cross - checked with the infinite volume extrapolation of the ( volume dependent ) pseudocritical couplings of the second transition , assuming essential scaling .",
    "we have found the following values of the critical couplings : @xmath81 and @xmath63 . as mentioned in the introduction , values of the critical points",

    "we check , via the duality , the accuracy of our predictions and show that our determination of the critical couplings is in rather good agreement with it .",
    "the determination of the index @xmath82 at the first transition has been cross - checked with the effective @xmath15 index method .",
    "the values of the index @xmath65 at both critical points agree well with theoretical predictions obtained for the villain formulation  @xcite thus supporting the conjecture that both standard and villain formulations are in the same universality class .",
    "the behavior of the complex magnetization as well as the two - point correlation function strongly indicate that the intermediate phase is a massless phase whose symmetry is @xmath39 .",

    "in particular , two - point correlators tend to vanish at large distances for large volumes , whereas one should expect spontaneous symmetry breaking and non - vanishing values of long distance correlations in the case of second order phase transition .",
    "the exclusion of the second order transition at @xmath17 seems to be a more subtle problem , at least on the numerical side .",
    "one should probably simulate the system on larger lattices to reliably distinguish the bkt scenario from the second order one , if we deal with the quantities studied so far .",
    "however , one could consider more traditional observables to determine the order of the phase transition .",
    "the bkt phase transition is of infinite order . in particular",
    ", it is expected that the singular part of the free energy of the @xmath7 model behaves like @xmath91 .",
    "hence , all derivatives of the free energy are analytic functions of the temperature . in turn",

    ", the second order transition seems incompatible with the analysis of the dual transformations  @xcite .",
    "measured on lattices with @xmath9 ranging from 16 to 1024 . ]    as discussed in the introduction , in a recent work  @xcite it has been claimed that the phase transition at @xmath36 is not a standard bkt phase transition . the main tool in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was the helicity modulus @xmath93 , which was not considered in this work .",
    "the key observation in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the helicity modulus does not jump to zero across the phase transition .",
    "this property prompted the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to conclude that the phase transition at @xmath36 is a weaker cousin of the standard bkt transition .",
    "our data indicate that there seem to be no influence of such behavior of the helicity modulus on other characteristic features of the phase transition .",
    "most important on our opinion is the fact that both standard and villain formulation are still in the same universality class since they show equal critical indices .",
    "moreover , one could consider the critical index which governs the behavior of the helicity modulus  @xcite @xmath94 our data for the indices @xmath57 and @xmath73 are compatible with a vanishing value of @xmath95 .",
