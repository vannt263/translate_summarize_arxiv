    "measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) is a widely accepted scheme for quantum computation @xcite . instead of designing complicated quantum gates to manipulate qubits ,",
    "mbqc is implemented by executing a sequence of single - qubit measurements on cluster states consisting of a group of highly entangled qubits . as a result ,",
    "one great difficulty lies in the cluster - state preparation .",
    "there are various proposals to prepare cluster states . in optics ,",
    "people use fusion operation to bind small cluster states into a larger cluster state @xcite . in quantum dots , people also know method to do it @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , raussendorf _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out two general ways to prepare cluster states .",
    "the first one is to prepare all qubits in @xmath0 state , and entangle them into a cluster state by implementing cz gates on all neighboring sites .",
    "the second one is to design a so - called cluster hamiltonian , of which the ground state is a cluster state , and then cool down the system to obtain an approximate cluster state .",
    "the idea of cluster hamiltonian has been further explored .",
    "for example , one can encode four physical qubits into one logical qubit to achieve an experimentally realizable cluster hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the topologically protected mbqc can reduce the thermal fluctuations @xcite in the hamiltonian - created cluster state .",
    "experiments on optical systems have been performed to demonstrate various quantum algorithms and protocols using the mbqc scheme . in 2005 , walther _",
    "_ reported the demonstrative experiment on 4-qubit cluster states @xcite .",
    "in 2007 , grover s search algorithm on four qubits is performed @xcite .",
    "also , deutsch s algorithm is realized by the mbqc on a four - qubit optical system @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the same year , six - photon cluster state was successfully entangled by pan s group @xcite .",
    "the one - way mbqc scheme is even used to test the quantum version of the prisoner s dilemma @xcite .",
    "a four - photon cluster state with very high fidelity is demonstrated in ref .",
    "the realization of mbqc beyond cluster state is also reported @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , cluster states , as a highly entangled system , are fragile to decoherence .",
    "it is thus important to analysis the noise to ensure the computation on a cluster state reliable .",
    "some works have been done on this topic . in 2006 , a method is proposed to check the fidelity of a four - qubit cluster state experimentally @xcite .",
    "the entanglement sudden death phenomenon @xcite , which may affect the fidelity of cluster states , is also studied @xcite .",
    "recently , fujii _",
    "_ studied the error appeared in the hamiltonian - created cluster states when the temperature is non - zero @xcite .",
    "they discovered that the fidelity shows a sudden change at a certain threshold temperature .",
    "+    in this paper , we analyze the performance of the mbqc system when coupled with boson environment . the cluster state fidelity and four kinds of gate fidelity",
    "is measured , and the gate fidelity is studied in detail .    due to the threshold theorem of fault - tolerant quantum computation ,",
    "if the error in individual quantum gates is below a certain threshold , quantum computation in a large scale can be achieved as well @xcite . as a result",
    ", our analysis works to protect mbqc systems with arbitrary scales .",
    "boson environment has long been a concerned issue in various topics @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the boson environment , which is the noise caused by harmonic oscillators , actually describes a wide range of weak noises .",
    "thus , this noise model is generic to many quantum computation cases",
    ".    a large cluster state can be prepared bit by bit .",
    "therefore , a strategy against noise is to prepare a bit of a cluster state right before it is measured . in this paper , we assume that the cluster state for an individual gate operation is prepared at one time . with individual gate fidelities being analyzed , the fidelity of the whole mbqc can then be studied by the scheme of fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "two preparation schemes for the cluster state are evaluated .",
    "the first scheme is proposed by briegel and raussendorf @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "cluster states are prepared by entangling all qubits previously in @xmath0 state with controlled - z ( cz ) gates on neighboring sites .",
    "the second scheme is proposed by raussendorf later @xcite , where cluster states are made by cooling a system with cluster hamiltonians , of which cluster states are ground state .",
    "both preparation is significant and widely applicable .",
    "however , since the two preparation schemes are quite different , it may not be meaningful to compare the fidelity between them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ introtogf ] , we introduce gate fidelity . in sec .",
    "[ gatecreation ] , we analyze how the coupling of a boson environment affects the cluster state entangled by cz gates .",
    "we first solve the pure phase noise case exactly , and analyze this case in detail .",
    "suggestions are given to minimize the damage caused by the coupling .",
    "then , we consider both phase noise and amplitude noise , which is a more general case .",
    "we solve this problem numerically . in sec .",
    "[ hamiltoniancreation ] , we analyze the influence of a boson environment to the cluster hamiltonian situation , with both phase and amplitude noise considered we also discover a threshold coupling coefficient , at which the fidelity drops dramatically . sec .",

    "the collective character of our noise model is also discussed .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the fidelity for a cluster state @xcite is defined straightforwardly : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a perfect cluster state , and @xmath3 is the state being judged",
    ". the form and utility of a cluster state @xmath2 can be found in ref .",
    ".    however , we are often more concerned about how good a gate operation is implemented by a mbqc system , and the cluster state fidelity fails to answer the question .",
    "it is thus required to define fidelity for gate operations .",
    "a good definition employs a process called gate teleportation .",
    "the basic idea of gate teleportation is simple : if you apply some unitary operations to an epr pair and use the pair to teleport a qubit , rather than getting the original information from the transported qubit , you will receive transformed information . by applying the proper gate to the epr pair",
    ", we can get the transported qubit transformed by an desired unitary operator .",
    "for example , if you would like to have a qubit with hadamard gate applied , rather than teleporting it by a regular epr pair @xmath4 , we teleport it by @xmath5 .",
    "readers may refer to the original paper of gate teleportation @xcite to get a full understanding .",
    "it turns out that cluster state can be used to prepare the resource states for gate teleportation by implementing the one - way scheme .",
    "this fact offers a way to define gate fidelity @xcite .",
    "we take z - rotation gate for example to illustrate this process .",
    "the z - rotation operation is defined as @xmath6 and the resource state for it is @xmath7 .",
    "+    we prepare the resource state from a 5-qubit linear cluster state .",
    "the resource state is prepare by a similar measurement sequence to implement a z - rotation gate in a mbqc system .",
    "first , measure qubit 2 on the basis of pauli @xmath8 operator .",
    "the result state is @xmath9 when the out come of the measurement is @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; when the out come is @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "then , we measure qubit 3 on the basis of @xmath14 here , @xmath15 , when @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the eigenstate of this operator is @xmath17 next , measure qubit 4 on the @xmath8 basis .",
    "the result state will be @xmath18 we rewrite the state of qubits 1 and 5 as @xmath19 after correcting pauli errors , @xmath20 on qubit 5 , we get the resource state for z - rotation .",
    "we define fidelity for a gate operation as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the perfect resource state , and @xmath23 is the state we measure . from our example we know that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the measuring outcome sequence , @xmath26 is the projection operator , and @xmath27 is the error - correction operator .",
    "@xmath28 , the partial trace operation , trace out qubits other than the qubits in the resource state . back to our z - rotation resource state .",
    "@xmath26 stands for the measurement sequence on qubit 2 , 3 , and 4 , and @xmath27 stands for the correction operator @xmath29 . after the measurement and pauli - error correction ,",
    "a partial trace is taken so only qubit 1 and 5 exist in @xmath23 .",
    "if our qubit chain is in a perfect cluster state , we will have @xmath30 , so our fidelity defined above results @xmath31 in this case , coinciding with the perfect application of a z - rotation operation . as the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite points out , jamiolkowski isomorphism ensures the correctness of gate fidelity such defined .",
    "at last , it is enlightening to write the gate fidelity as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are stabilizers of @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ fidel ] ) can be further simplified for each type of gate ( see equation ( 18)-(21 ) in the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which simplifies calculation greatly .",
    "in 2001 , briegel and raussendorf proposed the first scheme to create cluster states @xcite .",
    "first , prepare all qubits in the state @xmath0 . then , entangle them by applying ising hamiltonian for a time interval , of which the accumulated effect is a controlled - z ( cz ) operation for each pair of neighboring sites . after these two steps",
    ", a cluster state is prepared .",
    "in fact , one can easily generalize this preparation : whatever applies cz operations to all neighboring sites can fulfill this scheme .    the cluster state prepared in such way would deteriorate with time .",
    "we would study the deterioration process in this section .",
    "we assume that the creation process produces a perfect cluster state .",
    "after the state is prepared , the system evolves over time and deteriorates because of coupling to a boson environment .",
    "we first limit the coupling term to pure phase noise . without the presence of amplitude noise",
    ", we can solve the time - evolution problem exactly .",
    "we take amplitude noise into consideration in sec .",
    "[ partc ] .",
    "the hamiltonian here reads    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the qubit number , @xmath37 is half of the energy gap between @xmath38 and @xmath39 state of the @xmath40th qubit , and @xmath41 is the pauli z operator of the @xmath40th qubit .",

    ". remember that if the perfect cluster state is in schrdinger picture , we of course require @xmath66 presented in schrdinger picture . rewriting the equation using the density operator in interaction picture , we have @xmath67    we plot a 7-qubit linear cluster state coupled with boson environment ( fig . [ cluster ] ) .",
    "the parameters are set to @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "there are three lines in the figure , green for @xmath71 , blue for @xmath72 , and red for @xmath73 .",
    "there are two factors contributing to the oscillation of fidelity over time : the @xmath74 function and the @xmath51 part .",
    "if the two oscillation frequencies are close , the oscillation pattern is highly unpredictable ( see the dashed blue lines ) . to any real systems , this case should be avoided .",
    "we emphasize that when the coupling does not exist , the fidelity still oscillates due to the @xmath51 part , but the peak of the oscillation is always @xmath31 .",
    "another fact is that even when the temperature of boson environment is zero , there still exists a fidelity drop at the peak .",
    "this is easy to understand , since that the coupling term still works to the system , even though all modes of boson environment is in the vacuum state .    to be more specific ,",
    "we analyze fidelity for various gate operations : @xmath75 the fidelity - time dependence for 5-qubit identity gate , 8-qubit hadamard gate , z - rotation gate and controlled - z gate are plotted in fig .",
    "[ way1 ] .",
    "+    the parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . because a medium @xmath37 will result in unpredictable time evolution pattern , this kind of fidelity curve is not presented .",
    "different gate operations show different oscillation patterns , due to their own lattice structures and sizes .",
    "[ way1 ] shows that when @xmath37 is large , all types of gates exhibit a fidelity peak uniformly at @xmath76 , which is better than @xmath73 case .",
    "this is because when @xmath37 is large , the @xmath51 renders the fidelity to oscillate rapidly , which leave the gate - type - independent @xmath74 function to shape the envelope of the fidelity .",
    "therefore , if the measurement can be implemented rapidly , a strong @xmath37 is preferred .",
    "because of the advantage listed above , we pick the green line of fig . [ way1 ] to conduct our investigation in this part . in this part , we are focused on giving suggestions to enhance the performance of mbqc realized by the cz - creation scheme .",
    "if the gate operation is implemented as soon as the cluster state is prepared , one would concern the drop rate of the fidelity on the first several fidelity peaks .",
    "we treat the fidelity drop rate as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the time for the first peak of fidelity after @xmath79 .",
    "we calculate the fidelity drop rate versus the temperature of the boson environment .",
    "our result is shown in fig .",
    "[ derivative ] .    as the figure reveals , the fidelity drop rate curves decrease as the temperature increases , but the decrease is slow and non - linear .",
    "when the environment temperature gets lower , the decrease becomes even slower .",
    "this process eventually stops at @xmath80 , where the fidelity drop rates reach at a non - zero value .",
    "utilizing this fact , we can save cooling equipments , since there is little room for the fidelity drop rates to decrease in low temperature .",
    "if a cluster state will be kept for some time before measuring it , we would ask where the fidelity peaks become high enough .",
    "this question fits the situation when a part of computation must wait until other parts finish , while the cluster state is already prepared . from fig .",
    "[ way1 ] we learn that the fidelity peaks in the first peak of the envelope ( see the set of fidelity peaks near @xmath76 ) may be qualified for our purpose . to evaluate this area ,",
    "we calculate the arriving time of the highest peak in it , and the fidelity of the highest peak .",
    "our calculation ( see fig . [ tdepend ] ) proves the qualification of this area in two aspects .",
    "first , the fidelity of the highest peak is high enough . from fig .",
    "[ tdepend ] , we see that the fidelities are all above @xmath81 when @xmath82 .",
    "we also work out the fidelity - temperature dependence at very low temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fidelityprecise ] .",
    "when temperature gets even lower , the fidelity changes no more , stoping at a value lower than @xmath31 at @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we again need not cool down the temperature with infinite effort . in our parameter setting , @xmath83 is good enough to ensure a high fidelity for the highest peak .",
    "second , the arriving time of the highest peak is almost independent of environment temperature , and completely gate - typing independent , which simplifies our utilization .",
    "the highest peak may switch from one to another among several neighboring peaks , as happens on the identity gate and the z - rotation gate in the figure , but this fact does not complicate our utilization . since several peaks near the highest peak are almost equally good and the temperature should vary little , we can just stick on one of the peaks .",
    "the fact that the highest peak arrives uniformly regardless of @xmath84 is because the oscillation is mainly controlled by @xmath74 function and @xmath51 , both of which do not depend on the environment temperature at all .",
    "the arriving time is also gate - type independent .",
    "again , it is because of the @xmath74 function , which keeps invariant under changes of gate type , qubit number , and the lattice shape of a cluster state .      until now , we only evaluated pure phase noise . in the perspective of noise theory , pure phase noise fails to describe all circumstances . as a result",
    ", we generalize our hamiltonian to consider both phase and amplitude noise in this section : @xmath85 with amplitude noise added , we can no longer solve the time evolution problem analytically .",
    "instead , we seek for numerical solutions , trying to figure out the character of the generalized noise . for simplicity , we calculate a single - mode boson environment , with the frequency resonant with the energy gap of a two - level qubit : @xmath86 this single - frequency model is reasonable , because naturally the resonant frequency mode causes more damage .",
    "the only drawback of this model is that it fails to describe the situation when @xmath87 , in which case a boson would have zero energy , which is impossible .    for cluster states consisting of several qubits ,",
    "we write a program to calculate the time evolution of the density operator : @xmath88    in the system , the boson environment is infinite dimensional . in our program , however , we adopt the cut - off approximation , setting the maximum boson number to some large number .",
    "the gate fidelity is still defined by equation ( [ originalgatefid ] ) .",
    "we show the calculation outcomes of 5-qubit identity gate , 8-qubit hadamard gate , z - rotation gate and controlled - z gate .",
    "we set @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , with different @xmath92 considered ( see fig .",
    "[ rev1 ] ) .",
    "+    fidelity curves in fig .",
    "[ rev1 ] show some common pattern .",
    "first , all angle @xmath92 results in similar oscillation patterns , with the same oscillation frequency .",
    "the reason is transparent .",
    "since the coupling is weak , we are safe to assume that the oscillation frequency is mainly governed by @xmath51 part of the hamiltonian , which stays independent against the noise type ( or equivalently , the parameter @xmath92 ) .",
    "an interesting fact is that phase noise imposes less damage than amplitude noise .",
    "according to the figure , @xmath93 cases has its peak fidelity near to @xmath31 even after a long time .",
    "this character can be understood by some qualitative reasoning .",
    "since a z error can not change the energy of the qubits while the boson environment must add or subtract its boson number by one to impose an error , the total energy of the system is changed by @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , an x error changes the energy of the qubits by @xmath94 , which compensates the energy change in the boson environment , and keeps the energy of the whole system unchanged .",
    "since x errors does not require the energy of the system to change , it occurs much easier than z errors .",
    "a cluster state can also be created by cluster hamiltonians @xcite , of which the cluster state is the ground state .",
    "the simplest cluster hamiltonian is @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are the stabilizers of the cluster state : @xmath98 the product is over all sites neighboring site @xmath99 .",
    "since the ground state @xmath100 must be a state that @xmath101 we claim that @xmath102 . therefore , cooling this system , we obtain a thermal state close to a cluster state .    to construct an appropriate model for noise , we need to study the energy level of hamiltonian ( [ hwithout ] ) .",
    "the eigenstate of @xmath103 is just the common eigenstates of all cluster stabilizers @xmath104 .",
    "the first excited state , @xmath105 , would be the eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath106 of a certain @xmath97 and the eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath31 of @xmath107 .",
    "its energy is @xmath108 higher than the ground state . following this reasoning",
    ", we conclude that the energy gap between neighboring energy levels are all @xmath108 .",
    "degeneracy of this model can also be deduced .",
    "for example , since @xmath105 can only have one eigenvalue @xmath106 , and there are @xmath40 stabilizers for a certain cluster state , we conclude that the first excited state is n - fold degenerate . applying the same method",
    ", one can calculate the degeneracy of higher excited states .",
    "we remark that the ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "now , we can construct a single - mode boson environment , with the mode frequency resonant with the gap between nearest energy levels : @xmath109 the energy level structure of this hamiltonian , with @xmath110 , is plot in fig .",

    "the gap between the nearest energy levels is also @xmath108 .",
    "the density operator for thermal state is @xmath112 again , we compute fidelity for gate operations of this density operator . in low temperature",
    ", the thermal state mainly comprises the lowest several energy levels . as a result",
    ", we again take a cut - off on boson number in our computation .    in fig .",
    "[ fujiirev_id5_3d ] and fig .",
    "[ fujiirev_har8_3d ] , we plot the fidelity of 5-qubit identity gate and 8-qubit hadamard gate as a function of temperature @xmath84 and the coupling coefficient @xmath113 . for clarity , we also present the fidelity-@xmath113 dependence for different @xmath84 in one figure , setting @xmath114 .",
    "[ fg ] .",
    "we find the hamiltonian creation scheme produces cluster states robust against boson environment , when the coupling is below a certain threshold amount , whatever it is under phase or amplitude noise .",
    "the fidelity is close to @xmath31 as long as @xmath113 and @xmath84 is below a critical coupling coefficient value , depending on gate type ( see fig .",
    "[ fg_theta ] ) .",
    "further , a small @xmath113 value do not deteriorate the fidelity even when the temperature @xmath84 is high .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fg ] , where with small @xmath113 , the curves overlap greatly .",
    "when the coupling becomes gradually stronger , a fidelity sudden drop is observed .",
    "this character is similar to the fidelity sudden change when @xmath84 goes high , which is well treated in ref .",
    "[ fg ] and fig .",
    "[ fg_theta ] shows that for 5-qubit identity gate , @xmath115 , while for 8-qubit hadamard gate , @xmath116 . below these critical coupling coefficients",
    ", the fidelity does not suffer from the coupling effect .",
    "for example , setting @xmath117 and @xmath90 , the fidelity of 5-qubit identity gate at @xmath110 , @xmath118 is @xmath119 , while at @xmath120 , @xmath118 is @xmath121 , which means fidelity only drops @xmath122 by an super strong coupling .",
    "actually , @xmath123 , known as ultra strong coupling , requires special design to achieve in experiment @xcite , would not occur in a quantum computation task . as a result",
    ", the fidelity sudden drop does not harass the gate operations evaluated here .",
    "however , in a large cluster state , this character may become an issue .",
    "since @xmath124 depends on the cluster size , it may be probable that a large cluster state has a small critical value . in this case",
    ", one must calculate the critical coefficient carefully , and restrict the coupling effect below this level in their mbqc systems .",
    "this part first analyze the difference between gate fidelity and cluster state fidelity .",
    "then , we discuss the collective character of our environment .    one may wonder why gate fidelity is different from the corresponding cluster state fidelity , as the definition is similar to one another .    the first observation to answer this question is that , to get a correct gate teleportation resource state by the procedure shown in fig .",
    "[ gatetele ] , one does not necessarily need a cluster state .",
    "again we take the z - rotation gate for example .",
    "if there are x errors on both qubit 2 and 4 , the resource state can also be correctly prepared : @xmath125 where the relationship @xmath126 holds , since the measurement of qubit 2 and 4 is under @xmath8 basis . in this section ,",
    "we denote pauli x operator as @xmath8 and z operator as @xmath127 .",
    "the same reasoning holds when the error is @xmath128 .",

    "we study four kinds of gate fidelity in detail , and propose two suggestions to enhance its performance under the coupling .    to the hamiltonian - creation scheme , the fidelity sudden change phenomenon is discovered . below a certain threshold coupling coefficient value , the damage caused by boson environment is ignorable .",
    "the threshold value depends on gate type and cluster size . for individual gates consisting of several qubits ,",
    "the threshold value is large so one will not worry about the effect caused by the coupling . we conclude that the hamiltonian - creation method is robust against this kind of noise under a threshold coupling value .",
