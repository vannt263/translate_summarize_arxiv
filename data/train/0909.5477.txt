    "oxidation and reduction processes on palladium surfaces are attracting interest , since the understanding of catalytic reactions on palladium is a key point to explore functionality of this solid catalyst working as the three - way catalyst for the automotive emissions control.@xcite when oxidation of pd proceeds , various stable pd - oxide films are created to cover the pd surface depending on the surface morphology.@xcite a stable surface structure of an oxidized pd(100 ) surface is known to be ( @xmath0)@xmath1 pdo mono - layer.@xcite formation of a pdo thin film stabilizes the pd(100 ) surface against further oxidation .",
    "interestingly , catalytic reactivity is often attributed to surface oxides.@xcite here , two questions arise .",
    "is there a process to reach oxidation of the pd substrate below the pdo film ?",
    "how high is the reactivity of the pdo film itself in a catalytic reaction process ?    in a study of co oxidation at pd(100 ) , rogal , reuter and scheffler have shown surface phase diagram in constrained thermodynamic equilibrium obtained using the first - principles statistical mechanics.@xcite they carefully constructed the phase diagram with converged slab structures with surfaces reacted with oxygen and/or co. interestingly , no coadsorption structures on pd(100 ) in equilibrium was found .",
    "but , langmuir - hinshelwood reaction processes were expected around the phase boundary between surface oxide phases and co adsorbed surfaces . in their surface phase diagram , we can see a wide stable phase of ( @xmath0)@xmath1 surface oxide structure , which was found in the experiments .    in consideration of the three - way catalysts ,",
    "co oxidation happens continually in a reactor by a gas flow .",
    "thus , one needs to consider reactivity of the catalyst in a low partial pressure of co. a key to understand total reactivity in this condition may be found in a point that , on a three - way catalyst material , other surface structures coexist with a pd surface .",
    "the phase diagram of rogal suggests that surface oxide formation without any extra adsorbents on the pd oxide film is favored in a wide pressure range . here",
    ", we may start from re - considering reactivity of surface oxides in a non - equilibrium condition with fluctuating density of surface oxygen .",
    "there , adsorbed oxygen atoms might come from a catalytic material structure other than the pdo film .",
    "since it is a hard task to treating all the possibility , we just consider a single adsorbed oxygen atom assumed to be provided by other surfaces of the catalytic material than the pdo film and test its stability and reactivity .",
    "fluctuating behavior of the surface oxygen will be called fluxionality . for this possible motion of oxygen atoms ,",
    "morphological softness is preferable . if this character is expected in nano - meter - scale pd structures , the condition to have fluxionality may be relaxed .",
    "thus , we should also search for a simulation result which might open our eyes .",
    "to study reactivity of the ( @xmath0)@xmath1 pdo film on a pd(100 ) surface , we performed the first - principles structural optimization simulations to obtain stable oxygen - adsorbed structures of the pdo thin film .",
    "slab models of pdo / pd(100 ) were used for the simulation and thus the calculation data should be interpreted as results for a thin pd structure with an oxidized surface .",
    "two stable sites were found in this study .",
    "stability of these sites depends on local atomic configuration of the whole pd - oxide structure in the simulation .",
    "choice of the structure of the thin pd substrate even relaxes conditions for possible oxygen migration .",
    "we evaluated reaction energies of reduction processes for no@xmath4 ( no , no@xmath2 , or n@xmath2o ) and a co oxidation process to estimate functionality of the pdo surface as a redox catalyst .",
    "characteristic features of the adsorbed reactive oxygen atom are explored by analyzing the local electronic density of states and barrier heights of oxygen migration .",
    "the estimated transition path of the oxygen atom reveals that there can exist fluxionality analogous to motions of fluxional function groups in molecules@xcite and clusters .",
    "finally , we will summarize our conclusions , in which an expected mechanism of the catalytic function is proposed .",
    "a generalized gradient approximation@xcite based on the density functional theory@xcite was adopted in our calculation .",
    "the calculation was done using the plane - wave expansion with the ultra - soft pseudo potentials@xcite realized in the quantum - espresso ver 3.2.3 package.@xcite conditions for the simulation were the followings . cut - off energies for the wave function and the charge density were 408ev and 2721ev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5-point sampling was done with @xmath6 mesh points in the first brillouin zone .    as a typical model structure ,",
    "we consider a slab model which consist of a pdo film on two pd layers .",
    "we call this `` the model i '' , or `` the thin model '' .",
    "this model is very thin .",
    "we will show that some characteristic properties of the pdo film on this thin pd layers are qualitatively different from those of the pdo film on the stable pd ( 100 ) surface , although its structure is only slightly different from that of the pdo on the stable pd ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "the structure of the model i gives us an interesting result on the oxygen fluxionality .",
    "we compare the result with another structure with a pdo film on up tp five pd sublayers , which we call `` the model ii '' or `` the thick model '' .",
    "the thickness of pd layers of the model ii is enough to reproduce the pdo film structure on pd(100 ) surface , since we have the converged pdo structure for 3 , 4 , or 5 pd layers as substrates .",
    "to check validity of the simulation for the model i , we performed several test simulations .",
    "a repeated slab model with a vacuum layer of 7  thickness was employed for each simulation .",
    "convergence is seen as follows : when thickness of the vacuum layer is increased from 7 to 15 , atomic positions changed slightly only with absolute error of less than @xmath7  .",
    "the total energy changes only less than @xmath8 ev for the model i.    for the structural optimization of the model ii , we prepared the pdo structure of a surface unit cell of ( @xmath0)@xmath1 above 3 , 4 , or 5 atomic layers of pd , which is a structure with up to five pd sublayers . at the start of the simulations , the size of the surface unit cell of the pdo was set so that the lattice constants of the pd sublattice is equal to the lattice constants of an equilibrium lattice of the bulk pd and kept fixed in each optimization calculations .",
    "all of the relative atomic positions are relaxed in each simulations .",
    "the optimized structures reproduce the former result@xcite qualitatively and almost quantitatively ( see table[str_param ] and also discussion in the final paragraph of the section[surface_migration ] ) .",
    "however , when we look at the model i , the pdo film showed a little modified structure from that of the model ii .",
    "for the comparison , we summarize the optimized structural parameters of the models i and ii in table [ str_param ] .",
    "we note here that the distance between pd layers are : @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the model i and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for the mode ii , where @xmath16 with @xmath17 represents the @xmath18th pd sublayer which consists up to 5 substrate layers .",
    "the structure shown in figure [ pdo - structure - i ] is an optimized structure of the model i , which was obtained by the structural optimization , in which the inter atomic forces were reduced to less than @xmath19[ev / a.u . ] . in the optimized film structure , 4-fold - coordinated sites and 2-fold - coordinated sites of pd",

    "this problem needs rather detailed simulations . to test functionality of the oxygen adsorbed oxide film as a catalyst ,",
    "however , we can confirm reactivity of the adsorbed oxygen atom .",

    "seven replicas for the model i and eight replicas for the model ii were prepared and the paths were optimized .",
    "some snapshots in between these stable sites are shown in figure[path_bridge_hollow ] .    the barrier height for this transition of the model",

    "optimization of atomic configuration of the pdo film is important to have this value .",
    "gradual modification of the pdo structure is seen in the panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure[path_bridge_hollow ] . in this transition ,",
    "the adsorbed oxygen keeps a bond connection with a 2-fold - coordinated pd atom in the pdo film .",
    "we can interpret that a rotational motion of the extra oxygen atom around a o - pd - o structure occurs at the 2-fold - coordinated pd site in pdo film .",
    "thus , the existence of low - coordinated pd atoms is a key to understand possible fluxionality of the adsorbed oxygen .",
    "we determined the first barrier of 0.45ev for the possible total transition from a stable bridge - site ( i ) structure to another bridge - site ( i ) structure in the model i. we have another barrier from the bridge site ( ii ) structure of figure[path_bridge_hollow](d ) to another bridge site ( i ) .",
    "however , it is much smaller than the above barrier , since the next bridge - site ( i ) structure is easily accessible from the bridge - site ( ii ) structure .",
    "there might be a direct path from a bridge site ( i ) to another bridge site ( i ) , but the barrier height should be a little higher than the above value .",
    "thus , we assume that a typical barrier height is around 0.45ev for the migration of oxygen atoms on pdo of the thin model ( see figure [ transition_path ] ) .",
    "a simulation for the model ii tells us another picture .",
    "we performed a nebm simulation from the bridge - site ( i ) structure to another neighboring bridge - site ( i ) structure using the model ii . in this simulation , the barrier height is found to be @xmath27ev .",
    "there appear no bridge - site ( ii ) structure in this process .",
    "in addition , we found that the local structure of the substrate was almost kept rigid in the reaction path , although all of atoms were allowed to move .",
    "this rigidity prevents modification of the pdo film .",
    "if continual bond formations between the adsorbed oxygen and pd atoms on the path appear , the height of the energy barrier decreases .",
    "but , in this model ii , the energy reduction hardly occurs . on the contrary ,",
    "easiness in morphological change in the structure allows easy fluxionality of oxygen in the model i. thus , we conclude that the fluxionality may be attributed to a nano - meter - scale thin oxidized pd structure .",
    "the value of 0.45ev for the barrier is rather small .",
    "if we refer to values in table [ reaction_energy ] , we can expect a large kinetic energy of the adsorbed oxygen atoms coming from the reaction heat of no@xmath4 reduction .",
    "the oxygen atoms will move approximately with motional energy of typically @xmath28 1ev .",
    "thus , the mobility of oxygen atoms would be easily kept in the whole process .    here , we should note that known pdo films on various pd surfaces always have 2-fold - coordinated sites as well as pdo@xmath29 units.@xcite we can thus hope to have similar migration paths of oxygen around the 2-fold - coordinated pd atoms . here , the bond angle of a structure o - pd - o shows notable difference between the model i and the model ii . in the model i , the o - pd - o angles are 135@xmath30 and 160@xmath30 , while the values increase and become 162@xmath30 and 169@xmath30 in the model ii .",
    "the latter values are approximately equal to 170@xmath30 found in the literature.@xcite the bond angle itself does not directly reflect the migration barrier .",
    "however , small angles in o - pd - o happen only for the model i , where relaxation in the pdo film structure is easily achieved .",
    "thus the value of the migration barrier should reflect this structural feature , _",
    "i.e. _ easy structural modification .",
    "once the fluxionality of reactive oxygen is guaranteed owing to this feature , we will have an enhanced cross section for co oxidization process .",
    "but , we should note again that the structural feature of the model i is lost already for a slab model with 3 or more pd layers in the substrate .",

    "we have obtained two stable structures for oxygen - adsorbed pdo film over a pd(100 ) thin structure .",
    "existence of both 2-fold - coordinated pd atoms and 4-fold - coordinated pd atoms is important to have fluxionality of oxygen atoms at stable bridge sites ( i ) .",
    "the oxygen atom moves around a 2-fold - coordinated pd atom , which is a characteristic feature of the pdo films . on a pdo film formed on a substrate of two pd layers ,",
    "the oxygen atom may reach at a bridge site ( ii ) . in this case",
    ", the migration barrier may be reduced to @xmath3ev .",
    "because half of pd atoms in the pdo film are 2-fold - coordinated and can provide adsorption sites for the activated oxygen atoms , the fluxionality of oxygen can happen on the whole pdo film structure .",
    "because of enhancement in the reactivity estimated by ldos and fluxionality in migration paths as well as the exothermic nature in a continual reaction of co oxidation and n@xmath4o reduction , we conclude that the continual redox reactions may occur through motion and reaction of active oxygen atoms on the stable pdo film .",
    "now , we have a well - defined picture of catalytic reactions of the pdo surfaces with the 2-fold - coordinated pd atom surrounded by two oxygen atoms . here",
    ", we should note that the local structure of this o - pd - o bond connections is similar to those found in pd catalysts@xcite utilized for the c - c cross - coupling reactions of the suzuki - miyaura coupling,@xcite where ligands might be phosphine or arsine , rather than oxides .",
    "we can expect that the o - pd - o structure is reactive also for the hydro - carbon structures as in the homogenous catalysts . since the redox reactivity for no@xmath4 and co mixture is energetically confirmed as above , we can also expect to have a finite reactivity for the heterogeneous catalysts even in a three - way catalytic reaction .",
    "when we notice that the above mechanism found in the pdo film can be a general one , we have an idea to find similar reactive surface in oxide films .",
    "oxide films with low coordinated metal atoms in an oxide structure provide fluxionality of the adsorbed oxygen atoms as found in the pdo film .",
    "especially , 2-fold - coordinated metal atoms can have important roles .",
    "if an attached extra oxygen atom rotates around the 2-fold - coordinated metal , the oxygen can easily move around on the film by passing from a stable oxygen state to the others .",
    "when a co molecule in the gas phase collides with the adsorbed oxygen atom in the highly reactive state , the reaction in the er scheme happens .",
    "if the oxygen is in a fluxional state , reaction rates are inevitably increased , because the cross section of the collision should be enhanced .",
    "the er scheme is unlikely to be sensitive to the surface temperature , which would be requested for a solid catalyst effective in a wide temperature range .    for a continual reaction , to keep the low - coordination of metal atoms in surface oxides is thus the key factor . in order to have this functionality ,",
    "next conditions may be requested for a catalytic oxide .",
    "1 .   existence of fluxionality for oxygen motion around a low - coordinated metal atom .",
    "2 .   prevention of highly oxidized state at catalytic sites to keep the low coordination .",
    "3 .   prevention of over - reduction at catalytic sites to keep the oxide structure .",
    "4 .   existence of a buffer for oxygen atoms in the catalyst or in the environment .",
    "the first point ensures high reactivity of the co reduction process .",
    "it also relates to reactivity of no@xmath4 reduction , since mobility of extra oxygen allows the catalyst also to keep a reaction rate of no@xmath4 reduction .",
    "the second point is required to keep the reaction site active .",
    "this factor might be much easily achieved , if we have another metal species which is much easily oxidized , and if the species form a buffer of oxygen atoms inside a catalytic structure .",
    "the third factor is important to prevent an aging effect , where so - called agglomeration of metal particles kills the redox functionality .    to preserve the reactive property",
    ", the oxygen buffer would be effective",
    ". the buffer may be a part of the whole catalyst structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the substrate .",
    "it should be less reductive than pd , since oxygen atoms should be kept in the buffer under the over - reduction environment .",
    "for this purpose , a pure metal substrate is less effective .",
    "existence of rare - earth elements in an oxide structure , for example , would be important for this function .",
    "thus realization of the low - coordinated oxide film structures even in another bulk oxide structure can be the final answer for a highly reactive redox catalyst .",
    "the oxide support is actually often used in real three - way catalyst . if we look at the functionality of the perovskite catalyst,@xcite",
