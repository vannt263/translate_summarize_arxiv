    "several liquids exhibit anomalous behaviours , i.e. behaviours that differ from what is expected for normal liquids such as argon .",
    "water is the most common example of such systems .",
    "for example , while normal liquids contract when they are cooled , water expands under @xmath2 at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "however , water is not unique in this respect .",
    "the anomlaous behavior in density , in fact , has been observed also in experimets for @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite and simulations for silica @xcite , silicon @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "all these systems , including water , present a temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) below which density decreases when temperature is lowered at constant pressure .    nevertheless , liquid water is anomalous also in other properties ; for example , in its dynamics and its structure .",
    "while the diffuson coefficient @xmath9 of a normal liquid decreases as density or pressure are increased , water is characterized by a region of the phase diagram where @xmath9 increases when the pressure is increased .",
    "experiments show that the normal behaviour is restored at pressures higher than @xmath10 kbar at @xmath11 @xcite .    regarding the structure , normal liquids tend to become more structurated when compressed .",
    "this can be quantified by two order parameters : a translational order parameter @xmath12 , quantifying the tendency of pairs of molecules to adopt preferential separations , and an orientational order parameter @xmath13 that measures the tendency of a molecule and its nearest neigbhours to assume a specific local arrangement , as considered by steinhardt et al .",
    "for a normal liquid @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase with pressure .",
    "water , instead , shows a region where the structural order parameters decrease for increasing pressure or density at constant @xmath14 , i.e. the system becomes more disordered , as shown by errington and debendetti with molecular dynamics simualtions @xcite .",
    "also simualtions for a model of silica display similar anomalies , as shown by shell et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sequence of the anomalies in water is well determined in experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite . for",
    "the @xmath0 phase diagram the water structural anomaly region is encompassing the diffusion anomaly region which includes the density anomaly region .    despite",
    "the fact that these anomalies can be found also in other liquids the sequence of anomalies may be different or may be the same .",
    "it is different , for example , for silica where the anomalous difussion region contains the structural anomaly regions that , in turn , includes the density anomaly region @xcite .",
    "the sequence of anomalies is , instead , the same for several isotropic models @xcite .",
    "isotropic models are systems of identical particles interacting through a central potential .",
    "it has been shown that isotropic potentials with a repulsive soft - core , either a ramp or a shoulder , have anomalies that resemble those of water @xcite .    here",
    "we consider one of these potentials showing anomalies : the continous shoudered well potential ( csw ) , introduced in @xcite and studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "this model can be considered as the continuous version of the discontinuous shouldered well potential ( dsw ) studied in @xcite .",
    "the two potentials have been shown to share the same qualitative phase diagram , with a liquid - iquid critical point in the supercooled liquid phase . however , while the csw has anomalies , the dsw has not .",
    "the aim of the present study is to understand the origin of this difference . in particular , we tune the csw potential in such a way to approximate , at least around the repulsive shoulder , the dsw , changing in this way the softness of the potential .",
    "our results show that the continuous tuning of the csw induces a continuous change on the regions of density and diffusion anomaly , but not a relevant effect on the structural anomaly region .",
    "when the csw approches the limit of the dsw , the regions of density and diffusion anomaly shrink as they would disappear .",

    "2 and give details about the simulations in sec 3 . in sec 4",
    "we present our results about the phase diagram , and in sec 5 our results about the anomalies , first with a criteria based on the excess entropy and then with a direct calculation . in sec 6",
    "we discuss the results , we generalize some proposed criteria and we study the effect of the long - range order . in sec 7 we give our conclusions .",
