    "recently , interest in the statistical and dynamical features of human social behavior has been growing , enabled by the development of new devices that allow tracking of social data in real time , with increasing precision and duration  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable recent finding from the analysis of spatiotemporal data on cell - phone locations is that human mobility patterns are highly predictable  @xcite , a finding that is in contrast to the traditional view .",
    "for instance , in epidemic models that take the mobility of subjects into account , subjects are usually assumed to perform a conventional random walk from one location to another  @xcite .",
    "however , actual traveling patterns of humans often deviate from such random walk models , and the displacement distribution follows a power law  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistics of the next location of the individual is affected not only by the current location , but also by the history of the traveling pattern , resulting in approximately 90% predictability of the mobility patterns  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we address a similar predictability question for a different component of human social behavior : conversation events .",
    "conversation events mediate the spreading and routing of diverse contents such as new ideas , opinions , and infectious diseases in social networks  @xcite . in models describing these phenomena , it is a norm that each individual possesses a dynamically changing state ( _ e.g. _ , opinion a or opinion b in opinion dynamics , and susceptible or infected state in epidemic dynamics ) . the law of transition from one state to another is usually assumed to be markovian , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent of the history of the process .",
    "the markovian property , which is a type of unpredictability , is an assumption for simulating such dynamics based on a static social network  @xcite .",
    "however , the plausibility of this assumption is unclear .",
    "imagine the office that you share with other colleagues in your company .",
    "when you have a question about a project , you may talk to your boss .",
    "after this conversation event , you may tend to talk to a particular individual to communicate the instruction of the boss . during lunchtime , you may chat with your close colleagues in a particular order that you do not perceive .",
    "how predictable is your choice of your next conversation partner given the current partner ?",
    "we examine the predictability of conversation events using two sets of longitudinal data collected from company offices in japan .",
    "we use the information about the timing and duration of conversations between each pair of individuals , but do not use _ a priori _ knowledge about status or other social attributes of individuals .",
    "our data are unique in that they are collected from a relatively high number of individuals ( _ i.e. _ , approximately 200 individuals ) over a long recording period ( _ i.e. _ , approximately three months ) .",
    "we examine the sequence of conversation events for each individual .",
    "we find that a conversation event has notable deterministic components .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty about the next partner that you talk with decreases by @xmath0 on average , given the identity of the partner you are currently talking with ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : predictability of partner sequences ] ) .    it should be noted that our approach is related to , but different from , the studies of power - law interval distributions in conversation events .",
    "the interval between successive conversation events for an individual or a given pair of individuals often follows a power law  @xcite .",
    "modeling studies have revealed implications of these empirical results in contagions  @xcite and opinion formation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional models in which the poisson interval distribution is assumed , these results indicate that the next conversation time given the previous one is relatively predictable in that a conversation event in the recent past is a precursor to a burst of events in the near future .",
    "we argue that the bursty nature of the point process largely contributes to the predictability of conversation events .",
    "we also show that the degree of predictability depends on individuals .",
    "individuals located inside a network community , _",
    "i.e. _ , a dense subnetwork loosely connected to other parts of the entire network  @xcite , quantified in this study via strong links and the clustering coefficient , behave relatively randomly .",
    "on the other hand , individuals that connect different communities by weak links tend to have a high predictability .",
    "we analyze two sets of face - to - face interaction logs obtained from different company offices using the business microscope system developed by hitachi , ltd .",
    ", japan  @xcite .",
    "the data were collected by world signal center , hitachi , ltd .",
    "data set @xmath1 consists of recordings from @xmath2 individuals for 73 days .",
    "data set @xmath3 consists of recordings from @xmath4 individuals for 120 days .",
    "each subject wears a name tag strapped around the neck and placed at the chest , and each name tag contains an infrared module .",
    "the infrared modules can communicate with each other if they are less than 3 meters apart .",
    "an infrared module only senses the modules situated within a @xmath5 circular sector in front of the name tag , and the system detects conversation events only when two individuals are facing each other .",
    "communication between modules includes exchanging the owners ids every 10 sec .",
    "we regard two individuals to be involved in a conversation event if their infrared modules communicate with each other at least once in 1 min . in other words ,",
    "the time resolution of the system is equal to one minute .",
    "the list of conversation partners and time stamps is stored in the name tag of each individual and sent to the central database on a daily basis .",
    "the data transfer occurs when the individual leaves work and puts the name tag on a gateway device connected to the individual s computer  @xcite .",
    "each data set contains a list of conversation events , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence - generation ] .",
    "a conversation event is specified by the ids of the two individuals talking with each other , the date and time at which the dialogue starts , and the duration of the dialogue .",
    "we are not concerned with the content of the dialogue .",
    "data sets @xmath1 and @xmath3 contain @xmath6 and @xmath7 events , respectively .",
    "we investigate the predictability of each individual s conversation patterns .",
    "our preliminary data analysis revealed that the timing of conversation events lacks sufficient temporal correlation and is unpredictable .",
    "therefore , we neglect the timing of conversation events in the data unless otherwise stated and focus on the partner sequence defined as follows . to generate the partner sequence of individual  1 , we first sift out all the conversation events that involve individual  1 from the entire data set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence - generation](b ) ) .",
    "next , we ignore the time stamp and duration of the conversation events .",

    ", we determine their order at random .    to evaluate the predictability of the partner sequence , we calculate three entropy measures , inspired by those used for the analysis of human mobility patterns  @xcite .",
    "first , we define the random entropy for individual  @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the number of @xmath8 s partners for the entire recording .",
    "if @xmath8 chooses the partner with equal probability @xmath11 from all the @xmath8 s acquaintances in each conversation event , @xmath12 quantifies the degree of randomness .",
    "second , we define the uncorrelated entropy as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the set of @xmath8 s partners containing @xmath10 elements . @xmath15 represents the probability that individual  @xmath8 talks with individual  @xmath16 in a conversation event for @xmath8 ; the normalization is given by @xmath17 .",
    "compared to @xmath12 , @xmath18 accounts for the heterogeneity among @xmath15  @xmath19 .",
    "third , we define the conditional entropy as @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the conditional probability that individual  @xmath8 talks with individual  @xmath22 immediately after talking with individual  @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath23 measures the second - order correlation in the partner sequence of @xmath8 . for each individual , @xmath24 is satisfied .",
    "we quantify the predictability of the partner sequence by the mutual information as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the joint probability that individual  @xmath8 talks with individual  @xmath22 immediately after talking with individual  @xmath16 . for each individual , @xmath27 is satisfied .",
    "@xmath28 quantifies the predictability of the partner sequence ; it is equal to the amount of the information about the next partner that is earned by knowing the current partner . when the partner sequence lacks a second - order correlation such that @xmath29 , @xmath28 takes the minimum value  @xmath30 . in this case , knowing the current partner does not help predict the next partner at all . when the partner sequence is completely deterministic , _",
    "i.e. _ , the next partner is completely predicted from the current partner such that @xmath31 , @xmath28 takes the maximum value @xmath18 .",
    "although our primary interest in this study is the temporal properties of partner sequences , we also analyze the conversation networks ( cns ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 constructed by aggregating all the conversation events in @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively , over the entire recording . in a cn",
    ", the node represents an individual , and the weight of the link , denoted as @xmath34 , represents the number of conversation events between individuals  @xmath8 and @xmath16 during the entire recording period . by the definition of the conversation event",

    "the pearson assortativity coefficient  @xcite of the degree of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is equal to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the cns have typical properties of social networks  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , high clustering and positive assortativity .",
    "for the two cns , we measure the distributions of degree , node strength , and link weight .",
    "the node strength @xmath42 is the sum of link weights connecting to node  @xmath8  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the total number of conversation events for individual  @xmath8 , defined as @xmath43 the mean and standard deviation of @xmath10 of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45  ( mean @xmath46 standard deviation ) , respectively . because two individuals are adjacent if there is at least one conversation event for a few months , the mean @xmath10 of both networks is relatively large .",
    "@xmath42 of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is equal to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",

    "the cumulative distribution of the three quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statdist_cn ] .",
    "we examine the predictability of partner sequences using the entropy measures .",
    "because the estimation of entropy is notoriously biased when the data size is small , we discard individuals with less than 100 conversation events ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath51 ) .",
    "there remain 146 and 210 individuals in data sets @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively after the thresholding . because the results for the two datasets are similar , we report the results for @xmath1 in the following .",
    "the results for @xmath3 are given in appendix  a.    the histograms of the three types of entropies for partner sequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_h](a ) .",
    "for all the individuals , @xmath18 is at least @xmath52 smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that individuals exhibit a preference when selecting partners from their neighbors in the cn .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for each individual are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_h](b ) .",
    "the mutual information @xmath56 is positive for all the individuals regardless of the value of @xmath54 .",
    "in general , the finite size effect decreases @xmath18 and @xmath23 by different amounts such that the estimated @xmath28 is generally inherited with a positive bias  @xcite . for our data , the positive values of @xmath28",
    "are not an artifact caused by the small data size . through a bootstrap test ( see appendix  b for details ) , we confirmed that the empirical values of @xmath28 are significantly ( at @xmath57 level ) larger than the values obtained from the bootstrap samples . in short ,",
    "the bootstrap samples are randomized partner sequences that destroy temporal correlation in the data but preserve the original @xmath54 and account for the portion of @xmath28 derived from the finite size effect .",
    "it should also be noted that we determined the order of partners at random when conversation events with different partners initiate in the same minute .",
    "this randomization does not make @xmath28 larger because it conserves @xmath54 and makes @xmath55 larger than the true value .",
    "in fact , the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath28 and the fraction of such overlapping conversation events for individual  @xmath8  ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) is slightly negative  ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath60 ) . in summary",
    ", the information about the current conversation partner gives the information about the next partner ; @xmath55 is , on average , @xmath0 smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "the predictability present in the data is mainly explained by the bursty activity patterns , _",
    "i.e. _ , long - tailed distributions of the interevent intervals , that have been observed for various data  @xcite .",
    "our data also possess this feature ( see appendix  c for details ) .",
    "because the interevent interval for a given pair of individuals obeys a long - tailed distribution , individual  @xmath8 tends to talk with individual  @xmath16 again within a short period from their previous conversation . in the remainder of this section , we show that the predictability is mainly caused by the bursty activity patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iei - setest](a ) ) and that predictability also exists in the data even if we omit the bursts from the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iei - setest](b ) ) .",
    "we examine the contribution of the bursty activity pattern to the predictability by calculating the mutual information  @xmath61 of the randomized partner sequence .",
    "the randomization of the interevent intervals between each pair of individuals is realized by swapping interevent intervals of the original data within each day in a completely random order ( see appendix  d for the precise methods ) .",
    "because of the computational cost of the randomization procedure , we obtain the mean and standard deviation of @xmath61 from 100 randomized partner sequences , instead of estimating the confidential interval of @xmath61 .",
    "the mean @xmath61 accounts for @xmath62 of the original @xmath28 on average  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iei - setest](a ) ) . because the randomization procedure preserves the interevent interval distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig : iei - setest](a ) suggests that a large @xmath28 is mainly attributed to the bursty activity patterns .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath61 is large partly because the randomizing procedure conserves the timings of the first and last conversation events of each pair on any day .",
    "therefore , we may be overestimating the contribution of burstiness to @xmath28 .",
    "the predictability is not solely determined by the bursty activity patterns . to clarify this point",
    ", we calculate the mutual information  @xmath63 of the modified partner sequence generated by merging the consecutive conversation events with the same partner in the original partner sequence into one event .",
    "this merging procedure allows us to eliminate the contribution of the bursty activity pattern to the predictability .",
    "for example , if individual  @xmath8 talks with individual  @xmath16 3 times without being interrupted by other partners , we merge the three conversation events into one .",
    "the values of @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iei - setest](b ) . to confirm that the positive values of @xmath63 are not an artifact caused by the small data size , we carry out a bootstrap test for @xmath63 similar to that for @xmath28 . by definition ,",
    "no partner i d appears successively in the merged partner sequence .",
    "therefore , we generate the bootstrap sample of the merged partner sequence by sampling from the merged sequence with replacement under the condition that the same partner is not consecutively chosen  ( see appendix  d for details )",
    ". @xmath63 is significantly larger than the values obtained from the bootstrap samples .",
    "therefore , the original partner sequence possesses some predictability even after removing bursts originating from the bursty nature .",
    "the predictability , quantified by @xmath28 , depends on individuals . in this section",
    ", we investigate the relationship between the predictability of individuals and the properties of nodes in the cn .",
    "the results shown in this section are summarized as follows .",
    "first , @xmath28 is negatively correlated with node strength @xmath42 and with mean node weight defined as @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_mi ] ) .",
    "second , the cn possesses the `` strength of weak ties '' structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap_mi.cc](a ) ) .",
    "third , the individuals bridging different communities with weak links tend to have large @xmath28 , and those concealed in a single community and surrounded by strong links tend to have small @xmath28 ( fig .  [ fig : overlap_mi.cc](b ) ) .",

    "[ fig : corr_mi](a ) .",
    "we found that @xmath28 is negatively correlated with @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_mi](b ) ) and with @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_mi](c ) ) . using the bootstrap test",
    ", we verified that the negative correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_mi](b ) and [ fig : corr_mi](c ) is not because of the finite sampling size  ( see appendix  b for details ) . the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_mi ] and the following results do not qualitatively change if we use the normalized mutual information  @xcite @xmath67  ( see appendix  e ) .",
    "we also verified that alternatively defining the link weight by the total duration of the conversation events for each pair , instead of the total number of the conversation events , does not qualitatively change the results described in this section ( see appendix f for details ) .    for a fixed @xmath10 , both @xmath42 and @xmath66 decrease with the number of weak links ( _ i.e. _ , the links with small weight ) connected to individual  @xmath8 .",
    "this fact leads us to hypothesize that individuals surrounded by weak links select partners in a relatively deterministic order . according to granovetter s theory of the strength of weak ties ,",
    "weak links tend to interconnect different communities in a social network and bring valuable external information to both end nodes , while strong links tend to be intracommunity links  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the individuals bridging different communities with weak links may have large values of @xmath28 .",
    "we first verify the strength of weak ties hypothesis in the cn .",
    "the network visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_00 ] appears to be consistent with the hypothesis ; weak links tend to connect communities composed of strong links .",
    "to quantify the extent to which a link is engaged in intracommunity connection , we measure the relative neighborhood overlap of a link  @xcite , defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the number of elements in the set .",
    "when @xmath70 , individuals @xmath8 and @xmath16 do not have a common neighbor and the link  @xmath71 is considered to connect different communities .",
    "when @xmath72 , individuals @xmath8 and @xmath16 share all of the neighbors and the link  @xmath71 is confined in a community .",
    "the strength of weak ties hypothesis suggests that @xmath73 is positively correlated with @xmath34  @xcite . in fig .",

    "then , the single conversation event is split into two spurious conversation events , each lasting for two minutes . to examine the robustness of our results against such observation failures , we repeat the same set of analyses after filling short intervals between successive conversations between the same pair of individuals .",
    "if individual  @xmath8 has two successive conversation events with individual  @xmath16 and the interval between the two events is smaller than or equal to @xmath87 minutes , we merge the two events into one .",

    "this is because the fraction of long interevent intervals , _",
    "i.e. _ , those over five hours , for example , is relatively small , occupying 4.31% in @xmath1 and 2.95% in @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , there is no particular reason to believe that the last conversation partner in a day and the first partner in the next day are specifically correlated . in this study",

    "the degree of predictability depends on individuals .",
    "in particular , we have shown that individuals connecting different communities in conversation networks behave relatively deterministically .",
    "we quantified the degree to which an individual is confined in communities by the clustering coefficient . in the context of an overlapping community structure ,",
    "individuals connect different communities when they belong to multiple overlapping communities  @xcite . such individuals tend to be surrounded by many triangles if we define the community by 3-cliques ( _ i.e. _ , triangles ) .",
    "this apparently contradicts our results .",
    "this contradiction comes from the difference in what we mean by connecting different communities .",

    "links bridging different communities have large betweenness centrality values  @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a node tends to decease with the betweenness centrality  @xcite .",

    "we do not have an access to the contents of dialogs for ethical reasons .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the reason for the correlation between the individual s position and predictability is limited .",
    "nevertheless , individuals that own many weak links and connect distinct groups may mediate information flows necessary to coordinate tasks involving these groups ( _ e.g. _ , project groups in a company ) .",
    "such individuals may control the information flow between the groups in a rigid manner to yield a large @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , individuals with few weak links may enjoy casual ( and perhaps creative ) conversations within their own groups to choose the partners in a random manner .",
    "such individuals may tend to have a small @xmath28 .",

    "human activity patterns are characterized by long - tailed distributions of the interevent intervals  @xcite , a feature that is shared by our data .",
    "we define the interevent interval  @xmath94 as the interval between the initiation time of two successive conversation events involving a given individual .",

    "a possible mechanism governing the predictability of the conversation events is the bursty activity patterns . to examine the effect of the long - tailed behavior of @xmath95 on the predictability ,",
    "we carry out a statistical test based on the shuffling of @xmath28 as follows .",

    "we carry out the same randomization for each day and each partner  @xmath16 .",
    "then , we combine the randomized sequences ( _ i.e. _ , point processes ) for different @xmath16 s into the one point process from which we read out the randomized partner sequence for @xmath8 . we define @xmath61 as the mutual information for this randomized partner sequence . in fig .  [",

    "the empirical values of @xmath28  ( circles ) are significantly larger than @xmath61 for most individuals .",
    "however , @xmath61 consistently occupies a large fraction of @xmath28 and increases with @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the burstiness is a major cause of the predictability regardless of the value of @xmath28 .",
    "the burstiness is not the only contributor to the predictability . to show this",
    ", we examine the reduced partner sequence generated by merging all the consecutive events with the same partner into one event .",

    "@xmath63 measures the predictability of conversation events that does not result from the burstiness .",
    "we do not directly compare @xmath63 with the original @xmath28 because the merging procedure shortens the length of the partner sequence and the amount of mutual information generally depends on the length of a sequence  @xcite .",
    "instead , we carry out a bootstrap test for @xmath63 . by definition ,",
    "the partner changes every time in the merged partner sequence .",
    "we obtain bootstrap samples respecting this property as follows .",
    "the frequency with which partner  @xmath16 appears in the merged partner sequence of individual  @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath101 .",

    "<S> we examine the predictability of conversation events for each individual using the longitudinal data of face - to - face interactions collected from two company offices in japan . </S>",
    "<S> each subject wears a name tag equipped with an infrared sensor node , and conversation events are marked when signals are exchanged between sensor nodes in close proximity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conversation events are predictable to a certain extent ; knowing the current partner decreases the uncertainty about the next partner by @xmath0 on average . </S>",
    "<S> much of the predictability is explained by long - tailed distributions of interevent intervals . </S>",
    "<S> however , a predictability also exists in the data , apart from the contribution of their long - tailed nature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an individual s predictability is correlated with the position of the individual in the static social network derived from the data . </S>",
    "<S> individuals confined in a community  in the sense of an abundance of surrounding triangles  tend to have low predictability , and those bridging different communities tend to have high predictability . </S>"
