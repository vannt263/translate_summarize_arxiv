    "transition state theory ( tst ) is one of the most important tools for analysing chemical reactions qualitatively as well as quantitatively and has also applications remote from its origin , e.g. in atomic and semiconductor physics @xcite , the study of clusters @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "fundamental to all these calculations is a classical hamilton function @xmath0 given in phase space coordinates @xmath1 which is either an inherent part of the underlying model or , e.g. for chemical reactions , given by an ab initio calculated potential energy surface @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper and the following @xcite",
    ", we apply tst to wave packets , which are widely used for variational approaches to quantum mechanical systems , such as bose - einstein condensates @xcite . here , the schrdinger or gross - pitaevskii equation is solved within the hilbert subspace of the variational parameters , and to describe the dynamics of the wave function , one makes use of a time - dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) .    in order to apply tst to a system with a known hamilton function ,",
    "one transforms the latter to its normal form using canonical transformations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for the application of tst to wave packets , where such a hamiltonian is _ not _ known , we demonstrate a method to locally map the variational parameters to action variables in classical phase space using non - canonical transformations .",
    "this step is performed by a normal form expansion @xcite of the equations of motion derived from the tdvp and the corresponding transformation of the energy functional .",
    "after having expanded the equations of motion into normal form , they are integrated to a common hamilton function and an additional transformation guarantees its equivalence to the energy functional , which at the end serves as the classical hamiltonian .    to demonstrate the procedure",
    ", we apply this method to calculating the decay rate of a frozen gaussian wave function located at the metastable ground state of a cubic model potential and compare it with the ones resulting from ordinary classical and quantum normal forms @xcite of the corresponding point particle . for the application to bose - einstein condensates with _ coupled _ gaussian wave functions ,",
    "we refer the reader to reference @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : first , we give a brief review of the classical and quantum normal form expansions , which can be applied to a given hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "then , we introduce the variational approach , demonstrate the general concept of mapping the variational parameters to classical phase space and illustrate the calculation of the respective thermal decay rates . at the end , we apply the three methods to the model potential and compare their results .",
    "we begin by summarizing the classical and quantum normal form transformation of a given hamilton function @xmath3 in the vicinity of an equilibrium point @xmath4 .",
    "since this is a well known theory , we will only give an overview of the main aspects and refer the reader to waalkens  @xcite and references therein for details .    in order to obtain the normal form hamiltonian ,",
    "one expands the hamilton function into its power series around the fixed point @xmath4 , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 summarizes monomials which are homogeneous of degree @xmath7 , and for simplicity , we omit the dependency of the phase space variables @xmath1 from now on .",
    "after having shifted the fixed point to the origin and having applied a symplectic transformation which `` simplifies '' the quadratic part @xmath8 in a way that diagonalizes the corresponding hamiltonian equations of motions , the hamilton function is in classical normal form with respect to the quadratic part .",
    "the aim is to transform the whole hamilton function @xmath9 into normal form , which is defined by the condition @xcite @xmath10 and where the adjoint operator @xmath11 is defined by the poisson bracket .    to transform the higher order terms @xmath12",

    "the classical normal form @xmath18 of the hamiltonian can easily be obtained from equation by setting @xmath29 .",
    "we now focus on the system from a different point of view and describe it quantum mechanically via its wave function @xmath30 .",
    "its physical properties are given by the hamilton operator @xmath31 and the time evolution of the wave function is determined by the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath32 where we set @xmath33 from now on .    in the following",
    ", we will approach the system in the framework of a variational ansatz @xmath34 for the wave function in the form of a wave packet . here",
    "@xmath35 is a set of @xmath36 complex and time - dependent variational parameters and the time evolution of the wave function is fully determined by that of the parameters .",
    "a usual way of treating such a variational ansatz is by means of a variational principle @xcite applied to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "however , we will also discuss it from the perspective of field theory with the hamiltonian density @xmath37 .",
    "although the latter approach will give exactly the same equations of motion for the variational parameters and the same energy functional , it allows for a better insight into the `` hamiltonian relation '' between those two , and is the basic foundation of the variational approach and the subsequently performed normal form expansion .",
    "an approximate solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation within the parameter subspace of the wave function is given by the mclachlan variational principle @xcite @xmath38 where the quantity @xmath39 is minimized with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath41 is set afterwards .",
    "for the parametrized wave function the application of the tdvp results in a set of first - order differential equations @xcite @xmath42 which determines the time evolution of the variational parameters , and where the matrix @xmath43 and the vector @xmath44 are defined by ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46the energy of the system , which is given by the expectation value @xmath47 is also a function of the variational parameters .      within the mclachlan variational principle , equation , one recognizes no obvious `` hamiltonian relation '' between the energy functional and the equations of motion .",
    "by contrast , such a relation becomes obvious , if we focus on the ansatz from field theory with the hamiltonian density @xmath48 .",
    "the energy functional is then given by @xmath49 which is precisely the result of equation .",
    "within field theory , the dynamics of the wave function @xmath50 is given by ( with the field momentum @xmath51 ) @xmath52 which , for the variational ansatz of the wave function , leads to @xmath53 and , after integration over @xmath54 , is exactly the result of equations . this step only needs a few lines of elementary calculations , including @xmath55 , @xmath56 , a multiplication with the inverse of the derivative @xmath57 ^{-1 } = { { \\partial}\\psi^*}/{{\\partial}z_m^*}$ ] and the two assumptions that @xmath58 and that the @xmath59 be complex , i.e.  the derivatives with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 are independent .",
    "moreover , we note that for @xmath61 the corresponding equation of motion @xmath62 yields the complex conjugate of equation .",
    "vice versa , from equation we see that the equations of motion derived from the tdvp do not only hold in the `` integrated version '' , equations  , but in these equations , we may set the integrands equal to one another , and those directly follow from the hamilton operator @xmath63 and its corresponding hamiltonian density @xmath37 .    from this point of view ,",
    "a `` hamiltonian relation '' between the energy functional and the equations of motion is obvious , and in addition , we obtain the conditions for the variational parameters to be _ complex _ and the variational ansatz for the wave function to fulfil @xmath58 .",
    "the latter requirement directly follows from the cauchy - riemann differential equations , i.e.  the variational ansatz for the wave function has to be complex differentiable in the variational parameters @xmath59 in order to obey this relation .      within the variational approach ,",
    "the dynamics of the wave function and , with it , any `` reaction '' in the system , is given by the vector @xmath64 of the complex and time - dependent variational parameters .",
    "tst may then be applied to the wave packet if one is able to divide the space of the variational parameters  after a suitable definition of the latter  into `` reactants '' and `` products '' , and if the point with the least energy on the dividing surface which forms the `` activated complex '' of the system is a stationary point of saddle - centre-  -centre type of the energy functional .",
    "the corresponding reaction rate is then qualitatively given by the flux over this saddle in the complex @xmath64-space .",
    "however , in order to calculate the flux quantitatively a corresponding hamiltonian in phase space is required .",
    "the definition of the dividing surface and the calculation of the flux were given in reference @xcite , for the case that the corresponding hamiltonian of the system is known .",
    "this is , however , not the case within the variational approach which is based on the energy functional and the equations of motion .",
    "a globally defined hamilton function which describes the system is _ not _ known , in particular the energy functional can not serve as a hamiltonian because of the fact that the equations of motion can not be derived from the former via the canonical equations , and canonical variables are not even defined therein .",
    "nevertheless , as will be shown below it is possible to construct a _",
    "hamiltonian by an appropriate change of variables from the variational parameters @xmath64 to local phase space variables @xmath65 which equivalently describes the dynamics of the variational parameters and at the same time reproduces the energy of the system , given by equation .",
    "therefore , this constructed hamiltonian can be applied to calculating the flux .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we provide the general concept of how to construct this equivalent hamilton function .",
    "it consists of the subsequent steps :    1 .",
    "taylor expand the equations of motion in the vicinity of a fixed point @xmath66 in terms of the variational parameters and diagonalize the latter with respect to their linear part .",
    "2 .   perform a normal form transformation of the taylor expanded equations of motion and introduce canonical variables .",
    "analogously to step ( i ) , taylor expand the energy functional and apply the change of coordinates which corresponds to the transformation from step ( ii ) .",
    "4 .   integrate the equations of motion according to hamilton s equations and adapt the resulting hamiltonian @xmath67 to the transformed energy functional to obtain the final hamilton function @xmath9 .",
    "we assume the differential equations to exhibit a fixed point @xmath66 . to obtain the local classical hamilton function ,",
    "we first taylor expand these equations of motion in the vicinity of the fixed point up to the order @xmath68 and split the expansion into its real and imaginary part .",
    "this results in the @xmath69-dimensional real vector field @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the deviation of the variational parameters from the fixed point and @xmath72 summarizes all terms of the expansion which are homogeneous of degree @xmath7 .    in order to `` simplify '' these differential equations we diagonalize them with respect to their linear part @xmath73 in the next step .",
    "since this is trivial , we will not go into it in more detail .",
    "note , however , that , even if it does not affect the result of the linearised and diagonalized equations of motion , this procedure itself is not unique , because one may work with arbitrary complex multiples of the eigenvectors of which one makes use of in this step .",
    "in contrast to the linearised differential equations , the choice of these multiples does affect higher order terms and the corresponding transformation of the energy functional which is explained in section [ sec - trafo - energy - adaptation ] .",
    "we will use this freedom , among others , to adapt the `` integrated hamiltonian '' to the transformed energy functional in a last step .",
    "to further `` simplify '' the higher order terms of the remaining set of differential equations , we perform a near - identity transformation @xmath74 given by ( cf .",
    "reference [ 13 ] ) @xmath75 where the parameter @xmath76 is chosen in such a way that we obtain the identity - transformation for @xmath77 and @xmath78 solves the differential equation @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the generating function . concerning the normal form transformations which will be applied in the following , we keep close to the notation introduced in reference @xcite and",
    "also use the notion `` normal form '' as defined therein .    under the change of variables , given by a specific generating function",
    "@xmath80 the vector field transforms as @xcite @xmath81 with the lie - operator @xmath82 defined by @xmath83 { \\boldsymbol{a}}({{\\boldsymbol{x } } } ) - \\bigl [ { \\boldsymbol{a}}({{\\boldsymbol{x } } } ) \\cdot \\nabla \\bigr ] { { \\boldsymbol{g}}}({{\\boldsymbol{x } } } ) .",
    "\\label{eq - lie - definition}\\ ] ]    by simply expanding the sum in equation and sorting by the polynomial order @xmath7 it can , with @xmath84 , easily be shown that a generating function @xmath85 which is homogeneous of degree @xmath7 transforms the corresponding term @xmath86 according to the homological equation @xmath87 terms of @xmath88 of lower degree than @xmath7 remain unchanged .",
    "therefore , by choosing a specific degree @xmath7 of the generator @xmath89 , we can normal transform the vector field @xmath88 order by order .    introducing the expansions @xmath90 where we made use of the multi - index notations @xmath91 and @xmath92 with the integer vector @xmath93 , and inserting these into equation",
    "the transformation can be directly applied to the single coefficients which componentwise transform according to @xmath94 here , the @xmath95 are the eigenvalues of the linearised equations of motion . in case of @xmath96",
    "the respective monomial @xmath97 can be eliminated ( @xmath98 ) by an appropriate choice of @xmath99 whereas in the `` resonant '' case @xmath100 it remains unchanged ( @xmath101 ) and _ can not _ be eliminated . hence , the eigenvalues of the linearised equations of motion determine the whole structure of the normal form expansion .    since the equations of motion derived from the tdvp , equations  ,",
    "are invariant under time reversal @xmath102 ( together with @xmath103 ) , the eigenvalues of the linearised equations of motion in general exhibit the structure @xmath104 with @xmath105 , i.e.  they occur pairwise with different sign .",
    "assuming rational independence of the eigenvalues @xmath106 this structure directly implies that equation is fulfilled for @xmath107consequently , the form of the normal form transformed equations of motion is fixed because only monomials satisfying equations and will remain .",
    "we now assume these equations of motion to be sorted in a way that the linear terms occur blockwise according to the eigenvalue structure where each block @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) contains the same eigenvalue differing only in its sign .",
    "then they take the form @xmath110    we now systematically introduce `` canonical '' coordinates @xmath111 and momenta @xmath112 ( @xmath109 ) with the help of which we can rewrite equations and as @xmath113      to obtain the local energy functional in phase space coordinates @xmath114 , we need to apply the change of coordinates corresponding to the normal form transformation of the equations of motion also to the expanded energy functional @xmath115    since the generating function @xmath89 is , for each order , known from the normal form transformation of the vector field @xmath116 , the explicit change of coordinates corresponding to the transformation can easily be obtained . in dependence of the generating function it reads @xcite @xmath117 where the `` right - hand multiplication operator '' @xmath118 is defined by its action @xmath119 on differentiable functions @xmath120 .    inserting the transformation corresponding to each step into the expanded energy functional yields the form @xmath121 the fact that the energy functional can be expressed in products @xmath122 , is here due to the `` hamilton - like '' relation between the equations of motion derived from the tdvp and the energy functional , explained in section [ sec - field - theory ] .",
    "the exponents of the @xmath123 in the @xmath124-th component of the transformed equations of motion  exactly differ by one and do not differ for @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) which is , both , due to the eigenvalue structure and leads to the fact that they can easily be integrated to a common hamilton function @xmath127 according to hamilton s equations @xmath128 this is possible , if the remaining coefficients @xmath129 , after the normal form expansion , satisfy the conditions of integrability @xmath130 for all @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) . note that equation is automatically fulfilled if the diagonalisation of the equations of motion is performed with , in each case , two corresponding complex conjugate eigenvectors which are normalized identically",
    ". however , the equations  are , in general , not automatically satisfied after the transformations performed above .    in a system with one degree of freedom ( @xmath133 )",
    "only the condition plays a role , and the formal integration to the hamiltonian @xmath67 can immediately be carried out .",
    "the tilde on the integrated hamilton function , however , is intended to emphasize that , even if the equations of motion after the normal form expansion can be derived from it according to hamilton s equations , it will , in general , not represent the energy of the system .    in order to achieve both , i.e.  the satisfaction of the conditions of integrability  for systems with @xmath134 degrees of freedom and the local equivalence of the integrated hamiltonian with the energy functional",
    ", a final transformation @xmath135 and @xmath136 is necessary .",
    "the latter makes use of the fact that the transformations performed in sections [ sec - trafo - vector - field ] and [ sec - trafo - energy - adaptation ] still leave some freedom , e.g.  the choice of multiples of eigenvectors when diagonalizing the equations of motion .    for this purpose , we scale the generalized coordinates @xmath135 and the momenta @xmath136 in  and with some time-__in__dependent functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 according to @xmath139 since the @xmath140 and @xmath141 do only occur as products @xmath142 in the integrated hamiltonian @xmath67 as well as in the transformed energy functional",

    "we only demand their product @xmath144 also to be a power series of the products @xmath145 which is necessary in order to preserve the structure of the respective equations .    because both sides of the equations and are scaled according to equation , one of the functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively , cancels out , and the remaining products @xmath146 can be replaced by the expansion . after rearranging the right - hand sides of the respective equations the coefficients of the expansions then depend on the @xmath147 and the conditions of integrability  provide a linear system of equations for their determination .",
    "the latter , however , is underdetermined and to obtain a complete set of equations one also requires the equivalence of the integrated hamiltonian and the transformed energy functional .",
    "the cancelling out of one @xmath137 or @xmath138 in the equations of motion leads to the crucial result that the occurrence of the @xmath147 in the integrated hamiltonian @xmath67 and in the energy functional exactly differs by one order , @xmath148 \\fl e    = \\ , &   e_0 + e_1({{\\boldsymbol{q}}},{{\\boldsymbol{p}}},\\mu_{{{\\boldsymbol{m } } } , { \\left| { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}\\right|}=2 } ) + e_2({{\\boldsymbol{q}}},{{\\boldsymbol{p}}},\\mu_{{{\\boldsymbol{m } } } , { \\left| { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}\\right| } \\leq 3 } )                 + e_3({{\\boldsymbol{q}}},{{\\boldsymbol{p}}},\\mu_{{{\\boldsymbol{m } } } , { \\left| { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}\\right| } \\leq 4 } ) + \\ldots\\ , ,      \\label{eq - mu - occurance - e}\\ ] ] i.e.  the order @xmath7 term @xmath149 of the transformed energy functional contains those @xmath147 with @xmath150 , whereas in the corresponding term of the integrated hamiltonian @xmath67 only the scaling coefficients @xmath147 with @xmath151 occur .    consequently , orderwise comparing the coefficients of the expansions  , yields both the constant of integration @xmath152 and the required equations to uniquely determine the @xmath147",
    "the latter are , finally , determined orderwise as the solutions of a linear system of equations considering that the conditions of integrability  and the requirement of the equations  to be identical are fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "after this proper choice of the @xmath147 and the definition of action - variables by @xmath153 if @xmath154 corresponds to a real eigenvalue @xmath95 and @xmath155 in case of purely imaginary ones @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 this serves as classical hamilton function in the sense that it reproduces the energy of the system , given by equation , and at the same time its hamiltonian equations of motion equivalently to equation describe the dynamics in the vicinity of the fixed point up to some previously chosen order .",
    "after the classical hamilton function has been constructed , classical tst can be applied . in this section ,",
    "we review the formulas to calculate the thermal decay rates which follow from this theory .",
    "we now assume the hamilton function in phase space to exhibit a local minimum corresponding to its metastable ground state .",
    "moreover let there exist an equilibrium point of saddle - centre-  -centre type which is the only channel the system may decay .    the decay rate at a fixed energy",
    "is then given by the flux through a dividing surface which divides the phase space into a region of `` reactants '' and `` products '' , respectively ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "if the system is in contact to a bath of finite temperature , the thermal decay rate is the boltzmann average of this flux .",
    "the directional flux through the dividing surface between the reactant s and product s region in phase space for a fixed energy is @xcite @xmath158 with @xmath159 being the phase space volume of the actions @xmath160 which is enclosed by the contour @xmath161 and @xmath162 corresponding to the `` unstable direction '' of the saddle .",
    "the thermal decay rate is then given by the boltzmann average of equation which , after a short calculation , yields @xmath163 where @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is the canonical partition function ( cf .  reference @xcite ) . since nearly all states will be localized in the vicinity of the local minimum , we will approximate the latter by @xmath166 with @xmath167 being the normal form expansion at the local minimum",
    ".    in general , both integrals in equations and will not converge , which is due to the fact that , when actually computing the normal form , the expansion has to be truncated at some order . to compensate this",
    ", we restrict the phase space volume over which is integrated to the condition @xmath168 taking into account the fact that all frequencies occurring on the tori in phase space have to be non - negative .      for the quantum mechanical case in equation , we proceed analogously .",
    "the quantum mechanical reaction probability for a one - degree - of - freedom system at a fixed energy is given by @xcite @xmath169 where the action variable @xmath24 is implicitly given by @xmath170 .",
    "again the thermal decay rate @xmath171 is given by the boltzmann average of equation which , after integration by parts , reads @xmath172    in the quantum case the canonical partition function is evaluated as a sum @xmath173 and because of the same reasons as in the classical case , we restrict the phase space volume for the integration in equation and the summation in equation to the condition with @xmath174 .",
    "to demonstrate the applicability of the procedure to calculating thermal decay rates within the framework of a variational approach to the quantum mechanical wave function , we consider a cubic model potential @xmath175 it features a local minimum at min@xmath176 and a local maximum at max@xmath177 for @xmath178 ( see figure [ fig - cubic - potential ] ) .",
    "( dashed line ) .",
    "the local minimum at min@xmath176 is the metastable ground state of the system .",
    "a particle in the ground state can , after sufficient thermal excitation , cross the barrier formed by the local maximum at max@xmath177 and will then escape to @xmath179 . within the variational approach ,",
    "the particle is described by a gaussian wave function of fixed width ( solid line ) , and its two stationary states are located at the minimum and the saddle . ]    within the variational approach , we approximate the particle s wave function by a frozen gaussian @xmath180with fixed width @xmath181 .",
    "the centre @xmath182 and momentum @xmath183 of the wave function are combined in the complex variational parameter @xmath184 with real and imaginary part @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively , and @xmath187 gives the normalization of the wave function : @xmath188 . with this definition every point in the complex @xmath184-plane can be identified with a certain position and state of motion of the gaussian wave packet and vice versa .    in this paper , we use a single frozen gaussian , since in this case the energy functional and the equations of motion for the variational parameters can be obtained explicitly .",
    "note , however , that the procedure is neither limited to _ gaussian _ wave functions nor to the use of a _ single _ gaussian , but can without any change also be applied to wave packets of _ coupled _ gaussians ( cf .",

    "the complex @xmath184-plane can be divided , by solving the equations of motion ",
    ", in a region of reactants and products , respectively",
    ". the reaction rate is then given by the flux through the dividing surface between these two regions .",
    "thermal excitation now enables a wave packet corresponding to the reactants to cross the barrier of the potential @xmath191 and to become a product . for low temperatures ,",
    "the reaction path will cross the dividing surface at its point with the least energy .",
    "this point in the @xmath184-plane is a saddle of the energy functional , consequently the decay rate of the system is given by the flux over this saddle .",
    "however , since @xmath184 is a `` bad '' variable in the sense that  as already stated in section [ sec - mapping - to - phase - space ]  the equations of motion  can not be derived from the energy functional by the canonical equations , the latter can not be regarded as a hamilton function which allows for the calculation of the flux .    in order to obtain a hamilton function @xmath197 which can be used for this purpose , we perform the steps described in section [ sec - mapping - to - phase - space ] , i.e.  we determine the fixed points of the equations  , expand them in their vicinity and order by order perform a normal form transformation . after integrating and adapting the result to the transformed energy functional , we end up with the desired hamiltonian which is locally equivalent to the equations . to illustrate the procedure in a more descriptive way",
    ", we provide a numerical example in the appendix for a certain set of parameters .",
    "note that  as it is also the case in the analogous classical system of a point particle in the potential @xmath191  the equations of motion  exhibit two fixed points .",
    "one of them corresponds to the metastable ground state of the system and the other to an unstable excited state , whose corresponding wave function is located in the vicinity of the potential s local maximum . while the ground state also exists in the framework of the exact schrdinger equation ,",
    "the existence of the unstable excited state is a consequence of the ansatz of the wave function within the variational approach .",
    "a wave packet which is located at the maximum of the potential @xmath191 is , of course , not a stationary solution of the exact schrdinger equation , but would dissolve . within the variational approach ,",
    "this dissolving character , however , is taken into account by the instability of this state .",
    "note furthermore , that the eigenvalues of the linearised equations of motion at the fixed points , which crucially determine the normal form expansion and , with it , the constructed hamiltonian @xmath197 , approximately reproduce the eigenfrequency of the harmonic oscillator which one obtains by harmonically approximating the potential @xmath191 at its minimum and maximum , respectively . for wave functions with smaller extension ( larger @xmath198 )",
    "the eigenvalues converge to the oscillation frequency of the harmonic oscillator and in the limit @xmath199 exactly reproduce it as is expected , since the dynamics of a strongly localized wave packet will be the same as that of a point particle .",
    "the data have been calculated in dependence of the parameter @xmath200 , for a temperature of @xmath201 and a barrier height of @xmath202 in equation . in the limit @xmath199 of a very narrow wave function ( empty circles )",
    "the variational ansatz covers the results of the classical normal form while the decay rates obtained from this method increase with decreasing width parameter @xmath198 ( triangles and filled circles ) . for a broad wave function ( squares )",
    "it shows a perfect match with the decay rate obtained from the quantum normal form of the corresponding point particle . ]    in order to compare the thermal decay rates calculated by the different methods we first determine the quantum and the classical normal form of a point particle in the model potential @xmath191 from equation and its normal form analogue of the variational parameter space as described in section [ sec - mapping - to - phase - space ] .",
    "the thermal decay rates are then given by equation for the classical case and equation for the quantum case ( for the latter we set @xmath33 throughout ) .",
    "figure [ fig - different - width - parameter ] shows a comparison of the thermal decay rates calculated for the cubic potential by the three methods in dependence of the parameter @xmath200 of the potential and for different width parameters @xmath198 of the gaussian trial wave function .",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath203 and we use a barrier height of @xmath202 in equation .",
    "the classical ( solid line ) and quantum ( dashed line ) normal forms reveal a significantly differing decay rate which is especially pronounced for small @xmath200 due to the quantization effects in the narrow potential well .",
    "the variational approach with a single gaussian trial wave function , however , is able to reproduce both curves . in the limit of a very narrow wave function ( empty circles ) ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath199 , we find a perfect match of the latter with the classical result .",
    "when we increase the width of the gaussian wave function , also the decay rate increases ( triangles and filled circles ) . for a width of @xmath204 ( squares ) , we finally recover the decay rate calculated from the quantum normal form of the corresponding point particle .",
    "the classical limit of the decay rate can easily be understood considering the classical limit of the variational wave function . for the narrow wave function",
    ", only the local properties of the potential will be of importance so that the potential can be approximated harmonically in this limit .",
    "the characteristic width of the gaussian is then obtained from that of the ground state wave function of the harmonic oscillator , which is given by @xmath205 , with @xmath206 . the classical limit @xmath207 then yields @xmath199 for which we observe convergence of the decay rate obtained from the variational approach to the one obtained from the classical normal form . for broad wave functions the anharmonicity of the potential becomes relevant and",
    "the width of the harmonic oscillator will be only a crude approximation .",
    "for @xmath33 the width of @xmath204 , for which we observed good agreement with the quantum normal form result , is in accordance with the width of the harmonic oscillator ground state within about a factor of @xmath208 over the whole range . according to this ,",
    "intermediate values @xmath209 correspond to effective values @xmath210 of the planck constant .",
    "we compare the results of the classical ( solid lines ) and quantum ( dashed lines ) normal forms as well as the variational approach in the limit of broad ( squares ) and narrow ( empty circles ) gaussian trial wave functions . with increasing temperature ,",
    "also the decay rates increase and the difference between the classical and quantum normal forms becomes smaller in the same way as the two cases of narrow and broad wave function do within the variational approach .",
    "for @xmath211 the decay rates calculated by the different methods can not be distinguished any more . ]",
    "we further observe this behaviour at different temperatures as can be seen in figure [ fig - different - temp ] for some exemplary values .",
    "again , the results using the classical normal form ( solid lines ) are perfectly recovered within the limit @xmath212 of very narrow wave functions ( empty circles ) and for broad ones ( squares ) the decay rates agree with those obtained from quantum normal form ( dashed lines ) .    with increasing temperature",
    ", the calculated decay rates also increase rapidly by several orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the difference between the classical and the quantum normal forms becomes smaller as well as it does for the two limits of the wave function concerning their width . at high temperatures compared to the height of the potential barrier",
    "we reach the classical limit . for the parameters used here ,",
    "this is the case for @xmath211 , where the difference of the decay rates calculated by the three methods vanishes and they can not be distinguished any more .",
    "we emphasize that  in contrast to the classical and the quantum normal form  the method with wave packets described by the tdvp does _ not _ require a hamilton function for the system to be known at the beginning of the procedure . instead",
    ", only an expression for the energy functional and a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of the variational parameters are necessary .",
    "the required hamiltonian is , after the mapping to phase space coordinates , a natural result of the transformations discussed in this paper .",
    "we have presented a method to apply transition state theory to wave packet dynamics in metastable schrdinger systems , which is based on local expansions of the energy functional and the equations of motions derived from a time - dependent variational principle in the vicinity of the barrier fixed point of saddle - centre-  -centre type . fulfilling the integrability conditions , the equations of motion can , after a normal form expansion , be integrated to a common hamilton function expressed in action - variables .",
    "its equivalence to the energy functional is guaranteed by an additional transformation adapting it to the latter .    to demonstrate the method , we calculated thermal decay rates of a particle placed at the metastable ground state of a cubic potential . on the one hand",
    "the decay rate was obtained by the hamilton function of a point particle using the classical and quantum normal forms . on the other hand",
    "this was done by the presented method with a frozen gaussian wave function of different width described in the framework of a variational approach to the schrdinger equation and the results show an excellent agreement with the well established methods .",
    "the application of the variational approach to wave packets within the framework of a time - dependent variational principle together with the demonstrated mapping to classical phase space further allows to calculate decay rates for quantum mechanical systems where an analogous classical hamiltonian is not directly accessible .",
    "such systems are , e.g.  bose - einstein condensates with additional long - range interaction which have been successfully approached variationally with coupled gaussian wave functions @xcite . in case of an attractive short - range contact interaction ,",
    "their ground state is metastable and a sufficient thermal excitation may lead to the collapse of the condensate by crossing a barrier which is formed by an unstable excited state that reveals the properties of a saddle - centre-  -centre equilibrium point .",
    "thus , the variational approach to becs is predestined for the procedure presented in this paper and we refer the reader to reference @xcite for the application to these ultra - cold gases .    of course ,",
    "this method can also be applied to the field of chemical reactions where the behaviour of reactants can be studied without approximations such as in the framework of an ab initio calculated born - oppenheimer potential energy surface if a suitable parametrization of the system s wave function has been found .",
    "this work was supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "is grateful for support from the landesgraduiertenfrderung of the land baden - wrttemberg .",
    "we also thank thomas bartsch for fruitful discussions .",
    "in order to give a descriptive illustration of the variational parameters mapping to classical phase space , we present in this appendix a numerical example for the parameters @xmath204 , @xmath202 and @xmath213 in fifth order of the equations of motion and sixth order of the energy functional , respectively",
    ".    for this set of parameters the taylor expansion of the equations of motion  in the vicinity of the stable fixed point reads @xmath214 and for the corresponding expansion of the energy functional one obtains @xmath215 at this point , there is no obvious way to derive equations and from equation via hamilton s equations .    with the eigenvalues @xmath216 , the normal form expansion of the equations of motion and the introduction of the canonical variables @xmath217 , @xmath218 results in @xmath219 for equations and , where the higher - order terms have arisen during the transformations .",
    "the coefficients on the right - hand side of these two equations only differ in sign and therefore fulfil the conditions of integrability . consequently , they can easily be integrated to a hamilton function @xmath220    however , after having applied the change of coordinates corresponding to the transformation above , the energy functional reads @xmath221 whose coefficients do not agree with equation .    to achieve this",
    ", we apply the scaling of the phase space variables @xmath222 and @xmath223 according to equations  which after integration of the equations of motion together with the definition of the action - variable @xmath224 leads to @xmath225      e = & ~    1.90363 + 0.983756 { \\mathrm{i}}\\mu_1 j + ( 0.00830456 \\mu_1 ^ 2 - 0.983756 \\mu_2 ) j^2   \\nonumber \\\\              & + ( 0.000219661{\\mathrm{i}}\\mu_1 ^ 3 + 0.0166091{\\mathrm{i}}\\mu_1 \\mu_2 ) j^3 .      \\label{appendix - after - mu - scaling}\\ ] ] setting the constant of integration to @xmath226 and choosing @xmath227 , @xmath228 finally yields @xmath229 which is the desired hamilton function in third order of the action - variables .",
