    "thus , at large distances the physically motivated asymptotics of the correlator is exponentially decreasing .",
    "the gluon correlators are the base elements of the stochastic model of vacuum @xcite and in the description of high - energy hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "measuring the correlation length and vacuum field correlators was the motivation to investigate these quantities on the lattice .",
    "new high - statistical lqcd measurements of the gauge - invariant bilocal correlator of the gluon field strengths have become available down to a distance of @xmath33 fm @xcite .",
    "recently , the field strength correlators have also been studied in the effective dual abelian higgs model in @xcite and qcd sum rule approach @xcite . in all these approaches ( see also @xcite ) , the exponential decay of the correlators at large distances has been observed .",
    "however , these investigations still omit a small and intermediate distances behavior of the nonlocal condensates .",
    "on the other hand , in qcd there is an instanton @xcite , a well known nontrivial nonlocal vacuum solution of the classical euclidean yang - mills equations with finite action and size @xmath34 .",
    "the importance of instantons for qcd is that it is believed that an interacting instanton ensemble provides a realistic microscopic picture of the qcd vacuum in the form of instanton liquid @xcite ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , a review @xcite ) .",
    "it has been argued on phenomenological grounds that the distribution of instantons over sizes is peaked at a typical value @xmath35 and the liquid is dilute in the sense that mean separation between instantons is much larger than the average instanton size .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the instanton model of the qcd vacuum provides a way to construct nonlocal vacuum condensates .",
    "within the effective single instanton ( si ) approximation we have obtained the expressions for the nonlocal gluon @xmath36 and quark @xmath37 condensates and derived the average virtualities of quarks @xmath38 and gluons @xmath39 in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it has been found that due to specific properties of the si approximation ( self - duality of the field ) the @xmath0 gluon form factor is exactly zero .",
    "the behavior of the correlation functions demonstrates that in the si approximation the model of nonlocal condensates can well reproduce the behavior of the quark and gluon correlators at _ short distances_. really , the quark and gluon average virtualities , defined via the first derivatives of the nonlocal condensates @xmath40 ,  @xmath41 at the origin , @xmath42 are connected with vevs that parameterize the qcd sr , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 estimated in the qcd sr analysis @xcite is reproduced at @xmath48 .",
    "this number is close to the estimate from the phenomenology of the qcd vacuum in the instanton liquid model .",
    "the model provides parameterless prediction for the ratio @xmath49 and so , @xmath50 . in @xcite",
    "the effect of the inclusion of schwinger exponent into semiclassical calculations has been analyzed .",
    "for some quantities this effect is very strong , being of an order of @xmath51 for gluon and quark average virtualities .",
    "nevertheless , the si approximation used evidently fails in the description of physically argued distributions at large distances . in asymptotics",
    ", we have found @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the quark and gluon correlators , respectively .",
    "thus , the si solution over mathematical vacuum provides too slow asymptotics at large distances.we should conclude that in order to have a realistic model of vacuum correlators , the important effects of instanton interaction with the long - wave vacuum configurations have to be included .",
    "the key point in the picture of realistic instanton vacuum is the interaction of pseudoparticles in the vacuum . in @xcite ,",
    "the interaction of a si with an arbitrary weak external field has been examined and dipole - dipole forces in a far separated instanton - anti - instanton system derived .",
    "later in @xcite , this background field has been interpreted as a field of large - scale qcd vacuum fluctuations , and the influence of the quark and gluon condensates on the instanton density has been considered .",
    "the main assumption of the instanton liquid models @xcite is the dominance of the instanton component in the vacuum and that , in particularly , the gluon condensate is saturated by weakly interacting instanton liquid . in deriving instanton ensemble properties",
    "the instanton - anti - instanton interaction at intermediate separation start to play the crucial role in stabilization of the liquid @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the final result strongly depends on the field ansatz for an instanton - anti - instanton configuration @xcite .",
    "further , in all instanton - anti - instanton ansatze suggested the influence of the physical vacuum on an instanton profile function has not been taken into account and the profile has only power decreasing asymptotics , which contradicts the expectations concerning the vacuum field correlators .",
    "moreover , it is known that the instanton liquid is not responsible for large - scale effects like confinement @xcite .",
    "another point is that the instanton density @xmath54 in the instanton liquid models is normalized by the value of the gluon condensate @xmath55 gev@xmath56 obtained in @xcite from an analysis of charmonium spectrum .",
    "more recently in @xcite , a detailed analysis based on charmonium , bottonium and heavy - light mesons have led to a twice larger value of the gluon condensate @xmath57 gev@xmath56 .",
    "indefiniteness in the normalization provides a window for existence of a large - scale field component in the qcd vacuum along with short - scale instantons .    in the present work , assuming dominance of the weak interacting instanton liquid in the qcd vacuum , we suggest that there is also a weak residual component of the vacuum field with a large correlation length @xmath58 of the order of the confinement size .",
    "we are going to show , assuming only very general properties of a weak large - scale vacuum field , that it deforms an instanton at large distances leading to exponentially decreasing asymptotics of the instanton profile and the instanton induced vacuum field correlators .",
    "the vacuum model considered is a two - phase one .",
    "the large - scale phase is described by the background field and dominates at distances compared with the confinement size .",
    "the short - scale phase is dominated by instantons and is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the solution of the @xmath59 problem .",
    "the vacuum model suggested reveals a definite non - locality mechanism in the framework of qcd .",
    "we shall illustrate this by analyzing the vacuum gluon form factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , the normalization of contributions from different phases to the gluon condensate is not fixed by the instanton model and remains as a free parameter , but the form of the correlation functions can be described in detail .",
    "the latter is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "the determination of the vacuum field correlators is one of the main tasks of the theory in describing the non - perturbative dynamics at large distances compatible with the typical hadron size .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the instanton field in the background of weak large - scale vacuum fluctuations is considered ; solutions of the vacuum field equations for small and large distances are analyzed separately and the constrained instanton solution interpolating two asymptotics is suggested in an ansatz form . in section 3 ,",
    "the space coordinate behavior of the nonlocal correlator of the gluon field strengths is found and the main asymptotics of the correlators @xmath60 , @xmath62 at large distances are derived .",
    "these asymptotics are driven by the strength and correlation length of the large - scale vacuum fluctuations , rather than by their form .",
    "the classical yang - mills equations in the euclidean space @xmath63 where the covariant derivative is @xmath64 , have an instanton @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is for an anti - instanton ) as a ( anti ) self - dual finite - action solution with topological charge , @xmath67 : @xmath68 localized in size @xmath34 . in ( [ ainst ] ) , @xmath69 is the position of the instanton center , @xmath70 is the ortogonal matrix of instanton global orientation in the color space and @xmath71 are thooft symbols .",
    "the solution ( [ ainst ] ) is written in the _ singular _ gauge within the @xmath72 subgroup ( with generators @xmath73 ) of the @xmath74 theory .",
    "this classical field configuration reflects the symmetries of the initial theory in terms of collective variables corresponding to translational transformations , rotational symmetry in color space and conform transformations .",
    "the solution ( [ ainst ] ) is given in mathematical vacuum and has an unpleasant property of a very slow decay at large distances noted in the introduction .",
    "this situation is inadequate since the physical vacuum is not empty but looks like a medium densely populated by large - scale vacuum field fluctuations . in the background of the large scale fluctuations there",
    "are developed non - perturbative fluctuations of a smaller size among those instantons which play a dominating role .",
    "the long - wave gluon vacuum field , which is the background for a selected instanton , may be of a more general origin and phenomenologically can be parameterized by the vacuum correlation functions of the gluon operators contributing to the corresponding nonlocal condensates .",
    "what is important is that at _ random _ ( stochastic ) background vacuum field with _ fixed _",
    "vacuum expectation values of singlet operators the scale invariance of the effective theory is spoiled already at the quasi - classical level and the instantons are _ no longer exact solutions _ of the field equations and the dirac operator has no zero modes .",
    "the similar situation has been observed in the standard electroweak yang - mills - higgs model .",
    "there , the background of higgs field with nonzero vacuum value @xmath75 and coupling @xmath31 affects the instanton configuration @xcite . in the presence of (",
    "even small ) effects violating scale invariance of the initial theory , instanton solution does not exist at all . nevertheless , as it was stated in @xcite and fairly explained in @xcite , if the higgs field is rather weak and some additional constraints are introduced , there may be constructed an approximate solution , so - called , constrained instanton ( ci ) .",
    "these constraints limit the degree of freedom along the size @xmath34 parameter .",
    "the constrained solution at small distances @xmath76 approximately has the form of an instanton , and at large distances @xmath77 has the asymptotics of massive ( gauge boson ) particle @xmath78 . in @xcite",
    ", it has also been noted that the gauge field propagator of the cis decays exponentially at large @xmath79 and thus does not affect the long - range behavior of the theory .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that an analogous phenomenon takes place in qcd considering an instanton field @xmath80 in the physical vacuum . in distinction with the yang - mills - higgs model ,",
    "in pure qcd there is no higgs field from the beginning and it is the long - scale vacuum gluon field , @xmath81 , that models a source perturbing an instanton at large distances .",
    "the deep reason of this effect is in an existence of the quantum anomaly in the trace of energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the presence of this background field , characterized by its vacuum expectation value @xmath82 and correlation length @xmath58 ( introduced below ) , sets the final scale and defines the deformation of the instanton solution in the asymptotic region @xmath83",

    "this solution is stable against shrinking the instanton to a point if some constraints are added . by analogy with the solutions analyzed in the yang - mills - higgs model @xcite , we shell call these interpolating fields constrained ( or deformed ) instanton solutions .    in the following",
    "we analyze the vacuum field configuration of the single ( constrained ) instanton @xmath86 of fixed size and orientation in the color space in the background of the large - scale topologically neutral random vacuum field @xmath81 @xmath87 with gauge transformation property @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a gauge transformation matrix . considering the field ansatz ( [ atot ] )",
    ", one has to take the instanton field @xmath90 in the _ singular _ gauge @xcite @xmath91 the last conditions mean that the constrained instanton has a finite action and a modulo unit topological charge , but , in general , ceases to be self - dual field . in the coordinate space the instantons in this specific gauge fall off rapidly enough to provide a weak interaction with the background field and the quasi - classical approach is justified .",
    "the weakness of the interaction allow us in the following to neglect the back reaction of the instanton on the background field .",
    "as to nonperturbative background field it is convenient to choose it in the fock - schwinger gauge @xcite @xmath92 in the following we put the instanton center @xmath69 to the origin of coordinates @xmath93 .    as an illustrative model for the background field , one can keep in mind the self - dual homogeneous vacuum gluon field @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the orientation vector in color space and @xmath96 is the constant field - strength tensor @xcite .",

    "below , these terms will effectively be accumulated in the form of constraints below and , what is important in the present consideration , they do not influence the form of the solution at asymptotics .",
    "similar to affleck analysis @xcite , we come to the conclusion that for a background field configuration @xmath81 with a _ fixed _",
