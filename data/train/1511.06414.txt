    "a tokamak is a device that is designed to trap a thermonuclear plasma on a set of toroidally - nested magnetic flux - surfaces.@xcite heat and particles are able to flow around the flux - surfaces relatively rapidly due to the free streaming of charged particles along magnetic field - lines . on the other hand ,",
    "heat and particles are only able to diffuse across the flux - surfaces relatively slowly , assuming that the magnetic field - strength is large enough to render the particle gyroradii much smaller than the device s",
    "minor radius.@xcite    tokamak plasmas are subject to a number of macroscopic instabilities that limit their effectiveness.@xcite such instabilities can be divided into two broad classes .",
    "so - called ideal instabilities are non - reconnecting modes that disrupt the plasma in a matter of micro - seconds .",
    "however , such instabilities can easily be avoided by limiting the plasma pressure and the net toroidal current.@xcite tearing modes , on the other hand , are relatively slowly growing instabilities that are more difficult to avoid.@xcite these instabilities tend to saturate at relatively low levels,@xcite in the process reconnecting magnetic flux - surfaces to form helical structures known as magnetic island chains .",
    "magnetic island chains are radially localized structures centered on so - called rational flux - surfaces , which satisfy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wave - number of the instability , and @xmath4 the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "island chains degrade plasma confinement because they enable heat and particles to flow very rapidly along field - lines from their inner to their outer radii , implying an almost complete loss of confinement in the region lying between these radii.@xcite    as is well known , tearing mode dynamics in high - temperature tokamak plasmas is poorly described by the standard , single - fluid , resistive - magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) model.@xcite indeed , in order to obtain realistic predictions , at an absolute minimum , the resistive - mhd model must be replaced by a two - fluid , drift - mhd model . broadly speaking , the drift - mhd model predicts the existence of two separate branches of nonlinear tearing mode solutions.@xcite _ ion - branch _ solutions are characterized by a flattened pressure profile within the island chain s magnetic separatrix , a relatively large radial island width ( compared to the poloidal ion gyroradius ) , a propagation velocity similar to that of the unperturbed local perpendicular ion fluid velocity , and no emission of drift - waves . on the other hand , _ electron - branch _",
    "solutions are characterized by a non - flattened pressure profile within the magnetic separatrix , a relatively small radial width , a propagation velocity close to that of the unperturbed local perpendicular electron fluid velocity , and the emission of drift - waves .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the ion solution branch ceases to exist below a critical island width , whereas the electron solution branch ceases to exist above a second , somewhat larger , critical width.@xcite the disappearance of one branch of solutions is associated with a bifurcation to the other branch.@xcite    this paper is concerned with the ion branch of nonlinear tearing mode solutions .",
    "the flattening of the pressure profile in the region lying within the island separatrix of such solutions gives rise to the disappearance of the neoclassical bootstrap current@xcite there , which has a strong destabilizing effect on the mode.@xcite indeed , this effect is so marked that , unless countered , it would give rise to the formation of magnetic island chains on every rational surface within the plasma , causing the complete destruction of magnetic flux - surfaces.@xcite in reality , this is not found to be the case .",
    "instead , so - called _ neoclassical tearing modes _ ( i.e. , tearing modes driven unstable by the perturbed bootstrap current ) are only observed to form on a few low mode - number rational surfaces within the plasma.@xcite this implies the existence of a stabilizing mechanism that counters the destabilizing effect of the perturbed bootstrap current .",
    "two possible mechanisms have been identified in the literature .",
    "first , the finite parallel transport in tokamak plasmas , combined with enhanced perpendicular transport due to plasma turbulence , may not allow the flattening of the pressure profile within the magnetic separatrix.@xcite however , this mechanism is only effective for relatively thin islands , and is not relevant to the ion solution branch . the second stabilization mechanism , which appears to be the only feasible mechanism for the ion branch , is associated with the perturbed ion polarization current.@xcite    calculating the effect of the perturbed ion polarization current on nonlinear tearing mode stability in a two - fluid plasma turns out to be a rather difficult task , for a number of reasons .",
    "the first difficulty is that the sign of the polarization term in the island width evolution equation depends crucially on the island propagation velocity .",
    "generally speaking , the polarization term has one sign if the propagation velocity lies between the unperturbed local perpendicular guiding - center fluid velocity and the unperturbed local perpendicular ion fluid velocity , and the opposite sign otherwise.@xcite thus , a meaningful calculation of the polarization term must also be coupled with a calculation of the island propagation velocity .",
    "the latter calculation involves a self - consistent determination of the pressure and scalar electric potential profiles in the vicinity of the island chain.@xcite the second difficulty is that the dominant contribution to the polarization term originates from a boundary layer on the island chain s magnetic separatrix.@xcite this contribution is such that the polarization term is stabilizing when the island propagation velocity lies between the unperturbed local perpendicular guiding - center fluid velocity and the unperturbed local perpendicular ion fluid velocity , and destabilizing otherwise.@xcite if the contribution of the boundary layer is omitted then the sign of the polarization term is reversed ( so that the term is destabilizing when the island propagation velocity lies between the unperturbed local perpendicular guiding - center fluid velocity and the unperturbed local perpendicular ion fluid velocity , and stabilizing otherwise).@xcite unfortunately , the contribution of the separatrix boundary layer to the polarization term is a very sensitive function of the thickness of the layer.@xcite the final difficulty is that the magnitude of the polarization term is profoundly affected by neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping.@xcite indeed , if the damping is sufficiently large then it gives rise to a coupling of the perpendicular and parallel ion flows that acts to significantly enhance the magnitude of the polarization term.@xcite    incidentally , because ion - branch magnetic islands are much wider than the poloidal ion gyroradius ( and , hence , the ion banana width ) , it is reasonable to assume that the response of both trapped and passing ions to the perturbed electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of the island chain can be adequately captured by a fluid model .",
    "of course , such an assumption would not be not reasonable for island chains whose widths are comparable to , or less than , the ion poloidal gyroradius.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to present a two - fluid calculation of the ion polarization term appearing in the island width evolution equation of a neoclassical tearing mode in a high - temperature tokamak plasma .",
    "the calculation is performed using a neoclassical , four - field , drift - mhd model .",
    "the model itself was developed , and gradually improved , in refs .  .",
    "the core of the model is a single - helicity version of the well - known four - field model of hazeltine , kotschenreuther , and morrison.@xcite the core model is augmented by phenomenological terms representing anomalous cross - field particle and momentum transport due to small - scale plasma turbulence .",
    "finally , the model includes approximate ( i.e. , flux - surface averaged ) expressions for the divergence of the neoclassical ion and electron stress tensors .",
    "these expressions allow us to incorporate the bootstrap current , as well as neoclassical ion poloidal and perpendicular flow damping , into the model .",
    "note that perpendicular flow damping , which is due to nonambipolar transport associated with the breaking of toroidal symmetry by the tearing perturbation ( and , possibly , by external magnetic perturbations),@xcite is often referred to in the literature as `` toroidal '' flow damping .",
    "this name is somewhat misleading , because the damping actually acts on the perpendicular component of the ion fluid velocity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . the neoclassical , four - field , drift - mhd model that forms the basic of our analysis",
    "is introduced in sect .",
    "[ s2 ] . in sect .",
    "[ s3 ] , we calculate the ion polarization term for the case in which the neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is not large enough to enhance the term s magnitude . in sect .  [ s4 ] , we calculate the polarization term in the opposite case in which the flow damping is large enough to significantly enhance the term s magnitude . the paper is summarized in sect .",
    "[ s5 ] .    the general form of the calculations outlined in sects .",
    "[ s3 ] and [ s4 ] is similar to those described in ref .  .",
    "however , many of the details of the calculations are significantly modified by the improvements in the expressions for the divergences of the neoclassical stress tensors introduced in ref .  .",
    "these improvements are as follows .",
    "first , we have taken into account the fact that the neoclassical velocities towards which the divergences of the neoclassical stress tensors relax the electron and ion velocities are proportional to local electron and ion temperature gradients , respectively , and are , therefore , affected by the modifications to these gradients induced by the presence of the island chain .",
    "second , we have taken into account the fact that that the divergence of the neoclassical ion perpendicular stress tensor generates a force that is primarily directed perpendicular to magnetic field - lines ( within a given flux - surface ) , rather than in the toroidal direction .",
    "in addition , we have incorporated magnetic field - line curvature , the bootstrap current , and independent equilibrium number density , electron temperature , and ion temperature gradients into the model .",
    "consider a large aspect - ratio , low-@xmath5 , circular cross - section , tokamak plasma equilibrium of major radius @xmath6 , and toroidal magnetic field - strength @xmath7 .",
    "let us adopt a right - handed , quasi - cylindrical , toroidal coordinate system ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , whose symmetry axis ( @xmath11 ) coincides with the magnetic axis .",
    "the coordinate @xmath8 also serves as a label for the unperturbed ( by the island chain ) magnetic flux - surfaces .",
    "let the equilibrium toroidal magnetic field and toroidal plasma current both run in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "suppose that a helical magnetic island chain , with @xmath13 poloidal periods , and @xmath14 toroidal periods , is embedded in the aforementioned plasma .",
    "the island chain is assumed to be radially localized in the vicinity of its associated rational surface , minor radius @xmath15 , which is defined as the unperturbed magnetic flux - surface at which @xmath16 .",
    "here , @xmath17 is the safety - factor profile ( which is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 ) .",
    "let the full radial width of the island chain s magnetic separatrix be @xmath18 . in the following",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the plasma is conveniently divided into an inner region , that comprises the plasma in the immediate vicinity of the rational surface ( and includes the island chain ) , and an outer region that comprises the remainder of the plasma . as is well known , in a high - temperature tokamak plasma , linear , ideal , mhd analysis invariably suffices to calculate the mode structure in the outer region , whereas nonlinear , nonideal , drift - mhd analysis is generally required in the inner region .",
    "let us assume that the linear , ideal , mhd solution has been found in the outer region . in the absence of an external perturbation , such a solution is characterized by a single real parameter , @xmath21 , ( with units of inverse length ) known as the tearing stability index.@xcite the tearing stability index measures the free energy available in the outer region to cause a spontaneous change in the island chain s radial width .",
    "this free energy acts to increase the width if @xmath22 , and vice versa .",
    "it remains to obtain a nonlinear , nonideal , drift - mhd solution in the inner region , and then to asymptotically match this solution to the aforementioned linear , ideal , mhd solution at the boundary between the inner and outer regions .",
    "all fields in the inner region are assumed to depend only on the normalized radial coordinate @xmath23 , and the helical angle @xmath24 . in particular , the electron number density , electron temperature , and ion temperature profiles in the inner region take the forms @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively , here , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath1 are uniform constants .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density scale - length at the rational surface .",
    "note that we are assuming , for the sake of simplicity , that @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , et cetera .",
    "it follows that the flattening of the electron density profile within the island separatrix also implies the flattening of the electron and ion temperature profiles .",
    "this approach is suitable for relatively wide , ion - branch magnetic island chains , where we expect complete flattening of the pressure profile within the island separatrix , but would not be suitable for relatively narrow , electron - branch island chains , where we expect the electron temperature profile to be flattened , but not the electron density and ion temperature profiles.@xcite    it is convenient to define the poloidal wavenumber , @xmath38 , the resonant safety - factor , @xmath39 , the inverse aspect - ratio , @xmath40 , the ion diamagnetic speed , @xmath41 the electron diamagnetic speed , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 the poloidal ion gyroradius , @xmath44^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{m_i}{e\\,b_0}\\right),\\ ] ] and the ion beta , @xmath45 all of these quantities are evaluated at the rational surface . here",
