    "the abundance of supermassive black holes is the subject of considerable current interest ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al . 2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ; yu & lu 2004 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "several groups have noted that galaxy formation and supermassive black holes growth should be linked , and many have modeled the joint cosmological evolution of quasars and galaxies ( see , e.g. , monaco et al .",
    "2000 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2001 ; granato et al . 2001",
    "; cavaliere & vittorini 2002 ; cattaneo & bernardi 2003 ; haiman et al .",
    "2004 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ; lapi et al . 2006 ; haiman et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "since the number of black hole detections to date is less than fifty , their abundance is estimated by using secondary indicators .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 is observed to correlate strongly and tightly with the velocity dispersion of the surrounding bulge ( e.g. ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "since detecting bulges is considerably easier than detecting black holes , it has become common to estimate the abundance of black holes by combining the observed distribution of bulge velocity dispersions ( e.g. sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) with the observed @xmath1 relation .",
    "a crude estimate follows easily if one is willing to assume that all bulges host black holes , and that the @xmath1 relation has no intrinsic scatter ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 ; aller & richstone 2002 ) .",
    "there is some discussion in the literature about whether @xmath4 or @xmath5 is a better predictor of @xmath6 .",
    "there are two parts to this statement which are not always stated explicitly .",
    "the first is the assumption that the @xmath7observable relation is a single power law ; whether this is a better approximation for @xmath4 than for @xmath5 is an open question , although lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that the curvature in the @xmath3 relation for massive early - type galaxies ( bernardi et al . 2007a ; bernardi 2007 )",
    "suggests that the @xmath1 relation is unlikely to be a single power - law . in what follows",
    ", we will assume the relations in question are indeed single power laws .",
    "the second is the issue of the scatter around the mean relations .",
    "it is generally believed that the relation with smaller scatter provides the better estimate of the @xmath6 distribution . indeed , marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) state that if the scatter around two relations is similar , then both relations should provide equivalent descriptions of the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to show that this is not the whole story .",
    "provided the intrinsic scatter around the two relations is accurately known , whether or not one relation is tighter than another is irrelevant .",
    "( the only practical difference is that , if the intrinsic scatter is smaller , then observations of fewer objects are required to estimate it reliably . )",
    "both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations show considerable scatter , not all of which can be accounted - for by measurement errors .",
    "marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) present evidence that the amount by which an object scatters from these relations is correlated with bulge size ( half light radius ) , suggesting that at least some component of the scatter is intrinsic .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath6 at fixed velocity dispersion is of order 0.25  dex , whereas scatter around @xmath8 is about 0.35  dex ( e.g. novak et al .",
    "if the intrinsic scatter is indeed this large , then it must be accounted for , especially when estimating the abundances of the most massive black holes ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "section  2 describes a toy model of the effects of scatter which shows that , ( i ) if intrinsic scatter is ignored , then both the @xmath4- and @xmath5-based predictions will underestimate the true abundance of the most massive black holes ; ( ii ) the observable which correlates most tightly with @xmath6 will provide the best estimate of the true abundance of the most massive black holes ; ( iii ) if scatter has been correctly accounted for , @xmath5- and @xmath4-based predictors of @xmath6 abundances should give the same answer .",
    "it then shows the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 correlations , their scatter , and how we use them to estimate black hole abundances .",
    "a direct comparison of the luminosity and velocity dispersion based predictors is provided , both when intrinsic scatter in these relations is accounted for and when it is ignored .",
    "we find that , if scatter is ignored , then the @xmath4-based method predicts substantially more @xmath10 objects than does the @xmath5-based method .",
    "the toy model suggests that this may be a consequence of ignoring the intrinsic scatter .",
    "however , accounting for this scatter does not eliminate this discrepancy , suggesting that there may be a more serious inconsistency .",
    "section  3 identifies the reason for this discrepancy with the fact that the @xmath3 relation in the sdss / bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) ( hereafter sdss - b07 ; see bernardi 2007 for the definition of the sdss - b07 sample ) , from which the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions are drawn , is rather different from that in the black hole samples , from which the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations are derived .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the role of selection effects in the @xmath6 sample is presented in bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "a final section discusses our findings and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "a standard flat @xmath11cdm comological model has been used , with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "the first part of this section discusses the effect of intrinsic scatter in @xmath6-observable relations on inferences about black hole abundances .",
    "the second part shows various @xmath6-observable correlations in the compilation of hring & rix ( 2004 ) .",
    "the third and fourth parts of this section show the predicted black hole abundances when intrinsic scatter in these relations is accounted for and when it is not .",
    "a detailed discussion of exactly how the black hole sample was compiled , as well as how we convert from b , v , r and i - band luminosities to sdss @xmath16band is provided in appendix  a of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "briefly , all luminosities and black hole mass estimates depend on distance : where necessary , these were computed by scaling results in the literature to @xmath17  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersions are , essentially , distance independent ( see bernardi et al .",
    "2007b for details ) .",
    "consider three observables which we will call @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath6 , with joint distribution @xmath19 . to make the discussion more concrete ,",
    "suppose that this joint distribution is gaussian , so that this distribution is completely specified by the means and variances of the three variables , and the three cross - correlation coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "these correlation coefficients are constrained to lie between @xmath23 , with a value of zero indicating no correlation .",
    "then the distribution of @xmath6 at fixed @xmath24 , with @xmath25 or @xmath18 , is gaussian with mean and variance @xmath26 let @xmath27 denote the result of predicting the distribution of @xmath6 from the distribution of @xmath24 by using @xmath28 to change variables from @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath27 is a gaussian centered on @xmath30 with rms = @xmath31 .",
    "unless @xmath32 , this value will be smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in general , ( i ) @xmath34 and ( ii ) both will be more sharply peaked than the true @xmath35 distribution .",
    "( in the limit @xmath36 , i.e. , the limit of no correlation between o and @xmath6 , @xmath27 becomes a delta function centered on the mean value ; this behaviour is the basis for the concept of ` shrinkage towards the mean ' which is common in discussions of bayesian statitical inference . ) hence , except in the case of perfect correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath24 , all choices of @xmath24 are biased ",
    "there is little reason to prefer the estimate from one observable over another .    on the other hand , although both @xmath37 and @xmath38 will underestimate the true distribution @xmath35 at large @xmath6 , the discussion above shows that the distribution of the observable which correlates more strongly with @xmath6 will be closer to the true @xmath35",
    ". in particular , at large @xmath6 , the cumulative distribution of the observable which correlates more strongly with @xmath6 will be closer to the true @xmath39 .",
    "so one might argue that the observable which predicts the largest @xmath27 at the largest @xmath6 is the one which is closest to yielding the true value .",
    "( of course , this is only true in an ideal world in which there are no systematic measurement errors . )    in effect , the procedure just described ignores the scatter around the mean @xmath28 relation . to include the effects of this scatter",
    "one must convolve @xmath40 with the distribution @xmath41 which has mean @xmath28 and rms @xmath42 : @xmath43 provided @xmath28 and @xmath42 are accurately known , it does nt matter what @xmath24 is , or how tightly correlated it is with @xmath6 .",
    "that is to say , predicting the distribution of @xmath6 from @xmath4 using the expression above should give the same ( correct ) answer as predicting it from @xmath18 .",
    "if this does _ not _ happen , i.e. , if the setting of @xmath25 gives a different answer than @xmath44 , then this is an indication that one or more of the @xmath41 relations are incorrect .",
    "this may happen , for instance , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are estimated from a different dataset from which the @xmath2 and @xmath47 correlations are estimated , since , if the datasets are not the same , then there is no guarantee that the joint @xmath48 distributions in the two datasets are the same .",
    "we argue below ( see section  3 ) that this appears to be the case : the @xmath49 correlation defined by the black hole samples in the literature differs from that in the sdss - b07 , which currently offers the best determinations of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and perhaps also @xmath49 ( see bernardi et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "the discussion above makes clear that , if @xmath24 is to predict @xmath6 , then the correlation of interest is @xmath28 .",
    "use of the ( inverse of the slope of the ) @xmath52 correlation for this purpose is clearly incorrect . for similar reasons",
    ", it is logically inconsistent to use fits to the @xmath53 correlation which treat @xmath6 and @xmath24 symmetrically , such as bisector or orthogonal fits .",
    "thus , although it is commonly used , the @xmath1 relation reported by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is _ not _ the appropriate choice for this problem .",
    "therefore , we have performed our own fits to the relations we require .",
    "the fitting procedure we use is described in the appendix , as are the results of fits to the hring & rix ( 2004 ) compilation .",
    "relation ( equation  a[mbhlum ] ) with the sdss luminosity function and ignoring ( dashed ) or including ( solid ) the effect of 0.33  dex scatter around the mean relation . in each case , bottom curve uses the sdss luminosity function of blanton et al . ( 2003 ) , and the top curve uses blanton et al . augmented with the bcg luminosities of hyde et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . ]      to estimate @xmath54 we need both @xmath55 and the distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "we use the @xmath56-band sdss luminosity function ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) as our basic function , augmented so that it includes a better estimate of the light from the most luminous galaxies .",
    "briefly , the sdss photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of bright galaxies in crowded fields and of nearby bright galaxies by more than @xmath57 mag ( bernardi et al .",
    "2007a ; lauer et al . 2007",
    "; hyde et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the main galaxy sample are biased low by @xmath58  mag ( see bernardi 2007 for a discussion of the systematics in the magnitudes and velocity dispersion in the sdss database and comparisons with the bernardi et al",
    ". 2003a sample ) . since these bright galaxies are likely to be massive galaxies , they are likely to host massive black holes , so it is important to correct for this bias .",
    "however , doing so is complicated by the fact that the light profiles of these objects are not standard .",
    "hyde et al . ( 2007 ) believe that the light profiles are the sum of two components ( a galaxy plus inter - cluster light ) , and only assign the light from the inner component to the object .",
    "( assigning all of the integrated surface brightness to the galaxy makes the discrepancies described below even larger . )    the effect of adding these objects to the luminosity function , and then transforming to a distribution of black hole masses using equation  ( a[mbhlum ] ) is shown by the dashed lines in figure  [ lbulge2bh ] .",
    "the effect at the luminous end is dramatic : blanton + hyde exceeds blanton alone by many orders of magnitude .",
    "these estimates of black hole abundances ignore the effects of intrinsic scatter in the @xmath2 relation .",
    "the solid curves in figure  [ lbulge2bh ] show the result of transforming to a distribution of black hole masses using equation  ( a[mbhlum ] ) and accounting for scatter of 0.33  dex using equation  ( [ scat ] ) . including the scatter increases the expected @xmath54 noticably at @xmath59 ; by @xmath60 ignoring the scatter results in an underestimate of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "in fact , blanton + scatter exceeds blanton + hyde at almost all @xmath6 . in this respect , accounting for scatter is more important than is getting details of the light profile correct .",

    "curves labeled blanton+hyde were obtained by combining the @xmath50 relation of equation  ( a[mbhlum ] ) with the observed distribution of luminosity from blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and hyde et al .",
    "the dashed curves assume there is no intrinsic scatter around the @xmath61 relations , whereas the hashed regions are bounded by curves in which the intrinsic scatter around the relation was assumed to be @xmath62  dex for @xmath51 , and @xmath63  dex for @xmath50 ( see appendix ) . ]",
    "figure  [ scat2bh ] shows the results of repeating this analysis , but now with @xmath64 and the distribution of velocity dispersions reported by sheth et al .",
    "( a word on this choice is necessary , since bernardi et al . 2006",
    "note that there may be more systems in the sdss with @xmath65  kms@xmath15 than the sheth et al .",

    "for ease of comparison with the luminosity function results shown in the previous subsection , we have used @xmath66 shown in the final figure of sheth et al.this adds an estimate of the contribution of spiral bulges to the measured distribution of early - type galaxy velocity dispersions . note that this makes essentially no difference at the massive end .",

    "the lowest dashed line in the figure shows the expected abundance of supermassive black holes if one ignores the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath64 relation , and the lower hashed region shows the predicted range if this scatter is between 0.16 and 0.28  dex ( i.e. @xmath68  dex , see appendix ) .",
    "the scatter clearly increases the expected numbers of massive black holes significantly . to appreciate the magnitude of the effect , the upper set of curves",

    "notice that the @xmath5-based prediction when scatter is included is similar to the @xmath4-based prediction when scatter is ignored .",
    "there is a small inconsistency here which we have investigated but which does not affect our main conclusion .",
    "namely , @xmath4 in the @xmath2 relations reported earlier refers to the bulge luminosity .",
    "whereas the bulge accounts for all the luminosity at large @xmath4 , it accounts for a decreasing fraction at lower @xmath4 .",
    "we have found that a crude model which sets @xmath71 , with @xmath72 yields bulge luminosity densities which are 40% of the total luminosity density in the @xmath73 and @xmath56-bands , in good agreement with current estimates . figure  [ modelbulges ] shows the result of incorporating this model for @xmath74 into our estimates of @xmath54 .",
    "doing so brings the @xmath4- and @xmath5-based estimates into good agreement at @xmath75 .",
    "however , since @xmath76 at large @xmath4 , the large differences at @xmath77 remain .",
    "the smaller intrinsic scatter around @xmath51 as compared to @xmath50 ( equations  a[mbhsigma ] and  a[mbhlum ] ) suggests that @xmath78 ( equation  [ var ] ) , so @xmath37 should predict more massive black holes than @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ scat2bh ] shows the opposite trend : the estimate based on the blanton et al .",

    "( 2003 ) velocity dispersion function .",
    "this is true even before adjusting the blanton et al .",
    "function upwards at large @xmath4 to account for bcgs .",
    "this indicates that something has gone wrong with the logic of the previous section .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the previous section suggested that , once scatter has been accounted for , both @xmath4- and @xmath5-based methods should give the same prediction .",
    "figures  [ scat2bh ] and  [ modelbulges ] show that the luminosity based predictions are still much larger than those based on velocity dispersion . in this respect ,",

    "( 2004 ) and marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who reported that , once scatter had been included , the two estimates agree . as we discuss below , this is because they made different choices for the shape and scatter of the @xmath6-observable correlations . whereas mclure & dunlop , and shankar et al .",
    "have approximately the same slope as equation  ( a[mbhlum ] ) , they are shifted to smaller zero - points .",

    "the errors in the slope and zero - point are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "note that this slope of @xmath112 is rather different from the canonical value of @xmath113 : at a given luminosity , the black hole samples have @xmath114 larger by about 0.08  dex than the sdss - b07observational errors are typically only about @xmath115  dex .",
    "yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) also considered the possibility that the @xmath3 relation was the cause of the discrepancy , and suggested that perhaps there are systematic differences between sdss - b07 velocity dispersions and those derived from more local samples .",
    "a direct test of this possibility is difficult because , of the @xmath105 objects in the hring & rix compilation , only about ten have sdss imaging , and only ncg 4261 has an sdss spectrum as well . for the objects in common , the sdss apparent magnitudes are about 0.5  mags fainter than those used in the black hole analyses , but this is almost certainly due to the sky subtraction problems for bright objects to which we refered earlier ( hyde et al .",
    "2007 ) . in any case , correcting for this will increase the sdss luminosities , further exacerbating the discrepancy in the @xmath3 relation .",

    "` sheth + bulges ' is the same as before , but ` blanton + hyde ' now produces many fewer massive objects . ]",
    "a detailed discussion of the @xmath3 relation computed from different samples , analysis of systematic biases which affect the samples , and the effect of correcting `` naively '' the nearby samples for peculiar velocities , is presented in bernardi ( 2007 ) .",
    "compared to any of these early - type galaxy samples , the @xmath3 relation in black hole samples is biased to larger @xmath5 for given @xmath4 , or to smaller @xmath4 for a given @xmath5 ( bernardi et al .",
    "in view of this discrepancy , whatever the cause , the fact that mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) , marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and shankar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtained consistent estimates of @xmath54 from both @xmath4 and @xmath5 is remarkable indeed .",
    "figure  [ wrongl ] shows the result of assuming that the velocity dispersion estimates in the black hole sample are reliable , but the distances , and so the luminosities , are not .",
    "it was constructed by rescaling all the bulge luminosities of the black hole hosts so that they define a relation with the same slope as in equation  ( [ sdssvl ] ) , though with different scatter .",
    "to do so , we added @xmath116 to each of the absolute magnitudes in the black hole sample , as suggested by the difference between equations  ( [ sdssvl ] ) and  ( [ bhvl ] ) .",
    "these rescaled luminosities were used to estimate a new @xmath69 relation , which was then inserted in equation  ( [ scat ] ) to predict black hole abundances from the luminosity function .",
    "the resulting abundances are considerably lower , because the rescaled luminosities define a considerably shallower @xmath69 relation , meaning that considerably larger @xmath4 is required to reach @xmath117 .",
    "while this rescaling is probably unrealistic , we have included the result to illustrate the importance of the @xmath3 relation when comparisons of the @xmath99 and @xmath101based estimates of @xmath54 are made .",
    "a more careful accounting of the role of selection effects is presented in bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "it is common to estimate the abundance of supermassive black holes by combining observed correlations between @xmath6 and bulge luminosity or velocity dispersion , calibrated from relatively small samples , with luminosity or velocity dispersion functions determined from larger samples .",
    "however , the @xmath51 and @xmath50 relations have intrinsic scatter of about 0.22 and 0.33  dex ( appendix ) . accounting for this results in considerably increased estimates of the abundance of black holes with @xmath9 , compared to naive estimates which ignore this scatter .",
    "doing so is at least as important as correcting the luminosity function for the fact that the most luminous galaxies have non - standard light profiles ( figure  [ lbulge2bh ] ) .",
    "once this scatter has been accounted for , the @xmath5-based estimates of @xmath54 are in reasonably good agreement with models , such as that of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which relate previous qso and agn activity to the local black hole mass function .",
    "the luminosity - based estimates , on the other hand , are substantially in excess of this model .",
    "these results follow from using a single power - law to parametrize the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations .",
    "while this may be too simplistic , this parametrization is not the primary reason why the @xmath99 and @xmath101based approaches yield different predictions for black hole abundances .",
    "the main cause of the discrepancy is that the @xmath3 correlation in black hole samples is different from that in the samples from which the luminosity and velocity functions are drawn : the black hole samples have larger @xmath5 for a given @xmath4 compared to the enear or sdss - b07 samples or have smaller @xmath4 for a given @xmath5 ( bernardi et al",
    ". 2007b ) .",
    "if this is a physical effect , then it compromises the fundamental assumption of black hole demographic studies  that all galaxies host black holes .",
    "if , on the other hand , it is a selection effect , then the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations currently in the literature are biased compared to the true relations , making current estimates of black hole abundances unreliable . if black hole masses correlate with bulge luminosity only because of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 relations , then the bias in the @xmath3 relation is not important only if one is using @xmath104 to infer black hole abundances : the @xmath45-based estimate may be strongly affected .    identifying the source of the bias",
    "is complicated .",
    "residuals from the size - luminosity relation are anti - correlated with residuals from the @xmath3 relation , as might be expected from the virial theorem ( bernardi et al .",
    "if the stellar kinematics method of measuring black hole masses favors objects with high surface brightnesses , then one might expect smaller sizes and larger @xmath5 at constant @xmath4 : this would produce a bias in the sense we see . on the other hand",
    ", it might be more difficult to measure the influence of the black hole on stellar kinematics if the stellar velocity dispersion is already abnormally large  this would produce a bias in the opposite sense .",
    "whether either or these effects has played a role in the selection of black samples is an open question .",
