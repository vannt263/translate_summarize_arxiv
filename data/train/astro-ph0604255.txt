    "reconstructions of the emission measure distribution of plasma , and the dependence of electron density , with temperature , n@xmath10(t@xmath10 ) , from high spectral resolution grating data give constraints on stellar coronal structure and heating .",
    "another motivation for a detailed investigation of the outer atmosphere of an m dwarf flare star lies in recent studies which suggest that the occurrence of flares may be frequent enough to supply the heating requirements of some stellar coronae ( * ? ? ? * but first put forth in @xcite ) .",

    "many flares were detected ; a separate paper @xcite discusses the flare observations .",
    "the focus of this paper is an investigation of ev  lac s quiescent atmospheric properties from x - ray to radio wavelengths .",

    "the array was moving from c to d configuration .",
    "the phase calibrator was 2255 + 420 , and the flux density calibrator was 0137 + 331 ( 3c 48 ) .",
    "the observations on 19 september 2001 were performed using the entire array , and frequency switched between 6 , 3.6 , and 2 cm ( 4.9 , 8.4 , and 15.0 ghz ) , for a total of 10 hours of observations . on 20 september ,",
    "the observing strategy changed : we observed simultaneously in two subarrays at 6 and 3.6 cm , to characterize the dual frequency behavior of any flares that might occur during the chandra observations .",
    "processing of the data was done in aips ( version 31 dec 03 ) .",
    "the field around ev  lac is crowded ; there is a large radio galaxy @xmath11 2.7 arcminutes away , and numerous radio sources .",

    "the data were acquired in time - tag mode to enable investigation of short time - scale variability at high spectral resolution .",
    "spectra were extracted in 60 second intervals to search for significant variability ; the order location solutions from the pipeline - processed data were used to extract spectra and assign wavelengths .",
    "the background and spectral extraction widths were 7 pixels , and the background was fit by a second order polynomial ; the background was then subtracted to obtain a net spectrum .",
    "we constructed a light curve by summing the background - subtracted counts in each 60 second spectrum , using poisson statistics to generate error bars .",
    "a quiescent spectrum was constructed by excluding times of flaring activity .",
    "the net quiescent exposure time was 10,320 seconds ( total exposure 10,920 s ) .",

    "times of obvious flaring were excluded .",
    "a net spectrum was extracted for the short wavelength ( sw ) and medium wavelength ( mw ) spectrometers , respectively .",
    "the net exposure time was 105ks for each spectrometer .",
    "inspection of the mw spectrum revealed the presence of two transitions of , at @xmath24 335.41 and @xmath24 360.76 , whose ratio can be used to constrain the column density of intervening interstellar hydrogen .",
    "previous high energy missions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the primary focus of the investigation was a unique 100 ks chandra observation , from 2001 september 19.821.0 .",
    "the observations were made using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in conjunction with the acis - s detector array .",
    "the hetgs provides an undispersed image of the object from 0.310 kev and spectra through two gratings : the medium - energy grating ( meg ) covering the wavelength range 1.731 in first order and the high energy grating ( heg ) covering the wavelength range 1.218.5 in first order , with almost twice the spectral resolution .",
    "processing the chandra data utilized ciao , version 2.2 , `` threads '' , i.e. , processing recipes , for different aspects of the data reduction .",
    "we eliminated bad aspect times and confirmed that the observation was not affected by acis `` background flares '' .",
    "the new acis pixel size ( 0.0239870 mm ) and focal length ( 10070.0 mm ) were updated in processing the acis events .",
    "events with energies less than 300 ev and greater than 10,000 ev were excluded , as these are not well - calibrated ; also excluded were events whose pulse - height invariant ( pi ) values were 0,1 , or 1024 ( overflow / underflow values ) .",
    "only asca grades 0,2,3,4,6 were kept .",
    "the events were resolved into spectral events using region filtering ( rectangles around the meg and heg stripes ) , and a level 2 event file was generated .",
    "one of the ccd chips in the acis - s array ( s4 ) suffered increased scatter ( streaking ) in the horizontal ( chipy ) direction , apparently caused by a flaw in the serial readout ; a destreak filter was applied to remove these data .",
    "updated sensitivity files were used to correct for contamination on the acis chip which affects sensitivity at low energies .",
    "we used custom idl procedures to determine light curve variations and subsequent spectral analysis .",
    "the level 2 events file was filtered for meg events falling within the spectral extraction window ( @xmath290.1 mm in the cross - diffraction coordinate ) .",
    "the first @xmath1140 ks of the observation were unaffected by flares ; the remaining 60 ks was characterized by numerous small enhancement events and a few high contrast , but short duration , events .",
    "a separate paper details the x - ray flare variations in context of the multi - wavelength nature of the monitoring campaign @xcite .",
    "little difference is apparent in the spectra of time intervals affected by small flares and those characterized by quiescence , so we extracted spectra corresponding to the sum of the initial quiescent period and a later interval marked by small enhancements ( flares 36 and 9 in the terminology of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for this study .",
    "the total exposure time of the extracted interval is 65 ks .",
    "the flare campaign described by @xcite focused on the large flare observed at 3.6 and 6 cm on 20 september 2001 . here",
    "we concentrate on the 19 september and quiescent part of the 20 september radio observations .",
    "flux and polarization parameters for the data on 19 september are listed in table  [ tbl : vla ] ; values for 20 september are listed in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiospec ] plots the flux and polarization spectra .",
    "in addition to determining the average flux density of the source at three frequencies on 19 september , we investigated the temporal variations to ensure that no large flare events occurred .",
    "we detect the source at 2 cm for the first time . the spectral index between 6 and 3.6 cm ( assuming s@xmath30 ) is @xmath310.11 ( 1@xmath32 ) , while between 3.6 and 2 cm it is @xmath330.18 ( 1 @xmath32 ) .",
    "the 6 and 3.6 cm circular polarization values are almost the same as the `` preflare '' values recorded on 20 september , and reported in @xcite , and the 3.6 cm fluxes are very similar as well .",
    "the largest variation is in the 6 cm flux on 19 and 20 september , but it is less than 30% .",
    "thus we have confidence that the quiescent conditions in the radio - emitting corona were at a characteristic level during all the observations described here .        the quiescent stis spectrum , characterized by bright emission lines , is shown in figure  [ fig : stisspect ] .",
    "we fit moderate and strong emission lines using a gaussian line profile analysis , convolving the line profile fit with the empirical line spread function to account for instrumental broadening appropriate for the aperture and grating .",
    "we use the laboratory wavelengths in the stellar rest frame , corrected for ev  lac s radial velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : stislines ] lists the derived velocities , widths , and fluxes .    in the case of @xmath241218 , we fitted the wing of h  ly@xmath17 as a second order polynomial to subtract and fit the line .",
    "the transition of @xmath241354 is blended with a transition , and requires careful modeling of the expected flux from the line to remove its influence on the profile .",
    "we used the line flux listed in @xcite , who included ev  lac in their survey .",
    "the contaminating influence of the transition is weak in this case , as estimates from simple gaussian fitting to the line profile are similar to those obtained from the more sophisticated approach .",
    "we fit the multiplet from 1174.91176.4   as the sum of six gaussians , with central wavelengths fixed to the laboratory values , and fwhm and amplitudes allowed to vary .",
    "we also checked that line ratios of transitions selected for use in emission measure analysis were consistent with the effectively thin flux ratios .",

    ". the observed ratio of @xmath241533.430/@xmath241526.706 is slightly lower than the effectively thin ratio , as is @xmath241175.713/@xmath241174.935 .",
    "this is consistent with trends reported in the sun and other stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the transitions share a common upper level so their ratio will depart from the optically thin values when there is opacity in the line  the deviation is that expected from line scattering in these systems .",
    "they can still be considered effectively thin if no photons are destroyed .",
    "the magnitude of the departures is small , and we use the total line fluxes to estimate the dem at these temperatures ( see  5.2 ) . for line profiles",
    "which were fit better by the sum of two gaussian line profiles , we compared the flux ratios of the narrow and broad components separately . for the and doublets , the flux ratio of each narrow component , as well as the flux ratio of each broad component , is consistent within the errors with the effectively thin flux ratio .",
    "the data were split into night - time and day - time data so that the effects of air - glow emission are recognizable .",
    "no obvious flaring was detected during the observation .",
    "the spectra containing the detected transition region emission lines are shown in figure  [ fig : fusespect ] .",
    "the only stellar lines detected are @xmath351031.9,1037.6 , the @xmath241175 multiplet and the @xmath24 977 resonance line , and the forbidden transition @xmath24974 . a comparison of the day - time and night - time spectra show that the lines and the intersystem multiplet are unaffected by airglow features .",
    "the day - time data for the 977   profile show the presence of significant scattered solar photons in the sic channels , which is not present during orbital night .",
    "since ev  lac is so near ( @xmath36pc ) , fuv reddening is likely to be small .",
    "emission line fluxes for these lines were measured by direct summation over the line profiles .",
    "no continuum signal was detected in the region of these lines .",
    "line fluxes of detected lines are listed in table  [ tbl : fuselines ] .",
    "the euv and x - ray spectra are dominated by lines of highly ionized iron , as well as bright lines arising from transitions of h- and he - like ions in the x - ray region ( figures  [ fig : euvespect ] and [ fig : chandraspec ] ) .",
    "these lines are well described as effectively thin transitions occurring in collisional ionization equilibrium . at the spectral resolution of the chandra hetgs ,",
    "the lines are unresolved ; in our analysis of the line profiles we assume a gaussian line profile shape with width fixed to the instrumental resolution ( 23 mfor meg , 11 m  for heg ) , and we solve for line flux and central wavelength .",
    "we generated a list of moderate to strong transitions in the hetg bandpass from the atomic linelists of the apec @xcite project to use for line fitting .",
    "widths of euve spectral line fits were kept fixed to the instrumental resolution : 0.38    for sw , 1.14   for mw .",
    "continuum processes , consisting of free - free , free - bound , and two - photon processes from several elements ( but dominated by h and he ) , can be non - negligible at high energies . as the continuum emission can be important in the euv spectral region , but difficult to disentangle from the numerous weak lines , we determined the expected amount of continuum emission in the euv spectral range using the scaling at x - ray wavelengths @xmath37 10   and subtracted this from the observed euv spectra to estimate continuum - free emission line fluxes .",
    "as discussed in  4 in more detail , we utilized a self - consistent treatment of line and continuum emission in order to make a first estimate of the dem and abundances , and determine euv / x - ray line fluxes without contribution from continuum emission for further analysis .",

    "only the stis and chandra spectra are strictly simultaneous ; the euve observation was made @xmath118 years earlier , the fuse observation @xmath1110 months later . in light of the dramatic variability of dme stars , it is worthwhile to check whether the state of the star is roughly the same in these three different pointings .",
    "we have made some initial cuts to exclude large flares , but smaller levels of variability may exist , and we address that here .",
    "the multiplet at @xmath241175 is present in both stis and fuse spectra , taken @xmath1110 months apart .",
    "the line fluxes in the fuse spectrum are @xmath381.6 times larger than the stis line fluxes .",
    "the ionization fraction of the ion is a maximum at a temperature @xmath38 9@xmath1210@xmath39 k. there is evidence for a small amount of variability in the upper chromospheric and transition region plasma .",
    "if the dem has changed slightly between these times , we could expect a difference of this magnitude .",
    "there are coronal transitions in the uv , fuv , euv , and x - ray whose observed fluxes can be compared against the emissivity ratios for the transitions , to quantify the level of variability at these different times . in the stis spectral range",
    "there is @xmath241354 , and @xmath24128.73 is detected by euve . in the fuse spectral range",
    "there is @xmath24974 , and @xmath2493.92 is detected by euve .",
    "the observed fluxes of these lines are compared against the brightest transitions of and detected in the chandra bandpass , to determine whether and how much ev  lac varied between the observations .",

    ". the emissivity ratios of these transitions have a range , due to their temperature dependence .",
    "since the observed flux is proportional to the emissivity times the dem , and it is possible that the dem has changed if the system is variable , we examine a range of emissivity ratios to gauge the extent of variability . by assuming that lines are formed over @xmath400.3",
    ", we calculate the range of emissivities expected .",
    "table  [ tbl : var ] lists the observed flux ( energy ) ratios , along with the emissivity ( energy ) ratios , over a temperature range of @xmath290.15 dex from t@xmath41 , the temperature at which the ionization fraction peaks .",
    "the observed flux ratios are consistent within the observational errors to the range expected from temperature variations within @xmath400.3 .",
    "based on the chromospheric and coronal line flux comparisons , we hereby assume that by analyzing these spectra as a whole we are diagnosing a characteristic state of ev  lac .      only the stis and fuse spectra have sufficient spectral resolution to perform line profile analysis .",
    "earlier work on active stars by @xcite showed that uv emission lines are often better described as the sum of two gaussians , and we follow this approach in our line profile analysis , comparing the statistical fit between a single gaussian and double gaussian .",
    "line profile parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : stislines ] for stis lines , and table  [ tbl : fuselines ] for fuse lines . in the case where two gaussians were the better fit ,",
    "we record the line profile parameters for each gaussian .",
    "there is a problem with the stis pipeline for timetag mode observations , in which the doppler shift is not correctly applied .",
    "the magnitude of the error is 3.8 pixels , or about 12 km s@xmath15 , and degrades the intrinsic resolution of the spectra .",
    "since our spectrum is accumulated over 4 orbits , we corrected for this effect by adding a gaussian of width 12 km s@xmath15 to the observed velocity width in quadrature to account for the decreased resolution .",
    "the observed line widths can then be expressed as the sum in quadrature of three velocities , + @xmath42 adapted from @xcite , where @xmath43 is the line profile fwhm in  , @xmath24 is the line center in  , @xmath44 is boltzmann s constant in erg k@xmath15 , @xmath45 is the temperature at which the ion s ionization fraction peaks in @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the ion mass in @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the most probable nonthermal velocity in km s@xmath15 , and @xmath50 is the instrumental broadening of 12 km s@xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vturb ] displays the trend of nonthermal velocity with formation temperature for the line profiles analyzed here .",
    "if the line profile can be divided into a narrow and a broad component , and the interpretation of the broad component is microflaring , then the `` quiet '' atmospheric structures should be considered apart from the microflaring effects .",
    "on the other hand , if the entire line profile can instead be described by a normal distribution of line widths ( as implied by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then the entire line flux should be used , since the emission is integrated over the disk of the star .",
    "we note that apart from @xmath241206 , the narrow components of the two gaussian fits are consistent with the thermal line widths .",
    "both lines in the fuse spectra are clearly skewed with the emission peak shifted shortward of the line centroid and with emission extending further in the longward wing than for the shortward wing .",
    "a single gaussian fits the bulk of the 1032   line profile reasonably and gives a line flux similar to that from direct integration with a line width ( fwhm ) of 0.16  , or 46 km s@xmath15 width .",
    "one of the highest temperature transitions in the stis spectra , , has one line profile ( @xmath241238 ) , statistically better fit by two gaussians , while the other line profile ( @xmath241242 ) is statistically better fit by one gaussian .",
    "lines from a resonance doublet are formed in a 2:1 ratio with same intrinsic line profile , so it is odd that only one transition shows evidence for two gaussians .",
    "we compare the line profiles in figure  [ fig : n5compare ] to examine the reality of the second gaussian in the @xmath241238 line . since this line is brighter than its sister transition by a factor of two , the absence of evidence for a second gaussian in the wings of the @xmath241242 line may simply reflect the poorer s / n ; the two gaussians which fit the @xmath241238 line are compatible with the flux - scaled @xmath24 1242 line profile .",
    "@xcite noted that the discrepancy between the widths of the @xmath51 $ ] intersystem line , a low opacity transition , and , which is a strong scattering line , in the active star hr  1099 suggests that these lines are not originating entirely from the same regions , despite the fact that the temperatures at which the lines are formed are nearly identical . in contrast , the widths of narrow component features in ev  lac are similar to those deduced from single - gaussian fits to other transitions sharing the same formation temperature , indicating that the two are likely formed in the same regions and not subject to any strong scattering effects .    in the solar transition region",

    "@xcite studied the statistical distribution of coronal flares and their effect on the distribution of plasma with temperature in the corona , under the assumption that the coronal heating could be accounted for entirely by a superposition of flares proceeding to smaller and smaller energies ( the so - called `` nanoflare heating hypothesis '' ) . following the arguments outlined in their section 6.4",

    "we investigated the temporal variability in the x - ray observation to examine whether there was any difference in behavior of high temperature and low temperature coronal plasmas , as might be observed if the high temperature component were due to a superposition of flaring activity .",

    "these values are consistent with the equipartition magnetic field strengths required to magnetically confine the hot coronal plasma at temperatures @xmath88 mk discussed in  6.1 and thus lend some credence to the existence of such strong magnetic fields in the corona .",
    "we emphasize , though , that these estimates are made for a homogeneous source .",
    "we estimate the optically thick emission due to gyroresonance emission following equation ( 5 ) in @xcite as + @xmath163 for a heliocentric distance of 5 pc . assuming an optically thick source size equal to 1.1 times the stellar radius of @xmath38 0.3 r@xmath16",

    "this is higher than the observed flux density at 15 ghz and so is not consistent with the soft x - ray emitting source being spatially coincident with the radio - emitting source .",
    "thus the high frequency radio emission is not consistent with being explained completely by gyroresonance emission , but spatial inhomogeneities in radio and/or soft x - ray ( sxr ) emitting regions may be account for some of the discrepancies .    for gyrosynchrotron emission from a homogeneous population of mildly relativistic electrons described by a power - law distribution in energy ,",
    "the optically thin spectral index @xmath17 can be related to the index of the power law , @xmath155 , by @xmath165 @xcite . for a relatively hard distribution with @xmath166 , @xmath1670.59 ,",
    "which is consistent with the 3.62 cm spectral index .",
    "however , the total integrated energy does not converge for such a hard electron distribution .",
    "if the radio emission is not completely optically thin at one or both of these frequencies ( or includes contributions from gyroresonance emission , see paragraph above ) , this could lead to our inferred @xmath155 being smaller than the actual @xmath155 ; thus we explore the effect of @xmath168 in the following simple models of the magnetic geometry .",
    "constraints on coronal properties can be obtained by using simple analytic models , and a radial decrease in the number of nonthermal particles .",
    "we use the analytic formulae of @xcite , who parameterized spatial inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and nonthermal number density distribution .",
    "@xcite considered a global dipole , which they termed a `` bare '' dipole , and a `` buried dipole '' , in which the depth below the surface at which the dipole is buried is much less than a stellar radius .",
    "the parameter @xmath169 describes the power - law index of the radial dependence of the number density .",
    "the @xmath170 case corresponds to a nonthermal electron distribution independent of radius , appropriate for an isotropic pitch angle distribution .",
    "the other extreme , @xmath171 , corresponds to the radial dependence of the electrons being the same as that of the dipolar magnetic field ; this is the situation that would be obtained by conserving both particle and magnetic flux in the case of open field lines .    by constraining the index of the power - law distribution to be @xmath168 , we explored possible scenarios , including a global and buried dipole , the radial dependence of the nonthermal electron energy ( either constant with radius , or having the same radial dependence as the magnetic field ) , the base magnetic field strength , and the total number density of accelerated electrons above a cutoff value .    for @xmath168 and an observed flux density s@xmath172 , the magnetic field strength at the base of the dipole and the total number density of nonthermal electrons",
    "are related as @xmath173 .",
    "the frequency at which the spectrum turns over is also a strong function of the magnetic field strength in the source .",
    "m dwarf radio spectra are consistent with a rising spectrum between 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz , and flat or declining flux density spectra at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ radiotau ] displays allowed regions of @xmath153 and @xmath154 which produce the flux density at 15 ghz to within a factor of two , and have a spectral turnover between 2 and 8 ghz , to constrain some of the radio coronal properties of ev lac .",
    "there is very little difference between the @xmath170 and @xmath174 models for a bare dipole .",
    "these models imply a relatively large base magnetic field strength and low value of total nonthermal electron density .",
    "we note that the magnetic field that @xcite observed on ev  lac is almost certainly not a global dipole field : polarization from optical observations is discussed explicitly in @xcite where the authors argue that ad  leo s field is not a global dipole .",
    "thus we considered dipoles buried at smaller depths , which would be characteristic of individual active regions .",
    "for a dipole buried to 0.2r@xmath98 the base magnetic field strength can be relatively small ( @xmath175 100 g ) , but with a larger total nonthermal electron density ( @xmath176 10@xmath56 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength data described here pose a conundrum : the soft x - ray ( sxr ) observations require large magnetic field strengths in the hot corona to confine the plasma , but the radio observations do not support such large fields in the corona providing a significant amount of gyroresonant opacity .",
    "these two observations can be reconciled if the radio and sxr emission regions are not coincident .",
    "this conclusion was reached by previous authors who determined @xcite that the hot component of the sxr - emitting plasma was not coincident with the strong magnetic fields in the low corona , and @xcite who estimated that the hot coronal material must be co - spatial with coronal magnetic fields less than 0.51 kg .",
    "the results described in this paper represent the first attempt at a realistic investigation of the problem , using high spectral resolution observations to determine the shape of the continuous emission measure distribution and place constraints on the electron density at several temperatures in the outer atmosphere of an active m dwarf .",
    "the coronal electron density determinations place an additional constraint : any radio emission from the high temperature , high density soft x - ray - emitting material is below the local plasma frequency ( @xmath177 ghz ) and therefore can not propagate . for n@xmath17810@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath17929 ghz",
    "so the electromagnetic wave is damped .",
    "this is an additional argument that the high temperature x - ray emitting plasma can not be spatially coincident with the centimeter - wavelength radio emission .",
    "the volumes derived from the emission measure analysis imply remarkably compact coronal structures : for spherically symmetric coronal emission , v @xmath710@xmath141 @xmath3 and ev  lac s radius , the coronal extent is less than 0.1 r@xmath98 .",
    "we estimate the filling factors for sxr and radio emission using our observations . for soft x - ray emission , we compare the observed @xmath180 ( deduced from vem and @xmath88 in  5.2 ) with the volume available for a spherically symmetric volume @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the height of the emission above the stellar photosphere and deduce a filling factor @xmath183 , + @xmath184 and we relate @xmath182 to the loop length @xmath116 by @xmath185 .",

    "this is consistent with the other significantly different plasma characteristics of the low- and high - temperature corona discussed above .",
    "we thus derive two filling factors , for the @xmath112.5 mk plasma ( ltc ) and @xmath11 8mk ( htc )  + @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the loop lengths for the low- and high - temperature coronal plasma , respectively . filling factors of order unity",
    "are returned if loop lengths @xmath191few @xmath1210@xmath104 cm , whereas dramatically smaller length scales are needed to obtain near unity filling factor for the high temperature coronal plasma .",
    "conversely , this seems to indicate a much smaller than unity filling factor for the high temperature coronal plasma .",
    "an equivalent argument can also be made using the temperature gradient determined in  6.3 ( equation 17 ) and determining a length scale @xmath192 , + @xmath193 in which case for filling factor of unity , the loop length must be @xmath194 .",
    "we also estimate the filling factor for radio emission by using the results of resolved radio sizes from vlbi studies @xcite , and compare this with the volume deduced from optically thin emission , where @xmath195 , @xmath196 is the radio luminosity , and @xmath197 is the emissivity for gyrosynchrotron emission , taken from @xcite .",

    "we hereby assume that this is also a characteristic radio emission length scale for ev  lac .",
    "the total radio - emitting volume is then @xmath201=@xmath202 , with @xmath200 the resolved height of radio emission above the stellar radius .",
    "the observed radio- emitting volume is estimated from the radio luminosity and emissivity at 8.5 ghz ( 3.6 cm ) . the filling factor for gyrosynchrotron emission at 3.6 cm",

    "is unphysical , and thus appears to be in agreement with the optical polarization limits ruling out a global dipolar component .",
    "the results of this section and  6 imply different length scales for the cool and hot sxr - emitting plasma  the low temperatures should be more extended and therefore undergo more rotational modulation .",
    "the radio source is also inhomogeneous , with scale lengths larger than the expanded , low temperature coronal material , which would place the radio spectral results in agreement with the soft x - ray constraints .",
    "the radio source is also likely not coincident with the large field strengths inferred from optical observations , as the equatorial surface fields estimated from the simple dipole field geometry for gyrosynchrotron emission are in the range @xmath1130500 g , and the filling factor times field strength derived from @xcite and @xcite are @xmath114 kg . the high temperature corona , from dem arguments in  6.4.1 , is likely related to a flare heating process .",
    "the high pressures derived for this plasma also imply that it is the most compact , with the smallest timescales for energy loss and the largest energy loss rates .",

    "if the flare process which heats plasma to high temperatures also involves the acceleration of particles , then there should be a link between radio emission from accelerated electrons and high temperature coronal plasma  although from the arguments above the two populations can not be spatially coincident .",
    "the high angular resolution and temperature discrimination of narrow - band filters available on the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) have been instrumental in making advances in understanding of solar coronal loop structures , heating and dynamics .",
    "euv - emitting loops have temperatures generally from 0.81.6 mk , and thus are cooler than the temperatures discussed in this paper , but nevertheless the detail with which they have been investigated motivates this as a starting point for comparison .",

    "thus there is the potential for misinterpretation of the data if this effect is not resolved , and the pessimistic prospect for future uv spectroscopic missions means astronomers will be relying heavily on already obtained archival data .    based on observed electron densities and emission measure distributions , the timescale for upper atmospheric material to lose energy is short , requiring significant continued heating .",
    "calculations of analytic expressions for radiative and conductive loss rates show that a large amount of energy is being lost at high temperatures , which argues for an enhanced amount of energy input at the highest coronal temperatures .",
