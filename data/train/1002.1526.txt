    "the gas temperature is considerably higher than the dust temperature ( @xmath7 k ; pierce - price et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that a gas heating process unrelated to ultraviolet radiation is working there .",

    "1998 ) and complex organic molecules ( coms ; requena - torres et al .",
    "2006 ) are common in the cmz .",
    "these suggest that interstellar shock pervades over the cmz .",
    "the origin of pervasive shock is still unclear . although theories of large - scale shocks caused by orbit crowding ( rodrguez - fernndez et al . 2006 ) or magnetic floatation",
    "( fukui et al . 2008 ) can describe it , the other possibilities can not be ruled out .",
    "a ` classical ' interpretation , the accumulation of small - scale shocks by supernova explosions , might be able to contribute as well , however .",
    "about fifteen years ago , we have made a large - scale co _",
    "j_=10 survey of the galactic center region using the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45 m telescope ( oka et al .",
    "this survey completely covers the cmz and the clump 2 ( bania 1977 ) with a 34  grid spacing .",
    "high - resolution co images have shown that the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas are highly complex , and that the morphology is characterized by filamentary structures and by a number of shells and/or arcs .",
    "some of the shells / arcs show clear expanding motion , and two of them , an expanding barrel adjacent to the nonthermal vertical filaments of the radio arc ( oka et al 2001b ) and an expanding arc in the galactic - north of sgr b1 ( tanaka et al 2009 ) , have already been reported and discussed in separate papers .",
    "the most important result of the nro 45 m co _ j_=10 survey may be the discovery of high - velocity compact clouds ( hvccs ) . at present , this population of molecular clouds is peculiar to the central region of our galaxy .",
    "hvccs are defined by their compact sizes and large velocity widths , which lead to their short expansion times and enormous kinetic energies .",
    "two energetic hvccs , co 0.020.02 ( oka et al .",
    "1999 ) and co 1.27 + 0.01 ( oka et al .",
    "2001c ) have been studied in details .",
    "we developed an identification scheme of hvccs and identified 84 hvccs in the co _",

    "they spread over the cmz and clump 2 , but very few in the 200-pc molecular ring ( kaifu et al .",
    "1972 ; scoville 1972 ) . some of them are isolated , but most of them are associated with giant molecular clouds .",
    "the size versus velocity - width plot for hvccs is well apart from the best - fit lines for normal galactic center clouds and for clouds in the galactic disk , indicating that they belong to a category different from normal clouds .",
    "their kinetic energies range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 erg , and about 2/3 of them exceed @xmath11 erg .",
    "these characteristics of hvccs suggest that each of them have been formed by local explosive events , possibly a series of supernovae or hypernovae .",
    "therefore , energetic ones must be associated with massive stellar clusters .",
    "in fact , an energetic hvcc co 0.020.02 is associated with an emission cavity , which contains a group of mid - infrared point - like sources ( oka et al .",
    "these hvccs must be important targets not only because they have peculiar characteristics , but also because they could be related to the origin of pervasive shock , which is responsible for turbulence activation and gas heating in the cmz .",
    "in addition , they could be an indirect tracer of massive stellar clusters which are severely veiled in dense dusty material .",
    "since 2005 , we have been performing a large - scale co _ j_=32 ( 345.795989 ghz ) survey of the galactic center region using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",

    "two of them have been researched in more details :      in the sgr a region , we notice an ellipse in the longitude - velocity map .",

    "we know the upper part of the cnd is in near side ( e.g. , karlsson et al .",
    "if we assume the continuity between the high 32/10  disk and the cnd , the radial motion of the disk should be infalling .",
    "the mass of the high 32/10  disk is @xmath32 .",
    "the rotation velocity of the disk is about 110  and the infall velocity is 3060 . thus the infall timescale is comparable to the rotation period , indicating this disk must be transient .    .",

    "two expanding shells , which have been identified in the co _",
    "j_=10 data ( co 1.27 + 0.01 ; oka et al .",
    "2001c ) , appear as a high 32/10  clump .",
    "we have made follow - up observations of this region using the nro 45 meter telescope ( tanaka et al .",
    "we detected intense , high - velocity hcn and hco@xmath37 emission from this region , and found at least 9 expanding shells of dense molecular gas .",
    "we also detected three isolated sio clumps in the velocity ends of the expanding shells .",
    "each of the expanding shell has a kinetic energy of @xmath38 erg , and an expansion time of @xmath39 yrs .",
    "the total kinetic energy amounts to @xmath40 erg .",
    "the association of dense / hot gas and sio clumps and the enormous kinetic energy of the expanding shells ensure that they are generated by a series of supernova explosions , suggesting that a microburst of star formation has occurred there in the recent past .",
    "the situation is similar to those of molecular superbubbles found in nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "for instance , molecular superbubbles in ngc 253 have kinetic energies of @xmath40 erg , and ages of @xmath41 myr ( sakamoto et al .",
    "this indicate that the @xmath30 region may be in an early stage of superbubble formation ( ` _ proto - superbubble _ ' ) .",
    "we found a candidate of another proto - superbubble in the @xmath31 region , which should be investigated in more details .",
    "in addition to the high 32/10  clumps , we also found a number of small spots of high 32/10  gas over the cmz and clump 2 . many coincide with hvccs , the other appear as high - velocity wings emanating from giant molecular clouds , suggesting that they are shocked molecular gas .",
    "however , the spatial correlation with hvccs is not excellent . in other words ,",
    "not all hvccs contain large fraction of high 32/10  gas . the total _",
    "j_=32/_j_=10 intensity ratio of hvccs ranges from 0.4 to 2.2 .",
    "this variety of 32/10  could be due to evolution , or due to different origins of hvccs .",
    "apparently , more research is necessary to solve this problem .",
    "except for the sgr a and g 0.9 + 0.1 regions , high 32/10  gas in the galactic center region seems to be predominantly shocked molecular gas . since the spatial distribution of high 32/10  gas is spotty and clumpy , its origin should be local explosive events , most likely supernova explosions .",
    "star formation activity in the recent past can be examined by the current supernova rate .",
    "if each hvcc has been formed by a series of supernova explosions , it must be associated with a stellar cluster severely veiled in dense molecular material .",
    "age of such cluster must be younger than 30 million years , which is the main - sequence lifetime of an 8 @xmath42 star . assuming that each cluster was formed by a microburst of star formation , and assuming a salpeter - type initial mass function ( @xmath43 ; figer et al .",
    "1999 ) , we can estimate a cluster mass using the kinetic energy and expansion time of a hvcc .",
    "the mass of currently dying stars was assumed to be 15 @xmath42 .",
    "the estimated cluster mass ranges from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the conversion efficiency to the kinetic energy .",
    "note that some of them are very massive , exceeding @xmath47 .          can supernova shocks contribute to turbulence activation and gas heating in the cmz ? here we consider the energy flow from large - scale to small - scale ( tanaka et al . 2009 ) .",
    "first , the energy injection rate by supernovae are estimated from kinetic energies and expansion times of hvccs , to be @xmath48 erg / s .",
    "second , the turbulence dissipation rate can be estimated from the typical velocity width ( @xmath49 ) and size ( @xmath50 ) of molecular clouds in the cmz , to be @xmath51 erg / s . and",
    "third , the gas cooling rate can be approximated by the cooling rate by co rotational lines ( goldsmith &  langer 1978 ) . using a set of canonical values for the cmz , @xmath52 @xmath6 , @xmath53 k , @xmath54 pc ( km s@xmath18)@xmath18 , we had @xmath55 erg / s .",
    "these three values are comparable , and @xmath56 , suggesting that supernova shocks responsible for the hvcc formation can make significant contributions to turbulence activation and gas heating in the cmz .",
    "our aste co _ j_=32 survey have revealed the distribution and kinematics of highly - excited gas in the galactic center region . we found a large infalling disk of high 32/10  gas in the sgr a region , a candidate of proto - superbubble in the @xmath57 region , and a number of high 32/10  spots spreading over the cmz and clump2 .",
    "high 32/10  gas in the galactic center region seems to be predominantly shocked molecular gas .",
    "the results also have revealed the nature of hvccs .",
    "the majority of hvccs may have been formed by supernova explosions , and thus they must be associated with stellar clusters veiled in dense molecular material .",
    "cluster mass ranges from @xmath58 to @xmath45 . in the near future",
    ", relatives of hvcc will be found in centers of nearby galaxies with the atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "rough estimates of energy injection rate , turbulence dissipation rate , and gas cooling rate gave comparable values , suggesting that supernova shocks responsible for the formation of hvccs can provide significant contributions to turbulence activation and gas heating in the cmz .",
