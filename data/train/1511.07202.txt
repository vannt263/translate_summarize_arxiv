    "noise induced by the environment has been for decades considered the major enemy of quantum technologies .",
    "it is nowadays recognised that this initial belief was wrong @xcite .",
    "not only can noise be used to generate quantum properties such as entanglement @xcite , but also the dynamics of an open system , e.g. , its coherence time , can be modified by reservoir engineering . generally , there are a number of ways to change the properties of the environment in a selective and controllable way .",
    "typical examples are modifications of the spectral density of the electromagnetic field acting as an environment , such as in cavity quantum electrodynamics or photonics band gap materials @xcite , and dynamical decoupling methods @xcite .",
    "these techniques are nowadays routinely performed in the laboratories @xcite .    at the same time , the experimental ability to isolate from the environment and coherently control individual qubits in solid state systems such as nv centres in diamonds @xcite and superconducting josephson junctions @xcite has made them ideal candidates for quantum technologies . however , despite the advances of the last decade , the effects of noise in these systems still needs to be taken into account to study their robustness , efficiency , and life - time in realistic physical conditions .    the rising importance of both reservoir engineering techniques and solid state qubits highlights the need to investigate open quantum systems models which go beyond the markovian approximation usually used in quantum optics . during the last few years research on non - markovian dynamics",
    "has flourished .",
    "the study of memory effects , characterising non - markovian systems , has been linked with a partial revival of information on the open system @xcite .",
    "several ways to quantify information flow and back - flow have been proposed in order to understand the physical phenomena underlying non - markovian evolution @xcite .",
    "finally , intense research activity is currently focussed on the understanding of the conditions and the potential advantages of memory effects to enhance the performance of quantum devices @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty when dealing with non - markovian models is the lack of a general theorem which guarantees the physicality of the state as time evolves . from a mathematical point of view ,",
    "one of the reasons why markovian master equations have been so popular is indeed the existence of the gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ( gksl ) theorem characterising completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) dynamical maps @xcite .",
    "this in turn guarantees that , in absence of initial system - environment correlations , the time evolution of any quantum state of the open system , as described by the solution of the gksl master equation , is always physical .    because of this difficulty , dealing with generalised non - markovian master equations is always a tricky business @xcite . even for a single qubit , where conditions for complete positivity are known @xcite , all studies of non",
    "- markovianity have mostly focused on very simple models for which an exact solution of the total , i.e. , system plus environment , dynamics is available @xcite .",
    "this indeed guarantees physicality by construction .",
    "typical examples are the purely dephasing model @xcite , the pauli channel model @xcite and the amplitude damping model @xcite .",
    "the latter one goes beyond unital dynamics but is restricted to the case in which the two - state system dissipatively interacts with a zero - temperature reservoir .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the existing literature in several ways .",
    "firstly , we solve and study the cptp conditions of a generic time - local master equation which contains heating , dissipation and pure dephasing terms .",
    "this allows to assess the question of additivity of noise under non - markovian dynamics , extending the results of ref .",
    "secondly , we discuss the effects of temperature in a non - unital model which , in the markovian limit , gives the standard markovian master equation for a two - level atom interacting with a thermal bath .",
    "finally , we show that , as one might expect , the occurrence of non - markovianity now has a more complicated origin being linked to both the dephasing and the dissipative terms .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the general time - local master equation , present its solution , and show that the noise additivity property holds beyond the markovian approximation . in sec .",
    "iii we study the complete positivity conditions , while in sec .",
    "iv we introduce a heuristic master equation which is always physical and discuss the interplay between temperature effects and non - markovianity . finally in sec .",
    "v we present conclusions .",
    "let us consider the following time - local master equation for the qubit density matrix @xmath0 in the interaction picture and in units of @xmath1 , @xmath2 + \\frac{\\gamma_1 ( t)}{2 } l_1 ( \\rho ) + \\frac{\\gamma_2 ( t)}{2 } l_2(\\rho ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\gamma_3(t)}{2 } l_3(\\rho ) , \\label{eq : me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are time - dependent rates , @xmath4 is a time - dependent frequency shift , and the dissipators @xmath5 are defined as @xmath6 in the equations above @xmath7 are the inversion operators and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the pauli operators .",
    "the three dissipators @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , describe heating , dissipation and dephasing , respectively .",
    "however , contrarily to the typical gksl master equation @xcite , the decay rates are not positive constants but time - dependent functions which need not be positive at all times .",
    "the master equation describes phase covariant noise and has been considered recently in the context of quantum metrology in noisy channels @xcite .",
    "special cases of master equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) are those considered , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath13 describing an amplitude damping model , and the pure dephasing master equation considered , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath14 .",
    "these two special cases can be derived by means of an exact approach starting from a microscopic hamiltonian model for system and environment .",
    "hence the resulting dynamics is always cptp . in the more general case considered in this paper , however ,",
    "the master equation is introduced phenomenologically , since an exact microscopic derivation is unfeasible . as a consequence ,",
    "restrictions on the form of the time - dependent decay rates arise in order to preserve the cptp character of the dynamics .",
    "the master equation is one of the most general time - local master equations for a qubit .",
    "indeed , it combines the effects of pure dephasing terms and dissipative terms .",
    "the dynamics is non - unital and the heating term @xmath10 accounts for the presence of a finite temperature environment .",
    "the corresponding dynamical map can be written as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the chronological ordering operator .",
    "whenever one of the time - dependent rates takes negative values then the dynamical map is not cp - divisible , i.e. , the propagator @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , is not cp . in the following we define as markovian a dynamics such that @xmath17 is cp @xmath20 .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath21 and @xmath22 the ground and excited states of the qubit , respectively . from eq .",

    "more precisely one obtains the following markovian limits for the quantities defined in eqs . - .",
    "@xmath29 using these expressions one can recover the well known markovian formulas for populations and coherences @xmath30 the approximated gksl master equation , obtained from eq . by simply replacing the time - dependent coefficients with the corresponding positive constants , has been investigated , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite to study additivity of noise in the markovian limit and for @xmath31 .",
    "there the authors show that , while for a single qubit additivity holds , composite systems may violate this property . in the single qubit case",
    ", additivity simply means that the decay rates of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , when the qubit is subjected to independent sources of noise , is just the sum of the decay rates arising from the interaction with each individual environment .",
    "this is straightforwardly seen in eq . .",
    "in this paper we generalise the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of general temperatures and beyond the markovian approximation .",
    "equation , indeed , straightforwardly proves that additivity holds for the general time - local master equation , provided that the solution is physical . in the following section we will thoroughly investigate the conditions under which the master equation gives rise to a physically admittable dynamics described by a cptp map and we will give examples of both physical and unphysical behaviour for specific choices of the time - dependent decay rates .",

    "is always non - negative .",
    "we also stress that the dephasing term described by @xmath12 directly influences only conditions @xmath47 via the decoherence term @xmath48 .",
    "finally we note that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are sufficient conditions for positivity , i.e. , for @xmath45 .",
    "let us focus on the case in which the purely dephasing term vanishes , namely @xmath51 .",

    "we conclude this section by looking at the weak coupling and short time limits . in the weak coupling limit",
    "the following approximations hold @xmath58 using these approximations a straightforward calculation shows that conditions @xmath45 and @xmath52 correspond to @xmath59    as for the short - time approximation , by considering the taylor expansion around @xmath60 of the exponential terms , i.e. , @xmath56 and of the term @xmath61 , it is easy to convince oneself that the cp conditions amount at @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "these conditions imply that , contrarily to what happens in certain unital time - local master equations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in our model the decay rates can not take at the initial time negative values .",
    "let us now consider the following heuristic model .",
    "we assume that the open quantum system of interest is coupled to both a thermal reservoir and a dephasing environment at the same temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the former one induces heating and dissipation at rates given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the mean number of excitations in the modes of the thermal environment .",
    "we notice that , for a zero @xmath16 environment , the heating rate @xmath68 while the dissipation rate @xmath69 .",
    "hence , we consider as a possible physically reasonable choice for the time - dependent function @xmath70 the one obtained in the exactly solvable zero-@xmath16 model presented , e.g. , in ref .",

    "the coefficient @xmath75 can be analytically calculated and yields the simple expression @xmath76 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\equiv & -\\ln [ x(t)^{2n+1 } ] , \\label{eq : example}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq . and defined @xmath77 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "one obtaines the following analytic expression for the ground state population @xmath87 it is straightforward to verify that , for this model , the positivity conditions @xmath45 are verified at all times and for all values of @xmath88 .",
    "we notice that , in absence of the pure dephasing term , i.e. , whenever @xmath51 , condition @xmath52 is automatically satisfied and the corresponding @xmath16-temperature master equation is always physical . moreover , not only this model by construction reduces to the exact zero-@xmath16 model , but it also gives the correct markovian limit for a two - level system in a thermal bath at @xmath16 temperature .",
    "indeed , if we indicate with @xmath89 the markovian limit of @xmath83 in the exact zero-@xmath16 model , one can easily see that , the markovian expressions of the decoherence factor @xmath56 and of the ground state probability @xmath90 , obtained for @xmath91 , read @xmath92 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "we now go back to the situation in which the pure dephasing term is present in the liouvillian .",
    "the coefficient @xmath93 does not influence the behaviour of the populations . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the time evolution of the ground state population @xmath90 as a function of time for different temperatures , i.e. @xmath67 , in both the markovian case , fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , and the non - markovian case , fig . 1 ( b ) . we notice that , for @xmath94 and for increasing values of temperature , the oscillations in ground state population are quickly damped , even if the dynamics continues to be non - markovian because both the @xmath82 and the @xmath83 decay rates take negative values .",
    "hence , the presence of oscillations in the ground or excited state probability is not just connected to the markovian or non - markovian character of the dynamics , as it was for the exact model of ref .",
    "@xcite , but depends also on the temperature of the environment .",
    "we now consider the effect of the pure dephasing term . as done before",
    ", we will again use a model of pure dephasing which arises from an exact microscopic description @xcite . in this case the analytic expression for the dephasing rate is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the boltzmann constant and the spectral density is assumed to be of the ohmic class @xmath97 with @xmath98 an overall coupling constant and @xmath99 the cutoff frequency .",
    "it is worth stressing that this model always leads to @xmath100 , hence the dynamics is not only positive but also completely positive since condition @xmath52 is verified at all times . in ref .",
    "@xcite the non - markovianity of this model was studied in detail and was found to be linked to the value of the ohmicity parameter @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the two parameters governing the markovian to non - markovian crossover are @xmath74 and @xmath101 . in other words , the dynamics of the whole system",
    "can be non - markovian also for values of @xmath102 provided that the ohmicity parameter is such that @xmath103 for certain time intervals .    generally , the dynamics of the coherences , given by eq .",
    ", will be damped because of both the heating / dissipation terms and the dephasing term .",
    "we notice however , that some of the characteristic phenomena typical of pure dephasing in ohmic - like environments , e.g. , coherence trapping @xcite , will not occur in this model because the coefficient @xmath104 will always eventually erase the coherences and drive the system towards a thermal mixed state .",
    "we have solved and investigated the dynamics of a general time - local master equation which combines dissipative and pure dephasing terms showing that decoherence is still additive . guided from the knowledge of the exact microscopic amplitude damping and pure dephasing master equations ,",
    "we have introduced an intuitive heuristic model which is always cptp .",
    "this model allows us to study the effects of finite temperature on the dynamics of the qubit in the non - markovian regime . as expected , when increasing the temperature of the environment , decay of both populations and coherences is faster and faster .",
    "moreover , thermalisation destroys phenomena such as coherence trapping which are present in purely dephasing systems .",
    "we have pointed out that the conditions for non - markovian dynamics are now dependent on both the characteristic parameter of the dissipative terms , @xmath74 , and on the corresponding parameter for the pure dephasing term , @xmath101 .",
    "finally we have seen that finite temperature effects quickly destroy the oscillatory behaviour of populations even in the strongly non - markovian regime @xmath94 .",
    "given the importance of studies of fundamental non - markovian models , we believe that our results will be of use for both reservoir engineering and to model noise in solid - state devices in realistic experimental conditions , i.e. , when finite - temperature effects can not be neglected . as an example ,",
    "an interesting future direction is the investigation of whether and how memory effects may affect the break down of additivity property in bipartite systems , as it happens in the markovian case @xcite .",
