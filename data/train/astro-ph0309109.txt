    "the argo - ybj detector , currently under construction at the yangbajing laboratory ( p.r .",
    "china , 4300 m a.s.l . ) , is a full coverage array of dimensions @xmath0 realized with a single layer of rpcs .",
    "the area surrounding this central detector ( _ carpet _ ) , up to @xmath1 , is partially ( @xmath2 ) instrumented with other rpcs .",
    "the basic element is the logical _ pad _ ( @xmath3 ) which defines the time and space granularity of the detector .",
    "the layout of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "the detector is subdivided in 6 @xmath4 2 rpc units ( clusters , the rectangles of fig .",
    "[ argo ] ) .",
    "showers of sufficiently large size will trigger the detector even if their core is located outside its boundaries .",
    "the corresponding core positions are generally reconstructed not only near the carpet edges but also well inside them . as a consequence , sofisticated algorithms to reduce the contamination of external events are needed .",
    "the goal is to identify and reject a large fraction of external events before exploiting any reconstruction algorithm only by using some suitable parameters .",
    "the rejection of external events is important because a large difference between the true and the reconstructed shower core position may lead to a systematic miscalculation of some shower characteristics , such as the shower size .",
    "moreover , an accurate determination of the shower core position for selected internal events is important to reconstruct the primary direction using conical fits to the shower front , improving the detector angular resolution or to performe an efficient gamma / hadron discrimination .    in this paper",
    "we present a reconstruction procedure able to identify and reject a large fraction of showers with core outside the argo - ybj detector .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure is investigated both for gamma and proton induced showers .",
    "to perform these calculations we have simulated , via the corsika code@xcite , @xmath5-induced showers with a crab - like spectrum ( @xmath6 ) and proton events with @xmath7 , both ranging from 100 gev to 50 tev .",
    "the @xmath5-rays have been simulated for different zenith angles ( @xmath8 ) , following the daily path of the source in the sky .",
    "the detector response has been simulated via a geant3-based code .",
    "the core positions have been randomly sampled in an area , energy - dependent , large up to @xmath9 centered on the detector .    in fig .",
    "[ nevents ] we show the fraction of showers with the core truly internal ( external ) to a fiducial area approximately equal to the carpet dimensions ( @xmath10 ) as a function of the number of pads fired on the argo - ybj carpet .",
    "the upper plot refers to @xmath5-induced showers , the lower to proton - induced events .",
    "as expected , for low pad multiplicities the events are mainly external : about @xmath11 of the @xmath5-induced showers with a multiplicity of 100 - 150 fired pads are external to @xmath12 . but also for higher multiplicities the percentage of external events is consistent ( about @xmath13 ) .",
    "various parameters based on particle density or time information are under investigation to identify showers with core position outside a given fiducial area@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the performance of the following ones :    * position of the cluster with the highest particle density .",
    "* position of the cluster row / column with the highest particle density . *",
    "mean distance @xmath14 of all fired pads to the reconstructed shower core position .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ clusmax ] we show the distributions of the positions of the cluster with the highest particle density for @xmath5-induced showers which fire more than 100 pads on the central carpet . in the plots we compare the events with the core truly external to a 80 @xmath4 80 m@xmath15 fiducial area ( solid histograms ) and the truly internal ones ( dashed histograms ) .",
    "to investigate the discrimination power of this particular parameter we have simulated a detector completely instrumented up to @xmath16 100 @xmath4 110 @xmath17 , i.e. , containing 14 @xmath4 17 clusters .",
    "therefore , the cluster coordinates run from 1 to 14 ( x view ) and from 1 to 17 ( y view ) starting from the lower left corner of the carpet ( see fig .",
    "[ argo ] ) . the clear difference between the in and out showers suggests to tag as external the events with the highest particle density in the outer clusters and to reject them before exploiting any reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the mean lateral spread of the shower can be expressed as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of fired pads , @xmath20 is the reconstructed core position , @xmath21 is the position of the @xmath22-th fired pad , @xmath23 is the number of detected electrons in the @xmath22-th pad .",
    "the @xmath14 distribution for showers reconstructed inside a 80 @xmath4 80 m@xmath15 fiducial area is shown in fig . [ rppad ] ( solid histogram ) .",
    "the dashed line refers to truly in events while the dotted histogram refers to out showers erroneously reconstructed as internal .",
    "the shower cores have been calculated by means of the simple center of gravity method . as can be seen",
    ", the parameter @xmath14 identifies quite well the events with core outside the carpet .",
    "large distances between the true and the reconstructed shower axis lead to larger @xmath14 values .",
    "this fact offers the possibility to define a cut in @xmath14 to identify these events .",
    "a conservative choice is to reject showers with @xmath24 .    from these studies",
    "it follows that the identification of a large fraction of external events can be achieved by defining a suitable fiducial area and a combination of cuts in the parameters discussed above .",
    "different algorithms have been investigated to reconstruct the shower core position in the argo - ybj experiment@xcite .",
    "the most performant one is the maximum likelihood method .",
    "if @xmath25 is the average particle number expected on the @xmath22-th pad , then the probability of finding @xmath26 particles is @xmath27 therefore @xmath28 is the probability of finding 0 particles , and @xmath29 is the probability of finding 1 or more particles .",
    "the likelihood function ( lf ) is given by : @xmath30 .",
    "the natural logarithm of lf ( llf ) becomes a sum : @xmath31 where the index @xmath22 runs on the not fired pads , while the index @xmath32 refers to the fired pads .",
    "exploiting the relation @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the particle density expected on the @xmath22-th pad at a distance @xmath36 from the core .",
    "the lateral structure function @xmath37 has been calculated for the argo - ybj detector : @xmath38 with the normalization factor defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the moliere radius ( 133 m at ybj altitude ) , and a = 1.826 , b = 2.924 , c = 0.613 .",
    "@xmath42 is the pad area and @xmath43 is the total number of pads fired by the shower .",
    "the minimum value of -llf is then chosen as the best fit for the freely varying parameters @xmath44 , being @xmath45 the core coordinates and @xmath46 the shower size . in the following we will refer to this approach as to the  llf1 method  .",
    "we point out that expression ( [ eq - llf1 ] ) for -llf refers to the case of a poisson distribution in which the pads are not fired with probability @xmath47 or fired with probability @xmath48 . in our study",
    "almost always the fired pads have particle multiplicity 1 , and therefore such a simple discrimination can be made .",
    "however , if we consider a larger area as the whole rpc , the multiplicity can also be @xmath49 1 , and the proper poisson distribution on the fired rpcs appears more adequate . in this case",
    "the sum on fired elements is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the particle density expected on the j - th rpc at a distance @xmath52 from the core , @xmath53 is the recorded particle number and @xmath54 is the rpc area . the shower size can be calculated via the equation @xmath55 we call this calculation the",
    " llf2 method  . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that the differences between llf1 and llf2 increase , for a fixed area , with the particle density . in fig .",
    "[ llf1_llf2 ] we compare the shower core position resolution @xmath56 calculated by applying the llf1 and llf2 methods on the rpcs for @xmath5-induced showers with the core randomly sampled inside a @xmath57 area .",
    "as expected , the resolution worsens with the multiplicity if the llf1 approach is applied when the number of particles hitting the rpc is @xmath58 .",
    "we note that for very low multiplicities ( @xmath59 ) method llf1 is more performant than llf2 .",
    "indeed , the algorithm based on the rpc occupancy ( llf1 ) provides a better representation of the hit distribution in very poor showers .",
    "for very high multiplicities ( @xmath60 ) the shower core position is determined by llf2 with an uncertainty @xmath61 .    in fig .",
    "[ llf2 ] @xmath62 obtained with the llf2 method is shown as a function of multiplicity for @xmath5 and proton induced showers with core randomly sampled in an area , energy - dependent , large up to @xmath9 .",
    "the fiducial area is @xmath57 .",
    "the increase of the sampling area worsens the performance of the method because of the contamination by external events ( see fig .",
    "[ nevents ] ) .",
    "this effect can be limited exploiting the cuts described in section [ cut ] . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ llf2_rp ] we compare the shower core position resolutions for @xmath5 and proton showers after the following selection procedure : ( 1 ) rejection of the events whose highest density clusters are on the guard ring ( @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ) or on the boundaries of the central carpet ( @xmath65 ; @xmath66 ) ; ( 2 ) rejection of the events whose highest total density rows or columns are respectively in positions @xmath67 or @xmath68 ; ( 3 ) reconstruction of core coordinates @xmath69 using llf2 ; ( 4 ) further rejection of events with @xmath70 m.    for events with a multiplicity of @xmath71 hits @xmath62 improves from @xmath72 to @xmath73 for @xmath5-induced showers and from @xmath74 to @xmath75 for proton events . for any given multiplicity the shower core position resolution is better for @xmath5 than for proton induced showers , due to the larger lateral particles spread in the latter .",
    "the procedure ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) is one of the possible procedures to reject external events in the argo - ybj detector . in fig .",
    "[ finfout_4 ] the fraction of rejected events ( internal and external to @xmath10 , respectively ) is reported for @xmath5 and proton - induced showers . as can be seen , this algorithm is able to identify and reject a large fraction of external events : for photons this percentage is always larger than @xmath76 . for low multiplicities ( @xmath77 ) a significative fraction of internal events",
    "is erroneously rejected , especially in proton - induced showers .",
    "the fraction of internal and external events rejected with the above procedure is shown for different fiducial areas , separately for @xmath5-induced showers ( fig .",
    "[ areasg ] ) and for proton - induced events ( fig .",
    "[ areasp ] ) .",
    "the fraction of discarded showers increases with @xmath12 mainly at high multiplicities . for @xmath5-showers more than @xmath78 of external events",
    "are rejected for the investigated fiducial areas .",
    "the fraction of internal events erroneously rejected is less than @xmath13 for high multiplicities ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the performance of the procedure is lower for proton showers .    due to the larger lateral particles spread in proton showers the @xmath5/hadron relative trigger efficiency is smaller for external events than for internal ones .",
    "thus , a suitable choice of the fiducial area @xmath12 may improve the overall detector sensitivity to point @xmath5-ray sources even if the total effective area is decreased .",
    "the fraction of external events which triggers the argo - ybj detector is relevant , mainly for low multiplicities ( see fig . [ nevents ] ) . in this paper",
    "we discussed a possible procedure to tag and reject a relevant fraction of external showers before the calculation of the shower core position via the llf2 method , thus saving cpu time .",
    "we applied this algorithm to a sample of @xmath5-induced showers with a crab - like energy spectrum . for comparison",

    "we can reject more than @xmath78 of the external @xmath5 showers and more than @xmath81 of the external proton events , saving more than @xmath82 of the internal events ( for @xmath83 ) . as a consequence",
