    "following the very extensive research activity in graphene over the last 10 years @xcite , a great deal of interest in condensed matter physics ( and beyond @xcite ) has focused on other 2d and 3d dirac materials where the elementary low - energy noninteracting electronic energy dispersion is linear and can be written in the continuum long wavelength limit as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ( dirac ) fermi velocity and the @xmath8 signs denote electron / hole ( conduction / valence ) bands , respectively , meeting at the so - called dirac point @xmath9 in our notation ( where the conduction / valence bands meet making the system a gapless semiconductor or a semimetal ) . considerable theoretical work focusing on bulk chiral materials with a gapless band structure including weyl and 3d dirac semimetals @xcite has been carried out recently .",
    "this linear gapless massless chiral dirac band dispersion defines a solid state dirac material , and exciting new materials and experimental developments @xcite have led to the laboratory realization of 3d dirac materials ( i.e. , essentially the 3d generalization of 2d graphene ) by several groups .",
    "we mention here that for our purpose in the current work , dirac and weyl systems are equivalent ( i.e. our work applies to both systems equally ) as long as the appropriate degeneracy factor ( called ` @xmath10 ' in our work ) is used in the calculations",
    ". we will use the generic expression ` 3d dirac system ' to describe both materials in the current work .",
    "an intrinsic or undoped 3d dirac system is a semimetal with the linear electron ( conduction)-hole ( valence ) bands touching at the dirac point with the valence band completely full and the conduction band completely empty ( at @xmath11 ) since the chemical potential or the fermi level is precisely at the dirac point .",
    "such a system is charge - neutral by itself , but is unstable since any background doping ( intentional or unintentional ) converts the system into an extrinsic or doped semiconductor with either free electrons in the conduction band or free holes in the valence band ( depending on the nature of background doping ) .",
    "finite temperature also creates free carriers in the system , albeit maintaining its overall charge neutrality since equal numbers of thermally excited electrons and holes are created .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate to think of 3d dirac materials as gapless semiconductors rather than semimetals since the stable system is a doped or extrinsic semiconductor ( with linear chiral energy bands ) with free carriers . in any semiconductor , including 3d dirac systems , the most important physical property is the nature of charge transport which is easy to measure experimentally as a function of temperature , carrier density , and other variables ( e.g. , external magnetic field , applied pressure , etc . ) .",
    "drude or ohmic dc transport as a function of carrier density and temperature provides detailed information about the elementary excitations and scattering processes in the system , and is thus the very first property typically studied in the literature .",
    "indeed , transport studies of 3d metals and semiconductors as well as two dimensional electron gas systems and graphene have been among the most active research areas in physics and applied physics over the last sixty years ( since the beginning of the 1950s ) .",
    "recent work on graphene , the quintessential 2d dirac material , shows the great importance of transport properties in the context of dirac materials .",
    "@xcite the nature of transport in graphene has been actively debated @xcite over the last seven years , and the nature of the graphene dirac point has been elucidated through experimental and theoretical works studying density and temperature dependent electrical conductivity.@xcite more recently , transport properties of 2d surface states on 3d topological insulators have been studied in the context of understanding their fundamental properties.@xcite it is clear that understanding the transport properties of an electronic material is essentially the first step in developing a complete theory for the material itself . motivated by these considerations , we undertake in this work the development of a theory for the density and temperature dependent drude - boltzmann transport properties of 3d dirac materials using charged impurity and acoustic phonon scattering processes as the main resistive mechanisms .",
    "our theory includes the full effect of finite temperature screening due to the chiral linear band structure of the dirac system . the corresponding theoretical and experimental transport work on graphene ( i.e. , the most common 2d dirac material ) is extensively reviewed in refs . .",
    "in the current work , we explore the transport properties of 3d dirac systems theoretically , obtaining the dc conductivity as a function of both carrier density ( @xmath12 ) and temperature ( @xmath13 ) considering both the undoped ( intrinsic semimetal with the chemical potential precisely at the dirac point ) and the doped ( extrinsic semiconductor with the chemical potential in the conduction band at a fermi energy @xmath14 determined by the doping density ) .",
    "there have been several recent publications discussing transport properties of these 3d chiral materials , @xcite but the investigation including full temperature and density dependent screening effects on transport of 3d dirac semimetals , as we consider in the current work , has not been considered in the literature for 3d dirac materials . in addition , we provide a comparison among several different momentum relaxation processes ( e.g. disorder and phonon scattering , long - range and short - range disorder , transport and quantum relaxation , etc . ) , which has also not been discussed . in this paper",
    "we calculate transport properties incorporating the density and temperature dependent screening of random background quenched charged impurities , typically the most common disorder in semiconductors .",
    "we also include scattering by zero - range white - noise disorder arising , for example , from point defects .",
    "we also consider the temperature dependent conductivity limited by the acoustic phonon scattering in 3d dirac materials .",
    "similar transport theory results coupled with corresponding experimental conductivity measurements @xcite led to considerable fundamental understanding and progress in graphene physics as well as for surface transport in 3d topological insulator materials@xcite , and the expectation is that the same should happen in 3d dirac materials when appropriate transport measurements are carried out and compared with the theoretical results presented in the current work . in particular and as emphasized above , a thorough theoretical understanding of carrier transport properties is almost inevitably the first basic requirement in developing the physics and materials science of any new doped semiconductors .",
    "this is the context of our current theoretical work exploring the transport properties of doped 3d dirac materials which are a particular type of semiconductors with properties distinct from ordinary parabolic semiconductors",
    ". our work should be useful in understanding and interpreting experimental transport data in 3d dirac materials as they become available in the future .",
    "the theoretical approach we develop is physically motivated and based on the firm ( and remarkably successful ) conceptual framework of carrier transport theories in bulk semiconductors and semimetals as well as in 2d semiconductor systems@xcite and graphene@xcite .",
    "we use the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory within the relaxation time approximation for solving the boltzmann integral equation .",
    "we take into account resistive scattering by long - range and short - range impurity scattering as well as phonon scattering .",
    "the long - range disorder arises from random quenched charged impurities in the environment , which are invariably present either as dopant ions to produce free carriers in the system or as unintentional background impurities in the host material .",
    "the short - range disorder arises from atomic point defects which may be present in the system .",
    "the coulomb disorder arising from the quenched charged impurities is screened by free dirac carriers themselves which we treat within the finite temperature random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we note that the resistivity due to long - range unscreened coulomb disorder typically diverges in 3d electronic systems , and therefore , appropriate screening is an essential element of the theory in order to get meaningful finite ( rather than vanishing ) conductivity in the system .",
    "phonons are inevitable sources of scattering and can dominate transport at high temperatures .",
    "we therefore consider the phonon limited conductivity incorporating the acoustic phonon scattering in the 3d dirac semimetals which could be of importance at higher temperatures whereas the low - temperature conductivity should always be dominated by disorder .",
    "our theory includes screening , disorder and phonons on an equal footing for the calculation of the transport properties of 3d dirac systems within the boltzmann - rpa transport theory .",
    "in general , the conductivity is related to the transport relaxation time @xmath15 in disordered metals , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "there is another distinct relaxation time in a disordered system that is independent of @xmath15 , which is the single particle ( or quantum ) relaxation time @xmath17 defining the quantum level broadening .",
    "@xcite although @xmath15 and @xmath17 both arise from impurity scattering in the metallic regime , they are distinct from each other with no direct analytical relationship connecting them except for the simple model of completely isotropic s - wave zero - range impurity scattering where they become identical .",
    "it is well known@xcite that in ordinary 3d metals @xmath18 because of the strong screening effect ( i.e. , the effective impurity - electron interaction potential is short ranged ) .",
    "however , 3d dirac semimetals are qualitatively different even for this short - ranged white noise disorder due to their chiral symmetry , which suppresses backward ( i.e. , a scattering induced wave vector change by @xmath19 ) scattering .",
    "in addition , screening is weak in dirac systems due to the small density of states associated with the linear band dispersion , and hence long - range coulomb disorder could introduce differences between transport and quantum relaxation times , drawing a sharp contrast with 3d semiconductors ( and metals ) where @xmath20 typically holds even for coulomb disorder due to strong carrier screening .",
    "in this paper , we theoretically study @xmath4 and @xmath3 in 3d dirac semimetals due to long - range impurity scattering , finding interesting behavior in the ratio @xmath21 as a function of the effective coupling constant .",
    "we compare the ratio @xmath22 of 3d dirac semimetals with the corresponding situation in 2d graphene @xcite which is a typical 2d dirac material , finding significant differences .",
    "as we will show later in this paper , due to the chiral suppression of backward scattering , the zero - range white - noise s - wave isotropic disorder potential leads to @xmath23 in 3d dirac semimetals , in contrast to the @xmath24 condition in ordinary metals and semiconductors for short - range disorder . for 3d",
    "dirac semimetals with the coulomb disorder being strongly screened by the rpa screening we have @xmath25 depending on the ultraviolet cutoff of the linear band dispersion , even though for the corresponding thomas - fermi ( tf ) screening @xmath26 in the strong screening limit .",
    "this interesting ( and nontrivial ) difference between rpa and thomas - fermi screening in dirac systems arises from the subtle property of the chiral nature of the free carriers which suppresses the @xmath19 back - scattering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the boltzmann transport theory is presented to calculate the temperature and density dependent conductivity of 3d dirac semimetals in the presence of coulomb disorder ( i.e. random charged impurities ) .",
    "we also present screening ( by the carriers themselves ) within the rpa theory .",
    "section iii presents the results for the transport scattering time @xmath15 and the single particle relaxation time @xmath17 . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the acoustic phonon scattering limited resistivity of 3d dirac semimetals . in section",
    "v we discuss the results and predict experimental implications .",
    "before we discuss the temperature- and density - dependent conductivity we first consider temperature- and density - dependent screening ( or dielectric function ) since the coulomb disorder arising from the quenched charged impurities is screened by free dirac carriers themselves ( i.e. , the bare coulomb disorder @xmath27 becomes screened coulomb disorder @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dielectric function ) . within the rpa the screening function ( static dielectric function ) is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the 3d fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the static polarizability which is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 $ ] is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath36 is the ultraviolet cutoff arising from the linear band dispersion ( @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the lattice constant ) , showing that there is an ultraviolet renormalization of effective charge in 3d dirac systems in contrast to the 2d dirac system where the charge remains unrenormalized ( i.e. the corresponding 2d dirac polarizability function does not have any ultraviolet cut off correction @xcite ) , and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 ,   \\label{pit}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the finite temperature chemical potential which is determined by the conservation of the total electron density .",

    "( [ pit0 ] ) which is independent of the temperature  thus , temperature ( @xmath13 ) and ultraviolet cut off ( @xmath36 ) do not mix at all in the theory .",
    "thus , it is expected that the ultraviolet cutoff is irrelevant for the temperature dependent conductivity within rpa although it will manifest itself as a weak logarithmic effect in the zero - temperature resistivity arising from the scattering by the screened coulomb disorder .",
    "we will suppress this ultraviolet logarithmic dependence in most of our discussions below . at zero temperature @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \\;\\;\\ ;   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the low temperature limit ( @xmath47 ) the asymptotic forms of the polarizability become at @xmath48 @xmath49 and at @xmath50 @xmath51 \\left ( \\frac{t}{t_f } \\right ) ^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 $ ] at high temperatures ( @xmath54 ) we have @xmath55    before considering the full rpa screening effect we first consider tf screening which is defined as the @xmath48 limit of rpa .",

    "we note that the tf screening wave vector is simply related to the density of states at the fermi energy through the relationship : @xmath61 .     of 3d dirac semimetals as a function of wave vector for different temperatures and ( b ) temperature dependent tf wave vector @xmath62 as a function of temperature .",

    "we note that there are significant differences with the corresponding 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite lindhard screening function for ordinary metals ( i.e. , parabolic non - chiral 3d systems ) , but many similarities with 2d dirac systems ( e.g. , graphene ) @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the overall screening function for @xmath66 increases monotonically with temperature because of the thermal excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "this behavior is also found in graphene @xcite and is generic for gapless semimetals .",
    "the overall temperature dependence of 3d lindhard screening function decreases with temperature for @xmath67 , but increases with temperature for @xmath68 because the thermally excited electrons only in the conduction band weakens the long wavelength screening .",
    "the tf screening wave vector also shows different behavior from the ordinary metals where the tf wave vector decreases monotonically with temperature .",
    "however , the tf wave vector in 3d dirac semimetals increases linearly with temperature at high temperatures ( @xmath0 ) , but decreases quadratically at low temperatures ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "we note that the scaled screening function ( @xmath70 ) in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is very weakly dependent on the carrier density , and in fact the density dependent term of scaled @xmath73 arises only from the ultraviolet cutoff in eq .",

    "for rpa screening , @xmath181 even in the very strong screening limit and is dependent on the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath36 .",

    "for comparison we also show the results for screened short - range disorders within tf ( thick solid lines ) and rpa ( dashed lines ) . if the short - range disorder ( e.g. , atomic point defects ) is screened , the single particle relaxation time becomes larger than the transport scattering time in the strong screening limit .",
    "this phenomenon arises from the importance of @xmath176 rather than @xmath19 scattering in transport properties in 3d dirac semimetals .",
    "in section ii we considered the temperature dependent conductivity arising from the temperature dependent screening and energy averaging of the transport scattering time . since phonons are dominant scattering sources at high temperatures @xcite , in this section we consider the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons to calculate the acoustic phonon scattering limited conductivity of the 3d dirac system .",
    "when we consider the phonon emission and absorption at finite temperature the energy dependent relaxation time [ @xmath187 is defined by @xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the scattering angle between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 is the transition probability from the state @xmath79 to @xmath80 , and @xmath192 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath193 \\}^{-1}$ ] with @xmath194 and @xmath195 is the finite temperature chemical potential . the chemical potential at finite temperature must be determined self - consistently to conserve the total number of electrons .",
    "the transition probability can be expressed in terms of the matrix element for scattering @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the matrix element for scattering by acoustic phonons and @xmath198 is given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the acoustic phonon energy with @xmath201 being the phonon velocity and @xmath202 is the phonon occupation number @xmath203^{-1}$ ] .",

    "we consider the phonon limited resistivity in two distinct transport regimes depending on whether the phonon system is degenerate ( i.e. , bloch - grneisen , bg ) or non - degenerate ( equipartition , ep ) .",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath213 is defined as @xmath214 , which is given , in 3d dirac semimetals , by @xmath215 k with the phonon velocity measured in unit of @xmath216 cm / s and the density @xmath12 measured in unit of @xmath217 . in general , since the fermi velocity @xmath7 in 3d dirac semimetals is much larger than the acoustic phonon velocity , the scattering of electrons by acoustic phonons may be considered quasi - elastically . in the high temperature equipartition regime ( @xmath218 ) the relaxation time is calculated to be @xmath219 thus , in the non - degenerate ep regime the scattering rate [ @xmath220 depends linearly on the temperature . in particular , when the temperature is lower than the fermi temperature , i.e. , @xmath221 we can approximate @xmath222 .",
    "then , the density dependent scattering time is given as @xmath223 .",
    "since the density dependent conductivity is given by @xmath224 , the calculated phonon limited conductivity is independent of the electron density at temperatures much lower than the fermi temperature .",
    "note that for 2d graphene we also found the graphene resistivity limited by phonon scattering in ep regime is to be density independent.@xcite therefore the any density dependence in the conductivity in the ep regime may entirely arise from the impurity scattering discussed in the sec .",
    "ii . phonons should not contribute to the density dependence of the 3d dirac conductivity , except perhaps at very high temperatures .",
    "finally , we calculate the transport scattering times in the bg regime where @xmath225 . in the bg regime due to the exponential decrease of phonon population and the sharp fermi distribution , the scattering rate is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the relaxation time via the statistical occupation factors in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) becomes more complicated . by considering the full occupation factors we have in low temperature limits",
    "@xmath226 we obtain analytically @xmath227 thus , we find that the temperature dependent resistivity in the bg regime becomes @xmath228 without screening effects .",
    "we can include the screening effects on the bare scattering rates by dividing the matrix elements @xmath197 by the dielectric function of 3d dirac semimetals , @xmath229 .",
    "if we include screening effects by the carriers themselves the low - temperature resistivity goes as @xmath230 because the screening function provides an extra @xmath231 term .",
    "for intrinsic 3d dirac semimetals we have @xmath232 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "even though the resistivity in the ep regime is density independent , eq . ( [ tau_t ] ) indicates that the calculated resistivity in the bg regime is given by @xmath233 because @xmath234 , where @xmath63 is the density of states of 3d dirac semimetals .",
    "thus , the bg conductivity limited by phonon scattering at very low temperatures may manifest some density dependence , but it will be difficult to observe it experimentally since the overall phonon scattering effect is suppressed by the factor @xmath235 ( or even by @xmath236 if screening is important ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the low - temperature conductivity of a 3d dirac system is likely to be dominated by impurity scattering ( similar to ordinary semiconductors with phonon effects becoming unobservably small at very low temperatures ) .",
    "the high temperature conductivity should , however , decrease as @xmath237 due to acoustic phonon scattering as we show here .",
    "for comparison with experimental results ( when they become available ) , it is important to emphasize that , unlike in graphene where the fermi level and the carrier density can be tuned by externally applied gate voltages , the only way to obtain a finite carrier density in a 3d dirac system is through doping by impurities in which case @xmath238 will apply generically , leading to the @xmath11 conductivity @xmath239 in general , assuming @xmath240 .",
    "such an @xmath241 ( or equivalently @xmath242 ) scaling dependence @xcite of the low - temperature ( @xmath1 ) conductivity with doping density should be the hallmark of a 3d doped dirac system .",
    "since such variable doping samples are not easy to use in controlled experimental studies ( e.g. , the unintentional background impurities could vary from sample to sample in an unknown manner ) , we believe that the study of temperature scaling of conductivity may be the ideal way of establishing the dirac nature of a candidate 3d dirac system . in particular , the intrinsic undoped semimetallic behavior should manifest in the high - temperature limit ( @xmath243 ) , where @xmath244 if coulomb disorder prevails ( as is likely to be the case in the presence of charged dopants or impurities ) . at low temperatures ( @xmath245 ) ,",
    "the extrinsic doped behavior of the conductivity would lead to basically a temperature independent conductivity .",
    "when we consider phonon scattering the resistivity should be linear in temperature and density independent in the high temperature equipartition regime ( @xmath246 ) . in the low - temperature bg regime ( @xmath226 )",
    "the @xmath247 shows much higher power law behavior in temperature ( @xmath248 ) and the decreasing behavior with density as @xmath233 , but this is unlikely to be experimentally observable in the near future since very clean systems would be necessary .",
    "our results for the comparison between transport and single - particle scattering times indicate that the interesting result @xmath249 could apply in a large parameter regime in 3d dirac systems , which should be experimentally observable .    actually",
    ", we believe that the study of the density - dependent conductivity should be possible in 3d dirac systems if the carrier density ( @xmath12 ) itself , rather than the dopant density ( @xmath77 ) , is directly measured through the low - field hall effect . then , the conductivity at a fixed low temperature could be plotted against carrier density to obtain the expected @xmath250 ( for coulomb disorder ) or density - independent ( point defects or neutral impurities ) behavior as a function of carrier density , thus conclusively establishing the dirac nature of the 3d system . since the corresponding non - dirac parabolic semiconductors have completely different density scaling ( see table 1 )",
    ", the observation of the expected density - scaling in the electrical conductivity should be a smoking gun for the dirac nature of the 3d materials just as the linear - in - density behavior of conductivity is the hallmark of 2d dirac systems @xcite .",
    "we note that the generic density dependence of 3d dirac conductivity in the presence of both coulomb and zero - range disorder should be an increasing conductivity as @xmath250 which should then eventually saturates to a density - independent value at a high ( and sample - dependent ) carrier density where the short - range disorder effects eventually dominate the conductivity as the coulomb disorder gets screened out .",
    "such a crossover from a @xmath250 density dependence to a density - independent conductivity would be the smoking gun evidence for the dirac nature of the underlying 3d carrier , particularly if , in addition , one can obtain also the expected @xmath177 behavior in the relaxation times as derived in our theory .",
    "we note that such density dependent conductivity studies are carried out routinely in the experimental investigations of metal - insulator transition in 3d doped semiconductors ( e.g. p - doped si @xcite ) where the conductivity scaling as a function of doping density is the key physics being investigated . in the case of 3d dirac systems ,",
    "the great advantage is that one does not need to worry about the localization - induced metal - insulator transition because of the strong chirality - induced suppression of @xmath19-backscattering , and thus one expects a very large range of doping density ( and temperature ) over which the expected drude - boltzmann density and temperature scaling derived in our work should hold in the actual systems just as it does in the corresponding 2d graphene and 3d topological insulators .    in summary",
    ", we have provided a theory for impurity- and phonon - scattering limited transport properties of 3d dirac systems , both in undoped and doped situations and both for high and low temperatures .",
    "our predicted temperature dependent scaling behavior of the conductivity should distinguish a dirac system from an ordinary semiconductor .",
