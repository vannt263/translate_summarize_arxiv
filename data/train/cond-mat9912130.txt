    "almost all observed structural normal - incommensurate ( n - ic ) phase transitions are continuous ( see for instance ref . as example of continuous cases and ref . for rare examples of discontinuous ones ) .",
    "this is in contrast with other types of structural phase transitions that are generally discontinuous .",
    "such a discontinuity is not surprising because , as was pointed out by many authors @xcite , the second - order ( continuous ) phase transitions convert into first - order ( discontinuous ) ones because of many factors like shear deformations , crystal anisotropy , etc ... , except for phase transitions involving uniaxial ferroelectrics and ferroelastics .",
    "these factors are operative by virtue of order parameter fluctuations .",
    "we show that also a broad class of normal - incommensurate ( n - ic ) phase transitions should be discontinuous in pure materials due to the solid - state elasticity .",
    "we refer to transitions that are not too far from the mean - field tricritical point .",
    "then a question arises : why all observed experimentally n - ic phase transition are continuous ?    in perfect crystals the n - ic first - order phase transitions should exist but it is reasonable to assume that in real crystals the defects can smear them @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is well known @xcite that some defects influence dramatically on the incommensurate phases , destroying the long - range order at any concentration .",
    "therefore strictly speaking , there are no n - ic phase transitions in real crystals or in other words , these transitions are always smeared",
    ". however , this smearing is not observed in the experiments and n - ic phase transitions appears usually as `` ordinary '' transitions , i.e. without apparent smearing in the measured anomalies .",
    "as we have mentioned , what is surprising is that almost all n - ic phase transitions are second - order ones .",
    "we try to understand this general behaviour showing that first - order n - ic transitions can assume a continuous appearance if the crystal contains defects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we demonstrate that close to the mean - field tricritical point a second - order n - ic phase transition converts into a first - order one because of the combined effect of the solid - state elasticity and the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "it is important that the conversion takes place even in the framework of the first order perturbation theory of effects of critical fluctuations .",
    "the vicinity of the tricritical point where this conversion takes place is shown to be broad .",
    "in sec.iii we present the method to consider influence of defects on first - order phase transitions@xcite  @xcite within first order perturbation theory where only linear terms in defect concentration taken into account ( see e.g. ref . ) . to simplify the treatment ,",
    "the phase transition in the pure material is supposed to be describable within the classical landau theory . in sec.iv",
    "we apply the method to a first - order n - ic phase transition . because of the specific features of a incommensurate phase , this theory is not rigorously applicable here but we use the fact that n - ic transitions can be considered as a limiting case of some normal - commensurate ( n - c ) transitions .",
    "so we consider influence of defects on a normal - commensurate ( n - c ) first - order phase transition where the perturbation theory is valid , and then trace the changes produced by defects when the phase transition approaches a n - ic one .",
    "as we will see , we can not reach the n - ic phase transition because that means to go beyond the applicability of the perturbation theory , but we can reveal some qualitative trends which provide us a base for the speculations . in sec.v we show that the same trends take place when the first - order phase transition in the pure material is due to the combined effect of order parameter fluctuations and the solid - state elasticity as in sec.ii . finally , the sec.vi is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "among several factors that are relevant in the conversion of a second - order phase transition into a first - order one the most important one seems to be the solid - state elasticity . indeed , as it is shown in ref .",
    ", close to the mean - field tricritical point the combined effect of the order parameter fluctuations and the solid - state elasticity is so strong that the second - order phase transition converts into a first - order one quite far away from the region where the critical fluctuations become too much important . in other words , this converted phase transition takes place in the region of applicability of the landau theory where the effects of the critical fluctuations can be considered within the first order perturbation theory . this question was reconsidered for structural displacive transitions in ref . , and it was shown that the region where the above - mentioned mechanism of conversion of a second - order into first - order phase transition results operative is very broad . only the case of one component order parameter was considered .",
    "we shall show now how the same conclusions are valid for a n - ic phase transition .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of one-@xmath0 incommensurate phase , i.e. the case of two component order parameter ( designated as @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "then , the landau continuous - media potential takes the form : @xmath2 dv\\ ] ] with @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bulk modulus and @xmath6 is the shear modulus ( to compare with ref . ) .",
    "we shall assume that the coefficient @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ pot1 ] is the only temperature dependent coefficient : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive constant and @xmath10 would be the second - order transition temperature if coupling between elasticity and fluctuations is neglected .",
    "the other coefficients may depend on pressure but we consider them positive constants .    as usually , it is assumed that the landau potential is obtained as result of a partial integration of the partition function over all degrees of freedom , except those that correspond to the long - wave fourier components of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to find thermodynamic quantities , one has to integrate besides all the degrees of freedom except those probed in experiment . for our purpose",
    "it is enough to leave unintegrated the zero fourier component of the order parameter . as in ref .",
    "we minimize over the elastic degrees of freedom . at this point one",
    "has to make out the spatially homogeneous ( @xmath13 ) and inhomogeneous ( @xmath14 ) parts of strain : @xmath15 e^{i{\\mathbf k\\cdot r}}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is @xmath0-fourier component of the displacement vector .",
    "minimizing over the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous strain separately one obtains : @xmath17 \\right ) ^2-   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{r^2}{2\\gamma } { \\sum_{{\\mathbf k}\\neq 0 } } { \\sum_{{\\mathbf k}_1,{\\mathbf k}_2 } } % \\left [ \\eta _ { 1{\\mathbf k}_1}\\eta _ { 1-{\\mathbf k}_1-{\\mathbf k}}+\\eta _ { 2{\\mathbf k}_1}\\eta _ { 2-{\\mathbf k}_1-{\\mathbf k}}\\right ]",

    "thus , the incomplete thermodynamic potential is : @xmath35 as @xmath24 is quadratic in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the integration can be easily performed , obtaining : @xmath38 using the fact that in the incommensurate phase , the system is invariant respect to the phase of the order parameter vector @xmath21 , we can choose it freely .",

    "[ uctuaciones ] . from the first two terms",
    ", one can see that the fluctuations provoke a renormalization also in the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath45 .",
    "this renormalization also takes place in the rest of the terms because of higher order corrections . since this renormalization is not of interest within our phenomenological theory , henceforth that all the coefficients correspond to their renormalizated values",
    "then , the final form of the thermodynamic potential including the effects of order parameter fluctuations and solid - state elasticity is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .    the same discussion as in ref . about the final character of the phase transition can be carried out now for a n - ic one . as in that work",
    "we can see that close to the mean - field tricritical point , the order parameter at the transition temperature is such that : @xmath48 as in ref .",
    "we find the value of the coefficient a at the transition temperature ( @xmath49 ) and the order parameter discontinuity at the transition ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 @xmath52 we must conclude that the combined effect of order parameter fluctuations and the solid - state elasticity over a n - ic phase transition forces it to be discontinuous .",
    "this assertion is correct in a region close to the mean - field tricritical point , i.e. as can be see in ref . in a region",
    "such that @xmath53 .",
    "it is highly unlikely that all the reported n - ic phase transitions lie out of this region because it is very broad for structural systems .",
    "such a conclusion is only applicable when dealing with perfect crystals because in our treatment we have forgotten about the influence of defects .",
    "in this section we expose briefly the simplest version of treatment of influence of defects on first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this allows us to present formulas that are easy to generalize in the cases of our interest . what is more important : in these formulas we keep a term that , although omitted in previous papers , it is essential in the context of this work .    within this section",

    "so nonlinear corrections to equations [ deltaa1 ] and [ deltaeta1 ] would be inconsistent with the applicability criterion for equations [ minimodefect ] and [ continuidadefect ] .",
    "in as follows we consider n - ic phase transition as a special case of phase transition with two component order parameter ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) corresponding to isotropy in order parameter space .",
    "this means that all invariants that we must consider in landau thermodynamics potential are power of the second order invariant @xcite . in other words , taking the landau potential density in the form : @xmath97 we approach a n - ic first - order transition if @xmath98 and all other coefficients are considered , positive except @xmath32 and temperature independent except @xmath57 . now to make allowances for defects we add to the thermodynamic potential density a term : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the two components of a",

    "we apply the method of the preceding section to find out the thermodynamic potential as a function of the zero fourier components ( @xmath108 designated for simplicity by @xmath109 and @xmath96 ) .",

    "iv ) . here",
    "the correction to the transition temperature also remains finite but do not tends to zero . as well as in the preceding section",
    "this indicates that while the defects suppress very strongly the order parameter discontinuity even for small defect concentrations but they weakly influence the phase transition temperature .",
    "hypothetical n - ic first - order phase transitions are strikingly different from other  ordinary  first - order phase transitions where phase temperature always diminishes because of influence of defects , see fig.[figure ] .",
    "lowering of transition temperature in fig.[figure ] ( a ) , ( b ) is consistent with the expectation that at some high enough defects concentration the phase transition temperature becomes equal to zero and the phase transition no more exists .",
    "the practical absence of this shift for a n - ic first - order phase transition ( fig.[figure ] ( c ) ) seems to indicate that the crystal with defects `` remembers '' the first - order transition temperature in the pure material .",
