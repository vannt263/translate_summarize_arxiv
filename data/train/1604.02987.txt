    "the origin and evolution of spiral arms in disk galaxies is a fundamental problem in astrophysics .",
    "the classical theory on spiral arm dynamics is the lin - shu model @xcite .",
    "the lin - shu model postulates a quasi - stationary standing wave pattern that rotates around the galactic center with a constant pattern speed . in this model , spirals are long - lived and the so - called winding problem is avoidable .",
    "however , the wave packet evolves with the group velocity , and it is finally absorbed at the lindbrad resonances @xcite .",
    "thus , to maintain the density wave it requires some generating mechanisms such as waser @xcite or @xmath0-barrier @xcite .",
    "with the recent progress of @xmath1-body simulations of spiral galaxies , the new picture of spiral arm formation and evolution was proposed .",
    "contrast to the lin - shu model , the spiral arms in @xmath1-body simulations are not stationary but transient and recurrent , appearing and disappearing continuously @xcite .",
    "the basic process in this activity is so - called swing amplification @xcite . in a differentially rotating disk ,",
    "a leading wave rotates to a trailing one because of the differential rotation .",
    "if toomre s @xmath0 is @xmath2 , the amplitude of the rotating wave is enhanced by the self - gravity @xcite . with a perturber such as the corotating over - dense region ,",
    "the stationary wave patterns are excited by the swing amplification @xcite .",
    "even if there are no explicitly corotating perturbers , the small leading wave always exists since a disk consists of a finite number of stars .",
    "thus , without an explicit perturber , the trailing wave can grow spontaneously due to the swing amplification mechanism @xcite .",
    "we have been exploring the role of the swing amplification in the spiral arm formation and evolution in detail .",
    "@xcite investigated the pitch angle of spiral arms using local @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "they found that the pitch angle decreases with the shear rate .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the global @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "based on the linear theory of the swing amplification , they obtained the pitch angle and found it agrees with that obtained through @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "@xcite extended the previous study and investigated the radial and azimuthal wavelengths and the amplitude of spiral arms using @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "they found that the dependencies of these quantities on the shear rate or the epicycle frequency agree well with those according to the linear theory of the swing amplification .",
    "these quantitative results indicate that the swing amplification surely plays an important role in the spiral arm formation and evolution .",
    "the @xmath1-body simulations that support the swing amplification mechanisms show the formation of the multi - arm spirals @xcite .",
    "thus we should be careful to apply the swing amplification mechanism to the grand - design spirals .",
    "in addition , the swing amplification model is constructed based on the local approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the swing amplification mechanisms is not directly applicable to the global structure .",
    "instead , we can apply it to the multi - arm spirals or flocculent spirals .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the short - term activities of the grand - design spirals in barred galaxies may be explained by the swing amplification @xcite .",
    "a further study is necessary to clarify the role of the swing amplification in the global structure .",
    "however , since the swing amplification itself is a general and fundamental mechanism in the various types of disks , understanding a physical process of the swing amplification is important .",
    "for example , the origin of the short - scale spiral arms in saturn s ring , so - called self - gravity wakes , may be formed by the swing amplification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical process of the swing amplification is complicated because it relates with three fundamental elements , the self - gravity , the shear , and the epicycle oscillation . to shed light on the physical process of the swing amplification",
    ", @xcite introduced the simple model of the swing amplification .",
    "this model is similar to the model proposed by @xcite except for the treatment of the velocity dispersion . to introduce the effect of the velocity dispersion of stars",
    ", he used the reduction factor instead of the gas pressure term .",
    "hereafter we refer to this model as the glbt model .",
    "he posited that the motion of a particle can be described by the simple oscillation equation with the variable frequency and argued that his model gives the same result as that of the rigorous model based on the collisionless boltzmann equation by @xcite ( hereafter refereed to as jt model ) .",
    "while the basic equation in the jt model is complicated , the glbt model is simple and its dynamical behavior is easy to understand . using the glbt model , the swing amplification has been explained in some review papers @xcite .    at first glance , it seems that the glbt model was derived using the equation of motion of a single particle in the rotational frame .",
    "however , strictly speaking , it is impossible to derive the basic equation directly .",
    "as shown below , instead of the equation of motion of a single particle , we should begin with the lagrange description of the hydrodynamic equation .",
    "furthermore , the original numerical calculation method was ambiguous .",
    "the reduction factor was used for introducing the effect of the velocity dispersion , but no details of its treatment were given .",
    "in some subsequent review papers , the amplification process was explained based on the glbt model , but the derivation of the basic equation and the detailed numerical treatment were not described there @xcite .",
    "we show that the additional assumption on the vorticity perturbation is necessary for deriving the basic equation and the naive numerical treatment leads to breakdown of the model in the strong shear case such as a keplerian rotation .",
    "@xcite compared the amplification factor by the glbt model with that by the jt model and found that the dependence of the amplification factor on the azimuthal wavelength has a similar tendency for the flat rotation curve .",
    "however , the comparison with the general shear rate was not performed . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed the similar analyses with the general shear rate .",
    "however , they did not compare them with the jt model .",
    "furthermore , in all previous works , the wavelength and the pitch angle for the maximum amplification were not investigated in detail .",
    "thus , we investigate the detailed dependence of the amplification factor on the epicycle frequency , the pitch angle , and wavelengths and compare them with those in the jt model .",
    "this work is the first comprehensive comparison between jt and glbt models .",
    "in addition , we clarify the dynamical behavior of the solution in detail and find the synchronization of the epicycle phase that was not pointed out in the previous works explicitly .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 examines the basic equation of the glbt model . in section 3 , we solve the equation numerically and investigate the most amplified wave . in section 4",
    ", we derive the pitch angle formula by the order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a summary .",
    "we revisit the glbt model of the swing amplification proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the evolution of the spiral amplitude is described by the spring dynamics with the variable spring rate .",
    "however , he did not describe the complete derivation of the basic equation .",
    "thus we describe the derivation in detail .",
    "we consider a small thin region of a galaxy and introduce a local rotating cartesian coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4-axis is directed radially outward , the @xmath5-axis is parallel to the direction of rotation , and the @xmath6-axis is normal to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "we investigate the evolution of a rotating wave in the lagrangian description .",
    "a particle located at @xmath7 at the initial time @xmath8 moves to @xmath9 at time @xmath10 . in the unperturbed state ,",
    "the surface density of particles @xmath11 is uniform .",
    "the unperturbed position of the particle at time @xmath10 is @xmath12 . since in the unperturbed state",
    "the self - gravity parallel to the @xmath13 plane vanishes , the equation of motion is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the circular frequency , and @xmath16 is the oort constant .",
    "the derivation @xmath17 is the lagrangian derivative with respect to @xmath10 , which means the time derivative with @xmath18 and @xmath19 fixed .",
    "we assume that the unperturbed solution is a circular orbit and is described by @xmath20    we consider the perturbation due to the displacement .",
    "the perturbed displacement generally depends on the position and the time as @xmath21 .",
    "the particle located at @xmath22 in the unperturbed state moves to the position @xmath23 , then the density changes due to the displacement . considering the mass conservation , the surface density @xmath24",

    "the properties of the reduction factor that are necessary in the following discussion are summarized in appendix [ ap : red ] .",

    "however , as shown by @xcite this simple approach gives the similar results as those of the rigorous analysis by the collisionless boltzmann equation .",

    "for @xmath118 and small @xmath119 , equation ( [ eq : spring ] ) does not have a real solution , where the negative reduction factor may arise from the breakdown of the tight - winding approximation .",
    "hence we introduce the lower bound to avoid the negative reduction factor and define the modified reduction factor @xmath120 as @xmath121 using this we define @xmath83 as @xmath122 equation ( [ eq : springnew ] ) always has a real solution that is less than or equal to @xmath123 ( see appendix [ ap : exist ] ) .",

    "when @xmath213 , the rotations of the wave and the rotating frame are canceled out in the inertial frame .",
    "this happens when @xmath214 , which roughly means that @xmath215 is large such as @xmath216 .",

    "thus if we observe an entire disk , we expect that the dominant wave corresponds to the wave with the maximum amplification factor approximately .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "they investigated the wave with the maximum amplification factor from the linear analysis and compared it with the dominant wave by @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "they confirmed that the time - averaged quantities of the dominant wave in @xmath1-body simulations are consistent with those of the waves with the maximum amplification factor by the linear analysis .",
    "therefore we assume that the observed spiral arms correspond to the wave with the maximum amplification factor .",
    "the wave pitch angle @xmath54 decreases with time due to the shear as @xmath217 where @xmath10 is the time elapsed since @xmath218 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed pitch angle corresponds to the angle when the wave density reaches maximum after the epicycle phase is synchronized .",
    "roughly speaking , the synchronization starts when @xmath218 .",
    "the density maximization occurs on the timescale of the epicycle period @xmath152 .",
    "thus , substituting @xmath219 into @xmath220 , we obtain the pitch angle formula @xmath221 that is the same as equation ( [ eq : fit_pitch2 ] ) except for the numerical factor and @xmath0 dependence .",
    "we considered the glbt model introduced by @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the glbt model is similar to that in @xcite except for the treatment of the gas pressure term .",
    "we investigated the derivation and calculation procedure in detail . to derive the basic equation",
    ", we need to assume that the constant of motion vanishes , which means that we focus on the initial perturbation without the vorticity perturbation @xcite .",
    "we found that the glbt model has the singularity and can not be applied to the case where @xmath222 .",
    "to avoid this singularity , we introduced the lower bound in the reduction factor .",
    "we calculated the maximum amplification factor and the corresponding wavelengths and compared them with those in the jt model .",
    "the overall dependence on @xmath141 in the glbt model is similar to that in the jt model .",
    "however they are slightly different from those in the jt model . in applying to the interpretation of numerical simulations or observations",
    ", we should use the glbt model carefully .",
    "it seems that the jt model is more reliable because it was derived in a more rigorous manner .",
    "we have already confirmed that those in the jt model are in good agreement with those in @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "regardless of this drawback , the glbt model is attractive because its basic equation is simple and gives us an insight into a nature of the swing amplification . using the glbt model",
    ", we found the synchronization phenomenon .",
    "the oscillation phase after the amplification is independent of the initial oscillation phase .",
    "this is because the oscillation phase is synchronized during the amplification .",
    "this may be the key process to understand the swing amplification .",
    "based on the phase synchronization , we derive the pitch angle formula by the order - of - magnitude discussion .",
    "however , this process has not yet been confirmed by @xmath1-body simulations . in the next paper",
    ", we will investigate the particle dynamics in spiral arms using @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "we investigated the elementary process of the swing amplification .",
    "however , in order to understand the overall spiral arm formation we should investigate the origin of the leading waves . in the swing amplification ,",
    "we postulate the existence of the strong leading waves . if the leading waves come only from the particle noises , they are too small to account for the amplitudes of spiral arms .",
    "another mechanism is necessary to generate the strong leading waves .",
    "one possible mechanism is the nonlinear wave - wave interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the nonlinear effect in the generation of the leading wave is poorly understood . in the future study",
    ", we will investigate this problem .",
