    "some strongly coupled lattice fermion - gauge models with a charged scalar field , which break chiral symmetry dynamically , might be considered to be a possible alternative to the higgs mechanism for mass generation , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on a prototype with @xmath0 gauge group , a scalar of fixed modulus and one staggered fermion ( corresponding to 4 flavors ) , where both the scalar and fermion have charge one .",
    "the action has been described in @xcite with three bare parameters @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical mass generation is meaningful only in the chiral limit @xmath2 .",
    "we consider here the phase transition line * net * between two phases @xcite :    \\(1 ) dynamical mass generation ( nambu ) phase , below the * net * line , where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken ( @xmath3 ) due to the strong gauge fluctuations so that the fermion mass @xmath4 is dynamically generated ;    \\(2 ) higgs phase , above the * nets * line , where the higgs mechanism is operative , but @xmath5 .",
    "the scalar field induces a second order chiral phase transition * ne * line which opens the possibility for approaching the continuum .    whether such a model can replace the higgs mechanism depends crucially on the existence and renormalizability of the continuum limit . to search for such a continuum theory and grasp its nature",
    ", we need to make precise determination of the second order phase transition point with divergent correlation lengths .",
    "for such a purpose , we have done extensive simulations using hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm and developed some new methods for locating the * ne * line .",
    "the hmc simulations have been done on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where on @xmath6 , we have better statistics ( 1024 - 6500 trajectories ) for different @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed results for the spectrum are reported in @xcite .",
    "we have measured the following local observables : plaquette energy @xmath8 , link energy @xmath9 and chiral condensate @xmath10 , where for @xmath10 we use the stochastic estimator method .",
    "however , it is very difficult to use the local quantities at finite @xmath11 to detect a critical behavior on the * ne * line , since they show smooth behavior as a function of @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "( one could expect the critical behavior only in the infinite volume and chiral limit . ) for @xmath14 near the point * e * , the peaks of susceptibility for different quantities develop and coincide , while the boson mass @xmath15 gets smaller .",
    "concerning the location of the * et * line , on the @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath16 or @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we find explicit two state signals from the thermo - cycle , time history and histogram analysis of the local quantities .    on the * ne * line",
    ", the @xmath19 meson shows more obviously the phase transition than other quantities . in the nambu phase",
    ", the @xmath19 meson should obey the pcac relation . in the symmetric phase ,",
    "the @xmath19 meson is no longer a goldstone boson , and one should observe a deviation from pcac . at @xmath20 , these properties are nicely seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , from which one sees that for @xmath21 where the system is in the broken phase , we have goldstone bosons .",
    "however , on @xmath6 , even at @xmath22 ( possibly in the chiral symmetric phase ) , a linear extrapolation leads to @xmath23 . for larger @xmath12",
    ", the extrapolated result gets smaller ( e.g. at @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and is expected to vanish in the @xmath26 limit . of course",
    ", one should not expect the linear extrapolation to be valid at the critical point .",
    "@xmath27 is not a convenient order parameter for the chiral transition of a finite system due to the sensitivity of chiral extrapolation .",
    "we employ a different method for determining the chiral transition , namely we calculate the chiral susceptibility in the chiral limit , defined by @xmath28 if there is a second order chiral phase transition , @xmath29 should be divergent ( in other words , @xmath30 should be zero ) at the critical point and in the thermodynamical limit . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the chiral susceptibility in the nambu phase is difficult to obtain , but it is calculable in the chiral symmetric phase @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the symmetric phase @xmath30 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) , is the same as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the positive eigenvalues of the massless fermionic matrix . approaching the * ne * line from the symmetric phase by fixing @xmath13 , @xmath33 should behave as @xmath34 corresponding to the divergent correlation length at the second order phase transition point in the thermodynamical limit @xmath26 . in the nambu phase",
    ", it can also be shown that eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) is equivalent to @xmath35 in the @xmath26 limit .",
    "then in such a limit , @xmath33 should be zero since @xmath36 in the nambu phase .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 defined in eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) is a suitable order parameter for the chiral phase transition : it is zero in the broken phase , and it is nonzero in the symmetric phase .",
    "let us again focus on the results at @xmath20 . to perform the calculation",
    ", we generalize mfa @xcite , in which the chiral limit @xmath2 is accessible , to the fermion - gauge - scalar models . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we observe that on @xmath37 the chiral transition appears at @xmath38 , being consistent with the observation of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm",
    "the location of the * ne * line on the available lattices obtained by the above methods is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the point * n * is plotted by interpolation .",
    "we have determined the phase transition line * ne * with high precision and demonstrated that this second order chiral transition line joins the higgs phase transition line at the end point * e * being around @xmath39 , separating the higgs and nambu phases .",
    "no finite size scaling analysis has been done , and larger lattices are required for such a purpose .    from the spectroscopy @xcite , we know that @xmath40 scales to zero when crossing the chiral transition line * ne*. nevertheless , the susceptibility for @xmath9 and correlation length for the composite scalar @xmath41 remain finite on the whole * ne * line except approaching the end point * e*. therefore , the end point , hopefully being a second order point with divergent correlation lengths , is the most suitable candidate for the continuum limit .",
    "further work to be done is to study the finite size effects , analyze the dependence of the end point * e * on the bare fermion mass , investigate the scaling properties and understand the nature of the end point , which is underway @xcite .",
