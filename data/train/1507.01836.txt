    "the last decade has seen a surge of interest in so - called `` active '' materials , whose constituent building blocks violate time - reversal symmetry on the microscopic scale by continuously converting fuel into motion .",
    "these building blocks can be natural , such as swimming bacteria or algae  @xcite , or synthetic , such as self - phoretic janus swimmers  @xcite . apart from deepening our understanding of nonequilibrium systems , and in particular about how and when concepts from equilibrium thermodynamics can ( and",
    "can not ) be applied to such systems  @xcite , a strong motivation behind active matter research is that activity can be harnessed to create devices and induce phenomena that would be impossible in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "examples include flow of rotor particles round a circuit  @xcite , steady rotation of a gear wheel in a bacterial bath  @xcite , and pumping of bacteria between chambers by `` funnel gates ''  @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "we show how irreversible motion in a particular class of active matter  light - controlled self - propelled particles  can be used for self - assembling active `` rectification devices '' and circuits directly from an unstructured active - particle suspension using only spatially controlled ( but possibly incoherent ) lighting .",
    "such light - controlled motility has been experimentally demonstrated several times , both in synthetic systems @xcite and natural ones ( strains of escherichia coli bacteria whose motility requires illumination ) @xcite .",
    "the possibility of such light - controlled self - assembly is far from obvious , since light intensity is , for our purposes , a scalar rather than a vector field : it controls the speed of particles , but not their orientation ; therefore , uniform illumination does not itself create directional motion .",
    "this differs fundamentally from magnetotaxis , for example , in which a uniform vector field directs motion by aligning the propulsion direction of particles @xcite . because of the ubiquity of spatial - light - modulator ( slm ) technology @xcite , the ability to create active rectification devices using light - induced self - assembly could have many advantages over conventional microfluidic approaches to rectification @xcite . in particular , it would allow real - time device reprogramming rather than mechanical interchange of fixed microfluidic elements .",
    "our proposed strategy hinges on the tendency of motile particles to accumulate in regions where they move slowly @xcite .",
    "this allows one to use light to sculpt regions of high and low particle density .",
    "so long as the particles interact repulsively , the dense regions might be used to create , in effect , microfluidic obstacles of a type previously used for rectification @xcite .",
    "we first develop this appealingly simple avenue before turning to other approaches that prove more efficient .",
    "the slowing - induced accumulation of motile particles is much like the crowding of pedestrians who slow down in front of a shop window on a busy street @xcite . within a wide class of models",
    "@xcite , it is quantified as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the steady - state mean particle density at position @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the local swim speed @xcite .",
    "this result has no counterpart for nonmotile ( e.g. , brownian ) particles in thermal equilibrium , whose steady - state density is governed solely by the boltzmann distribution , and whose speed statistics remain completely independent of their position .",
    "it applies rigorously for noninteracting particles @xcite and generalizes as @xmath4 to cases where interactions cause the average local swim speed @xmath5 to differ from the local value for an isolated particle , @xmath6 , which we assume to be illumination - controlled @xcite .",
    "for our proof - of - concept simulations we deploy a well - studied model of `` active brownian particles '' in two spatial dimensions .",
    "each particle swims with a constant speed @xmath7 along a particle - fixed axis that rotates by autonomous angular diffusion ; this motion is influenced by interparticle collisions ( see methods ) .",
    "it is known that at fixed , spatially uniform @xmath7 , collisions cause a linear dependence of the average swim speed on density : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the volume fraction of particles in two dimensions , @xmath10 the particle diameter , and @xmath11 a near - close - packed volume fraction that depends on interaction details @xcite .",
    "hence , in this system one might expect that if a spatial speed - modulation pattern @xmath6 is imposed , @xmath12 should everywhere obey @xmath13 .",
    "this prediction is tested in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] for a modulation pattern comprising a lattice of @xmath14 circular traps , each with a different uniform nominal speed @xmath15 , @xmath16 , in its interior and a larger speed @xmath17 between the traps .",
    "( we use periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "the agreement is excellent , except at the highest densities where , with the chosen interactions ( see methods ) , particles show significant overlap , invalidating the assumed linear dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "time - averaged local volume fraction @xmath20 of interacting and noninteracting particles in a system with spatially patterned one - particle swim speed @xmath6 , where @xmath21 in the @xmath22th well and @xmath23 between the wells .",
    "the solid lines show our predictions with a prefactor determined by least - squares fits , where we neglected the three highest density ( @xmath24 ) data points for the interacting particles .",
    "inset : spatially resolved plot of @xmath20 for the interacting particles ; note the logarithmic scale on the color bar . ]",
    "the above results demonstrate that for motile particles with repulsions , just as for noninteracting ones , the density pattern @xmath25 can be rather precisely manipulated by spatial modulation of the one - particle swim speed @xmath6 . but",
    "[ lattice ] does not demonstrate rectification : that would require either a continuous steady - state particle current , or , if the boundary conditions prevent such a current , two areas of the same @xmath7 to acquire different densities .",
    "only then can one claim to have converted incoherent particle dynamics , which by itself is responsible for the @xmath26 behavior , into a systematic pumping effect .",
    "( a ) time - averaged particle packing fraction @xmath20 at steady state in a system of self - assembled funnels .",
    "note the logarithmic scale on the color bar .",
    "( b ) magnification of one of the funnels , showing the self - assembly process at three different times starting from a homogeneous particle distribution ; @xmath27 is the lennard - jones time ( see methods ) .",
    "( c ) black curve : the packing fraction @xmath19 from ( a ) , but now as a function of @xmath28 and averaged over @xmath29 ; the pumping effect ( rectification ) is obvious .",
    "red curve : for noninteracting particles , rectification is not possible . ]",
    "a simple strategy for achieving such rectification is to create a light - guided density pattern that mimics microfluidic devices .",
    "such devices generally operate at the one - particle level : a series of obstacles is created so that each particle is geometrically biased toward a nonzero average motion .",
    "however , when the obstacles are made of other particles this becomes an inherently many - body mechanism that computer simulations can illuminate . in an elegant experimental demonstration of one - particle rectification , galajda _ _",
    "et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite established that a wall of microfabricated chevron - shaped obstacles or `` funnels '' will rectify a suspension of swimming _ escherichia coli _ bacteria .",
    "asymmetric pumping across such a wall between two chambers of the same @xmath7 can yield more than a factor - two density difference .",
    "the effect of additional layers of walls is multiplicative on the density ratio @xcite .    inspired by these experiments",
    ", we now simulate a set of chevron - shaped `` dark '' regions , in which the nominal swim speed @xmath6 is set to zero . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ funnel ] and movie s1 , this pattern rapidly guides the self - assembly of a set of funnel - like obstructions which in turn cause rectification .",
    "the mechanism is almost the same as in refs .",
    "@xcite : the trajectories of motile particles will tend to trace the funnel wall , making the probabilities of passing through the funnel from either side unequal . however , because our funnels assemble reversibly from the motile particles themselves , such rectification requires not only time - irreversible trajectories ( wall - tracing ) and broken reflection symmetry of the modulation pattern @xcite but also repulsive interparticle interactions ( fig .  [ funnel ] ) . unlike conventional microfabricated structures , ours could in principle be dismantled and re - assembled into a completely different structure , simply by reprogramming the light intensity pattern to give a different @xmath6 .",
    "crucially , the mechanism requires no external or interparticle forces that align the swimming directions of the particles .",
    "as a first proof of principle , these are striking results . however , the efficiency of our device ( measured as the ratio between the densities in the inner and the outer compartments ) is modest : the density ratio induced by three pairs of funnel walls is about 1.6 ( see fig .",
    "[ funnel]c ) , compared to about 2.8 seen in _ escherichia coli _ experiments using a single microfabricated funnel wall @xcite and in simulations of rod - shaped particles in a similar geometry @xcite .",
    "as shown in the supplementary material , this is largely because our self - assembled many - particle funnels can not prevent particles from `` leaking '' backwards against the pumping flux , limiting their pumping efficiency .",
    "a contrasting single - particle rectification strategy deploys microfabricated wedge - shaped solid barriers with one steep and one shallow side .",
    "such barriers have been shown experimentally @xcite to make swimming bacteria preferentially transport passive tracer colloids from the shallow side and deposit them on the steep side of the barrier , leading to a significant steady - state accumulation .",
    "loosely inspired by this , we abandoned the chevron design , and imposed a simpler , one - dimensional sawtooth - shaped speed profile @xmath30 shown in fig .",
    "[ density_ratchet ] .",
    "this leads to the self - assembly of an asymmetric barrier with a distinctive density profile @xmath31 .",
    "steady - state packing fraction @xmath32 ( solid curves ) in a system with a modulated speed @xmath30 composed of two opposing saw - tooth profiles ( dashed curves ) , obtained from particle - resolved simulations and our continuum model . for numerical reasons ,",
    "the discontinuities of @xmath30 are smeared out over @xmath33 in the continuum calculations .",
    "the inset shows @xmath32 with a magnified @xmath29 scale , clearly demonstrating the rectification . ]",
    "remarkably , this extremely simple device shows a density ratio of almost @xmath34 and thus a strong rectification ( see inset of fig .  [ density_ratchet ] ) .",
    "note that particles must pass through , but not over or around , the barrier so that the `` leakage '' encountered earlier is being exploited here . to study this rectification ,",
    "we have extended a continuum model , involving local density and orientation fields coupled in a standard manner @xcite , to the case where the swim speed depends on both position and density ( see methods ) .",
    "the rectification is found to arise from a polarization ( i.e. , alignment of particle orientations ) on the dense ( steep ) side of the barrier ; here the average swimming direction of the particles is oriented into the barrier ( see the supplementary material for details ) . this polarization is a straightforward consequence of the irreversible particle motion , which makes particles that swim towards a solid object such as a wall become `` trapped '' there until their swimming direction has rotationally diffused enough to let them escape , creating an average particle orientation pointing into the object .",
    "the polarization in turn creates a mechanical pressure that drives a particle flux from the steep side of the barrier towards the shallow side . in more mathematical terms , rectification rests on the presence of a density - gradient - driven pumping effect that is nonzero _ only _ in a small region close to the barrier .",
    "flux balance then requires a change in the uniform steady - state particle densities in the bulk regions far to the left and to the right of the barrier , where density gradients , and thus the pumping effect , approach zero .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems , here local gradient effects cause rectification across an interface between bulk regions , rather than merely shifting the interfacial tension @xcite .      by using aligned ( instead of opposing ) barriers and applying suitable boundary conditions , either of the above devices can be reconfigured to create an `` active circuit '' , where motile particles flow endlessly around a closed loop at steady state . in ref .",
    "@xcite macroscopic circulation was achieved with field - driven autorotors with hydrodynamic alignment interactions . in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] we give computational proof - of - principle for a simpler design that employs the speed modulation from fig .",
    "[ density_ratchet ] , but now with two aligned saw teeth . in this example , colloids are confined to an annulus by a surrounding dark region ; thus , both the `` circuit '' itself and the rectifying elements arise solely by light - guided self - assembly .",
    "( a ) particle - resolved simulations of an annular circuit self - assembled through a prescribed speed profile @xmath3 with two similar saw teeth along the annulus and a very low speed outside of the annulus .",
    "the resulting dense particle packing outside of the annulus ( not shown for clarity ) confines the motile particles to the circuit .",
    "the color map shows the time - averaged steady - state local packing fraction @xmath20 and vectors denote the rescaled local particle current @xmath35 , with their colors indicating the absolute current density @xmath36 .",
    "the logarithmic color bar applies both to the density plot and to the vector field plot .",
    "( b ) corresponding plot of the rescaled particle density @xmath37 and particle current @xmath35 obtained from our continuum model . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have given proof - of - principle evidence , using computer simulations and theoretical considerations , that self - assembled active rectification devices for motile particles can be created solely through spatial modulation of the local propulsion speed @xmath6 .",
    "this space - dependent propulsion speed can in turn be realized by a space - dependent illumination @xcite and hence rendered programmable through use of slms .",
    "a key element of the light - guided assembly strategy presented here is that the illumination supplies the particles only with _",
    "scalar _ information , namely the instruction to swim at a certain speed . in some experimental systems",
    "the light elegantly also supplies the energy source for swimming @xcite , but this is not always the case @xcite , and is not an essential ingredient in our proposed strategy .",
    "crucially , in our mechanism the optical field does not exert directional forces directly on the particles .",
    "this differs fundamentally from , and requires much lower light intensities than , the manipulation of particles by optical tweezers ; as an example , the light - propelled particles of ref .",
    "@xcite require light intensities of @xmath38 @xmath39w@xmath40m@xmath41 , compared to intensities of @xmath42 @xmath39w@xmath40m@xmath41 typically used in optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "our mechanism can be easily applied to large - scale systems containing many particles , circumventing several disadvantages of traditional micro - manipulation techniques @xcite , such as significant heating - up of the system and the need for complicated optical equipment . indeed , although use of slms would certainly be appealing , there is no requirement that the light field even be coherent .",
    "our work points towards a new technological opportunity in which light - guided self - assembly is not only used to make crystals and other aggregates @xcite but also to create programmable , active rectification devices from an initially structureless `` primordial soup '' of self - propelled particles .",
    "the capacity to do this stems from an interplay between microscopically irreversible particle motion , spatially asymmetric light modulation , and interparticle repulsions .",
    "these findings may also be relevant for controlling mass transport in biological systems , steering pattern formation in future applications of active particles in materials science , and the wider deployment of active particles in colloidal self - assembly .",
    "our particle - resolved computational studies use a simple model of swimming microorganisms ( like motile bacteria and protozoa ) and artificial microswimmers , known as `` active brownian particles '' .",
    "such particles exhibit persistent propulsion in a particle - fixed direction which rotates through thermal rotational diffusion .",
    "this model has been shown to capture many essential features of active matter systems such as bacterial suspensions , while still allowing for both the derivation of exact results from first principles and computational studies of systems containing millions of particles .",
    "the active colloids are modeled as spherical particles with diameter @xmath10 moving on a two - dimensional substrate .",
    "they interact repulsively through a truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential @xmath43 with the center - to - center particle distance @xmath44 and an upper cut - off at @xmath45 , beyond which @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 determines the interaction strength and @xmath48 is the inverse thermal energy .",
    "the motion of these particles is described by the overdamped langevin equations @xmath49where @xmath50 is the position and @xmath51 is the orientation of the @xmath22th particle at time @xmath52 . in our",
    "particle - resolved brownian dynamics simulations we solved these langevin equations numerically using the lammps molecular dynamics package @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the nominal swim speed of an active particle at position @xmath2 , @xmath53 is an orientational unit vector that denotes the propulsion direction of a particle with orientation @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the total conservative force on particle @xmath22 , which results from the interactions with other particles and thus depends on @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the constant translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of the particles , respectively , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are zero - mean , unit - variance gaussian white noise terms . the natural time unit in this model is the lennard - jones time @xmath61 .",
    "further technical details about the particle - resolved simulations can be found in the supplementary material .      in our continuum simulations we solved the following dynamic equations for the local particle density @xmath62 and the local polarization @xmath63 numerically : @xmath64 here",

    "the average swim speed @xmath72 of an active particle at position @xmath2 in an active suspension of density @xmath73 is known from particle - resolved simulations @xcite to be linearly decreasing with @xmath73 . nevertheless , in our numerical calculations based on the continuum model we used the expression @xmath74 , where the parameter @xmath75 determines how quickly the average local swim speed decreases with density .",
