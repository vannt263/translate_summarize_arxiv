    "recently , the study of spin properties of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , realized at the interface of semiconductor - insulator / semiconductor heterojunctions @xcite , has attracted a great deal of interest . envisaged as having its fundamental as well as technological importance ( e.g. , in spintronics @xcite ) ,",
    "one of the chief concerns has been to determine the 2d spin phase diagram . in this regard ,",
    "the recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite have revealed that the electron correlations may favor a weakly first - order spin - polarization transition at @xmath0 before the evolution of wigner crystallization at @xmath1 . unlike in a 3des @xcite",

    "experimentally , the spin properties have been probed mainly by measuring the spin susceptibility @xmath5 .",
    "quite generally , @xmath5 has been found to grow over its pauli value @xmath6 with increasing @xmath7 , the growth depending markedly on the device hosting the 2des . for the si ( 100 )",

    "however , pudalov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have ruled out the possibility of such an instability for densities down to the mit , though admittedly in different samples .",
    "a qualitatively similar result has been found for 2d electrons in the alas / gaas based heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the role of the valley degree of freedom @xmath8 has also been explored @xcite and , contrary to common expectation ( based on hartree - fock ) , the spin susceptibility enhancement @xmath9 in the two - valley ( 2v ) state is found to be smaller than the one - valley ( 1v ) result .",
    "note however that , at least at high density the spin susceptibility @xmath5 of the 2v system is indeed larger than the 1v one .",
    "apart from this , the recent qmc simulations of the 2v2des due to marchi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the spin properties undergo a qualitative change with @xmath8 .",
    "notably , the 2v2des did not support the spin - polarization transition , a finding at variance with the 1v qmc result @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with the experimental indication of a diverging spin susceptibility found by shashkin _",
    "@xcite , on the contrary , is naturally ascribed to absence of disorder in the qmc simulations . in ref .",

    "since the measurement of @xmath5 , there have been theoretical attempts @xcite to elucidate the experimental data .",
    "the qmc simulations @xcite have so far been performed only for an ideal ( i.e. , zero transverse thickness ) 2des . however , the device - specific parameters such as the transverse thickness of the electron layer , valley degeneracy etc . , have been shown @xcite to have an appreciable effect on @xmath5 . theoretically , the main problem has consisted in treating the electron correlations , thus making the use of approximations inevitable . first determined the spin properties beyond the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) by numerically evaluating the sum of ring diagrams .",
    "zhang and das sarma @xcite recently used the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to deal with the correlations .",
    "the correlations were found to introduce quantitative as well as qualitative changes in the ground state .",
    "particularly , the critical @xmath7 for transition to the ferromagnetic phase increased both for the 1v and 2v states , and the 2v @xmath9 now lays below the 1v result as in simulations @xcite and experiment@xcite .",
    "davoudi and tosi @xcite went beyond the rpa by including the short - range correlations within the self - consistent mean - field theory of singwi , tosi , land , and sjlander ( stls)@xcite , but they restricted their study to an ideal 1v2des model . the ferromagnetic instability was found to occur at almost the same @xmath7 ( @xmath14 ) as in the rpa .",
    "however , the ground - state energy for the partially spin - polarized states could be computed only up to @xmath15 due to the appearance of an unphysical instability and accordingly , the fate of these states was not clear for @xmath16 .",
    "although no direct comparison with the rpa was drawn , yet it is known that the rpa is accurate only at low @xmath7 .",
    "a theoretical study of the spin properties of a 2des by taking into account the correlations and the device details ( the transverse thickness and the valley degeneracy ) makes the main aim of the present work .",
    "the correlations will be treated at the level of stls approximation .",
    "the stls has been used previously to study these effects @xcite , but only in the unpolarized phase .",
    "firstly , we intend to examine the ground state for its stability with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath8 by comparing the ground - state energy in different states .",
    "secondly , we shall extract @xmath5 from the @xmath10 dependence of ground - state energy . to assess the role of device details ,",
    "@xmath5 will be calculated for three different experimentally studied devices , namely , the si ( 100 ) inversion layer @xcite , the alas quantum well ( qw ) @xcite , and the gaas heterojunction - insulated gate field - effect transistor ( higfet ) @xcite .",

    "however , the electrons in actual devices are trapped in a finite qw along the transverse direction , which results in a multi - subband 2des having a finite transverse thickness .",
    "quite often , it is reasonable to assume that the electrons occupy only the lowest energy subband . under these conditions",

    "once again we note that the inclusion of the finite width of the 2des brings the stls predictions closer to the experiment .",
    "however , the alas qw being much narrower exhibits comparatively smaller suppression due to finite thickness and the agreement is much less satisfactory than for the si ( 100 ) system , both for the alas qw and the gaas higfet .",
    "interestingly , the quality of the stls predictions is different in three systems .",
    "this seems to suggest that it might be important to include other device specific parameters like disorder @xcite .",
    "moreover , the choice of confining potential is expected to affect the form factor and hence , the interaction potential ; for instance , taking a finite ( alas ) qw model would result in a softer potential and therefore , in suppression of @xmath5 over the infinite qw result .",
    "likewise , in the inversion layer model stern and howard @xcite did not consider the exchange - correlation effects in calculating the interface electronic eigenfunctions .",
    "later on ando @xcite found that these effects reduce the width of inversion layer , which in turn is expected to enhance @xmath5 .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the spin properties of a 2des , as realized at the interface of semiconductor - insulator / semiconductor heterojunctions , by using the stls approach .",
    "the si ( 100 ) inversion layer has been studied in detail to calculate the spin - resolved static structure factors and the ground - state energy at arbitrary @xmath10 over a wide range of @xmath7 .",
    "we deduce quite generally that the stls theory fails in determining the spin - resolved correlations above a critical @xmath7 due to the appearance of unphysical poles in @xmath102 , i.e. , at imaginary frequency .",
    "such poles , however , may be shown to not contribute to the frequency integral of @xmath167 yielding the structure factors , which can still be computed , and the spin summed properties ( such as the charge - charge structure factor ) remain reliable and close to the available qmc simulation data",
    ".    this enabled us to determine the ground - state energy over a wide range of @xmath7 at arbitrary @xmath10 and hence , the stable spin phase .",
    "for the quasi si ( 100 ) system , the unpolarized 2v phase is found to represent the ground state for @xmath168 and thereafter , a first - order transition occurs to the polarized 1v phase .",
    "the predicted ground state for @xmath168 agrees with the experiment of pudalov _",
    "et al._@xcite furthermore , the calculated spin susceptibility agrees fairly well with the experiment , but only with the inclusion of transverse thickness and valley degeneracy , provided one does not come too close to the apparent ferromagnetic instability found in ref . .    without thickness",
    "we find that stls sizeably overestimates the spin susceptibility , both for the 1v and 2v states , a drawback in common with rpa@xcite .",
    "the spin susceptibility has also been calculated for the 2dess as realized in the alas qw and the gaas higfet .",
    "we find that agreement with experiment is much less satisfactory in these cases , even though it is somewhat improved by the inclusion of thickness .",
    "for the ideal ( i.e. , zero thickness ) 2des model , the stls theory reproduces nicely the recent qmc correlation energy at arbitrary @xmath10 both for the 1v and 2v states .",
    "however , the agreement is seen to depend qualitatively on @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "particularly , the correlation energy is overestimated for the 1v state at @xmath132 , whereas it is underestimated for the 2v state both at @xmath94 and at @xmath169 .",
    "although the magnitude of deviation from the qmc data is small , yet this being of opposite sign causes simultaneous valley- and spin - polarization at @xmath139 , a prediction in gross violation of the qmc study .",
    "an analysis of the correlation contribution to the spin - resolved interaction energy reveals that the stls theory is relatively less accurate in handling the like - spin correlations .",
    "this result may have bearing on the further development of the theory of electron correlation .",
