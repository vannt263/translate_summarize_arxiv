    "the hera collider , where 27.5 gev electrons collide with 920 gev protons , is considered a natural extension of rutherford s experiment and the process of deep inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( dis ) is interpreted as a reaction in which a virtual photon , radiated by the incoming electron , probes the structure of the proton . in this talk",
    "i would like to discuss this interpretation and ask the question of who is probing whom  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the talk will be the following : it will start with posing the problem , after which our knowledge about the structure of the proton as seen at hera  @xcite will be presented followed by a description of our present understanding of the structure of the photon as seen at hera and at lep  @xcite .",
    "next , an answer to the question posed in the title will be suggested and the talk will be concluded by some remarks about the nature of the interaction between the virtual photon and the proton  @xcite .",
    "the process of dis is usually represented by the diagram shown in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "if the lepton does not change its identity during the scattering process , the reaction is labeled neutral current ( nc ) , as either a virtual photon or a @xmath1 boson can be exchanged . when the identity of the lepton changes in the process , the reaction is called charged current ( cc ) and",
    "a charged @xmath2 boson is exchanged . during this talk",
    "we will discuss only nc processes .    using the four vectors as indicated in the figure",
    ", one can define the usual dis variables : @xmath3 , the virtuality of the exchanged boson , @xmath4 , the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the interacting parton , @xmath5 , the inelasticity , and @xmath6 , the boson - proton center of mass energy squared .",
    "the interpretation of the diagram describing a nc event is the following .",
    "the electron beam is a source of photons with virtuality @xmath7 .",
    "these virtual photons ` look ' at the proton . any ` observed ' structure belongs to the proton .",
    "how can we be sure that we are indeed measuring the structure of the proton ?",
    "virtual photons have no structure .",
    "is that always true ?",
    "we know that real photons have structure ; we even measure the photon structure function @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss this point further in the next subsections .",
    "how is it possible that the photon , which is the gauge particle mediating the electromagnetic interactions , has a hadronic structure ?",
    "ioffe s argument  @xcite : the photon can fluctuate into @xmath9 pairs just like it fluctuates into @xmath10 pairs ( see figure  [ fig : fluc ] ) . if the fluctuation time , defined in the proton rest frame as @xmath11 , is much larger than the interaction time , @xmath12 , the photon builds up structure in the interaction . here , @xmath13 is the energy of the fluctuating photon , @xmath14 is the mass into which it fluctuates , and @xmath15 is the radius of the proton .    the hadronic structure of the photon , built during the interaction ,",
    "can be studied by measuring the photon structure function @xmath8 in a dis type of experiment where a quasi - real photon is probed by a virtual photon , both of which are emitted in @xmath10 collisions , as described in figure  [ fig : dis - photon ] .",
    "this diagram is very similar to that in dis on a proton target ( figure  [ fig : kinematics ] ) .",
    "does a virtual photon also fluctuate and acquire a hadronic structure ?",
    "the fluctuation time of a photon with virtuality @xmath7 is given by @xmath16 , and thus at very high @xmath7 one does not expect the condition @xmath17 to hold .",
    "however at very large photon energies , or at very low @xmath18 , the fluctuation time is independent of @xmath7 : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the proton mass , and thus even highly virtual photons can acquire structure .",
    "for instance , at hera presently @xmath21 200 - 300 gev , and since @xmath22 , @xmath18 can be as low as 0.01 even for @xmath7 = 1000 gev@xmath23 . in this case",
    ", the fluctuation time will be very large compared to the interaction time and the highly virtual photon will acquire a hadronic structure .",
    "how do we interprate the dis diagram of figure  [ fig : kinematics ] in this case ? whose structure do we measure ?",
    "do we measure the structure of the proton , from the viewpoint of the proton infinite momentum frame , or do we measure the structure of the virtual photon , from the proton rest frame view ? who is probing whom ?    when asked this question , bjorken answered  @xcite that physics can not be frame dependent and therefore it does nt matter : we can say that we measure the structure of the proton or we can say that we study the structure of the virtual photon .",
    "i will try to convince you at the end of my talk that this answer makes sense .",
    "in this section we will refrain from discussing the question posed above and will accept the interpretation of measuring the structure of the proton via the dis diagram in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "we present below information about the structure of the proton as seen from the dis studies at hera .      with the advent of the hera @xmath0 collider",
    "the kinematic plane of @xmath18-@xmath7 has been extended by 2 orders of magnitude in both variables from the existing fixed target dis experiments , as depicted in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "the dis cross section for @xmath24 can be written ( for @xmath25 ) as  @xcite , @xmath26 in the quark - parton model ( qpm ) , the proton structure function @xmath27 is only a function of @xmath18 and can be expressed as a sum of parton densities , and is related to @xmath28 through the callan - gross relation  @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electric charge of quark @xmath31 and the index @xmath31 runs over all the quark flavours .",
    "note that in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the callan - gross relation is violated , and the structure function is a function of @xmath18 and @xmath7 , @xmath32 where the longitudinal structure function @xmath33 contributes in an important way only at large @xmath34 .",
    "the motivation for measuring @xmath35 can be summarized as follows : ( a ) test",
    "the validity of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations , ( b ) decompose the proton into quarks and gluons , and ( c ) search for proton substructure .",
    "quarks radiate gluons ; gluons split and produce more gluons at low @xmath18 and also @xmath9 pairs at low @xmath18 .",
    "this qcd evolution chain is usually described in leading order by splitting functions @xmath36 , as shown in figure  [ fig : splitting ] .",
    "this procedure leads to scaling violation in the following way : there is an increase of @xmath27 with @xmath7 at low @xmath18 and a decrease at high @xmath18 .",
    "scaling holds at about @xmath18=0.1 .",
    "the data follows this prediction of qcd , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sc - viol ] .",
    "the fixed target experiments provided information at relatively high @xmath18 and thus enabled the study of the behaviour of valence quarks .",
    "the first hera results showed a surprisingly strong rise of @xmath27 as @xmath18 decreases .",
    "an example of such a rise is given in figure  [ fig : f2-over ] where @xmath27 increases as @xmath18 decreases , for a fixed value of @xmath7 = 15 gev@xmath23 .",
    "this increase is the result of the rising gluon density at low @xmath18 .",
    "note the good agreement between both hera experiments , h1 and zeus , and also between hera and the fixed target data .",
    "the measurements of @xmath27 as function of @xmath18 and @xmath7 can be used to obtain information about the parton densities in the proton .",
    "this is done by using the pqcd dglap evolution equations .",
    "one can not calculate everything from first principles but needs as input from the experiment the parton densities at a scale @xmath37 , usually taken as a few gev@xmath23 , above which pqcd is believed to be applicable .",
    "there are several groups which perform qcd fits , the most notable are mrst  @xcite and cteq  @xcite .",
    "they parameterize the @xmath18 dependence of the parton densities at @xmath37 in the form , @xmath38 the free parameters like @xmath39 and @xmath40 are adjusted to fit the data for @xmath41 .",
    "an example of such an evolution study can be seen in figure  [ fig : f2 - 94 ] where the @xmath27 data are presented as function of @xmath18 for fixed @xmath7 values .",
    "the increase of @xmath27 with decreasing @xmath18 is seen over the whole range of measured @xmath7 values .",
    "the pqcd fits give a good description of the data down to surprisingly low @xmath7 values .",
    "the resulting parton densities from the mrst parameterization at @xmath7 = 20 gev@xmath23 are shown in figure  [ fig : mrst - partons ] .",
    "one sees the dominance of the @xmath42 valence quark at high @xmath18 and the sharp rise of the sea quarks at low @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the gluon density at low @xmath18 rises very sharply and has a value of more than 20 gluons per unit of rapidity at @xmath43 . in figure",
    "[ fig : h1-gluon-9697 ] one sees the extracted gluon density by the h1 experiment  @xcite at three different @xmath7 values .",
    "the density of the gluons at a given low @xmath18 increases strongly with @xmath7 .",
    "the rate of the rise of @xmath27 with decreasing @xmath18 is @xmath7 dependent .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : f2-x - rise ] where @xmath27 is plotted as a function of @xmath18 for three @xmath7 values .",
    "the rate of rise decreases as @xmath7 gets smaller .",
    "what can we say about the rate of rise ? to what can one compare it ?",
    "the proton structure function @xmath27 is related to the total @xmath44 cross section @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the approximate sign holds for low @xmath18 .",
    "since we have a better feeling for the behaviour of the total cross section with energy , we plot in figure  [ fig : allm97 ] the @xmath27 data converted to @xmath45 as function of @xmath47 for fixed values of @xmath7 . for comparison we plot also the total @xmath48 cross section .",
    "one sees that the shallow @xmath49 behaviour of the total @xmath48 cross section changes to a steeper behaviour as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the curves are the results of the allm97  @xcite parameterization ( see below ) which gives a good description of the transition seen in the data .",
    "the data presented above show a clear change of the @xmath49 dependence with @xmath7 . at @xmath7=0",
    "the processes are dominantly non - perturbative and the resulting reactions are usually named as ` soft ' physics .",
    "this domain is well described in the regge picture . as @xmath7 increases",
    ", the exchanged photon is expected to shrink and one expects pqcd to take over .",
    "the reactions are said to be ` hard ' .",
    "where does the transition from soft to hard physics take place ?",
    "is it a smooth or abrupt one ? in the following we describe two parameterizations , one fully based on the regge picture while the other combines the regge approach with a qcd motivated one .",
    "donnachie and landshoff ( dl )  @xcite succeeded to describe all existing hadron - proton total cross section data in a simple regge picture by using a combination of a pomeron and a reggeon exchange , the former rising slowly while the latter decreasing with energy , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the square of the total center of mass energy .",
    "the two numerical parameter , related to the intercepts @xmath52 of the pomeron and reggeon trajectories , respectively , are the result of fitting this simple expression to all available data , some of which are shown in the first two plots in figure  [ fig : dl - tot ] .",
    "these parameters give also a good description of the total @xmath48 cross section data which were not used in the fit and are also shown on the right hand side of the figure .",
    "donnachie and landshoff wanted to extend this picture also to virtual photons  @xcite ( for @xmath5310 gev@xmath23 ) , keeping the power of @xmath47 , which is related to the pomeron intercept , fixed with @xmath7 .",
    "their motivation was to see what is the expected contribution from non - perturbative physics , or soft physics as we called it above , at higher @xmath7 .",
    "the other example is that of abramowicz , levin , levy , maor ( allm )  @xcite , which was updated by abramowicz and levy ( allm97 )  @xcite .",
    "this parameterization uses a regge motivated approach at low @xmath18 together with a qcd motivated one at high @xmath18 to parameterize the whole ( @xmath54 ) phase space , fitting all existing @xmath27 data .",
    "this parameterization uses a so - called interplay of soft and hard physics ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the two parameterizations are compared  @xcite to the low @xmath7 hera data together with that of the fixed target e665 experiment in figure  [ fig : sig97 ] . here",
    "one sees again how the cross section changes from a @xmath55 behaviour at very low @xmath7 to a @xmath56 as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the simple dl parameterization as implemented by zeus ( zeusregge in the figure ) fails to describe the data above @xmath57 1 gev@xmath23 .",
    "allm97 describes the data well in the whole region .",
    "dl98  @xcite , which adds to the soft pomeron an additional hard pomeron , can also describe the data , but loses the simplicity of the original dl one .",
    "one can quantify the change in the rate of increase by using the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath59 this implies that @xmath60 .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath58 as function of @xmath7 is shown in figure  [ fig : lam ] for the zeus  @xcite ( upper ) and the h1  @xcite ( lower ) experiments .",
    "one sees a clear increase of @xmath58 with @xmath7 which can not be reproduced by the simple regge picture but needs an approach in which there is the interplay of soft and hard physics  @xcite .",
    "let us summarize what we have learned so far about the structure of the proton .    * the density of partons in the proton increases with decreasing @xmath18 . *",
    "the rate of increase is @xmath7 dependent ; at high @xmath7 the increase follows the expectations from the pqcd hard physics while at low @xmath7 the rate is described by the soft physics behaviour expected by the regge phenomenology . *",
    "though there seems to be a transition in the region of @xmath57 1 - 2 gev@xmath23 , there is an interplay between the soft and hard physics in both regions .",
    "in this part we will describe what is presently known about the structure of the photon , both from @xmath10 experiments as well as from hera .",
    "the hadronic structure function of the photon , @xmath8 , was measured in @xmath10 collisions which can be interpreted as depicted in figure  [ fig : dis - photon ] . a highly virtual @xmath61 with large @xmath7 probes a quasi - real @xmath62 with @xmath63 0 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath8 showed a different behaviour than that of the proton structure function . from the @xmath7 dependence , shown in figure  [ fig : gscaling ]  @xcite",
    ", one sees positive scaling violation for all @xmath18 .",
    "this different behaviour can be understood as coming from an additional splitting to the ones present in the proton case ( see figure  [ fig : splitting ] ) . in the photon case ,",
    "the photon can split into a @xmath9 pair , @xmath64 .",
    "the contribution resulting from this splitting , called the ` box diagram ' , causes positive scaling violation for all @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , and again contrary to the proton case , it also causes the photon structure function to be large for high @xmath18 values , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : f2 g ] where @xmath8 is plotted as function of @xmath18 for fixed @xmath7 values . from this figure",
    "one can also see that there exist very little data in the low @xmath18 region .      at hera",
    ", the structure of the photon can be studied by selecting events in which the exchanged photon is quasi - real and the probe is provided by a large transverse momentum parton from the proton .",
    "the probed photon can participate in the process in two ways . in one ,",
    "the interaction takes place before it fluctuates into a @xmath9 pair and thus the whole of the photon participates in the interaction .",
    "such a process is called a ` direct ' photon interaction . in the other case",
    ", the photon first fluctuates into partons and only one of these partons participates in the interaction while the rest continue as the photon remnant .",
    "this process is said to be a ` resolved ' photon interaction .",
    "an example of leading order diagrams describing dijet photoproduction for the two processes is shown in figure  [ fig : direct - resolved ] .",
    "if one defines a variable @xmath65 as the fraction of the photon momentum taking part in a dijet process , we expect @xmath66 1 in the direct case , while @xmath67 1 in the resolved photon interaction .",
    "these two processes are clearly seen in figure  [ fig : xg ] where the @xmath65 distribution shows a two peak structure , one coming from the direct photon and the other from the resolved photon interactions  @xcite .",
    "one way of obtaining information about @xmath8 from hera is to measure the dijet photoproduction as function of @xmath65 and to subtract the contribution coming from the direct photon reactions .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : f2g - hera ] ,    where the measurements are presented at fixed values of the hard scale , which is taken as the highest transverse energy jet  @xcite .",
    "one can go one step further by assuming leading order qcd and monte carlo ( mc ) models to extract the effective parton densities in the photon .",
    "an example of the extracted gluon density in the photon  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : gh1 ] .",
    "the gluon density increases with decreasing @xmath18 , a similar behaviour to that of the gluon density in the proton .",
    "the data have the potential of differentiating between different parameterization of the parton densities in the photon , as can be seen in the same figure .",
    "one can study the structure of virtual photons in a similar way as described above . in this case",
    ", the @xmath7 of the virtual photon has to be much smaller than the transverse energy squared of the jet , @xmath68 , which provides the hard scale of the probe .",
    "such a study  @xcite is presented in figure  [ fig : virt - h1 ] , where the dijet cross section is plotted as function of @xmath65 for different regions in @xmath7 and @xmath68 .",
    "one sees a clear excess over the expectation of direct photon reactions , indicating that virtual photons also have a resolved part .",
    "this fact can also been seen in figure  [ fig : virt - zeus ] where the ratio of resolved to direct photon interactions is plotted as function of the virtuality @xmath7 of the probed photon  @xcite .",
    "one sees that although the ratio decreases with @xmath7 , it remains non - zero even at relatively high @xmath7 values .",
    "the study of the structure of virtual photons in @xmath10 reactions was dormant for more than 15 years following the measurement done by the pluto collaboration  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the l3 collaboration at lep  @xcite measured the structure function of photons with a virtuality of 3.7 gev@xmath23 , using as probes photons with a virtuality of 120 gev@xmath23 .    in the same experiment ,",
    "the structure function of real photons was also measured .",
    "both results can be seen in figure  [ fig : virtlep1 ] and within errors the structure function of the virtual photons is of the same order of magnitude as that of the real ones .",
    "the effective structure function is also presented as function of the virtuality of the probed photon @xmath69 in figure  [ fig : virtlep2 ] and show very little dependence on @xmath69 up to values of @xmath70 6 gev@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "let us summarize what we have learned so far about the structure of the photon .",
    "* at hera one can see clear signals of the 2-component structure of quasi - real photons , a direct and a resolved part .",
    "* virtual photons can also have a resolved part at low @xmath18 and fluctuate into @xmath9 pairs .",
    "* structure of virtual photons has been seen also at lep .",
    "following the two sections on the structure of the proton and the photon , let us remind ourselves again what our original question was . at low @xmath18",
    "we have seen that a @xmath61 can have structure .",
    "does it still probe the proton in an @xmath0 dis experiment or does one of the partons of the proton probe the structure of the @xmath61 ?",
    "the answer is just as bjorken said : at low @xmath18 it does not matter .",
    "both interpretation are correct .",
    "the emphasis is however ` at low @xmath18 ' . at low @xmath18",
    "the structure functions of the proton and of the photon can be related through gribov factorization  @xcite . by measuring one , the other",
    "can be obtained from it through a simple relation .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "gribov showed  @xcite that the @xmath71 , @xmath48 and @xmath72 total cross sections can be related by regge factorization as follows : @xmath73 this relation can be extended  @xcite to the case where one photon is real and the other is virtual , @xmath74 or to the case where both photons are virtual , @xmath75    since at low @xmath18 one has @xmath76 , one gets the following relations between the proton structure function @xmath77 , the structure function of a real photon , @xmath8 , and that of a virtual photon , @xmath78 : @xmath79 and @xmath80 the relation given in equation  ( [ eq : fact ] ) has been used  @xcite to ` produce ' @xmath8 ` data ' from well measured @xmath77 data in the region of @xmath810.01 , where the gribov factorization is expected to hold .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : newf2 ] together with direct measurements of @xmath8 .",
    "since no direct measurements exist in the very low @xmath18 region for @xmath82 gev@xmath23 , it is difficult to test the relation .",
    "however both data sets have been used for a global qcd leading order and higher order fits  @xcite to obtain parton distributions in the photon . clearly there is a need of more precise direct @xmath8 data for such a study .    in any case",
    ", our answer to the question would be that at low @xmath18 the virtual photon and the proton probe the structure of each other .",
    "in fact , what one probes is the structure of the interaction . at high @xmath18 , the virtual photon can be assumed to be structureless and it studies the structure of the proton .",
    "we concluded in the last section that at low @xmath18 one studies the structure of the interaction .",
    "let us discuss this point more clearly .",
    "we saw that in case of the proton at low @xmath18 , the density of the partons increases with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "where are the partons located ? in the proton rest frame , bjorken @xmath18 is directly related to the space coordinate of the parton .",
    "the distance @xmath83 in the direction of the exchanged photon is given by  @xcite , @xmath84 therefore partons with @xmath850.1 are in the interior of the proton , while all partons with @xmath810.1 have no direct relation to the structure of the proton .",
    "the low @xmath18 partons describe the properties of the @xmath44 interaction .",
    "how can we describe a @xmath44 interaction at low @xmath18 ?",
    "it occurs in two steps : first the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath9 pair and then the configuration of this pair determines if the interaction is ` soft ' or ` hard '  @xcite .",
    "the soft process is the result of a large spatial configuration in which the photon fluctuates into an asymmetric small @xmath86 @xmath9 pair .",
    "the hard nature of the interaction is obtain when the fluctuation is into a small configuration of a symmetric @xmath9 pair with large @xmath86 .",
    "the two configurations are shown in figure  [ fig : ajm ] .    at @xmath7=0",
    "the asymmetric configuration is dominant and the large color forces produce a hadronic component which interacts with the proton and leads to hadronic non - perturbative soft physics .",
    "the symmetric component contributes very little ; the high @xmath86 configuration is screened by color transparency ( ct ) . at higher @xmath7 the contribution of the symmetric small configuration",
    "gets bigger .",
    "each one still contributes little because of ct , but the phase space for such configurations increases .",
    "nevertheless , the asymmetric large configuration is also still contributing and thus both soft and hard components are present . another way to see",
    "this interplay is by looking at the diagram in figure  [ fig : dis - ajm ] . in a simple qpm picture of dis ,",
    "the fast quark from the asymmetric configuration becomes the current jet while the slow quark interacts with the proton in a soft process .",
    "thus the dis process looks in the @xmath44 frame just like the @xmath7=0 case .",
    "this brings the interplay of soft and hard processes .",
    "* in dis experiments at low @xmath18 one studies the ` structure ' of the @xmath44 interaction . * in order to study the interior structure of the proton , one needs to measure the high @xmath18 high @xmath7 region .",
    "this will be done at hera after the high luminosity upgrade .",
