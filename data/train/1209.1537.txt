    "during the last decade , significant progress on the electromagnetic excitation of nucleon resonances has been obtained . for pion and eta photoproduction very precise data of unpolarized cross sections and photon asymmetries",
    "were measured at mami@mainz , elsa@bonn , legs@brookhaven and graal@grenoble . for electroproduction , at mainz , bonn and bates",
    "measurements for the @xmath1 excitation were performed at low @xmath2 , and for higher @xmath2 up to about @xmath3  gev@xmath4 , at jlab a very large amount of data was collected in an energy range up to the third nucleon resonance region .    in parallel with the ongoing experiments , several theoretical groups developed models and analysis techniques , which were applied to the data .",
    "the model - independent gwu / said analysis  @xcite mostly analyzed the pion photoproduction data and improved the values of the photon couplings over the years .",
    "coupled channels analyses were performed by the giessen group  @xcite and by the bonn - gatchina group  @xcite .",
    "transition amplitudes were also determined in the framework of dynamically generated resonances by coupling to meson - baryon channels by the jlich  @xcite and ebac  @xcite groups .    however , most successful concerning the general applicability to the higher resonances , were the unitary isobar models of the mainz group ( maid model )  @xcite and of the jlab group  @xcite who used dispersion relations as an additional constraint to reduce the model dependence due to incomplete experimental input .",
    "with our unitary isobar model maid , we analyzed all available electroproduction data in order to determine the transition form factors for all four - star resonances below @xmath5  gev .",
    "in most cases we could obtain both single-@xmath2 and @xmath2 dependent transition form factors for the proton target . in the case of the neutron ,",
    "the parametrization of the @xmath2 dependence had to take a simpler form because of the much smaller world database .",
    "single-@xmath2 data points for longitudinal and transverse form factors have been obtained for transitions from the proton to the @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which can be downloaded from the maid website  @xcite . here only results for the @xmath9 , and the @xmath10 are shown .",
    "full results and details of the parameterizations are given in our recent review article , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main motivation for exploring the nucleon transition form factors is to obtain a precise knowledge of the nucleon excitation spectrum , which provides  together with the elastic form factors  a complete description of the nucleon s electromagnetic structure .",
    "this structure can be compared with qcd inspired quark models and , in recent years , more and more also with lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the @xmath1 is the only nucleon resonance with a well - defined breit - wigner resonance position , @xmath11  mev .",
    "it is an ideal single - channel resonance , the watson theorem applies , and the breit - wigner position coincides with the k - matrix pole position . for these reasons",
    ", the @xmath12 form factors can be determined in an essentially model independent way . the magnetic form factor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p33ffs ] is very well known already from inelastic electron scattering up to high momentum transfer , @xmath13  gev@xmath4 , and can be parameterized in a surprisingly simple form found in our previous maid analysis , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the standard dipole form factor of the nucleon .",

    "@xcite.,width=453 ]    the electric and coulomb form factors are much smaller and are usually given as ratios of @xmath21 and @xmath17 to the magnetic form factor in percent .",
    "figure  [ fig : p33ffs ] also compares the maid2007 solutions ( solid lines ) for the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 with other analyses .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 from maid2007 stays always below the zero line , in agreement with the original analysis of the data  @xcite and also with the dynamical model of sato and lee  @xcite who concluded that @xmath22 remains negative and tends towards more negative values with increasing @xmath2 instead of an uprise towards unity .",
    "this indicates that the predicted helicity conservation at the quark level is irrelevant for the present experimental @xmath2 range . for the ratio @xmath23",
    "our @xmath2 dependent fit approaches a negative constant for large @xmath2 in good agreement with the predictions of ji et al .",
    "@xcite , buchmann  @xcite and ramalho et al .",
    "@xcite , who use a relation between the ratio @xmath23 and the ratio of the electric and magnetic neutron form factors . for @xmath24 our maid2007 single-@xmath2 analysis for @xmath23 disagrees with the jlab analysis of aznauryan",
    "whereas our analysis stays almost constant , the jlab analysis suggests a much larger negative slope . by repeating our data analysis at @xmath25 and @xmath3  gev@xmath4 in different energy ranges",
    ", we found a strong dependence of the fit on the energy interval used .",
    "our results of 2007 were obtained with the full energy range of the measured data , @xmath26  mev .",
    "figure  [ fig : p33ffs ] also shows an analysis ( blue open circles ) in the energy range of @xmath27  mev , much closer to the resonance position . if we choose the energy interval even closer to resonance , @xmath28mev , the errors increase further by a factor of 2 and the @xmath18 ratio becomes large and positive , while the @xmath19 ratio remains the same .",
    "we conclude that the analysis in this @xmath2 range strongly depends on the energy interval and the parametrization of the background used in the analysis and requires further studies .",

    "also the said and bonn - gatchina groups extract values around 100 , but in a very recent analysis , based on pion photoproduction , shrestha and manley report , however , also a small coupling of @xmath41  @xcite .    from the @xmath2",
