    "the bulk orbital am in chiral superconductors ( scs ) has been intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "a chiral sc is an exotic sc whose cooper pairs carry nonzero orbital am @xmath6 , and hence the time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "@xmath7he - a is the only material experimentally established as a chiral superfluid , whose pairing symmetry is chiral @xmath8 wave  @xcite .",
    "also , sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 is widely believed to be a chiral @xmath8-wave sc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , most of the previous studies have focused on chiral @xmath8 wave and at least theoretically concluded @xmath11 in an ideal situation , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the bulk orbital am and the total number of particles at zero temperature , respectively  @xcite . in general ,",
    "chiral scs with @xmath6 are expected to have @xmath12 without an edge or a vortex  @xcite , which we call the intrinsic value .",
    "recently , it was found that the bulk orbital am in two - dimensional chiral scs with @xmath13 is remarkably reduced as @xmath14  @xcite . in two dimensions , chiral scs",
    "are gapped and are topological scs characterized by the chern number @xmath15 and the presence of the majorana edge states . when @xmath16 , only one edge state is particle - hole symmetric ( phs ) by itself and",
    "is called the phs edge state  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath13 is even , each edge state is phs with another but not phs by itself .",
    "such edge states are called the non - phs edge states  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is odd , there are the phs and non - phs edge states .",
    "the non - phs edge states give rise to the nonzero spectral asymmetry and reduce the bulk orbital am from the intrinsic value @xmath12 .",
    "although chiral @xmath17 or @xmath3 wave has been proposed in upt@xmath18  @xcite , uru@xmath9si@xmath9  @xcite , and srptas  @xcite , the theory can not be applied to these three - dimensional materials with nodes directly .",
    "apparently , the above reduction of the bulk orbital am requires not @xmath13 but @xmath19 .",
    "realization of two - dimensional time - reversal broken topological scs with @xmath19 is classified into two types .",
    "the first type is intrinsic , namely , without impurities , and can be realized in a quantum anomalous hall insulator in proximity to an @xmath0-wave sc  @xcite , a heterostructure of a hole - doped semiconductor thin film , a magnetic insulator , and an @xmath0-wave sc  @xcite , and the systems with the help of @xmath8-wave scs  @xcite .",
    "the second type relies on impurities and can be realized in a lattice of magnetic impurities on the surface of an @xmath0-wave sc with the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi )  @xcite and that of nonmagnetic impurities in a chiral @xmath8-wave sc  @xcite .",
    "in these proposals , arbitrarily high chern numbers are available in principle . in return for using a conventional @xmath0-wave sc , sois play an important role in generating the effective chirality of cooper pairs . among these proposals , a hole - doped topological sc proposed in ref .",
    "is a natural extension of an electron - doped topological sc composed of an electron - doped semiconductor thin film , a magnetic insulator , and an @xmath0-wave sc  @xcite and offers an experimentally feasible system to verify the theory of the bulk orbital am .",
    "we note that hole - doped semiconductors accompanied by ferromagnetism can be realized by mn doping and are called dilute magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not trivial how the bulk orbital am is reduced in this system because the orbital am is not conserved in the presence of the sois .    in this paper , we investigate the bulk orbital am in a hole - doped topological sc  @xcite comparing with that in an electron - doped topological sc  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the bulk orbital am both by the green s function formula  @xcite and on a circular disk . as mentioned above",
    ", the non - phs edge states dramatically reduce the bulk orbital am in the case of @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , tsutumi and machida pointed out that @xmath11 in chiral @xmath8-wave scs consists of @xmath20 from the majorana edge state and @xmath21 from the continuum states  @xcite .",
    "the authors already found that @xmath2 in an electron - doped topological sc is continuous at the topological phase transition and is nonzero even in the trivial phase which does not support the majorana edge state  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to reveal the difference of the contributions to the bulk orbital am from the phs edge , non - phs edge , and continuum states .",
    "we also discuss the effects of the sois which are indispensable for topological scs .",
    "we find that the conserved quantity is modified by sois . when the chern number is higher than @xmath22 , it can be nonzero owing to the presence of the non - phs edge states and the nonzero spectral asymmetry , which results in the reduction of the bulk orbital am as shown in refs .  .",
    "since the bulk orbital am calculated in the reciprocal space is continuous at the topological phase transition , that calculated in the real space shows a jump . differently from the existing literature ,",

    "see ref .   for the hamiltonian and the other parameters we set .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : rashbatsc - radial ] , we show the radial distributions @xmath171 and @xmath172 . for @xmath173 , the phs edge contribution @xmath171 in fig .  [",
    "fig : rashbatsc - radial](b ) and the continuum contribution @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rashbatsc - radial](c ) are negative and positive , respectively , which is consistent with the previous result obtained by the quasiclassical eilenberger theory  @xcite .",
    "however , we can not find any significant difference between before and after the topological phase transition .",
    "the @xmath174 eigenstate , which goes down toward @xmath125 and turns into the phs edge state for @xmath175 , is already localized at the edge even for @xmath176 and has the negative orbital am .",
    "therefore , as @xmath177 from the phs edge state in a chiral @xmath8-wave sc is expected to be fragile against the edge roughness  @xcite , not only the orbital am from the phs edge state in the topological phase but also that from one of the continuum states in the trivial phase is expected to be fragile .",
    "now let us move on to a hole - doped topological sc .",
    "figure  [ fig : luttingertsc - radial ] shows the radial distributions @xmath164 .",
    "we set @xmath178 to avoid the accidental gap closing at @xmath53 and to focus on its chiral @xmath3-wave behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fig : luttingertsc - radial](b ) , the orbital am of the @xmath179 eigenstate , which turns into the phs edge state for @xmath112 , shows no significant difference between before and after the topological phase transition as in an electron - doped topological sc . on the other hand , the radial distribution from the @xmath174 eigenstate , which goes across @xmath125 and turns into the non - phs edge state for @xmath112 , discontinuously decreases at the topological phase transition .",
    "this decrease is associated with the discontinuous reduction of the bulk orbital am @xmath180 .",
    "note that the radial distribution is not positive because this eigenstate has the negative orbital am even in the trivial phase similar to the @xmath179 eigenstate .",
    "thus the effect of the non - phs edge states can be found not in the radial distribution itself but in its change at the topological phase transition .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the bulk orbital am in a two - dimensional topological sc which is composed of a hole - doped semiconductor , a ferromagnet , and an @xmath0-wave sc and is characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath114 by using the green s function formula of the hall viscosity in the reciprocal space and @xmath113 by solving the bdg equation on a circular disk .",
    "our findings are as follows : ( 1 ) before the topological phase transition , @xmath156 starts to increase as in an electron - doped topological sc  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath181 , @xmath113 is reduced from @xmath114 almost to zero owing to the non - phs edge states with the large fermi am , which is expected from the recent studies on chiral scs with @xmath13  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath113 is nonmonotonic as a function of the zeeman interaction .",
    "( 3 ) in the opposite case , the fermi am of the non - phs edge states becomes small associated with the lifshitz transition in the normal state , and the reduction of the bulk orbital am does not work .",
    "( 4 ) this effect competes with the other effect to tilt spins and suppress the bulk orbital am . thus a hole - doped topological sc offers an experimentally feasible stage to investigate the bulk orbital am in chiral @xmath3-wave scs and the interesting deviations due to the sois .",
    "finally , let us comment on other models of two - dimensional topological scs previously proposed .",
    "sois are the most important ingredients throughout this paper , which make the system topological and modify the conserved quantity .",
    "the models without use of sois  @xcite are out of our scope .",
    "the explicit form of the conserved quantity depends on the details of the system as studied in ref .  , but it is given by @xmath182 at least for the models in refs .",
    ". therefore we expect that our findings ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above are generic for these models with @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "our finding ( 3 ) is quite specific to a hole - doped topological sc which makes use of @xmath27 holes .",
    "we also note that the fermi am and the reduction of the bulk orbital am can be controlled by a confinement potential  @xcite .",
