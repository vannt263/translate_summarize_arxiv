    "in 1991 , davis and januszkiewicz  @xcite introduced and studied a class of @xmath2-manifolds ( called small covers ) , which belong to the topological version of toric varieties .",
    "an @xmath3-dimensional small cover @xmath4 is a closed @xmath3-manifold with a locally standard @xmath2-action such that its orbit space is a simple convex @xmath3-polytope @xmath5 . as shown in @xcite , @xmath5 naturally admits a characteristic function @xmath6 defined on the facets of @xmath5 ( here we also call @xmath6 a @xmath2-coloring on @xmath5 ) , so that the geometrical topology and the algebraic topology of the samll cover @xmath4 can be completely determined by the pair @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the davis - januszkiewicz theory for small covers indicates the following two key points :    1 .",
    "each small cover @xmath8 can be reconstructed from @xmath7 , and this reconstruction is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "thus , all small covers over a simple convex polytope @xmath5 correspond to all @xmath2-colorings on @xmath5 , i.e. , all small covers over a simple convex polytope @xmath5 are given by @xmath10 is a @xmath2-coloring on @xmath5@xmath11 .",
    "2 .   the algebraic topology of a small cover @xmath12 , such as equivariant cohomology , mod 2 betti numbers and ordinary cohomology etc . , can be explicitly expressed in terms of @xmath13 .    in the recent years",
    ", much further research on small covers has been carried on ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) . in some sense , the classification up to equivariant homeomorphism of small covers over a simple convex polytope has been understood very well .",
    "actually , this can be seen from the following two kinds of viewpoints : one is that two small covers @xmath14 and @xmath15 over a simple convex polytope @xmath5 are equivariantly homeomorphic iff there is an automorphism @xmath16 such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 induced by @xmath19 is an automorphism on all facets of @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) ; the other is that two small covers @xmath14 and @xmath15 over a simple convex polytope @xmath5 are equivariantly homeomorphic iff their equivariant cohomologies are isomorphic as @xmath20-algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in non - equivariant case , the classification up to homeomorphism of small covers over a simple convex polytope is far from understood very well except for few special polytopes ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    ".2 cm    in this paper we shall introduce an approach ( called the _ sector method _ ) of constructing homeomorphisms between two small covers .",
    "the basic idea of sector method is simply stated as follows : we first cut a @xmath21-colored simple convex @xmath3-polytope @xmath7 in @xmath22 into two parts @xmath23 and @xmath24 by using an @xmath25-dimensional hyperplane @xmath26 such that the section @xmath27 cut out by @xmath26 is an @xmath25-dimensional simple convex polytope with certain property .",
    "of course , @xmath27 naturally inherits a coloring from @xmath7 .",
    "then by using automorphisms of @xmath27 and automorphisms of @xmath2 we can construct new colored polytopes @xmath28 from @xmath13 ( note that generally @xmath29 may not be combinatorially equivalent to @xmath5 ) , and further obtain new small covers @xmath30 from those new colored polytopes @xmath28 by the reconstruction of small covers .",
    "moreover , we can study how to construct the homeomorphisms between @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we give the method of constructing the homeomorphisms between @xmath9 and @xmath30 ( see theorems  [ extend]-[t : general ] ) .",
    ".2 cm    as an application , up to homeomorphism we shall classify all small covers over prisms .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a 3-dimensional prism that is the product of @xmath31 $ ] and an @xmath32-gon where @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath33 , and let @xmath34 . using the sector method , we first study rectangular sectors and find seven rectangular sectors with a good twist @xmath35 in section  [ rectangular ] ( see definition  [ good twist ] for @xmath35 ) .",
    "we then use these seven rectangular sectors to define some operations on the coloring sequences of side - faces of colored polytopes @xmath36 in section  [ prism ] .",
    "furthermore , we show that all @xmath37 can be reduced to some canonical forms without changing the homeomorphism type of the small covers @xmath9 ( see propositions  [ c1]-[c3 ] and [ pnontri ] ) .",
    "in particular , we introduce two combinatorial invariants @xmath38 and @xmath39 in section  [ prism ] , and then show in section  [ cohomology ] that @xmath40 is actually a complete homeomorphism invariant of a class of small covers @xmath9 ( see corollary  [ complete invariant ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also introduce two algebraic invariants @xmath41 and @xmath42 in @xmath43 , which can become a complete homeomorphism invariant in most cases .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath44 are of interest because of the nature of colored polytopes . with the help of these invariants ,",
    "we can obtain the following cohomological rigidity theorem .",
    "[ rigidity ] two small covers @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath45 are homeomorphic if and only if their cohomologies @xmath46 and @xmath47 are isomorphic as rings .",
    "kamishima and masuda showed in @xcite that the cohomological rigidity holds for small covers over a cube .",
    "in addition , masuda in @xcite also gave a cohomological non - rigidity example of dimension 25 .",
    "a further question is what extent the cohomological rigidity can extend to small covers .",
    "in addition , we also determine the number of homeomorphism classes of all small covers in @xmath45 .",

    "the purpose of this section is to briefly review the theory of small covers . throughout the following assume that @xmath12 is a small cover over a simple convex @xmath3-polytope @xmath5 .",

    "let @xmath50 denote the set of all facets of @xmath5 .",
    "take a @xmath51-face @xmath52 of @xmath5 , an easy observation shows ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.3 ) ) that @xmath53 is still a @xmath51-dimensional small cover . in particular , for any @xmath54 , its isotropy subgroup @xmath55 is independent of the choice of @xmath56 , denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath57 is isomorphic to @xmath58 , and @xmath57 fixes @xmath59 in @xmath60 . in the case",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 is a facet and @xmath57 has rank @xmath63 , so that @xmath57 uniquely corresponds to a nonzero vector @xmath64 in @xmath2 . then there is a natural map ( called _ characteristic function _ ) @xmath65 by mapping each facet @xmath66 to its corresponding nonzero vector @xmath64 in @xmath67 with the property @xmath68 : whenever the intersection of some facets @xmath69 in @xmath70 is nonempty ,",

    "davis and januszkiewicz @xcite gave a reconstruction of @xmath4 by using the @xmath21-coloring @xmath6 and the product bundle @xmath81 over @xmath5 .",
    "geometrically this reconstruction is exactly done by gluing @xmath82 copies of @xmath5 along their boundaries via @xmath6 .",
    "thus this reconstruction can be written as follows : @xmath83 then we have    all small covers over @xmath5 are given by @xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath86 on @xmath72 defined by @xmath87 , and it is easy to see that such an action is free , and also induces an action of @xmath86 on @xmath84 by @xmath88 . following @xcite , two small covers @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath84 are said to be _ davis - januszkiewicz equivalent _ if there is a @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",
