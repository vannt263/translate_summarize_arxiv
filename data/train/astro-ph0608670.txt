    "the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays extends over more than @xmath0 decades in energy .",

    "the highest energy cosmic rays ( which means particles with energies above @xmath1  eev @xmath2  ev ) must be produced by the most extreme non - thermal process in the universe .",
    "their energy spectrum , arrival directions , and composition can be inferred from air shower observations . however , the origin of these particles is still unknown and there is not a consensus whether there is a steepening in the energy spectrum at around @xmath3  eev . determining the shape of the spectrum in this energy range in sufficient detail requires an enormous detector exposure .",
    "the pierre auger observatory was designed to study these ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "although under construction , the auger southern site is the largest cosmic ray detector in the world .",
    "a fundamental characteristics of the pierre auger observatory is its capability of _ hybrid _ reconstruction of cosmic ray showers  @xcite .",
    "two independent detectors , the surface detector ( sd ) , which samples the shower particles at ground , and the fluorescence detector ( fd ) , which collects the fluorescence light emitted by the shower particles along their path in the atmosphere , are able to measure the energy and direction of the same cosmic ray shower . the enhanced capabilities of the auger hybrid detector are examined in this paper .",
    "the pierre auger observatory was designed to observe , in coincidence , the shower particles at ground and the associated fluorescence light generated in the atmosphere .",
    "this is achieved with a large array of water cherenkov detectors coupled with air - fluorescence detectors that overlook the surface array .",
    "it is not simply a dual experiment .",
    "apart from important cross - checks and measurement redundancy , the two techniques see air showers in complementary ways .",
    "a single air shower is detected 3-dimensionally .",
    "the ground array measures the 2-dimensional lateral structure of the shower at ground level , with some ability to separate the electromagnetic and muon components .",
    "the fluorescence detector records the longitudinal profile of the shower during its development through the atmosphere .",
    "a _ hybrid _ event is an air shower that is simultaneously detected by the fluorescence detector and the ground array .",
    "the observatory was originally designed and is currently being built with a _",
    "cross  triggering _ capability .",
    "data are recovered from both detectors whenever either system is triggered . if an air shower independently triggers both detectors the event is tagged accordingly .",
    "there are also cases where the fluorescence detector , having a lower energy threshold , promotes a sub  threshold array trigger .",
    "surface stations are then matched by timing and location .",
    "this is an important capability because these sub  threshold hybrid events would not have triggered the array otherwise .",
    "the geometrical reconstruction of the air shower s axis is accomplished by minimizing a @xmath4 function involving data from all triggered elements in the eye and on the ground .",
    "the reconstruction accuracy is far better than the ground array counters and the single eye could achieve independently  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the air fluorescence measurement and the particle detection on the ground provides an absolute energy calibration .",
    "the fd measurements determine the longitudinal development profile , whose integral is proportional to the total energy of the electromagnetic particle cascade .",
    "the sd independently estimates the shower energy by evaluating the particle density at @xmath5  m from the core .",
    "this ground parameter , called @xmath6 , is estimated from the surface stations by fitting the measured densities to a lateral distribution function  @xcite .",
    "a conversion factor that relates @xmath6 to the shower energy ( based on the fd information ) is extracted from hybrid events .",
    "this reduces significantly the dependence on air shower models and on assumptions of the primary composition .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration started the construction of the southern site in @xmath7 in the city of malarge , which is located at an elevation of @xmath8  m a.s.l . in the province of mendoza , argentina .",
    "after a successful operation of a prototype experiment  @xcite , the southern observatory started operation in _ hybrid _ production mode in january , 2004 .",
    "surface stations have a @xmath9% duty cycle , while fluorescence eyes can only operate on clear moonless nights .",
    "both surface and fluorescence detectors have been running simultaneously @xmath10 of the time .",
    "the number of hybrid events represents @xmath11 the statistics of the surface array data .",
    "the southern site will be completed in 2007 .",
    "another important objective is to obtain a uniform exposure over the full sky .",
    "this will be achieved by constructing a second instrument in the northern hemisphere .",
    "each site is conceived to cover an area of @xmath12  km@xmath13 in order to collect about @xmath14 event per week and site above @xmath3  eev .",
    "the northern observatory is planned to be sited in the u.s .",
    "a hybrid detector achieves the best geometrical accuracy by using timing information from all the detector components , both fd pixels and sd counters .",
    "each element records a pulse of light from which one can determine the central time of the pulse and its uncertainty .",
    "each trial geometry for the shower axis yields a prediction for the times at each detector component .",
    "differences between actual and predicted times are weighted using their corresponding uncertainties , squared , and summed to construct a @xmath4 value .",
    "the hypothesis with the minimum value of @xmath4 is the reconstructed shower axis .        in the fd ,",
    "cosmic ray showers are detected as a sequence of triggered pixels in the camera .",
    "an example of an event propagating through two adjacent fd telescopes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gcamera ] .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the determination of the shower - detector plane ( sdp ) .",
    "the sdp is the plane that includes the location of the eye and the line of the shower axis .",

    "this uncertainty in the sdp is not greater than about @xmath15 .",
    "next , the timing information of the pixels is used for reconstructing the shower axis within the sdp . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , the shower axis can be characterized by two parameters : the perpendicular distance @xmath16 from the eye to the track , and the angle @xmath17 that the track makes with the horizontal line in the sdp .",
    "each pixel which observes the track has a pointing direction which makes an angle @xmath18 with the horizontal line .",

    "such a monocular reconstruction may achieve excellent accuracy .",
    "however , the accuracy of the monocular reconstruction is limited when the measured angular speed @xmath22 does not change much over the observed track length .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timefit ] . for these events ( usually short tracks )",
    "there is a small curvature in the functional form of eq .",

    "[ fig : correlation ] .",
    "not only the uncertainties in @xmath24 and @xmath17 are large , but also they are strongly correlated .",
    "this translates directly into an uncertainty in the other shower parameters , especially in the reconstructed shower energy .",
    "this asymmetric uncertainty in the energy and angular resolution are important drawbacks of the monocular reconstruction .",
    "the aforementioned degeneracy can be broken by combining the timing information from the sd stations with that of the fd telescopes .",

    "this is an important capability because these sub  threshold hybrid events would not have triggered the array otherwise .",
    "in fact , the time of arrival at a single counter at ground can suffice for the hybrid reconstruction .",
    "the reconstruction uncertainties are evaluated using events with _ known _ geometries , _ i.e. _ laser beams .",
    "since the location of the clf ( approximately equidistant from the first three fluorescence sites ) and the direction of the laser beam are known to an accuracy better than the expected angular resolution of the fluorescence detector , laser shots from the clf can be used to measure the accuracy of the geometrical reconstruction .",
    "furthermore , the laser beam is split and part of the laser light is sent through an optical fiber to a nearby ground array station .",

    "the fd provides a nearly calorimetric , model - independent energy measurement : fluorescence light is produced in proportion to energy dissipation by a shower in the atmosphere .",
    "hybrid data establish the relation of shower energy to a ground parameter .",

    "these events have a better angular resolution ( @xmath46 at 68% c.l . in the eev energy range ) .",
    "considering the hybrid events with an energy between @xmath47  ev and @xmath48  ev , no significant excess is seen in the gc direction .",
    "for instance , in an optimal top - hat window of @xmath49 radius , 0.3 events are expected while no single event direction falls within that circle .",

    "of @xmath50 ( the factor @xmath51 is close to unity and parametrises the uncertainties in the flux normalization . )",
    "note that the energy assignments of the fd apply regardless of the assumed primary composition ( except for a small correction to account for the missing energy ) , be they protons or heavy nuclei .",
    "however , the acceptance has a dependence on composition because different primaries develop at different depths in the atmosphere . since a quality requirement for hybrid events is to have the maximum of the shower development inside the field of view of the telescopes , this affects the sensitivity to different primaries .",
    "the bound obtained is indeed conservative even if the bulk of the cosmic rays are heavy nuclei .",
    "an upper limit for the photon fraction in cosmic rays with energies above @xmath52  ev was derived using the hybrid data set  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the photon fraction lies in the fact that _ top - down _ models predict a considerable proportion of photons among the generated particles .",

    "@xcite to distinguish between hadrons and photons in the hybrid data exploits the information on the longitudinal profile of the air shower .",
    "in fact , this is the first such limit on photons obtained by observing the fluorescence light profile of air showers .",
    "the atmospheric depth at the shower maximum , @xmath53 , is commonly used as a discriminant observable for the cosmic ray composition because lighter nuclei penetrate , on average , more deeply into the atmosphere . above @xmath52  ev ,",

    "this results confirms and improves the existing limits above @xmath1  eev .",
    "this analysis is currently limited mainly by the the small number of events .",
    "the number of hybrid events will considerably increase in the next few years , and much lower primary photon fractions can be tested .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath56 could be achieved , for example , with two more years of data taking . moreover",
    ", the larger statistics will allow to increase the threshold energy above @xmath1  eev where even larger photon fractions are predicted by the models . a similar limit ( @xmath57 ) but at higher energy ( e.g. above @xmath58  eev ) , would be well below existing limits and severely constrain non - acceleration models .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is a hybrid detector with excellent capabilities for studying the highest energy cosmic rays .",
