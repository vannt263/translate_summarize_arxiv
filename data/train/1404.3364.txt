    "quantum states carry complete information of a physical system . to obtain the statistical properties of the system , one needs to know its state vector or density operator when it is in a pure or mixed state , respectively  @xcite .",
    "quantum state tomography ( qst ) is a procedure for reconstructing the state of quantum systems by measuring a complete set of observables  @xcite . in the past two decades",
    ", many advances have been made in qst for both continuous - variable  @xcite and discrete - variable  @xcite states .",
    "for example , the qst of a harmonic oscillator has been analyzed in both quadrature and fock - state representations . moreover ,",
    "quantum state reconstruction has also been studied on optical  @xcite and microwave  @xcite photon fields , as well as the motional states of matter systems , such as atoms  @xcite , molecules  @xcite , and micro- or nanomechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "generally , it is a difficult task to directly reconstruct the quantum state of a massive mechanical resonator because one can not access the mechanical excitation directly . usually , other auxiliary systems , such as optical modes  @xcite or atoms  @xcite are needed to transduce the states of mechanical modes . in this sense",
    ", optomechanical systems  @xcite can provide a natural platform to perform this task because there is an inherent interface between mechanical and optical modes . even though people have noticed the means for controlling mechanical motion ( e.g.",
    ", cooling  @xcite and quantum - state engineering  @xcite ) by designing proper driving fields , the method for monitoring the mechanical motion in the nonlinear quantum optomechanics via the optical means remains mostly unexplored .",
    "we note that qst in optomechanics has recently been studied in the short - pulse case  @xcite and in optically - levitating - dielectrics systems  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a reliable method for reconstructing the mechanical motional state of the moving mirror in cavity optomechanics .",
    "our approach is based on spectrometric measurement of the emission or scattering of a single photon interacting with the mechanical motion .",
    "owing to the optomechanical coupling , the mechanical oscillation will modulate the behavior of the single photon ( which will show in its spectrum ) , and hence one can infer the state information of the mechanical mode from the measured spectral data .",
    "we start by considering an open optomechanical cavity , which is formed by a fixed end mirror and a moving end mirror , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . assuming that the moving mirror is perfect and",
    "the fixed mirror is partially transparent , then the cavity fields couple with the continuous fields outside the cavity through photon - hopping interactions . in a rotating frame with respect to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) ,",

    "@xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the optical and mechanical modes , with respective frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the second term in @xmath10 describes the radiation - pressure coupling , and @xmath11 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling strength  @xcite .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the @xmath14th mode of the outside fields with resonant frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the detuning between the frequencies of the @xmath14th mode and the cavity mode .",
    "the coupling between the cavity field and the outside fields is described by the photon - hopping interaction with coupling strength @xmath17 . under the framework of the wigner - weisskopf theory ,",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is related to the photon decay rate by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the strength at the cavity resonance frequency .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian of the total system in the schrdinger picture can be written as @xmath20 because of @xmath21=0 $ ] .    because the mechanical decay rate @xmath22 is much smaller than the optical decay rate @xmath23 ( @xmath24 to @xmath25 in typical optomechanical systems  @xcite ) , in this paper we will merely take the photon decay into account and neglect the mechanical dissipation .",
    "this treatment is justified because the photon emission and scattering processes are completed in a time scale @xmath26 during which the mechanical dissipation is negligible .",

    "these two cases correspond to the single - photon emission and scattering processes .",
    "below , we derive the single - photon emission and scattering spectra when the mechanical resonator is in an arbitrary initial state .",
    "this is achieved by first calculating the spectra corresponding to the mirror initially in a fock state @xmath45 , and then we obtain the spectra for a general initial state by superposition . when the mirror is initially in the number state @xmath45 , the initial state of the total system is @xmath46 in the single - photon emission case , the single photon is initially in the cavity , and we have @xmath47 . in the scattering case ,",
    "the cavity is initially in a vacuum and the single photon is in a lorentzian wave packet in the continuous fields .",
    "then the initial state of the photon is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the wave - packet center and width , respectively . at time @xmath51 , the state of the system can be expressed as eq .",

    "@xcite . in the single - photon emission and scattering cases",
    ", we can check that the state of the system is normalized , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "since we treat the optomechanical system and the continuous fields outside the cavity as a whole closed system , the evolution of the total system is unitary .",
    "we should point out that , in the derivation of the analytical expression of these probability amplitudes , we have made the wigner - weisskopf approximation .",
    "based on the above discussions , we denote the relation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the unitary evolution operator associated with the hamiltonian @xmath63 of the total system .",

    "this result motivates us to reconstruct the initial state of the mirror by measuring the spectra of the outgoing photon .",
    "to better see this procedure , we first consider the diagonal density - matrix case , where the density matrix is diagonal in the basis of number states . in this case , the initial state of the mirror is assumed to be @xmath73 , with the phonon number distribution @xmath74 .",
    "then , the single - photon spectra become @xmath75 , where @xmath76 are the spectra corresponding to the component of the fock state @xmath77 . once we know the three parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath9 , then @xmath78 can be obtained . in realistic reconstructions ,",
    "we approximately truncate the hilbert space of the mirror into the lowest @xmath79-dimensional subspace . here",
    "the dimension parameter @xmath79 should be chosen to be sufficiently large such that the probabilities outside this subspace are negligible . in this case , the spectra can be approximated by @xmath80 inspired by this relation , we construct a system of linear equations for the variables @xmath74 by choosing @xmath79 sample points ( with the coordinates @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) from the spectra . the compact form of these equations is @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "one crucial factor in our method is to keep the validity of the truncation approximation in eq .",
    "( [ mixedconn ] ) , namely , we need to choose a proper truncation dimension @xmath79 .",
    "a natural question arises : for a unknown initial state of the mirror , how to choose a proper @xmath79 ? in a realistic simulation , we need to choose tentative values of @xmath79 many times by increasing @xmath79 step - by - step . for an insufficiently large @xmath79 ,",
    "the reconstructed elements are incorrect , and hence do not converge .",
    "we keep on increasing @xmath79 step - by - step , until the reconstructed data converges .",
    "then this value of @xmath79 will be good enough to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ mixedconn ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath79 used is larger than the dimension of the exact space , namely the number of nonzero probabilities , then the additional phonon probabilities will be zero in the solution . in this case",

    "[ fig2](b ) , the reconstructed distributions become stable as long as @xmath100 . for this state , when @xmath100 , the relation  ( [ mixedconn ] ) is exact because the hilbert space is truncated automatically .",
    "equation  ( [ mixedconn ] ) indicates that , once the dimension parameter @xmath79 is large enough to satisfy the truncation approximation , the reconstructed distributions should be independent of the choice of the sample points .",

    "a too - weak optomechanical - coupling can not capture the information regarding the phonon distribution from the spectra , and can not make sure @xmath108 becomes full rank . on the contrary , a large @xmath11 will increase the computational difficulties because the involved hilbert space for phonons is large .",
    "in addition , for the cavity - field decay rate @xmath23 , there is a wide range to choose .",

    "hence , the states of the mechanical motions are completely obtained by measuring the spectrum of the single photon , without post - selection .    to conclude",
    ", we have proposed a spectrometric approach for reconstructing the mechanical motional state in optomechanics by detecting single - photon spectra .",
    "we considered two different situations : single - photon emission and scattering , which correspond to the cases where the single photon is initially in the cavity field or in a wave packet in the continuous fields outside the cavity . in our considerations ,",
    "the mechanical dissipation was safely neglected , because the mechanical dissipation is negligible during the time interval for the single - photon emission and scattering to be finished .",
    "however , our studies included the photon dissipation by modeling the optical environment as a harmonic - oscillator bath , under the framework of the wigner - weisskopf approximation .",
    "our method has a mild constraint in the cavity - field decay rate : it works well in both the sideband - resolved and unresolved regimes .",
    "however , the single - photon coupling strength @xmath11 should satisfy @xmath107 , such that the single - photon spectra can capture the phonon - state information . in the single - photon strong - coupling regime ,",
    "the non - gaussian effects are observable .",
    "much recent attention has been paid to explore the non - gaussian physics in this parameter regime .",

    "<S> we propose a spectrometric method to reconstruct the motional states of mechanical modes in optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by detecting the single - photon emission and scattering spectra of the optomechanical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> owing to an optomechanical coupling , the _ a priori _ phonon - state distributions contribute to the spectral magnitude , and hence we can infer information on the phonon states from the measured spectral data . when the single - photon optomechanical - coupling strength is moderately larger than the mechanical frequency , then our method works well for a wide range of cavity - field decay rates , irrespective of whether or not the system is in the resolved - sideband regime . </S>"
