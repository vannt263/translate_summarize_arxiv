    "the key components of this system are : a pair of stripline kickers ( k1 and k2 ) , located with @xmath3 phase advance in between them , for applying beam position and angle correction in the vertical phase space ; three stripline bpms for registering the beam orbit ( p1 , p2 and p3 ) ; and additional electronic components , such as fb circuits , fast amplifiers and data acquisition devices .",
    "the font5 system incorporates a digital feedback processor based on a state - of - the art field programmable gate array ( fpga ) @xcite .",
