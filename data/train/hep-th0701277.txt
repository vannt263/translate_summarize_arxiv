    "lin and maldacena @xcite , building on the work of @xcite , have found another very interesting class of dualities .",
    "this class relates @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theories ( the plane wave matrix model , and maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theories on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) to type iia string theory in various backgrounds .",
    "the metric , dilaton , and form fields in the supergravity solutions in question can be expressed in terms of a single function that is an axisymmetric solution of the laplace equation in three dimensions . the gravity solutions , therefore , are specified by axisymmetric electrostatics configurations .",
    "the field theories in question have many vacua , and lin and maldacena @xcite were able to determine the correspondence between the vacua and the supergravity solutions .",
    "these present interesting examples of the gauge / gravity correspondence as field theories living in different numbers of dimensions are dual to string theory in backgrounds that share similar features in the infrared region , such as throats with ns5- or d2-brane flux .",
    "the electrostatics configurations corresponding to the field theory vacua are given by different arrangements of charged conducting disks @xcite .",
    "for a general vacuum on the field theory side , and therefore a general disk configuration on the gravity side , solving the electrostatics problem is quite challenging , and explicit solutions are known in only some special cases .    one particular solution given by lin and maldacena @xcite corresponds to two infinitely large disks held at fixed separation .",
    "they gave an explicit form for the gravity solution and argued that it should be dual to little string theory on @xmath5 .",
    "the gravity dual was used in @xcite to argue that little string theory on @xmath5 has interesting features that differ from the theory in flat space .",
    "an explicit solution has also been given in the case of a single isolated disk , dual to a vacuum of the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "also , in the region very close to the tip of a disk , the problem becomes two dimensional , and it is possible to solve it by conformal mapping @xcite .",
    "more general explicit solutions , however , are not known .",
    "in general this has prevented this set of dualities from being used to study the @xmath2 symmetric field theories at strong coupling .",
    "it is interesting to consider what questions can be addressed from the information we do know on the gravity side .",
    "recently , lin @xcite has made some progress in applying this correspondence to instanton calculations in the plane wave matrix model and maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory on @xmath3 . in the case of the matrix model",
    ", this question had been studied directly in the field theory @xcite .",
    "lin gave explicit results for weak coupling from the supergravity side , and found precise agreement with the gauge theory analysis .",
    "it would certainly be desirable to be able to perform other gauge theory calculations using the dual gravity description .",
    "it is , therefore , quite interesting to obtain more general supergravity solutions that would allow this to be done .",
    "in this paper we will demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the generic electrostatics problem to a simple linear system that can be solved very simply using numerical methods .",
    "we will then use this technique to find some explicit results using lin s prescription for instanton calculations on the dual gravity side . for a simple example electrostatics configuration , dual to a vacuum of the plane wave matrix model",
    ", we will give an explicit expression for the superpotential at strong coupling , and also the leading correction to lin s result at weak coupling .",
    "in this section we will review the lin - maldacena formulation of supergravity solutions in terms of electrostatics problems , full details can be found in @xcite . then in subsections [ gen ] and [ gpwmm ] we will discuss the solution of these problems .    to find the supergravity duals to field theories with @xmath2 symmetry , lin and maldacena looked for similarly symmetric supergravity solutions .",
    "in particular , the bosonic part of this symmetry group is @xmath6 so the supergravity solutions should contain an @xmath7 and an @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , with this restriction all of the supergravity fields can be expressed in terms of a single function of the two remaining coordinates . for the supergravity equations to be satisfied , this function must be an axisymmetric solution to the laplace equation in three dimensions .",
    "the full supergravity solution in terms of this function , in the string frame , is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electrostatics potential , and dots and primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . to avoid conical singularities in , when the size of the @xmath7 or @xmath5 shrinks , requires that either @xmath9 is regular at @xmath12 ( @xmath5 shrinks ) or @xmath13 ( @xmath7 shrinks ) .",
    "different supergravity solutions can , therefore , be specified by inserting some conducting disks of various radii @xmath14 at positions @xmath15 .",
    "see figure [ cycles ] . inserting",
    "a disk will create separate two regions on the @xmath11-axis on which the @xmath5 shrinks and will therefore mean adding a non contractible 6-cycle , which will carry ns5-brane flux .",

    "two additional constraints on the electrostatics solution come from ensuring that all of the metric components are positive definite and that the transformation to these coordinates is well defined .",
    "positive definiteness requires that the electrostatics potential takes a definite asymptotic form , and the coordinate transformation requires that the charge density vanishes at the edge of each disk .",
    "we will now describe a method for solving the electrostatics problems for generic configurations .",

    "this theory is related to @xmath1 sym on @xmath17 by dimensionally reducing that theory on the hopf fibre of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the field content is similar to @xmath1 , however the theory on @xmath3 admits vacuum configurations with non - trivial @xmath19 , the scalar field resulting from the dimensional reduction .",
    "the vacua of this theory are parametrized by a set of integers where @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "general discussion of the relations among the vacua in the @xmath2 symmetric field theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "the set of electrostatics configurations in question are given by an arbitrary set of positively charged conducting disks .",
    "each disk will be associated with some d2 brane charge , so it is natural to think of the supergravity solutions as being dual to vacua of maximally supersymmetric yang - mills on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the integers in the vacuum configuration for @xmath19 are related to positions of the disks by @xmath21 , and the number of units of charge on the disk is related to the number of times that each integer appears by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the solutions to these electrostatics problems have been given in some specific cases @xcite .",
    "for example the limit that the disks are very large , or only the geometry near the tip of a disk is of interest , the problem becomes two dimensional and it is possible to treat it with conformal mapping @xcite . in the case that there is a single disk it is possible to find an exact solution @xcite . for two equally sized disks",
    "a formal solution can be found @xcite .",
    "we will show that the techniques of @xcite to solve the electrostatics problem for two identical disks can be extended to more arbitrary disk configurations .",
    "we will discuss how these more general solutions may be found using these techniques .",
    "consider the case of a collection of @xmath23 charged conducting disks in the case of maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory on @xmath3 .",
    "this problem is similar to the one for two disks considered in @xcite , however we will allow the disks here to sit at arbitrary positions , @xmath24 and have arbitrary sizes , @xmath14 .",
    "we can take the potential to be @xmath25 where the first two terms ensure the correct asymptotic conditions , and the third is an asymptotically vanishing contribution that comes from the charges on the disks .",
    "it takes the form @xmath26 each function @xmath27 will be shown to determine the charge density on the @xmath28 disk . to fix the form of these functions we impose the conducting boundary conditions on the disks . in particular ,",
    "if the disks are held at fixed potentials @xmath29 , then we will find a set of dual integral equations similar in form to those in @xcite .",

    "this consists of discretizing the interval and solving the resulting linear system .",
    "an additional set of constraints comes from ensuring that the charge densities vanish at the edges of the disks . this amounts to enforcing that @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath48 as the set of solutions to with @xmath49 , where if there are @xmath50 disks @xmath51 , and @xmath52 as the set with @xmath53 .",
    "the condition that the charge density vanishes at the edge of the disk is then that @xmath54 there will be a unique solution for @xmath55 if @xmath56 . the full solution @xmath42 is then @xmath57 with the potentials @xmath58 given by @xmath59 where @xmath60    we have therefore reduced the electrostatics problem to a very simple linear system . in the case that there are only two disks , the problem is very straightforward and solution has been used to understand the relationship between sym on @xmath3 and little string theory @xcite .",
    "another theory for which lin and maldacena found the corresponding electrostatics configurations is the plane wave matrix model @xcite .",
    "the plane wave matrix model can be found by a consistent truncation of @xmath1 sym on @xmath17 to the set of constant modes on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the vacua of matrix model are given by the scalars that come from the former @xmath1 gauge field taking values in a representation of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "lin and maldacena @xcite associated these vacua with configurations of charged conducting disks above an infinite conducting plane .",
    "the method of solution is very similar to the case above . for the sake of brevity",
    "we will give the final solution .",
    "we will write the potential as @xmath62 where the first two terms are the background field and the @xmath58 arise from the charged disks as @xmath63 the green function is @xmath64 and @xmath42 is a solution of the integral equation @xmath65 in which the kernel is given by @xmath66 , \\ ] ] and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . the differences between this solution and the one presented in section [ gen ] arise from the presence of the infinite conducting plane that , via the method of images , implies the presence of oppositely charged conducting disks below the image plane . however , the conditions on the charges on the disks , , still hold , so the requirement that the charge density vanishes at the edge of the disk is that @xmath47 . we may again consider solutions to in which @xmath49 , which we will call @xmath48 , and @xmath52 for which @xmath69 .",
    "the condition that the charge density vanishes at the edge of each disk is again , and @xmath42 will be given by .    as in the case of sym on @xmath3 ,",
    "the electrostatics problem has been reduced to a very simple linear system .",
    "we will now show how we can solve this system to study instantons at strong coupling on the field theory side using this method .",
    "recently , lin @xcite has considered tunnelling between vacua in the plane wave matrix model and in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills on @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible to study this on both the gauge theory and gravity sides . in the gauge theory case , this can be approached by directly studying the instanton solutions @xcite .",
    "lin @xcite has also shown that it is possible to introduce a superpotential that gives a bound for the instanton action according to @xmath70 lin @xcite further studied this on the gravity side .",
    "explicit answers were given in the case that the disks in the corresponding electrostatics problem were small and could be approximated by point charges .",
    "moreover , lin @xcite gave a prescription for how the instanton action could be expressed in terms of the electrostatics potential in more general cases , but was not able to give explicit expressions .",
    "for completeness , we will briefly review lin s prescription for finding the instanton action from the gravity side @xcite , and then we will demonstrate the use of the techniques developed above to calculate the instanton action for some non - trivial electrostatics configurations .      since lin and maldacena @xcite have found electrostatics configurations corresponding to @xmath2 symmetric field theory vacua , it is interesting to understand how instantons in the field theories can be described in the gravity picture .",
    "lin @xcite has studied this question by first considering vacua in the field theories for which the electrostatics configurations do not differ drastically .",
    "these instantons can be addressed by calculating the action for a euclidean d2-brane wrapping a non - contractible @xmath71 in the geometry .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , since the brane will be wrapping a cycle carrying some @xmath72 units of flux , it should have @xmath72 d0-branes ending on it , and therefore describe the creation of @xmath72 d0-branes in the throat , see figure [ pwfig ] .        using the mapping to an electrostatics configuration",

    "this expression , however , is proportional to the change in energy of the electrostatics configuration , @xmath75 . this led lin @xcite to identify the superpotential at strong coupling as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy of the electrostatics configuration .    in the case that the disks are small relative to their separation , which is at weak coupling in the gauge theory , the superpotential is given by the energy of a system of point charges . using the prescription",
