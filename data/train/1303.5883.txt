    "few- and many - body systems in the presence of strong interactions is an increasingly fruitful direction in physics due to several advances in the experimental realization of such systems within cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "one aspect of this pursuit concerns the so - called unitary regime in which the two - body scattering amplitude saturates the unitarity bound of basic quantum mechanics . for neutral and non - polar cold atomic gases interactions",
    "are very short - ranged and one can often use the universal limit where interactions are modelled by a zero - range potential which is then subsequently connected to the low - energy two - body scattering dynamics through the scattering length , @xmath0 . in this framework ,",
    "the unitary regime is simply characterized by a scattering length that is much larger than any other relevant scale in the system under study .",
    "the problem of characterizing a strongly interacting system at unitarity in turn lacks a natural scale for the interactions , and one expects universal behavior of structural and dynamical properties that should be applicable irrespective of the details of the short - distance physics , and thus have applicability in many different subfields .",
    "an important recent development was the derivation of a number of universal relations that describe the physics of unitary two - component fermi gases by shina tan @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a parameter dubbed the ( two - body ) contact , @xmath1 , emerges in expressions for both structural ( energy , adiabatic theorem , pressure , virial theorem @xcite ) and dynamical observables ( inelastic loss @xcite , radio - frequency spectroscopy @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a strong connection between the few - body quantities and many - body observables , a connection that has by now been experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "the relations are not particular to the unitary fermi gas but may also be applied to bosons @xcite as another recent experimental effort has confirmed @xcite .    another direction that has enjoyed access to the unitary regime is the study of universal three - body bound states and the famous efimov effect @xcite .",
    "the effect occurs close to the unitary point and implies that a sequence of three - body bound states occurs wherein two successive states always have the same fixed ratio of their binding energies .",
    "the effect was first observed in cold atomic gas experiments @xcite and has subsequently opened a new research direction dubbed efimov physics @xcite .",
    "an interesting recent finding is that the presence of the efimov effect implies an extension of the universal relations discussed above , and the introduction of a three - body contact parameter , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this parameter vanishes in the case of two - component fermi gases since the pauli principle suppresses three - body correlations at short distances @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study three - body bound efimov - like states for systems that contain two identical bosons and a third distinguishable particle .",
    "our goal is to address the contact parameters of such systems when the masses are different and for different strengths of the interaction parameters by computing the single - particle momentum distributions and studying its asymptotic behavior .",
    "we will consider only the universal regime , i.e. we approximate all two - body potentials by zero - range interactions . in comparison to the previous studies containing three identical bosons",
    ", we find that for different particles there are additional contributions to the asymptotic behavior of the momentum distributions .",
    "this suggests that such measurements are a useful probe to descriminate between effects of identical and non - identical three - body correlations in the many current cold gas experiments that have mixtures of different kinds of atoms in the same trap .",

    "@xcite , i.e. that the leading term has a @xmath173 tail while the subleading contribution is @xmath174 times a log - periodic oscillatory function that is characteristic of the efimov effect and that depends on the scale factor ( and thus on the mass ratio ) of the efimov states .",
    "in particular , we find that for general mass ratios , there is a non - oscillatory @xmath174 contribution which appears to only vanish ( and leave the oscillatory contribution behind ) when the mass ratio is 0.2 , 1 , or 1.57 .",
    "to examplify our study , we consider @xmath4cs-@xmath4cs-@xmath82li and @xmath5rb-@xmath5rb-@xmath82li where we numerically determine the coefficient of the @xmath173 tail which is the two - body contact parameter introduced by tan @xcite . for these examples",
    ", we also numerically determine the momentum distributions of excited efimov trimers for both the heavy and light components .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that the momentum distributions of ground , first , and second excited efimov trimers approach universal behavior very fast at large but also at small momentum , indicating that one does not need to go to highly excited ( and numerically challenging ) three - body states in order to study the universal behavior of efimov states in momentum space .",
    "recent experiments have succesfully measured the momentum distribution of ultracold atomic gases using time - of - flight and mapping to momentum space @xcite and bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "observing a constant @xmath175 contribution in a system with non - equal mass three - body states is a considerable challenge since one needs to first subtract the leading - order @xmath176 contribution .",
    "the @xmath176 tail can be extracted with good precision as discussed in the experimental papers @xcite .",
    "if we assume that this subtraction of leading order can be done without severe increase of uncertainties in the data , then one would need to look at small and intermediate @xmath177 values for this sub - leading tail behavior .",
    "a natural extension of the present work is to consider three - body states in dimensions lower than three . in two - dimensions",
    "it is well - known that no efimov effect occurs @xcite and , among other things , this implies that the momentum distribution does not have the subleading oscillatory behavior in two dimensions @xcite . for two - dimensional systems with large differences in the masses",
    "it is still possible to have many three - body bound states @xcite and this should also be reflected in some way through the asymptotic momentum distribution .",
    "another intriguing question is how the universal tail behavior and the contact relations behave in a crossover between two- and three - dimensional or one- and three - dimensional setups @xcite .",
    "while we have studied only short - range interactions in the current paper , it would be interesting to consider the momentum tails of few - body bound states in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "recent experiments with heteronuclear molecules have demonstrated that the momentum distribution in dipolar systems can be probed using absorption imaging @xcite .",
    "few - body bound states of dipolar particles have been predicted in a large parameter regime for both one- @xcite and two - dimensional systems @xcite . as was recently shown ,",
    "one - dimensional dipolar few - body systems can in some cases be described by using zero - range interaction terms with appropriately chosen effective interactions parameters @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of using the same formalism with short - range interactions as discussed in the current paper but applied in a one - dimensional setup .",
    "it should then be possible to derive the contact parameters in the presence of few - body bound states with dipolar particles in one dimension , similarly to what has been done for non - dipolar bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite .",

    "<S> to exemplify our results , we consider mixtures of lithium with either two caesium or rubium atoms which are systems of current experimental interest . </S>"
