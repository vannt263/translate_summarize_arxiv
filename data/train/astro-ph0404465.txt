    "the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of galaxies has been suspected for almost half a decade , as accretion onto smbhs seemed the only logical explanation for the existence of quasars .",
    "hst observations have provided evidence that smbhs with masses ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6  are present in the centre of a few dozens of nearby ( quiescent ) galaxies .",
    "be this sufficient evidence for the existence of smbhs , we can now tackle more fundamental questions concerning their formation and evolution .",
    "an obvious way to proceed is the study of the relation between smbhs and the galaxies that host them .",
    "it was found that black hole masses are correlated with parameters of the hot stellar components of their host galaxies . the tight @xmath3@xmath1  relation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) is now the preferred paradigm to study smbh demographics in galactic nuclei .",
    "this apparently tight link between bulges and smbhs reflects an important ingredient that should be reproduced ( and thus hopefully explained ) by theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "in fact , the tightness of the @xmath3@xmath1  correlation is somewhat surprising . in most of the state - of - the - art models ,",
    "the total galaxy mass ( or dark matter mass @xmath7 ) , rather than the bulge mass , plays a fundamental role in shaping the smbhs .",
    "a close correlation could therefore be expected between @xmath3 and @xmath7 , rather than between @xmath3 and the bulge properties . establishing whether the @xmath3@xmath1  or the @xmath3@xmath7relation reflects the fundamental mode by which smbhs form and evolve will ultimately rely on a comparison of the intrinsic scatter of the two correlations .",
    "unfortunately , a direct observational characterization of the @xmath3@xmath7relation is currently impossible .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2002b ) first argued that a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath7 should be reflected in an @xmath3@xmath0  correlation , where @xmath0 is the circular velocity in the flat part of the rotation curve of spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , in most of the state - of - the - art galaxy formation models , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the circular velocity and the mass of the dark matter halo .",
    "unfortunately , there are ( presently ) only a handful of spiral galaxies with secure smbh masses , and only two of them have a well - measured extended rotation curve .",
    "a way to avoid this problem is to adopt the tight @xmath3@xmath1  correlation in order to estimate black hole masses in a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "a tight correlation between smbh mass and dark matter halo mass should thus appear in the form of a correlation between central velocity dispersion and circular velocity .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2002b ) presented a first attempt at establishing such a correlation .",
    "baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) significantly improved on these results by almost doubling the sample size .",
    "the present contribution is focused on the latter results .",
    "a simple measure for the circular velocity of galaxies is half of the integrated line width from spatially unresolved hi 21 cm measurements , corrected for inclination .",
    "various authors have recovered a nearly linear correlation between integrated line width and bulge velocity dispersion ( e.g.  whitmore & kirshner  1981 ; whittle  1992 ; franx  1993 ) .",
    "this correlation has significant scatter and galaxy type could act as a third parameter in this correlation .",
    "this can be due to the fact that the integrated line width is not an accurate measure for the flat part of the rotation curve , and hence of the total dark matter content .",
    "therefore , we chose to consider only those galaxies with an extended rotation curve measured well beyond the optical radius , in order to reliably trace the circular velocity in the flat part of the rotation curve . in order to see the benefits of this approach ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the tully - fisher ( tf ) study of the ursa major cluster spiral galaxies by verheijen  ( 2001 ) : the scatter in the tf relation strongly decreases when he considers the flat part in the rotation curve instead of the integrated line width .",
    "we constructed a data set of 28 spiral galaxies with central velocity dispersion data and a rotation curve measured beyond the optical radius . for 16 spirals ,",
    "the data could be retrieved from the literature ( see references in ferrarese  2002b ) . for the remaining 12 galaxies ,",
    "rotation curve data were available in the literature ( palunas & williams 2000 ) , and the velocity dispersions were measured with the efosc2 instrument on the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the total sample of 28 spiral galaxies can be found in baes et al .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ vcsigma.eps ] we plot the circular velocity versus the velocity dispersion for the 28 spiral galaxies in our sample . for the 24 galaxies with a velocity dispersion greater than about 80",
    ", there is a very tight correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we fitted a straight line to these data , taking into account the errors on both quantities and obtained @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "two issues concerning this @xmath0@xmath1correlation deserve some special attention .",
    "firstly , the tightness of the correlation is astonishing : we find @xmath10 , corresponding to a goodness - of - fit of 99.9 per cent .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1  relation can hence be regarded as having a negligible intrinsic scatter .",
    "moreover , this correlation appears to be robust : there are no significant outliers in the range @xmath11 .",
    "the correlation appears to break down for galaxies with dispersions below about 80  however : all four galaxies with @xmath2 lie significantly above the correlation defined by the more massive spirals .",
    "interestingly , this is also the mass range in which nearly all bulgeless spiral galaxies are located .",
    "new observations are indispensable to understand the behaviour of the @xmath0@xmath1  correlation in the low mass regime .",
    "moreover , all galaxies in our sample are high surface brightness galaxies , and it presently unclear how the @xmath0@xmath1  relation behaves in diverse environments ( see also pizzella et al .",
    "2004 ) .    secondly , it is interesting to compare this correlation to a similar one recently found for elliptical galaxies .",
    "based on stellar dynamical models for 20 round ellipticals constructed by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , gerhard et al .  ( 2001 ) discovered a very tight relation between the central dispersion and the circular velocity ( the circular velocity curves of ellipticals were found to be flat to within 10 per cent ) .",
    "both the slope and zero - point of this correlation agree amazingly well with the @xmath0@xmath1  correlation of our spiral galaxy sample ( see right panel of figure  1 ) .",
    "gerhard et al .  ( 2001 ) argue that a proportionality between @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be expected for ellipticals on the basis of their dynamical homology . for spiral galaxies this proportionality",
    "can not be explained by simple dynamical arguments , as convincingly argued by ferrarese  ( 2002b ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that both spiral and elliptical galaxies seem to obey exactly the same correlation is absolutely striking .",
    "as both the @xmath0@xmath1  and @xmath3@xmath1  correlations seem to hold over the entire hubble range , we can combine them to derive a correlation between the circular velocity and smbh mass .",
    "although the slope of the @xmath3@xmath1  relation is not well established ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese  2002a ) , this little affects the conclusion that the @xmath0@xmath1  relation entails a connection between smbh mass and the large scale velocity of the host galaxy ( and henceforth the mass of the surrounding dark matter halo ) .",
    "for instance , using the characterization of the @xmath3@xmath1  relation from tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we obtain @xmath12 the correlation between smbh mass and circular velocity is useful for two different goals .",
    "firstly , combined with other tight relations such as the @xmath3@xmath1  relation and the tf relation , it clearly points at an intimate interplay between the various galactic components ( dark matter , discs , bulges and smbhs ) and forms a strong test for galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0@xmath1  relation can be used to discriminate between various theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , if smbhs form mainly through coalescence of smaller black holes during galaxy mergers , a relation @xmath13 is expected , whereas theories in which accretion and feedback are the main ingredients for black hole growth prefer a @xmath14 relation ( e.g.  silk & rees  1998 ; haiman & loeb  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; kauffman & haehnelt  2000 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "apart from being an ingredient in theoretical galaxy formation models , the derived @xmath3@xmath0  relation can also serve as a practical tool to estimate the black hole masses in spiral galaxies .",
    "the most preferred means of estimating @xmath3 in galaxies is the @xmath3@xmath1relation .",
    "unfortunately , the number of spiral galaxies with reliable velocity dispersion measurements is relatively small .",
    "since extended rotation curves have been measured for large samples of spiral galaxies ( mainly for use in tf studies ) , the @xmath3@xmath0  relation has the potential to become an important practical tool in estimating supermassive black hole masses in spiral galaxies ."
