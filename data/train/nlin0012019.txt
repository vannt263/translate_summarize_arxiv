    "the nature of the quantum eigenstates in billiards , which are classically chaotic , has been subject to much theoretical and experimental work .",
    "the seminal studies by mcdonald and kaufmann @xcite of the morphology of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) eigenstates in a closed bunimovich stadium have revealed characteristic complex patterns of disordered , undirectional and non - crossing nodal lines .",
    "the spatial behavior of the eigenstates of chaotic billiards is still of considerable theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "for recent theory see , e.g. , @xcite , the review by robnik @xcite , and references cited ; examples of measurements on electron billiards and wave - dynamical analogues are found in , e.g. , @xcite ( quantum corrals ) , @xcite ( microwave cavities ) , @xcite ( acoustic resonators ) , @xcite ( surface water waves in tanks ) and in @xcite in general .",
    "other well known signatures of quantum chaos in closed billiards are related to the distribution of nearest level separations and spectral rigidity .    for open billiards , i.e. , billiards with attached leads",
    ", the picture is less clear .",
    "one may use the poles of the scattering matrix which are related to the decay time from a billiard @xcite .",
    "when transport through a billiard takes place one may as an alternative focus on the fact that the wave function @xmath0 is scattering state with both real and imaginary parts .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to 2d systems , as we will do throughout this work , this means that there are two separate sets of nodal lines at which either @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] vanish .",
    "the intersections of the two sets at which @xmath1 = im[\\psi ] = 0 $ ] define the nodal points .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the shape of distribution function for the nearest distances between these nodal points ( dfndnp ) depends on whether the billiard is nominally either regular or irregular @xcite . for transmission through chaotic billiards",
    "the dfndnp appears to have a general characteristic form , while for regular billiards like , for example , rectangular ones there are specific features of the dfndnp that depend on the particular geometry , at least as long as only a few channels are open .",
    "thus , besides the vivid physical role played by the nodal points as centers of vortical motion @xcite , their statistical distribution may tell if chaos is present or not .",
    "the present work relates to quantum transport transport in open electron billiards .",
    "the issue of wave function singularities is , however , part a much broader context @xcite .",
    "an appealing argument that favors our view that dfndnp serves as a signature of quantum chaos is the coincidence with the corresponding distribution function for the berry state @xcite .",
    "according to berry s conjecture a chaotic state can be viewed as a superposition of a large number of interfering monochromatic de broglie waves@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent random variables and @xmath6 are randomly oriented wave vectors of equal length .",
    "the berry wave function may be regarded as a standard measure of quantum chaos .",
    "in fact , there are beautiful experimental observations of berry waves on the surface of water in an agitated ripple tank with stadium - shaped walls @xcite .    so far all our conclusions about dfndnp rest on numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the berry state is , however , available in a mathematical form that invites to analytic approaches . in the present work we will therefore model the dfndnp @xmath7 and its main asymptotic behavior analytically using the fundamental property that the berry function ( 1 ) is gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "we will also show that there are other types of distribution functions that are related to the chirality of the nodal points .",
    "each nodal point is a topological singularity of the wave function@xcite . as a result",
    "there is a vortex centered around each nodal point with definite chirality depending on whether the current flows clockwise or anti - clock wise as indicated in fig , [ fig1 ] .",
    "we therefore label each nodal point by @xmath8 . in analogy with @xmath7",
    "we therefore introduce the distribution functions @xmath9 for nearest neighbor separations between points with chiralities @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "analytic expressions for these distributions will be derived below and compared with numerical computations using the berry wave function . as will be pointed out in the text our results partly overlap with recent work by berry and dennis @xcite ( the pair correlation functions @xmath12 and the relation between the mean density and wave number @xmath13 ) .",
    "most recently dennis has also considered the distribution of nearest distances among nodal points using the poisson model@xcite .    in the following sections we will derive expressions for the distributions of nearest neighbor separations between points with chiralities @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for this purpose we will also have to consider the pair correlation functions @xmath12 .",
    "we will make use of two different analytic approaches based on the poisson and bernoulli models .",
    "in addition we will also calculate the distributions by direct numerical methods , i.e. , we locate the nodal points by simply computing the nodal lines for @xmath14 and @xmath15 and how they cross . in principle",
    "the numerical results represent the correct distributions and gives us a way to test the accuracy of the different analytic approaches .",
    "consider the berry function ( [ berry ] ) as the complex random function @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the 2d position with cartesian coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 are two real random fields .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 and @xmath20 are mutually statistically independent , homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random fields with zero mean .",
    "the correlation function has the well known form @xmath22 which is a direct consequence of the berry function ( [ berry ] ) . to find the statistical properties of the nodal points @xmath23 we have to consider the intersections of the zero level curves ( nodal lines ) of the fields @xmath21 and @xmath24 i.e. , the roots of the two equations : @xmath25 as mentioned in the introduction the nodal points are the centers of vortices .",

    "@xcite it is named topological charge .",
    "there are as many points with @xmath43 as with @xmath44 .",
    "next , let us define the mean density @xmath45 and the correlation function for the random density @xmath46    notice that because @xmath47 is a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random field , the mean density @xmath48 is constant and the correlation function @xmath49 depends only on the distance @xmath50 between the points of observation @xmath17 and @xmath51 . formulas ( [ density ] ) , ( [ 3.1 ] ) , ( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) form the basis of the statistical analysis of the nodal points distribution assuming that the functions @xmath21 and @xmath20 are random functions .",
    "the mean density defines a characteristic scale @xmath52 which we will use below as the natural unit of distances in the `` gas '' of randomly distributed points , i.e. , we will use the dimensionless variable @xmath53 moreover it is convenient to formulate some analytical results in terms of the dimensionless pair pair correlation function with dimensionless argument @xmath54    we now introduce the mean density @xmath55 around of a given point . one can show that @xmath56 which will play a crucial role in the following derivation of dfndnp for the berry function .    we now consider some useful relations for the statistics of the nodal points .",
    "firstly , consider the mean number of points inside a circle @xmath57 with radius @xmath58 centered at some given point .",
    "it is obvious that the mean number of points enclosed by the circle is equal to @xmath59 using the dimensionless coordinate ( [ 4.4 ] ) one obtains @xmath60 this relation takes into account that the dimensionless correlation function @xmath61 is at the same time the dimensionless mean density .",
    "secondly , consider also the relation for the mean number of nodal points @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the probability that @xmath64 neighboring points belong to the circle .",
    "these probabilities satisfy the normalization condition @xmath65    the probability @xmath66 is of great importance because it is directly related to the distribution function for nearest distances between a given point and its neighbouring points ( dfndnp ) @xmath67 .",
    "this is because the cumulative distribution of the nearest distances @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 therefore we may now write the following relation for the dimensionless distribution of nearest distances @xmath70 thus , the last formula reduces the problem of calculating the dfndnp to that of finding @xmath71 . below",
    "we will find approximate expressions for @xmath71 .",
    "however , we will first present asymptotic formulas for @xmath71 and the dfndnp . for small @xmath72",
    "one may replace the exact relations ( [ 4.7 ] ) , ( [ 4.8 ] ) with the asymptotic forms @xmath73 finally , from ( [ 4.7 ] ) , ( [ 4.10 ] ) and the last relation above one obtains the folowing asymptotic formula for the exact dfndnp @xmath74    let us now apply these general considerations to the berry function ( [ berry ] ) .",
    "first of all we will calculate the mean density @xmath48 ( [ 4.2 ] ) . using the definition ( [ density ] ) and the fact that the variables of the homogeneous gaussian field and its derivatives are statistically independent at the same point we have @xmath75 it is straightforward to show that @xmath76 where @xmath13 is modulus of wave vector of the berry function ( [ berry ] ) .",
    "therefore , substituting ( [ deltau ] ) into ( [ rho1 ] ) we obtain the final expression for the mean density @xmath77 this exact relation has been derived recently also by berry and dennis @xcite    secondly , consider the density correlation function ( [ 4.3 ] ) @xmath78 the calculation of @xmath49 is given in the appendix ( [ 61 ] ) . and",
    "the dimensionless pair correlation function for arbitrary @xmath72 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the general behavior reminds superficially of the correlation functions for amorphous solids with short range order and distinct shell - like structures present .",
    "the correlations are , however , more long - range in the present case .",
    "the same pair correlation function was recently obtained by berry and dennis @xcite , although expressed in a different analytic form .",
    "the derivations are somewhat tedious as indicated by the appendix .",
    "it is therefore rewarding that there is perfect numerical agreement with berry and dennis results@xcite .    using the expressions in the appendix we can find the asymptotic expression @xmath79 from which we obtain the asymptote for the dfndnp ( [ 25 ] ) at small @xmath72 @xmath80 this exact result is useful for testing approximate analytical solutions and numerical simulation data",
    "in order to model the dfndnp by analytic means we may in a first attempt use the poisson approximation . this approach has been discussed recently also by dennis@xcite .",
    "the poisson approximation implies that all points around a given one ( which is located in center ) are statistically independent , i.e. , it neglects higher order correlations .",
    "therefore we have to take into account correlations only between the given point and its neighbours .",
    "these correlations can be incorporated using the mean density of points @xmath81 around the given point ( [ 4.5 ] ) . according to the poisson law the probability that no other points belong to circle with dimensionless radius @xmath72 is @xmath82 using the relation ( [ 4.10 ] )",
    ", we easily obtain the formula for the dfndnp in the poissonian approximation @xmath83 one notes that for small @xmath72 the asymptote of the approximate dfndnp ( [ dfnd2 ] ) coincides with exact one ( [ asymdfnd ] ) .    for the special case of",
    "uniformly distributed and completely random points @xmath84 we immediately obtain the well known result @xcite @xmath85 for convenience we also introduce the new dimensionless radius @xmath86 which refers to mean distance between nearest nodal points @xmath87 .",
    "the main asymptotic for the dfndnp ( [ asymdfnd ] ) then reads @xmath88 a comparison between ( [ dfnd2 ] ) , ( [ eggert ] ) and the numerically calculated dfndnp are given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    obviously the simplest model with @xmath84 can not reproduce the true dfndnp for the simple reason that the nodal points are not random points .",
    "the poisson approximated function ( [ dfnd2 ] ) is obviously in much better agreement with the numerical results although the distribution falls off to quickly at large separations .",
    "the agreement for small @xmath89 is more satisfactory with @xmath90 which is rather close to the value @xmath91 obtained from the direct numerical calculations .",
    "although the poissonian modeling gives reasonable results we need to go beyond it for a better description of the intrinsic statistical , higher - order correlations among the nodal points as indicated by fig .",
    "a general disadvantage of the poissonian approach is that all nodal points are competing with each other to be neighbours of a given point .",
    "it is clear , however , that only nearest neighbours of the given point actually participate in such a competition .",
    "therefore we consider the bernoulli approximation for the nearest distances of points which takes into account the competition between neighbouring points .",
    "similar to the poisson approximation we again consider the circle @xmath92 of radius @xmath93 with the center at a given point @xmath94 and assume that all points except the given one are statistically independent .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the total number of points inside the circle @xmath92 is just equal to the mean density integral @xmath95 with these conditions the distribution of each randomly located point belonging to @xmath92 point is exactly equal to @xmath96 next , let us consider another circle @xmath97 with the center at the same origin @xmath98 and radius @xmath99 .",
    "obviously the probability to find a point in this smaller circle is equal to @xmath100 where @xmath101 in the same way we have that the probability that a point does not fall into the circle @xmath102 is equal to @xmath103 since points are statistically independent the probability for all points to be outside the circle @xmath104 equals @xmath105 from eqns .",
    "( [ 4.9 ] ) , ( [ 4.10 ] ) , and ( [ 35 ] ) it follows directly that @xmath106 to obtain the dfndnp analytically we make the following approaches within the bernoulli approximation .",
    "( i ) in formula ( [ 41 ] ) we replace the number of points @xmath107 by the mean number of points @xmath108 ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "( ii ) we choose the radius @xmath93 in such a way that inside the circle @xmath109 there are a certain number of points which compete with each other to be the nearest neighbour to @xmath94 .",
    "the minimum number of points in the circle is obviously three if we also include the central point . in the following",
    "we will simply use this value . as a result",
    "we obtain , instead of formula ( [ 60 ] ) , the following expression @xmath110 it is easy to verify that this approximate distribution is normalized and has the same asymptote as the exact distribution function ( [ asymdfnd ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the analytic results in ( [ 42 ] ) are compared with the numerical distribution obtained directly from the berry function .",
    "the bernoulli approach is evidently more powerful than our previous attempt in predicting the dfndnp ( [ dfnd2 ] )",
    ". the reason would be that we now catch some of the higher - order correlations .",
    "the distribution ( [ 42 ] ) has the same linear behaviour at small @xmath72 as in previous expressions ( [ asymdfnd ] ) and ( [ asymdfndz ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath111 which is quite close to numerics ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "to gain more detailed statistics of nodal points we consider statistical characteristics of chiral dependent nodal points density similar to ( [ 3.1 ] ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 numerates positions of vortices with chirality @xmath114",
    ". formulas ( [ 3.0 ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) can be written via the chiral densities ( [ rsigma ] ) @xmath115 similar to ( [ 4.2 ] ) we introduce the chiral mean densities @xmath116 the last equality follows from the mean spacial isotropy of the berry function ( [ berry ] ) which implies that in mean there is no preferred chirality of nodal points .",
    "moreover we introduce the chiral the auxilliary correlation function @xmath117 @xmath118 and correlation functions of the chiral mean densities ( [ rsigma ] ) @xmath119 @xmath120 from relations ( [ 3.0 ] ) , ( [ 3.1 ] ) , ( [ 4.3 ] ) , ( [ gv ] ) and ( [ gsigma ] ) it follows that @xmath121.\\ ] ]    consider a nodal point with chirality @xmath10 .",
    "similar to ( [ 4.5 ] ) we define the mean chiral densities around this point ( [ rhosigma ] ) @xmath122 then from ( [ gtogsigma ] ) and ( [ gammasigma ] ) we obtain @xmath123.\\ ] ] the subscripts @xmath124 in ( [ gammachir ] ) indicate that the given point and its neighbours have the same vorticity , while @xmath125 refers to different chiralities for the given point and its neighbours .",
    "therefore a knowledge of the correlation functions @xmath49 and @xmath126 which are calculated in appendix ( formulas ( [ 56 ] ) and ( [ 75 ] ) ) is enough to find the chiral mean densities and correlation functions .",
    "these chirality - dependent correlation functions are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in the scaled form @xmath127    also in this case we find good agreement with berry and dennis @xcite .",
    "above we alluded to the general shape of pair - correlation functions for amorphous materials . with",
    "the dependence on @xmath10 included we may obviously carry this naive picture a bit further to talk in a loose way about the nodal points as a two - component system in which objects with the same vorticities ( topological charges ) repel each other . at the same time",
    "objects with the same @xmath10 may approach each other closely .",
    "hence we may think about the system of nodal points as a thin slab of a fictitious binary amorphous solid or salt .",
    "of course , this analogy should not be pushed too far .    in order to find the distributions functions @xmath128 for nearest distances between nodal points with chiralities @xmath10 and @xmath11 we insert @xmath129 into ( [ dfnd2 ] ) .",
    "for the bernoulli approximation one also has to label the mean number of points ( [ 38 ] ) as @xmath130 which is to be be inserted in ( [ 41 ] ) .",
    "we have found above , however , that already the poisson approximation catches the gross features of the nearest neighbor distribution .",
    "for this reason and because the bernoulli approximation is overly tedious we will restrict ourselves to the poisson approximation at this stage .",
    "thus we consider    @xmath131    using ( [ gammachir ] ) , ( [ nsigma ] ) and ( [ fsigma ] ) one can show that the asymptote of @xmath132 coincides with the asymptote for the dfndnp ( [ asymdfnd ] ) . for @xmath133 , however , we obtain the quite different form @xmath134    the @xmath10-dependent dfndnp ( [ fsigma ] ) for @xmath135 and @xmath136 are compared with numerical results in figs [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] . the difference between the two combinations @xmath135 and",
    "@xmath136 is very clear . in the first case",
    "there is a strong repulsion between the nearest neighbors , a result that is to be expected from fig .",
    "the distribution is , however , of a very simple form .",
    "essentially is corresponds a symmetric ring ( first shell ) around the given point . except for the low tail regions it is well approximated by a gaussian , i.e.",
    ", there is basically a random distribution within the shell.    in the second case , ( @xmath137 ) , the distribution shows how the nodal points are allowed to come arbitrary close to each other and how the shell structure is less pronounced . for small separations",
    "@xmath138 is obviously the dominant term in the total distribution @xmath139 .",
    "finally we note that @xmath140 for opposite chiralities ( topological charges ) and @xmath141 for equal chiralities , i.e. , there are inner and outer shells for opposite and equal vorticities , respectively .",
    "as shown by figs [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] the poisson approximation reproduces the numerical results in at least a qualitatively correct way .",
    "we have considered the distribution among nodal points associated with chaotic wave dynamics .",
    "the nodal points are of special interest as they are associated with vortical flow and chirality @xmath10 which is either @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",
    "in particular we have focused on the distribution of nearest separations among the nodal points .",
    "the reason is that distributions of this kind may carry information about chaotic dynamics as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "we have introduced analytic approaches based on complex gaussian random functions with the known correlation function @xmath144 .",
    "two cases have been considered , namely the poisson and bernoulli approximations .    as a supplement to the analytic approaches we have performed numerical calculations to locate the nodal points and their vorticity using the berry chaotic wave function in eq .",
    "( [ berry ] ) .",
    "the numerical distributions computed in this way are in principle the correct ones and are therefore useful for testing the accuracy of the analytic modeling .",
    "we thus find that already the poisson approximation gives a good qualitative understanding of the distribution of nearest neighbor separations .",
    "some higher order correlations are , however , not accounted for .",
    "for this reason we have also considered the bernoulli approximation which picks up some of these features . on the other hand the behaviour at large distances needs further work .",
    "when the distribution of nearest neighbor distances is separated into distances between nodal points with equal and opposite chiralities one obtains a picture that superficially reminds of binary amorphous matter .",
    "there are distinct inner and outer shells associated with opposite and equal chiralities , respectively .",
    "while points with opposite chiralities may get close to each other there is a strong repulsion among pairs with equal chirality .",
    "the reason is , loosely speaking , that nodal points with equal chirality have to appear in conjunction with anti - vortices or saddle points .",
    "these anti - vortices act as local beam splitters and are necessary for two nearby vortices to spin the same way .",
    "these interesting features should be pursued further because the distributions among the different phase singularities are obviously interrelated .",
    "effectively we may then arrive at a description reminding of a ternary amorpous materials .",
    "the distributions discussed here relate to generic features of a wave - chaotic state . for this reason it would be of interest if they could be verified experimentally . using ,",
    "e.g. , micro - wave cavities this appears to be a real possibility @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the swedish institute ( a.i.s . ) , the royal swedish academy of sciences ( a.f.s . ) , the krasnoyarsk science foundation ( a.f.s . , grant 9f82 ) , and the swedish natural science research council .",
