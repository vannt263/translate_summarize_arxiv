    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) probes collisions of protons at very high energies , resulting in a multitude of final - state particles . with increasing energy , the probability that one hadron - hadron collision leads to more than one scattering process also increases .",
    "these additional scattering processes beside the primary hard scattering belong to the group of multi - parton interactions ( mpi ) .",
    "their estimation is important for the correct determination of background from standard model processes , for instance when the signal process consists of new physics particles .",
    "in particular , double parton scattering ( dps ) , where two distinct parton interactions arise from the same proton - proton collision , can become likely enough to compete with single parton scattering ( sps ) processes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dpsfeyn ] .",
    "therefore , a thorough understanding of these additional contributions is needed for a precise theoretical description of the background at the lhc and will also help to explore the inner structure of protons and nucleons , not being accessible by perturbative calculations .",
    "double parton scattering has been searched for both in pre - lhc experiments like afs , ua2 , cdf , and d0 as well as by the lhcb and atlas collaborations , in 4-jet @xcite , @xmath6-jet @xcite , di-@xmath7-jets @xcite , @xmath8-jets @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , open charm @xcite , @xmath0+charm @xcite , @xmath11+charm @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite final states . on the theoretical side",
    "the efforts have concentrated on improving the understanding of the underlying scattering mechanism as well as providing phenomenological predictions . in particular related issues such as correlations and interferences between the two hard scatterings ,",
    "the role of the perturbative splitting contributions ( so - called `` 2v1 '' ) and the definition of double parton scattering cross section as well as double parton distributions have been addressed , see e.g.  @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "a @xmath0 pair is a very good candidate to study double parton scattering at the lhc due to relatively high production rates and subsequent decays into muons giving a clear and easily distinguishable signal .",
    "results for the production of @xmath0 pairs have been published by lhcb in @xcite , by d0 in @xcite , and by cms in @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , since then there has been a considerable interest to improve theoretical predictions for double @xmath0 production both for the sps and dps production modes @xcite .",
    "the calculation of conventional single parton scattering contributions to @xmath0 pair - production is non - trivial and requires specific methods to account for the non - perturbative mechanisms involved in meson production as well as the short - distance effects .",
    "two widely applied approaches are the colour - singlet model ( csm ) @xcite and non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) @xcite . in the framework of nrqcd ,",
    "until not long ago , only the lo predictions for hadronic production in the colour singlet production mode  @xcite , supplemented by the octet corrections  @xcite , were known .",
    "recently , the effects of relativistic corrections  @xcite , nlo corrections and selected nnlo qcd contributions @xcite as well as an application of the @xmath14 factorisation approach  @xcite have been investigated . additionally , the importance of including contributions from all possible @xmath15 fock state configurations relevant for prompt double @xmath0 production has been pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "this paper documents the predictions of sps and dps production of a pair of @xmath0 , delivered to the lhcb and atlas experiments for their ongoing studies of double parton scattering with run i data .",
    "the work presented here updates the study on @xmath0 pair - production reported in @xcite , which in turn was inspired by the first measurement of a double @xmath0 signal @xcite .",
    "furthermore , predictions for the current lhc run at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath16  tev are provided .",
    "we also perform a comparison with cms data @xcite and more thoroughly with theoretical predictions for double @xmath0 production obtained by another group @xcite .",
    "the outline is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "theo_setup ] , the theoretical setup of @xcite used for both the sps and dps cross section calculations is reviewed , followed by a listing of monte carlo parameters for event simulation in section  [ sec : monte_sim ] .",

    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this work , the sps contributions will be considered utilising a leading - order ( lo ) colour - singlet result presented in @xcite and including radiative corrections from parton showering .",
    "the details of the implementation are described in section  [ sec : monte_sim ] and the sps results obtained in this way are compared to the nlo calculations of  @xcite in section  [ sec : complansberg ] .    as it was pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the prompt production of @xmath0 mesons comprises feed - down from the decay of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at a non - negligible amount of roughly 85% .",
    "the sps calculation of @xcite is for direct production of @xmath0 pairs only , so in the following , all sps cross sections will be considered for prompt production , @xmath19 .",
    "the dps results implicitely include feed - down contributions due to the fit to experimental data .",
    "to include some higher - order effects in our sps predictions , in addition to using nlo pdfs , we enable initial - state radiation or parton showering within the ` herwig ` @xcite framework . furthermore ,",
    "if denoted , we also add effects of intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial - state partons using a gaussian model in ` herwig ` with a root mean square @xmath20 of 2  gev .",
    "we have checked that the predictions do not depend strongly on the actual numerical value , and it will be seen in the following sections that the effect of the intrinsic transverse momentum is rather mild on the distributions .",
    "dps production of a @xmath0-pair is described using an approximation in which the dps cross section factorises into a product of two hard - scattering cross sections describing single-@xmath0 production which are independent from each other : @xmath21 this customary approximation assumes factorization of the transverse and longitudinal components in the generalized parton distribution function .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a discussion of the validity of the approximation and the status of understanding factorization in dps .",
    "the sps cross section for single-@xmath0 production is given as @xmath22 with a sum over the initial - state flavours @xmath23 and the parton distribution functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 the partonic cross section for single @xmath0 production with the corresponding matrix elements @xmath26 and the phase space @xmath27 .",

    "theoretical description of single quarkonium production  @xcite is challenging even within the nrqcd framework @xcite .",
    "given that lhcb can trigger over low @xmath30 muons it is important to describe the low @xmath30 production accurately .",
    "therefore in this work we choose to model the low @xmath30 region and use the same setup as in @xcite .",

    "while the work of @xcite updated the fit parameters to include more recent measurements of single @xmath0 production , we have checked that the change in predictions for dps production is only moderate and well within the uncertainty on @xmath29 .",
    "we have also checked that for the available measurement of single @xmath0 production at 13 tev from the lhcb experiment @xcite with @xmath37 @xmath38b , the fit parameters still produce results at 13 tev consistent with the lhcb measurement , @xmath39 @xmath38b .      the public monte carlo event generator ` herwig-7.0.3 ` @xcite has been used to simulate double @xmath0 production at the lhc via sps .",

    "it should be noted that a variation of this parameter can be achieved by multiplying the sps cross section by a factor of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the new value of the wave function .",

    "unless otherwise specified , we use the cdf value of @xmath49  mb @xcite .",
    "a more recent double-@xmath0 study by d0 reports a lower value of @xmath50  mb @xcite , but given that most of other experiments measure higher values , see e.g.  @xcite , and the difficulty of theoretical modelling of @xmath29 , we choose the cdf value . with its relatively wide",
    "error bars it then accounts to a large extent for the observed span in values of @xmath51 .",

    "as found out in  @xcite , the shapes of the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions for the two types of production mechanisms remain very similar , justifying our effective approach of considering only the conventional 2v2 scattering .    in a similar manner as for the non - perturbative wave function at the origin ,",
