    "the important detector performance characteristics for this analysis are the resolution for reconstructing the positions of both the primary interaction and secondary decay vertices , the efficiency for reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles , the resolution for measuring charged track momenta , and the efficiency and the misidentification rates for identifying charged pions and kaons using information from the erenkov counters .",
    "the resolution for measuring the position of the primary vertex along the beam direction varies from about 240  @xmath52 m for the most downstream target foil to 450  @xmath52 m for the upstream foil .",
    "the variation is due to the extrapolation from the smd system and to multiple scattering in material downstream of the interaction .",
    "the mean number of reconstructed tracks used to fit the primary vertex is seven .",
    "the measured secondary vertex resolution depends on the decay mode , the momentum of the @xmath0 , and the selection criteria .",
    "for example , the vertex resolutions along the beam direction for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are 320 and 395  @xmath52 m , respectively , for a mean @xmath61 momentum of 65  gev/@xmath2 , and worsen by 33 and 36  @xmath52 m for every 10  gev/@xmath2 increase in @xmath61 momentum .    the total efficiency , including acceptance , for reconstructing charged tracks is approximately 80% for particles with a momentum greater than 30  gev/@xmath2 and drops to around 60% for particles of momentum 10  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "( this includes the inefficiency in the beam region . ) for tracks which pass through both magnets and have a momentum greater than 10 gev/@xmath2 , the average resolution for measuring charged particle momentum @xmath50 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the quadratic sum , and @xmath50 is in gev/@xmath2 .",
    "tracks which pass through only the first magnet have a resolution @xmath64 . the mean @xmath0 mass resolution for hadronic decays to two , three and four charged particles varies from 13 to 8  mev/@xmath65 as the decay multiplicity increases .",
    "the mass resolution varies by about a factor of 2 between low and high momentum @xmath0 mesons .    in most e791 analyses , the erenkov counters play a very important role @xcite .",
    "however , in this analysis with the two fully reconstructed d - meson decays , the erenkov counters play a minimal role .",
    "we use the erenkov counters for charged kaon identification .",
    "the kaon identification efficiencies and misidentification probabilities vary with longitudinal and transverse momentum and with the signatures required in the v cerenkov counters . for typical particle momenta in the range 20  gev/@xmath2 to 40  gev/@xmath2 , and for the nonstringent criteria used for some of the final states , in this analysis , the erenkov identification efficiency for a kaon ranged from 64% to 72% while the probability for a pion to be misidentified as a kaon ranged from 6% to 12% .",
    "a complete monte carlo simulation of the apparatus was used in this analysis to calculate the efficiency and investigate systematic effects .",
    "the simulation included all relevant physical processes such as multiple interactions and multiple scattering as well as geometrical apertures and resolution effects .",
    "it produced data in the same format as the real experiment .",
    "that monte carlo data was then reconstructed and analyzed with the same software as the real data .",
    "in each e791 event , we search for two charm mesons ( @xmath61 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) decaying to cabibbo - favored final states that can be reconstructed with relatively high efficiency : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the charge conjugate modes .",
    "to optimize the efficiency for reconstructing charm pairs , we search for both @xmath0 candidates simultaneously , rather than searching for the two candidates consecutively . in such a simultaneous search",
    ", we can require that one candidate or the other satisfy a fairly stringent selection criterion based on a particular variable used to discriminate charm decays from background , or that both candidates satisfy less stringent criteria .",
    "we start with a sample of events , each containing two candidate @xmath59 , @xmath72 or @xmath60 combinations with invariant mass between 1.7 and 2.0  gev@xmath73 , and rapidity in the range @xmath74 .",
    "these candidates are found by looping over all reconstructed tracks .",
    "the primary vertex is then refit after removing tracks which are associated with either candidate .",
    "no particle identification requirements are applied at this time .",
    "candidates are rejected if any charged track , the primary vertex or either of the two secondary vertices do not meet minimal fit quality criteria .",
    "the sample of candidate pairs that pass just these criteria is dominated by combinatoric backgrounds . to choose further selection criteria",
    ", we use this sample to represent background . to represent signal , we use reconstructed charm pairs generated with the monte carlo program described at the end of the previous section .",
    "we then search for selection criteria that provide optimal discrimination between signal and background .    in order to extract the signal , we use selection criteria defined by discrimination variables ( properties of the candidate event ) and minimum or maximum allowed values for each variable . for candidate pairs with the same final states (",
    "_ i.e. _ , both @xmath75 , both @xmath76 , or both @xmath77 ) , the same discrimination variables and maximum or minimum values are used for both candidate @xmath0 s ; for pairs with different final states , the discrimination variables are allowed to be different for the two candidate @xmath0 s .",
    "the discrimination variables used address the following questions .",
    "is a @xmath0 candidate consistent with originating from the primary interaction vertex ? is the vertex formed by the decay products of a @xmath0 candidate well separated from the primary interaction vertex and not inside a target foil ? do any of the decay products of the @xmath0 candidate appear to originate from the primary interaction vertex or from the other @xmath0 candidate vertex ? is the scalar sum of the squares of the transverse momenta of the @xmath0 candidate decay products , with respect to the @xmath0 candidate trajectory , indicative of a heavy meson decay ? is the erenkov information for the kaon candidate consistent with that for a real kaon ? as an example of the cuts used : the @xmath78 balance cut was 400 mev/@xmath2 , and the secondary vertices were separated from the primary vertices by 8 times the rms - uncertainty in the separation .    to optimize the significance of the signal , we repeatedly choose the selection criterion that maximizes @xmath79 while rejecting no more than 5% of the ( monte carlo ) signal .",
    "@xmath80 is the number of signal pairs satisfying the selection criterion , determined by monte carlo simulation , and @xmath81 is the number of background pairs , determined from the data .",
    "this requires properly normalizing the number of signal pairs in the monte carlo to the number of signal pairs in the data .",
    "when the background becomes dominated by pairs with only one true @xmath0 decay , we exclude from the background sample only those pairs in which both @xmath0 candidates lie in a narrow range around the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we iterate the procedure of finding the optimal selection criterion ( always allowing variables to be reused in subsequent iterations ) until the significance of the signal no longer increases .",
    "the selection criteria are optimized separately for each of five decay topologies of @xmath13 pairs : 2 - 2 , 3 - 3 , 2 - 3 , 2 - 4 and 3 - 4 , where each integer represents the number of charged particles in the decay .",
    "we find that selection criteria are more often applied to one @xmath0 candidate or the other , rather than to both , especially early in the optimization procedure . in several cases ,",
    "a criterion will be applied to one of the @xmath0 candidates , and a more stringent criterion involving the same discrimination variable will be applied to the other .    after optimizing our selection criteria",
    ", we end up with a sample of 9254 events in the data with both @xmath0 candidates in the mass range 1.7 to 2.0  gev@xmath73 and in the rapidity range @xmath82 to @xmath83 . only pairs",
    "in which the two @xmath0 candidates have opposite charm quantum numbers are included in this sample .",
    "no significant signal for @xmath84 or @xmath85 pairs is observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we plot the mass of the @xmath0 candidate versus the mass of the @xmath11 candidate , for all five types of pairs .",

    "the density of these points decreases linearly with increasing candidate-@xmath0 mass .",
    "pairs containing one real and one fake @xmath0 candidate appear as horizontal and vertical bands ( called @xmath0 and @xmath11 ridge events , respectively ) . in the center of the plot , we see an enhancement due to the crossing of the two bands and due to real pairs of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in this section we describe the analysis procedures by which we determine the number of signal events in the full data sample shown in fig .  [",

    "acceptance corrections include geometric acceptance , relative branching ratios , reconstruction efficiencies , and event selection efficiencies .",

    "the sensitivity of these scales indicates that the model may have several ways of obtaining accurate predictions , both by adjusting the model s parameters , and by adding higher order terms .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig34 ] , we look separately at the effects of parton showers , intrinsic transverse momentum , and hadronization . all distributions are obtained using the pythia / jetset event generator . the distributions obtained using the default settings ( * solid * ) include all three effects .",
    "we compare these default distributions to three sets of distributions that are obtained by including :    * _ only _ hadronization , but no parton shower evolution or intrinsic transverse momentum ( solid ) ; * _ only _ the parton shower evolution , but no intrinsic transverse momentum or hadronization ( dashed ) ; * _ only _ intrinsic transverse momentum , but no hadronization or parton shower evolution ( dotted ) .    for the longitudinal momentum distributions ( @xmath148 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath19 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 ) , the most important factor is whether or not hadronization is included .",
    "the two sets of distributions that include hadronization effects are quite similar ; the two sets of distributions that do not include hadronization effects are similar ; but the latter two sets of distributions differ significantly from the former two sets . in the pythia / jetset hadronization model ,",
    "the broadening of the longitudinal momentum distribution is the result of color - connecting the charm quark to a valence antiquark ( or diquark ) from one of the colliding hadrons and the anticharm quark to a valence quark from the other colliding hadron .",
    "all three higher - order effects broaden the leading - order delta function prediction for the @xmath157 distribution .",
    "the broadening due to the parton shower evolution , however , is significantly smaller than the broadening due to either the hadronization process or the addition of intrinsic transverse momentum ( @xmath285 gev@xmath311 ) .",
    "the latter two effects broaden the @xmath157 distribution by roughly the same amount .",
    "all three higher - order effects also broaden the leading - order delta function prediction for the @xmath289 distribution . in this case , however , the broadening due to the parton shower evolution is larger than the broadening due to either hadronization effects or the addition of intrinsic transverse momentum ( @xmath285 gev@xmath311 ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig35 ] , we investigate the degree to which the single - charm and charm - pair distributions are sensitive to variations in the amount of intrinsic transverse momentum added to the hard - scattering partons that collide to form a @xmath12 pair .",
    "all distributions are obtained from the pythia / jetset event generator , with default settings for all parameters except for the width of the gaussian intrinsic transverse momentum distribution , @xmath286 .",
    "when intrinsic transverse momentum is included , the hard - scattering partons from the colliding hadrons are no longer necessarily moving parallel to the colliding hadrons .",
    "the plane that is transverse to the axis of the parton - parton collision  which can not be determined experimentally  is no longer the same as the plane that is transverse to the beam axis .",
    "hence , including intrinsic transverse momentum smears the leading - order prediction @xmath312 . not surprisingly , the distributions that are most sensitive to variations in @xmath286 are those transverse distributions that are trivial at leading - order : @xmath204 , @xmath43 , and @xmath289 .",
    "as the width @xmath286 increases , these distributions become flatter .        the longitudinal momentum distributions  @xmath148 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath19 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310",
    " are relatively insensitive to all variations considered above , except for inclusion or omission of the pythia / jetset hadroproduction hadronization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig34 ] ) .",
    "the steepness of the invariant mass distribution is also sensitive to whether or not hadronization is included , as well as to the mass of the charm quark ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig31 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the measured distributions for these physics variables , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , provide a test of the pythia / jetset hadronization model  in particular , a test of the string topology scheme that color - connects the charm quark to a valence quark from one of the colliding hadrons and the anticharm quark to a valence quark from the other colliding hadron .    the transverse distributions @xmath204 , @xmath45 , @xmath43 , and @xmath289 are sensitive to almost all variations considered above because they are sensitive to the degree of correlation between the charm and anticharm transverse momenta . varying @xmath258 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig31 ] ) , @xmath261 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig32 ] ) , or @xmath262 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig33 ] ) in the next - to - leading order calculation changes the definition of the running coupling constant @xmath313 , which is approximately proportional to @xmath314 . as the coupling constant increases",
    " that is , as @xmath258 decreases , @xmath261 increases , or @xmath262 decreases  higher - order effects play a larger role , and consequently the charm and anticharm transverse momenta become less correlated .",
    "the other methods we discussed for including higher - order effects were parton showers , intrinsic transverse momentum , and hadronization .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we quantify the degree of correlation between the transverse momenta of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons from our @xmath13 data sample . the sensitivity of the nlo predictions to the arbitrary renormalization and factorization scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig33 ] ) indicates that higher - order perturbative corrections are important . in principle",
    ", one could determine the sets of theoretical parameters that generate predictions that are in good agreement with the full range of experimental results .",
    "the set of fit values chosen , however , may not be unique .",
    "the fit values of ( _ e.g. _ , the mass of the charm quark ) would depend on the values of the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "for example , if a renormalization scale of @xmath315 , rather than @xmath220 , is assumed , then a smaller value for @xmath286 or a larger value for @xmath258 could each be used to fit the data .",
