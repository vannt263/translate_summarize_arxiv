    "one of the simplest and most enduring ideas for extending general relativity is to include in the gravitational action terms which involve higher powers of the curvature tensor .",
    "for instance , if we require the theory to be @xmath0-even and include only terms up to quadratic in the curvature , the most general such action is @xcite @xmath1 } , \\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 have dimensions of inverse mass squared and @xmath5 is the gravitational coupling constant . since the theory is purely gravitational , the parameters are generically of the order of the inverse planck mass squared . consequently ,",
    "if we expand around flat space , the quadratic terms represent tiny , unobservable corrections to einstein s theory .",
    "it is of course also possible to drop the term linear in @xmath6 completely .",
    "however , the pure quadratic theory , when coupled to localized positive - definite matter , fails to give a solution which is asymptotically flat @xcite .",
    "thus to agree with newtonian gravity we must include the linear term .    the quadratic theory described by gained importance when stelle showed that , with @xmath7 , the theory is completely renormalizable , including its coupling to matter @xcite .",
    "the advent of string theory as a consistent theory of gravity , provided a further motivation for studying such theories , since quadratic corrections are explicitly present in the string effective action . in a different direction ,",
    "the quadratic theory with @xmath8 has been used to provide a purely gravitational theory of inflation @xcite .    here",
    "we shall be concerned with only the classical content of the quadratic theory .",
    "the most important feature is that the equations of motion include fourth - order derivatives of the metric , rather than only second - order derivatives , as in einstein s equations .",
    "the consequence is that there are more degrees of freedom in the theory than just the two graviton states .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , in solving the cauchy problem , one must now specify more initial conditions , giving the higher - order time derivatives of @xmath9 on the initial time - slice .",
    "these new degrees of freedom were first identified by stelle @xcite .",
    "if we follow his analysis , the first observation is that classically the action really only describes a two parameter class of theories .",
    "the gauss - bonnet combination @xmath10 is a total divergence and so does not contribute to the classical equations of motion .",
    "consequently , we can rewrite the action in terms of , for instance , only @xmath11 and the weyl tensor squared , @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and neither is restricted to be positive . keeping only the lowest order in the fluctuations of the metric around flat space , stelle showed that the theory contained , in addition to the usual graviton , two new fields .",
    "the @xmath11 term introduced a new scalar field with a squared - mass of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 term introduced a new spin - two field with a squared - mass of @xmath18 . however the latter field was ghost - like .",
    "this suggested that , while the quadratic theory is renormalizable , it unfortunately appears to be non - unitary .",
    "stelle s results raise two sets of questions .",
    "the first centers around extending his results to the complete non - linear theory .",
    "can we identify the new degrees of freedom in the full theory ?",
    "if so , can the theory be rewritten in a form where the new fields are made explicit and satisfy canonical second - order equations of motion ? such a reformulation removes the obscurity of the original higher - order field equations , allowing for a more intuitive analysis of the theory .",
    "for instance , we can look for the vacuum states of the theory .",
    "we can also see if , in the full theory , the spin - two field remains ghost - like .",
    "we note that we expect some solution of the ghost problem to exist , since string theory , while giving an effective action which includes the problematic quadratic terms , is nonetheless generally accepted as unitary .",
    "the second set of questions centers around the issue of coupling spin - two fields to gravity .",
    "it has long been known that there are problems of consistency when coupling massless fields of spin higher than one either to themselves or to other fields @xcite . even in the massive case",
    "we may have problems with preserving unitarity @xcite . yet",
    "quadratic gravity promises to be rewritable as a theory of a spin - two field consistently coupled to a scalar field and gravity .",
    "what is the form of the coupling ?",
    "how are the conditions required to ensure the field is pure spin - two realized ?",
    "in particular , is there a massless limit ?",
    "if so , how does the theory evade the problems of consistency which usually plague attempts to couple a massless spin - two field to gravity ?    in this paper",
    "we will address both sets of questions .",
    "we shall give a procedure for rewriting the full quadratic theory in a canonical second - order form .",
    "reducing the full action to a second - order form is not new , though the result does not seem to be widely known .",
    "it has been discovered and rediscovered in various places .",
    "the equivalence of full @xmath19 gravity to a second - order theory of a scalar field coupled dilatonically to gravity was first shown by teyssandier and tourrenc @xcite .",
    "whitt reproduced and extended these results , rewriting the second - order theory in canonical form by making a conformal rescaling of the metric @xcite .",
    "the full quadratic action , including a @xmath17 term , was first written in second - order form by magnano _",
    "_ @xcite and jakubiec and kijowski @xcite .",
    "some discussion of the particle content of the reduced theory , though only at the linearized level , was given by alonso _",
    "_ @xcite . what is new here , however , is to put the second - order action in a truly canonical form , separating the spin - two and scalar degrees of freedom",
    ". this will be the main thrust of this paper .",
    "it will provide us with a consistent theory of a massive spin - two field coupled to gravity .",
    "further we shall find that the theory has a sensible massless limit , providing an explicit example of a completely consistent coupling of a massless higher - spin field to gravity .",
    "we shall show how this new theory in fact falls under the class of coupled spin - two fields discussed by wald and cutler @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ spin2 ]",
    "we discuss the problem of coupling spin - two fields , either through self - interaction terms or to other fields . in the massive case ,",
    "the field must satisfy a set of generalized conditions to ensure that only the spin - two degrees of freedom propagate . in the massless case ,",
    "the problems are more extreme and imply that coupled theories are generically inconsistent .",
    "we discuss the nature of the inconsistency and , following @xcite and @xcite , show that consistency is equivalent to the presence of a new local symmetry .",
    "in section [ r2 ] we discuss @xmath19 theory , which introduces a new pure scalar degree of freedom .",
    "this provides us with an example of how to rewrite quadratic gravity in a second - order form and extract the canonical degrees of freedom .",
    "we discuss the form and vacuum structure of the reduced theory . in general , by a vacuum solution we mean a stable solution of the second - order theory .",
    "however , in this paper we will only consider a restricted set of vacua in which the new scalar or spin - two degrees of freedom are covariantly constant . within this context",
    ", we show that the only stable vacuum state corresponds to flat space . in section [ c2 ]",
    "we turn to the @xmath20 theory , which has a new pure spin - two degree of freedom . again rewriting the theory in a canonical second - order form ,",
    "we show that suitable conditions can be derived to ensure that the new field is indeed pure spin - two .",
    "we investigate the vacuum structure of the reduced theory within the restricted set , and find that flat space is the only stable vacuum solution and that the spin - two field fluctuations around the vacuum remain ghost - like . in section [ m2=0 ]",
    "we describe the massless limit of the second - order theory given in section [ c2 ] .",
    "the theory is shown to be consistent and the associated local symmetry is identified .",
    "we find that the theory is related to a class of theories discussed by cutler and wald @xcite . in section [ gen2 ] ,",
    "the general quadratic action is discussed . reducing to a second - order form",
    ", we make the complete canonical separation of the new scalar and spin - two degrees of freedom .",
    "again we discuss the vacuum structure of the theory , finding that flat space is the only stable vacuum solution and that the spin - two field remains ghost - like . in the final section",
    "we briefly present our conclusions .    throughout the paper our conventions are to use a metric of signature @xmath21 and to define the ricci tensor as @xmath22 .",
    "in this section we first describe the free equations of motion for a spin - two field and then discuss the problems of introducing interactions in both the massive and , more critically , massless cases . starting in flat space , we recall that any field theory must represent the symmetries of the spacetime , namely the poincar group .",
    "wigner showed that the unitary irreducible representations are classified by the casimir operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which physically represent the mass squared and the spin of the field quanta @xcite .",
    "one form of the irreducible representation with spin two and mass @xmath25 is in terms of a symmetric tensor @xmath26 , satisfying @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the first equation simply states that the field is an eigenstate of the operator @xmath23 with eigenvalue @xmath29 , while the second two conditions ensure that it is also an eigenstate of @xmath24 , with eigenvalue two .",
    "in fact these conditions can be derived from an action , first given by fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath30 } .\\ ] ] to understand how this action leads to the spin - two conditions and , we must consider the massive and massless cases separately . in the massive case ,",
    "we start from the corresponding equations of motion for @xmath26 , which read @xmath31 taking the divergence and the trace of these equations gives a pair of conditions , @xmath32 respectively , which imply that @xmath33 here the reader should note that the divergence of the left - hand side of the pauli - fierz equations vanishes identically , a fact that will be important when we discuss interacting massless spin - two fields . substituting the conditions back into the original equation of motion then gives @xmath34 and we find that we have succeeded in deriving the three conditions and , as required .",
    "these conditions act to constrain the number of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "we start with a symmetric tensor @xmath26 satisfying the massive klein - gordon equation , so that we might expect all the ten components of @xmath26 to propagate .",
    "however , consider the role of the spin conditions in solving the cauchy problem . to solve the klein - gordon equations ,",
    "we are required to specify twenty initial conditions , namely each component and its time derivative on some initial surface .",
    "the @xmath35 condition implies two constraints on the initial conditions , since @xmath36 and @xmath37 are initially both zero .",
    "the divergence condition implies a further eight constraints with @xmath38 and @xmath39 initially both set to zero .",
    "it is not clear that the latter expression is really a constraint since it includes second - order time derivatives .",
    "however these can be removed , since we must still satisfy the klein - gordon field equations .",
    "the constraint can then be rewritten as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 runs over the spatial indices .",
    "thus we are left with ten independent initial conditions , and so five degrees of freedom .",
    "put another way , ignoring any equations of motion , a general symmetric tensor @xmath26 can be decomposed into one spin - two field , one spin - one and two scalar fields , a total of ten degrees of freedom .",
    "the equations of motion derived from the pauli - fierz action then imply two conditions , which are just sufficient to set all but the five massive spin - two degrees of freedom to zero .",
    "it is worth noting that the divergence condition on @xmath26 can be promoted to the status of a conserved current .",
    "a local symmetry can be introduced in to the pauli - fierz action by writing it in a form somewhat akin to the stckleberg action used for quantizing massive gauge fields .",
    "we introduce a new vector field @xmath42 and write @xmath43             \\left[\\phi^{\\mu\\nu}+\\partial^{(\\mu}\\zeta^{\\nu)}\\right ]             - \\left[\\phi+\\partial^\\mu\\zeta_\\mu\\right]^2 \\right )          \\right ] } .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath44 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath45        = 0.\\ ] ] the presence of the @xmath42 field has no effect on the dynamic content of the theory since its field equation is already implied by the divergence of the @xmath26 equation of motion .",
    "however , it does introduce a new gauge symmetry .",
    "the action is invariant under the combined transformation @xmath46 we note that the original pauli - fierz action corresponds to the modified action with the gauge choice @xmath47 .",
    "further , we find that the conserved current for the gauge symmetry , in the gauge @xmath47 , is none other than @xmath48 , and thus the divergence condition becomes a consequence of a local symmetry as promised",
    ". we shall use this stckleberg formulation in separating the spin - two and scalar degrees of freedom in the full quadratic gravity theory as described in section [ gen2 ] .",
    "finally we turn to the massless spin - two theory .",
    "the consequence of setting @xmath49 is that we can no longer derive the conditions from the field equations following from the pauli - fierz action .",
    "however , we also find that the action has a new local gauge symmetry .",
    "it is now invariant under the transformation @xmath50 this immediately allows four of the ten components of @xmath26 to be transformed away , simply by choosing a gauge .",
    "in fact , we must choose the gauge @xmath51 in order to satisfy one of the spin - two conditions .",
    "a residual gauge freedom , namely transformations of the form with @xmath52 , remains . as is the case of a massless gauge field , since the gauge @xmath51 implies that the remaining components of @xmath26 satisfy the massless klein - gordon equation , we find that the residual gauge symmetry is sufficient to set @xmath36 to zero together with three other linear combinations of the components of @xmath26 .",
    "thus we are left with only two propagating degrees of freedom , the two different helicity states of a spinning , massless field .",
    "thus far we have described the content of the massive and massless free field equations for spin - two .",
    "we would now like to consider interactions , either through self - coupling terms or couplings to other fields .",
    "to provide an example of the issues which arise , consider coupling a spin - two field to gravity .",
    "the most natural approach is to take the pauli - fierz action , but to promote the ordinary derivatives to full covariant derivatives , so that @xmath53 } .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the corresponding field equations are then @xmath54 again with the same form as the flat - space equations , but with ordinary derivatives replaced with covariant derivatives .",
    "let us now try and derive the trace and divergence conditions which in flat space restricted @xmath26 to describe only spin - two .",
    "taking a trace of the field equations , as before , we obtain the condition @xmath55 however , when we take the divergence of the field equations new terms arise because the covariant derivatives do not commute .",
    "we find that @xmath56 consider first the massive case .",
    "in flat space , the left - hand side of was zero , so that substituting this equation into immediately gave @xmath35 , and then hence , substituting back into , the divergence condition @xmath51 .",
    "here this is no longer true .",
    "we note however that a generalized form of the divergence condition does still hold .",
    "the expressions involve only first - order time derivatives of @xmath26 , and , as such , represent four constraint equations for @xmath26 , the same way @xmath51 did in the flat - space case .",
    "we might also hope to derive a generalized form of @xmath35 , for instance by taking the divergence of and substituting into .",
    "however , we find that no such condition , involving only first - order time derivatives of @xmath26 , can be found .",
    "we are left to conclude that , though not inconsistent , the gravitationally coupled theory no longer describes pure spin - two . in terms of the cauchy problem , the generalized divergence condition implies that only six components of @xmath26 propagate independently , but , without a generalized trace condition , we can not further reduce the number to the five degrees of freedom of a massive spin - two field .",
    "this discussion provides us with a general prescription for determining if an interacting theory describes pure spin - two .",
    "there must be five conditions derivable from the equations of motion .",
    "if @xmath57 are the other fields in a second - order theory these conditions must be of the form @xmath58 the first four expressions are the generalized divergence conditions .",
    "linearizing in @xmath26 and @xmath57 , they must agree with the free conditions , @xmath51 .",
    "the final expression is the generalized trace condition , and it must read @xmath35 in the linearized limit . in general , for the conditions to be constraints on the initial conditions when solving the cauchy problem for the theory , they must not involve the second - order time - derivative of @xmath26 . here , for simplicity , we shall assume they involve none of the second - order derivatives .    in the massless case",
    ", the problems are more extreme .",
    "we note first that with @xmath49 the action no longer has a local symmetry . transformations of the form , with ordinary derivatives replaced with covariant derivatives , fail because the covariant derivatives do not commute .",
    "critically , we also find that , with @xmath49 , the only way to satisfy the condition , for any curvature @xmath59 , is to set @xmath60 .",
    "the only alternative is to consider not as a condition on @xmath26 , but as a condition on the curvature .",
    "this can in some cases be a satisfactory resolution .",
    "for instance , the spin-@xmath61 gravitino equation in supergravity gives a similar condition .",
    "however , in this case , the condition is implied by the einstein equations and so is automatically satisfied on shell .",
    "aragone and deser have investigated the possibility of a similar solution to the problem of coupling a massless spin - two field to gravity @xcite . however , for a large class of couplings , they showed no such mechanism is possible .",
    "in fact , these problems of consistency and the loss of local gauge invariance are related .",
    "wald @xcite , and earlier ogievetsky and polubarinov @xcite , have used this connection as a way of deriving the possible consistent spin - two theories . to understand this relationship ,",
    "let us first , following wald @xcite , define the general consistency problem .",
    "for any massless , interacting , spin - two theory , we can separate the action into a free part , which is the massless pauli - fierz action , and a part describing the interactions , @xmath62             + s_{\\text{i}}\\left[\\phi_{\\mu\\nu},\\phi_i\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath57 are the other fields in the theory .",
    "if , for example , we couple to gravity , the correction terms to make the ordinary derivatives in the pauli - fierz action into covariant derivatives will be included in @xmath63 .",
    "the equations of motion following from the general action can be written as , @xmath64 where we make an expansion such that @xmath65 is @xmath66-th order in the fields @xmath26 and @xmath57 .",
    "we know that the first - order expression @xmath67 must come from the free part of the action and so is none other than the left - hand side of the massless pauli - fierz equations .",
    "suppose we now look for a perturbative solution of .",
    "we denote the leading - order , linearized solution by @xmath68 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath69 we can similarly solve for @xmath70 , the linearized solution of the @xmath57 equations of motion . now consider solving for the quadratic corrections to @xmath68 , denoted @xmath71 .",
    "they must satisfy @xmath72 as we noted earlier @xmath73 is identically zero for any @xmath74 .",
    "thus , if we take the divergence of equation , we are left with the relation @xmath75 this implies a condition on @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "the result is that not all the linearized solutions are necessarily consistent with the equation for the solution to the next order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "as we go to higher orders in the expansion , we shall find more and more conditions .",
    "indeed it may be that none of the linearized solutions are compatible with these conditions , or as we found in the case of the naive coupling of a spin - two field to gravity only the trivial solution @xmath60 survives .",
    "this lack of a sensible procedure for perturbatively solving the field equations is one way of defining the problem of inconsistency .",
    "to avoid inconsistency , we require to be satisfied by any solution of the linearized equations , and that the similar conditions , arising at higher - orders in the perturbation expansion , are also automatically satisfied by solving the field equations to one order lower in the expansion . one way of ensuring this is if the full interacting action has a local symmetry of a particular form .",
    "for a second - order theory , we require the action to be invariant under infinitesimal transformations of the form @xcite @xmath76 here the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are taken to be general functions of @xmath26 and @xmath57 , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 may also depend on @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "when linearizing the transformation in @xmath26 and @xmath57 , all the coefficients must vanish , so that we return to the old symmetry of the massless pauli - fierz action .",
    "if one calculates the corresponding conserved current , as is done in wald @xcite and ogievetsky and polubarinov @xcite , one finds that , order by order in the perturbation expansion , the divergence conditions , such as , are satisfied and there is no consistency problem .",
    "we also note that , since the symmetry has the same form as the gauge symmetry of the free action , we expect to be able to eliminate all but two propagating components of @xmath26 , so that it truly describes a massless spin - two field .",
    "both ogievetsky and polubarinov @xcite and wald @xcite have used this formalism to prove that a generally covariant theory , such as einstein gravity , where the @xmath26 field really describes the metric of a curved spacetime , is the only consistent theory of a single spin - two field .",
    "cutler and wald @xcite also considered consistent collections of spin - two fields .",
    "this will include any consistent theory of a massless spin - two field coupled to gravity .",
    "wald @xcite obtained the very interesting result that such theories correspond to theories of a metric on algebra - valued manifolds , where the coordinates are elements of an associative , commutative algebra . here , we shall not be concerned with this geometrical interpretation , but it will be important to note wald s result that at least one of the spin - two fields in a consistent theory must be ghost - like .",
    "we shall return to this issue in section [ m2=0 ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "for a massive , interacting , symmetric tensor field , we require a set of conditions to hold if the field is to describe only spin - two . in the massless case",
    ", we require the action to have a local symmetry of the form in order for the theory to be consistent and describe spin - two .",
    "these are the conditions we must show apply when we attempt to extract the spin - two degree of freedom from quadratic gravity .",
    "before turning to general quadratic gravity , let us first consider the special case where we include only the scalar curvature quadratic correction , so that @xmath84 from stelle s linearized calculations , we expect the @xmath11 term to introduce a new scalar degree of freedom into the theory . extracting this degree of freedom , by rewriting the theory in a canonical second - order form , will provide us with a simple example of a procedure we shall use throughout this paper . having obtained the reduced , second - order theory , we shall briefly discuss its physical content , in particular the vacuum solutions .    in rewriting the theory in a canonical second - order form , we will follow whitt @xcite .",
    "the procedure is first to introduce an auxiliary field for the scalar curvature @xmath6 , thus giving an action with second - order equations of motion .",
    "this is the analog of forming the helmholtz lagrangian , which reduces a second - order theory to a first - order theory in terms of field variables and conjugate momenta .",
    "here we instead reduce a fourth - order theory to second - order , with the auxiliary field playing the role of the conjugate momentum .",
    "then , by redefining the fields to grow an explicit kinetic energy term for the new field , the action is transformed to the canonical form for a scalar field coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "thus , introducing a dimensionless auxiliary field @xmath85 , the action can be rewritten as @xmath86 } \\notag \\\\       & = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2 } \\int { d^4x \\sqrt{-g } \\left [         \\left(1+{\\lambda}\\right ) r - \\tfrac{3}{2 } m^2 { \\lambda}^2 \\right ] } .",
    "\\label{r2auxs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath85 equation of motion is algebraic , giving @xmath87 .",
    "substituting this solution back into the action clearly returns one to the original higher - derivative form and so the theories are equivalent",
    ". the equations of motion for @xmath9 and @xmath85 are now second - order , but the action is not yet in a canonical form . with this in mind ,",
    "consider the transformation of the ricci scalar under a conformal rescaling of the metric .",
    "if @xmath88 , in terms of the new metric and the covariant derivative @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 comparing with we see that by choosing @xmath91 , and conformally rescaling the metric we can produce a canonical einstein - hilbert term .",
    "furthermore we also generate a canonical kinetic energy term .",
    "thus , transforming from @xmath92 to @xmath93 and dropping total derivative terms , the action becomes @xmath94 } .\\ ] ] this is the canonical form for einstein gravity coupled to a new scalar field @xmath95 and reproduces the result derived by whitt @xcite .",
    "one subtlety here is that @xmath95 is only defined as a real field for @xmath96 .",
    "note , however , that despite this restriction on @xmath85 , the range of @xmath95 is unrestricted with @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath98 we must introduce , instead , the real field @xmath99 , the effect of which is to change the sign of the overall normalization of the action . at the one special point @xmath100 ,",
    "the conformal rescaling becomes degenerate .",
    "thus at this point the action can not be put in canonical form , although there is no problem with the non - canonical formulation in terms of @xmath85 . here , and throughout this paper , we will restrict our attention to the range of the auxiliary field(s ) for which the transformed action has , when possible , the usual normalization .",
    "finally , we also note that strictly the action is not quite in canonical form since the scalar field @xmath95 is dimensionless and has a non - canonical normalization of its kinetic energy .",
    "this is , of course , easily remedied by introducing a dimensionful rescaled field @xmath101 . for simplicity , throughout this paper , we will not make this final trivial rescaling",
    ".    clearly the scalar field kinetic energy in action has the usual sign , and , therefore , is not a ghost . the @xmath102 and @xmath95 equations of motion following from have the conventional forms @xmath103 -            \\tfrac32{\\overline g}_{\\mu\\nu}v(\\chi ) , \\\\ \\label{canr2chieom }     { \\overline \\nabla}^2\\chi = \\frac{dv}{d\\chi},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] respectively , where here the potential is given by @xmath104 consider the vacuum solutions of these equations . if we restrict ourselves to solutions where the scalar field is covariantly constant , @xmath105 it follows from , that , @xmath95 must extremize that potential .",
    "the @xmath102 equation of motion then implies that the spacetime is a space of constant curvature , a desitter or anti - desitter solution , with @xmath106 since the original metric @xmath9 is related to @xmath102 by a conformal rescaling , @xmath107,and @xmath95 is constant , it follows that @xmath108 thus these vacuum states are also spaces of constant curvature with respect to the original metric , although the radius of curvature is in general different .",
    "the potential energy is plotted in figure  [ fig : r2v ] . for @xmath109",
    "the potential has a single stable minimum at @xmath110 , with scalar excitations of mass @xmath25 , which we recall is generically of order of the planck mass .",
    "for @xmath111 we have no stable minimum .",
    "therefore , the only stable vacuum solution is for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . since @xmath112",
    ", it follows that @xmath113 and , hence , that @xmath114 .",
    "that is , the only stable vacuum solution where the scalar field is constant is trivial flat space with vanishing scalar vacuum expectation value .    in closing this section",
    "it is worth emphasizing two facts .",
    "the first is that it is clear from this discussion that the quadratic gravity action which involves only the metric field @xmath9 , in the range of the scalar curvature given by @xmath115 , is completely equivalent to the action which involves not only a metric field @xmath102 described by the usual einstein theory , but also a massive , non - ghost scalar field @xmath95 .",
    "the conclusion is that the modification of einstein s theory obtained by adding the @xmath11 term in , increases the number of propagating degrees of freedom contained in @xmath9 from the two helicity states of the usual graviton to three .",
    "this can easily be seen by considering the fourth - order @xmath9 equations of motion associated with action .",
    "the formalism we have used here , introducing the auxiliary field @xmath85 and transforming to the @xmath93 variables , simply makes this fact manifest . we want to emphasize that the new degree of freedom is physical and",

    "further , its field equation , @xmath199 , is already implied by the @xmath119 equation of motion .",
    "the action is thus completely equivalent to the action in the last line of .",
    "more significantly , by including the field @xmath42 , we introduce a new gauge symmetry .",
    "namely the action is invariant under the combined transformations @xmath200 in this language , the original expression corresponds to the gauge choice @xmath47 . as in the free case",
    ", the divergence condition becomes the conserved current condition ( in the @xmath47 gauge ) for the symmetry .",
    "we can now understand the connection between the two spin - two fields @xmath119 and @xmath188 .",
    "they are related by gauge transformations , though in a rather subtle way since they are defined with respect to two different metrics .",
    "@xmath119 is defined in the @xmath9 frame while @xmath188 is defined in the conformally rescaled @xmath184 frame .",
    "to see the relationship explicitly , we start by choosing the gauge @xmath201 in the action . as already stated , this is the same action as given in , just expressed in a different gauge .",
    "if we now make the conformal rescaling to @xmath182 , as before , the @xmath202 term generates derivative terms coupling @xmath119 with @xmath95 .",
    "however , with this particular gauge choice , we find that such terms so arrange themselves to give , after some algebra and dropping a total derivative term , @xmath203                \\left[\\pi^{\\mu\\nu}-{m_2}^{-2}{\\tilde \\nabla}^\\mu{\\tilde \\nabla}^\\nu\\chi\\right ]                - \\left[\\pi-{m_2}^{-2}{\\tilde \\nabla}^2\\chi\\right]^2 \\right )             \\right].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we recognize this as none other than the action in the last line of , but instead of the gauge @xmath204 , we have @xmath205 .",
    "the subtlety is that the new action is gauge - fixed with respect to the new metric @xmath184 , that is , we have @xmath206 not @xmath207 entering the action .",
    "thus , the procedure of introducing the auxiliary fields in two stages using the conformal invariance of the weyl terms , is equivalent to first choosing a particular gauge in the @xmath9 frame .",
    "then , with this choice , the transformed action arranges into a ( different ) gauge - fixed form in the new @xmath184 frame , thereby removing the coupling between the spin - two and scalar kinetic terms .",
    "this decomposition is not unique , but has advantage of also largely decoupling the kinetic energies for the two fields in the final nonlinear expression .",
    "in summary , in this section we have been able to rewrite the general action quadratic in the curvature tensors in a canonical form , which makes the new scalar and spin - two degrees explicit at the non - linear level .",
    "the action has the correct quadratic limit , and we have shown that the spin - two field satisfies a pair of generalized conditions which constrain the number of independent components to the five degrees of freedom of a massive spin - two field .",
    "in the linearized limit these conditions become the trace and divergence conditions of the free pauli - fierz equation of motion .",
    "we found that the theory has a single vacuum state , when the fields are covariantly constant , at @xmath197 , with the mass of the scalar and spin - two excitations generically of the order of the planck - scale .",
    "further , we made explicit the ghost nature of the spin - two field about this vacuum , demonstrating that this problem persists in the full non - linear theory .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , this paper has centered on two questions .",
    "one is how to rewrite quadratic gravity in a canonical second - order form , extracting the new scalar and spin - two degrees of freedom .",
    "the other is how such a canonical theory provides a consistent description of a coupled spin - two field .",
    "two interesting questions arise .",
    "the first is to understand the connection between wald s geometrical theories of multiple spin - two fields and higher - derivative gravitation . in this context",
    ", one might consider actions which involve higher derivatives of the curvature tensors .",
    "this would imply more degrees of freedom , either new scalar or spin - two fields .",
    "if such theories can be rewritten in a canonical second - order form , they should provide examples of consistently coupled theories with multiple spin - two fields",
    ". it would be interesting to see how wald s algebras are realized in such theories , and what additional structure they imply for the higher - derivative theory .",
    "the second question is whether non - trivial vacua exist in more general theories of higher - derivative gravity .",
    "naively , all such theories represent planck - scale corrections to einstein gravity and so apparently have no effect on low - energy physics .",
    "however , this assumes that flat space is the only vacuum state in the theory .",
    "generally one must always use the full theory to find the vacuum states and only then , having chosen a particular vacuum , make the low - energy expansion .",
    "thus higher - derivative terms can not be neglected when determining the correct vacuum state for the low - energy physics . for quadratic theories we found that the only stable vacuum was trivial flat space . to investigate more complicated theories",
    ", we can essentially use the same techniques we have developed in this paper .",
    "( some discussion of reducing more general higher - derivative theories of gravity to a second - order form has already been given in the literature @xcite . ) recently , this has allowed us to show that non - trivial vacua seem to be a generic feature of more general theories @xcite , indicating that higher - derivative corrections to gravity may have a role to play in low - energy physics .",
