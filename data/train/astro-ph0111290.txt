    "little accretion is found to take place over timescales of @xmath1 years , and by extrapolation , over the age of the solar system ( levison & stewart 2001 ) .",
    "earlier simulations by brunini & fernandez ( 1999 ) showed accretion of the ice giants in several @xmath2 years with the same initial conditions , but later simulations , performed with an improved integrator , require that bodies be enhanced in radius by at least a factor of ten , relative to bodies having the density of uranus and neptune , in order to recover the previous result ( brunini 2000 )",
    ". therefore , uranus and neptune are unlikely to have formed from a late stage of mergers among large protoplanets , analogous to the putative final phase of planet formation in the terrestrial zone ( eg .",
    "wetherill 1996 , chambers & wetherill 1998 ) .",
    "the oligarchic growth model , in which the principal growth mode is accretion of small planetesimals by a protoplanet , also produces timescales which are too long ( kokubo and ida 2000 , thommes 2000 ) , unless the feeding zones of uranus and neptune can be replenished quickly enough with low random velocity planetesimals from elsewhere in the nebula ( bryden , lin and ida 2000 ) .",
    "thommes , duncan & levison ( 1999 ) , hereafter tdl99 , develop an alternative model to in - situ formation for the origin of uranus and neptune .",
    "beginning with four or more planetary embryos of 10 - 15 m@xmath3 in the jupiter - saturn region , they explore through n - body simulation the evolution of the system after one of these bodies ( and in one case , two at the same time ) accretes a massive gas envelope to become a gas giant .",
    "they find that the remaining giant protoplanets are predominantly scattered outward .",
    "dynamical friction with the planetesimal disk subsequently recircularizes their orbits , which leads , in about half the simulations performed , to a configuration quite similar to the present outer solar system , with the scattered giant protoplanets taking the roles of uranus , neptune and saturn .",
    "these results suggest that uranus and neptune are actually potential gas giant cores which formed in the same region as jupiter and saturn , but lost the race to reach runaway gas accretion .    here",

    "hayashi ( 1981 ) estimated the minimum primordial surface density of solids in the outer solar system to be    @xmath4    the requirement that jupiter and saturn s cores be massive enough to have initiated runaway gas accretion suggests that they are @xmath5 10 m@xmath3 in mass ( mizuno et al 1978 , pollack et al 1996 ) .",
    "interior models are consistent with such a core mass , but also allow a coreless jupiter ( guillot 1999 ) . we assume in this work that both jupiter and saturn began as @xmath5 10 m@xmath3 bodies ; putting gas giant cores and ice giant cores on the same footing is necessary in the `` strong '' version of our model , though it is not essential to the basic mechanism ; we discuss variations on the model in section [ discussion ] .    a surface density of 2.7 g/@xmath6 was likely too low to form a @xmath5 10 m@xmath3 body at 5 au before the gas was removed from the protoplanetary disk .",
    "lissauer ( 1987 ) finds that a surface density of 15 - 30 g/@xmath6 is needed to allow formation of jupiter s core on a timescale of @xmath7 years , while the model of pollack et al ( 1996 ) , which includes concurrent accretion of solids and gas , produces jupiter in less than @xmath8 years with 10 g/@xmath6 .",
    "the formation of giant planet cores may have been triggered at least in part by the enhancement in the solids surface density beyond the `` snow line '' , where water goes from being a gaseous to a solid constituent of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "in fact , outward diffusion and subsequent freezing of water vapor from the inner solar system may have resulted in a large local density enhancement around 5 au , perhaps yielding a surface density even higher than 30 g/@xmath6 ( stevenson & lunine 1988 ) . here",
    "we assume a power law surface density , @xmath9 the above discussion suggests @xmath10 10 to 30 g/@xmath6 as a plausible surface density at 5 au .",
    "allowing , also , the exponent @xmath11 to vary between 1 and 2 , one obtains a total mass in the jupiter - saturn ( j - s ) region in excess of 40 m@xmath3 , and as high as 180 m@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the region originally contained significantly more solids than ended up in the cores of jupiter and saturn .",
    "runaway growth ( eg . wetherill & stewart 1989 , kokubo & ida 1996 ) transitions to a slower , self - limiting mode called `` oligarchic growth '' ( ida & makino 1993 , kokubo & ida 1998 , 2000 ) when the largest protoplanets are still orders of magnitude less than an earth mass everywhere in the nebula .",
    "oligarchic growth has previously only been demonstrated to take place interior to about 3 au ( weidenschilling & davis 2000 ) .",
    "though kokubo and ida make estimates of protoplanet mass and growth timescales in the giant planet region , they point out that their simulations are restricted to annuli which are narrow compared to their radii , and thus can not make strong predictions about how oligarchic growth works over a wide range in semimajor axis ( kokubo and ida 2000 ) .",
    "however , their most recent simulations ( kokubo & ida 2000b ) span a range of 0.5 to 1.5 au , and show oligarchic growth proceeding in an outward - expanding `` wave '' over time .",
    "also , thommes ( 2000 ) and thommes , duncan & levison ( 2001 ) perform numerical simulations which suggest that oligarchic growth does take place in the outer solar system , and proceeds on approximately the timescales predicted using the approach of kokubo & ida ( 2000 ) .    assuming that protoplanets remain approximately evenly spaced in hill radii while growing  as is characteristic of oligarchic growth  their final mass is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the protoplanet semimajor axis",
    ", @xmath14 is the spacing between adjacent protoplanets in hill radii @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the fraction of the total mass in the zone @xmath17 $ ] incorporated into the protoplanet ( kokubo and ida 2000 ) . using numerical simulations , kokubo & ida ( 1998 )",
    "show that @xmath18 .",
    "models of giant planet formation by concurrent planetesimal and gas accretion suggest a surface density profile @xmath19 ( pollack et et 1996 ) . using this in eq .",
    "[ oligarchic_mass ] , one obtains a protoplanet mass independent of semimajor axis . adopting @xmath20 and a spacing of n=7.5 hill radii , one must then set the accreted mass fraction to about 0.8 in order to obtain a protoplanet mass of 10 m@xmath3 . with this spacing , between three and five such bodies fit between 5 and 10 au .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that this region originally contained more than just the future solid cores of jupiter and saturn . at the same time , the more recent simulations of thommes , duncan and levison ( 2001 , preprint ) indicate that accretion is quite inefficient in the outer solar system ; even in the jupiter - saturn region , the above value of @xmath16 is probably overly optimistic , and a correspondingly higher density of solids in this region may have been necessary to form gas giant cores .",
    "but as we find ( section [ set_2 ] ) , a higher - density disk actually tends to increase the `` success rate '' of the model .",
    "in the nucleated instability picture of gas giant formation , there are three distinct phases of growth ( pollack et al 1996 ) : in phase 1 ( which itself encompasses the sub - phases of runaway and oligarchic growth ; see section [ oligarchic implications ] above ) , a solid core grows until it depletes most of the material in its feeding zone .",
    "phase 2 is characterized by much slower growth , with gas accretion gradually coming to dominate over solids accretion . after a time of order several myrs ,",
    "the protoplanet contains comparable masses of gas and solids ; around this time , the third phase of runaway gas accretion sets in and proceeds on a timescale of @xmath21 years .",
    "one of the protoplanets in the jupiter - saturn region must have been the first to reach this point .",
    "shorter formation timescales at smaller heliocentric radii argue for jupiter having formed before saturn .",
    "the relatively long time spent by a protoplanet on the `` plateau '' of phase 2 means that several protoplanets could plausibly find themselves there by the time the first of them makes it to phase 3 .",
    "furthermore , if the winner has a broad enough margin of victory , its rivals will have only had time to accumulate a few m@xmath3 of gas , thus resembling the present - day ice giants in both solids and gas mass .    a body increasing its mass from 10 m@xmath3 to jupiter s mass",
    ", m@xmath22 = 314 m@xmath3 , expands its hill radius by a factor of about three .",
    "the adjacent protoplanets will therefore have a high likelihood of being gravitationally scattered . in a three - body system  sun , jupiter and a single protoplanet",
    " a jupiter - crossing protoplanet would continue to have close encounters with its much more massive scatterer , and so would remain coupled to it , unless it were scattered onto an unbound orbit and left the system altogether .",
    "in reality , however , one expects that as it crosses beyond the jupiter - saturn region , a body will encounter a less accretionally evolved part of the protoplanetary disk , consisting predominantly of much smaller bodies . as a result ,",
    "the protoplanet will experience dynamical friction .",
    "this will tend to reduce the eccentricity of its orbit .",
    "if the eccentricity decays enough , the protoplanet s perihelion will be lifted away from jupiter , thus decoupling it from its scatterer .",
    "insofar as one can neglect interactions with other scattered protoplanets , its eccentricity will then monotonically decrease until it reaches equilibrium with the planetesimals .",
    "the eccentricity rate of change due to dynamical friction on a body of mass @xmath23 in a swarm of mass @xmath24 bodies can be expressed as ( weidenschilling et al 1997 ) @xmath25 and a similar expression gives the time evolution of the inclination .",
    "@xmath26 is the rms eccentricity of the mass @xmath24 bodies , and @xmath27 is a definite integral depending on the inclinations and eccentricities , defined in stewart & wetherill ( 1988 ) .",
    "the coefficient c is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , @xmath30 the local keplerian velocity , @xmath31 the spatial mass density of the swarm , and @xmath32 is approximately the ratio of the maximum encounter distance between the body @xmath23 and a member of the population of the swarm , to the maximum separation that results in a physical encounter ( stewart & wetherill 1988 ) .    an equilibrium is therefore reached when @xmath33 this also means that as long as @xmath34 the eccentricity decay rate of the body @xmath23 will only depend on the spatial mass density of the planetesimal disk , and will be essentially independent of the individual masses of the planetesimals .",
    "this feature will be exploited in the numerical simulations below .",
    "putting the pieces together , one can now envision a scenario in which a ) a rapidly growing jupiter scatters its smaller neigbours outward , and b ) these `` failed cores '' are decoupled from jupiter and ultimately evolve onto circular , low - inclination orbits in the outer solar system .",
    "tdl99 performed three series of numerical simulations to test this model ; about half of the simulations produced a stable final configuration qualitatively similar to the present - day solar system . here , we expand on the earlier work , performing simulations to assess the effect of other planetesimal disk density profiles and of proto - jupiter being initially not the innermost giant protoplanet .",
    "we also investigate how sensitive this scenario is to the timing of saturn s final stage of growth , relative to that of jupiter .",
    "simulations are once again performed using the proven symba symplectic integrator ( duncan , levison & lee 1998 ) .",

    "the above density profile is steeper than those of tdl99 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the total disk mass between 10 and 60 au ( 106 m@xmath3 ) is about half that of the first two sets of runs in our earlier work ( 216 m@xmath3 ) , and similar to that in the third run ( 119 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the truncation at 60 au is to keep the number of bodies in the simulations tractably small ; in reality the planetesimal disk may have extended for hundreds of au , far beyond the presently visible kuiper belt .",
    "observational evidence does point to the possibility of a truncation of the belt at @xmath5 50 au ( eg .",
    "chiang & brown 1999 ) .",
    "but if a `` kuiper cliff '' exists , it is not necessarily primordial .    since we truncate the disk at a location where the planetesimal surface density is already very low ( 0.07 g/@xmath38 for the density profile of eq .",
    "[ density_set1 ] ) , one expects this not to have a strong effect on the evolution of any scattered protoplanets which cross the region @xmath39 au . as a test",

    "no systematic difference in the 10 m@xmath3 body s semimajor axis evolution over the first few myrs is apparent between the two different disk sizes .",
    "the eccentricity , however , tends to be damped more rapidly in a 200 au disk .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the subsequent runs somewhat underestimate the effectiveness with which those scattered protoplanets which cross beyond 60 au are circularized , if the disk was in fact larger . in particular , a planetesimal disk with a radius of hundreds of au may allow the retention of protoplanets which in our runs are scattered strongly enough to become unbound ; we will explore this possibility in future work .",
    "the simulated disk is made up of equal - mass `` planetesimals '' , each having a mass of 0.2 m@xmath3 . at twice the mass of mars",
    ", these bodies far exceed the actual characteristic mass of planetesimals in the early outer solar system . in reality planetesimals",

    "lissauer 1987 ) .",

    "as mentioned in section [ scatter+circ ] , when the large bodies have eccentricities high enough that eq .",
    "[ mass_indep_condition ] is satisfied , the eccentricity decay timescale will be effectively independent of the planetesimal masses .",
    "thus despite the large planetesimal masses , the initial strength of eccentricity damping will be realistic .",
    "the equilibrium eccentricity condition eq .",
    "[ dynamical_friction_equilibrium ] , however , does depend on the planetesimal mass , so the equilibrium eccentricity reached by a large body among the planetesimals in the simulation will tend to be unrealistically high .",
    "of course , a true equilibrium between protoplanets and planetesimals will not exist anyway , since mutual perturbations among the protoplanets will also have an effect .",
    "the initial planetesimal eccentricities and inclinations are given a rayleigh distribution in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , ( kokubo and ida 1992 ) with @xmath45 , @xmath46 . in the numerical integrations ,",
    "the planetesimals are treated as a `` second - class '' , non - self - interacting population .",
    "thus they are perturbed in their keplerian orbits only by forces from the protoplanets , not each other .",
    "the protoplanets , on the other hand , are subject to forces from each other as well as from the planetesimals .",
    "this serves two purposes : it makes the simulations run much faster , since for @xmath47 second - class bodies , the computation time scales as @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "also , it prevents unrealistically strong self - stirring of the disk . of course , not modeling planetesimal interactions means that collective planetesimal effects are not accounted for .",
    "wave phenomena could have had an important effect on the evolution of the planetesimal disk velocity distribution ( eg . ward and hahn 1998 ) , provided the disk was sufficiently massive and dynamically cold .",
    "however , it is unlikely that significant wave phenomena could persist once the initial scattering has taken place and the planetesimal disk has been stirred by eccentric 10 m@xmath3 bodies .",
    "also unmodeled is nebular gas , either as a source of aerodynamic drag ( relevant for small planetesimals ; eg .",
    "adachi , hayashi and nakazawa 1976 ) , or as a source of tidal forces ( relevant for bodies @xmath49 0.1 m@xmath3 ; eg .",
    "ward 1997 ) .",
    "the former mechanism will keep the planetesimal disk more dynamically cold , but this does not affect the strength of dynamical friction on larger bodies until @xmath50 .",
    "the latter effect is thought to cause the inward migration of @xmath5 1 - 10 m@xmath3 objects on timescales short compared to their formation times .",
    "this of course constitutes a potentially severe problem not only for our model , but for any model of giant planet formation which requires the accumulation of large solid cores .",
    "addressing this problem is beyond the scope of our present work , but we summarize some reasons why it may in reality have been less severe , in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the 10 m@xmath3 bodies are given a density @xmath51 g/@xmath52 , roughly equal to that of uranus and neptune .",
    "this gives them radii of @xmath53 km .",
    "four such bodies are put in the simulation , initially on nearly circular and uninclined orbits .",
    "the orbits are spaced by 7.5 mutual hill radii , starting from an innermost distance of 6 au to allow for later inward migration by jupiter .",
    "thus the bodies initial semimajor axes are 6.0 au , 7.4 au , 9.0 au and 11.1 au . between @xmath54 and 12 au ,",
    "the disk is depleted in planetesimals so that the surface density is still given by eq .",

    "[ density_set1].,width=480 ]    integrating the surface density from @xmath54 to 12 au , the total mass is 51.5 m@xmath3 . with 40 m@xmath3 of this in the large bodies ,",
    "this leaves 10.5 m@xmath3 in planetesimals in the jupiter - saturn region , in addition to 94.7 m@xmath3 between 12 au , and the outer disk edge at 60 au . in summary , then , the initial conditions amount to a state where phase 2 of giant planet formation has been reached between 5 and 12 au , with @xmath56 of the planetesimals having accreted through oligarchic growth into four bodies of 10 m@xmath3 each , while no large bodies have yet formed beyond this region ( fig .",
    "[ run21_initial_state ] ) .",
    "the adoption of equal - mass protoplanets is a simplification ; apart from stochastic variations among the oligarchic growth endproducts , one can expect some intermediate bodies , with masses perhaps up to a few m@xmath3 .",
    "such bodies are likely to ultimately be cleared , along with the planetesimals , from the giant planet region .",
    "however , they may end up playing a role in the dynamics of the trans - neptunian region ; see petit , morbidelli and valsecchi ( 1999 ) .    for computational reasons ,",
    "the inner simulation radius is chosen as 1 au ; any body whose orbit penetrates this boundary is eliminated from the system .",
    "this is done because a limitation of the symba integrator used here is its inability to handle close perihelion passages .",
    "although a new version of symba has since been developed which removes this restriction ( levison and duncan 2000 ) , the runs presented here predate this development . in any case , this limitation has little relevance for the runs presented here ; typically , less than ten planetesimals are lost at the inner boundary over the course of a 5 myr simulation .",
    "the base timestep is chosen as 0.05 years , giving 20 steps per orbital period for an orbit with its semimajor axis at the inner radius , and over 200 steps per orbit for jupiter .",
    "experimentation shows that this timestep is small enough that the energy of the system is well - conserved .",

    "if the majority of the solids in the asteroid belt accreted to form a system of planet - sized bodies ( raising eccentricities and inclinations of the remaining planetesimals in the process ) , scattered protoplanets crossing into the region may have contributed to making this system unstable , akin to the model of chambers ( 1999 ) . also , if proto - saturn was still sufficiently close to jupiter when it accreted its massive gas envelope , the subsequent migration of the gas giants may have been enough to sweep the inclination - exciting @xmath84 secular resonance through most of the asteroid belt ( cf .",

    "alternatively , a less inclined protoplanet may be able to reproduce the kuiper belt inclinations if it remains on a belt - crossing orbit significantly longer than 1 myr ( and thus longer than in our runs ) .",
    "this may require a less massive trans - saturnian planetesimal disk , in order to increase the dynamical friction timescale , though that in turn would increase the chances of protoplanets being scattered out of the solar system altogether .",
    "a longer circularization time will also result if a protoplanet can be decoupled from jupiter and the other protoplanets at a larger semimajor axis , so that the planetesimal surface density averaged over its orbit is lower . for the latter situation to have a better chance of occurring , the planetesimal disk needs to be extended to larger heliocentric distance .",
    "we will investigate this issue further in future work .",
    "the conventional picture of uranus and neptune s formation , whereby the ice giants accrete near their present heliocentric distances , has grave problems .",

    "building on our previous work ( tdl99 ) , we have performed additional n - body simulations of the evolution of the outer solar system starting at the time when the first gas giant forms . at this point , we assume that a number of @xmath5 10 m@xmath3 objects have formed at a heliocentric distance of roughly 5 to 10 au , as is suggested by the oligarchic growth model ( kokubo & ida 1998 , 2000 ) . using a variety of different initial conditions , we find as before that the accretion of jupiter s gas envelope causes the remaining protoplanets to become violently unstable . in most cases",
    "they are scattered onto high - eccentricity orbits in the trans - saturnian region . with most of its orbit now crossing the largely pristine trans - saturnian planetesimal disk , a scattered protoplanet experiences dynamical friction and",
    "has its eccentricity rapidly damped .",
    "as a result , the protoplanets tend to end up on nearly circular , well - spaced orbits on a myr timescale , with semimajor axes comparable to those of saturn , uranus and neptune . of the simulations which initially contain a total of four giant protoplanets and form jupiter from the innermost ,",
    "the majority produce final orbital configurations similar to that of our outer solar system . such systems are produced  though with lower probability  even if ones adds an extra protoplanet , or lets the second - innermost protoplanet grow into jupiter .",
    "these results strengthen our earlier conclusion that if uranus and neptune shared the same birthplace as the gas giants , they could then readily have been delivered to their present orbits .",
    "the role of migration in the formation of uranus and neptune was previously investigated numerically by ipatov ( 1991 ) , based on an idea by zharkov and kozenko ( 1990 ) .",
    "ipatov concludes that planetary embryos of a few m@xmath3 may have originated just outside the orbit of saturn , to migrate outward and later grow into uranus and neptune , provided that they did not acquire high eccentricities during this process .",
    "in contrast , we find that uranus and neptune could have originated from anywhere in the jupiter - saturn region , and that initially high eccentricities  which nearby bodies naturally tend to acquire during jupiter s final growth phase  are in fact a powerful mechanism for rapidly transporting them outward . also , the long growth timescales in the outer solar system suggest that uranus and neptune likely already completed most of their growth in the jupiter - saturn region ; even with a `` head start '' of a few earth masses , the formation of uranus- and neptune - mass objects much beyond 10 au within the age of the solar system is unlikely ( levison and stewart 2001 , thommes , duncan and levison 2001 )    can one find any observational support for this model in the present - day solar system ?",
    "the high inclinations in the classical kuiper belt point to strong dynamical excitation in the past , and the simulations performed here do produce high inclinations in this region as a natural side effect .",

    "it is tempting to link the trans - neptunian object 2000 cr@xmath106 with a fossilized scattered disk ; its high eccentricity ( 0.8 ) is characteristic of a scattered disk object , but recent observations ( gladman et al 2001 ) have established that its perihelion is at 44 au , far beyond the reach of neptune . however , none of the fossilized disk objects in our simulations acquire semimajor axes as high as that of 2000 cr@xmath106 ( 216 au ) . fig .",

    "feuchtgruber et al ( 1999 ) find that the d / h ratios of the ice giants are lower than those of the oort cloud comets halley ( eberhardt et al 1995 ) , hyakutake ( bockel ' ee - morvan et al . 1998 ) and hale - bopp ( meier et al 1998 ) by a factor of approximately three , a difference large compared to the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "oort cloud comets are thought to have originated primarily in what is today the uranus - neptune region ( duncan , quinn & tremaine 1987 , fernandez 1997 ) , and the notion of a common birthplace is supported by the comets similar d / h ratios .",
    "though a sample size of three is clearly very small , this discrepancy between the comets and the ice giants would seem to present a further problem for any scenario in which uranus and neptune form in the trans - saturnian region , since they should then share the chemical composition of the comets . however , this is exactly what one would expect if the ice giants originally formed at a smaller heliocentric distance , where higher temperatures would have made for a lower d / h ratio .",
    "an aspect not modeled in any of the simulations is the gravitational interaction of the bodies with a gaseous disk .",
    "it has been shown that gas disk tidal forces can cause rapid inward migration of protoplanets ( eg .",
    "ward 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the speed of migration may be peaked for objects of @xmath5 10 m@xmath3 , taking place on timescales of @xmath57 years or less .",
    "this peak corresponds to the transition between so - called type i migration , where a body s resonant interaction with the gas disk gives rise to a torque imbalance , to type ii migration , where the object opens a gap in the gas disk and is subequently locked to the disk s viscous evolution .",
    "tidal migration therefore poses a problem for _ any _ model of giant planet formation : how do they avoid spiralling into the central star as they form ? however , tidal torques may not in fact operate throughout the whole disk .",
    "gammie ( 1996 ) develops an accretion disk model which , beyond @xmath5 0.1 au , only transports angular momentum in a relatively thin surface layer .",
    "thus the bulk of the disk would have zero viscosity , and objects embedded in it would be subject to neither type i nor type ii orbital decay . also , the disk may be truncated early on by photoevaporation from the central star ( shu , johnstone and hollenbach 1993 ) , or from surrounding stars , as is seen in the orion nebula proplyds ( johnstone , hollenbach and bally 1998 ) .",
    "bodies scattered beyond the truncation distance would then be safe from nebula tides , and those near the edge would experience a net positive torque and migrate outward .",
    "of course , such a scenario has the added advantage that , as discussed in the above works , it accounts for uranus and neptune having no massive gas envelopes .    in constructing the simulations presented here , we have appealed to the oligarchic growth model as a plausible guide for our choice of initial protoplanet masses and orbits .",
    "one can of course envision a number of variations .",
    "for instance , two gas giants may form on initially widely separated orbits .",
    "the waves they raise in the disk will tend to clear the gas between them , and type ii migration will cause their orbital separation to decrease ( kley 2000 ) . if ice giant sized bodies are trapped in between , they will be prevented from accreting more gas , and will be scattered as the stable region between the gas giants shrinks to nothing .",
    "also , if future measurements of jupiter constrain its core to be much smaller , or even absent , this will invalidate the assumption that jupiter grew from an ice giant sized nucleus .",
    "though the scattering of ice giants could still take place in principal , one would then need to explain how a small body won the gas accretion race against much larger bodies ( if the core is small ) , or how ice giant sized bodies managed to form before the birth of the first gas giant from an unnucleated disk instability ( if there is no core ; eg .",
    "boss 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , one could search for a way in which accretion could continue to take place in close proximity to a gas giant , with scattering delayed until ice giant sized bodies form .",
    "for such a scenario type i tidal effects , which cause the eccentricity to decay on an even shorter timescale than the semimajor axis ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & larwood 2000 ) , may actually be helpful .",
    "it may then be the dispersal of the gas which triggers scattering . doing away with any reference to a specific formation process ,",
    "the most general statement of our results is : _ ice giant sized bodies can be scattered from the jupiter - saturn region by gas giant sized bodies , to ultimately end up on uranus- and neptune - like orbits . _",

    "<S> the outer giant planets , uranus and neptune , pose a challenge to theories of planet formation . they exist in a region of the solar system where long dynamical timescales and a low primordial density of material would have conspired to make the formation of such large bodies ( @xmath0 and 17 times as massive as the earth , respectively ) very difficult . </S>",
    "<S> previously , we proposed a model which addresses this problem : instead of forming in the trans - saturnian region , uranus and neptune underwent most of their growth among proto - jupiter and -saturn , were scattered outward when jupiter acquired its massive gas envelope , and subsequently evolved toward their present orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of additional numerical simulations , which further demonstrate that the model readily produces analogues to our solar system for a wide range of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this mechanism may partly account for the high orbital inclinations observed in the kuiper belt . </S>"
