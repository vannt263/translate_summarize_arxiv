    "the study of b meson decays has offered a good place to test the standard model ( sm ) and to give some important constraints on the sm parameters .",
    "recently , more attentions have been paid to the @xmath2 decay modes .",
    "the transverse polarization of the vector meson can contribute to the decay width , and the fraction of each kind of polarization has been or will be measured . in some penguin dominated decay modes , such as @xmath3 @xcite , the experimental results for polarization differ from most theoretical predictions @xcite , which has been considered as a puzzle and lots of discussions have been given @xcite .",
    "so the polarization problem in the @xmath2 decay modes brings a new challenge to the standard model , maybe it is a signal of new physics @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will calculate the branching ratio and the polarization fractions of the charmless decay channel @xmath4 with perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite . in this channel",
    ", the initial @xmath5 quark and the light valence @xmath6 quark in the @xmath7 meson do nt appear in the final states , so it must be an annihilation topology in feynman diagrams .",
    "annihilation diagrams ca nt be calculated in factorization approach @xcite or in qcd improved factorization approach @xcite for its endpoint singularity , but in pqcd approach this singularity can be regulated by sudakov form factor and threshold resummation , so the pqcd calculations can give converging results and have prediction power . in this channel , since no tree level operators can contribute , the dominant contribution comes from penguin operators .",
    "the annihilation topology is usually suppressed relative to the emission topology which can appear in other modes , so this channel is a rare decay mode , and hasnt been measured in the @xmath7 factories .    in the next section",
    "we give our theoretical formulae based on the pqcd framework .",
    "then we show the numerical results and a brief conclusion in the third section .",
    "for simplicity , we work in the b meson rest frame , and adopt the light - cone coordinate system",
    ". then the four - momentum of the b meson and the two @xmath8 mesons in the final state can be written as : @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 .",
    "to extract the helicity amplitudes , we should parameterize the polarization vectors .",
    "the longitudinal polarization vector must satisfy the orthogonality and normalization : @xmath12 , and @xmath13",
    ". then we can give the manifest form as follows : @xmath14 as to the transverse polarization vectors , we can choose the simple form : @xmath15    only penguin operators can contribute to this decay channel , so the relevant effective weak hamiltonian can be written as @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are qcd corrected wilson coefficients , and @xmath18 are the usual penguin operators with the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the first four operators are qcd penguin operators ; while the last four are electroweak penguin operators , which should be suppressed by the coupling @xmath21 .",
    "the decay width for this channel is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the 3-momentum of the final state meson , with @xmath24 .",
    "note that for our case an additional factor @xmath25 should appear for the permutation symmetry of the identical final state particles .",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath26 which is decided by qcd dynamics will be calculated later in pqcd approach .",
    "the subscript @xmath27 denotes the helicity states of the two vector mesons with l(t ) standing for the longitudinal ( transverse ) components . after analyzing the lorentz structure ,",
    "the amplitude can be decomposed into @xcite : @xmath28 we can define the longitudinal @xmath29 , transverse @xmath30 helicity amplitudes as @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "after the helicity summation , we can deduce that they satisfy the relation @xmath33    there is another equivalent set of definition of helicity amplitudes @xmath34 with @xmath35 the normalization factor to satisfy @xmath36 where the notations @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 denote the longitudinal , parallel , and perpendicular polarization amplitude .",
    "what is followed is to calculate the matrix elements @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 of various operators in the weak hamiltonian with pqcd approach . in pqcd approach ,",
    "the decay amplitude is factorized into the convolution of the mesons light - cone wave functions , the hard scattering kernel and the wilson coefficients , which stands for the soft , hard and harder dynamics respectively .",
    "the transverse momentum was introduced so that the endpoint singularity which will break the collinear factorization is regulated and the large double logarithm term appears after the integration on the transverse momentum , which is then resummed into the sudakov form factor .",
    "the formalism can be written as : @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath44 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum , which represents the transverse interval of the meson .",
    "@xmath45 is the largest energy scale in hard function @xmath46 , while the jet function @xmath47 comes from the summation of the double logarithms @xmath48 , called threshold resummation @xcite , which becomes large near the endpoint .",
    "the light cone wave functions of mesons are not calculable in principal in pqcd , but they are universal for all the decay channels . so that they can be constraint from the measured other decay channels , like @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays etc . @xcite . for the heavy @xmath7 meson",
    ", we have @xmath51 for the longitudinal polarized @xmath8 meson , @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for transverse polarized @xmath8 meson , @xmath53.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following concepts , we omit the subscript of the @xmath8 meson for simplicity .",
    "= 4.0 in    now the only thing left is the hard part @xmath46 . in pqcd approach , it contains the corresponding four quark operator and the hard gluon connecting the quark pair from sea .",
    "they altogether make an effective six quark interaction .",
    "the hard part @xmath46 is channel dependent , but it is perturbative calculable .",
    "when calculating the hard parts ( shown in the figure 1 ) , the factorizable diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) have strong cancellation effects , which results in null longitudinal polarization contribution and null parallel polarization contribution . the perpendicular polarization survives with a large factorizable contribution , which will be shown later to make a large transverse polarization .",
    "the detailed formulas with polarization @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for each diagram are given in the appendix .",
    "according to pqcd power counting rules , the longitudinal nonfactorizable diagram should give the leading contribution , and the contributions from the other diagrams are suppressed by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "for the @xmath7 meson wave function distribution amplitude in eq.([13 ] ) , we employ the model @xcite @xmath54,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the shape parameter @xmath55gev has been constrained in other decay modes .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath56gev is related to the b decay constant @xmath57gev .",
    "it is one of the two leading twist b meson wave functions ; the other one is power suppressed , so we omit its contribution in the leading power analysis @xcite .",

    "the results for the center value of the branching ratio is then @xmath68 and the helicity amplitudes are given by @xmath69 which shows that the transverse polarization contribution is comparable to the longitudinal one .",
    "the relative strong phases , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are given by @xmath72    now we consider the contribution from different operators .",
    "in the factorizable diagrams , @xmath73 , because of the cancellation between diagrams of figure 1(a ) and 1(b ) . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the qcd penguin operators @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , contribute at the same level . in the nonfactorizable diagrams ,",
    "the operator @xmath78 give the most important contributions .",
    "if we omit the contribution from the electroweak penguin operators , the variation of the contribution from nonfactorizable diagrams ( figure 1(c ) and ( d ) ) is small , while that of the factorizable diagrams ( figure 1(a ) and ( b ) ) is large .",
    "the reason is that the electroweak penguin operator @xmath79 , which has a large wilson coefficient , only presents in the factorizable diagrams .",
    "the overall contribution of electroweak penguin at the branching ratio level is less than @xmath80 .",
    "we also test the contribution without twist-3 wave functions .",
    "we find that if we keep only twist-2 wave functions the total branching ratio does nt change much , but the contribution from the factorizable diagrams will vanish , and the transverse polarization contribution then becomes very small .",
    "so the twist-3 wave functions give very important corrections to the polarization fractions .",
    "there are many theoretical uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "the next to leading order corrections to the hard part is a very important kind of uncertainty for penguin dominant decays . to test it",
    ", we consider the hard scale at a range @xmath81 @xmath82 and other parameters are fixed .",
    "then we can obtain the value area of the branching ratio as @xmath83 which is sensitive to the change of @xmath45 , so the next to leading order corrections will give important contribution .",
    "the ratios @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are also very sensitive to the variation of @xmath45 , because that the nonfactorized contributions decrease as the increasing of t , but the factorizable diagrams , which gives the main contribution of the transverse polarization , increase .",
    "the variety area of @xmath84 is about @xmath87 .",
    "another uncertainty is from the meson wave functions , which is governed by other measured decays @xcite .",
    "the variation of the parameters will also give the corrections , such as the parameter @xmath88 in the @xmath7 wave function , if we assume its value area is @xmath89 , we will give the branching ratio @xmath90 the ratios @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 is not very sensitive to the change of @xmath88 , because it only gives an overall change of branching ratio , not to the individual polarization amplitudes .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the rare decay channel @xmath94 in pqcd approach and give its branching ratio and polarization fractions in sm .",
    "this decay occur purely via annihilation topology , and only penguin operators can contribute .",
    "we predict that it has a very small branching ratio of @xmath1 .",
    "this is so small that it will be sensitive to the new physics , such as supersymmetry etc .",
    "@xcite , which may give a larger branching ratio .",
    "the current experiments only give the upper limit : @xmath95 @xcite , so the more accurate experimental results are needed to test the theory .",
