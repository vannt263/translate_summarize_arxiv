    "recent measurement of @xmath4 production in heavy - ion collisions , expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 , shows interesting dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath1 at various centralities and transverse momenta @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "those properties in @xmath1 are lost when the azimuthal anisotropy is summarized in terms of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the production of ridge in association with triggers has revealing behavior in @xmath6 , the azimuthal angle of the trigger relative to reaction plane , at various centralities @xcite , but those properties are also lost upon integration over all @xmath6 in the determination of the total ridge yield @xcite . in this paper we show that these two phenomena are related , even though @xmath7 ) is a measure of the single - particle distribution , while the ridge yield @xmath8 is a measure of the correlation between trigger and associated particles in specific @xmath5 ranges .    in @xcite the attention",
    "is given mainly to hard processes at high @xmath5 , but it is noted that at low @xmath5 and large @xmath9 around @xmath10 ( the @xmath1 angle relative to the reaction plane ) @xmath3 is nearly constant in @xmath11 . such a curious property calls for an explanation .",
    "a difference in the temperatures along the @xmath12- and @xmath13-directions in the transverse plane has been discussed in the buda - lund model @xcite where @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of a scaling variable that depends on the difference between those temperatures . however , being a hydrodynamical study it does not consider explicitly the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy at low @xmath5 that does not depend on the assumption of rapid thermalization has been investigated in the context of semihard scattering and the ridges that are produced @xcite .",
    "there also @xmath14 is derived without detailed consideration of the @xmath1 variable .",
    "the azimuthal correlation between the ridge and trigger particles has , however , been studied in the correlated emission model ( cem ) @xcite .",
    "it is from that study that we shall find in this paper an explanation of the @xmath1 dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 was introduced originally for the purpose of exhibiting the effect of jet quenching at high @xmath5 , it is actually inappropriate to describe the behavior at low @xmath5 . in the next section",
    "we shall introduce a modified @xmath3 that is more suitable .",
    "the present paper is focused exclusively on @xmath15 gev / c .",
    "it is conventionally thought that at such low @xmath5 only soft physics is involved , a view that has been regarded as being too simplistic on account of the semihard scattering that can enhance the soft thermal partons @xcite . whether or not trigger particles are used to select a subset of events , semihard partons are pervasive and generate ridges that affect both single - particle and dihadron distributions .",
    "that is why we are able to relate the two azimuthal features of the hadronic observables that have been determined by the two rhic experiments @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the azimuthal dependencies of @xmath16 and the ridge yield @xmath8 at midrapidity , where data exist @xcite .",
    "we leave out completely any consideration about longitudinal correlation , on which there is experimental evidence that the ridge particles assoicated with a trigger can be widely separated in rapidity with @xmath17 @xcite , although autocorrelation without trigger shows a ridge with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the physics for longitudinal correlation is very different from that of azimuthal correlation at midrapidity .",
    "we regard them as separate issues to be treated separately , though all basic problems are related at some deep level that we do not address here .",
    "the main content of @xmath19 is the single - particle distribution of @xmath20 collisions , which we abbreviate as @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a shortened notation for the number of participants , @xmath11 . in the following",
    "we shall consider only the production of @xmath24 , since that is what is measured in @xcite with high accuracy .",
    "the properties of @xmath25 are usually presented , especially in hydrodynamical studies , in terms of the @xmath5 spectra ( average of @xmath26 over @xmath1 ) and the elliptical flow coefficient @xmath27 ( second harmonic in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the conceptual basis of flow deemphasizes the role of hard scattering among partons and offers a fluid description of the bulk medium at low @xmath5 . in that description azimuthal anisotropy in non - central collisions",
    "is regarded as the consequence of asymmetric pressure gradient in the transverse plane at early time , assuming fast thermalization . however",
    ", that is not the only approach that can claim physical relevance , although it is the conventional view backed by a large number of investigations based on hydrodynamics @xcite .    an alternative view is to regard semihard scattering near the surface of the nuclear overlap as the driving force of the azimuthal anisotropy , since at low enough virtuality such scattering processes are pervasive throughout the medium , and when they occur near the surface of the almond - shaped initial configuration of the dense system , the semihard partons can emerge from the medium and not only hadronize as intermediate-@xmath5 jets , but also generate ridge particles at lower @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "many issues are involved in the above statement .",
    "first , the fact that semihard scattering can not be calculated reliably in pqcd does not mean that its effects are not important .",
    "second , those effects are sensitive to the geometrical shape of the initial system at early time , since if the parton s transverse momentum is @xmath28 2 - 3 gev / c , the time scale involved is @xmath29 fm / c .",
    "the semihard jets created near the surface give rise to non - trivial @xmath1 dependence of low-@xmath5 partonic distribution independent of the validity of the notion of pressure gradient at @xmath30 fm / c @xcite .",
    "third , those @xmath1-dependent soft partons hadronize and form the ridge structure observed by star whether with trigger @xcite or without trigger @xcite . a theoretical description of the connection between ridges and @xmath2 in the approximation of using a very simple geometrical picture is given in @xcite .",
    "it is along the same line of reasoning , but using a more realistic treatment of the initial geometry , that we relate in this paper all features of @xmath1-dependent observables , namely : @xmath19 , @xmath31 and ridge yield @xmath32 for @xmath33 gev / c .",
    "for hard scattering calculable in pqcd it has been shown that the landau - pomerachuk - migdal interference effect suppresses the radiative energy loss of a hard parton in the initial phase of its trajectory @xcite . applying the inference to semihard partons , despite uncertain validity",
    ", there can be an initial time interval when no energy loss may occur , the consequence of which is that the creation points of the relevant semihard partons can be farther away from the surface .",
    "what count for the ridge formation are those semihard partons that do lose energy on the way out and drive the azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "a shift in the time period when that occurs in the trajectory of a parton in the medium does not alter the relationship we propose between semihard scattering and ridge formation .",
    "an important point to stress in distinguishing our approach from the conventional hydro approach is that the bulk of what is calculated in the latter contains @xmath1 dependence at @xmath33 gev / c and serves as the background of higher @xmath5 hard processes , while the bulk in our approach has no @xmath1 dependence and it is the ridge component at @xmath33 gev / c that gives rise to the @xmath1 dependence of the soft component .",
    "thus we write @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 denoting bulk and ridge , respectively , for @xmath33 gev / c .    at a fixed @xmath37 increases rapidly with @xmath23 , but @xmath19 decreases with @xmath23 except when @xmath38 .",
    "the relationship between them is @xmath39 where the rescaling factor is @xmath40^{-1 } , \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 being the number of binary collisions , short for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the single @xmath24 inclusive distribution in @xmath44 collisions .",
    "this rescaling factor is designed to give @xmath3 a quantitative description of the effect of jet quenching at high @xmath5 .",
    "but at low , which is the region of interest to us in this paper , the more relevant rescaling factor is @xmath45^{-1 } , \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is used instead of @xmath41 because of the dominance of soft processes .",
    "thus we define a different nuclear modification factor @xmath46 from the data on @xmath3 given in @xcite , we can determine @xmath47 .",
    "we illustrate their differences by showing in fig .  1 ( a ) the original @xmath48 and ( b ) the modified @xmath49 , for @xmath1 in the ranges @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 gev / c .",
    "in the following we shall for brevity use @xmath53 and @xmath10 to denote the two angular ranges , although in calculations that involve comparison with data we shall use @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "1(b ) are calculated from the errors on @xmath23 and @xmath41 , neglecting the errors on @xmath3 which are much smaller .",
    "comparison can also be made for @xmath56 gev / c , which we omit here since they are similar to those in fig .  1",
    ". the effective values of the two  ranges will be 1.21 and 1.71 gev / c given numerically in tables in @xcite .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1(a ) that @xmath3 for @xmath53 decreases rapidly with @xmath23 , but @xmath47 in ( b ) is nearly independent of @xmath23 for @xmath57 .",
    "whereas @xmath3 at @xmath58 is nearly constant , @xmath59 increases linearly with @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , these properties of the @xmath23 dependence for @xmath47 are easier to understand , since the elliptical shape of the initial nuclear overlap is relatively independent of the impact parameter @xmath60 when viewed from the broad side at @xmath57 , but becomes narrower as @xmath60 increases , when viewed from @xmath61 where one sees mainly the narrow side of the ellipse .",
    "our problem is to reproduce these properties of @xmath47 quantitatively in a framework where the decomposition of @xmath26 into the two components in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) plays an important role .",
    "as described in @xcite and summarized in the beginning of this section , the azimuthal anisotropy arises from copious semihard scattering near the overlap surface ; the produced semihard partons lose energy to the medium , whose enhanced thermal partons hadronize into the ridge particles that carry the footprint of the initial geometry . the @xmath1 dependence of the ridge distribution @xmath62 is therefore expected to be minimal at large @xmath23 ( small @xmath60 ) , but increases with decreasing @xmath23 , thus opening the gap between @xmath57 and @xmath10 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the recoil semihard partons directed toward the interior of the dense medium are thermalized and retain no memory of the initial geometry by the time they are hadronized ; together with all the other soft processes that occur in the interior they form the bulk that is @xmath1 independent . with @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) being independent of @xmath1 , it is possible to calculate @xmath64 , whose value depends on the relative magnitudes of @xmath65 and @xmath62 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath62 can be related to the ridge yield that depends on the trigger angle @xmath66 in dihadron correlation @xcite .",
    "thus we have a tightly constrained system that restricts the options available to finding a satisfactory physical basis to explain all the relevant experimental features .     and ( b ) modified @xmath47 at fixed  in the range @xmath67 gev / c for @xmath1 in the ranges @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath53 ( in solid circle ) , and @xmath51 , denoted by @xmath58 ( in open squares ) .",
    "the data are from @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to summarize this section , we have described an overall picture in which the @xmath1 and @xmath23 dependencies of @xmath68 are to be related to those of the ridge structure at low @xmath5 . in the following sections we implement this picture with concrete calculations .",
    "the discussion in the preceding section is concerned mainly with the single - particle distribution @xmath25 .",
    "however , ridgeology ( short for ridge phenomenology ) involves two - particle correlation .",
    "let us denote two - pion distribution after background subtraction by @xmath69 where the subscript @xmath70 will for brevity be omitted , since all momenta will hereafter be restricted to the transverse plane with @xmath71 .",
    "we shall use label 1 to refer to the trigger and label 2 to a particle in the ridge .",
    "thus , we have @xmath72 for the correlation angle , not to be confused with the notation in @xcite where @xmath9 denotes the angle of a pion relative to the reaction plane .",
    "when the reaction plane is used as the reference for triggers in correlations ( as will be done in the following ) , then @xmath73 is identified with @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "the dihadron correlation distribution has two components , which are referred to as jet and ridge @xcite , the former being the peak in @xmath74 that sits above the pedestal that is the latter with a wide spread in @xmath74 .",
    "we write them without the arguments as @xmath75 we shall consider only the latter , assuming that in ridgeology the former has been subtracted out from the dihadron correlation function .",
    "the stage is now set for us to discuss the crucial point in our physical basis that relates @xmath76 to the ridge component @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) for the single - particle distribution .",
    "usual ridgeology involves the use of a trigger and measures the momentum of another particle associated with it . for @xmath78 in the range 3 - 4 gev /",
    "c as studied by star in @xcite , the parton that produces the trigger is semihard , i.e. , its transverse momentum is in the intermediate @xmath79 region , @xmath80 gev / c .",
    "phenix uses even lower trigger momentum ( @xmath81 gev / c ) to study the away - side structure @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal properties of the ridge structure as functions of @xmath73 and @xmath82 separately provide significant insight into the correlation between the semihard and the soft thermal partons that does not depend sensitively on the trigger momentum @xcite .",
    "a model on that azimuthal correlation has successfully reproduced the data on the @xmath6 dependence of the ridge yield @xcite ; moreover , a prediction on the asymmetry of the ridge structure in that model ( cem ) has recently been verified by an analysis of the star data @xcite .",
    "the significance of that finding as related to our present problem is that the ridge yield studied in @xcite involves an explicit integration of the @xmath9 distribution of @xmath83 over the ridge angle @xmath82 , while the ridge component @xmath62 in @xmath26 involves an implicit integration of the same over the trigger angle @xmath84 .",
    "a successful description of the correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath82 is therefore a crucial input for the determination of @xmath62 .",
    "an important part of the physics implied in the above is that the direction of the semihard parton that generates the ridge need not be identified by a trigger particle , i.e. , a ridge can exist whether or not there is a trigger .",
    "a ridge particle at @xmath85 can be due to semihard partons at a range of @xmath84 around @xmath85 , so for an inclusive ridge distribution in @xmath85 , the value of @xmath84 should be integrated over , relative to every fixed @xmath85 .",
    "if we omit the arguments @xmath5 and @xmath23 in @xmath62 and identify @xmath86 , then we have @xmath87 where the proportionality factor involves the integration over @xmath78 , which will not be considered explicitly . on the other hand ,",
    "the ridge yield determined in @xcite integrates over all @xmath85 in the range @xmath88 , so we have @xmath89 where the proportionality depends on the number of triggered events in prescribed ranges of @xmath78 and @xmath90 , since @xmath91 is the per - trigger yield .",
    "the effective range of integration in both eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) depends on the correlation width in @xmath92 and is much narrower than 1 rad .",
    "it should now be clear why the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath3 in the phenix data @xcite should in our view be related to the ridgeological study by star @xcite .",
    "there is , however , more complication than just the correlation in @xmath9 .",
    "the dependence on centrality that has not been made explicit in eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) is evident in both @xcite and @xcite . to achieve the correct dependence on @xmath23",
    "requires a careful consideration of the geometry of the problem , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "a summary of this section is that the distribution of ridge particles and the ridge yield are two sides of the same coin , the former being the projection onto @xmath82 of the two - particle distribution @xmath93 , the latter being the projection of the same onto @xmath73 .",
    "the correlation between a semihard parton at @xmath84 and a ridge particle at @xmath85 has been studied in the cem that involves several subprocesses @xcite . ( a )",
    "the semihard parton loses energy to the medium .",
    "( b ) successive radiation by the parton enhances the thermal partons in the vicinity of the trajectory .",
    "( c ) the enhanced thermal partons are carried by local flow to various points on the surface in directions normal to the surface .",
    "( d ) hadronization of those enhanced thermal partons by recombination generates the ridge particles that are centered around the average flow direction .",
    "( e ) density of the ridge is highest when the flow directions are in alignment with the direction of the semihard parton .",
    "( f ) the resultant correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath82 can be described by the convolution of a gaussian distribution in @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is the local flow direction ) with another distribution describing the fluctuation of @xmath85 from @xmath95 . in the midst of all those subprocesses that can not be calculated from first principles ,",
    "there are considerations of nuclear density , points of semihard scattering , emission points along the trajectories , and the exit points at the surface , all of which have been taken into account to the extent possible .",
    "what we can adapt from that study in ridgeology is the central result that there is a correlation @xmath96 ^ 2 \\over 2 \\sigma ^2 } \\right\\ } \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] between the semihard parton direction @xmath73 and the flow direction @xmath97 at the exit point @xmath98 on the surface , with @xmath99 .",
    "the angle between the ridge particle @xmath82 and @xmath95 due to fluctuations has negligible effect on the results .    for every semihard parton direction @xmath73 a variation in the starting point of the trajectory in the nuclear overlap leads to a variation in @xmath97 .",
    "this important property can be turned around and applied to the ridge component of the single - particle distribution . with @xmath82",
    "identified as @xmath95 , for every ridge particle detected at @xmath82 there is a variety of semihard partons in direction @xmath73 that can contribute to that ridge depending on where the exit point @xmath98 is , so long as @xmath100 is within the gaussian width of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the point to stress here is that for @xmath101 in the single - particle distribution in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath1 is @xmath85 and the semihard parton at @xmath73 is undetected and should be integrated over .",
    "the scheme described above can be implemented by concrete calculation because the main input is angular correlation using early time geometry .",
    "hadronization , of course , occurs at late time , and we do not rely on hydrodynamics to describe the evolution of the system in space - time .",
    "our assumption is that the ridge particles in the final state have the same @xmath1 distribution as that of the enhanced thermal partons at early time , which in turn is prescribed by eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the bulk component that has no preferred direction to expand ( not being the same as the hydrodynamical bulk ) is isotopic , and becomes the background of the ridge that carries all the information about the anisotropy of the initial geometry .",
    "when two nuclei of radius @xmath102 collide at impact parameter @xmath60 , the almond - shaped overlap has width and height given , respectively , by @xmath103 where all lengths are normalized by @xmath102 . the appropriate geometry that can best describe the intial configuration almost immediately after impact is the ellipse @xmath104 the flow direction at the surface is normal to that surface , so its azimuthal angle is @xmath105 it should be noted that although we refer to @xmath95 as the flow direction , the use of those words is mainly a compact way to name the direction normal to the surface , as defined in eq .",

    "by the same reasoning , for a fixed @xmath82 the possible semihard partons that can contribute to the corresponding ridge must have their @xmath73 that can deviate from @xmath82 by no more than @xmath107 , as illustrated in fig .",
