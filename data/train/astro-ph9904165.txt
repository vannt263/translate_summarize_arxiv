    "absolute distance measurements in astronomy are extremely valuable and are very difficult to make .",
    "the extragalactic distance scale in particular has profound implications for cosmology , but the distance - ladder methods have generated long - standing controversies .",
    "direct methods of measuring cosmological distances , for example via gravitational lensing effects , offer alternatives to the distance ladder .",
    "one such method exists through combining x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies with the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "this method takes advantage of the fact that the sz effect depends on a different combination of the intrinsic properties of the cluster gas ( density , temperature , physical size ) than the observed x - ray flux : hence the physical size of the cluster , and via the angular size , its distance , can be measured . to see how the distance depends on the measurable quantities , consider a blob of gas of size @xmath3 , electron number density @xmath4 , at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the observed x - ray flux density is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the luminosity distance and @xmath8 is the temperature dependence of the x - ray emissivity ( including gaunt factor ) .",
    "the sz effect from the same gas is @xmath9 if the blob subtends an angle @xmath10 then @xmath11 where the angular size distance @xmath12 . rearranging , @xmath13 where we have dropped the explicit @xmath14 dependence .",
    "@xmath15 can therefore be determined for a cluster of known redshift provided we can measure the gas temperature , the x - ray flux and the sz effect , and provided we can model the distribution of gas in the cluster .",
    "this method ( e.g. cavaliere et al ) was suggested shortly after the sz itself was proposed , and since the first successful detections of the sz effect in the mid-1980s several authors have published determinations of @xmath15 based on it , using both single - dish ( e.g. @xcite ) and interferometric ( e.g. @xcite ) sz measurements . despite the advantages of the sz method in by - passing the entire distance ladder , it does have its own sources of error , which must be carefully addressed .",
    "these include :    1 .",
    "beam switching that does not go fully outside the cluster ; contamination by radio sources in the cluster or ( for single - dish sz measurements ) in the reference beams ; resolving out most of the total flux of the cluster ( for interferometric measurements ) ; poor spatial sampling of the cluster .",
    "2 .   errors in the temperature measurement of the cluster , due to poor photon statistics , temperature substructure and clumping of the cluster gas 3 .",
    "errors due to fitting a simplified smooth model of the gas distribution to a real complicated cluster 4 .   biases due to selection effects in the chosen cluster sample .    in this paper",
    "we describe our analysis techniques for determining @xmath15 by combining sz observations from the ryle telescope  ( rt ) with x - ray data from rosat and asca .",
    "we apply this to data for the cluster a1413 , for which we have previously published sz results @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the various sources of error , both random and systematic , which affect our estimate .",
    "we use our data to measure the hubble constant by creating a numerical model of the temperature and density distributions in a cluster deduced from x - ray data , and then using these to generate mock rt data that can then be compared with real observations .",
    "the gas density is modelled as a king profile in one or three dimensions ( depending on whether the cluster shows significant asphericity ) , and arbitrary temperature profiles can be specified .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , upon which the relative scaling of the x - ray and sz data depend , can be adjusted until both sets of mock data agree with the observations .",
    "the method is essentially similar to those used in other sz measurements of @xmath15 , especially other interferometric measurements @xcite .",
    "unlike reese et al we do not use the sz data to constrain the shape parameters , as the x - ray image contains far more information and would dominate any joint fit ; we do however allow for a non - spherical cluster .      our modelling is based on the analytical king approximation  @xcite for the potential due to a self - gravitating isothermal sphere , which gives results consistent with x - ray images , at least in the inner parts of the gas distribution . the cluster total density @xmath18 at radius @xmath19 from the cluster centre",
    "is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21is the core radius of the cluster .",
    "assuming that the gas density ,  @xmath22 is related to the total mass density by @xmath23 , then @xmath24 the average value of @xmath25 determined by fits to x - ray surface brightness of a large number of clusters is found to be @xmath26 @xcite , but we fit for @xmath25 separately for each cluster .",
    "although we typically use isothermal models for fitting x - ray and sz data , we can vary the temperature to investigate specific effects .",
    "we do not vary the x - ray emissivity constant in these models ; however , for typical rich cluster temperatures ( 710 kev ) this constant is a weak function of temperature when observing in the _ rosat _ 0.52  kev band .",
    "we generate two - dimensional images , of typically @xmath27 pixels , of the model skies in sz and in x - rays .",
    "this results in a spatial resolution in the model of @xmath28  kpc and a total simulation size of @xmath29  mpc  numerical experiments show the results to be insensitive to these parameters .",
    "we can use either a spherical king model ( equation [ kingden ] ) for the density , or a 3-d modification of it in which core radii ( @xmath30 ) are specified in three perpendicular directions , the directions relative to the plane of the sky being specified by three euler angles .",
    "the density at a position ( @xmath31 ) in these coordinates is thus given by @xmath32 we integrate the functions shown below along the rows of a three - dimensional array to generate the sz brightness temperature and x - ray images : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cmb temperature , @xmath38 is the exposure time of the x - ray image and @xmath39 is a telescope , redshift and cluster - temperature dependent constant determining the received count rate , incorporating the bremsstrahlung and line emissivities , hydrogen absorption , detector bandpass and k - correction , expressed as _",
    "rosat _ pspc counts per second due to a volume of @xmath40 of gas , of electron density @xmath41 , at a luminosity distance of @xmath42 mpc .",
    "@xmath43 is the size in metres corresponding to the angular extent of each pixel @xmath44 ; this is calculated using the cluster redshift , @xmath14 , and assumed values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we have checked that we obtain results consistent with the analytic expressions for both the x - ray and sz profiles for the spherical isothermal king model .",
    "we choose not to use the analytic expressions in our code since the approach described above can more easily be modified to allow different distributions of gas density and temperature .",
    "for example , we have been able to investigate the effect of non - isothermal temperature profiles , and also central cooling flow regions .",
    "the latter have no effect on the sz signal , however , since cooling flows are considered to be in pressure equilibrium with the rest of the cluster .",
    "the brightness temperature decrement map is converted to flux density , multiplied by the rt primary beam response , and fast fourier transformed to obtain the simulated aperture - plane response of the rt to the sz decrement .",
    "the best - fit cluster parameters found for the cluster a1413 ( see section  [ a1413xfit ] ) give a profile in the aperture plane for different observing baselines shown in figure  [ pmax ] .",
    "mock data that correspond to the real rt observations can then be generated by sampling this array at the observed coordinates in the aperture plane .",
    "we also simulate the process of observing the sky with the _ rosat _ pspc or hri .",
    "the model x - ray sky is convolved with the x - ray telescope point - spread function , and a suitable background level added . for making model",
    "fits a smooth background is used ; we can also make images in which each pixel value ( signal plus background ) is replaced with a sample from a poisson distribution of the same mean , thus generating realistic x - ray images .",
    "we tested the program to ensure that it gave the expected dependence upon central number density , @xmath25 , core radius , gas temperature and value for @xmath15 and to check that the results for the simulations were not dependent upon pixel size or overall array size .",
    "we have predicted the effect that changes in various cluster parameters would have on our rt observations .",
    "in particular we were concerned about the behaviour of the flux density measured on the shortest rt baselines , since these are the most sensitive to the sz effect .",
    "( the shortest physical rt baseline is @xmath45 , but at for lower declinations this can be projected down to a minimum of the antenna diameter of @xmath46 . ) the results here were obtained using the model parameters for abell  1413 , but are typical of all the rich clusters we observe .    we simulated a cluster with using the best - fit parameters that we have found for a1413 ( see section  [ a1413xfit ] ) but varied the core radius .",
    "we found that the central decrement is directly proportional to the core radius , as expected , and that the flux density measured on the 870  @xmath47 baseline quickly began to flatten off ( see figure [ flxvrad ] ) as the rt starts to resolve out the sz signal .",
    "this resolving out starts to become significant for core radii of greater than about 70  arcseconds for the 870  @xmath47 baselines .    in a further test",
    "we varied the central number density , @xmath48 , for various core radii to give the same observed flux density using a @xmath49 baseline , and recorded the central temperature decrement that these models would give .",
    "the results are also shown in figure  [ flxvrad ] .",
    "the central decrement does not vary greatly with core radius , especially around 60  arcseconds which is the expected size for a cluster with core radius of about 200  kpc at moderate redshift .",
    "we have also assessed the effects of redshift and cosmology on the sz signal seen .",
    "we simulated observations of clusters with the same intrinsic parameters lying at different redshifts .",
    "first we calculated the clusters angular core radii , corresponding to a constant physical radius of 250  kpc , assuming einstein - de sitter ( @xmath50 ) and milne ( @xmath51 ) cosmologies .",
    "the results for observations with baselines of 870 and 1740  @xmath47 are shown in figure  [ flx900 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the rt has similar sensitivity to a cluster at redshifts between 0.2 and 10 on the shortest baseline in both cosmologies .",
    "on the 1740  @xmath47 baseline the signal peaks for clusters at redshifts between 0.3 and 4 in an einstein - de sitter cosmology , but tends to a maximum value in a milne universe beyond a redshift of 1 .",
    "we therefore conclude that observations of the sz effect with the rt should be possible for clusters at any redshift from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "although the sz effect predicted to be detected by the rt from a cluster of given physical size is largely independent of cosmology , the value of @xmath15 that we will calculate from observations will be affected by the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 that we adopt .",
    "the true value of @xmath15 and the calculated value @xmath54 will be related by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the calculated and true angular distances to the cluster respectively .",
    "the correction factor @xmath58 is shown in figure  [ q0corr ] .",
    "since _ rosat _ x - ray images contain far more information about the gas distribution in a cluster than rt sz data , we use the x - ray image to model the density distribution .",
    "we assume the cluster is a triaxial ellipsoid with two principal axes in the plane of the sky , and with the core radius along the line of sight equal to the geometric mean of the other two core radii .",
    "we then use a downhill simplex fitting method , implemented by the routine amoeba  @xcite , to optimise the central density , core radii , ellipsoid centre , position angle and @xmath25 parameter .",
    "the likelihoods of the data given the model are calculated as the product of the poisson likelihoods of obtaining the observed count at each pixel in the x - ray image , given the parameters .",
    "it is necessary to use the poisson statistic rather than @xmath59 in order to avoid biases in the regions of low count rate where the two statistics differ significantly .",
    "this method also allows arbitrary regions to be excluded from the fit ; this is used for example to exclude point sources in the x - ray image .",
    "we use vignetting - corrected x - ray images ( i.e. divided by the image of effective exposure time ) for the fitting .",
    "although this results in a distortion of the photon statistics across the map ( partly due to the presence of the non - vignetted instrumental background ) , this effect is small in the central part of the image where all the cluster signal lies .",
    "we also use images that are binned so as to under - sample the psf ( pixel size equal to fwhm of psf ) so that the position dependence of the psf is negligible over the region of interest .",
    "there is a degeneracy between @xmath25 and @xmath60 , and @xmath48 , in that almost equally good fits can be obtained by changing the value of @xmath25 , and re - fitting for @xmath60 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , although the resulting value of the central temperature decrement is changed for these different fits , the flux density observed by the interferometer is almost unchanged .",
    "this is because the observed flux density depends on both the central decrement and the shape of the cluster , and on our most sensitive baselines the two effects almost cancel .",
    "the effect of this can be seen in figure  [ degenerate ] , which shows contours of likelihood of the x - ray fit in the @xmath25@xmath60 plane overlaid with contours of the predicted flux density observed by the rt .",
    "the flux density contours ( which are used to calculate @xmath15 ) lie parallel to the @xmath25@xmath60 degeneracy , which thus has little effect on the value of @xmath15 found .",
    "reese et al .",
    "find a similar result for the ovro / bima arrays .",
    "interferometers measure the fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution at discrete points defined by the orientation of the baselines , with independent noise values at each point .",
    "inverting the data to form an image results in both signal and noise being convolved with the fourier transform of the sampling function ( the synthesised beam ) , resulting in long - range correlations across the map . with well - filled apertures and high signal - to - noise ,",
    "this is not a problem . since the rt has few baselines on which the sz effect is detectable , these correlations are significant , ie the synthesised beam has large far - out sidelobes .",
    "it is therefore very difficult to do meaningful fitting to the data in the image plane .",
    "accordingly , we fit our data to models in the aperture plane , although we also make maps , particularly in order to identify positive sources in the field .",
    "once a fit has been made to the x - ray image using an assumed value of @xmath15 , an sz sky model and simulated rt aperture are generated as described above .",
    "variations in @xmath15 result in a simple scaling of the amplitude of the sz signal .",
    "the calibrated , source - subtracted rt visibility data are read in and a @xmath59 statistic calculated between the real and mock data as a function of amplitude scaling ; we multiply by a prior that is uniform in log space ( since @xmath15 is a scale parameter ) to find the peak and extent of the posterior probability distribution .",
    "a1413 , at a redshift @xmath61 , is a massive and highly luminous cluster with a _",
    "rosat_-band luminosity of @xmath62 w @xcite .",
    "we have previously published sz data on the cluster abell  1413 @xcite but did not derive an @xmath15 value there due to the significant ellipticity of the cluster and the presence of a moderate cooling flow , both of which complicate the process . here",
    "we calculate @xmath15 from a1413 taking both these effects into consideration . as well as our rt sz data",
    ", we use an observation made with the _ rosat _ pspc , and a temperature derived from _ rosat _",
    "hri and _ asca _ data .",
    "we fitted an ellipsoidal model ( as described in section [ x - fitting ] ) to the _ rosat _ pspc image observed on 1991 november 27 , which has an effective exposure of 7696  s. we use only the hard ( 0.52  kev ) data in order to minimise the effect of galactic absorption ; the image is shown in figure  [ a1413 - 0 - 1 ] , along with the rt sz image .",
    "allen et al .   find that a1413 has a cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of 200 m@xmath63 within a radius of 200 kpc of the centre , and that the temperature in this region is depressed by some 20% from the value in the outer regions .",
    "therefore we excluded the x - ray data within the cooling flow radius from our analysis , along with several x - ray point sources which appear in the image .",
    "keeping the cooling flow region in the fit would result in a more compact model ( higher @xmath25 , smaller core radius ) that would not reflect the true distribution of the gas , most of which is outside the cooling flow .",
    "allen and fabian use _ asca _ and _ rosat _ hri data to determine the temperature of a1413 in two models ; one assuming the gas is isothermal , and one also fitting for a cool component , with the fraction of the total emission from the cool gas normalised by the fitted mass deposition rate of the cooling flow .",
    "these methods yield @xmath64 kev and @xmath65  kev respectively ( 90% confidence errors ) .",
    "the latter value is a better estimate of the temperature of the bulk of the cluster gas , outside the cooling flow region .",
    "since we have excluded the cooling flow region from our fit to the surface brightness image , we use this higher temperature as the more consistent model .",
    "the value of @xmath15 that would be obtained from using the cooler temperature can be found from the scaling given in section [ theanswer ] .",
    "the x - ray emissivity constant was calculated assuming an absorbing h column of @xmath66 m@xmath67 , a metallicity of 0.3 solar and a temperature of 8.5  kev , giving a value of @xmath68 @xmath69 from 1  m@xmath70 of gas of electron density 1  m@xmath71 at a luminosity distance of 1  mpc .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters were @xmath72 , core radii of  @xmath73 and @xmath74 with a position angle of the major axis of @xmath75 and a central density @xmath76 ( assuming a core radius in the line of sight of @xmath77 arcsec ) , where @xmath78 .",
    "these parameters agree well with the fit by allen et al .",
    "the _ rosat _ image , our x - ray model and a map of the residuals are shown in figure  [ residuals ] .",
    "the residual map has zero mean in the regions included in the fitting , although the excess flux in the cooling - flow region and a point source stand out .",
    "the poisson noise also rises towards the centre of the cluster as the square root of the signal level .",
    "the reduced value of @xmath59 for this fit is 1.02 ; the mean log likelihood over the region of the fit is @xmath79 , and the expected distribution of @xmath43 , as discussed in grainge et al .",
    ", is @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the fit is a good one .",
    "there is a degeneracy between @xmath25 and the core radii ( see section  [ x - fitting ] ) which lies parallel to lines of constant predicted flux density observed by the rt .",
    "figure  [ degenerate ] shows that acceptable fits to the x - ray map correspond to uncertainties in the predicted sz flux density of @xmath81jy and @xmath82jy at 67% and 95% confidence .",
    "therefore we estimate that the error in @xmath15 that arises solely from our x - ray fitting procedure is @xmath83 .",
    "the formula for the sz effect quoted above ( eqn  [ szeffect ] ) uses non - relativistic approximations , which become more significant at higher gas temperatures and higher observing frequency .",
    "challinor and lasenby show that a better approximation in the rayleigh - jeans region ( correct to second order in @xmath5 ) is @xmath84 for a1413 this correction amounts to some 2.5% , and we use the corrected value in the results below .",
    "the sz data used were those described by grainge et al , who also describe the procedure for subtracting the effects of radio sources within the field .",
    "we used only the visibilities from the rt baselines shorter than 2 k@xmath47 for the fitting , since the sz effect is completely resolved out on longer baselines .",
    "the mock data based on our x - ray model were compared with the source - subtracted data from our observations to find best - fit values of @xmath15 and the corresponding value of @xmath48 ; these were @xmath15 = @xmath85  @xmath1 and @xmath86  @xmath87 ( for an einstein - de sitter universe and apply the correction for primary flux calibration discussed in section  [ prim ] ) .",
    "a plot of the posterior probability distribution is shown in figure  [ likelihood ] .",
    "the central sz temperature decrement in this model is  @xmath88k .",
    "the quoted ( 1-@xmath89 ) error on @xmath15 is just that due to the noise on the sz data and the fitting to the x - ray image ; other sources of error are discussed below .",
    "there are other sources of error which may affect our estimate of @xmath15 .",
    "these arise in the radio observations , in the x - ray data , and in the modelling process .",
    "the rt is primary flux - calibrated every day on either 3c  48 or 3c  286 , assumed to have flux densities in the observed stokes parameter _",
    "i_+_q _ of 1.70 and 3.50  jy respectively .",
    "these fluxes are derived from baars et al . .",
    "we estimate that the daily random error in primary calibration is @xmath90 .",
    "since the total integration time on a1413 is 65  days , the overall error in primary calibration due to variation during each day is @xmath91 .",
    "since the calculated value of @xmath15 is proportional to the square of the measured sz flux , this leads to an error of @xmath92 in @xmath15 .",
    "measurements by the vla in ` d ' configuration have shown that the flux densities of both 3c  48 and 3c  286 show slight variations with time @xcite . this time variability is small , less than @xmath90 . measurements in 1995 , roughly contemporary with our observations , showed that the true flux density of 3c48 was 3.4% lower than the baars et al value , while that of 3c286 was 1.2% higher .",
    "since roughly equal numbers of the individual rt observations of a1413 were calibrated from each source , we average the errors and take the likely systematic error as @xmath93% .",
    "this results in a reduction in @xmath15 of 2.2% , and a further error term of @xmath94% .",
    "we removed the effect of contaminating radio sources using higher resolution data from both the longer baselines of the rt and from vla imaging of the field .",
    "however , the accuracy to which the sources can be removed depends on the level of uncalibrated amplitude and phase errors in the rt . from maps of secondary calibrator sources",
    "we have found that the dynamic range of the rt is typically 100:1 . since the total flux density of the six sources removed from the a1413 data is 3.1  mjy , the maximum spurious flux remaining after source subtraction will be @xmath95jy .",
    "however , taking into account the distribution of the sources on the sky and the contribution each makes at the position of the sz decrement , we find that the maximum unsubtracted contribution of the detected sources is only @xmath96jy .",
    "however , a more significant contribution is from the sources which were not subtracted due to their being too faint to detect . to calculate the confusion noise contribution from unsubtracted sources ,",
    "we take the @xmath97ghz @xmath98jy source counts of windhorst et al , and extrapolate to 15  ghz using an effective spectral index calculated from their 58.4  ghz spectral measurements . integrating the source counts over the beam area corresponding to our shortest baseline , from zero flux density up to our source detection limit of @xmath99jy , and taking into account the increased source population in clusters compared to the field @xcite",
    ", we find a residual confusion noise of @xmath100jy , which adds in quadrature with the thermal noise .",
    "however , since we estimate our thermal noise from the scatter in the visibilities , the confusion noise is already included in our noise estimate , and does not need to be added in again .",
    "the x - ray emission constant , @xmath39 , used in simulating the x - ray data is dependent upon the telescope detector response in the appropriate frequency band , the k - correction for redshift , the cluster temperature and the absorption due to galactic hydrogen .",
    "we estimate that this constant could be in error by @xmath101 leading to a @xmath101 error in @xmath15 .",
    "some clusters of galaxies are known to have diffuse ( ` halo ' ) emission on arcminute scales .",
    "any such emission at 15  ghz would be resolved out on the longer rt baselines used for source subtraction , and would therefore contaminate the sz data .",
    "observations at 1.4  ghz from the nvss and first surveys show that there is 1.9  mjy of flux associated with the central cluster galaxy which is extended on scales of @xmath102 , but none on larger scales .",
    "this source was detected ( and indeed slightly resolved ) in the rt longer baselines and was removed from the data ( source 3 in grainge et al ) .",
    "the spectral index of this source @xmath103 is 0.8 , typical for a cluster galaxy but quite atypical for a diffuse halo source , where one would expect @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "also , halo emission is unknown in clusters with strong cooling flows such as a1413 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no evidence for any unsubtracted diffuse emission in a1413 .",
    "the temperature we use has a quoted 90% confidence error of @xmath105 .",
    "converting this to a 1-@xmath89 errors for consistency gives @xmath106 , which will lead to a @xmath107 error in @xmath15 .",
    "x - ray images of clusters show that clusters are typically elliptical with ellipticities of up to 1.2:1 being common .",
    "therefore one cluster is not sufficient to provide a definitive value of @xmath15 . making the necessary corrections to equation [ calch0 ]",
    ", one finds that the calculated value @xmath108 is related to the true value by : @xmath109 for a cluster with line - of - sight depth @xmath110 and observed diameter @xmath111 . therefore the derived @xmath15 from a sample where there is no bias in the orientation of clusters will form a distribution with a geometric mean close to the true value .",
    "it is thus necessary to observe such a sample of clusters in order to reduce the uncertainty due to this effect .",
    "an x - ray surface - brightness limited sample will be biased towards selecting clusters elongated towards us",
    ". however , an x - ray sample selected on x - ray flux will be independent of cluster orientation .    in a case such as the present where one is estimating @xmath15 from a _ single _ cluster , it is appropriate to make some allowance for orientation uncertainty .",
    "for a1413 we have assumed that the line - of - sight depth through the cluster is the mean of the two elliptical axes in the plane of the sky .",
    "this is an unbiased estimator of the true depth , assuming the cluster is drawn from an unbiased population  @xcite .",
    "( sulkanen finds a similar result taking the arithmetic mean . ) in order to estimate the error introduced by this assumption we compare model distributions of elliptical clusters with those observed in a sample of rosat - selected clusters over a redshift range of @xmath520.5 .",
    "we find that the effect of cluster ellipticity adds an error of @xmath112 for each cluster to the calculated value of @xmath15 .",
    "considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium , as well as observations on nearby clusters @xcite show that the isothermal assumption breaks down at radii much bigger than @xmath21 , the temperature falling by a factor of about 2 at @xmath113 .",
    "this can in principle have a significant effect on the derived value of @xmath15 , tending to bias it downwards @xcite . for a1413 , one core diameter corresponds to 2 arcminutes , which is approximately the scale to which the rt is sensitive .",
    "gas on larger scales than this does not affect the flux density seen by the rt , despite the effect it has on the sz central decrement .",
    "_ asca _ observations do encompass larger scales , but the temperature measurement is necessarily emission - weighted , and hence is a good measurement of the temperature of the gas that the rt sees .",
    "we therefore conclude that sz observations by the rt are not going to be significantly affected by the presence of a cold halo of gas , and so we can calculate @xmath15 without requiring knowledge of the gas temperature at large radii .",
    "a future paper will deal with this effect in more detail .",
    "x - ray imaging on nearby , large angular size clusters has found no evidence for clumping , and has placed constraints on the degree of clumping which may be present  @xcite .",
    "however it has been suggested that the scatter in the temperature  luminosity correlation for clusters is due to the existence of clumping below this level and further that the degree of clumping is correlated with the strength of the cooling flow @xcite .",
    "if the clumps are close to being in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings the clumping will have no effect on the sz signal .",
    "the x - ray luminosity will increase but the effect of this in the @xmath15 estimate will largely be cancelled due to the decreased emission - weighted temperature . the net result would be a modest underestimate of @xmath15 .",
    "initial simulations indicate that fractionation leading to an underestimate of @xmath114 in @xmath15 would be consistent with the temperatures calculated by allen and fabian  .",

    ", a cluster with a peculiar velocity of 265  km  @xmath117 will have a kinetic sz effect with a magnitude @xmath118 of that due to the thermal sz effect and so introduce a @xmath90 error in the determination of @xmath15 from a single cluster .",
    "since randomly selected clusters will have random directions of peculiar motion , the error introduced into @xmath15 calculations can be reduced by averaging over a large sample of clusters .",
    "it is possible that the electron cluster gas could emit sufficient thermal bremsstrahlung radiation at 15  ghz to significantly affect the sz decrement which we observe .",
    "we calculated the emissivity of the hot thermal component of the gas using our cluster model , taking the gaunt factor to be 10 at a frequency of 15  ghz .",
    "we find that the total integrated flux density from the entire cluster is @xmath119jy .",
    "this emission will be distributed like the x - ray emission , and the resolving - out of our shortest baseline means that we will observe only about 20% of it . since the emissivity due to bremsstrahlung is proportional to @xmath120 , it is possible that the effect of thermal bremsstrahlung will be much greater in a cluster which has a strong cooling flow and thus a high gas density at the cluster centre @xcite .",
    "we investigated this possibility by using a good empirical fit to the form of a cooling flow , determined from x - ray observations , allowing the density to increase as @xmath121 for @xmath19 within the cooling flow radius of 100200  kpc until @xmath122  kpc .",
    "we find that this cooling flow contributes a further @xmath123jy of flux density .",
    "therefore we conclude that even for this worst case example , and assuming that none of the cooling - flow flux is resolved out by the rt , the effect of thermal bremsstrahlung will be to overestimate @xmath15 by up to @xmath114 .",

    "this error may be reduced by observing a complete sample of randomly - oriented clusters .",
    "a colder cluster atmosphere at large radius will not affect our determination of @xmath15 much , but clumps of cool gas within the cluster may result in an underestimate the value of @xmath15 of up to 2% . 6 .   the kinetic sz effect will cause a random uncertainty of approximately 2.5% the value of the thermal sz effect",
