    "<S> we investigate non - linear schrdinger - type formulation of cosmology of which our cosmological system is a general relativistic frlw universe containing canonical scalar field under arbitrary potential and a barotropic fluid with arbitrary spatial curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the formulation to include phantom field case and we have found that schrdinger wave function in this formulation is generally non - normalizable . assuming power - law expansion , @xmath0 , we obtain scalar field potential as function of time . the corresponding quantities in schrdinger - type formulation such as schrdinger total energy , schrdinger potential and wave function are also presented . </S>"
