    "the galactic bulge is major component of the milky way ( mw ) galaxy , morphologically distinct from the disk and halo , composed of mostly old stars with an embedded bar .",
    "it is the closest bulge and bar to us and we can study it in greater detail than for any other galaxy , down to individual stars . not only does the mw bulge provide a way to understand bulges and bars in extra - galactic spiral galaxies , but its population is similar to distant giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "we would , naturally , like to know how the bulge came to be : how did it evolve ? because the chemical element abundance patterns contain a fossil record of past star formation , much could be learned from a study of the bulge chemical composition . however , an impediment to reading this fossil record is that we do not fully understand the nucleogenesis of all the elements .",
    "thus , we must try to simultaneously understand both the mechanisms and astrophysical sites of element synthesis as well as the star formation history of the bulge .    because the bulge is situated in a deep gravitational well , compared to the mw disk and halo , and because its stars seem to be mostly old , chemical evolution occurred under different environmental conditions in the bulge .",
    "thus , a comparison of the bulge chemical properties , to those in other locations , offers a way to understand how environment can affect chemical evolution .",
    "this should inform us about the sites of nucleosynthesis and clues to how the bulge evolved .",
    "certainly , the chemical evolution models , developed to explain the composition of stars near the sun , should work everywhere .    to address these questions and issues",
    "we must first measure the bulge s chemical properties ; good measurements are the basis for understanding .",
    "once we have good measurements we need to compare them to something .",
    "it would be nice to compare with the output of chemical evolution models , but at the present time it is more informative to compare to other chemically evolving systems . here",
    ", we compare the bulge chemical composition with the milky way thin and thick disks , and then ask how the evolution of these systems could have produced the measured composition differences .",
    "the idea that the chemical composition of the galaxy has evolved over time sprang from the identification of metal - poor stars by chamberlain & aller ( 1951 ) and the theoretical predictions of hoyle ( 1946 ) , who proposed that element synthesis occurred in stars and supernova explosions .",
    "the simple model of chemical enrichment ( e.g. , schmidt 1959 ; searle & sargent 1972 ) assumed zero metal starting point , gas in a closed box , consumed by multiple generations of star formation ; each generation locked - up some gas in the form of low - mass stars and returned gas enriched in metals from massive stars .",
    "the return of metals was assumed to occur instantaneously and the interstellar gas immediately homogenized .    upon complete consumption of the gas in this model , the metallicity distribution function ( henceforth mdf ) has a predictable mean and standard deviation . in particular , the mean metallicity of the final mdf is equal to the ratio of the mass of metals produced to mass of gas locked - up in dwarf stars per generation ; this parameter is called the _ yield _",
    "( searle & sargent 1972 ) . for systems that lose gas or metal - rich ejecta",
    "the yield is lowered ; for systems that over - produce low - mass stars the yield is also lowered , while for systems that under - produce low - mass stars or over - produce high mass stars , the yield is increased . in such situations we often refer to the _ effective yield_. early comparison of the mdf predicted from the simple model with metallicity measurements of g - dwarf stars ( e.g. , schmidt 1963 ) showed that the milky way disk has fewer metal - poor stars than expected ; this lacuna was called `` the g - dwarf problem '' .",
    "g - dwarf problem _ is thought to be due to infall of fresh material ( e.g. larson 1972 ; pagel 1989 ) during the chemical evolution of the mw disk .",
    "the simple model provides a tight age - metallicity relation , linear for a constant star formation rate , which occurs when not much of the gas has been consumed .",
    "the factor of two enhancement in [ x / fe ] for even - numbered light elements in metal - poor stars of the galactic halo , has been known for over 50 years ( e.g. , wallerstein et al .",
    "1962 , 1963 ; conti et al .",
    "initially , it was thought that these elements ( e.g. , o , mg , si , s , ca , ti ) were produced in the @xmath5-process , suggested by burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) , by successive addition of @xmath5 particles .",
    "although alpha - capture in massive stars accounts for @xmath8o and some @xmath9 mg , the remaining @xmath9 mg is produced by carbon burning , while si , s , and ca are thought to be produced during explosive oxygen burning in core - collapse snii events ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 , abbreviated ww95 ) .",
    "thus , `` alpha element '' is not a very appropriate name .",
    "tinsley ( 1979 ) suggested that the observed decline of the [ o / fe ] ratio with increasing [ fe / h ] ( from halo to disk ) was due to the delayed addition of iron from type  ia supernovae ( henceforth snia ) , whose progenitors are @xmath108m@xmath11 , to an oxygen - rich composition produced by more massive stars .",
    "these massive stars end as core - collapse supernovae ( henceforth snii ) with o / fe yields that increase with progenitor mass ( e.g. ww95 ) .",
    "a small , but useful , idea is that the frequency of snia declines with delay time roughly 1/@xmath12 ; most snia occur promptly , in less than 2gyr , with a long tail out to 10gyr ( see maoz et al .",
    "2010 ; greggio et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "matteucci & brocato ( 1990 , henceforth mb90 ) produced a marvellous sketch of the expected [ o / fe ] trend with [ fe / h ] for stellar systems with different star formation rates ( henceforth sfr ) . since infall time scales with 1/@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass density , dense systems collapse more quickly and have a higher sfr than low - density or loose systems .",
    "thus at high sfr , expected for bulges and giant elliptical galaxies , mb90 predicted that [ o / fe ] remains high to much higher [ fe / h ] than than low sfr systems like the solar vicinity or dwarf galaxies .",
    "this idea of mb90 provides a useful prediction for the composition of the galactic bulge , that can constrain the bulge sfr and formation timescale .",
    "figure  [ fig - mb90 ] shows a representation of the mb90 [ o / fe ] prediction , and also the sense of the effect due to increased fraction of massive stars .",
    "remarkably , the low [ o / fe ] ratios predicted by mb90 for dwarf galaxies is verified ( e.g. , shetrone et al . 2001 , 2003 ) , although some dwarf galaxies show low [ o / fe ] due to imf modification ( e.g. mcwilliam , wallerstein & mottini 2013 ) .     with [ fe / h ]",
    "depends on the sfr : high sfr systems , like bulges and elliptical galaxies , should show enhanced [ o / fe ] to high [ fe / h ] , while the low sfr dwarf galaxies show reduced [ o / fe ] relative to the solar vicinity .",
    "also shown is the direction of the [ o / fe ] plateau with an enhanced fraction of massive stars , marked as imf , which over - produce oxygen .",
    ", width=288 ]    these simple ideas provide a framework for understanding evolution of the galactic bulge , compared to the solar neighborhood , by the study of the detailed chemical composition .",
    "we may hope to learn how much time it took chemical evolution to build the bulge and what the star formation rate was .",
    "we may also learn whether , or not , the initial mass function ( henceforth imf ; salpeter 1955 ) of stars in the bulge was like that in the solar vicinity .",
    "while such detailed abundance ratios may elucidate the chemical evolution history of the bulge , and provide a test for these ideas , abundance ratios in the bulge can be used to constrain the sites of nucleosynthesis of various elements , whose origin is uncertain .",

    "( 2014 ) , is summarized in figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] , revealing a situation much more complex than initially considered .",
    "most of the results were previously seen by reddy et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) and bensby et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] shows kinematic identifications , at p@xmath790% , for the halo , thick disk and thin disk .",
    "there is a large dispersion in [ @xmath5/fe ] for halo stars at a given [ fe / h ] , probably due to different snii / snia ratios of accreted dwarf galaxies .",
    "the stars identified as thick disk have larger [ @xmath5/fe ] than the thin disk , declining with increasing [ fe / h ] , but near [ fe / h]=@xmath40.2 dex the thick disk [ @xmath5/fe ] declines sharply and merges with the thin disk .",
    "these low [ @xmath5/fe ] thick disk stars could well be mis - identified thin disk stars , or simply thin disk stars that suffered kinematic heating to thick disk velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] shows a number of intriguing sub - populations .",
    "for example , the @xmath5-enhanced metal - poor stars with thin disk kinematics could be thick disk stars mis - identified as thin disk .",
    "however , they may simply be old , @xmath5-enhanced , stars but with thin disk kinematics .",
    "if this is true , a more accurate name for the thick disk might be the `` early disk '' or  old disk.    another unusual sub - population in figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] includes stars identified with thick disk kinematics , but showing low [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios , similar to most thin disk stars .",
    "while these stars may simply be mis - identified thin disk stars , taken at face value it is possible that they reflect the composition of the late thick disk ; this might occur in a prolonged evolution of the thick disk , where there was sufficient time to permit late snia ejecta to be included in the chemical enrichment .",
    "such a slow - down of thick disk chemical enrichment might be expected after the main mdf peak , by which time a significant fraction of gas had been lost .",
    "another possibility is that these stars formed in the thin disk , but later experienced gravitational interactions that resulted in increased vertical scale heights and kinematics similar to the thick disk . finally , the most interesting sub - population in figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] include the kinematically identified thin disk stars with slightly sub - solar [ fe / h ] , which seem to extrapolate the alpha - enhanced thick disk trend , from lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "these stars can not be explained by mis - identification and composition measurement error seems highly unlikely .",
    "the chemical similarity to the bulge suggests that these stars might be due to radial migration of low - vertical scale height stars from the inner thick disk or bulge .",
    "if these stars have not migrated from inner regions , but are related to the local thick disk , their thin disk kinematics suggests low vertical scale heights and , thus , a vertical metallicity gradient in the thick disk ; this may have occurred shortly after the time when thick disk molecular clouds relaxed into thin disk kinematics .",
    "other scenarios , some heretical , may also explain this unusual sub - population of stars .",
    "it appears as if there are two modes of chemical enrichment in the mw disk that are not strictly confined to kinematic sub - populations : the metal - poor @xmath5-rich mostly thick disk trend and the metal - rich , low-@xmath5 mostly thin disk trend .",
    "the two populations both show [ @xmath5/fe ] decline with increasing [ fe / h ] suggesting the delayed addition of snia iron .",
    "another inconsistency with simplistic ideas of chemical enrichment , seen in bensby et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , is the relatively large dispersion in the age  metallicity relation .",
    "while metal - rich disk stars are mostly young , older metal - poor stars cover a large full range of [ fe / h ] in both mw disks ; the tight age - metallicity relations predicted by the simple model is not evident .    for more detailed discussions of chemical evolution see pagel ( 1997 ) and matteucci ( 2012 ) .",
    "the presence of both rr lyrae stars and m giant stars in the galactic bulge indicate a large metallicity range , from halo metallicities up to at least the solar value ( e.g. , baade 1946 ; nassau & blanco 1958 ) .",
    "strictly , the word `` metallicity '' refers to the mass fraction of metals ( elements heavier than he ) , represented as _",
    "z_. however , in modern times the abundance of iron relative to the sun , [ fe / h ] , has been used , interchangeably , with the word `` metallicity '' .",
    "the connection is that in order to compute the metallicity , _ z _ , one must scale the solar abundance distribution by a reference element , typically iron , which is easily measured . here , i will use an imprecise meaning of the word , generally correlated with overall z or [ fe / h ] .",
    "the seminal work of rich ( 1988 ) provided the first metallicity estimate for the bulge from low - resolution stellar spectra of 88 bulge k giants in baade s window , at _",
    "b_=@xmath43.9@xmath15 ; he found a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath20.3 dex ; 1@xmath16 measurement uncertainties were 0.20 dex .",
    "this was not a model atmosphere abundance analysis , but rather a correlation of the equivalent widths ( henceforth ews ) of prominent fe , mg and na optical features versus ( j@xmath4k ) color , calibrated against high - resolution model atmosphere abundance results from solar neighborhood stars .",
    "terndrup ( 1988 ) used bvi photometry to estimate the bulge metallicity , at latitudes ranging from @xmath44@xmath15 to @xmath410@xmath15 , that relied upon color - metallicity calibrations from detailed abundance analyses of solar neighborhood stars .",
    "terndrup claimed mean solar [ fe / h ] in baade s window , and a decrease in [ fe / h ] by 0.5 dex for the highest latitude field , i.e. , a vertical metallicity gradient in the bulge .",
    "rich ( 1990 ) showed that the metallicity distribution of his 88 bulge k giants compared well with the predicted metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the simple closed - box model of searle & sargent ( 1972 ) .",
    "this was unlike the mdf of the solar neighborhood , which shows a distinct deficit of metal - poor stars , known as `` the g - dwarf problem '' ( van den bergh 1962 ; schmidt 1963 ) .",
    "thus , it appeared that the bulge did not suffer from the _ g - dwarf problem _ seen in the mw disk .",
    "presumably , chemical evolution in the bulge was not affected by significant , prolonged , infall of metal - free gas , unlike the mw disk .",
    "geisler & friel ( 1992 ) used the washington photometric system to estimate the metallicity of 314 g and k giants in baade s window , giving a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath20.17@xmath170.15 dex ; they also confirmed a very good fit of their mdf to a closed - box model of chemical evolution .",

    "clearly , improved [ o / fe ] measurements of the plateau is desirable . in the context of the snia time - delay scenario of tinsley ( 1979 ) and mb90 : if the [ o / fe ] plateau in bulge and thick disk are the same , then the imf of the bulge and thick disk are equal .",
    "however , the plateau difference of 0.05 dex suggests that , in fact , the bulge imf included slightly more massive stars than the thick disk , but the [ o / fe ] difference is within measurement uncertainties .",
    "the plateau difference is not enough to explain the observed bulge / thick disk [ o / fe]=@xmath20.16 dex at solar [ fe / h ] , and why the bulge does not reach solar [ o / fe ] until [ fe / h ] near @xmath20.25 dex . from these measurements ,",
    "the snia time - delay idea ( see figure  [ fig - mb90 ] ) suggests that the sfr during bulge and thick disk evolution must have been higher than the thin disk , and the formation timescale correspondingly shorter . in this way , the bulge [ o / fe ] ratios indicate that the bulge chemical enrichment timescale was faster than for the thin disk , but similar to the thick disk ( although the thick disk stopped forming stars near solar [ fe / h ] ) .    as discussed later",
    ", an important feature of the [ o / fe ] trend in the bulge , especially evident in the b13 results , and indeed , the mw thin and thick disks , is that oxygen has a larger [ x / fe ] decline with metallicity than other alpha elements .",
    "this can not occur in the snia time - delay scenario if alpha - element [ x / fe ] ratios decline only by the addition of fe from snia ; an additional mechanism must be at work .",

    "reduction of the o yield via stellar wind mass - loss , and 2 . a steepening of the upper - end of the imf with increasing metallicity .",
    "like oxygen , it is thought that most magnesium production is associated with snii events , during the hydrostatic evolution of the progenitor star .",
    "thus , the evolution of both mg and o should follow the expectations of the snia time - delay scenario of tinsley ( 1979 ) and mb90 . for this reason , the trend of [ mg / fe ] with [ fe / h ] should depend on the bulge sfr .    beginning with mr94 , lecureur et al .",

    "since fmr07 employed arcturus as a standard , this removes a zero - point difference of 0.09 dex between fmr07 and j14 [ mg / fe ] ratios .",

    "an important mg  i abundance indicator , employed by several bulge studies , is the 6319  triplet , which is , unfortunately , blended with a very broad , shallow , ca  i auto - ionizing line . for giant star spectra ,",

    "i note that abundance ratios for stars in the lmc ( pompia et al .",
    "2008 ) and the sgr dwarf galaxy ( mcwilliam et al . 2013 ) fall on the same locus , despite their low oxygen abundances .",

    "again , we are confronted by our imperfect understanding of the mw disk composition !    the comparison of bulge and thick disk compositions is also complicated by the fact that most of the bulge studies have examined red giants , whereas the thick and thin disk chemical composition trends have been defined , almost entirely , from dwarf stars .",

    "it is possible that these giant - dwarf differences are due to non - lte effects in either the red giants or the dwarfs ; although , abundance differences with standard 1d - lte results may result from 3d hydrodynamic atmospheres and even non - plane parallel geometry ( in giants ) .",

    "if the thick disk and bulge [ @xmath5/fe ] trends are the same , then both the imf and sfr of the bulge and thick disk are similar . at the very least ,",
    "the bulge sfr was higher than for the thin disk .",
    "the observation that the bulge [ @xmath5/fe ] trends reach the solar value near [ fe / h]=@xmath20.3 dex indicates that the bulge sfr was crudely twice that of the thin disk and , if all else is assumed equal , the formation timescale roughly half that of the thin disk ; however , a more robust estimate would require a detailed chemical evolution model .    besides the well - known alpha - elements o , mg , si , ca and ti , the bulge shows an alpha - like trend for [ al / fe ] with [ fe / h ]",
    "this is expected , since , apart from relatively minor proton - burning re - arrangements , al production occurs in post carbon - burning hydrostatic phases of massive stars that end as snii events .",
    "this picture is corroborated by the al deficiencies in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al 2013 ) , that also show deficiencies of other hydrostatic alpha elements ( o , mg ) .",
    "indeed , the comparison of [ al / fe ] in bulge , mw disks , and sgr dwarf galaxy by fmr07 shows startling differences . however , nucleosynthesis predictions ( e.g. , nomoto et al .",
    "2006 , ww95 ) suggest that the al yields also depend on progenitor metallicity .",
    "if there is a mild increase in al yields with snii metallicity we would expect to see a slightly lower amplitude of the alpha - like trend .",
    "while the snia time - delay scenario can explain the similarity of declines in [ x / fe ] for most of the alpha - elements by the simple addition of fe from snia events , oxygen shows a steeper decline than the other alphas , starting from a higher [ o / fe ] plateau in metal - poor stars .",
    "this suggests that there must be a decline in the yield of oxygen with increasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "this effect is also revealed in the trends of [ o / mg ] and [ c / o ] with [ fe / h ] in the bulge and mw disks .",
    "chemical evolution models ( mcwilliam et al . 2008 ; cescutti et al . 2009 ) for snii element yields without stellar wind mass - loss fail to reproduce the observed [ o / mg ] and [ c / o ] ratios , whereas models including stellar winds match the shape of the observed abundance trends . however , estimated stellar wind mass - loss rates have declined in recent years , resulting in some uncertainty .",
    "these issues are connected with the production of wr stars and the importance of episodic mass - loss in massive stars .",
    "an important observation is that the [ @xmath5/fe ] trends with [ fe / h ] are the same for all locations within the bulge , as established by johnson et al .",
    "this has recently been confirmed for galactic latitudes , _ b _ , of 0@xmath15 , @xmath41@xmath15 and @xmath42@xmath15 , by ryde et al .",

    "b_=@xmath44@xmath15 rc giants .",
    "it is remarkable that the [ @xmath5/fe ] trends in the bulge and thick disk are so similar , suggesting a similar sfr and formation timescale to solar [ fe / h ] , despite the vastly different overall metallicities .",
    "perhaps , the difference in metallicity simply reflects different efficiencies in retaining sn ejecta .",
    "an interesting characteristic of the bulge alpha - elements , first noticed by fmr07 , is that the trends of [ o / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , and [ @xmath6sicati@xmath7/fe ] show tight relations below [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath41 dex , quite unlike the halo , for example seen in figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] . in this regard",
    "the bulge also resembles the thick disk : the large dispersion in halo [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios below [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath41 is due to an inhomogeneous halo , probably resulting from accretion of dwarf galaxies with a variety of star formation histories . on the other hand ,",
    "both the mw thick disk and bulge appear to have been much more homogeneous .",
    "the trend of [ cu / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in the bulge , only measured by j14 , is very different than the mw thin and thick disks . at low metallicity",
    ", the slope of increasing [ cu / fe ] with [ fe / h ] continues to higher [ cu / fe ] than the mw disks , near [ cu / fe ] of @xmath20.4 to @xmath20.5 dex ; whereas , the mw thick and thin disks flatten - out near [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath40.7 dex , presumably due to the addition of snia fe .",
    "the bulge [ cu / fe ] trend declines from @xmath3@xmath20.4 dex , near [ fe / h]=@xmath40.2 dex , down to [ cu / fe]=@xmath20.2 dex , as if the addition of snia fe occurred much later in the bulge than the mw disks .",
    "finally , near [ fe / h]=@xmath3@xmath20.2 dex , the [ cu / fe ] trend starts to increase again .",
    "this is similar to the zig - zag shape of the very small amplitude trend of [ na / fe ] with [ fe / h ] .",
    "if the cu measurements of j14 are correct , these results are qualitatively consistent with the time - delay scenario of tinsley ( 1979 ) and mb90 , for cu produced by massive stars with a metal - dependent yield , as expected for the weak s - process in massive stars ( e.g. , pignatari et al . 2010 ) ; but , the delayed snia fe began at a higher [ fe / h ] in the bulge , suggesting involvement of massive star ejecta to higher [ fe / h ] , probably due to a higher sfr .",
    "in fact , the unusual bulge [ cu / fe ] trend , if real , is consistent with the snia time - delay scenario .    while this suggests that the bulge chemistry , and therefore evolution , was very different than the mw thick disk , it may still be that the bulge [ cu / fe ] trend follows the trajectory that the thick disk would have produced if it had not run out of gas .",
    "interestingly , the bulge and thick disk [ cu / fe ] trends differ at [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath40.7 dex , right where the thick disk mdf starts to decline , presumably due to gas - loss .",
    "this may relate to the low [ @xmath5/fe ] in putative thick disk stars just below solar metallicity .",
    "it may indicate that the mw thick disk really did decline in [ @xmath5/fe ] after the mdf peak , whereas the bulge had plenty of gas to maintain its [ @xmath5/fe ] trend and produce plentiful amounts cu .    clearly ,",
    "it is important to check the [ cu / fe ] results of j14 , for both bulge dwarfs and giants ; in particular , more non - lte calculations are desperately needed .",
    "notably , zinc is expected to share some similarities in its nucleosynthetic origin ( alpha - rich freeze - out plus weak s - process ) as copper , and so would provide a useful comparison .",
    "the two studies of zn in the bulge show different measured trends : one identical to the mw disks , and the other showing a decline in [ zn / fe ] above [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath40.2 dex , similar to [ cu / fe ] but at a lower enhancement level",
    ". it would be useful to determine which of the two measured trends for bulge stars is correct .",
    "the [ mn / fe ] trend with [ fe / h ] in the bulge , mw thin and thick disks are identical , to within measurement error .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation that mn is over - produced in snia with the rising [ mn / fe ] due to the increasing snia / snii ratio with [ fe / h ] . since the bulge [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios at solar [ fe / h ] are near @xmath20.15 dex , less snia material and therefore , less , mn from snia is expected ; a low [ mn / fe ] ratio is predicted for high [ @xmath5/fe ] , especially compared to the thin disk .",
    "if the lte measurements are correct , then mn is most likely produced proportional to metallicity , by both snia and snii events .",
    "however , present day non - lte corrections considerably flatten the steeply increasing [ mn / fe ] trend with [ fe / h ] seen in lte .",
    "if correct , then the mn abundances provide very little constraints on its production in snia and snii events .",
    "due to the alpha - like trend of the r - process element europium , the [ eu / fe ] trend with [ fe / h ] offers the possibility the compare the sfr in the bulge and disk .",
    "unfortunately , the disk trends are not well defined , or at least not completely converged ; thus , how the bulge compares depends upon which mw comparison study is employed .",
    "notwithstanding , if the battistini & bensby ( 2016 ) mw disk data are employed , then the bulge [ eu / fe ] follows the disk , but without sufficient precision to distinguish between thick and thin components .",
    "a probe into the chemical evolution of the bulge can be obtained from the rise of the s - process , which is normally driven by low - mass ( 23 m@xmath11 ) agb stars .",
    "the [ la / eu ] ratio measures the s - process / r - process ratio and only increases when the low - mass agb stars produce s - process ( associated with he - shell burning episodes ) .",
    "although the data possess measurement scatter that is larger than one would like , it appears that the bulge [ la / eu ] ratio begins to increase at a higher [ fe / h ] than the mw disks , indicating a higher sfr in the bulge .",
    "however , these measurements need to be greatly improved upon .",
    "evidence in recent years , including the presence of a bar , a boxy / peanut shape , the x - shape bulge , and disk kinematics ( e.g. see wegg & gerhard 2013 ) has led to the conclusion that the bulge was built by the growth of a stellar bar , through accretion of stars from the inner galactic disk , and was subsequently subject to buckling processes that thickened the bar into the bulge morphology seen today .    any bulge evolution model should produce these kinematic and morphological features , as well as match the observed vertical metallicity gradient , chemical composition trends , and the multi- , or bi - modal mdf .",
    "here , i provide a sketch of this evolution and how the chemical composition trends might have occurred ( but , see di  matteo 2016 for a more detailed discussion of bulge chemodynamics ) .",
    "first , it is notable that the metal - rich bulge sub - population , which is concentrated toward the galactic plane , has a mean [ fe / h ] in excess of the solar neighborhood thin disk , with [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios indicating the presence of nucleosynthesis products from snia .",
    "thus , this bulge sub - population shares kinematic and chemical characteristics with the local thin disk , albeit at higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "on the other hand , the [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath40.3 dex bulge sub - population shows a relatively large vertical scale height and [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios indicating higher sfr and more rapid formation than the local thin disk , but similar or slightly faster than the local thick disk ; these chemical and kinematic characteristics suggests that this population is similar to the local thick disk , but at significantly higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "if these assumptions are correct , both the thick disk and thin disk are represented in the bulge , but at significantly higher [ fe / h ] than at the solar circle ( by about 0.3 dex ) , which suggests radial [ fe / h ] gradients for both thin and thick disks , near @xmath40.04 to @xmath40.05 dex per kpc between the bulge and solar circle .",
    "these metallicity gradients might be due to more efficient retention of sn ejecta in the inner galaxy .",
    "high mean bulge mdfs could also be accomplished by a reduction of the mass locked - up in low - mass , unevolved , stars . while this is a modification of the imf",
    ", the bulge [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios require that the relative proportions of snii and snia be similar to the thick disk , so there can be no large modification of the imf slope of massive stars , only a reduced number of unevolved stars .",
    "although radial inflow of gas could increase the overall mdf of the bulge , this would also result in a bulge g - dwarf problem ( a deficiency of metal - poor stars ) and slightly lower [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios compared to the solar circle , but these are not seen .    since the relatively low [ fe / h ] of inner thick disk mdf indicates that it did not reach the yield , chemical evolution terminated before complete consumption of the gas .",
    "thus , this gas must have gone somewhere else , or have been lost from the galaxy altogether . on the other hand ,",
    "the inner thin disk gas , represented by the [ fe / h]=@xmath20.3 dex sub - population , must have come from somewhere .",
    "it seems likely , and logical , that the thick disk gas ultimately settled into the thin disk , both at the solar circle and inner disk region , due to molecular cloud collisions .",
    "stars that formed before the gas settled retained the kinematic signature of the gas at the time of their formation , in particular with disk kinematics and large vertical scale height .    however , at the solar circle the thick disk gas stopped chemical enrichment at a lower [ fe / h ] than for the inner thick disk .",
    "the , presumably , higher gas densities in the inner disk region would result in higher sfr and shorter formation timescale compared to the solar neighborhood thick disk , as suggested by the slightly higher [ @xmath5/fe ] , lower [ la / eu ] , and higher [ cu / fe ] ratios observed in the bulge .",
    "the inner thin disk would then have formed out of the settling inner thick disk gas , resulting in a continuity of the chemical composition trends , as observed .",
    "finally , instabilities in the thin disk ( e.g. , as outlined by athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; wegg & gerhard 2013 ) led to a stellar bar and its thickening , by buckling processes , into the boxy / peanut / x - shape morphology with disk - like kinematics seen today .",
    "the inner thick and thin disk stars entrained into the x - shape morphology by the bar retained vertical scale heights similar to their original values , resulting in the vertical [ fe / h ] gradient and bimodal mdf .",
    "the scenario sketched above suggests a number of consistency checks and questions .",
    "for example , if radial gas inflow were responsible for higher [ fe / h ] in the inner regions , lower [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios might be expected , but the opposite is observed .",
    "the metal - rich bulge sub - population should be slightly younger than the metal - poor population , with a longer formation timescale , consistent with the observed low [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios and high [ la / eu ] ratios .",
    "but , what was the actual formation timescale of the inner disk ? it might be possible to probe this question using chemical abundance patterns for s - process elements and connecting those to the mass of the s - process sites .",
    "for example , most s - process elements in the solar neighborhood thin disk are thought to be produced by 23 m@xmath11 agb stars with neutrons provided by the @xmath28c(@xmath5,@xmath37)@xmath8o source .",
    "however , the s - process abundance pattern produced by intermediate mass agb stars is expected to be somewhat different ( e.g. busso et al .",
    "2004 ) ; in particular , the @xmath30ne(@xmath5,@xmath37)@xmath31 mg neutron source and high neutron densities dominates for 58 m@xmath11 agb stars , and should result in relative enhancements of @xmath31 mg , @xmath38 mg , @xmath39zr and @xmath40rb .",
    "these isotopes can be measured in rgb stars , from mgh , zro and rb  i lines , and might provide a constraint on the inner disk formation timescale",
    ".    it would be interesting to measure the [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios in the bulge to much higher precision .",
    "high - precision chemical abundances of local thin and thick disk stars by reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show considerable overlap in [ fe / h ] , but the two populations are separated in [ @xmath5/fe ] by 0.15 to 0.2 dex .",
    "this is clearly related to the evolution of the local thin and thick disks ; therefore , it would be useful to know whether the bulge / inner thin and thick disk populations also show similar [ fe / h ] overlap and small separations in [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "more precise abundance measurements would also permit a better evaluation of the relative sfr for the inner thick disk / bulge compared to the solar neighborhood thick disk , based on the [ @xmath5/fe ] and [ la / eu ] trends with [ fe / h ] .",
    "indeed , a systematic study of the detailed elemental abundances in the thick disk between the solar circle and bulge region would provide a useful test of the above scenario : one expects a general increase in [ fe / h ] with decreasing galactocentric radius , and subtle increases in the sfr , reflected in [ @xmath5/fe ] , [ cu / fe ] and [ la / eu ] abundance trends .",
    "the bulge shows a vertical [ fe / h ] gradient , at @xmath30.5 dex / kpc , with more metal - rich stars concentrated toward the plane . the average and median [ fe / h ] in baade s window bulge field , at _ b_=@xmath43.9@xmath15 is @xmath20.06 dex and @xmath20.15 dex respectively .",

    "both studies suggest that the vertical gradient is due to changing proportions of these sub - populations .",
    "the higher mean and median [ fe / h ] values for the bulge , compared to the local thin and thick disks , indicates a higher yield for the bulge .",

    "it is remarkable that the [ @xmath5/fe ] trends of the thick disk and bulge are so close , suggesting similar sfr , even though their metallicities differ enormously .",
    "the [ la / eu ] ratio , indicating the onset of the s - process and presence of ejecta from 23 m@xmath11 agb stars , is consistent with a slightly higher sfr and shorter formation timescale for the bulge , compared to the mw disks .",
    "the [ cu / fe ] trend , measured by only one study , j14 , shows a stunningly different trend than thick disk or thin disk . however , the zig - zag [ cu / fe ] trend is qualitatively consistent with the combination of a high bulge sfr and metal - dependent cu yields from massive stars ( as expected ) in the presence of the snia time delay scenario .",
    "curiously , the [ na / fe ] ratios in the bulge , while close to the solar ratio , shows a small amplitude zig - zag trend , similar to [ cu / fe ] , suggesting the presence of metal - dependent na yields from massive stars .",
    "the trend of lte [ mn / fe ] ratios are the same in the bulge as the mw thick and thin disks , to within measurement uncertainty .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation that snia over - produce mn .",
    "since the ratio of snia / snii material is lower in the bulge than the thin disk , as evidenced from [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios , lower [ mn / fe ] are be expected in the bulge , but are not seen . predicted non - lte corrections to the lte mn abundances suggest that the trend of this element could be seriously affected by non - lte effects .",
    "the remarkable bulge [ cu / fe ] trends found by j14 need to be checked",
    ". the information may already be present in the lensed dwarf spectra of b13 .",
    "since cu  i lines are strong , and possibly vulnerable to saturation effects in k giants , more robust abundances may be obtained from the warmer rc giants and lensed dwarf stars . however , strong hfs effects in cu  i lines are helpful for de - saturating the lines and increasing abundance sensitivity .    high precision abundances are required for bulge alpha - elements . the bulge mdf sub - populations in ness et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and hill et al .",
    "( 2011 ) should be carefully studied , in order to see whether there is a continuous chemical composition trend , or discrete [ @xmath5/fe ] trends for each sub - population , similar to the [ @xmath5/fe ] differences between local thick and thin disks ( e.g. figure  [ fig - b14sicati90 ] ) .",
    "neutron - capture elements , especially eu , la , should be measured to better precision than heretofore obtained , in order to further identify the [ fe / h ] of the nucleosynthetic onset of low - mass agb stars , for comparison with the mw disks .",
    "other elements of interest include rb , which is thought to be made in s - processing driven by the @xmath30ne(@xmath5,n)@xmath31 mg neutron source , prevalent in intermediate mass agb and massive stars .",
    "increased mg isotopic ratios ( 25/24 and 16/24 ) reveal the same neutron source in similar stars ; thus , isotopic mg measurements , based on the mgh lines near 5130  would be of interest .",
    "for all the above abundance goals it would be best to obtain high resolving power spectra ( r=40,000 to 60,000 ) in order to separate - out blends , to detect continuum , and for increased line depths and abundance sensitivity . however , for mg isotopes high s / n , @xmath3100 and high resolving power ( r@xmath380,000 to 120,000 ) are best .",
    "warmer rc giants offer the possibility for superior abundance measurements than the more luminous k giants , due to reduced line blending , greater continuum and frequently less saturated lines .",
    "however , higher s / n is also required .",
    "one possibility is to look at metal - normal and metal - rich bulge stars at higher latitudes ( e.g. _ b_=@xmath48@xmath15 ) , where the extinction is much reduced .",
    "this may be effective , as it appears that the [ @xmath5/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] trends are identical over the whole bulge , as if kinematic heating simply brought some of the metal - rich populations into higher latitude orbits .",
    "temperatures should be based on the excitation of fe  i lines , and measured from line - by - line differential analysis relative to solar neighborhood standards , like arcturus ( e.g. fmr07 , hill et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an impediment to our understanding is the ability to compare the composition of the same types of stars in the bulge and thick and thin disks .",
    "therefore , we need to robustly determine the abundance effects involved with dwarf and giant star comparisons ; in this regard , a survey of mw thin and thick disk giants , using the identical abundance analysis methods to the bulge stars would be helpful .",
    "the @xmath5-rich thin disk stars near solar [ fe / h ] in the bensby et al .",
    "( 2014 ) study should be examined more closely to verify their validity .",
    "a study of the radial [ fe / h ] and composition gradients in the thick disk would provide a useful consistency check on the bulge formation scenario : as galactocentric radius decreases , gradual increases in the mean [ fe / h ] , higher [ @xmath5/fe ] and lower [ la / eu ] ratios are expected , consistent with higher sfr and shorter formation timescales toward the bulge . finally , we need non - lte corrections for cu , alphas , and all other elements of interest in the bulge .",
    "these non - lte corrections should be verified empirically .",
    "for example , by studying the composition of dwarf and giant stars in clusters of different metallicity , similar to work done by korn et al .",
