    "finite amplitude waves in a plasma have been studied intensively for decades in regard to a broad range of physical problems related to astrophysics , magnetic and inertial confinement thermonuclear fusion and in nonlinear wave theory @xcite . in particular , nonlinear plasma waves are of crucial importance for wakefield acceleration in plasma configurations where the wakewave is generated either by laser pulses @xcite or by bunches of relativistic electrons @xcite , for high - harmonic generation @xcite and for many other aspects of laser - plasma physics @xcite . in order to support a strong electric field the langmuir wave must be highly nonlinear . in a stationary wave",
    "the limit on the field amplitude is imposed by the wave breaking condition @xcite , while in a nonstationary wave in the regime beyond the wavebreaking point the electric field can be even higher @xcite .    nonlinear wave breaking exhibits one of the fundamental phenomena in the mechanics of continuous media .",
    "when the wave amplitude approaches and/or exceeds the breaking limit the wave form becomes singular as its profile steepens , finally leading to the formation of a multi - stream motion . even in the simplest case of one - dimensional electrostatic langmuir waves in collisionless",
    "plasmas this process still attracts great interest due to its importance both for the wave amplitude limitation @xcite and for its practical relevance to the electron injection into the wakefield acceleration phase @xcite . in the application to the laser wake field acceleration attention",
    "is paid mainly to the determination of the upper limit for the electric field @xcite .",
    "thermal effects in a warm plasma can reduce the maximum wave amplitude @xcite and modify the character of the singularity @xcite .",
    "a finite plasma temperature limits the electron density in the breaking wave but in the general case does not necessarily lead to smooth density distributions . since the results obtained by b. riemann in the 19@xmath0 century on the wave breaking of nonlinear sound waves ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite ) , it has been known that thermal effects do not prevent the  gradient catastrophe \" . in this case",
    "the singularity in the breaking wave corresponds to a shock - like wave profile .",
    "other remarkable singularities are known for nonlinear waves on a water surface which at the breaking points become of the type of `` stokes s traveling crested extreme wave '' with the interior crest angle of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we also note here the exact solutions , known as `` peakons '' , of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the waves on shallow water that have the form of a soliton with a discontinuous first derivative @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the structure of the langmuir wave breaking and show that crested langmuir waves in thermal plasmas have a profile with a discontinuous first derivative .",
    "in the case of a plasma irradiated by a high intensity laser pulse the temperature is determined by the laser light parameters for the time interval before the main pulse comes . during the interaction of a femtosecond , terawatt laser pulse with gas targets",
    "a plasma is created via photoionization @xcite by the prepulse or by the ase ( amplified spontaneous emission ) pedestal . in such a collisionless plasma",
    "the electron energy is of the order of the quiver energy in the ionizing laser field , i.e. typically in the range below @xmath2 .",

    "conversely , this indicates that thermal effects tend to favour landau damping in the case of a particle distribution that is not piece - wise constant and wavebreaking in the case of a water - bag distribution .    as can be seen from eq.([eq25-omthrml ] ) a finite temperature modifies the langmuir frequency and makes it depend on the wavenumber , @xmath48 . in terms of the variable",
