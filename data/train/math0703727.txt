    "a _ quandle _ is a non - associative algebraic structure whose axioms may be understood as transcriptions of the reidemeister moves . the term `` quandle '' was introduced by joyce @xcite , though quandles have been studied by other authors under various names such as `` distributive groupoids '' @xcite and ( for a certain special case ) `` kei '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) . several generalizations of quandles have been defined and studied , including _ automorphic sets _ ( see @xcite ) and _ racks _ ( see @xcite ) where the axioms are derived from regular isotopy moves , _ virtual quandles _ ( see @xcite ) where additional structure is included for modeling virtual reidemeister moves , and _ biquandles _ and _ yang - baxter sets _ , which also have axioms derived from the reidemeister moves but use a different correspondence between algebra elements and portions of link diagrams .",
    "quandles have found applications in topology as a source of invariants of topological spaces . in particular , finite quandles are useful for defining computable invariants of knotted circles in @xmath2 and other 3-manifolds as well as generalizations of ordinary knots such as virtual knots , knotted surfaces in @xmath3 , etc .    in @xcite , an example of a quandle structure defined on a module @xmath4 over a commutative ring @xmath0 with a choice of antisymmetric bilinear form",

    "the primary application for finite quandles has so far been in the construction of link invariants . given a finite quandle @xmath57 we have the quandle counting invariant @xmath103 , the quandle 2-cocycle invariants @xmath104 and the specialized subquandle polynomial invariants @xmath105 described in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the connected component of a symplectic quandle over a finite field is a finite connected quandle which generally has a number of nontrivial subquandles , making this type of quandle well suited for the specialized subquandle polynomial invariant . in this section",
    "we describe two additional ways of getting extra information about the knot or link type from the set of homomorphisms from a link quandle into a finite symplectic quandle .",
    "one easy way to get more information out of the set @xmath103 is to count the cardinalities of the image subquandles for each @xmath106 ; even if @xmath57 is connected , the smallest subquandle of @xmath57 containing the images of generators of @xmath107 need not be the entire quandle @xmath57 .",
    "if instead of counting 1 for each homomorphism @xmath58 , we count the cardinality of the image of @xmath58 , we obtain a set with multiplicities of integers , which we can convert into a polynomial for easy comparison with other invariant values by converting the elements of the set to exponents of a variable @xmath108 and converting the multiplicities to coefficients .",
    "thus we have      this enhanced quandle counting invariant can be understood as a decomposition of the usual quandle counting invariant into a sum of counting invariants over all subquandles of our target quandle with the restriction that we only count _ surjective _ homomorphisms onto each subquandle .    for any subquandle @xmath110 of a finite quandle @xmath57 ,",

    ". in particular , if @xmath0 is not a field then we must be careful to specify the @xmath0-module structure of @xmath57 and our choice of bilinear form .",
    "every element of @xmath122 is a constant map into a single element of @xmath57 .",
    "the zero map contributes @xmath123 to the sum , while each of the nonzero constant maps has image subquandle consisting of a single element of @xmath57 which spans a dimension 1 subspace ; hence each of these @xmath124 maps contributes @xmath125 to the sum .",
    "our initial computations suggest that these symplectic quandle polynomial invariants are quite non - trivial for virtual links , though the fact that finite symplectic quandles tend to have rather large cardinality ( @xmath131 ) means that more efficient computing algorithms may be required to explore these invariants in greater detail .",
    "our ` maple ` software is able to compute @xmath128 for links with smallish numbers of crossings for symplectic quandles of order @xmath132 in a relatively short amount of time , but the time requirement increases rapidly as @xmath133 and @xmath54 increase ."
