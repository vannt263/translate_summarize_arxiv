    "the idea that gravitational and gauge interactions can be unified in more than four space - time dimensions has been widely explored in various frameworks @xcite .",

    "this possibility has been scrutinized from different perspectives .",
    "new solutions of the einstein field equations ( originally studied in the case of two transverse dimensions @xcite ) were obtained in the case when the number of transverse dimensions @xmath1 is equal to two @xcite or even larger than two @xcite ( see also @xcite for an earlier work on @xmath2 transverse dimensions ) .",
    "the description of gravity assumed in the discussion of @xcite relies on the einstein - hilbert action supplemented by a bulk cosmological constant and by matter sources ( describing static topological defects living in the internal space ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the scenario analyzed in @xcite in the framework of a different gravity theory where quadratic self - interactions are consistently included in the higher dimensional action .",
    "the form of the gravity action considered in the present paper will then be is the dimensionality of the space - time ( @xmath1 labels the number of transverse dimensions ) .",

    "the egb combination is a topological term : its contribution to the action can be rearranged in a perfect four divergence which does not contribute to the classical equations of motion . in four dimensions the egb combination coincides with the euler invariant . in dimensions",
    "higher than four the egb combination is not a total divergence and it does contribute to the classical equations of motion with terms containing ( at most ) a second derivative of the metric . needless to say that , from a cosmological point of view , the absence of derivatives higher than the second makes tractable ( without the addition of extra initial conditions ) the problem of the dynamical evolution @xcite . in a different perspective",

    "the egb is required for the supersimmetrization of the lorentz - chern - simons term .",
