    "spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by phase transitions is one of the central themes of statistical physics . from a homogeneous and isotropic liquid phase transitions can occur to phases with positional or orientational long - ranged order of the individual particles .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the case of pure orientational order .",
    "well known examples of such systems are the nematic liquid crystals .",
    "initially , it was suspected that dipolar interactions are responsible for the formation of the nematic state @xcite .",
    "later , it became clear that the short - ranged steric interactions between strongly anisotropic ( elongated or disklike ) nonpolar molecules are sufficient to generate a nematic phase .",
    "on the other hand , it is an interesting question whether dipolar interactions alone , i.e. , in the absence of anisotropic steric interactions , are also capable of stabilizing an orientationally ordered liquid . that this is indeed possible",
    "has been shown for the first time some years ago in computer simulations of a dipolar soft sphere fluid by wei and patey @xcite .",
    "similar observations were made for dipolar hard spheres @xcite and the stockmayer fluid @xcite , in which the spherically symmetric lennard - jones potential is added to the dipolar interactions .",
    "depending on whether one deals with electric or magnetic dipole moments this new phase , in which the dipoles are aligned over macroscopic distances , is called a ferroelectric or ferromagnetic liquid . in the following",
    "we will adopt the magnetic language keeping in mind that all results are equally valid in the electric case . theoretically this phase transition was predicted within mean - field theory for a dipolar lattice gas @xcite and by a generalized van der waals theory @xcite . a density - functional theory using as input direct correlation functions of the isotropic liquid obtained from an integral equation theory qualitatively confirmed these findings @xcite .",
    "more recent work along the same lines @xcite predicts that the ferromagnetic liquid is metastable with respect to freezing . it might be possible to improve upon this approach by directly calculating the direct correlation function in the ordered phase using the methods of [ pyordered ] .",
    "the present authors also developed a density - functional description @xcite using a relatively crude approximation for the pair correlation function , whose results will be reviewed in this paper .",
    "in contrast to [ patey3 ] and to the simulations this approach enables one to map out whole phase diagrams which turn out to exhibit an interesting topology varying with the dipole strength .",
    "other authors have focused on the isotropic - ferromagnetic spinodal which corresponds to a divergence of the dielectric constant , whose position can be estimated using correlation functions from different integral equation theories @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention perturbation theory as an alternative approach to determine successfully liquid - vapor coexistence of stockmayer fluids with rigid or polarizable dipoles @xcite .    in all theoretical treatments particular care must be taken of the long range of the dipolar interaction @xcite which may give rise to diverging integrals .",
    "several approaches to handle these problems have been suggested @xcite , the most consistent one being an explicit performance of the thermodynamic limit starting from a large but finite sample of a given shape @xcite . for a homogeneously magnetized fluid",
    "one finds an energy contribution that depends on the sample shape .",
    "however , this shape dependence disappears if inhomogeneously magnetized configurations are taken into account @xcite .",
    "these complications do not arise in heisenberg fluids governed by short - ranged exchange interactions for which similar phase transitions and phase diagrams have been found @xcite .",
    "for this model as well as for the corresponding ising fluid @xcite there is an ongoing discussion concerning the values of the critical exponents describing the isotropic - ferromagnetic transition @xcite . a potts fluid with @xmath0 states exhibits only first - order isotropic - ferromagnetic transitions @xcite . for a review of the properties of dipolar and spin fluids as obtained from simulations see [ nijmeijerrev ] .",
    "experimentally a ferromagnetic liquid phase in dipolar fluids has not yet been found .",
    "the dipole moments of molecular fluids seem to be too low , though only by a small factor , compared to those that led to ferromagnetism in the simulations . in ferrofluids @xcite , i.e. , colloidal suspensions of small single - domain ferromagnetic particles , chemical tailoring facilitates higher reduced dipole moments ; the relevant dimensionless quantity is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dipole moment and @xmath3 the particle diameter . however , in the simulations the phase transition always occurs at high packing fractions that are presently not attainable in ferrofluids . due to the combination of fluidity and strong paramagnetism ferrofluids",
    "already have a wide range of technical applications that would certainly be enlarged if a ferromagnetic phase could be established .",
    "electro - rheological and magneto - rheological fluids @xcite also have high technological relevance . in these systems",
    "dipole moments are induced in the colloidal particles by external electric or magnetic fields and large differences between the permitivities of the solute and the solvent which then give rise to strong dipolar particle interactions having a pronounced effect on their rheological properties . however , spontaneous orientational order in the absence of external fields is not possible in these fluids .",
    "ferromagnetic metals become paramagnetic already far below their melting temperature .",
    "therefore it came as a surprise when recently ferromagnetism was detected for the first time in a liquid metal . in co@xmath4pd@xmath5",
    "the melting temperature is sufficiently close to the curie temperature so that ferromagnetism in the liquid state can be reached by undercooling @xcite . for the formation of the ferromagnetic order in these materials short - ranged exchange interactions play an important role .",
    "however , in addition dipolar interactions are also present and , as in solid ferromagnets , are essential in forming the domain structure .",
    "therefore for these systems we expect strong similarities to the behavior of dipolar fluids as discussed here .",
    "two other closely related peculiarities of simple dipolar fluids have attracted much attention recently .",
    "strongly dipolar hard or soft spheres form chains of head - to - tail aligned particles at very low densities @xcite .",
    "the chain formation hinders the condensation of liquid droplets .",
    "thus a certain amount of spherically symmetric dispersion interaction is necessary in order to obtain liquid - gas coexistence in a dipolar fluid @xcite ( but see also [ tavares ] ) . alternatively , liquid - gas coexistence of hard dipolar particles is promoted if they are slightly elongated , which renders the energies of the head - to - tail and the antiparallel side - to - side configuration more equal .",

    "<S> we determine the details of the magnetization structure in a cubic sample in the absence and in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a vortexlike structure with an escape of the magnetization into the axis direction near the vortex axis and two point defects where the absolute value of the magnetization is strongly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> if the spherical cores of the particles are replaced by elongated or oblate shapes a nematic phase without spontaneous magnetization is also possible due to the anisotropic steric interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we study the interplay of this nematic ordering with ferromagnetism in fluids of dipolar hard ellipsoids . </S>",
    "<S> orientational order arises locally in the isotropic fluid phases near the liquid - gas interface of the stockmayer fluid . </S>",
    "<S> density - functional theory allows us to determine density and orientational order profiles as well as the surface tension of this interface . </S>"
