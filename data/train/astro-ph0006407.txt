    "the two point correlation function , @xmath23 , has been widely used to analyze the clustering properties of galaxies and galaxy systems ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "clusters and groups of galaxies can be used as suitable tracers of the large scale structure of the universe . in fact , several works have characterized the clustering properties of rich clusters of galaxies ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) concluding that the cluster autocorrelation function has a similar shape than the galaxy correlation function with a larger amplitude .",
    "the clustering properties of groups of galaxies were analyzed by @xcite for the cfa groups ( @xcite ) , by @xcite for the ssrs group catalog ( @xcite ) , and by @xcite for groups of the cfa slices ( @xcite ) where a significant lower amplitude of @xmath23 is detected for these systems when compared to rich clusters , as expected in hierarchical scenarios of structure formation in the universe .",
    "however , the typical values found for the correlation length , @xmath24 , for the groups examined by these authors are significantly different , perhaps due to the small size , and the different selection criteria of the samples examined . in a more detailed work",
    "@xcite examine how the different criteria of assignment of galaxies into groups affect the determination of @xmath23 .",
    "they claim that the differences found in previous works may be due to the distinct values of the density contrast adopted to generate the catalogs of groups , which resulted in groups with distinct physical properties .",
    "groups have lower richness and higher space density than the apm , abell or x - ray selected clusters , allowing a detailed analysis of the behavior of the @xmath24 at such regimes of space density .",
    "it worths to be mentioned that the relation between @xmath24 and the mean intergroup separation , @xmath11 , for values of @xmath11 lesser than @xmath25 has not been extensively explored .",
    "moreover , the predictions of current hierarchical models differ from the universal scaling law proposed by @xcite at large scales ( @xcite and @xcite ) , as well as at the smaller scales where this work is focused .    in this paper",
    "we analyze two new samples of groups of galaxies , the first one , taken from the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc ) by @xcite which contains redshift information for galaxies of the catalog of galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other group catalog , is derived from southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 ) by @xcite .",
    "both samples resulted , mainly , from the effort of the on and cfa redshift surveys in the past 20 years , but since uzc and ssrs2 come from distinct galaxy catalogs , we treat both as independent samples , thus avoiding the mixture of each one biases , also allowing us , a cross - check of results .",
    "section 2 describes how the groups were defined and which are their general properties . in section 3",
    "we analyze the clustering properties of these groups using the autocorrelation function .",
    "a brief summary of our conclusions is presented in section 4 .",
    "the recent release of the uzc of galaxies ( @xcite ) , containing 19,369 objects with @xmath26 and with 96% of completeness in redshift , and the ssrs2 ( @xcite ) , containing 5369 galaxies with @xmath27 which covers a region of 1.70 sr of the southern celestial hemisphere .",
    "the large area of sky covered , the relative fainter magnitude limit , and the very good completeness in redshift of both catalogs , make them a powerful resource to perform statistical analysis of the galaxy properties in the nearby universe .",
    "we used the uzc and ssrs2 to generate new catalogs of groups of galaxies to investigate their clustering properties by means of the correlation function .",
    "the algorithm adopted for the construction of the catalog of groups of galaxies is basically the one described by @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in `` real physical systems '' , the adopted friends - of - friends algorithm ( described below ) , searches for possible group member galaxies , keeping a fixed surrounding density contrast ( @xmath28 ) relative to the mean density of galaxies in the catalog .",
    "a @xmath0 was adopted because it was demonstrated by @xcite to be the best compromise in identifying as many physical loose groups as possible and including all systems with high velocity dispersion , but avoiding contamination of the catalog by pseudo - groups as well as groups with interlopers ( see also discussion by @xcite and @xcite ) .    a search for companions around galaxies is carried out taking into account projected separations satisfying    @xmath29    and with line - of - sight velocity differences ,    @xmath30    in the above expressions @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the radial velocities of the galaxies , and @xmath34 their angular separation .",
    "the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 are search parameters scaled according to the expressions below in order to take into account the variation in the sampling of the galaxy luminosity function , @xmath37 , with distance    @xmath38    where    @xmath39^{-1/3}\\ ] ]    @xmath40    @xmath41\\ ] ]    @xmath42 is the selection parameter at a fixed fiducial radial velocity , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath36 is scaled in the same way as @xmath35 .    to generate the uzc groups ( guzc ) , the adopted values for @xmath42 and @xmath44 were @xmath45 and 350 respectively ; the apparent magnitude limit , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the groups present a surrounding @xmath0 , for a @xcite luminosity function adopted for the total sample , parameterized by @xmath48 galaxies mag@xmath3 mpc@xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ssrs2 groups ( gssrs2 ) are obtained with the same @xmath0 , but for values for @xmath42 and @xmath44 @xmath52 and 350 respectively .",
    "the apparent magnitude , @xmath53 , while the luminosity function is parameterized by @xmath54 galaxies mag@xmath3 mpc@xmath49 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have also computed the virial masses of the groups combining the virial radius and the velocity dispersion @xmath57 which provide suitable estimates of group masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "according to the same authors , several groups with 3 or 4 members may be unreliable , although we should expect a low degree of contamination by pseudo - groups ( as small as 10% ) by adopting @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting group catalogs contain systems with at least 4 members and mean radial velocities , @xmath59 15,000 ( guzc ) , and @xmath59 12,000 ( gssrs2 ) consisting in the largest sample of groups of galaxies homogeneously selected to the present . for analysis purposes , we removed groups in regions of galactic latitude @xmath60 and declination @xmath61 for guzc and for the gssrs2 we only considered groups within the following limits : @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( southern galactic cap ) and @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( northern galactic cap ) .",
    "this choice provides a sample free of strong obscuration from the galaxy and also avoids possible lack of homogeneity in the falco catalog due to the not complete coverage of the zwicky catalog in part of those regions . for both them ,",
    "very rich groups containing more than 40 galaxies were also removed , to avoid the presence of rich clusters in our analysis .",
    "in addition to the above criteria , those groups with @xmath59 2,000 were also discarded from the analysis , to prevent any significant contribution of the group peculiar velocities in the measured redshifts which were used to determine their distances .",
    "the projected distribution of the guzc ( panel a ) and gssrs2 ( panel b ) groups in equatorial coordinates is shown in figure 1 .",
    "histograms of the distributions of @xmath66 and group mass ( @xmath9 ) for the systems of the guzc ( panel a ) and gssrs2 ( panel b ) are presented in figures 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "the velocity distribution of groups is similar to the one for galaxies , and a more detailed examination of the estimated masses for groups between 2000 and 5000 confirms the reliability of this determination , in the sense that groups with lower masses are made up of few bright galaxies or , if they have a large number of members , they also contain a higher fraction of intrinsically less luminous objects .",
    "the lower richness and higher space densities of guzc and gssrs2 groups , compared to the apm or x - ray selected clusters allow the evaluation of the dependence of @xmath24 with @xmath11 to be examined for higher regimes of spatial densities in order to extend the available data of this relation and to compare with the @xmath67 law ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial correlation function is computed using the estimator given by @xcite    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the number of real and random pairs of groups at separation @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the number of objects in the data and random catalogs , respectively .",
    "we use an equal weighting of each data / random point for simplicity given that error bars in our samples are significantly larger than the expected differences between the estimates of @xmath23 from different weighting schemes according to the analysis by @xcite .",
    "the catalogs of random groups where generated within the same volume as the real groups , with a velocity distribution corresponding to the best third - degree polynomial fit to each @xmath66 distribution .",
    "the choice on the actual group distribution rather than that for the galaxies , is motivated by the fact that even though both present similar behavior , by using the group distribution it is possible to avoid biases caused by the distribution of galaxies in low density regions devoid of richer groups .",
    "errors were derived from the bootstrap resampling technique developed by @xcite with 30 bootstrap samples .",
    "we estimated @xmath23 for three samples , taking into account different intervals of group masses , @xmath9 , which represents , also , three distinct @xmath11 values . in order to deal with reasonable number of systems in the subsamples ,",
    "the adopted mass limits are : @xmath18 , ( 397 groups , sample 1 ) ; @xmath19 , ( 268 groups , sample 2 ) ; and @xmath20 , ( 167 groups , sample 3 ) .",
    "the lower limit in the first sample corresponds to the typical mass of the group with four @xmath74 members , the upper limit in the three samples was chosen to avoid groups with masses greater than the estimated mass of the virgo cluster , ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath23 for the total sample of guzc groups is shown if figure 4 .",
    "the correlation function gives a positive signal up to @xmath75 and it has a similar shape to the one for the galaxies .",
    "the results for the three constrained subsamples are shown in figure 5 , 6 and 7 for the range of masses corresponding to samples 1 , 2 and 3 respectively . by the inspection of figures 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 it is possible to notice that the behavior of @xmath23 for all the four samples is consistent with a power - law .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function presents a tendency to increase , as far as we have a predominance of more massive groups .",
    "we have used the levenbergh - marquardt method , which takes into account errors with minimum non - linear least - squares , to estimate the best fitting parameters @xmath24 and @xmath76 in the power - law approximation @xmath77 .",
    "we obtain @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) for subsamples 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .    in order to test the stability of the estimates of the correlation function against the existence of possible fake groups ,",
    "we have removed from the total sample those groups with four members and mass exceeding @xmath78 ( 48 groups ) .",
    "these massive groups with few members are subject to suspicion and could strongly contribute to the expected 10% fraction of pseudo - groups as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the correlation function for this restricted sample ( @xmath79 ) is indistinguishable within errors from that of the total sample , indicating that fake groups are not likely to generate strong systematic effects in our sample .    using the same procedure we have computed @xmath23 for the 104 groups in the gssrs2 with the results displayed in figure 8 .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath80h@xmath81 and @xmath82 . due to the small number of objects in this sample we have not attempted divisions into subsamples .",
    "a comparison of our results with those obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite is presented in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath76 values they have found , are different when compared to the one we have found for the total sample .",
    "the possible causes of the differences may be related to the small number of objects in the previous samples , to the minimum number of member galaxies assigned to groups , and also to the different @xmath28 adopted for the definition of groups , which results in the determination of groups with distinct physical properties .",
    "the different characteristic depths of the samples may also play an important role in the range of fitting @xmath23 .",
    "in particular the samples analyzed by @xcite and by @xcite , which retain most of those characteristics described above , are the ones which present the most discrepant results .",
    "we have estimated the values of @xmath11 for the subsamples in two different ways : ( a ) we compute the abundance @xmath83 of systems using @xcite mass function , in the corresponding range of masses and estimate @xmath84 .",
    "( b ) we consider that the guzc and gssrs2 catalogs are bona - fide complete out to 5000 and we fit a homogeneous distribution in the range 2000 @xmath85 5000 . taken into account",
    "@xcite we expect the loss of groups at 5000 km / s with at least 4 members less than 20% , so the second method should also provides a reliable estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting values for guzc are : @xmath86\\ h^{-1}$ ] mpc for the total sample , while @xmath87\\ h^{-1}$ ] mpc , @xmath88\\ h^{-1}$ ] mpc and @xmath89\\ h{-1}$ ] mpc for subsamples 1 , 2 and 3 respectively . for the gssrs2 , @xmath90\\ h^{-1}$ ]",
    "mpc in the range of masses @xmath18 .",
    "the numbers in square brackets correspond to the estimates using method ( b ) .",
    "both methods give consistent values of @xmath11 , provided that the typical uncertainties in @xmath11 are @xmath91 mpc .    in figure 9",
    "we plot the derived values of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath11 for the different samples of groups considered .",
    "also , are plotted in this figure the results for apm clusters according to @xcite .",
    "all the group sets present @xmath24 values higher than the universal scaling law @xmath92 by @xcite in contrast to the clusters which have a lower amplitude than predicted by this law .",
    "meanwhile , it is noticeable in this figure the shape of the @xmath93 relation is similar to that expected in hierarchical models for structure formation such as a cold dark matter scenario discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the two point correlation function for two new catalogs of groups of galaxies .",
    "the guzc catalog is the largest homogeneous sample to the present and provides a suitable data set to analyze the clustering properties of systems of galaxies of low richness .",
    "the group correlation function , for the total sample of groups , is well fitted to a power - law of the form @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 h@xmath3 mpc for values of @xmath97 mpc .",
    "a similar analysis for gssrs2 catalog produces @xmath98h@xmath3 mpc and @xmath99 .",
    "these results differ from the findings of other authors mainly due to the different groups characteristics of the samples analyzed .",
    "the results for subsamples of groups with different group mass intervals , show the tendency for higher values of @xmath24 at the small mean intergroup separations examined , when compared with the universal scaling law proposed by @xcite .",
    "correlation functions of apm clusters ( @xcite ) , x - ray confirmed abell clusters ( xbacs , @xcite ) and the results for groups presented in this paper strongly argue for a hierarchical scenario of structure formation in the universe such as cold dark matter models .          after this paper",
    "was submitted to apj , @xcite examined @xmath23 of groups relative to the one for galaxies using the uzc and ssrs2 catalogs of galaxies .",
