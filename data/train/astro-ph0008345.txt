    "globular cluster systems are thought to be good tracers of the star  formation history of their host galaxies ( see recent reviews by ashman & zepf 1998 , harris 2000 , kissler - patig 2000 ) .",
    "a variety of theories exist to explain the presence of distinct globular cluster sub  populations in many galaxies .",
    "for example , the bi ",
    "modal color distributions seen in many bright early  type galaxies can result from spiral  spiral mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , in  situ multi ",
    "phase galaxy / globular cluster formation ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ; kissler - patig , forbes & minniti 1998a ) and/or accretion / stripping mechanisms ( ct , marzke & west 1998 ; hilker , infante & richtler 1999 ) . implicit in these theories is the presence of an old , _ metal  poor _ ( halo ? ) globular cluster population which should exist in essentially all galaxies .",
    "cd galaxies have `` abnormally '' high specific frequencies ( number of globular clusters per unit galaxy light , harris & van den bergh 1981 ) and , generally , these galaxies have similar ( large ) numbers of blue and red globular clusters or a preponderance of blue clusters ( e.g.  forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) .",
    "their high specific frequencies may have resulted from augmentation of the _ low  metallicity _ component by galaxy accretion or globular cluster stripping .",
    "alternatively , star formation may have been truncated at an early stage , i.e.  they do not have too many globular clusters but rather too few stars @xcite .",
    "the globular cluster system of ngc 3311 is of particular interest for understanding galaxy and globular cluster formation because it is the next nearest cluster central cd after m87 in virgo and ngc 1399 in fornax and its specific frequency is one of the highest known @xcite .    in this context",
    "the result of @xcite was surprising . using washington ( c - t@xmath5)@xmath6 photometry from the ctio 4 m , these authors found that ngc 3311 , the central cd galaxy in the hydra cluster , had an unusually red globular cluster system with a median metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath70.31 dex .",
    "a third of the clusters were estimated to exceed solar abundance and the population of clusters near [ fe / h]@xmath0 dex , normally dominant in the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) of giant elliptical galaxies ( see above reviews ) , was found to be almost totally absent in ngc 3311 .",
    "the mdf was found to be bi  modal at the 97.6% confidence level in a kmm analysis , with peaks at [ fe / h]=@xmath8 and + 0.15 .",
    "these results meant that ngc 3311 was host to the most metal  rich globular cluster system known and required extensive pre  enrichment of the entire halo before essentially any of the stars or clusters formed .",
    "this posed serious problems for all three of the main contending scenarios for the formation of globular cluster systems .    here",
    "we examine the color distribution of the ngc 3311 globular cluster system using new data from the hst wfpc2 camera and show that this distribution is , in fact , quite normal and that the system is not especially metal  rich . a paper examining other properties of the ngc",
    "3311 globular cluster system is in preparation and will include comparisons with a number of other galaxies from our hst database .",
    "our data consist of cycle 6 wfpc2 observations . the integration times were 3700  s and 3800  s in the f555w and f814w filters , respectively , split into 4 exposures for each filter .",
    "the raw exposures were processed by the standard stsci pipeline and subsequent reduction and analysis were performed using iraf .",
    "the individual exposures were aligned using the imshift task and were then combined using imcombine .",
    "cosmic ray events were eliminated by setting the reject parameter in imcombine to crreject .",
    "a first set of background  subtracted images was generated by smoothing the original images with a @xmath9 box median filter and subtracting the smoothed images from the original images .",
    "objects were detected on the background  subtracted images using the task daofind in the daophot package within iraf @xcite and were then removed from the original images using the ishape algorithm @xcite . the object ",
    "subtracted images were then median  filtered once again and subtracted from the original images , providing our final set of background  subtracted images for further analysis .    a new object ",
    "detection process was performed on the combined , background  subtracted images in both f555w and f814w .",
    "the two object lists were then matched and aperture photometry was obtained using the phot task in daophot , using an @xmath10 pixels aperture . at the distance of ngc  3311 ( distance modulus @xmath11 , assuming pure hubble flow , @xmath12",
    "km s@xmath13 ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) , and @xmath14 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 ) one wf camera pixel corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath15 pc , so globular clusters are unresolved on our hst images .",
    "the use of a small aperture to minimize random errors is thus unlikely to introduce any _ systematic _ errors due to extendedness of the objects .",
    "we considered only the objects in the wf chips .",
    "since our wfpc2 pointings were centered on the nucleus of ngc  3311 we thus avoid the central region of the galaxy out to a radius of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the pc frames contain @xmath1720% of the total number of objects in the 4 wfpc2 chips .",
    "since we have so many clusters from the wf chips , including the pc objects does not significantly improve the statistics or alter the location of the @xmath18 peaks .",
    "pc objects do , however , require different aperture corrections and they are excluded to avoid any possible resulting systematic errors .",
    "figure 1 shows ngc 3311 , the nearby galaxy ngc 3309 , and the location of the wide field camera chips for this pointing .",
    "the photometry was calibrated to standard @xmath19 and @xmath20 magnitudes following @xcite .",
    "we calculated the aperture corrections between our @xmath10 and the standard holtzman et al .",
    "@xmath21 pixels apertures by measuring objects brighter than @xmath22 in both apertures .",
    "we found a small difference in the f555w and f814w aperture corrections of @xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "although the _ differences _ between the aperture corrections in the two filters are in good agreement with those found by other authors @xcite , the aperture corrections themselves are about 0.1 magnitude larger than the values obtained by whitmore et al .",
    "this is most likely due to the resampling of the psf that is done by imshift when aligning the images . as a check",
    ", we also carried out photometry on a combined subset of 2 images in each filter where no shifts were required ; in this case we found aperture corrections in very good agreement with those of whitmore et al .",
    "however , we are not going to refer to absolute magnitudes in this letter but only to colors , and we will use the photometry based on 4 combined images because of the better noise characteristics and superior cr rejection .",
    "we checked our results by performing an allstar psf ",
    "fitting reduction of the data .",
    "there is an insignificant affect on the location of the @xmath18 peaks ( at the level of 0.01 mag .",
    ", well within our estimated uncertainties ) and no subsequent conclusions are affected by choosing aperture rather than psf photometry .",
    "figure 2 , upper panel , is the reddening  corrected color  magnitude diagram of all objects in the wide field camera chips .",
    "an extinction correction of e@xmath24=0.13 ( from e@xmath25=0.079 , a@xmath26=0.24 , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) has been applied .",
    "note that @xcite used e@xmath25=0.045 from @xcite , corresponding to e@xmath24=0.072 , i.e.  there is a systematic difference of 0.05 mag .  in e@xmath24 between our colors and the corresponding colors quoted by secker et al .",
    "although it is in the right sense , this difference is not nearly sufficient to account for the disagreement .",
    "globular cluster candidates were selected from within the range 0.6 @xmath27 1.4 .",
    "there are 1971 candidates with @xmath28 and 882 with @xmath29 .",
    "a kmm test @xcite finds peaks at @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the magnitude interval @xmath32 ( corresponding roughly to @xmath33 ) and the distribution is bi  modal at the 94.4% confidence level .",
    "peaks are found at @xmath18 = 0.87 and 1.09 for the interval @xmath34 with bi ",
    "modality indicated at the @xmath3599.9% confidence level .",
    "changing the magnitudes thus yields consistent values for the @xmath18 peaks and we estimate that the peak colors are accurate to about 0.03 magnitudes .",
    "about half of the clusters belong to the blue population and half to the red .",
    "the lower panel in figure 2 shows a color histogram for the globular clusters down to a magnitude limit of v=25 .",
    "overplotted are the two best  fitting gaussians from the kmm analysis as well as their sum .",
    "dip statistics @xcite indicate the probability that the distribution is not unimodal . for the magnitude interval",
    "@xmath36 the dip value is 99.1% , for @xmath32 it is 98.7% and for @xmath34 it is 89.1% .",
    "the 50% completeness limit for the data is at @xmath1726.5 mag .  in v , but the observational scatter clearly increases substantially below v=25 .      to convert our @xmath18 colors to metallicities we use the relations derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these relations provide the best calibrations for the low and the high metallicity ranges , respectively . using the @xmath18 values for our brighter magnitude interval ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath37 and @xmath31 , the conversion relations yield metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath38 and @xmath39 dex and [ fe / h]@xmath40 and @xmath41 dex , for the blue and red peaks respectively .",
    "the errors introduced by the internal uncertainties of the conversion relations are around 0.3 dex .",
    "note that if we used the reddening value adopted by @xcite the peak colors would redden to @xmath42 and 1.14 , corresponding to metallicity shifts of only @xmath43 dex .",
    "these values we derive are typical for bright elliptical galaxies ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , the peaks in m87 are found at @xmath18=0.95 and 1.20 mag .",
    "@xcite corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath44 and @xmath45 dex ( using the kissler - patig et al .  relation ) .",
    "the peaks in ngc 1399 occur at @xmath460.99 and 1.18 @xcite , corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath47 and @xmath45 dex .",
    "if anything , the metal  rich peak in ngc 3311 may have somewhat lower metallicity than the metal  rich peaks in the central cds of the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "the data of @xcite were obtained under non  photometric conditions . as described in their text ,",
    "these authors clearly made every attempt to correctly calibrate their frames using conventional and appropriate techniques .",
    "however , given that our hst colors agree well with those for other central cd galaxies globular cluster systems , it seems likely that the secker et al .",
    "results suffer from a zero  point error .",
    "@xcite studied the globular clusters in ngc 3923 and reported an exceptionally red color distribution for this galaxy s luminosity .",
    "we note , however , that these observations were made on the same ctio 4 m , non  photometric , observing run as ngc 3311 and were calibrated _ a posteriori _ with the same data .",
    "we suggest that these observations be revisited in light of the differences found for ngc 3311 .    in the coma cluster",
    ", @xcite found , from hst data , that ic 4051 has a high mean globular cluster metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath48 dex ) .",
    "the color distribution appears to be unimodal with a narrow dispersion , although woodworth and harris were not able to exclude the possibility of a bi  modal distribution with two close peaks and a metal  poor population around [ fe / h]@xmath49 dex .",
    "the specific frequency of ic 4051 is high ( s@xmath50=12@xmath513 ) , comparable to those of cluster central cds , although ic 4051 is neither the central galaxy in this rich galaxy cluster nor is it exceptionally luminous ( m@xmath52 ) .    in their survey of archival hst data ,",
    "@xcite found evidence for systems dominated by metal  rich globular clusters .",
    "however , none of these cases were as extreme as ngc 3311 was previously thought to be .",
    "the existence of a blue ( metal  poor ) population in these galaxies is not excluded by these data ( because of small sample statistics ) but gebhardt & kissler - patig suggest that it is not likely to be significant , as in ic 4051 .    in summary ,",
    "no system has yet been observed to have a globular cluster color distribution as extremely red as the previous claim for ngc 3311 . in particular , _ no galaxy has yet been convincingly shown to be entirely lacking globular clusters with metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath49 dex_.      ngc 3311 represented the best case of an almost exclusively metal  rich globular cluster population .",
    "as such it raised serious questions about our understanding of globular cluster and galaxy formation , since the existence of a metal  poor population is implicit in all the current scenarios .    in the merger picture an elliptical galaxy is formed from the merger of two gas  rich spiral galaxies .",
    "the resultant galaxy contains a blue , metal  poor population of globular clusters from the progenitor spirals and a metal  rich population formed during the merger . in this scenario the metal ",
    "poor population should peak at the median metallicity of the globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies , i.e.  [ fe / h ] @xmath3 dex .",
    "it is generally recognized , though , that mergers are unlikely , by themselves , to result in high specific frequency galaxies , such as ngc 3311 ( ashman & zepf 1998 ; forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) . in the multi  phase picture ,",
    "the blue population is formed in a pre  galaxy phase , or during galaxy assembly , from relatively unenriched gas and so , by definition , is metal  poor .",
    "the red globular cluster population and the bulk of the galaxy stars are formed later from enriched material . in the accretion model , the original elliptical galaxy ( formed in a single burst )",
    "accretes smaller ( lower metallicity ) galaxies with their retinues of low ",
    "metallicity globular clusters .",
    "giant galaxies at the centers of rich galaxy clusters may also be expected to strip metal ",
    "poor globular clusters from the outskirts of neighboring galaxies . because of the globular cluster mean metallicity  parent galaxy luminosity relation @xcite accreted / stripped globulars must be , on average , of lower metallicity than those belonging to the `` seed '' elliptical .",
    "@xcite show how accretion processes and the luminosity function of galaxies will lead to bi  modal globular cluster systems in bright galaxies with blue and red peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath3 and @xmath53 dex , as generally observed .",
    "sketchy arguments can be imagined to accommodate an absence of metal ",
    "poor clusters within any of the above formation scenarios . to produce only , or predominantly , metal ",
    "rich clusters under the `` in situ '' scenario would require rapid star formation prior to cluster formation in the same star formation event . in a deep gravitational potential , the metals produced by the stars are retained and the average metallicity of the system is driven to a high value",
    "( see also woodworth & harris 2000 ) , conceivably before any clusters are formed . in accretion scenarios , the metal ",
    "poor population in the final galaxy would be minimized if small fragments / dwarf galaxies were absent from the galaxy s environment .",
    "note , though , that such a situation is less likely for a central cd galaxy .",
    "late mergers are expected to provide a significant population of metal  poor globular clusters originating in the progenitor galaxies , predominantly metal  rich systems could be explained if the progenitors were gas  rich but cluster  poor ( see also gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) .",
    "stripping can result in the preferential removal of metal ",
    "poor clusters if the metal ",
    "poor population is more extended than the metal ",
    "since stripping will act more efficiently on the more extended population , it could result in systems that are biased towards high metallicities . in this context , it is interesting to note that the halo light of ic 4051 appears truncated beyond @xmath17 30 kpc @xcite .",
    "preferentially metal  rich globular cluster systems can be accommodated by adjusting the existing scenarios .",
    "an exclusively metal  rich globular cluster population , should one be discovered , would probably be most easily accommodated in a single collapse model  an `` in situ '' galaxy formation scenario with rapid star ",
    "formation preceding cluster formation .",
    "we have shown that the color distribution of globular clusters in ngc 3311 is normal for bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is bi  modal with peaks at @xmath54 and @xmath31 , corresponding to metallicity peaks at around [ fe / h@xmath3 and @xmath4 ( the precise values being dependent on the choice of the conversion relation between color and metallicity ) .",
    "this range of metallicities is normal for bright elliptical galaxies , a result which contradicts an earlier claim that ngc 3311 might host an extremely metal  rich globular cluster system .",
    "we suggest that it is worth revisiting the globular cluster system of ngc 3923 whose globular cluster system was reported to be very red on the basis of observations made on the same run which produced the ngc 3311 results .",
    "although the evidence for _ exclusively _ metal  rich globular cluster systems has been weakened , there are still cases of galaxies whose globular cluster systems may lack a significant metal  poor component .",
    "we have briefly discussed the implications of such systems for our understanding of globular cluster and galaxy formation and have concluded that , with some adjustments , they can be explained under existing scenarios .",
