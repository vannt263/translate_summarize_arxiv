    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , devised to solve the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) , suffers from a serious naturalness problem associated with the dirac mass of higgsinos in the superpotential .",
    "namely , the dimensionful parameter @xmath0 contained in the superpotential    @xmath2    is nested in the supersymmetric sector of the theory , and its scale is left completely arbitrary as it is not related to the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms @xcite . a way out of this problem is to generate @xmath0 parameter dynamically via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some sm - singlet chiral superfield .",
    "the extension by a non - sm chiral superfield may or may not involve gauge extension . concerning the former , the most conservative approach is to extend the gauge structure of the mssm by an extra abelian group factor 1p along with an additional chiral superfield @xmath3 whose scalar component generates an effective @xmath0 parameter upon spontaneous 1p breakdown . what this additional gauge symmetry actually does is to forbid the presence of a bare @xmath0 parameter as in ( [ wmssm ] ) @xcite .",
    "an important property of 1p models is that the lightest higgs boson weighs significantly heavier than @xmath4 even at tree level with small @xmath5 .",
    "hence the existing lep bounds @xcite are satisfied with almost no need for large radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "besides , they offer a rather wide parameter space for facilitating the electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .    an important problem in 1p models",
    "concerns the cancellation of anomalies . indeed , for making the theory anomaly ",
    "free the usual approach to 1p models is to add several exotics to the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this naturally happens in 1p models following from susy guts @xmath6 e@xmath7 unification .",
    "however , this not only causes a significant departure from the minimal structure but also disrupts the gauge coupling unification  one of the fundamental predictions of the mssm with weak scale soft masses .",
    "therefore , it would be of greatest interest to keep gauge unification with minimal matter content .",
    "this has been accomplished in @xcite by introducing family non - universal 1p charges in a way solving all anomaly conditions , including the gravitational one .    in this work",
    ", we will discuss dilepton signatures of 1p models with universal as well as non - universal 1p charges in a comparative fashion .",
    "our discussion will include both lepton ( the ilc ) and hadron ( the lhc ) colliders . at the born level the cross sections are sensitive to exchange only .",
    "therefore , our analysis will have examined properties via dilepton signal .",
    "the collider signatures of various 1p models have already been analyzed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition , the 1p models have also been tested under electroweak precision bounds @xcite .",
    "in 1p models the mssm gauge group is extended to include an extra abelian group factor at the weak scale : su(3)@xmath8su(2)@xmath9u(1)@xmath101p with respective gauge couplings @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the particle spectrum of the model is that of the mssm plus a mssm gauge singlet @xmath15 charged under only the 1p invariance . we employ a rather general 1p charge assignment as tabulated in table [ table1 ] .    .",
    "the gauge quantum numbers of chiral superfields of @xmath16-th family . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in writing ( [ lagran ] ) we have neglected the mixing between z and bosons . this mixing can stem from kinetic mixing or can be induced after electroweak breaking @xcite.in this work we neglect such mixings in accord with the experimental bounds that @xmath17 can not exceed a few @xmath18 .",
    "this smallness of the mixing puts stringent bounds on the ranges of the soft - breaking masses as it was analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will analyze the family non - universal 1p model by considering its signatures for dilepton production at lepton and hadron colliders , separately .",
    "we will investigate distinctive signatures of the 1p model under concern with respect to a typical family universal 1p model which we choose to be the u(1)@xmath19 model following from e(6 ) gut .",
    "the requisite vector and axial - vector couplings of photon , z and bosons are tabulated in table [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] for family universal and non - universal models , respectively .    in general , the @xmath20 scattering process @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for quarks ( hadron colliders ) or leptons ( lepton colliders ) and @xmath23 for any of the charged leptons .",
    "this process proceeds with @xmath24 , z and exchanges in the @xmath25-channel when @xmath23 is not identical to @xmath22 , and in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels when @xmath27 .",
    "if center of mass energy of the collider is high enough then effects can be disentangled from those of @xmath24 and z.    after summing over final - state polarizations and averaging over the initial - state ones , the amplitude - squared of ( [ process ] ) takes the form @xmath28\\ , + \\,g(s ; v , a)\\,[(s+t)^2-t^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by @xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 in these expressions @xmath33 and @xmath34 label intermediate vector bosons @xmath35 @xmath36 , z and .",
    "the @xmath37 designates widths of the vector bosons : @xmath38 ( absolutely stable ) and @xmath39 .",
    "the width @xmath40 is a model - dependent quantity , and while making numerical estimates in what follows we will take @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , in accord with the u(1)@xmath19 model parameter space , we take @xmath42 .",
    "we first examine 1p model at a high - energy linear collider ( such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) project under preparation ) running at @xmath43 .",

    "it is seen that @xmath50 and @xmath51 completely overlap .",
    "the main reason behind this coincidence is that @xmath0 and @xmath52 leptons do have identical gauge quantum numbers ( including those of under the 1p gauge symmetry ) and their mass difference causes only a tiny deviation at such high energies @xcite .",
    "consequently , from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one concludes that numbers of muons and tau leptons produced at an @xmath46 collider will be identical ( up to systematic and statistical errors in analyzing the experimental data ) if the new gauge symmetry , the 1p symmetry under concern , exhibits identical couplings for each fermion ( at least lepton ) family as happens in the standard electroweak theory .    in clear contrast to the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one observes that @xmath47 and @xmath48 differ by an order of magnitude if the 1p symmetry possesses non - universal couplings to fermions ( at least leptons ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] is the production cross sections of muon and tau lepton final states with family non - universal 1p .",
    "it is clear in fig.[fig2 ] that family non - universal 1p signal is quite clean and distinguishable as the muon and tau lepton production cross sections are as much as several hundreds of picobarns .",
    "however , these productions are observed to be around few picobarns in various analysis @xcite and since such a clear and distinct signal has not been observed in lep @xcite , it can easily be said that family non - universal lies beyond the discovery limit of lep .",
    "[ htbp ]        in conclusion , at linear colliders , which provide a perfect arena for precision measurements , one can determine if the new gauge symmetry , if any , which extends the sm gauge group exhibits family universal or non - universal couplings by simply counting the number of lepton pairs produced .",
    "this aspect is quite important since family non - universality might signal anomaly cancellation in abelian extended models as shown in @xcite .",
    "the most important hadron machine to come up is the large hadron collider ( lhc ) which is a proton - proton collider running at @xmath58 center of mass energy . at the parton level",
    "dilepton production processes are started by quark ",
    "anti - quark annihilation into lepton pairs via @xmath25-channel @xmath24 , z and exchanges .",
    "the hadronic cross section is related to the partonic one via @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for probability of finding parton ( quark ) @xmath61 within the hadron @xmath62 with a longitudinal momentum @xmath63 time that of the hadron .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 stands for color averaging over initial - state partons and it equals @xmath65 for @xmath66 annihilation .    depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are @xmath67 and @xmath68 for family universal ( in the left panel ) and non - universal ( in the right panel ) models . from the left - panel it is clear that the two cross sections coincide , that is , an additional 1p symmetry with universal couplings to fermion ( at least lepton ) families is expected to lead equal numbers of @xmath46 and @xmath69 pairs at the lhc .",
    "this observation is similar to what we found while analyzing ilc signatures in sec .",
    "3.1 above because of the fact that u(1)@xmath19 model possesses family universal couplings and mass difference between muon and electron can not induce an observable effect on cross sections at such a high - energy collider @xcite .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows muon and electron production cross sections at tevatron with family non - universal 1p .",
    "nevertheless the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments are expected to probe roughly in the range of 200 - 800 gev masses for various models , thus tevatron experiments put strong limits on masses in agreement with the limits set by the lep experiments . as it is understood in fig.[fig4 ] ,",
    "family non - universal 1p by being out of the limits is excluded at tevatron with current bounds .",
    "[ htbp ]        before closing this section , we put strong emphasis on the fact that family non - universal 1p offers observable signatures in dilepton signal in both linear and hadron colliders . in this sense",
    ", the lhc , which is expected to start operation in coming years , will be able to establish existence / absence of an additional 1p symmetry in general and a family non - universal 1p in particular .",
    "the latter will have easier observational characteristics because all that matters is the measurement of the ratios of events with different lepton flavors .",
    "in this work we have contrasted family universal and non - universal 1p models via their dilepton signatures in future linear ( the ilc ) and hadron ( the lhc ) colliders .",
    "these production signatures are also observable in current colliders , and there are more stringent bounds on from precision electroweak experiments and from direct searches in lep @xcite and tevatron @xcite .",
    "the limits are model dependent because of the different couplings to fermions but typically the mass of a light is comparable with z ( @xmath73 ) and the heavy one is around 500 - 800 gev with small mixings @xcite .",

    "[ fig4 ] is family non - universal 1p at tevatron in a similar fashion with lhc analysis . and",
    "again the family non - universality is at the difference in production cross sections of different flavors . as a result ,",
    "family non - universal is out of limits set by various experiments in lep and tevatron .    from discussions in sec .",
    "3.1 and sec .",
    "3.2 we conclude that in both colliders ( depending on systematic and statistical error bars in experimental data ) one can establish existence / absence of a family non - universal 1p model .",
    "this search is actually easier than direct search since all that matters is the ratio of production cross sections of different lepton flavors .    for having a clearer sense of search at colliders",
    ", it would be useful to analyze decay patterns of boson into different flavors of matter .",
    "in general , a boson of mass @xmath74 decays into a fermion @xmath22 and anti - fermion @xmath75 with a rate @xmath76 directly proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , if a certain number of bosons are produced ( bosons can be copiously produced at the lhc ) then their decays into different fermion pairs gives information about the underlying structure of the 1p model .",
    "indeed , one expects at all grounds @xmath77 in any 1p model ( may it follow from e(6 ) or from strings ) in which couples to each lepton family in a universal fashion",
    ".    however , the same ratios of the decay rates become @xmath78 in the 1p model of @xcite in which couples to different lepton families differently ( as listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ table3 ] ) . that the decay rates can significantly ( depending on the model parameters ) deviate from unity",
    "is a highly interesting signature for collider searches for a family non - universal 1p gauge symmetry .    from the analyzes presented above",
    "we conclude that a 1p gauge symmetry with non - universal couplings to lepton families offers unique observational signatures for collider searches via dilepton production .",
