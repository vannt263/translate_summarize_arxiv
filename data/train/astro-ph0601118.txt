    "the role of the environment on galaxy evolution is still not fully understood . in order to quantify and set limits on the role of nurture one must identify and study a sample of isolated galaxies",
    ". the amiga project , `` analysing the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies '' , is doing a multi - wavelength study of a large sample of isolated galaxies in order to examine their star formation activity and interstellar medium ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "2005 , http://www.iaa.csic.es/amiga.html ) .",
    "our sample of isolated galaxies gathers 1051 objects , listed in the catalogue of isolated galaxies ( cig - karachentseva 1973 ) .",
    "all of the cig objects are found in the catalogue of galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( zwicky et al .",
    "1960 - 1968 ; cgcg ) with @xmath1 @xmath2 15.7 and @xmath3 -3@xmath4 ( @xmath2 3% of the cgcg ) .",
    "the cig sample was assembled with the requirement that _ no similar sized galaxies with diameter d ( between 0.25 and 4 times diameter d of the cig galaxy ) lie within 20d_.    starting from the complete catalogue , we first remove from our study all galaxies with v @xmath2 1500 km s@xmath5 ( 101 cigs ) , because the area searched for potential companions of the very nearby cigs would be extremely large .",
    "we reevaluate isolation using an automated star - galaxy classification procedure on large digitised poss - i fields surrounding each cig galaxy .",
    "the images are reduced using aimtool in lmorpho ( odewahn 1995 ) , and gui - driven star - galaxy separation procedure is used to classify detected sources as : star , galaxy or unknown .",
    "then , we define , compare and discuss various criteria to quantify the degree of isolation for these galaxies : e.g. karachentseva s revised criteria , local surface density computations , estimation of the external tidal force affecting each isolated galaxy .",
    "we also apply our pipeline to a subsample of abell clusters , hickson compact groups and triplets of galaxies which serve as control samples .",
    "on 1 - 2 metre class telescopes , we observed all the cig spiral galaxies with recession velocities between 1500 km s@xmath5 and 5000 km s@xmath5 , which represent photometric ccd data for a sample of about 200 isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "we focused on the fourth part of them ( the bigest and less inclined galaxies ) for a detailed morphological study , estimating the angular momentum transfer and therefore the evolution time for bars in isolated galaxies , to be compared with galaxies in denser environments .",
