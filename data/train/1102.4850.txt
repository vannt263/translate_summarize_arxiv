    "the galaxy autocorrelation varies with redshift , owing to the evolution of large scale structure , and because the use of a flux - limited sample means we select more luminous galaxies at higher @xmath6 .",
    "this will affect the measurements of relative bias between quasars and galaxies , since the redshift distribution of the quasars peaks at higher @xmath6 than that for the galaxies and so relatively higher-@xmath6 galaxies dominate the cross - correlation signal . to account for this in our measurement of galaxy autocorrelation , we randomly select galaxies based on the overlap of the pdfs with the quasars in comoving distance ( in the formalism of   [ crosscorr ] this is @xmath86 for each galaxy , averaged all quasars ) .",

    "the fact that we obtain very similar estimates of @xmath170 for the obs - qsos from a simple angular cross - correlation analysis as from our @xmath3 calculation suggests that uncertainties on individual photo-@xmath6s do not strongly affect our estimates of the quasar bias , as long as the overall distribution in redshifts for the obs - qsos is correct .",
    "however , it is possible that very large discrepancies from the true photo-@xmath6s , or any systematic shift in the redshift distribution , could affect both the estimate of @xmath3 and the real - space clustering parameters derived from @xmath108 .    to precisely explore the effect of these errors , we take advantage of the fact that we have an equivalent sample of objects ( the qso-1s ) that have a similar redshift distribution and for which the redshifts are known precisely from spectroscopy .",
    "we can therefore adjust the redshifts of the qso-1s and re - calculate @xmath3 to determine how uncertainties or systematic shifts affect the observed correlation amplitude . as a simple first test",
    ", we calculate the @xmath3 for the qso-1s using the photo-@xmath6s ( as shown in figure  [ fspz ] ) rather than spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fagn5pz ] shows that the resulting @xmath3 differs little from that obtained using spectroscopic redshifts ; the clustering amplitude for a power - law fit with fixed @xmath189 is lower by 12% .",
    "note that if we allow @xmath149 to float , the average bias for the photo-@xmath6 sample is actually larger by @xmath210% ( owing to a slightly flatter slope ) but well within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that for the qso-1s , photo-@xmath6 errors do not have a significant effect on our measurements of the clustering .",
    "to explore photo-@xmath6 errors in more detail , we systematically test the effects of gaussian random errors in the quasar redshifts . for each quasar",
    ", we shift the best estimates of redshift ( spec-@xmath6s for qso-1s and photo-@xmath6s for obs - qsos ) by offsets @xmath254 selected from a gaussian random distribution with dispersion @xmath255 . using these new redshifts we recalculate @xmath3 , using the full formalism described in   [ corranal ] .",
    "we perform the calculation ten times for each of several values of @xmath255 from 0.02 up to 0.2 ( which smears the redshifts across most of the redshift range of interest ) . to ensure that this step does not artificially smear out the redshift distribution beyond the range probed by the galaxies , we require that the random redshifts lie between @xmath0 ; any random redshift that lies outside this range",
    "is discarded and a new redshift is selected from the random distribution . for each trial",
    "we obtain the relative bias by calculating the mean ratio of @xmath3 , on scales 110 @xmath14 mpc , relative to the @xmath3 for the best estimates of redshift .",
    "we then average the ten trials at each @xmath256 to obtain a relation between relative bias and @xmath256 , shown in figure  [ ftest_fake_box](a ) .",
    "as may be expected , figure  [ ftest_fake_box](_a _ ) shows that shifting the qso-1 redshifts from their true values causes a decrease in the cross - correlation amplitude , as the quasars are preferentially correlated with galaxies that are not actually associated in redshift space .",
    "we find a monotonic decrease in relative bias with @xmath256 , from @xmath257 for @xmath258 to @xmath259 for @xmath260 . repeating this calculation for",
    "the obs - qsos reveals a very similar trend .",
    "the decrease in bias with @xmath255 shown in figure  [ ftest_fake_box](_a _ ) indicates that such errors would affect the measurements of the clustering amplitude by at most @xmath720% .      while the above analysis suggests that random errors in the obs - qso photo-@xmath6s do not strongly affect the observed clustering amplitude , it is also possible that systematic uncertainties in the photo-@xmath6 ( consistent over- or under - estimates of the redshift ) could significantly alter the observed bias . to test this , we shift the redshifts of the quasars as discussed in   [ randomerrors ] , but in place of random shifts , we compress all redshifts toward one end or the other of the @xmath0 range .",
    "( this procedure allows us to test the effects of systematic shifts in redshift while keeping the same overall redshift range . )",
    "the shift in redshift is defined by a redshift scaling parameter @xmath261 , such that    @xmath262    as an additional check we also perform a simple linear offset @xmath263 of the redshifts , allowing the redshifts to move outside the selection range of @xmath0 . as in   [ randomerrors ] , we use these new redshifts to recalculate @xmath3 via the full formalism described in   [ corranal ] , and determine the relative bias on scales 110 @xmath14 mpc .",
    "relative bias versus @xmath261 and @xmath264 are shown in figures  [ ftest_fake_box](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "for the qso-1s , the peak of the observed clustering amplitude is very close to @xmath265 , while shifting the redshifts down or up systematically decreases the bias .",
    "the obs - qsos show a similar peak near @xmath265 , indicating that the obs - qso photo-@xmath6s are not systematically offset higher or lower than the true redshifts by a large factor .",
    "we note that for the obs - qsos a slight shift to higher redshifts ( @xmath104 ) increases the clustering by a small amount ( @xmath28% ) .    finally ,",
    "we emphasize that any possible low - redshift contaminants , will serve only to decrease the observed clustering signal , as they will be completely uncorrelated in angular space with the higher - redshift sdwfs galaxies that lie in entirely separate large - scale structures . therefore the observed @xmath3 represents a robust lower limit to the clustering amplitude for the obs - qsos .",
    "we have used the ir - selected quasar sample of to measure the clustering amplitude and to estimate characteristic dark matter halo masses for roughly equivalent samples of unobscured and obscured quasars .",
    "we obtain highly significant detections of the clustering for both samples , with marginally stronger clustering for the obs - qsos . in this section",
    ", we compare our results for qso-1s to previous results on unobscured quasar clustering , speculate on physical explanations for possible stronger clustering for obs - qsos , and discuss prospects for future studies with the next generation of observatories .",
    "we compare our observed absolute bias for the mid - ir selected quasars to the clustering of optically - selected ( type 1 ) quasars , which has been well established by a number of works . among the most precise measurements to date are studies that have used data from the 2df and sdss surveys .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the evolution of the quasar 3-d autocorrelation function based on spectroscopic quasars from sdss data release 5 , and compared to previous results from spectroscopic samples from the 2qz @xcite and 2slaq @xcite , as well as the clustering of photometrically - selected quasars from sdss @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fcompare](a ) shows the redshift evolution of linear bias for type 1 quasars from these studies , taken from figure  12 of @xcite .",
    "where appropriate , we have converted the bias to our adopted cosmology using the formalism in the appendix of @xcite , assuming a shape factor @xmath266 for simplicity .",
    "figure  [ fcompare](b ) shows the corresponding estimates of characteristic @xmath17 derived from the linear bias using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the linear bias and halo masses for the qso-1s and obs - qsos are shown for comparison .",
    "it is readily apparent from figure  [ fcompare](a ) that the observed bias of type 1 quasars increases with redshift , as discussed in   [ intro ] .",
    "( these results are also consistent with a number of other quasar clustering studies using other data see e.g. , figure  15 of @xcite . )",
    "the dashed curves in figure  [ fcompare](a ) show the increase in bias with redshift for halos of constant mass , clearly showing that at all redshifts the qso-1s reside in dark matter halos of roughly a few @xmath267 @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "our measurement for the qso-1s is in excellent agreement with the evolution in linear bias and roughly constant @xmath17 observed in previous measurements of type 1 quasar clustering .    for the obs - qsos ,",
    "the best - fit bias is marginally larger ( @xmath268 ) , corresponding to a factor of roughly four difference in the characteristic @xmath17 between the qso-1s and obs - qsos ( figure  [ fcompare]b ) .",
    "as discussed above , random errors in the photo-@xmath6s can only decrease the observed clustering amplitude and the inferred @xmath17 .",
    "thus our measurement of obs - qso clustering represents a lower limit , and it is possible that the true obs - qso bias is somewhat higher ( although the results of   [ verification ] suggest the true bias may be larger by at most @xmath720% ) . based on this analysis we can make the robust conclusion that the obs - qsos are _ at least _ as strongly clustered as their qso-1 counterparts .      stronger clustering for obscured quasars would have significant implications for physical models of the obscured quasar population . in terms of unified models ,",
    "a difference in clustering between obscured and unobscured quasars would rule out the simplest picture in which obscuration is purely an orientation effect , but may be consistent with more complicated scenarios where the effective covering fraction changes with environment .",
    "alternatively , if obscuration is caused by large ( @xmath7kpc scale ) structures , then the processes that drive these asymmetries ( e.g. , mergers , disk instabilities , accretion of cold gas from the surrounding halo ) may be more common in halos of larger mass .",
    "indeed , given that some fraction of quasars might naturally be expected to be obscured by a `` unified''-model torus , any observed differences in clustering may reflect even stronger intrinsic dependence of large - scale obscuration and environment .",
    "an intriguing scenario for obscured quasars is that they represent an early evolutionary phase of rapid black hole growth before a `` blowout '' of the obscuring material from the central regions of the galaxy and the emergence of an unobscured quasar ( e.g. , figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "quasars tend to radiate at large fraction of the eddington rate ( @xcite ; although see @xcite ) , so that the similar @xmath50 for qso-1s and obs - qsos would imply that they host black holes of similar masses .",
    "any correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even if indirect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , between the final masses of black holes and those of their host halos would thus suggest that our obscured and unobscured quasars would have the same @xmath17 , as long as their black holes are near their final masses .",
    "however , if obscured quasars are in an earlier phase of rapid growth and so are in the process of `` catching up '' to their final mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then they would have a larger @xmath17 compared to unobscured quasars with the same @xmath269 . in light of recent debate as to whether black holes generally grow before or after their hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this scenario would imply that black hole growth lags behind that of the host halo .    in any physical picture ,",
    "a significant difference in clustering between obscured and unobscured quasars would also imply a difference in accretion duty cycles ( or equivalently , lifetime ) . qso-1s and obs - qsos",
    "are found in roughly equal numbers , but the abundance of dark matter halos drops rapidly with mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus implying that if one type of quasars are found in larger halos then they must be longer - lived . with our current results , we are able to rule out any model in which obscured quasars are substantially _ less _ strongly clustered or have _ shorter _ lifetimes than their unobscured counterparts . with more accurate future measurements , detailed studies of halo masses and lifetimes for obscured and unobscured",
    "quasars could place powerful constraints on evolutionary scenarios such as those described above .",
    "our results demonstrate the potential for studying the clustering of obscured quasars in extragalactic multiwavelength surveys , and the marginally significant difference in clustering we observe for obscured and unobscured quasars provides strong motivation for more precise measurements in the future .",
    "the two main avenues for progress are improvements in redshift accuracy and selection of larger samples for better statistical accuracy .",
    "upcoming sensitive , wide - field multi - object spectrographs will enable efficient measurements of redshift for large numbers of optically - faint sources and so improve calibrations of obscured quasar photo-@xmath6s , or with large enough samples , enable fully 3-d clustering studies .",
    "in addition , we will soon have the capability to detect many thousands of obscured quasars based on very wide - field observations in the mid - ir with the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ @xcite and in x - rays with erosita @xcite or the _ wide - field x - ray telescope _ @xcite . these data sets will allow us to measure obscured quasar clustering with statistical precision that is comparable to current measurements of unobscured quasars .",
    "we have used data from the botes  wide - field multiwavelength survey to measure the two - point spatial cross - correlation between unobscured ( qso-1 ) and obscured ( obs - qso ) mid - ir selected quasars in the redshift range @xmath0 . the qso-1s exhibit clustering corresponding to a typical @xmath270 @xmath14 @xmath15 , similar to previous studies of optically - selected quasar clustering .",
    "we robustly determine that the obs - qsos are clustered _ at least _ as strongly as the qso-1s , with a marginally stronger signal corresponding to host halos of mass @xmath271 @xmath14 @xmath15 ; the true clustering amplitude could be up to @xmath720% larger owing to photo-@xmath6 uncertainties for the obs - qsos that can decrease the observed correlation amplitude .",
    "our results motivate more accurate measurements of obscured quasar clustering with larger quasar samples and more accurate redshifts .",
    "if future studies confirm that obscured quasars are more strongly clustered than their their unobscured counterparts , this would rule out the simplest `` unified '' models and may provide evidence for scenarios in which rapid obscured accretion represents an evolutionary phase in the growth of galaxies and their central black holes .",
