    "we diagnose the principal source of noise from our sources and describe its mitigation with a combination of temporal and spectral filtering .",
    "we apply a strong pulsed pump at @xmath25 nm along the slow axis of our birefringent waveguide and observe the sfwm spectra shown in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] . by switching the pump polarisation to pump the fast axis (",
    "which is not phase - matched for sfwm ) , we can also record the background spectra .",
    "there is significant background evident for both the signal and idler modes shown in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] .",
    "this noise is not unique to this particular waveguide , but is representative of all the uv - written sfwm sources .",
    "fluorescence is the likely cause of this additional noise in our uv - written waveguides .",
    "the noise overlaying the signal mode is potentially caused by the non - bridging oxygen - hole center ( nbohc ) defect@xcite .",
    "this widely - studied silica defect is comprised of a dangling bond in the lattice @xmath26 and can be caused by a number of physical mechanisms , including uv illumination @xcite . this defect exhibits a broad luminescence from @xmath27 nm with a peak at @xmath28 nm which lies close to the sfwm signal .",
    "when our waveguides are pumped with a cw laser , the noise indicated by the red plot in the left of figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] disappears ( along with the sfwm ) .",
    "our hypothesis is that the high pump intensities when using an ultrashort pulsed pump allows for a multi - photon excitation of an nbohc defect , which emits over a broad spectral region including that observed in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] overlapping the signal mode .",
    "the majority of the background surrounding the idler mode in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] is also fluorescence .",
    "however , since it persists with cw pumping , it is not from the nbohc defect described above .",
    "while spontaneous raman scattering has historically been a challenge for many sfwm pair sources , the @xmath29 thz detuning of the idler from the pump implies that raman scattering is minor .",
    "this dominance of the noise by fluorescence , not raman , is confirmed in figure [ c3fig : margspec2pumps ] where the noise spectrum is measured at two different pump wavelengths .",
    "if the noise is due to fluorescence at a fixed frequency , then the noise spectrum should not change shape .",
    "however , raman emission exhibits a constant frequency detuning from the pump and thus should shift along with the pump .",
    "the right side of figure [ c3fig : margspec2pumps ] demonstrates almost no change in the background at the two widely separated pump wavelengths , confirming the majority of the noise in these uv - written guides is due to fluorescence .",
    "phasematching sfwm over a wide frequency range should , in principle , allow one to move the signal and idler frequencies to a range where this fluorescence background is minimized . in practice ,",
    "the currently available pump laser and detectors significantly constrain adjustability .",
    "our ti - sapphire pump laser can not operate below @xmath30 nm while our silicon apds monitoring the signal and idler can only operate in the range @xmath31 nm . for the multi - source experiments of interest here ,",
    "we are further constrained to the most efficient region of the detectors from @xmath32 nm .",
    "we therefore consistently operate with wavelengths @xmath33 nm , @xmath34 nm , and @xmath35 nm despite the presence of the fluorescence noise shown in figure [ c3fig : margspec2pumps ] .",
    "importantly , the proliferation of more efficient detectors at different spectral regions , particularly telecom wavelengths , will allow multi - source experiments in these spectral regions where fluorescence noise may not be a concern .",
    "the background evident in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] could significantly deteriorate source performance .",
    "noise photons in the heralding mode reduce @xmath36 by introducing false herald events that are not correlated with any photons in the idler mode .",
    "on the other hand , noise in the heralded mode causes undesired heralding of more than one photon that is reflected in an increased @xmath37 . in both cases",
    ", noise reduces the photon number correlations between the signal and idler modes upon which our source performance relies .",
    "importantly , we are able to effectively filter this background without significantly attenuating the signal and idler modes , thus maximising source performance .",
    "first , we angle - tune our spectral filters to implement a bandpass filter about the signal and idler modes which is narrow with respect to the broad fluorescence features but broad enough to allow most ( @xmath38 ) of the signal and idler modes through .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ c3fig : orcmargspecpreg2etah ] , which is plotted on the same scale as the spectra using a larger bandpass in figure [ c3fig : guide20marg ] .",
    "second , we use a home - built fpga - based coincidence counting program , with temporal resolution below its own clock period ( @xmath39 ) , to temporally filter the majority of the noise .",
    "fluorescence features in silica generally have decay times of microseconds which , for our @xmath40 mhz pulsed pump , implies a near temporally constant background",
    ". critically , the signal and idler wavepackets are of sub - picosecond duration which allows us to filter the temporally constant noise from the ultrashort pulsed sfwm by counting in coincidence with a pickoff from the pump laser . in this arrangement ,",
    "a herald is a signal photon temporally coincident with a pump pulse.this removes the majority of the noise without affecting any of the sfwm .",
    ".the heralding efficiency ( @xmath36 ) is shown for a single sfwm source .",
    "each row corresponds to an average pump power , while the columns indicate the temporal window applied with the fpga coincidence counting program .",
    "the two source experiments were run using a pump power of 80  mw whilst the three source experiments were run using a pump power of 135  mw . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : g2 ]    after this filtering , we analyze the number statistics of a single source to quantify @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ". tables [ tab : hereff]-[tab : g2 ] reveal that this combination of spectral and temporal filtering allows simultaneously high @xmath36 and low @xmath37 .",
    "table [ tab : g2 ] shows the expected behavior that increasing either the pump power or the width of the temporal filter increases @xmath37 and thus increases the contribution of higher order photon emission .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on these parameters in table [ tab : hereff ] is more complicated .",
    "the highest value is obtained for the lowest pump power and tightest temporal filtering .",
    "there is nt a monotonic decrease in @xmath36 for increasing powers and temporal windows since more noise photons in the heralded idler mode actually increase @xmath36 .",
    "however , the heralded state is not the desired single photon but rather a mixed state over the sfwm idler and noise . in our experiments ,",
    "we therefore implement tight temporal filtering and moderate pump powers to simultaneously attain high @xmath36 and low @xmath37 .",
    "minor changes to the optical alignment were made between the data taken in tables [ tab : hereff]-[tab : g2 ] and the main text .",
    "while these tables still effectively quantify the effectiveness of spectral and temporal filtering , specific values for a given pump power and coincidence window are slightly different from those in the main text due to minor changes in optical alignment .",
    "a goal of our experiment was to fabricate multiple identical sfwm sources on the same chip .",
    "we measure the sfwm spectra from many guides on the same chip as one test to assess if this was achieved .",
    "source variation manifests as a change in the spectral position of the signal and idler . attempting to measure and compare just @xmath41 or @xmath42 between sources revealed errors dominated by small shifts in @xmath43 between measurements .",
    "we therefore measure @xmath44 which is insensitive to these small pump instabilities .    figure  [ c3fig : uniformity40_3 ] shows the results of this sfwm source homogeneity test .",
    "the waveguides were uv - written in the order shown in figure  [ c3fig : uniformity40_3 ] , with guide @xmath45 written first .",
    "the majority of the waveguides are very closely matched . performing a spectral overlap calculation between all possible pairs of sources",
    "yields a mean 91% overlap with a standard deviation of 2.3% . from the figure",
    ", we find that waveguides @xmath46 exhibited a much larger @xmath44 than the remaining guides . by excluding these waveguides we find the spectral overlap between the remaining 18 sources increases to @xmath47 .",
    "the physical cause for this deviation amoung guides @xmath46 remains uncertain , but is rare and was not observed on other uv - written chips .",
    "the remainder of the sources are well - matched with a slowly decreasing birefringence farther into the writing process .",
    "there are at least two possible causes for this gradual drift .",
    "non - uniformity in the wafer from which this chip was diced could gradually change the stress , and thus the birefringence , across the chip .",
    "secondly , hydrogen is diffused into the chips to enhance their photosensitivity , this hydrogen gradually outgasses over the course of the writing processes causing the magnitude of the uv - induced index change to decrease over time .",
    "these minor variations aside , the availability of many sources with nearly - identical spectra was more than sufficient for our experiment to proceed .",
    "all results presented in the main text are from guides @xmath48-@xmath49 .",
    "pumping our uv - written sfwm sources for extended periods of time causes a gradual decrease in the signal and idler detuning from the pump .",
    "figure  [ c3fig : anneal ] shows this spectral shift for two waveguides , each of which are pumped with the same average power over the course of several days .",
    "this spectral shift does not occur when the guides are pumped with a continuous wave source of equivalent power and center wavelength .",
    "this indicates the shift is related to the high peak intensities present in the waveguide when an ultrashort pulsed pump is used .",
    "we hypothesize that the proximity of our pump wavelength , @xmath50 nm , to a subharmonic of the absorption feature at 240 - 250 nm targeted by the uv - writing process may play a role .",
    "it is possible that multi - photon absorption from the pulsed pump at @xmath51 nm may modify the photosensitive silica through the same mechanism as that used to fabricate the waveguides .    before each interference experiment",
    ", we separately pump all involved sources until they spectrally match one another .",
    "this procedure is used to correct for sources which are pumped different amounts of time during experimentation in order to replicate the inter - source homogeneity shown in figure  [ c3fig : uniformity40_3 ] immediately after fabrication . during subsequent periods of extended use , figure  [ c3fig : anneal ] demonstrates that the signal and idler spectra remain well - matched between multiple sources despite gradually shifting in time . in other words , while the phasematched wavelengths slowly shift , they do so consistently from guide to guide and thus high - visibility interference experiments can run for days as sources remain spectrally matched throughout .",
    "importantly , we have noted that this spectral shift is not the limiting factor in stability when running sources for extended periods of time .",
    "for example , spatial mode coupling and the optical path length matching degrade more quickly than the spectral match .",
    "the main motivation for pursuing uv - written sfwm sources was to achieve excellent inter - source homogeneity to allow high - visibility hom interference .",
    "the excellent initial source uniformity in figure  [ c3fig : uniformity40_3 ] and the repeatable annealing demonstrated in figure  [ c3fig : anneal ] show that this goal is achievable",
    "in this section we describe the numerical model used to simulate the expected click statistics from the fiber tritter considered in this work .",
    "there are three main sources of experimental error we account for in our model : photon distinguishability , photon state purity and higher - order sfwm pair emission .",
    "we first calculate the output state probabilities associated with the tritter when partially distinguishable photons are sent in .",
    "we use a method based on matrix permanents to calculate the transition probabilities associated with specific input and output states .",
    "although this method has been used previously in the modeling of multi - photon interference  @xcite , in these cases the effects of partially distinguishable input photons were treated separately and added on to the model . in this work",
    "we instead implement a recently developed modification  @xcite to this method which includes the effects of partial distinguishability from the beginning .",
    "following the treatment presented in reference  @xcite , we consider @xmath52 photons prepared in the input of a scattering setup characterized by a unitary @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 .",
    "the initial distribution of particles is defined by the mode occupation list @xmath55 , where @xmath56 photons populate input mode @xmath57 .",
    "our aim is to calculate the probability that we will find the photons in a specific output state , @xmath58 . in a similar fashion to previous work involving the matrix permanent , unoccupied input and output ports",
    "have no effect on the calculated probabilities and so we need only work with the _ effective _ scattering matrix , @xmath59 , which is formed as a sub - matrix of @xmath54 by taking rows and columns of the populated modes : @xmath60 where the mode assignment lists , @xmath61 indicate the mode in which the @xmath57th photon resides .",
    "we now consider the effect of distinguishability between the input photons .",
    "we pool all possible distinguishing degrees of freedom of the photon in the @xmath57th input mode into an internal state , @xmath62 and assume all particles in the same input spatial mode are identical .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 contains all the information that may potentially allow one to distinguish the photon in mode @xmath57 from another in mode @xmath63 other than the mode number itself - this includes all of frequency , time and polarisation .",
    "this mutual distinguishability information is encoded in the hermitian positive - definite @xmath64 distinguishability matrix , @xmath65 where @xmath66 . with these definitions",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the probability of an output event @xmath67 given an input state @xmath68 described by a distinguishability matrix @xmath69 is given by the multi - dimensional tensor permanent : @xmath70 where the @xmath71-dimensional three - tensor is defined as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 represent permutations of the output state , @xmath67 , and @xmath75 denotes the complex conjugate of matrix @xmath76 with rows permuted according to @xmath73 and columns permuted according to @xmath74 .",
    "the normalisation factor , @xmath77 is necessary to account for the possibility of multiply occupied input and output modes .",
    "this formalism can be straightforwardly extended to mixed input states by replacing the scalar products that appear in the matrix definition of the distinguishability matrix ( given in equation  ( [ eq : s - matrix ] ) ) , by their ensemble average .",
    "we assume that the input photons are uncorrelated in any of their internal degrees of freedom ( as is expected for three independently heralded photons ) so that we can express each photon entering the @xmath57th occupied mode as being in the internal state @xmath78 with probability @xmath79 , @xmath80 with @xmath81 describing the maximal number of states in any pure - state decomposition across all input photons .",
    "the above expression for the event probability is then simply modified so that equation  ( [ eq : multiperm ] ) becomes : @xmath82}(\\vec{r},\\vec{s } ) = \\sum_{k_1,\\dots , k_n=1}^r\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^np_{j , k_j}\\right)\\mathcal{p}_{\\mathcal{s}[\\vec{k}]}(\\vec{r},\\vec{s}),\\ ] ] where @xmath83 $ ] defines a particular @xmath69-matrix given by : @xmath84={\\left\\langle \\phi_{j , k_j } \\middle\\vert \\phi_{l , k_l } \\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ]      ideally , in our experiment , the input state remains fixed since we always want to inject three , single photon fock states into each of the three input ports of the fibre tritter .",
    "therefore we would set @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and compute the probability for each of the three output terms we are interested in , namely , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) using the expression given in equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) .",
    "however , we do not generate ideal single photon states since our sources are contaminated by higher - order photon pair terms .",
    "if we assume ( for the purpose of this section ) that our source is spectrally single mode , we can simply write down the two - mode squeezed state that is generated within our waveguided source : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote signal and idler modes and @xmath93 is a generalised squeezing parameter determined by the pump power and strength of the @xmath94 non - linearity in silica . in our experiment , we herald on the signal mode in order to prepare approximate single photon fock states in the idler mode .",
    "however , in practice our source , filters and accompanying optical setup have losses , and the heralding detector does not have unit efficiency and can not resolve the number of photons in the signal mode .",
    "we let @xmath95 be the global loss on the heralding signal mode which accounts for all of these effects ( including detector efficiency ) , and @xmath96 be the loss associated with the source on the idler mode - i.e. @xmath96 accounts for all losses from the source up until the fibre tritter .",
    "the effect of this loss ( after tracing over the loss modes ) is to transform the ideal state in equation   into a binomial distribution over photon numbers  @xcite : @xmath97 starting with this state we now use an apd to herald on the signal mode which reduces the state on the idler mode to : @xmath98 where the apd ` click ' povm element is given by @xmath99 .",
    "we can write this out explicitly in terms of a classical mixture of input fock states to our fibre tritter : @xmath100 where we have defined : @xmath101 the input to the fibre tritter consists of three such heralded states , @xmath102 , so that the lowest order terms ( @xmath103 ) in our input state contains terms that go as @xmath104 . in our model",
    "we keep all terms up to @xmath105 , which is sufficient to obtain an error of less than 1% when @xmath106 as is the case in our experiment .",
    "for example , expanding up to @xmath107 for each of the input terms and grouping photon numbers we have : @xmath108 when we compute the tensor product of this state to derive our three photon input we would be left with @xmath109 separate terms to compute .",
    "however , since we post - select on measuring three - photons after the tritter we can ignore all of those terms which contain less than a total of three photons at the input ( since the probability for this event from equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) is trivially zero ) .",
    "we also ignore all of those terms of order @xmath110 and above .",
    "this reduces the number of actual possible input states we must worry about to 22 .",
    "because we have assumed there are no correlations between the initial input modes , we simply perform the calculation for all possible 22 input states , and calculate all possible output state probabilities that could have led to a successful coincidence outcome using equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) to also account for the effects of modal distinguishability and mixedness .",
    "for example , one of the error terms from higher order emission leads to the input state @xmath111 occasionally being input to the tritter when the central source emits a double pair . if we are calculating the probability for the output state to be @xmath112 , during the loop we then set the input state to @xmath113 and use equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) to calculate the output probabilities for each of the terms which could lead to us detecting the @xmath112 term : @xmath114 .",
    "we sum each of these contributions and then move on to the next possible input state , for example @xmath115 and repeat .",
    "the final probability is then calculated by summing the contributions from each possible input state and weighting them by the appropriate coefficient given in equation  ( [ eq : inputstate ] ) .        * * unitary matrix , @xmath54 : * we found that within our experimental precision ( about 5% ) , our fibre tritter implements the ideal operation and equally splits each input mode across all three output modes .",
    "we also assumed negligible loss within the fibre tritter since we were unable to accurately measure this independent of the connector losses on both input and output ports .",
    "therefore we assumed the fibre tritter itself was well - described by a unitary matrix .",
    "all @xmath116 unitary matrices can be fully characterised ( up to unimportant input and output phases ) using only knowledge of the splitting ratios of all input ports  , which allows us to immediately write down our unitary transformation without having to characterise the internal phases : @xmath117 * * photon purity matrix , @xmath118}$ ] : * full quantum state tomography in every degree of freedom is difficult to implement experimentally for single photons , and in fact has never been fully demonstrated . instead",
    ", we make a number of simplifying assumptions that allows us to make a good approximation to the description of the photon distinguishability / purity matrix @xmath118}$ ] .",
    "first , we assume each photon can be decomposed into a classical mixture across two orthogonal modes ( i.e. setting @xmath119 in equation  ( [ eq : mixedstate ] ) ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is related to the purity of the photon through @xmath122 .",
    "our first step is to estimate the purity of each photon , and so recover the coefficients required in equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) .",
    "one particularly convenient method for measuring the purity is to make a measurement of the second - order auto - correlation of the idler mode , @xmath123  @xcite . a pure two - mode squeezed state",
    "will show thermal statistics ( @xmath124 ) on its marginal modes .",
    "however , if there is any mixture ( in any degree of freedom ) this will show up as a decrease in the @xmath123 toward 1 .",
    "+ whilst other experiments have managed to use this method  @xcite , we were not able to make accurate marginal measurements of @xmath123 because of the presence of uncorrelated noise on each of the marginal photons as explained in section  [ sec : noise ] . with improved temporal filtering we anticipate being able to make this measurement on our source by counting in coincidence with the pump laser pulse .",
    "+ instead , for the purpose of this model , we use the theoretically expected purity .",
    "since we use single spatial mode waveguides and perform polarisation filtering , we expect to have mixture only in the spectral degree of freedom .",
    "using the known dispersion properties of silica , together with the measured birefringence of our waveguide and the shape and position of the spectral filters , we can compute the theoretical joint spectral amplitude for our source  @xcite . taking the singular - value - decomposition of this function directly returns the expected source purity , which we calculate as @xmath125 .",
    "we further assume that this purity is identical for all three photons .",
    "+ the entries of the @xmath69-matrix depend only on the _ overlap _ between the single photon states ( see equation  ( [ eq : s - matrix ] ) ) and so we let the first photon fully define the first basis mode ( including spatial , spectral and polarisation modes ) and parameterise the other two photons with respect to the first photon so that the six relevant photon wavefunctions become : + [ eq : wavefunctions ] @xmath126 + we can now estimate the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 by looking at the visibility of the measured two - photon hom dips presented in the main figure  [ fig:2source ] .",
    "the visibility is given by @xmath129 , and if we already know the purity of both photons ( i.e. we know that @xmath130 ) , then we can infer the value of @xmath127 and @xmath128 from the value of visibility of the hom - dips between photons 1 and 3 and photons 1 and 2 as is done in the main text .",
    "the relevant measurements are shown at the bottom of figure 4 as results ` 1&4 ' and ` 1&5 ' ( since in this measurement , sources [ ` 1',`2',`3',`4',`5 ' ] correspond to waveguides [ ` 20',`18',`19',`21',`22 ' ] respectively .",
    "the three sources used in the main experiment are using guides 20,21 and 22 ) .",
    "the background - subtracted visibility for both of these measurements is 0.957 leading to @xmath131 .",
    "+ we now have all the information needed to compute the @xmath132 necessary @xmath69-matrices in equation  ( [ eq : mixedperm ] ) . *",
    "* signal mode loss , @xmath95 : * since we define the loss of the signal mode to include all the effects from photon production through to detection , a klyshko - style efficiency measurement is all that is required  @xcite . following the procedure outlined in ref  @xcite",
    ", we obtain an average efficiency on the signal arm of each source of @xmath133 . * * idler mode loss , @xmath96 : * this efficiency is only defined up until the point of the fibre tritter .",

    "<S> interference between independent single photons is perhaps the most fundamental interaction in quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> it has become increasingly important as a tool for optical quantum information science , as one of the rudimentary quantum operations , together with photon detection , for generating entanglement between non - interacting particles . despite this </S>",
    "<S> , demonstrations of large - scale photonic networks involving more than two independent sources of quantum light have been limited due to the difficulty in constructing large arrays of high - quality single photon sources . here </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the key challenge , reporting a novel array of more than eighteen near - identical , low - loss , high - purity , heralded single photon sources achieved using spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) on a silica chip . </S>",
    "<S> we verify source quality through a series of heralded hong - ou - mandel experiments , and further report the experimental three - photon extension of the entire hong - ou - mandel interference curves , which map out the interference landscape between three independent single photon sources for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum states of many particles offer an opportunity to study the rich physics of large - scale quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> light provides the possibility of building such quantum states under ambient conditions , both because photons are robust to dephasing due to minimal interaction with their environment and one another , and because entanglement can be generated between photons allowing the observation of strong quantum phenomena in everyday settings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , quantum optical networks are expected to enable new technologies - spanning communications , distributed sensing , simulation , and computation - characterized by performance that dramatically exceeds their classical counterparts  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement can be established across such a quantum network through quantum interference of independent single photons and measurement using a photodetector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the archetype of this interaction is the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) effect  @xcite , whereby two photons from independent sources coalesce at a beam splitter , always leaving at the same output . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this approach enables the generation of entanglement directly from the bosonic properties of the underlying fields , without the necessity for the photons to interact directly .    </S>",
    "<S> a key challenge is scaling this approach to generate the large entangled networks necessary in many technological applications . over the past decade </S>",
    "<S> , rapid progress has been made in developing several of the elements necessary to construct such large - scale quantum optical states . </S>",
    "<S> high efficiency photon - counting detectors  @xcite , actively programmable circuits  @xcite , and quantum memories have all been demonstrated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a significant remaining obstacle is the demonstration of arrays of many quantum light sources that deliver single photons with low loss , high purity , and sufficient control of the full photonic modal structure that allows high quality interference .    </S>",
    "<S> the main approaches to preparing single photons in such states are either to place a single emitter in a high - finesse cavity or to use a nonlinear optical process by which photons are produced in pairs by spontaneous scattering , and the detection of one heralds the presence of the other  @xcite . both approaches offer routes to deterministic photon generation , though the latter requires effective routing of multiple pair sources  @xcite . despite this complication , </S>",
    "<S> heralded photon - pair sources have become the de - facto standard for generating quantum states of light for networking by virtue of their ease of use and operation in ordinary laboratory conditions .        </S>",
    "<S> state - of - the - art experiments have investigated the quantum interference of light originating from three and four independent sources . </S>",
    "<S> experiments of this scale , however , have required source imperfections to be compensated by narrow spectral filtering , long data collection times , and post - selected fidelity measures to show evidence of non - classical behavior  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these current photon - source limitations have prohibited detailed studies generalising the hom effect beyond two independent photons despite its wide - ranging utility in a number of important technologies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , integration of photon pair sources on - chip has been recognized as one of the most promising approaches to scaling due to their small size , direct compatibility with integrated photonic architectures , reduction in required pump power , and potentially exquisite control of the populated optical modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , fabrication imperfections or material limitations frequently spoil this dream . </S>",
    "<S> optical loss is a key parameter for any quantum light source and on - chip sources frequently suffer from large losses due to high scattering and outcoupling mode mismatch  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the phase - matching conditions for the spontaneous scattering process are highly sensitive to optical dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> even small non - uniformity in fabricating the waveguide structure can impart large changes in the joint spectrum of a generated photon pair . </S>",
    "<S> further , poor dispersion control can introduce undesired residual frequency correlations between photon pairs which reduces heralded state purity , and thus the quality of interference . </S>",
    "<S> while recent experiments have managed to integrate two  @xcite and four  @xcite individual photon pair sources on the same chip , they did not demonstrate the single photon purity necessary for performing heralded multi - photon quantum interference experiments .    here </S>",
    "<S> we solve the problem of generating multiple independent _ pure - state _ </S>",
    "<S> photons for the first time by means of a micro - fabricated waveguide array that contains 18 near - identical heralded single photon sources . </S>",
    "<S> we use our novel light source to map out , for the first time , the entire third - order correlation function arising from the interference of three independent single photons , showing genuine three - particle quantum interference .      </S>",
    "<S> our source array consists of a series of straight waveguides fabricated by uv - laser writing of a silica - on - silicon photonic chip ( figure [ fig : sourceillustration ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the silica waveguides show low propagation loss and guide nearly - circular spatial modes ( see inset to figure  [ fig : sourceillustration ] ) that are nearly identical to those of a silica fibre . </S>",
    "<S> each source is operated by injecting a pulse of horizontally polarized pump light . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) is achieved through birefringent phase matching ( see supplementary information ) and generates the desired pairs of photons with vertical polarization . appropriately matching the pump characteristics and phase - matching condition in the waveguides results in pairs of photons correlated only in their photon number , eliminating any excess frequency - time entanglement  @xcite , thereby enabling heralded photons of high purity without the need for narrowband spectral or temporal filters . </S>",
    "<S> we use a nearly transform - limited pump pulse with a 4.5-nm bandwidth and 736-nm central wavelength to generate photons centered at 670 nm and 817 nm ( see joint spectrum in figure  [ fig:2source](b ) ) . after the chip , </S>",
    "<S> the pump is removed with polarising optics and broadband spectral filters , while the photon pair is divided with a dichroic beam splitter and coupled into separate single - mode optical fibres ( see supplementary figure  [ fig : explayout ] )    each source is individually characterized by monitoring the two output fibres with silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) while pump pulses of 1nj pulse energy and @xmath0 pulse duration are injected at a rate of 80  mhz . the heralding efficiency @xmath1 is the probability that if a herald photon is detected , a photon in the heralded mode will be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath2 ( see supplementary information ) , for which the apds are the dominant cause of inefficiency , and measure a coupling efficiency of @xmath3 from the waveguide into single mode fibre making this source potentially useful for a range of loss - critical quantum applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although we observe some fluorescence noise in both modes of the source ( see supplementary information ) , this can be almost entirely removed by time - gating our measurements to within @xmath4 of the pump . </S>",
    "<S> this effectively filters the time - uncorrelated fluorescence signal whilst not affecting the single photons that have a duration @xmath5 shorter than this gating window . for the remaining work , </S>",
    "<S> the shorter - wavelength signal photon is used as the herald photon . </S>",
    "<S> we then measure an intensity autocorrelation @xmath6 of the heralded field , signifying good single - photon statistics , with the predominant error arising from multipair generation . at these conditions , heralded photons </S>",
    "<S> are detected at a rate of @xmath7 .        </S>",
    "<S> whilst these excellent single - source characteristics are a pre - requisite for use in any quantum - enhanced protocol , it is the construction of a large array of well - matched sources that has so far hindered the scaling of quantum photonic experiments . </S>",
    "<S> critically , in the present device , we find the phase - matched wavelengths of the signal and idler photons for each of our sources are highly uniform , indicating a nearly constant birefringence across the entire silica - on - silicon wafer . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication of the wafer by flame hydrolysis deposition is a well - developed technique widely used in classical photonics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method achieves a uniformity of the substrate birefringence of @xmath8 which allows us to construct an unprecedented number of identical single photon sources on the same chip .    as a exacting test </S>",
    "<S> that these waveguides are truly indistinguishable sources of pure single photons , a series of heralded two - source hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference experiments are performed pairwise between five different sources on the same chip , as shown in figure  [ fig:2source ] . </S>",
    "<S> the output of each of four sources is interfered separately with a common reference source on a balanced fibre beam splitter to confirm near - identical , high purity emission among the entire set . </S>",
    "<S> an fpga monitors the four - fold coincidences as an optical delay stage is scanned to record the hom interference curves ( see supplementary information ) . from the hom curve </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the interference visibility as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the measured coincident probability at a time delay @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed interference visibilities closely match theoretical predictions in all cases while the similarity of raw and background - subtracted visibilities is consistent with minimal noise in heralded emission . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the five sources explored here form one representative subset of the 18 sources on the chip , highlighting the potential scalability of this architecture .          </S>",
    "<S> this breakthrough in single photon source engineering ; an array of identical , pure , heralded single photon sources with sufficiently low - loss and high brightness to operate many of them simultaneously , allows us to go beyond previous studies of two - photon interference and explore the critically important regime of interference of multiple , independent single photons . </S>",
    "<S> this class of interference underpins all linear optical quantum communications , simulation and computing schemes , and obtaining high - fidelity operations based on interference is vital to understand the possibilities for scaling photonic systems to a useable capacity . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that our platform provides a route to large - scale photonics by performing an in - depth study of the entire interference landscape of three heralded photons for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum interference of three heralded single photons is studied by injecting the photons into a balanced three - port beam splitter ( a fibre - based tritter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the action of this tritter is described by a unitary matrix that maps the input field operators , @xmath12 to the output field operators @xmath13 with @xmath14 , where the fibre tritter implements the unitary transformation : @xmath15 by varying the optical time - delay of the input states , we measure the full three - time third - order correlation function of the output photon statistics for each of the possible output combinations . </S>",
    "<S> six - fold coincidence counts are recorded as a function of the two time delays using an array of silicon apds and a custom fpga - based counting unit . </S>",
    "<S> a second fibre - tritter is connected to one of the output modes to achieve pseudo photon - number resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the signal modes of each source pass through a broad spectral filter ( @xmath16 ) , the bandwidth of which is larger than the full width of the marginal spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this increases the purity of the heralded photons without significantly reducing the source brightness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this three - photon generalisation of the hong - ou - mandel experiment are shown in figure  [ fig:3source ] . </S>",
    "<S> the average six - photon coincidence count rate is @xmath17 hz  , allowing us to collect enough data to resolve subtle features in the third - order correlations among modes after interference .     and @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> is scanned and the magnitude of the visibility is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> our measured results are shown by the blue crosses . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded box represents the modeled visibility for three single photons , including the effects of higher - order pair emission and residual distinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on this model were estimated using a monte - carlo method taking into account the uncertainties in the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> black solid lines indicate the maximum theoretical visibility for ideal fock state inputs for which the full interference landscape is plotted in figure  [ fig:3source ] . </S>",
    "<S> black dashed lines indicate the maximum visibilities for classical coherent state inputs . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the complicated structure of even these third - order correlation functions is indicative of the complexity in collective many - photon interference  @xcite . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this represents the first time such an entire third - order , three - time correlation surface has been mapped out experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to observe directly the non - monotonic behaviour of the correlation functions as the distinguishability of the photons is changed , by adjusting the relative delays of the interfering photons , and can be seen in the plots of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 output terms . </S>",
    "<S> such behaviour is realised only for quantum interference between more than 2 photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , this full correlation function clearly shows the distinction between two and three photon interference . in particular , we find the @xmath21 output term is time - delay invariant if one photon always remains distinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> the complete absence of any two - photon interference effect is accompanied by a three - photon interference term which theoretically has unit visibility . </S>",
    "<S> we find this dip occurs when all photons arrive simultaneously ( i.e. @xmath22 ) and provides strong evidence for genuine three - photon interference . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the suppression of this @xmath21 term derives from the more general fourier suppression law  @xcite that has been suggested as a stringent test of the genuine quantum interference between many single photons  @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> a full model was constructed to analyse the dependence of photon statistics on residual photon distinguishability , purity and higher - order sfwm pair emission ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results from this model are shown in figure  [ fig:3source ] . in order to quantify our </S>",
    "<S> experimentally observed three - photon visibilities , we ran a separate experiment setting @xmath23 and adjusted @xmath18 to introduce complete distinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> this one - dimensional scan allows collection of sufficient data to determine the three - photon interference contrast with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> the results are plotted in figure  [ fig:3source ] . </S>",
    "<S> the expected visibilities for classical , phase - averaged , coherent state inputs are calculated and plotted as black dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the measured visibilities clearly exceed these classical bounds . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally measured effective squeezing parameter and source loss was used to model the effects of higher - order sfwm pair emission ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , the expected photon state purity as calculated from the theoretical joint spectral amplitude , together with the overlap of the measured marginal spectra , were used to include the effects of residual distinguishability and mixedness ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results from this model are plotted as gray shaded boxes and agree very well with our measured results , confirming we have understood the primary sources of error . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we find that over @xmath24 of the visibility reduction is due to higher - order pair emission , which can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the pump power per source or using photon number resolving detectors on the herald arm .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated a new platform for constructing large numbers of identical heralded single photon sources . the ability to operate these arrays of low - loss , high purity , on - chip sources will be increasingly critical as experiments scale to building and manipulating yet larger quantum states of light . this work has already allowed us to map out , for the first time , the three - photon generalisation of the hong - ou - mandel interference landscape between independent photons . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling indicates that the observed visibilities are a result of true tripartite interference and highlight the importance of minimizing loss , not only for increasing data rates , but in reducing the relative contribution of multi - pair emission to the observed click statistics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results benefit both future source engineering and fundamental science efforts . </S>",
    "<S> such source arrays are an important component in engineering near - deterministic photon sources through active multiplexing  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . these would be useful in a wide range of quantum - enhanced technologies including metrology  @xcite , communication  @xcite , simulation  @xcite , and computation . </S>",
    "<S> however , even without multiplexing , an array of sources like that presented here is a valuable tool to probe the computational power of quantum systems  @xcite . </S>"
